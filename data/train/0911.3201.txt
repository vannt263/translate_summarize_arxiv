    "quantum coherence in mesoscopic systems is one of the major issues in modern condensed matter physics as it is intimately linked to the field of quantum information .",
    "the interaction of solid state qubits with environmental degrees of freedom strongly affects the fidelity of the qubit and leads to decoherence .",
    "consequently , the decoherence process limits significantly the performance of such devices and it is often regarded as a nuisance .",
    "it is hence important to understand the limitation to the electronic coherence not only from the fundamental point of view but also for the realization of qubit devices .    according to the fermi liquid ( fl ) theory ,  @xcite the phase coherence time @xmath0 is limited by any inelastic scattering events , such as electron - electron interactions , electron - phonon interactions or spin - flip scattering of electrons from magnetic impurities . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath0 is expected to diverge as the temperature goes to zero .",
    "contrary to this expectation , experimentally @xmath0 seems to saturate at very low temperatures .",
    "mohanty and coworkers have observed systematic low temperature saturations of @xmath0 for au wires .",
    "@xcite this experiment has triggered a controversial debate whether the low temperature saturation of @xmath0 is really _ intrinsic _ or _",
    "extrinsic_. golubev and zaikin ( gz ) have claimed that @xmath0 intrinsically saturates at zero temperature due to electron - electron interactions in the ground state .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , this low temperature saturation of @xmath0 can also be explained by various extrinsic reasons such as the presence of dynamical two level systems ,  @xcite the presence of a small amount of magnetic impurities ,  @xcite radio frequency assisted dephasing ,  @xcite _ etc_. however , none of those extrinsic mechanisms has been able to rule out the possibility that there might be an intrinsic saturation of @xmath0 at low temperature .",
    "for example , an extremely small amount of magnetic impurities can always explain the observed saturation of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite this fact shows that one can not clearly discriminate the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms only from the temperature dependence of @xmath0 and another parameter is needed to distinguish them .    in order to settle the important debate about the decoherence at zero temperature , we have chosen to study the disorder dependence , in other words , the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 as the two different scenarios ( fermi liquid description or intrinsic saturation ) predict different @xmath1 dependencies on @xmath0 . some attempts to measure the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0",
    "have been performed in metallic systems  @xcite as well as in semiconductor ones .",
    "@xcite however , any clear conclusion could not be drawn from those experiments , since it is difficult to vary @xmath1 in a controlled way over a wide range .    in this article",
    ", we report on the electronic phase coherence time @xmath0 measurements in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires and two - dimensional ( 2d ) hall bars fabricated from a high mobility 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) . using an original ion implantation technique , as detailed in the next section",
    ", we can vary the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 over three orders of magnitude without changing any other parameter , such as electron density , band structure _ etc_. in our previous work on the low temperature decoherence as a function of @xmath1 ,  @xcite we have presented mainly results for one quasi-1d wire . here",
    "we present an exhaustive report concerning the disorder dependence for quasi-1d wires as well as 2d hall bars .",
    "the dimensionality defined in this paper is determined in terms of the phase coherence length @xmath2 as follows ; when @xmath3 is larger than the width of wire @xmath4 but smaller than the length of wire @xmath5 , the system is  quasi-1d \" . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath6 , it is ",
    "2d \" . depending on the range of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1",
    ", several different regimes can be attained for quasi-1d systems , i.e. ballistic , semi - ballistic , diffusive , and strongly localized regimes . in this work ,",
    "we present decoherence measurements in the semi - ballistic , diffusive , and strongly localized regimes for the quasi-1d system as well as in the weakly and strongly localized regimes for the 2d system .",
    "the article is organized as follows ; in the next section , experimental details are described . in sec .",
    "iii , we review theories on the phase coherence time and weak localization ( wl ) in the diffusive ( or weakly localized ) regime , and then present experimental results in this regime . the results on the wl curves and the phase coherence time in the semi - ballistic regime are presented in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to the discussion of the disorder dependence of the decoherence in the quasi-1d wires . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the _ effective electron temperature _ in our samples as it is a very important issue when discussing decoherence at zero temperature . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we present data for decoherence in the strongly localized regime .",
    "samples have been fabricated from a gaas / algaas heterostructure grown in ultra high vacuum by molecular beam epitaxy with electron density @xmath7 @xmath8 and mobility @xmath9 @xmath10v@xmath11s at a temperature of @xmath12 k in the dark and before processing .",
    "all lithographic steps are performed using electron beam lithography on polymethyl - methacrylate ( pmma ) resist .",
    "firstly , ohmic contacts have been patterned by evaporating an augeni alloy onto the wafer .",
    "the wafer has been subsequently annealed at 450 @xmath13c for a few minutes in a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "secondly , our desired nanostructures ( wires , hall bars , _ etc _ ) have been etched into the mesa by argon ion milling over a depth of 5 nm using an aluminium mask .",
    "the mask has then been removed with a naoh solution .",
    "such a _ shallow etching _ results in highly specular reflection on the boundaries of the sample ,  @xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "iv b.    a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of a typical sample used in this work is shown in fig .",
    "[ sem_image ] .",
    "each sample consists of 4 sets of wires of length @xmath14 @xmath15 m and of lithographic width @xmath16 600 , 800 , 1000 and 1500 nm . in order to suppress universal conductance fluctuations ( ucfs ) , each set consists of 20 wires connected in parallel . in addition , a hall bar allows to measure the electronic parameters of the 2deg : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , elastic mean free path @xmath19 , elastic scattering time @xmath20 , _ etc_. the diffusion coefficient is obtained via the relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fermi velocity .",
    "we summarize the fomulas for the electronic parameters in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".formulas of some electronic parameters .",
    "the drude conductivity @xmath23 is obtained from the hall bar .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     similar behavior of @xmath24 and exponential divergence of resistance in quasi-1d conductors have already been reported by gershenson and co - workers .",
    "@xcite they claim that ( i ) the exponential divergence of resistance is due to the activation law , ( ii ) the crossover temperature @xmath25 where @xmath26 is close to @xmath27 , and ( iii ) @xmath3 deviates ( saturates ) at certain temperature ( @xmath28 ) as the temperature approaches @xmath27 .",
    "these observations are _ qualitatively _ consistent with our experimental data .",
    "however , we observe clear _ quantitative _ disagreement among the three different temperatures @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath27 which are more or less similar in refs .   and  .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to investigate theoretically the detailed mechanisms of @xmath3 and @xmath29 in quasi-1d conductors near the crossover point from the weakly localized to strongly localized regime .    in this section",
    "we have confirmed that in the strongly localized regime the phase coherence time is diverging with a power law at low temperatures .",
    "the exponent is reduced compared to the weakly localized regime when the system approaches the strongly localized regime .",
    "let us remind however that for the extraction of the exponent we applied the wl formula in a regime where it should in principle not be valid . on the other hand , our data seems to show that the wl theory gives a very good description of the magnetoconductance of quasi-1d and 2d mesoscopic conductors beyond the weakly localized regime both in the semi - ballistic and strongly localized regimes .",
    "we have studied the disorder dependence of the phase coherence time @xmath0 of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires and two - dimensional ( 2d ) hall bars made from a 2d electron gas . by implanting locally gallium ions into the doping layer of the heterostructure using a focused ion beam microscope ,",
    "we have been able to change the electronic diffusion coefficient @xmath1 over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this allowed to explore various physical regimes , namely the semi - ballistic , the weakly localized and the strongly localized regimes . in the weakly localized regime ,",
    "the temperature as well as the diffusion coefficient dependence of the phase coherence time is in extremely good agreement with the  standard model \" of decoherence proposed by altshuler , aronov and khmelnitsky ( aak ) .",
    "in particular , for quasi-1d wires , the diffusion coefficient dependence of the phase coherence time follows a @xmath30 power law , while the temperature dependence follows a @xmath31 power law .",
    "similar observations have been found for the 2d system : the phase coherence time @xmath0 follows a @xmath32 law as expected within the aak theory .",
    "we do not see any sign of saturation of the phase coherence time down to a temperatures of 25 mk . in the semi - ballistic regime",
    "where the elastic mean free path is larger than the width of the wires , we have found a new regime where @xmath0 is independent of the diffusion coefficient . in this regime",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is identical to that of the one observed in the weakly localized regime . in the strongly localized regime , where the resistance diverges exponentially with decreasing temperature",
    ", we still observe a diverging phase coherence time , however the exponent of the power law is decreased compared to the weakly localized regime .",
