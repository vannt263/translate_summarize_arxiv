    "macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) has become a focus of interest in physics and chemistry because it can provide a signature of quantum behavior in a macroscopic system.@xcite among several works on mqt , josephson junctions have been intensively studied.@xcite heretofore , however , experimental and theoretical investigations of mqt have been focused on low-@xmath3 superconductor josesphson junctions .",
    "renewed interest in mqt occurred after the recent experimental observations of mqt in high-@xmath3 superconductor josephson junctions , e.g. , yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) grain - boundary bi - epitaxial junctions@xcite and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath4 intrinsic junctions.@xcite such fascinating results open up the possibility for realizing high-@xmath3 quantum bits ( qubits ) . over the past year",

    "as will be mentioned later , the addition of the lc circuit results in a two - dimensional potential @xmath9 which makes the dynamics much more complex than for an ordinary single junction ( see fig.1 ( b ) ) . it was found that , in the microwave - assisted mqt experiment,@xcite the bias current @xmath17 dependence of the josephson plasma frequency @xmath18 is quantitatively explained by this model.@xcite however , the validity of the extended circuit model for thermal activation ( ta ) and mqt escape processes have not yet been explored . in this paper",

    "the lagrangian @xmath30 describes the quantum dynamics of a fictive particle moving in a two - dimensional tilted washboard potential @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the escape paths traverse a two - dimensional land scape , so the macroscopic dynamics in this model becomes more complicated than that in the simple one - dimensional model .    the two - dimensional potential profile @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "the mean slope along the @xmath8 direction is proportional to the bias current @xmath17 , and the mean curvature in the diagonal direction ( @xmath31 is due to the inductive coupling between the josephson junction and capacitance @xmath5 characterized by @xmath32 .",

    "importantly , the potential barrier height @xmath36 does not depend on the lc circuit parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5.@xcite moreover , the expression of @xmath36 is identical with the barrier height for usual single josephson junctions , i.e. , one - dimensional model.@xcite    next we will derive an approximate expression of @xmath9 for @xmath39 . by introducing the new coordinate @xmath40 and assuming @xmath39 , we can rewrite the lagrangian as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the potential of the josephson junction without the lc circuit , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the josephson plasma frequency with @xmath47 being the zero - bias plasma frequency .",
    "in this section we will derive an effective action from the lagrangian ( [ eq:1 - 7 ] ) . by using the functional integral method,@xcite",

    "the ta escape rate well above the crossover temperature @xmath62 is given by@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the quantum mechanical enhancement factor resulting form stable fluctuation modes , @xmath65 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath66 is the fourier transform of the memory - friction kernel . the potential barrier height is not changed even in the presence of the lc circuit , so @xmath67 .",
    "thus the coupling to the lc circuit modifies only the prefactor of @xmath68 .    for the non - adiabatic ( @xmath69 ) cases which can be applicable to actual experiment,@xcite the quantum enhancement factor @xmath64 ( [ eq:4 - 2 ] )",

    "6 we will numerically compare theoretical results with experimental data in the ta regime .",
    "the mqt escape rate at zero temperature@xcite is given by @xmath73 by use of the bounce techniques , the mqt escape rate @xmath74 is perturbatively determined by @xmath75 where @xmath76/\\hbar=36 v_0^\\mathrm{1d } / 5 \\hbar \\omega_p$ ] and @xmath77/\\hbar$ ] are the bounce exponents , that are the value of the actions evaluated along the bounce trajectory @xmath78 . in the zero temperature and the non - adiabatic limit , the bounce action @xmath79 $ ]",

    "\\label{eq:5 - 7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the total bounce exponent is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the retardation correction to the mass @xmath83 .",
    "thus , due to the two - dimensional nature of the phase dynamics , the bounce exponent is increased with compared to one - dimensional cases .    by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 - 8 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 - 5 ] ) , we finally get the zero - temperature mqt escape rate as @xmath84   .",
    "\\label{eq:5 - 10 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the coupling to the lc circuit effectively increases the barrier potential , @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast to the ta escape rate , the coupling to the lc circuit gives rise to reduce the mqt escape rate @xmath74 considerably .",
    "therefore the two - dimensional nature has large influence on the mqt escape process at the low temperature regime .",
    "in order to check the validity of the extended circuit model@xcite for the ta and mqt escape process , we try to compare our result with the experimental data@xcite of the switching current distribution at the high - temperature ta and the low temperature mqt regimes . in these estimation",

    "dependence of the full width at half maximum @xmath95 of the switching current distribution @xmath91 .",
    "both the one- ( dotted black ) and two - dimensional model ( blue solid ) give almost same result above the crossover temperature .",
    "the calculated @xmath95 at @xmath96 k from the zero - temperature escape rate is shown by dashed - dotted ( red ) line .",
    "experimental data of @xmath95 ( black circles ) for a ybco bi - epitaxial josephson junction is also plotted .",
    ", width=453 ]    [ fig:5 ]    firstly we will investigate the ta regime . in fig .",
    "2 we show the temperature dependence of @xmath95 in the ta escape regime ( blue solid and black dotted lines ) .",
    "both the one- and two - dimensional model give good agreement with the experimental data ( black circles ) well above the crossover temperature ( @xmath97 k ) .",
    "therefore , in the ta regime , the system can be served as an one - dimensional model without the lc circuit .    in the mqt regime",
    ", the measured saturated - value of @xmath95 is found to be 11.9 na.@xcite in order to numerically calculate @xmath95 , we need the information about @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the values of @xmath87 @xmath88a , @xmath89 nh and @xmath90 pf have been directly determined from the experiments.@xcite therefore the only fitting parameter is @xmath99 . from the numerical estimation of @xmath95",
    ", we found that @xmath100 pf gives good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath95 .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath99 is consistent with the estimated value @xmath101 pf based on the geometry of the junction.@xcite therefore , we can conclude that the extended circuit model can quantitatively explain the mqt experiment@xcite in the ybco bi - epitaxial junction .",
    "in the present work , the ta and the mqt escape process of the ybco josephson junction coupled to the lc circuit has been analyzed by taking into account the two - dimensional nature of the phase dynamics . based on the feynman - vernon approach , the effective one - dimensional effective action is derived by integrating out the degree of freedom for the lc circuit .",
    "we found that the coupling to the lc circuit gives negligible reduction for ta escape rate . on the other hand",
    ", we also found that the mqt escape rate is considerably reduced due to the coupling between the junction and the lc circuit .",
    "these results are consistent with experimental result of a ybco bi - epitaxial josephson junction.@xcite in our model , we have assumed that the josephson current - phase relation is given by @xmath102 .",
    "therefore our theory can also be applicable to low-@xmath3 josephson junctions coupled to the artificial lc circuit .",
    "we expect that our prediction will be confirmed by use of not only high-@xmath3 but also the low-@xmath3 junctions experimentally .",
