    "in this section we show how a periodic decoration of graphene by adatoms modifies the electronic structure . here",
    "we considered h , f , o and mn adatoms , which are adsorbed at different sites and form a ( 4x4 ) supercells on graphene host matrix as shown in fig.[f2](a)-(d ) .",
    "we did not consider the interstitial or substitutional decoration , since experimental studies treating various foreign atoms , such as n@xcite , o@xcite , h@xcite , f@xcite , c@xcite , co@xcite , fe and gd@xcite , au and pt@xcite , revealed that these atoms prefer to be adsorbed at various sites on the surface of graphene , but none of them is adsorbed at the interstitial sites , nor is substituted for carbon atom .",
    "owing to the unpaired electron , a single hydrogen adatom adsorbed to the ( 4x4 ) supercell has a spin polarized , semiconducting ground state with a net magnetic moment of @xmath19=1 @xmath20 . upon the adsorption of a hydrogen atom band structure of graphene changes dramatically . instead of linear crossing of @xmath0 and @xmath21-bands at fermi level ,",
    "dispersionless impurity bands occurs with 0.1 ev indirect band gap .",
    "similar to hydrogen atom , the most favorable adsorption site for a f atom on graphene is the top site of carbon atoms . upon the adsorption of a f atom , @xmath22 bondings of three c - c bonds below f atom",
    "are dehybridized and form tetrahedrally coordinated four @xmath23 type bondings .",
    "differing from the decoration of h adatom , ground state is nonmagnetic and as a result of odd number of electrons f decorated graphene becomes metalized as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) .",

    "underlying c atoms become buckled by 0.36  .",

    "f2](c ) ) .",
    "valence and conduction band edges occurs between the @xmath6- and @xmath2-points .",
    "the adatom at the bridge site breaks the six fold rotation symmetry and hence hinders the linear band crossing .",
    "the situation is different in the case of mn , which is adsorbed above the center of a hexagon in graphene matrix and induces negligible deformation .",
    "only six nearest c atoms raise slightly to higher ( 0.02  ) position relative to the plane .",
    "localized , non - bonding mn-@xmath24 orbitals form flat bands near the fermi level . on the other hand ,",
    "the sixfold rotation symmetry is maintained even after mn atom adsorbed at the hollow site above the center of hexagon .",
    "accordingly , the metallic structure with a net magnetic moment of 3 @xmath25 per cell allows linear crossing of graphene bands at the @xmath6-points in fig . [ f2](d ) .",

    "[ f2](e ) we show electronic band structure corresponding to relatively denser hydrogen coverage ( c : h@xmath268 ) .",
    "such a nanomesh created by one - sided decoration of four hydrogen atoms in the ( 4x4 ) supercell gives rise to a relatively dispersive bands and a net magnetic moment of 4 @xmath20 per supercell .",
    "since the six fold rotation symmetry of graphene is broken by adsorbed h atoms , linear crossing of bands do not occur . in a decoration involving two sides of graphene , where two adjacent c atoms of different sublattices are saturated from different sides as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ( f ) .",
    "since an equal number of a- and b - sublattice atoms are saturated , the structure is nonmagnetic semiconductor with a band gap of 0.8 ev .",
    "another pattern derived from a graphane like domain consisting of 8 h atoms in fig .",
    "[ f2](g ) results in a band gap of 0.7 ev at @xmath2-point , but larger gap of 1 ev at the @xmath6-point .",
    "this nanomesh presents an electronic structure rather different both from graphene and graphane .",
    "the electronic structure is , however , different for a pattern of six h atoms , which saturate six carbon atoms at the corner a hexagon alternatingly from different sites ; namely three of them adsorbed to a - sublattice from one side , remaining three adsorbed to b - sublattice from the other side .",
    "even though sixfold rotation symmetry has changed to @xmath27 symmetry , both point group symmetries allow linear band crossing as seen in fig . [",
    "this case demonstrates the crucial role played by the intrinsic symmetry of the pattern in determining the electronic structure .",
    "@xcite    - and @xmath21-bands of graphene are shown by red / dashed lines.,width=321 ]    let us now take a closer look at the triangular patterns of adatom groups that have hexagonal symmetry . in fig .",

    "we also present an example of o@xmath32 pattern analogous to h@xmath33 decoration of ( 4x4 ) supercell ( c@xmath31h@xmath33 ) of graphene in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in this pattern",
    "three o atoms are bound alternatingly to bridge site at one site , the remaining three to other site .",
    "here it is seen that denser o patterns are not favored due to strong o - o repulsion .",
    "linear crossing of bands at @xmath6-point can also be achieved by o adatoms forming a periodically repeating o@xmath41 pattern .",
    "small band gap in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] can be closed if the supercell size is increased to hinder coupling between them .",
    "this example implies that the patterns similar to that done by using h atoms can be created by the passivation of @xmath42-orbital electrons with o atoms . in the case of fluorination of ( 4x4 ) graphene by f@xmath32 decoration , similar to h@xmath41 , linear @xmath0 and @xmath21-bands gets closer with very small ( 0.01 ev ) band gap at @xmath6-point .",
    "finally , the isosurface charge densities of these linearly crossing bands near @xmath6-point indicates that they mainly originate from graphene @xmath0-orbitals with small mixing from the adatom ( see fig .",

    "similar to adatom patterns on graphene , nanomeshes generated from the holes periodically patterned on graphene matrix exhibit also interesting features .",

    "after the creation of a c@xmath46 defect ( i.e. single c vacancy ) , jahn - teller type distortion changes the positions of surrounding c atoms slightly .",
    "the resulting structure attains a net magnetic moment of 1 @xmath25 .",
    "the origin of magnetism in defected graphene sheets and the character of electronic states induced by the vacancy resulting in flat bands around fermi level have been investigated by some recent studies.@xcite upon the removal of c atoms ( @xmath44>1 ) graphene is reconstructed to result in a significant modification in atomic configuration around the hole .",
    "for example , after the relaxation of atomic structure , c@xmath47 defected region becomes an octagon - shaped hole surrounded by 2 pentagons and 6 hexagons .",

    "is surrounded by pentagonal and hexagonal rings of c atoms to keep the flatness of the sheet .",
    "while the honeycomb lattice symmetry of the graphene matrix does not change considerably for larger defects c@xmath32 and c@xmath49 , hole region of c@xmath33 takes almost a circular shape surrounded by regular pentagons and hexagons .",

    "while nanomesh of c@xmath46 defect have metallic behavior , periodic structure of c@xmath47 defect becomes indirect band gap semiconductor of 0.65 ev .",

    "c@xmath48 defected gnm has metallic behavior .",

    "we note that the defect induced flat electronic bands around the fermi level occur if the electron spins become unpaired . on the other hand , the reconstruction or the dimerization of",
    "carbon dangling bonds around the defect can cause the flat bands in the gap to disappear .",
    "interestingly , nanomeshes of c@xmath41 and c@xmath49 holes , which are metallic , become semimetal upon the saturation of dangling bonds of carbon atoms around the hole by hydrogen atoms .",
    "this metal - semimetal transformation can have applications in graphene - based nanoelectronics . on the other hand , gnm of c@xmath41",

    "the analysis of the orbital character of linearly crossing @xmath0- and @xmath21-bands near @xmath6-point using isosurface charge densities suggests that these bands originate from bonding and antibonding combinations of @xmath0- orbitals at the neck and around c@xmath41 hole .",

    "this variation of band gaps is reminiscent of the family behavior of graphene nanoribbons and is related to the variation of the thickness of necks between periodically repeating c@xmath33 holes.@xcite here , even if the six fold rotation symmetry is conserved , the band gap opens for every @xmath44=3x@xmath53 with @xmath53 being an integer @xmath54 .",
