    "our strategy is to combine first - principles calculations with asd simulations . in practice , we map an itinerant electron system onto an effective hamiltonian with classical spins , @xmath0 this generalized hamiltonian consists of an exchange term :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are atomic indices , @xmath4 is the classical atomic moment and @xmath5 is the strength of the exchange interaction , and a spin - orbit interaction term :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the strength of the anisotropy field along the direction @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the dzyaloshiskii - moriya ( dm ) vector .",
    "@xcite these represent the main relativistic effects present in low - dimensional magnets , although the magnitude of the dm term is often negligibly small .",
    "the asd simulations rely on an accurate determination of the exchange integrals and spin - orbit coupling present in the generalized hamiltonian . in order to determine these , we employed two different methodes for our first principles calculations .",
    "first , we set up a slab with 9 - 11 layers representing the substrate , having on one side the magnetic over - layer and a large region of vacuum , simulating the surface .",
    "the interlayer distances were relaxed according to the forces using the projector augmented wave method ( paw ) as implemented in the vasp program  @xcite . once the relaxed geometry is established , we employed the spr - kkr package  @xcite for calculations of the parameters to be used within the generalized hamiltonian using the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the basis set consist of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals and all relativistic effects are included by solving the dirac equation .",
    "for the selfconsistent calculation we employed between 4 - 500 k - points in the two dimensional brilloiun zone , while a much more dense k - point grid of 2000 k - points were used in the calculation of exchange parameters and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , sufficient to obtain a convergence on a micro rydberg level for these parameters .",
    "the exchange parameters @xmath5 and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) vectors @xmath9 are obtained from the relativistic generalization  @xcite of the real - space method of infinitesimal rotations of liechtenstein , katsnelson and gubanov ( lkg )  @xcite with the ferromagnetic configuration chosen as the reference state for mapping . here , the full exchange tensor @xmath14 is calculated which can be decomposed into its isotropic part @xmath5 and its anti - symmetric part , which correponds to the dm - vector .",
    "the whole procedure relies on an adiabatic approximation in which the slow motion of the spins is decoupled from the fast motion of the itinerant electrons , a situation that is justified at low energy scales and for systems with reasonably large exchange splitting .",
    "once calculated , the exchange parameters @xmath5 may be fourier transformed to obtain the so - called adiabatic magnon spectrum . in the simple case of a single layer ( corresponding to one atom per cell ) ,",
    "the energy of a spin wave with respect to a ferromagnetic ground state is given by    @xmath15,\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the relative position vector connecting sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 . from this",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the spin wave dispersion @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite for systems with more than one atom per cell , as is the case for thin films consisting of more than one monolayer , the spin wave energies are given by the eigenvalues of the general @xmath18 matrix here expressed in block form @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the number of atoms per cell ( _ i.e. _ in this case the number of monolayers ) .",
    "using in the asd simulations the generalized hamiltonian @xmath21 as a starting point , the effective interaction field experienced by each atomic moment @xmath4 is given by @xmath22    the temporal evolution of the atomic spins at finite temperature is governed by langevin dynamics , through coupled stochastic differential equations , the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equations , written here in the landau - lifshitz form ,    @xmath23 - \\gamma\\frac{\\alpha}{m ( 1+\\alpha ^2 ) } \\mathbf{m}_i \\times \\left\\ { \\mathbf{m}_i \\times\\left[\\mathbf{b}_i + \\mathbf{b}_i(t)\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eqn : llg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "temperature fluctuations are included via a stochastic gaussian shaped magnetic field @xmath25 with properties @xmath26 and    @xmath27    where @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 denote lattice sites , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the carteisian components and @xmath30 is the gilbert damping parameter which eventually brings the system to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it should be noted that the simulations carried out in this work are for atomistic spins .",
    "hence the gyromagnetic factor in this simulations is simply the ratio between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum of an atom .",
    "an anisotropy in the gyromagnetic factor , with respect to the orientation of the atomic spin , would appear in the first principles part of our calculation , where the spin and orbital magnetic moments are calculated .",
    "it is known that this effect is rather small for transition metals ( e.g. as reported by hjortstam _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and sthr  @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence on any possible anisotropy of the damping parameter is less known . however , for most of our calculations the thermal fluctuations do not force the moments to deviate too much from the easy magnetization axis , and hence a possible tensorial form of the damping parameter would not influence our results by a significant amount .",
    "the coupled equations of motion ( [ eqn : llg ] ) can be viewed as describing the precession of each spin about an effective interaction field , with complexity arising from the fact that , since all spins are moving , the effective field is not static . in our calculations",
    "we evolve the stochastic llg equations using a semi - implicit method introduced by mentink _",
    "et al_.  @xcite    the principal advantage of combining first - principles calculations with the asd approach is that it allows us to address the dynamical properties of spin systems at finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite we focus in particular on two important quantities , the space- and time - displaced correlation function : @xmath31    where the angular brackets signify an ensemble average and @xmath28 the cartesian component , and its fourier transform , the dynamical structure factor :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momentum and energy transfer , respectively .",
    "the dynamical structure factor , @xmath35 is the quantity probed in neutron scattering experiments of bulk systems  @xcite , and can analogously be applied to speels measurements . by plotting the peak positions of the structure factor along particular directions in reciprocal space",
    ", the spin wave dispersions may be obtained .",
    "as stated in the previous paragraphs , we use in our study of magnetic layers a combined first principles / asd strategy .",
    "this means that we first lead an _ ab initio _ investigation of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of all the systems under consideration . in the following , we shall state for all the studied systems the layer - resolved magnetic moments and the values of the exchange parameters",
    "the exchange interactions have been calculated for a distance equal to three times the lattice parameter for each system . in tables  [ tablefe ] and [ tableco ] only the highest values of the exchange parameters are presented , namely the inter- and intra - layer nearest neighbours interactions .",
    ".exchange parameters and magnetic moments as calculated from first principles , for the fe multilayers systems .",
    "all the exchange interactions up to a distance of three lattice parameters have been calculated and included in simulations . for clarity",
    ", we list only the dominant inter- and intra - layer interactions in the table ( all the other exchange paramters values can be found in appendix  [ app ] ) .",

    "we obtain a qualitatively good agreement with experiment but the amplitude of the calculated spin wave asymmetry is slightly overestimated ( @xmath36 compared to @xmath37 in experiment ) .",
    "there are several explanations to this discrepency , primarily the asymmetry is sensitive to the value of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction which is very delicate to calculate from ab - initio theory .",
    "the assumption made in the calculations of an atomically sharp interface between fe and w may also be a limiting factor .",

    "( [ eq : susc ] ) the acoustic term will dominate and will be detected in experiment .",
    "if we go outside the first bz , it is possible to have a situation where the optical term dominates , on the expense of the acoustic response , for instance by choosing @xmath51 $ ] , as illustrated in fig .",

    "if there are more than two atoms in the unit cell , the analysis becomes more complicated but the principle is the same .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that combining first principles calculations with atomistic spin dynamics simulations provides a powerful tool for studies of magnetic excitations in low dimensional systems .",
    "it is hoped that the remarkable progress using the speels technique  @xcite will continue to provide new and surprising experimental results , for which the currently presented theory seems to be a good tool for analyzing the experimental data and predicting magnon spectra and related properties .",
    "the materials presented here have several common features , e.g. the absence of optical modes in the magnon curves , both as determined by experiments as well as obtained by theory .",
    "this fact has been analyzed in detail and it is argued that also the optical modes should be visible if one considers excitations which allow for momentum transfer outside the first brillouin zone .",
    "the realization of this in the speels method is clearly a challenge .",
    "in addition , we show that all thin film systems investigated here have a spin wave stiffness which is considerably softer compared to the bulk value .",
    "this applies both to fe as well as co films .",
    "finally , we report on a quantitative agreement between theory and measured magnon curves for 2 ml fe on w(110 ) and 8 ml co on cu(001 ) .",
    "in addition to the _ ab initio _ calculated values for the magnetic moments and anisotropy energies included in section  [ abinitio ] , we present here in detail the values of the exchange interaction divided into intra- and inter - layer contributions .",
