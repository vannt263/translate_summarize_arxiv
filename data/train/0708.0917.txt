    "photons of energies around 2  mev have a high probability to interact in germanium through compton scattering .",
    "the mean free path of the process is a couple of centimeters . if a photon compton scatters only once inside a germanium detector , the recoiling electron deposits its energy most likely within a 1  mm range , resulting in a so - called single - site event ( sse ) .",
    "if , in contrast , a photon interacts through pair production or scatters multiple times , energy can be deposited at different locations separated by typically a few centimeters , resulting in a so - called multi - site event ( mse ) .",
    "the charge carriers created by the energy deposition in the germanium detector drift towards the anode and cathode of the detector . while the charge amplitude of the induced pulse is determined by the number of carriers ( thus by the energy deposited ) , the pulse shape is determined by the location(s ) of the energy deposition(s ) and thus the charge drifting times .",
    "mses are expected to have more involved pulse shapes than sses , and thus , pulse shape analysis ( psa ) can be used to separate the two classes of events  @xcite .",
    "one application of psa is the background rejection in experiments searching for neutrinoless double - beta decay ( 0@xmath2@xmath3 ) in @xmath1ge - enriched detectors , such as the gerda experiment  @xcite .",
    "the expected 0@xmath2@xmath3 signal events have two electrons in the final state with a total energy of 2.039  mev . these are mostly sses .",
    "a large fraction of the expected background events are induced by external photons with energy depositions around the q - value .",
    "these events are expected to be predominantly mses which can be rejected by psa .    in order to study and improve the performance of psa , sse- and mse - dominant data samples have to be collected independently of the pulse shape . in this paper",
    "a method to collect single compton scattering events ( scs ) as an sse - dominant sample is investigated in more detail .",
    "the energy of the scattered photon in an scs event can be calculated given the incoming photon energy and the scattering angle .",
    "therefore , scs events can be collected by positioning a second germanium detector at a specific angle with respect to the first detector and using it to tag escaped photons with the correct energy  @xcite .",
    "if the incoming photon has an energy of 2.614  mev as emmitted by a @xmath5tl source , a photon compton scattered at 72@xmath6 has an energy of 575  kev .",
    "this signature is used to tag the single recoiling electron inside the first germanium detector .",
    "the energy in the event is equal to the germanium 0@xmath2@xmath3 q - value .",
    "the location of the energy deposition of the electron within the detector volume is controlled by positioning the source and the second detector correspondingly .",
    "another common method to collect an sse - dominant sample is to select the double - escape events ( dep )  @xcite .",
    "the incoming photon interacts with the germanium detector through pair production and the two 511  kev photons from the positron annihilation escape the detector without further interaction .",
    "the electron and positron mostly deposit their energies very locally and result in an sse .",
    "another useful sample contains so - called single - escape events ( sep ) where only one 511  kev photon escapes .",
    "the other photon mostly deposits its energy at locations different from those of the electron and positron .",
    "thus , sep events provide an mse - dominant sample with energy deposition close to the 0@xmath2@xmath3 q - value .    however , the dep events are not a perfect test sample for the expected 0@xmath2@xmath3 events . if the two photons escape the detector , the interaction point is more likely close to the detector surface as compared to scs events .",
    "0@xmath2@xmath3 events , on the other hand , are distributed evenly within the detector volume .",
    "in addition , dep and 0@xmath2@xmath3 events have different energies . a dep event induced by a 2.6  mev photon from a @xmath5tl source",
    "has an energy of 1.59  mev , quite different from the 0@xmath2@xmath3 q - value . in these respects studies with scs samples",
    "suffer less from systematic effects .",
    "the experimental setup and the data collection are described in chapter  [ chapter : experiment ] . the monte carlo simulation is also included in this chapter .",
    "it is used to verify that the collected scs samples are sse - dominated . in chapter  [ chapter : psa ] a psa package based on an artificial neural network ( ann ) is presented .",
    "the training methods are described and the results given .",
    "the experimental setup is illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] .    .",
    "the dotted lines illustrate the segment boundaries . ]",
    "the segmented germanium detector under study is a prototype detector for phase - ii of the gerda experiment  @xcite .",
    "the true coaxial 18-fold segmented @xmath7-type hpge dectector has a weight of 1.63  kg and the dimensions are 69.8  mm height and 75.0  mm diameter ; the inner hole has a diameter of 10.0  mm .",
    "the segmentation scheme is 3-fold along the vertical axis and 6-fold in the azimuthal angle .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "signals from the 18 segments and the core of the detector are amplified by charge sensitive pre - amplifiers and read out by a pixie4 daq system  @xcite with 14-bit adc s at a sampling rate of 75  mhz . the resolution ( fwhm ) of the core",
    "is @xmath43.5  kev at 1.3  mev and those of the segments are between 2.5 and 4.0  kev .",
    "a time resolution of roughly 10  ns can be achieved with the sampling rate used .",
    "this corresponds to a position resolution of @xmath41  mm inside the detector volume.1  cm per 100  ns . ]",
    "more information about the segmented detector and the daq system can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a 100  kbq @xmath8th source is positioned at a distance of 23@xmath91  cm from the center of the segmented detector and faces the center point of segment 14 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] . a second non - segmented and well - type germanium detector , a canberra reversed germanium detector ( rege )  @xcite , is positioned at the same height with the closed end facing the segmented germanium detector .",
    "the distance from the closed end surface to the center of the segmented detector is 23@xmath91  cm .",

    "it has a resolution ( fwhm ) of 2.3  kev at 1.3  mev .",
    "it is used to tag the photons scattered mostly in segment  14 .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the rege  detector results in recorded scs events with scattering angles between @xmath4  65@xmath6 and @xmath4  80@xmath6 corresponding to energy depositions in the segmented detector between @xmath4  1940  kev and @xmath4  2110  kev .",
    "the precision of the alignment of the rege detector with respect to the @xmath8th source and the segmented detector is @xmath4  5@xmath6 .",
    "the energy thresholds for all channels are set to 100  kev .",
    "a coincidence trigger is required between the core of the segmented detector and the rege with a coincident time window of 500  ns . due to a technical limitation of the coincidence trigger of the daq system ,",
    "only four channels could be read out .",
    "thus , for each coincidence trigger , only the energies of the core ( @xmath10 ) , segment 14 ( @xmath11 ) , segment 17 ( @xmath12 ) ( below segment 14 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] ) and the rege ( @xmath13 ) were recorded .",
    "300 time samples were taken for each pulse for all 4 channels .",
    "this corresponds to a time window of 4  @xmath14s including 1  @xmath14s before the arrival of the trigger . in this analysis ,",
    "however , only the core pulses are used for the psa .",
    "the actual coincidence trigger rate was @xmath4  12  hz . the independent trigger rates of the segmented detector and of the rege detector were both @xmath42000  hz .",
    "this results in an accidental coincidence rate of @xmath42  hz .",
    "the coincidence trigger rate without the @xmath8th source is @xmath150.1  hz .",
    "therefore , without further cuts , @xmath4  20% of all events are expected to originate from accidental coincidences .",
    "however , the fraction of accidental coincidence events among the selected scs events is negligible , as discussed in the next section .      in total 360  000 coincident events",
    "were collected .",

    "the geometrical acceptance for scs  events extends to 2110  kev , but sep  events would contaminate the sample , as they have a core energy of @xmath10  =  2103.5  kev in this setup .",
    "they are excluded by removing events with the core energy of the segmented detector above  2090  kev .",

    "the fraction of sse events in the collected scs sample can be increased by further improving the tagging method .",
    "for example , the whole experimental setup can be shielded from external photons and collimators can be positioned between the two detectors .",
