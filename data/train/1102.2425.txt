    "the application of a temperature difference @xmath2 across a solid conductor causes mobile charge carriers to diffuse from hot to cold regions , giving rise to a thermoelectric voltage @xmath3 .",

    "this property enables the conversion of heat to electricity . in ordinary metals like copper , @xmath4 is of the order of 10  @xmath5v / k . in the mid 20@xmath6 century",
    "much higher seebeck coefficients of a few hundreds of @xmath5v / k were obtained in low - gap semi - conductors , and those materials are still the object of intense research activities , with the perspective of converting low - grade wasted heat into electric energy.@xcite semiconductors have reached their limit from a material perspective.@xcite research is now focussed on improving their performance by nanostructuring existing materials , and this represents a substantial production cost.@xcite    thermoelectric effects also occur in liquid electrolytes , as first observed towards the end of the 19@xmath6 century .",
    "electrolytes are characterised by the presence of several ion species .",
    "a temperature gradient induces gradients in the concentrations of different ionic species .",
    "this is known as the soret effect,@xcite which couples to a seebeck effect in conducting fluids .",
    "the possibility of converting heat into electricity has also been studied in thermogalvanic cells using two identical electrodes at different temperatures , where chemical reactions take place.@xcite thermogalvanic cells use electrolytes having large seebeck coefficients ( of the order of 1  mv / k in aqueous potassium ferrocyanide / ferricyanide solutions).@xcite    however the efficiency of the thermal to electrical energy conversion is not governed solely by a material s seebeck coefficient .",
    "rather it is measured by a dimensionless number , the `` figure of merit '' @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the temperature , and ( @xmath8 ) represents the ratio of the electrical to the thermal conductivity .",
    "although thermogalvanic cells have a high seebeck coefficient their relatively low electrical conductivity reduces their figure of merit by two orders of magnitude with respect to that of solid - state thermoelectric devices using low - gap semiconductors.@xcite    concerning thermocells , the investigations have been mainly restricted to aqueous solutions of inorganic ions . extending this field of research to organic electrochemistry , using organic macroions in non - aqueous solutions , ionic liquids etc ... , offers a quasi - infinite number of combinations .",
    "we show that solutions of tetraalkylammonium ions in organic solvents ( octanol , dodecanol , ethylene - glycol , ... ) reach unprecedented large seebeck coefficients of the order of 10  mv / k .",
    "this result opens the perspective of engineering electrolytes with huge seebeck coefficients .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is closely related to the structural entropy induced by the interactions between ions and solvent .",
    "this has been thoroughly studied in water solutions@xcite and in a lesser extend in non - aqueous solvents.@xcite there is a pure electrostatic contribution to this entropy coming from the interaction of the ion charge with the electric dipoles of the solvent considered as a homogeneous dielectric medium .",
    "this contribution is generally evaluated through the simple born model.@xcite there are also more subtle effects coming from the modification of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity ( first , second solvation shells and beyond ... ) of the ions which can increase ( kosmotrope effect ) or destroy ( chaotrope effect ) the local order of the surrounding solvent molecules .",
    "the ions are named _ structure makers _ in the first case and _ structure breakers _ in the second .",
    "we show that the pure electrostatic contribution to the transported entropy ( born model ) is small and conjecture that the observed seebeck coefficient arises mainly from kosmotrope effects created by tetraalkylammonium ions on the local structure of alcohols .",
