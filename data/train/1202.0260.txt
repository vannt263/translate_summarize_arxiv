    "the most dramatic examples of high - energy emission from galaxies are found in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where particle acceleration occurs in jets powered by supermassive black holes . in such systems",
    "non - thermal emission is often seen across the whole electromagnetic spectrum ( in systems where the jets are aligned with the line - of - sight to the observer  commonly known as blazars ) . in the more common case that jets are not aligned to the observer ,",
    "non - thermal dominance occurs only in the radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray domains .",
    "the high - energy emission of these objects has been discussed by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite for a compilation of vhe @xmath0-ray blazars ) , here we focus on the less dramatic , but potentially very importent non - thermal emission of `` inactive '' galaxies , where the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is dominated by stellar processes",
    ".    in the milky way ( mw ) , we know that the population of ultra - relativistic particles , known as cosmic rays ( crs ) , plays an important dynamical role ; being close to pressure equilibrium with thermal gas and magnetic fields in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "our knowledge of this population has in the past come largely from direct ( local ) measurements and from radio - synchrotron emission from the energetically less important relativistic electrons , rather than the nuclei that make up 99% of the crs .",
    "the process of star formation ( sf ) , particularly of massive stars , is now known to lead to astrophysical particle acceleration , and hence @xmath0-ray emission , via a number of different objects and phenomena .",
    "the well - established accelerators are associated with the end - products of the massive - stellar lifecycle : supernova remnants ( snr ) and pulsars and their associated pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) . over the last two decades , measurements in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray domains",
    "have shown that snrs are efficient particle accelerators ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with increasing evidence for the acceleration of nuclei as well as electrons ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "less secure are the apparent association of @xmath0-ray emission with colliding stellar winds in binary systems ( @xcite ) and the collective effect of winds in clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the dominant contributor to the cr population , the expectation from our own galaxy is that all massive star - forming regions should be associated with particle acceleration and hence @xmath0-ray emission , at some level .",
    "indeed , recent progress in the field of high - energy ( he ) and very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray astronomy , driven by the satellite - borne instrument _",
    "fermi_-lat and ground - based vhe telescopes such as h.e.s.s .  and",
    "veritas , has led to the identification of a growing population of high - energy - emitting star - forming galaxies ( including the nearby starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 ) .",
    "we focus on these new developments below , discussing in particular the case of starburst galaxies , and finally discuss the prospects for the next - generation @xmath0-ray mission cta .",
    "ultra - relativistic electrons and nuclei suffer energy losses by a number of different mechanisms , which lead to the production of photons from the radio to vhe @xmath0-ray regime . here",
    "we consider the primary energy - loss mechanisms in turn , giving example loss - timescales appropriate for the environment in starburst regions .",
    "cr nuclei predominantly lose energy in strong nuclear interactions with ambient matter , producing @xmath1-decay @xmath0-ray emission primarily above a few hundred mev . for a typical starburst region",
    "the ( fairly energy - independent ) interaction timescale is @xmath2 years , where @xmath3 is the average ambient density in hydrogen atoms per @xmath4 , with an average energy loss of @xmath550% per collision . for electrons",
    "a number of different energy - loss mechanisms play a significant role . for the highest energy electrons synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic )",
    "emission dominate with energy loss timescales ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 years and @xmath8 years , for a starburst - like environment with an average magnetic field strength of @xmath9 g , and a radiation field energy density of @xmath10ev@xmath11 . at electron energies below a few gev bremsstrahlung and ( at the lowest energies )",
    "coulomb losses become increasingly important , impacting on the shape of the equilibrium ( i.e. cooled ) electron spectrum and hence the spectrum of the non - thermal emission ( see figure [ fig1 ] and section 4 for more details ) .",
    "in such an environment a 1tev electron will produce ic and synchrotron photons with typical energies of @xmath12gev ( for black - body target photons with @xmath13k ) and @xmath14kev , respectively .",
    "these timescales are so short that it is often very difficult for high energy electrons to escape from star - forming regions .",
    "nuclei , in contrast may be removed by diffusion or bulk motion before significant energy losses occur .",
    "starburst galaxies often drive winds which carry away particles from the nuclear region into the inter - galactic medium .",
    "this advection of particles is determined by the wind speed and its scale height , and can be characterised by an average residence time of the particles in the nucleus  which is around @xmath15 years for the @xmath16kms@xmath17 starburst wind of ngc253 .",
    "more details on energy loss and @xmath0-ray production mechanisms in general can be found in @xcite . for more details on the environment and high - energy emission of starbursts",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "the presence of high - energy electrons in the archetypal starburst galaxies ngc253 and m82 was identified through low - frequency radio - synchrotron emission measurements in the late 1970 s ( e.g. @xcite and early 1980 s ( e.g. @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray emission from these two objects has only recently been reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both galaxies have also been detected in the he domain using data obtained in observations with the lat instrument onboard the _ fermi _ satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "both starbursts are right at the sensitivity limit of _ fermi_-lat and ground - based vhe @xmath0-ray instruments  their detection required very long exposure times and they comprise the weakest @xmath0-ray source class detected so far . within large errors , the he and vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum of m82 can be described by a single power - law in energy with photon index @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the extrapolated he @xmath0-ray spectrum of ngc253 ( @xmath18 ) is consistent with the integrated vhe @xmath0-ray flux reported by h.e.s.s . in the following",
    ", we will outline the importance of different energy - loss processes of nuclei and electrons in a typical starburst environment as discussed in section  [ sec : losses ] and illustrate the effect on the sed of changing key parameters of the system with a very simple model .",
    "-decay ( black ) in a single - zone , time - dependent model for the continuous injection of electrons and protons over @xmath15yr . for the solid lines ( model 1 ) , a magnetic field strength of @xmath19 g",
    ", a radiation field energy density of @xmath20ev of a black - body with temperature 50k , and an average density n@xmath21 of 250 particles per @xmath4 are assumed .",
    "the energy input is @xmath22ergs@xmath17 for electrons and an order of magnitude higher for protons .",
    "an injection spectrum index of @xmath23 and maximum accelerated particle energy of @xmath24tev are used for this model .",
    "dashed lines ( model 2 ) illustrate the effect of reducing @xmath25 by a factor of 10 and doubling the magnetic field strength .",
    "a proton spectral index of 2.3 is used in this second case . ]",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a illustrative model sed for the particle injection and cooling in an environment similar to that found in the starburst nuclei of ngc253 and m82 .",
    "electrons and protons are injected over the assumed particle residence time of @xmath15 years . as this",
    "timescale is longer than the cooling timescales for electrons in the system , this sed is representative of the system at equilibrium ( i.e. the present day sed  given the typical starburst lifetime of @xmath26 years ) , provided that the escape probability is energy - independent .",
    "the ic , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission for electrons is shown for `` typical '' and `` extreme '' values of the radiation field energy density and magnetic field strength . for model  1 a comparatively low @xmath27-field strength of 100@xmath28 g and rather high radiation field density of 2500ev@xmath11",
    "are assumed . in this model",
    "a high - energy upturn in the synchrotron spectrum can be seen  a consequence of ic - dominated cooling in the klein - nishina regime . in model  2 the magnetic field strength",
    "is assumed to be @xmath29@xmath28 g and @xmath30ev@xmath11 , and synchrotron losses always dominate over ic .",
    "the energy input of @xmath31ergs@xmath17 for protons ( electrons ) represents an electron - to - proton ratio of 1/10 and has been derived assuming one supernova explosion every decade and a particle acceleration efficiency of 10% .",
    "as the electron - to - proton ratio at injection in our own galaxy is likely @xmath51/100 , this sed illustrates that @xmath32-decay @xmath0-rays are very likely to dominate the sed at gev energies . for electrons with energies much smaller than @xmath33gev ,",
    "coulomb cooling starts to become significant and results in a hardening of the radio spectrum in the 100mhz to 1ghz frequency range .",
    "these qualitative results should be compared to the more sophisticated modelling of non - thermal emission of starbursts in ( for example ) @xcite or @xcite .",
    "now that @xmath0-ray emission from external star - forming galaxies has been established , we have the opportunity for the first time to compare the high - energy emission of the mw to other systems and test our ideas on relativistic particle production and transport . as a very nearby starburst with well - established radio , gev and tev emission ,",
    "ngc253 is well suited to such a comparison .",
    "the synchrotron emission from starburst galaxies is in general correlated to their far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and hence star - formation rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio emission of ngc253 is coincident with the @xmath50.5  kpc central molecular zone ( cmz ) , which has a star - formation rate exceeding that of the entire mw .",
    "[ fig2 ] provides a multi - frequency view of ngc  253 on the scale of the galaxy as a whole and close to the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus exhibits bright infra - red and radio emission , and an outflow is apparent in thermal x - rays . in a recent co study",
    "@xcite found striking morphological similarities between the cmz of ngc253 and that of the mw ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the physical size of the cmz as a whole , and that of the prominent co peaks ( @xmath34pc ) , are remarkably similar in the two systems .",
    "although the molecular mass estimate is afflicted by a considerable error in the co - to - h@xmath35 conversion ratio , the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complexes in ngc253 have significantly higher co@xmath36 intensities , suggesting order of magnitude higher densities in ngc253 and a factor 10 higher total mass .",

    "also shown is the cmz of our galaxy as seen by bolocam , the vla and spitzer in the bottom right ( credit : a. ginsburg , john bally , f. yusef - zadeh , bolocam gps team ; glimpse ii team ) .",
    "the cmz of ngc253 and the milky way show striking similarities in @xmath39co@xmath36 line emission ( see text for more details ) .",
    "image reproduced from @xcite . ]",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarises sf and @xmath0-ray emission related quantities for the ngc253 starburst nucleus , for the mw cmz and for the mw as a whole",
    ". the sf rate of the mw and the cmz are inferred from number counts of young stellar objects and the application of a stellar evolution model .",
    "the supernova rate of the cmz has been estimated by a number of different methods including the fir - supernova rate relation , stellar composition models , and pulsar population studies ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . since the distance to ngc253 is much larger than to the centre of our galaxy , young stellar objects are too faint to be detected by current instruments , hence the sfr has to be inferred by indirect approaches such as the scaling relation between sfr and ir flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the supernova rate also has to be indirectly inferred , from e.g. iron - line measurements .",
    "the inferred sfr and supernova rate in the starburst nucleus of ngc253 are orders of magnitude larger than in the cmz .    under the assumption that particle acceleration predominantly occurs in snr shells , or is simply driven by massive star formation , and the particle acceleration efficiency ( @xmath40 )",
    "is fixed , the cr injection power should correlate with the supernova rate . for a fixed efficiency of @xmath0-ray production ( @xmath41 ) from accelerated particles ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux should therefore be proportional to the supernova rate .",
    "table  1 gives the ratio of the @xmath0-ray luminosity in the gev and tev bands to the supernova rate in the three systems considered .",
    "comparing the entire milky way with the ngc253 starburst , a factor of a few difference apparently exists in the product @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "a much more dramatic difference exists between the apparently much more similar regions of the ngc253 starburst and the cmz , with @xmath42@xmath41 smaller by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude with respect to ngc253 .",
    "this observation however , can be understood in the following picture : the convective escape time , i.e. the residence time of particles in both systems , is comparable if the cmz in the mw drives a nuclear wind , similar in terms of wind speed and size , to the one observed in ngc253 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the order of magnitude higher density in the ngc253 starburst region on the other hand , results in an order of magnitude higher fraction of energy lost by an average proton in p - p interactions .",
    "hence , the efficiency of converting cr energy into @xmath0  rays ( @xmath41 ) is expected to be an order of magnitude increased relative to the cmz in the mw .",
    "the upcoming cherenkov telescope array project ( @xcite ) represents a major step forward in both the sensitivity and precision of @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "compared to current instruments it will provide a broader energy coverage and overlap in energy with the _ fermi _ satellite , a much better angular resolution , and a factor of 10 better sensitivity .",
    "this will allow us to measure the spectra of m82 and ngc253 in great detail and to search for spectral features such as the emergence and subsequent disappearance of an ic component .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emission from the known starbursts originates from the gmc complex seen e.g. in co , it might be possible to detect a significant extension in the @xmath0-ray emission , given the arc - minute - scale angular resolution of cta .",
    "finally , the greatly improved sensitivity might allow us to detect other nearby galaxies such as andromeda ( m31 ) and/or to establish new source classes such as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , helping us to gain a deeper insight into the relationship between star formation and particle acceleration .",
