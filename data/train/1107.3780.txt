    "radiochromic films , such as gafchromic ebt and ebt 2 films@xcite , are a popular tool to measure dose depositions from ionizing radiation .",
    "most of the previously published studies@xcite have focused on the gafchromic ebt film , the predecessor of the ebt 2 film . however , the active layer of both types of films is the same , which results in comparable outcomes for the ebt and the ebt 2 film @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of these type of films are the fact that these films have the following properties :    [ [ section ] ]    a near flat response to different photon energies @xcite    [ [ section-1 ] ]    close to water equivalence ( z@xmath5=6.98 @xcite )    [ [ section-2 ] ]    a thickness less then 0.3mm@xcite    [ [ section-3 ] ]    a low perturbation of the irradiated media , which is certainly important for the evaluation of recent rotating treatment techniques like vmat@xcite    [ [ section-4 ] ]    a reasonably large dynamic range ( [ 0,10]gy@xcite , [ 0.1,8]gy@xcite )    [ [ section-5 ] ]    a high resolution ( 0.22@xmath6m@xcite )    disadvantages of the films are their non - uniformity and production stability , which has an impact on the choice between transmittance ( @xmath0 ) , and optical density ( @xmath7 ) , as dose dependent quantity ( section [ s_odort ] )",
    ".    however , the combination of the afore mentioned properties makes gafchromic ebt 2 film , further referred to as film , usable in almost every application in radiotherapy .",
    "for example , at the university hospital leuven the films are clinically used : for in - vivo measurements of total body and electron skin irradiations ; for volumetric modulated arc therapy quality assurance ; for internal audits of brachytherapy , and stereotactic treatments ; for the introduction of new treatment techniques@xcite , and new clinical trials ( flame trial@xcite ) .    additionally , there is a large range of research purposes such as ; out of field dosimetry @xcite , estimation of microscopic dose distributions in nano - particle enhanced radiation therapy@xcite , and the optimization of the dosimetry of fluoroscopic ct protocols .",
    "the wide use of these film requires a transparent and accessible absolute calibration protocol .",
    "the calibration methodology aims to use one or two uncut calibration films to represent a whole batch .",
    "the use of an uncut film avoids puzzling with calibration film fragments , and avoids sharp transmission and diffraction edges in the film scanner transmission system .",
    "calibration films and patient quality assurance ( qa ) films are always scanned successively , but they are not necessarily irradiated on the same day .",
    "an error propagation analysis of the calibration protocol is built using the small scale and the large scale variations in the film response .",
    "the calibration protocol is based on eight static fields irradiated on an uncut 8@xmath810 inch film , see figure [ f_calscheme ] .",

    "<S> * purpose : * to relate the physical transmittance parameters of the water equivalent gafchromic ebt 2 film with the delivered dose in a transparent absolute calibration protocol . the protocol should be easy to understand , easy to perform , and should be able to predict the residual dose error .    </S>",
    "<S> * methods : * the protocol uses at most two uncut calibration films for a whole batch . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration films are irradiated on different positions with static fields with varying dose levels .    </S>",
    "<S> the transmittance trough the film , @xmath0 , is preferred over the optical density . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical function is used to associate @xmath0 with the delivered dose based on physical characteristics of the film : the minimal and maximal @xmath0-values , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and a factor scaling the dose , @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dose uncertainty of the protocol is calculated using an error propagation analysis of the calibration curve . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis makes use of the small scale and the large scale variations in the film response ( local and global uniformity ) . before calibrating the film , </S>",
    "<S> the stability of unirradiated films is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the positions of the different dose levels is studied .    </S>",
    "<S> * results : * both a production and a spatial dependency of the unirradiated films was noticed . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial dependency required an avoidance of a quarter of the film . </S>",
    "<S> the transmittance is also affected by the storage and the transport conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the lowest residual errors and the highest significance for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 was achieved with arbitrary dose levels for different positions on the film . </S>",
    "<S> two calibration films give the better results . </S>",
    "<S> significant calibration curves were found for both the red and the green color channel .    </S>",
    "<S> large differences ( @xmath4gy ) between calibration curves , with different positions for the dose levels are seen .    in the [ 0.04,2.5]gy dose range the red channel calibration curve has dose errors ranging from -2.3% to 4.9% . for the green channel </S>",
    "<S> the error range is [ -3.6%,6.9% ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated error propagation was able to predict an upper limit for the red channel dose errors . </S>",
    "<S> for the green channel this prediction was not achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions : * the gafchromic ebt2 films are properly calibrated with an accessible robust calibration protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol largely deals with the uniformity problems of the film . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method allowed to relate the dose with the red channel transmittance using only @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and a dose scaling factor . based on the local and global uniformity the red channel dose errors could be predicted to be smaller than 5% . </S>"
