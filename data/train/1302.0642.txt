    "it was noted that this cancelation is possible by the existence of the @xmath1 whose mass scales as @xmath114 and cancels the gluonic effect in eq.([eq2 ] ) only when @xmath115 ; other meson masses have a smooth large @xmath108 limit .",
    "this constraint directly relates the @xmath1 mass to the low energy theorem .",
    "@xmath116 by using the @xmath0 anomaly , @xmath117 eq.([eq4 ] ) becomes as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath69 is the number of light flavors . in eq.([eq5 ] ) , we made use of @xmath119 to lowest order in @xmath108 .",
    "eq.([eq6 ] ) is the celebrated wv formula .    substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we find @xmath120 where we have used @xmath121 , @xmath122 and used @xmath123 for pure glue theory .",
    "this is smaller than the vacuum value of the @xmath124 mass as expected ; this is the part coming from the @xmath125 effect to the mass of @xmath124 .      to obtain the generalized formula at finite temperature ,",
    "one notes that the thermal gluonic effects are of order @xmath113 while that of the quarks are of order @xmath108 .",
    "if one is in the confined phase , the phase is composed of mesons , glueballs and baryons : the scattering of these states scale as order 1 , 1 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "hence as long as one assumes that the number of hadrons do not scale with @xmath108 , hadronic effects can be neglected .",
    "near the phase transition , the degeneracy of hadrons would increase and follow the scaling of gluons and quarks .",
    "therefore , the leading order effect would come from the gluons . taking into account the effect of the thermal gluons , the low energy theorem given in eq .",
    "( [ let-2 ] ) will be modified only by the effect of finite temperature .",
    "therefore , the generalization of the wv formula given in eq .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) does not change .",
    "naively , finite temperature effect will introduce the medium rest frame and break lorentz invariance ; this means that the correlation function is a separate function of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "however , the thermal correction we consider is embedded in the scalar gluon condensate and in the scalar low energy theorem .",
    "therefore , the corresponding change should also be only in the scalar quantity ; hence eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) should be valid for our purpose .",
    "first let us consider the denominator of eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "it has been known for a long time , that the gluon condensate has contribution from the perturbative and non - perturbative parts .",
    "moreover , it was also known that at the critical temperature , the non - perturbative contribution changes abruptly , but does not vanish completely , and retains more than half of its non - perturbative value  @xcite .",
    "the effect of subtracting out the second term in the denominator of eq.([eq16 ] ) is to get rid of the perturbative correction , or the seemingly scale breaking effect that is not related to scale breaking but due to the introduction of an external scale parameter @xmath129 .",
    "the leading perturbative correction to the gluon condensate is proportional to @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming that the temperature dependence is of the following form , @xmath131 we find , @xmath132 if the temperature dependence of @xmath133 is neglected .",
    "the only temperature dependence that survives is @xmath134 , whose scale dependence is coming from dimensional transmutation and not from the external temperature only .",
    "it is the non - perturbative part that dominates the behavior of the right hand side of eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as we discussed before , for the gluon condensate , one has to use the lattice result obtained in the pure - gauge theory calculation .",
    "the critical temperature in such a calculation @xmath135 260 mev is known to be around 100 mev larger than that from a full qcd calculation @xmath136@xcite . on the other hand , while the expected change of the gluon condensate is more abrupt in the pure - gauge calculation , the actual change in the condensate value itself at the critical temperature is found to be similar to the full calculation@xcite .",
    "this means that the change of the gluon condensate can be effectively neglected up to temperatures near @xmath136 .    finally , we use the fact that when chiral symmetry is restored , eq .  ( [ eq16 ] ) is zero for large @xmath107 as given by eq .",
    "( [ ps - chiral ] ) . hence",
    ", when chiral symmetry is restored , @xmath137 therefore , going back to eq.([eq16 ] ) and making use of the previous discussions , we find that when chiral symmetry is restored , @xmath138 in the chiral limit .",
    "one concludes that in the large @xmath108 limit of qcd , @xmath124 mass will become degenerate with the other goldstone bosons .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ; that the anomalous @xmath125 @xmath124 mass squared vanishes at high t as the chiral quark condensate @xmath139 .",
    "we have used euclidean path integral to show that the current density matrix of zero modes is responsible for the breaking of chiral symmetry in operators constructed from correlation functions .",
    "this is a generalization of the banks - casher formula to any order parameter . as for the @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "the contribution of topologically non trivial configurations determine the presence of its breaking effect .",
    "the contribution of topological configurations however depend on the number of flavors and the number of external legs of the correlator .",
