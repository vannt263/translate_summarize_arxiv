    "the exponential growth in optical telecommunications and the internet has been underpinned by the development of semiconductor lasers emitting at 1.3 @xmath3 m and at 1.55 @xmath3 m , the wavelengths at which respectively dispersion is zero and losses are minimised in standard optical fibres @xcite .",
    "the lasers designed to operate at these wavelengths are based primarily on the growth of quaternary ingaasp and ingaalas alloy structures on inp substrates . despite their widespread application ,",
    "there are several significant drawbacks associated with these devices , mostly associated with the constraints of growing on inp substrates .",
    "the development of telecomm lasers grown on gaas substrates could bring several advantages .",
    "firstly , because gaas is a more robust material , growth can be carried out on larger substrates .",
    "secondly , better optical confinement can be achieved in gaas heterostructures , because of the larger refractive index difference between gaas and algaas compared to that between inp and the quaternary alloys .",
    "vertical cavity surface emitting lasers can therefore be grown monolithically on gaas , but only with great difficulty on inp .",
    "in addition , because algaas has a considerably larger energy gap than inp and can be grown lattice - matched on gaas , it should be possible to achieve much better electrical confinement in a telecomm laser based on gaas .",
    "a further issue with 1.3 and 1.55 @xmath3 m semiconductor lasers is that their threshold current and the optical cavity losses tend to increase strongly with increasing temperature , due largely to a combination of two intrinsic loss mechanisms , auger recombination @xcite and intervalence band absorption @xcite .",
    "telecomm lasers then need to be operated on a thermo - electric cooler for many applications , significantly increasing the overall energy budget associated with their operation .",
    "considerable advantage could therefore be gained if high quality and reliable telecomm lasers could be developed on gaas .",
    "this is very difficult to achieve using conventional quantum well structures .",
    "highly efficient lasers using strained ingaas quantum well structures are very well established for emission around 1 @xmath3 m , but too much in is needed and there is therefore too large a lattice mismatch relative to gaas to achieve reliable lasers emitting at 1.3 @xmath3 m and beyond @xcite .",
    "there was therefore considerable interest generated when it was shown that replacing a small fraction of as atoms by n in ga(in)as leads to a rapid reduction in energy gap , with the gap decreasing by about 150 mev for @xmath4% in gan@xmath0as@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to achieve longer wavelength emission on a gaas substrate , supporting the demonstration of 1.3 @xmath3 m edge - emitting and vertical cavity lasers @xcite , as well as 1.5 @xmath3 m edge - emitting devices @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of dilute nitride alloys is of considerable interest from a theoretical perspective , both to understand the origins of the rapid reduction in energy gap and also to understand the consequences of that reduction for laser action .",
    "it is well established that replacing a single as atom by n in gaas introduces a resonant defect state above the conduction band edge @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough was achieved for dilute nitride alloys with the demonstration by walukiewicz and co - workers that the reduction in energy gap in ga(in)n@xmath0as@xmath1 is due to a band - anticrossing interaction between the conduction band edge and higher - lying localised nitrogen resonant states @xcite .",
    "given the significant differences in the conduction band structure of gainnas compared to conventional iii - v semiconductors , it is important to elucidate the influence of n not only on the electronic structure but also on the gain characteristics of ideal dilute nitride lasers .",
    "we have shown @xcite and describe below that the incorporation of n degrades properties such as differential gain compared to that of the best gainas / gaas structures .",
    "nevertheless , the overall characteristics of an ideal gainnas / gaas laser are still expected to be at least as good as those of conventional inp - based telecomm lasers .",
    "having established the characteristics of ideal structures , we then turn to consider actual gainnas lasers operating in the telecomm wavelength band between 1.3 and 1.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "we have shown experimentally that the threshold current of gainnas lasers is dominated by non - radiative recombination processes , including both defect - related and auger recombination @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite and experimental analysis @xcite show that auger recombination is a major loss mechanism in gainnas- and in inp - based 1.3 and 1.5 @xmath3 m lasers . in the dominant chsh auger process ,",
    "a * * c**onduction electron and a * * h**eavy hole recombine across the energy gap but , instead of emitting a photon , they excite into the * * s**pin - split - off band a * * h**ole from near the valence band maximum @xcite .",
    "chsh auger recombination is the dominant intrinsic loss mechanism that ultimately limits all current telecomm lasers . because auger recombination involves three carriers , its contribution to the threshold current density increases ( using the boltzmann approximation ) as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the threshold carrier density .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath5 with temperature then explains the strong temperature sensitivity of the threshold current in semiconductor diode lasers at telecomm and longer wavelengths .",
    "in addition to auger recombination , inter - valence band absorption ( ivba ) also degrades laser performance . in the ivba process ,",
    "a photon is re - absorbed by an electron in the spin - split - off band which is excited to an empty ( hole ) state near the top of the valence band . like the chsh auger process , ivba is therefore also sensitive to the spin - split - off energy .",
    "ivba causes @xmath6 to increase superlinearly with temperature @xcite , further exacerbating auger recombination and additionally degrading the differential quantum efficiency above threshold .",
    "the combination of auger recombination and ivba causes the output power of telecomm lasers to be strongly temperature sensitive over the typical operating temperature range @xcite",
    ".    it would therefore be highly beneficial if these loss mechanisms could be eliminated from telecomm lasers .",
    "this can not be achieved using conventional iii - v alloys based on ( gaalin)(npassb ) , where the energy gap @xmath7 always exceeds the spin - orbit splitting energy @xmath8 in materials that emit at 1.3 and 1.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that replacing as by bi in gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 can give rise to a strong decrease in the band gap as well as a strong increase in the spin - orbit - splitting energy , leading to a @xmath9 regime in the alloy for @xmath10% @xcite . just as the introduction of n gives the possibility to engineer the conduction band structure",
    ", the introduction of bi then provides an opportunity to engineer the valence band structure potentially providing a route to produce telecomm and longer wavelength lasers with suppressed losses @xcite .",
    "this review aims to provide an overview of the electronic structure of highly mismatched semiconductor alloys and of the consequences and potential benefits of such alloys for optoelectronic applications . in section 2",
    "we present an overview of the band - anticrossing model used to describe the conduction band structure of dilute nitride alloys . a brief discussion of the effective masses and band offsets used in calculations on gainnas / gaas material systems is given in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the effects of nitrogen incorporation on gain and loss mechanisms in ideal gainnas lasers , followed by a comparison between ideal and actual device behaviour .",
    "having established through this comparison that auger recombination remains a significant loss mechanism in all telecomm lasers to date , we then present in section 5 an overview of the potential benefits of dilute bismide alloys for future , high efficiency photonic devices .",
    "finally we summarise our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "it is well - established that when a single n atom replaces an as atom in gaas , it forms a resonant defect level above the conduction band edge of gaas @xcite .",
    "this defect level arises because of the large difference in electronegativity and atomic size between n and as @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough was achieved for dilute nitride alloys with the demonstration by walukiewicz and co - workers using hydrostatic pressure techniques that the reduction in energy gap in ga(in)n@xmath0as@xmath1 is due to a band - anticrossing ( bac ) interaction between the conduction band edge and higher - lying localised nitrogen resonant states @xcite .",
    "the bac model explains the extreme band gap bowing observed in in@xmath11ga@xmath12n@xmath0as@xmath1 in terms of an interaction between two levels , one at energy @xmath13 associated with the extended conduction band edge ( cbe ) state @xmath14 of the gainas matrix and the other at energy @xmath15 associated with the localised n impurity states @xmath16 , with the two states linked by a matrix element @xmath17 describing the interaction between them @xcite .",
    "the conduction band ( cb ) dispersion of ga(in)n@xmath0as@xmath1 is then given in the bac model by the lower eigenvalue of the determinant    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is an appropriately chosen cbe effective mass for the ga(in)as host matrix material @xcite . from eq .",
    "[ eq:2_band_bac ] , the cbe energy , @xmath20 , is then given by    @xmath21    the alloy cbe wavefunction @xmath22 can be found from eq .",
    "[ eq:2_band_bac ] as @xmath23 .",
    "the fractional @xmath24 character of @xmath22 is given by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 then providing a useful measure of how much the n - related states in the alloy perturb the cbe wavefunction .",
    "a resonant feature associated with the upper eigenvalue , @xmath27 , has been observed in photo - reflectance ( pr ) measurements @xcite , appearing in gan@xmath0as@xmath1 for @xmath28 0.2% and remaining a relatively sharp feature until @xmath29 3% , beyond which composition it broadens and weakens , when the resonant state becomes degenerate with the gaas @xmath30-related conduction band levels @xcite .",
    "the data points in figure  [ fig : ganas_pr ] show the measured variation of the @xmath20 and @xmath27 energy levels with n composition @xmath2 at room temperature in gan@xmath0as@xmath1 .",
    "these measured values are very well fitted using the bac model , as illustrated by the solid lines in figure  [ fig : ganas_pr ] , for which we use @xmath31 ev , @xmath32 ev and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 2.3 ev @xcite .",
    "the bac interaction not only reduces the energy gap but is also predicted to lead to an increased electron effective mass at the cb minimum and to a strongly nonparabolic cb dispersion .",
    "evidence for this dispersion is provided by photo - reflectance measurements of ganas quantum well ( qw ) samples , where the strong band nonparabolicity is required to account for the qw excited state transition energies across a wide range of samples and as a function of hydrostatic pressure @xcite .    despite the wide success of the 2-level bac model",
    ", it should be acknowledged that there are several sets of experimental data which it fails to explain .",
    "for example , it significantly underestimates the electron relative effective mass , @xmath35 , in gan@xmath0as@xmath1 for @xmath36 0.1% @xcite .",
    "the effective mass has been determined using a range of different techniques , with a consistent trend emerging of unexpectedly large relative mass values in gan@xmath0as@xmath1 , such as @xmath37 0.13 , 0.15 and even 0.19 for @xmath38 0.1 @xcite , 1.6 @xcite and 2.0% @xcite , respectively .",
    "detailed calculations have shown that these effects arise due to the formation of n pairs and clusters in the material , which can generate defect states lying close to the cbe of gan@xmath0as@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hybridization between these localised states and the host matrix cbe strongly perturbs the electronic structure , with the strength of the hybridization determined by the relative separation in energy between the n - related defect states and the cbe @xcite .",
    "in inas the localised states related to n pairs and higher order complexes lie significantly above the inas cbe , so that replacing ga by in to form in@xmath11ga@xmath12n@xmath0as@xmath1 shifts the cbe away from the n cluster state distribution @xcite .",
    "this significantly reduces the effects of n cluster states on the cbe , meaning that the bac model has been largely successful when applied to in@xmath11ga@xmath12n@xmath0as@xmath1 alloys , accounting well for the observed bac - like energy gaps and effective masses in these alloys @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of conventional semiconductor lasers is typically analysed using an 8-band * * k**@xmath39*p * model , including the conduction band , heavy - hole , light - hole and spin - split - off bands @xcite .",
    "this can be expanded to a 10-band * * k**@xmath39*p * model for gainnas , obtained by adding two additional spin - degenerate nitrogen - related states to the 8-band * * k**@xmath39*p * model @xcite .",
    "this model has provided valuable insight into the optoelectronic properties of gainnas alloys , having been successfully used to accurately model , for example , the measured optical transitions @xcite and electron effective masses @xcite in gainnas quantum wells ( qws ) , as well as gain and loss mechanisms in 1.3 @xmath3 m gainnas qw lasers @xcite .",
    "a range of studies have successfully interpreted the band structure of gainnas alloys using the bac model . as an example ,",
    "figure  [ fig : gainnas_effective_masses ] compares the measured cbe effective mass in gainnas with that predicted using the 2-level bac model . in all cases the effective mass is increased compared to that in gaas , due to the bac interaction .",
    "it can be seen that there is generally good agreement between the theoretical and experimental data , reflecting that there are few or no cluster states near to the cbe in this alloy @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to provide a unique set of bac parameters for gainnas alloys .",
    "this is because the band structure depends on the local environment about each n atom .",
    "the energy @xmath15 of the isolated n defect energy levels shifts down in energy as ga neighbours are replaced by in neighbours @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the bac interaction , @xmath17 also decreases with increasing number of in neighbours , because the in - n equilibrium bond length is larger than the ga - n one , leading to a reduced distortion about a n site with increasing number of in neighbours .",
    "the energy gap of gainnas alloys is typically found to blue shift after brief thermal annealing @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to an increase in the average number of in neighbours on annealing @xcite .",
    "bac parameter sets have been developed to describe annealed gainnas @xcite .",
    "although there are differences between the various reported sets , these differences do not affect the overall conclusions discussed below .",
    "there was considerable initial uncertainty as to the choice of conduction and valence band ( vb ) offsets to use in gainnas / gaas qw structures , with the choice of band offset values also impacting the gain characteristics .",
    "because of the strong band - anticrossing interaction , the cb offset and the band offset ratio vary strongly with n composition in ga(in)nas / gaas heterostructures and therefore it is most useful to work with the vb offset .",
    "we assume that the introduction of n to form in@xmath11ga@xmath12n@xmath0as@xmath1 leads to a linear variation in vb edge energy in the unstrained alloy , which we describe by the parameter @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , where @xmath2 is the nitrogen fraction",
    ". how does introduction of n affect the vb offset ?",
    "this is difficult to measure by optical spectroscopy , because of the number of free parameters available when fitting to ground and excited state transition energies , including the nitrogen energy , @xmath15 , bac coupling parameter , @xmath42 and the band offset @xmath40 parameter . as a consequence , a wide variety of offset values were presented in the literature .",
    "these range from values that give a type i structure for a in@xmath11ga@xmath12n@xmath0as@xmath1/gaas qw @xcite to those that favour a type ii structure @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath40 used in the literature have ranged from -1.87 ev @xcite to 3.5 ev @xcite .",
    "galluppi et al .",
    "@xcite undertook a systematic study of the hh vb offset in a series of gainnas samples with in concentrations up to 34% and for a range of n concentrations up to and above 2% .",
    "they found a small decrease in the vb offset with increasing n concentration , predominantly because of the reduction in the hh - lh splitting due to the reduction in compressive strain in the inganas qws due to n incorporation .",
    "a similar reduction was also observed for smaller in concentrations ( 0  20% ) by heroux and coworkers @xcite , who also attributed the slight decrease in vbo to a reduction in the net compressive strain . a small value of @xmath43 0.2 ev has also been deduced from tight - binding calculations @xcite .",
    "based on these experimental and theoretical results , we therefore recommend a value of @xmath44 0 to model the band structure of gainnas / gaas heterostructures .    with the choice of @xmath45 , there is then a large conduction band offset and comparatively small valence band offset in gainnas .",
    "this has led to the concern that the small valence band offset may lead to leakage currents contributing to the total threshold current in gainnas lasers @xcite . however , self - consistent calculations show that because the electrons are strongly confined in gainnas / gaas qw structures , the high electron density provides an additional electrostatic contribution to the valence band confinement potential , thereby reducing the impact of the small valence band offset @xcite .",
    "the major driver towards the development of dilute nitride iii - v compounds was the realization by kondow and coworkers @xcite that these alloys offer a viable route to achieve gaas - based quantum well ( qw ) laser diodes emitting in the 1.3 and 1.5 @xmath3 m optical windows .",
    "these gainnas / gaas qw structures also provide the benefits associated with compressively strained devices @xcite .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of n in the gainnas layers increases the cb offset , leading to improved electron confinement when compared with conventional ingaasp 1.3 @xmath3 m lasers @xcite . both edge - emitting and vertical - cavity ( vcsel ) laser structures",
    "have been reported with impressive characteristics , as discussed further below .",
    "given the significant difference between the cb structure of gainnas and conventional iii - v semiconductors , it is important not only to elucidate the influence of n on the electronic structure and gain characteristics of ideal dilute nitride lasers , but also to apply that understanding to the experimental analysis of gainnas lasers operating in the telecomm wavelength band between 1.3 and 1.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "we present here a theoretical overview of the consequences of the electronic structure of dilute nitride alloys for laser emission .",
    "we summarise the influence of nitrogen incorporation on the calculated dipole matrix elements , electron effective mass , gain and differential gain versus carrier density and radiative current density , as well as the effect of n on the primary loss mechanisms of defect - related and auger recombination .",
    "we then compare the theoretically estimated laser characteristics of gainnas - based and conventional ingaasp - based 1.3 @xmath3 m lasers .",

    "the dashed line shows the calculated band dispersion of the equivalent n - free 7 nm wide in@xmath46ga@xmath47as / gaas quantum well structure .",
    "an increased band edge effective mass and a strong nonparabolicity are clearly visible in the cb dispersion in the gainnas qw , due to the interaction between the lowest conduction states and the n resonant levels .",

    "the band structure and matrix elements presented in figures  [ fig : gainnas_qw_band_structure ] and  [ fig : gainnas_qw_transition_strengths ] were used to calculate the variation of material gain with temperature @xmath60 and as a function of carrier density @xmath61 and of radiative current density @xmath62 both in an in@xmath46ga@xmath47n@xmath48as@xmath49/gaas qw structure and in an equivalent n - free structure @xcite . the increase in the conduction band",
    "effective mass leads to an increase in the carrier concentration at transparency for the in@xmath46ga@xmath47n@xmath48as@xmath49/gaas qw laser structure and a decrease in the separation between the conduction and valence band quasi - fermi energies , @xmath63 , for a fixed carrier concentration . as a consequence the peak gain decreases at a fixed carrier density in the in@xmath46ga@xmath47n@xmath48as@xmath49/gaas structure when compared to the n - free case , figure  [ fig : gainnas_qw_gain_n ] .",
    "there is however a much weaker variation in the peak gain versus radiative current density , figure  [ fig : gainnas_qw_gain_jrad ] .",
    "this weak variation reflects the fact that for a fixed quasi - fermi level separation , the radiative current @xmath62 in a qw laser is approximately proportional to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the band edge reduced effective mass .",

    "thirdly , detailed calculations on large ordered and disordered supercells showed that the large bowing of @xmath7 with bi composition arises not only from a strong upward shift of the alloy vbe with composition ( due to anticrossing with lower lying bi - related states ) , but that a significant conventional alloy reduction in the cbe energy also contributes to the observed reduction in the band gap .",
