    "the structure @xmath19 is called a and @xmath20 a .",
    "note that @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; thus conditions ( 1 ) and ( 1 ) can be writen as equations . for ( 2 ) and ( 2 )",
    ", we have @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath23 and @xmath12 equivalent to @xmath24",
    ". therefore the class of weakly dicomplemented lattices form a variety .",
    "we denote it by . similarly , the class  of weakly complemented lattices and the class  of dual weakly complemented lattices are varieties .",
    "these classes have been introduced to capture the notion of negation on `` concepts''@xcite , based on the work of boole  @xcite .",
    "the following properties are easy to verify :    * @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 by ( 3 ) and ( 3 ) , * @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a kernel operator on @xmath5 as well as @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a closure operator on @xmath5 by ( 1)(2 ) .    before we move to more properties , we give some examples .    1",
    ".   the motivating examples of s are concept algebras . these are concept lattices with a weak negation and a weak opposition . for a detailed account on concept algebras",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "2 .   the natural examples of s are boolean algebras .",
    "in fact if @xmath34 is a boolean algebra then @xmath35 ( the complementation is duplicated , i.e. @xmath36 ) is a weakly dicomplemented lattice .",
    "each bounded lattice can be endowed with a trivial weak dicomplementation by defining @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the dicomplement of @xmath39 and of each @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "[ t : wcl ] weakly complemented lattice are exactly non empty lattices satisfying the equations ( 1)(3 ) in definition  [ d : wdl ] .    of course",
    ", weakly complemented lattices satisfy the equations ( 1)(3 ) in definition  [ d : wdl ] .",
    "so what we should prove , is that , all lattices satifying the equations @xmath41 are bounded .",
    "let @xmath5 be a non empty lattice satisfying the equations ( 1)(3 ) .",
    "let @xmath42 .",
    "we set @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we are going to prove that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the greatest and lowest element of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath47 be an arbitrary element of @xmath5 .",
    "we have @xmath48 , by ( 3 ) .",
    "thus @xmath49 is the greatest element of @xmath5 . of course , if @xmath5 was equipped with a unary operation @xmath7 satisfying the equation ( 1)(3 ) we could use the same argument as above to say that @xmath50 is the smallest element of @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately we have to check that @xmath44 is less than every element of @xmath5 .",
    "so let @xmath51 .",
    "we want to prove that @xmath52 .",

    "for an arbitrary element @xmath55 of @xmath5 , we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 henceforth @xmath58 .",

    "we assume that @xmath61 is a and @xmath62 . recall that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then with @xmath62 , @xmath14 is a complement of @xmath15 . to prove the distributivity",
