    "the free parameters which bear directly on f(o ) are @xmath14 , the mass loss parameter on the tp - agb for a scaled reimers ( 1975 ) law , and @xmath15 , the fraction of core growth between two consecutive thermal pulse that is dredged - up and mixed .",
    "we kept fixed the other parameters in gj93 : the minimum core mass for 3@xmath16 dredge - up , @xmath17m@xmath1 ; the mass loss parameter for the red giant branch , @xmath18 ; the mass loss parameter for the early - agb , @xmath19 .",
    "the model was required to reproduce the c star lf in the lmc and the initial - final mass relation for stars in the solar neighbourhood , as in gj93 ( sect .",

    "[ fig : mz ] will be referred to as our standard model .",
    "the stellar ejecta were averaged over the last 25000  yr , to compare with gas - phase abundances .",
    "the different pn classes based on the relative abundances of @xmath24c , @xmath25c , n , o have their niche : o rich pne are expected for both the lowest and highest @xmath26 ( type i pne occurring for the highest progenitor masses ) , and @xmath24c/@xmath25c ranges from cn equilibrium values ( @xmath273 ) to @xmath28100 .",
    "if the stellar ejecta is averaged over the last 2000  yr only , which is taken to represent warm - dust compositions ( see section  [ sec : linking ] ) , the contours for pn compositions are still the same as in fig .",

    "[ fig : mz ] , but the point to point variations are sharper and reach higher peak value ( @xmath2713 and 3000 at @xmath30  yr against @xmath277 and 900 at @xmath31  yr , for c / o and @xmath24c/@xmath25c , respectively ) .",
    "there is one important change between @xmath30  yr and @xmath31  yr , however : in terms of the pn compositions , for @xmath30  yr the effects of hbb for masses higher than 45  m@xmath1 are not as dramatic , and c / o@xmath32 even for the most massive progenitors ( see frost et al .",
    "1998 for a physical discussion on the quenching of hbb ) .",
    "in order to reproduce the range of n and c enrichment found in pne and to account for the observed frequencies of type i and iia pne , we find that hbb must be much more efficient than currently modelled .",
    "as noted by leisy & dennefeld ( 1996 ) , there is continuity in the nitrogen abundances of pne in the lmc , with no particular grouping above the type i threshold . and",
    "yet at z=0.008 , typical of the lmc , the synthetic agb model predicts no type iia pne at all ( in the fandez - abans & maciel 1987 classification , i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "these conclusions also hold for the gj93 model : with their treatment of hbb , fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] is largely unchanged ( except perhaps at @xmath34 , where the type  i threshold is at 4.6  m@xmath1 instead of 5.5  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "models in which core - growth on the agb is negligible , and where hbb effectively occurs above a critical core mass , predict a sharp transition in n / o ratio and progenitor mass , which is not observed .    additionally , the majority of very c - rich pne ( those whose mid - ir spectra display the family of emission bands associated with pahs ) are of type i ( paper  i ) .",
    "however , the existing synthetic agb models can not produce n - rich and very c - rich pne in the observed frequency .",
    "[ fig : mz ] shows how the highest c enrichment should be found for pne with solar n / o ratios ( again , the pn composition map obtained with a 2000  yr average of agb mass - loss leaves fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] largely unchanged ) . in terms of the gas - phase abundances ,",
    "type i pne are divided in their c / o chemical balance ( leisy & dennefeld 1996 , their fig .  12 ; see also aller & czyzak 1983 for galactic disk pne ) .",
    "but the sharp onset of hbb with @xmath26 produces o - rich pne , exclusively ( for @xmath35 ) .",
    "an exception to the above problems with synthetic agb models is provided by rv81 .",
    "it appears that rv81 underestimated the mass loss rate ( @xmath36 predicts excessive final masses , gj93 and references therein ) , and the extended lifetime allows the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope to rise significantly with the growth of the core during the tp - agb .",
    "a @xmath37  m@xmath11 star can start dredging - up carbon and then undergo hbb later in its evolution , in a balance that produces c and n rich pne . thus the problems with c and n enrichment in pne could be solved by artificially fixing the slope for the increase of hbb temperature with core - growth , @xmath38 , to the values found by fc97 for their 56m@xmath1 models .",
    "we found that models with @xmath39km@xmath40 produce type  i and iia pne in the observed frequencies ( around 30% and 20% in the sample of paper  i , see also maciel & dutra 1992 ) , with type  i pne being preferentially very c - rich . an interesting alternative to a high @xmath41 slope can be found in siess & livio ( 1999 ) .",
    "the accretion of brown dwarfs or giant planets could trigger cno processing in the convective envelope .",
    "although the concept of envelope heating from the kinetic energy of accreted material is appealing , it is not obviously related to the observed n / o latitude effect .",
    "thus the n / o classification of pne , perhaps one of their most widely used chemical characteristic , turned out to be impossible to use in pn population synthesis , at least with the models we tried . on the other hand , f(o )",
    "depends mostly on @xmath42 coupled with the core mass at the first thermal pulse ( in this formalism ) .",
    "in fact , above a threshold initial mass , all pne are predicted to generate c - rich warm dust during the earliest stages of their evolution .",
    "f(o ) is therefore a much easier quantity to model .      a set of 10000 stars",
    "was evolved to construct the synthetic distribution of pne in the galactic disk .",
    "the probability distribution for the star formation rate as a function of galactocentric radius was extrapolated from the ultra - compact hii region survey in bronfman et al .",
    "we assumed the number density of massive star forming regions would also trace the number density of newly born pn progenitors .",
    "initial stellar masses were distributed according to an initial mass function ( imf ) index of @xmath43 ( in @xmath44 ) .",
    "this index is also used in the derivation of the lmc c star lf ( section  [ sec : lmctest ] ) , and is the same as in gj93 . the lower mass cutoff for the compact pne progenitors",
    "was kept as a free parameter , @xmath45 , and the upper mass limit was 7m@xmath1 .",
    "the imf index may seem steep for intermediate mass stars , and we investigated using @xmath46 , as derived in sabas ( 1997 ) from a complete sample of b5-f5 stars and hipparcos parallaxes ( over 1.24 m@xmath1 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath45 turned out to be somewhat lower ( see section  [ sec : min_mass ] ) .",

    "the age - velocity relation by wielen ( 1977 ) , @xmath47 in conjunction with a velocity ellipsoid of constant shape ( wielen 1977 ) , @xmath48 allows to estimate the spread of the normal distribution by which final galactocentric radii are distributed ( wielen et al .",

    "their distribution was modelled by applying the same selection criterion to the synthetic pn population .",
    "it is shown in paper  i that the pne with warm dust should be optically thick in the lyman continuum , in which case the four _ iras _ bands give a good representation of their bolometric flux , with a fraction of @xmath57 of the total flux in the 12@xmath7 m band .",

    "these requirements give a local linear density of visual extinction of only 0.25  magkpc@xmath51 , and the value of @xmath68  mag may seem low as well .",
    "however , we did not take into account the dependence of @xmath64 on height above the galactic plane , and that pne would preferentially be discovered towards directions of low extinction : if the average linear density of extinction to local pne were really 1  magkpc@xmath51 , no pne would be detected beyond 4kpc .",
    "it is apparent from fig .  6 in paper",
    "i that the maximum distance to galactic disk pne with warm dust is about 8kpc , which we adopted as a maximum distance in the synthetic population .",
    "this estimate of the sampled area in the galactic disk is intented to approximate the observed face - on distribution .    in the case of the pne with warm dust emission features ,",
    "the problem of a lifetime dependence on the progenitor mass is greatly simplified by the presumed youth of the objects .",
    "we assumed that the compact and ir - bright pne with warm dust emission all have the same lifetime , neglecting any dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that the durations of the ` warm - dust ' phase lifetimes could depend on the dust opacities .",
    "it was suggested to us ( kevin volk , private communication ) that this could be the reason why the fraction of o - rich objects is f(o)@xmath2722% from the dust grain compositions , while it is closer to 40% from the plasma diagnostics . some arguments against this possibility",
    "may be found in section  6 of paper  i , and the next section develops the idea that the difference in f(o ) could be due to the different timescale over which the agb ejecta should be averaged ( @xmath71 in this work ) . in any case , the conclusions we reach on f(o ) being a tight constraint on agb parameters are valid even if f(o)@xmath2750% .",
    "a lower metallicity limit for the production of dust is discarded , as even some very low metallicity pne show warm - dust emission ( e.g. in a forthcoming article on bulge pne , we will report on the type  iv pn m  2 - 29 , that shows the silicate signature in spite of a very low o abundance of [ o / h]@xmath72  dex , as estimated by ratag et al .",
    "1997 ) .    since pne with no warm dust correspond to later evolutionary stages ( paper  i )",
    ", the link between the computed c / o ratios and the dust features is very tight .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , silicates represent c / o@xmath731 , and sic and uir bands c / o@xmath281 .",
    "the only problem left in linking the synthetic and observed pn populations is defining how to compute the average compositions . if the warm dust grains are heated directly by radiation from the central stars , then a temperature of 100200k places the grains at @xmath74 cm from the exciting star , which corresponds to an ejection age of 400yr at 10kms@xmath51 . in this picture",
    ", the warm dust grain composition derives from the very last stages of agb evolution .",
    "thus the pne compositions were averaged over the last 2000  yr , to compare with the dust emission features , while a more topical 25000  yr was used to compare with the gas phase abundances .    the resulting synthetic distribution can be seen in figure [ fig : synt_distr ] , in the case of a minimum progenitor mass of 1.2m@xmath75 .",
    "galactocentric azimuths were drawn from a uniform random distribution .",
    "having calibrated all the free - parameters in the synthetic agb model , the mass range for pn progenitors still needs to be specified .",
    "the lower mass limit has a direct influence on the synthesised pn distribution , although the exact upper mass limit is of secondary importance , high mass stars being less frequent .",
    "the property of the synthetic distribution that can be most directly compared to the observed distribution of pne with warm dust is the relative frequency of c - rich and o - rich nebulae . shown in figure  [ fig : results ] is the fraction of o rich pne as a function of minimum progenitor mass , @xmath45 , for the set of parameters given in section  [ sec : sagb_params ] .",
    "pn compositions were computed by averaging the stellar mass loss over the last @xmath76  yr of evolution on the agb to compare with the dust signatures .",

    "this result can also be reached by estimating the proportion of progenitors between @xmath6 and @xmath86  m@xmath1 , even for a shallow imf .",
    "either this is yet another deficiency of current models for n enrichment , or the pn sample is dramatically affected by biases against low mass progenitors .",
    "the latter case seems rather contrived ; a complete pn sample is a working hypotheses for this article , and in the event of a strongly biased sample , @xmath6 represents a lower mass limit above which we trust the observed f(o ) - as well as f(type  i ) .",
    "additionally , we know n enrichment is not satisfactorily modelled ( e.g. section  [ sec : pb_n ] ) .    for comparison the gas phase abundance distribution synthesised with @xmath87  yr predicts 512% more o - rich pne , depending on @xmath6 , and around 28% for @xmath88  m@xmath1 ( which gives f(o)=22% if @xmath76 ) .",

    "the following include an explicit metallicity dependence :    * the core - mass - interpulse period relation , * mass loss prior to the agb , * core - mass at the first thermal pulse , * luminosity at the first thermal pulse , * core - mass - luminosity relation , * @xmath105 , * evolution rate , * hot bottom burning density and temperature .    the synthetic pn population was tested for sensitivity on the galactic metallicity gradient by fixing the metallicity entry of all the previously listed relations at @xmath106 .",
    "the initial composition was kept as described in the appendix , i.e. a metallicity - scaled solar mix , with a galactic metallicity gradient and an age - metallicity relation .",
    "the resulting synthetic pn population did not show a gradient in the fraction of o - rich pne .",
    "subsequently the constraint on the metallicity was relaxed one relation at a time , and the resulting model population was inspected using the equivalent of fig .",
    "[ fig : results2]a .",
    "the difference in the fraction of o - rich pne inside and outside the solar circle was used to test the dependence upon the metallicity gradient .",
    "the most sensitive relations are @xmath105 and the core - mass at the first thermal pulse .",
    "the other relations resulted in an insignificant change in the fraction of o - rich pne inside and outside r@xmath107 .",
    "the synthetic population generated using a flat metallicity profile was confirmed not to show a gradient in the fraction of o - rich pne .",
    "the metallicity dependence of f(o ) resides in the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath108 increases with lower metallicity , which for a fixed luminosity translates into a lower envelope radius , and a lower mass - loss rate .",
    "the extended agb - lifetime thus leaves more time for core - growth and the c - enrichment of the envelope .",
    "the relation used here for @xmath108 , is a model result from wood ( 1990 , see also vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "2 .   the core - mass at the first thermal pulse , @xmath109 , is a decreasing function of metallicity .",
    "together with a fixed minimum core - mass for the occurrence of the third dredge - up ( the free parameter @xmath110 ) , the lower limit progenitor zams mass for the production of c - rich nebulae decreases with metallicity .",
    "a full search in all possible combinations in parameter space is postponed to a future investigation , based on a more solid agb model , and a larger pn sample .",
    "pn population synthesis was investigated using a schematic model for agb evolution , whose free - parameters were calibrated with the luminosity function of c stars in the lmc and the initial - final mass relation .",
    "the galactic distribution of pn progenitors was generated using the observed metallicity gradient and distribution of star forming regions with galactocentric radius .",
    "the pne with warm dust emission from paper  i represent a homogeneous population , which is presumably young and thus minimally affected by a possible dependence of pn lifetime on progenitor mass .",
    "we examined the consequences of assuming the statistics of pn compositions in the sample of paper  i reflect tip - of - the - agb values , and reached the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the fraction of pne with o - rich dust places constraints on the range of pn progenitor masses .",
    "a minimum pn progenitor mass of 1m@xmath1 predicts that about 50% of all young pne should be o - rich , when only 22% is observed .",
    "the minimum pn progenitor mass required to reproduce the properties of the observed distribution of pne with warm dust is @xmath2 , at a @xmath3 confidence level .",
    "2 .   the observed decrease in the fraction of o - rich pne with galactocentric radius is a robust property of the synthetic distribution .",
    "3 .   independently of @xmath6 , values for the dredge up parameter @xmath15 and the mass - loss rate parameter @xmath14 that reproduce the lmc c star lf , do not necessarily match the observed fraction of o - rich pne , f(o ) .",
    "the relative frequencies of c- and o - rich pne depend mostly on the value of the minimum core mass for c dredge - up , which is calibrated with the lmc c star lf ( as in gj93 ) .",
    "but the treatment of hbb is of crucial importance in predicting pn compositions , as it directly accounts for the peimbert ( 1978 ) types .",
    "measurements of the @xmath24c to @xmath25c isotopic ratio in pne can provide an observational test , since a transition from @xmath28100 to @xmath273 is expected with the onset of hbb ( e.g. rv81 ) .",
    "overall , the good agreement obtained with the observed pn distribution is an indication that the statistics of dust signatures in pne can be used as probes of their progenitor population in various galactic environments .",

    "<S> for our best model , a minimum pn progenitor mass @xmath0  m@xmath1 predicts that about 50% of all young pne should be o - rich , compared to an observed fraction of 22% ; thus @xmath2  m@xmath1 , at a @xmath3 confidence level ( @xmath4  m@xmath1 at @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , current agb models for single stars can account neither for the continuous range of n enrichment ( leisy & dennefeld 1996 ) , nor for the observation that the majority of very c - rich pne have peimbert type  i ( paper  i ) . </S>",
    "<S> f(o ) is thus an observable much easier to model . </S>",
