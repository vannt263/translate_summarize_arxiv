    "there is increasing evidence that protostellar jets are driven by circumstellar magnetized disks associated with pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. knigl & ruden 1993 ; shu et al .",
    "efficient mass loss in supersonic , collimated magnetized outflows is the most likely mechanism by which protostars dissipate the angular momentum accumulated during the accretion of the surrounding material . while of fundamental importance in the production and initial collimation of the jets ,",
    "magnetic fields have been generally neglected in most of the analytical and numerical modeling of the structure of protostellar jets since the inferred estimates of their strength ( @xmath6 g ) suggested that they could be not dynamically important along the flow ( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "however , recent observations of circularly polarized radio emission of the young stellar outflow of t tauri s ( ray et al .",
    "1997 ) , for example , indicate the presence of a strong , ordered magnetic field in the flow , far away from the source , which has possibly been amplified by compression behind the shocks at the head of the outflow . after amplification and re - orientation behind the shocks",
    ", such magnetic fields may operate significant changes on the dynamics and collimation of a jet and also in its head structure as suggested by recent numerical studies ( see below ) .",
    "great effort has been concentrated in the analytical and numerical study of magnetized , adiabatic , light jets , aiming mostly the investigation of extragalactic jets ( see , e.g. birkinshaw 1997 for a review ) .",
    "most of that work has focused on the study of the stability properties of the beam against hydromagnetic and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities . in the limit of zero - velocity difference between the jet and the surrounding medium ,",
    "linear theory predicts that a jet magnetically confined by a toroidal field is unstable to the pinch and kink ( or helical ) _ hydromagnetic _ modes ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1961 ) with the temporal growth rates of the pinching mode increasing with increasing density ratio , @xmath5 , between the jet and the ambient medium . in the presence of a non - zero velocity discontinuity at the boundary layer separating the two fluids ,",
    "these pure hydromagnetic modes are modified by the development of the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability .",
    "a jet confined by a toroidal magnetic field is unstable to the fundamental and reflection pinch and kink modes of the k - h instability ( cohn 1983 ; fiedler & jones 1984 ) .",
    "the most unstable pinching mode in this case , at wavelengths @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the jet radius ) , has a destabilization length @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the jet mach number ) , which is similar to the pure hydrodynamical ( hd ) case for jets with @xmath11 ( cohn 1983 ) . in the case of magnetized jets with a longitudinal magnetic field residing in an unmagnetized medium , all",
    "k - h modes become stable for sub - alfvnic flows ( except for a small region of slow reflection modes ; e.g. , bodo et al . 1989 ; hardee et al .",
    "1992 ; hardee , clarke & rosen 1997 ) . in the super - alfvnic regime , on the other hand , the growth rates of the instability are not very much different from those of pure hd flows .",
    "for example , a fundamental kink mode in the pure hd case can be identified with an alfvn disturbance of long wavelength in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) case , and reflection modes at shorter wavelengths can be identified with fast magnetosonic ( ms ) waves reflecting off the jet boundaries . in this super - alfvnic regime , if the jet is also supermagnetosonic ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath14 is the jet sound speed ) , then it becomes more stable with increasing @xmath15 , with the destabilization length varying approximately proportional to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ( hardee et al .",
    "also , strong toroidal fields of strength comparable to the poloidal field can lead to increased jet stability ( appl & camenzind 1992 ; thiele & camenzind 1997 ) .",
    "the effects of the k - h modes on the survival of the beam , however , can not be predicted by the linear theory alone . as in pure hd flows , the fastest growing , shortest wavelength reflection modes are expected to saturate with the formation of weak oblique shocks , while the fundamental modes may not saturate and may cause large - scale distortions and even disruption of the flow .",
    "numerical simulations which can determine the end points of the operation of these instabilities confirm these predictions .",
    "hardee et al . ( 1992 ) and hardee , clarke & rosen ( 1997 ) , for example , assuming slab and cylindrical jets , respectively , with axial magnetic fields , have focused on the comparison of the scale - length of the structures generated during the nonlinear evolution and the wavelengths of maximum growth rate predicted by the linear theory .",
    "they find that the jet is not stabilized by nonlinear effects associated with increasing magnetic tension and disrupts near the @xmath17 wavelength of the k - h kink mode .",
    "malagoli , bodo & rosner ( 1996 ) and min ( 1997a , b ) have extended those investigations of the nonlinear development of the k - h instability by including diffusion and magnetic reconnection effects and found that even if the magnetic field intensity is not too large to completely suppress the k - h instability , it is still able to mediate turbulence decay and diffusion of energy and mass across the boundary layer between jet and surrounding medium .    these studies of the stability properties of the beam against mhd k - h pinch and helical modes seem to provide potential mechanisms to explain the formation of structures such as knots and wiggles in adiabatic , supermagnetosonic light jets . besides these stability analyses",
    ", some effort has also been spent in numerical studies of the general effects of @xmath18-fields on the global evolution and morphology of adiabatic , light jets , still in the context of extragalactic jets , assuming both passive ( clarke , norman & burns 1989 ; matthews & scheuer 1990 ; hardee & norman 1990 ) and dynamical important toroidal fields ( e.g. , clarke , norman & burns 1986 ; lind et al . 1989 ; kssl , mller & hillebrandt 1990 ) . in the later case ,",
    "the jet was found to be rapidly decelerated at the mach disk with the shocked jet material being confined to a slender trans - alfvnic plug instead of being deposited in the large cocoon observed in the purely hd light jets .",
    "lately , these numerical mhd studies have been extended to heavy , adiabatic jets ( todo et al . 1993 ; hardee & clarke 1995 ; stone , xu & hardee 1997 ) .",
    "hardee & clarke and stone et al . have focused on simulations of jets with a poloidal field propagating into an unmagnetized medium , while todo et al .",
    "( see also thiele & camenzind 1997 ) have considered a helical field configuration extending also to the ambient medium . comparing the development of supermagnetosonic , adiabatic , heavy jets with axial and toroidal magnetic fields propagating into unmagnetized ambient media , hardee & stone ( 1997 ) have found that the toroidal geometry suppresses the mixing and entrainment of ambient gas which is found to develop in the axial case as a consequence of the k - h instability .",
    "also , they have found that the kink mode has a longer wavelength and smaller amplitude in the toroidal configuration .    still almost unexplored , however , is the role played by @xmath19-fields on the propagation dynamics and morphology of radiatively cooling , heavy jets ( a scenario which is believed to occur in protostellar jets ) . in the limit of zero magnetic field , numerical simulations of radiatively cooling , heavy jets [ e.g. , blondin , fryxell and knigl 1990 , hereafter bfk ; de gouveia dal pino & benz 1993 , hereafter gb93 ; stone & norman 1993a , 1993b , 1994 ; de gouveia dal pino & benz 1994 , hereafter gb94 ; chernin et al .",
    "1994 ; de gouveia dal pino , birkinshaw & benz 1996 , hereafter gbb96 ; de gouveia dal pino & birkinshaw 1996 ( gb96 ) ] have shown that thermal energy losses by the jet system have important effects on its dynamics .",
    "these studies have revealed that a cooling jet develops a dense , cold shell of shocked material at the head which is fragmented into clumps by rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "moreover , bfk and gb93 have found that the development of the k - h modes along the beam are inhibited by the presence of cooling .",
    "recently , hardee & stone ( 1997 ) and stone , xu & hardee ( 1997 ) ( see also massaglia et al .",
    "1992 ) have examined the dynamics of k - h unstable cooling jets .",
    "their linear analysis indicate that the growth of the k - h modes is very sensitive to the assumed form of the cooling function .",
    "in particular , if the cooling curve is a steep function of the temperature in the neighborhood of the equilibrium state , then the growth of k - h modes is reduced relative to the adiabatic jet - a result which is consistent with previous numerical simulations ( bfk ; gb93 ) . with the inclusion of a longitudinal magnetic field in a supermagnetosonic jet ,",
    "hardee & stone ( 1997 ) find that the magnetic field does not strongly impact the differences in the k - h stability properties between an adiabatic and a cooling hd jet , provided that the magnetic pressure does not dominate . besides , they find that the increase in the magnetic field strength makes the linear stability properties to become more like those of an adiabatic jet .",
    "the nonlinear analysis of the growth of the k - h modes in cooling jets in the @xmath20 limit shows similar behaviour as in the pure adiabatic cases .",
    "the jet can disrupt near the resonant frequency of the fundamental kink k - h mode , and nonlinear , higher frequency , reflection waves tend to produce low - amplitude wiggles , and can result in strong shocks in the jet beam .",
    "in the present work , we attempt to extend these previous investigations by exploring the nonlinear effects of magnetic fields ( close to equipartition with the gas ) on the global evolution and morphology of radiatively cooling , heavy jets and test the morphological signatures of two different magnetic field geometries ( a longitudinal and a helical configuration ) on the dynamics of protostellar jets .",
    "a preliminary step in this direction was made in previous work ( de gouveia dal pino & cerqueira 1996 ; cerqueira , de gouveia dal pino & herant 1997 , hereafter paper i ) , where we have mainly focused on the effects of the magnetic fields in the jet @xmath21 structure . with the help of three - dimensional ( 3-d ) smooth particle magnetohydrodynamical ( spmhd ) simulations , we have found that the presence of a helical magnetic field ( in close equipartition with the gas ) may suppress the formation of the clumpy structure that is found to develop at the head of hd jets by fragmentation of the cold shell of shocked jet material .",
    "a cooling jet immersed in a longitudinal magnetic field , on the other hand , tends to retain the clumpy morphology at its head . in the present work",
    ", we perform 3-d spmhd simulations to address the details of the magnetic field effects over the whole structure of the radiatively cooling , heavy jets , covering a more extensive range of parameters , and compare with both non - magnetic and adiabatic systems .    contemporaneously with this work , frank et al .",

    "1997 ) have performed grid - based 2@xmath22-d simulations of magnetized , radiatively cooling jets assuming a toroidal ( @xmath23 ) magnetic field and concluded that toroidal fields are able to excite the development of strong pinches along the beam .",
    "although in our simulations we have assumed somewhat different initial conditions ( see below ) , where both investigations overlap , the results are qualitatively similar , except for the fact that in our simulations the mhd pinch modes are found to be not strong in radiatively cooling , heavy jets .",
    "this difference , however , is mainly due to differences in the assumed initial density ratios between the jet and the ambient medium , which are much larger in our analyses ( see paper i and discussion below ) .    in  2 , the numerical method and",
    "the initial conditions used are briefly described . in ",
    "3 , we present the results of our simulations , and in  4 , we address the conclusions and the possible implications of our results .",
    "in our simulations , we consider the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) conservation equations in the ideal approximation    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where the symbols have their usual meaning ( i.e. , @xmath28 is the density ; @xmath18 is the magnetic field ; @xmath29 is the specific internal energy , @xmath30 is the radiative cooling rate , etc . ) . to close the system ( 1 ) , an ideal equation of state",

    "the mhd equations above are solved ( in cartesian coordinates ) using a modified version of the fully three - dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code originally developed by de gouveia dal pino & benz ( 1993 ) ( see also gb94 ; chernin et al .",
    "1994 ; gb96 ; gbb96 ) for the investigation of the evolution of purely hydrodynamic ( hd ) jets .    in the sph formalism , equations ( 1 ) are described by ( e.g. , benz 1990 ; stellingwerf & peterkin 1990 ; monaghan 1992 ; meglicki 1995 ) :    @xmath33 @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the mass of the particle @xmath38 ( located at the position @xmath39 ) ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density of the particles @xmath42 and @xmath38 , respectively ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 are their pressure ; @xmath45 is the magnetic field at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the @xmath48 component of @xmath45 ) ; @xmath49 is the velocity difference , and @xmath50 is @xmath48 component of @xmath51 .",

    "the term @xmath53 is the gradient of the kernel function @xmath54 at the position of the particle @xmath42 , and @xmath55 is the artificial viscosity which allows for appropriate treatment of shock wave dissipation .",
    "we here adopt the von neumann - richtmyer viscosity ( e.g. , benz 1990 ) .",
    "the density and pressure are both calculated from the definition of discretness in sph ( e.g. , benz 1990 ; monaghan 1992 ) , and are expressed , respectively , by the equations :    @xmath56    @xmath57    as in previous work ( gb93 ; gb94 ; gb96 ) , the radiative cooling rate ( due to collisional excitation and recombination ) @xmath30 in equation ( 1c ) , is implicitly calculated using the cooling function evaluated by katz ( 1989 ) for a gas of cosmic abundances cooling from from @xmath58 k to @xmath59 k. [ the cooling is suppressed below @xmath60 k , where the transfer of ionizing radiation becomes important , and the assumption of a fully ionized flow breaks down ( see , e.g. , gb93 ; gbb96 ) ] .",
    "the choice of a _ vectorial _ formalism to write the system of equations above ( instead of a tensorial form ) is to ensure that the magnetic force vector [ ( @xmath61)@xmath62 , in each point of the system , is strictly perpendicular to the magnetic field vector itself .",
    "tensorial implementations in spmhd , like those proposed by monaghan ( 1992 ) , are subject to the development of non - physical components of the magnetic force , whose projection on the magnetic field vector has non - zero values",

    "2 , imply that , within the head of the jet , the ambient shocked gas is almost adiabatic , whereas the shocked jet material is subject to rapid radiative cooling .",
    "the corresponding density contours and velocity field distribution maps of the models above were presented in figs . 1 and 2 of paper",
    "i , where they were also compared with a pure hydrodynamical model ( hd3r ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "as we have stressed in paper i , the cold dense shell that develops at the jet head due to the cooling of the shock - heated jet material in the pure hydrodynamical case , also appears in the mhd jets .",
    "similarly , it becomes rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) unstable ( e.g. , gb93 ) and breaks into blobs that spill into the cocoon and show a resemblance with the herbig - haro objects which are observed at the head of protostellar jets .",
    "as in the hd case , the density in the shell of the mhd jets also undergoes fluctuations with time which are caused by _ global thermal instabilities _ of the radiative shock ( see e.g. , gaetz , edgar & chevalier 1988 and gb93 and for details ) .",
    "3 shows the time evolution of the shell density ( @xmath125 ) variations at the jet axis of the three jets , which have a period of the order of the gas cooling time ( @xmath126 years , or @xmath127 , where @xmath128 years corresponds to the transverse jet dynamical time ) .",
    "we note that although the hd and the mhd jets attain a maximum density of approximately the same magnitude at @xmath129 , later on the density enhancement in the mhd jets is inhibited by the presence of the * b*-field , particularly in the jet with helical field ( mh3r ) .",
    "2 indicates that the cold blobs that develop from shell fragmentation at the head of the mhd jets detach from the beam as they are expelled backward to the cocoon .",
    "the survival of these blobs in the cocoon seems to suffer with the presence of the magnetic fields , particularly in the helical case .",
    "compared to the blobs of the hd jet , their density is reduced by a factor @xmath130 in the longitudinal case ( ml3r ) at the final time step ( @xmath131 ) , and almost vanishes in the helical jet ( mh3r ) . fig .",
    "4 compares the density and pressure profiles across the flow in three different positions along the mhd jets in the head region .",
    "the lateral blobs that develop in the cocoon , on both sides of the beam are clearly less intense in the helical case than in the longitudinal case . in the helical case , for example ,",
    "we find that the toroidal ( nonparallel - to - shock ) component of the magnetic field , which is initially less intense than the longitudinal component ( by a factor @xmath132 2.5 ) , is strongly amplified by compression in the shocks at the head ( by a factor @xmath133 ) .",
    "as pointed out in paper i ,",
    "this amplification increases the cooling length behind the jet shock and reduces the density growth . as a consequence",
    ", the shell tends to stabilize against the r - t instability and the clump formation is inhibited . at the end of the evolution , the dense shell with clumpy structure which was observed to develop in the head region of the pure hd jet ( fig .",
    "1 of paper i ) is replaced in the helical case by an elongated plug ( fig .",
    "2 ) of low density material .    fig .",
    "2 also indicates the development of some pinching along both mhd jets . in the pure hd case",
    ", constriction occurs only very close to the jet head where the beam is over - confined by the gas pressure of the cocoon ( see figs . 1 and 2 of paper i ; see also fig .",
    "5b below ) . in the mhd jet with helical field ( mh3r ) , the toroidal component ( @xmath23 ) , which is amplified by compression in the shocks at the head ,",
    "is advected back with the shocked material to the cocoon . the associated magnetic pressure ( @xmath134 )",
    "causes an increase in the total pressure of the cocoon relative to the pure hd case , which collimates the beam and excites the ( fastest growing ) small - wavelength pinch modes of the mhd k - h instability .",
    "these modes over - confine the beam and drive the approximately equally spaced internal shocks seen in the mh3r jet ( fig .",
    "2 ; bottom ) . along the mhd jet with longitudinal field",
    "( ml3r ; fig .",
    "2 ; top ) , the increase in the total confining pressure of the cocoon also drives the development of the mhd k - h instabilities which excite beam pinching and internal shocks .",
    "consistent with linear theory for k - h modes , in the supermagnetosonic regime considered here , they begin to appear at a distance @xmath135 , which is smaller than in the pure hd jet ( see tabel 1 ) .",
    "the presence of these oblique internal shocks along the beam of the mhd jets can be testfied by the density and pressure profiles across and along the flow depicted in fig . 5 , where the pure hd model is also depicted for comparison .",
    "we see that the induced internal shocks in the mhd cases have a density contrast @xmath136 in the ml3r model ( middle ) and @xmath137 in the mh3r model ( or @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , where @xmath125 is the density at the shell ) .",
    "we also note a close correlation between the pinching zones and the appearance of more intense reversed fields in the contact discontinuity between the jet and the cocoon .",
    "in both magnetic field configurations , the original longitudinal components are reoriented in the nonparallel shocks at the head and advected back to the cocoon . as a consequence ,",
    "a predominantly toroidal current density distribution ( @xmath140 ) develops around the jet .",
    "such configuration creates a @xmath141 force ( @xmath142 ) that constricts the beam triggering the mhd pinch formation .",
    "6 depicts the density in the midplane section of the head of three supermagnetosonic , radiatively cooling jets with @xmath143 after they have propagated over a distance @xmath144 : a purely hd model hd10r ( top ) , an mhd model with initial longitudinal magnetic field configuration , ml10r ( middle ) , and an mhd model with initial helical magnetic field configuration mh10r ( bottom ) .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the time evolution of the corresponding velocity and magnetic field distributions .",
    "the other initial conditions are the same as in fig .",
    "2 . for the time evolution",
    "depicted , there is no significant difference between the mhd jets with different @xmath5 other than those presented by their pure hd counterparts . in both hd and mhd cases , the jet with larger @xmath5 [ and thus with @xmath145 plows into the ambient medium almost ballistically without accumulating much waste of shocked jet gas in the cocoon .",
    "the shocked ambient material is almost adiabatic ( @xmath146 ; see table 1 ) and accumulates in the shroud that envelops the cocoon / beam , while the shocked jet material cools much faster ( @xmath147 ) and the shock is effectively isothermal .",
    "the cold shell is thus much thinner in the larger @xmath5 jets and the head resembles a bullet .    as in the @xmath148 case",
    ", the density in the shell of the @xmath143 jets also undergoes variations with time ( with a period of the order of the jet radiative cooling time ) which are caused by the global thermal instabilities of the radiative shocks . likewise , after reaching a similar maximum density amplitude , the mhd jets have their shell density growth inhibited due to the decrease of the shock compressibility caused by the presence of the * b*-field , particularly in the jet with helical field ( mh10r ) .",
    "we note , however , that in the hd jet , the shell density variations attain a smaller maximum density amplitude than in the mhd cases .",
    "this is possibly due to the smaller total pressure confinement that acts on its head .    in the @xmath143 mhd jets ( ml10r and mh10r ) ,",
    "the increase in the total confining pressure in the cocoon ( due to the presence of the magnetic field ) also over - confines the beam , relative to the hd jet , and drives some beam pinching .",
    "9a shows the density and pressure profiles across the flow in different pinch positions along the mhd and hd @xmath149 jets after they have propagated over a distance @xmath150 ( at @xmath131 ) , which can be compared with fig . 5 ( for @xmath148 ) .",
    "as in the @xmath148 models , the pinch collimation is larger in the helical mh10r jet than in the ml10r jet , while the pure hydrodynamic jet , hd10r , has not developed any internal pinches over the time scale depicted .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the mhd jets , the fastest - growing pinch modes of the k - h instability would be expected to appear only at distances @xmath151 , which are beyond the computed scales .",
    "thus the early development of pinches in these cases , is possibly being triggered mainly by the hydromagnetic @xmath152-pinch effect ( e.g. , boyd & sanderson 1961 ; cohn 1983 ) . as in the @xmath148 case ,",
    "the jet with longitudinal b - field also develops a non - axisymmetric helical ( kink ) mode close to the head of the jet which causes some beam twisting .",
    "as expected , after propagating about the same distance , the pinches that develop in the larger @xmath5 case are less numerous , since the total amount of confining shocked material that deposits into the cocoon is comparatively smaller ( see figs . 5 and 9 for a comparison ) .",
    "nonetheless , the density contrasts , @xmath153 , attained in the pinch regions of the mhd jet with longitudinal field , ml10r ( @xmath154 , or @xmath155 ) are approximately the same as those in the smaller @xmath5 jet ( ml3r ) .",
    "the situation is a little more complex for the mhd jets with helical field . over the whole jet evolution ,",
    "some few pinches are found to be stronger in the larger @xmath5 jet ( mh10r ) ( fig .",
    "8) , but in general the density contrasts are approximately the same in both cases ( @xmath156 , or @xmath157 ) .",
    "10 depicts the density in the midplane section of the head of three supermagnetosonic , @xmath158 jets with @xmath148 : a purely hd jet ( hd3a , top ) , an mhd jet with initial longitudinal @xmath18-field , ( ml3a , middle ) , and an mhd jet with initial helical @xmath18-field ( mh3a , bottom ) .",
    "figures 11 and 12 show the time evolution of the corresponding velocity and magnetic field distributions .",
    "the initial conditions are the same as in fig . 2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "previous numerical analyses comparing pure hd jets with and without radiative cooling ( e.g. , bfk , gb93 ) have shown that the presence of radiative cooling tends to reduce the strength and number of internal shocks excited by k - h instability .",
    "consistently , the hd3a jet in figs . 10 - 12 reveals the appearance of a pinching zone ( at @xmath159 ) which is absent in its radiatively cooling counterpart ( hd3r , fig .",
    "2 ; see also figs . 1 and 2 of paper i ) . besides , the beam constriction which appears close to the head is larger in the adiabatic jet ( hd3a ) .",
    "these results are also compatible with the predictions of the linear stability theory ( hardee & stone 1997 ) , when applied in the context of the cooling function employed in this work ( see  1 ) .",
    "similarly , the pinches which develop in the mhd adiabatic jets ( figs .",
    "10 - 12 ) are generally more intense and numerous than in the radiatively cooling counterparts of fig .",
    "their larger strength can be testified by direct comparison of figs .",
    "13 and 5 which show the transverse profiles of some pinches along the jets . in particular",
    ", for the ml3a jet , we find a chain of 8 evolving pinches , at @xmath131 , against 5 in the radiatively cooling jet ( ml3r ) , and the corresponding densities @xmath153 , are about 2 to 3 times greater than in the ml3r jet .",
    "the helical adiabatic jet mh3a displays pinches that are 40% denser than those found in the radiatively cooling jet ( mh3r ) at @xmath131 .",
    "we find similar results when comparing radiatively cooling and adiabatic jets with larger @xmath5 .",
    "figure 14 shows the midplane density ( left ) and velocity field distribution ( right ) for _ adiabatic _ jets with @xmath143 after they have propagated @xmath160 , with the same initial conditions as the cooling jets of figures 6 , 7 , and 8 . the corresponding magnetic field distribution is presented in fig .",
    "15 . as before",
    ", the @xmath143 adiabatic jet with longitudinal @xmath19-field ( ml10a ) develops stronger pinches than its cooling counterpart ( ml10r model ) by a factor @xmath161 .",
    "the @xmath162 , adiabatic helical jet ( mh10a ) , on the other hand , has pinches with densities of the same order of magnitude as those in the cooling jet ( mh10r ) .",
    "also , the pinches are found to be stronger in the adiabatic jets with smaller @xmath5 , in both magnetic field configurations .",
    "we have investigated here the effects of magnetic fields on the structure of evolving overdense , radiatively cooling , supermagnetosonic jets with the help of 3-d spmhd simulations and compared with purely hydrodynamical and adiabatic calculations .",
    "two initial magnetic field configurations ( with magnitude in approximate equipartition with the gas ) have been examined : a longitudinal , and a helical field permeating both the jet and the ambient medium . calculated for a set of parameters which are particularly appropriate to protostellar jets ( with density ratios between the jet and the ambient medium @xmath163 , and ambient mach number @xmath1 ) ,",
    "our results indicate that magnetic fields have important effects on the dynamics of radiatively cooling jets .",
    "both magnetic field geometries are able to improve jet collimation relative to the pure hydrodynamical ( hd ) jets , but this effect is larger in the helical field case .",
    "as we have stressed in paper i , the cold dense shell that develops at the jet head due to the cooling of the shock - heated jet material in the hd cases , also appears in the mhd jets .",
    "likewise , it becomes rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) unstable and breaks into clumps which are more visible in the smaller @xmath5 jets where the developed shell is thicker .",
    "also as in the hd case , the shell of the mhd jets undergoes density variations with time which are caused by global thermal instabilities of the radiative shocks .",
    "however the amplification and re - orientation of the nonparallel components of the magnetic fields by the shocks at the head , particularly in the helical field geometry , reduces the postshock compressibility and increases the postshock cooling length .",
    "this tends to stabilize the shell against both the r - t and the thermal instabilities . as a consequence ,",
    "the clumps that are observed to develop by fragmentation of the shell in the hd jets are depleted in the helical field geometry .",
    "the jet immersed in the longitudinal field , on the other hand , still retains the clumps although they have their densities decreased relative to the the hd counterparts . the fact that the clumpy shell structure resembles the knotty pattern of the herbig - haro objects which are commonly observed at the head of protostellar jets ( e.g. , herbig & jones 1981 ; brugel et al .",
    "1985 ; reipurth 1989 ; heathcote et al . 1996 ) suggests that a longitudinal magnetic field geometry would be more likely in the outer regions of these jets than a helical field geometry ( see also paper i ) .    over the computed time and",
    "length scales , internal oblique shocks along the beam are not found to develop in the hd systems examined here . on the other hand , in their mhd counterparts with both magnetic field configurations ,",
    "the confining total pressure of the cocoon excites ( the fastest growing ) low - amplitude mhd k - h reflection pinching modes which drive a chain of approximately equally spaced internal shocks along the beam , but these shocks are found to be slightly stronger in the helical field case ( by a factor @xmath164 20% ) .",
    "also , as expected , the internal shocks tend to appear in a larger number in the smaller @xmath5 jets ( due to the larger amount of confining shocked material which is deposited in the cocoon ) , although their densities are approximately of the same magnitude as those in the larger @xmath5 jets .",
    "a non - axisymmetric helical mode is also excited close to the head of the radiatively cooling mhd jets with longitudinal field , which causes some beam wiggling .",
    "the number and strength of the internal shocks excited in the mhd adiabatic jets is larger than in the radiatively cooling counterparts ( by a factor @xmath165 in both number and strength ) .",
    "this result is compatible with the linear stability theory ( hardee & stone 1997 ) when applied in the context of the cooling function employed in the present work , and is also compatible with previous numerical work of hd jets which has shown that the presence of radiative cooling tends to reduce the strength and number of internal shocks along the jet ( e.g. , bfk ; gb93 ) .",
    "also , the pinches are found to be more numerous in the adiabatic jets with smaller @xmath5 , in both magnetic field configurations .",
    "the internal shocks are found to propagate downstream with velocities close to that of the jet head ( @xmath166 km s@xmath114 ) .",
    "the mean distance between them ( @xmath167 ) is in agreement with the observed knots in the jets .",
    "however , the weakness of the shocks in the radiatively cooling jets ( @xmath168 ) makes it doubtful that they could produce by themselves the bright knots observed in protostellar jets .",
    "probably , other mechanisms , like intermittency in the jet injection velocity , play a more relevant role in knot formation in those jets ( see e.g. , raga et al .",
    "1990 ; de gouveia dal pino and benz 1994 ; stone and norman 1993a ) .",
    "we should note that in the recent numerical study of magnetized radiatively cooling jets by frank et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , they have found that toroidal fields ( also in approximate equipartition with the gas ) may excite the development of strong pinches along the beam .",
    "this apparent contradiction between their analysis and ours is possibly due to differences in the assumed initial conditions .",
    "frank et al .",
    "have considered a slower and much lighter jet ( with a jet mach number @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) than the cases examined here ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) .",
    "thus , consistently with our results above , their smaller @xmath5 jet should be expected to produce a larger amount of more intense pinches .",
    "this result has also been confirmed by numerical simulations ( not presented here ) that we have performed of @xmath173 jets , which have produced a larger amount of pinches with slightly larger densities than the larger @xmath5 jets studied above .",
    "finally , we should make some remarks on the late evolution of the radiatively cooling magnetized jets . in the magnetic field maps of figs . 2 , and 8 above",
    ", we have detected the development of ( sometimes strong ) magnetic field reversals at the contact discontinuity between the jet and the cocoon with intensities up to 5 times their initial magnitude . as stressed in  3",
    ", field reversals occur in both investigated magnetic field configurations , because the field lines are amplified by compression in the nonparallel shocks at the jet head , and are enforced to flow backward with the shocked plasma into the cocoon . in this process ,",
    "the lines are reoriented and sometimes have their polarization reversed . beyond the integrated length and time scales depicted in the figures above , however , the increasing strength of the reversed fields due to shear at the contact discontinuity ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "2c ) , may lead to the development of strong pinching regions which ultimately may cause jet disruption , particularly in the cases with longitudinal field . as an example , fig .",
    "16 depicts the time evolution of the velocity ( left ) and magnetic field ( right ) distributions of a disruption zone which occured in the late evolution of the ml3r jet of fig .",
    "2 . we can clearly distinguish two regions with reversed * b*-fields whose strength increases with time , which are correlated with developing pinches .",
    "the inner constriction becomes so strong that it finally causes the disruption of the beam .",
    "although shear and compression are expected to enhance * b * , this amplification is possibly partially due to numerical effects .",
    "in fact , along a contact discontinuity with such a magnetic field topology with oppositely directed field lines pressed together , magnetic diffusion and reconnection may have an important role and lead to intense magnetic energy release .",
    "of course , under the ideal - mhd approach considered here , these dissipation effects of the magnetic field have not been appropriately considered thus leading to possibly anomalous amplification of the reversed components in the late stages of the evolution of some of the jets .",
    "further , we should note also that no jet disruption was detected in the majority of the adiabatic cases .",
    "this fact is consistent with recent numerical studies of reconnection processes in 2-d current sheets ( oreshina & somov 1998 ) , which have shown that reconnection rates are smaller in adiabatic than in radiatively cooling plasmas .",
    "although the transposition of these results to the more complex flow geometry we have investigated here is not straightforward , they seem to suggest that the appropriate consideration of magnetic field dissipation in our models will possibly decrease and even suppress the disruptive effects of the magnetic fields found in some of the radiatively cooling cases examined here in their late evolution .",
    "the transformation of magnetic energy into thermal energy of the gas will probably have important effects on the structure and emission mechanisms of the beam ( see e.g. , malagoli , bodo & rosner 1996 ; min 1997a , b ; jones et al .",
    "1997 ) and also in the process of turbulent mixing of the jet and cocoon material .",
    "such finite magnetic resistivity effects will be addressed in a forthcoming paper . besides",
    ", the potential signatures that magnetic fields may leave on the morphology of radiative cooling jets , especially behind the shocks , provide important constraints that can be used in future observational tests to distinguish among different candidate mechanisms for emission line production , jet collimation , and turbulent entrainment at the contact discontinuity between the jet and the cocoon .",
