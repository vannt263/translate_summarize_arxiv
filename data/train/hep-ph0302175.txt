    "these authors also observed that the subsequent annihilation of @xmath1 pairs would heat the photons but not the decoupled neutrinos , so by conservation of entropy @xmath2 would decrease from its high temperature value of unity , down to @xmath3 at @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "subsequently , chiu & morrison @xcite found the rate for @xmath11 in a plasma to be @xmath12 for the universal fermi interaction and zeldovich @xcite equated this to the hubble expansion rate in the radiation - dominated era , @xmath13 where @xmath14 counts the relativistic degrees of freedom , to obtain the ` decoupling ' temperature below which the neutrinos expand freely without further interactions as @xmath15 .",

    "interestingly enough , some years earlier pontecorvo & smorodinski @xcite had discussed the bounds set on the cosmological energy density of mev energy neutrinos ( created e.g. by large - scale matter - antimatter annihilation ) using data from the reines  cowan and davis experiments . )",
    "not surprisingly these bounds were rather weak so these authors stated somewhat prophetically that ``  it is not possible to exclude a priori the possibility that the neutrino and antineutrino energy density in the universe is comparable to or larger than the average energy density contained in the proton rest mass '' .",
    "zeldovich & smorodinski @xcite noted that better bounds can be set by the limit on the cosmological energy density in any form of matter @xmath24 ) following from the observed present expansion rate @xmath25 and age @xmath26 of the universe . where the hubble parameter @xmath27 , so the present hubble age is @xmath28 .",
    "] of course they were still discussing _ massless _ neutrinos .",
    "weinberg @xcite even speculated whether a degenerate sea of relic neutrinos can saturate the cosmological energy density bound and noted that such a sea may be detectable by searching for ( scattering ) events beyond the end - point of the kurie plot in @xmath29-decay experiments .",
    "several years later , gershten & zeldovich @xcite made the connection that if relic neutrinos are massive , then a bound on the mass follows from simply requiring that @xmath30 using the general relativistic constraint @xmath31 , they derived @xmath32 ( just assuming that @xmath33 , i.e. that the universe is older than the earth ) and inferred that @xmath34  ev for a present photon temperature of @xmath35 .",
    "their calculation of the relic neutrino abundance was rather approximate  they adopted @xmath36 i.e. assumed massive neutrinos to be dirac particles with fully populated right - handed ( rh ) states ( even though they commented _ en passim _ that according to the @xmath37 theory such states are non - interacting and would thus not be in equilibrium at @xmath38 ) and moreover they did not allow for the decrease in the neutrino temperature relative to photons due to @xmath22 annihilation .",
    "nevertheless their bound was competitive with the best laboratory bound on @xmath39 and @xmath40 times better than that on @xmath41 , demonstrating the sensitivity ( if not the precision ! ) of cosmological arguments .",
    "a better bound of @xmath42  ev was quoted by marx & szalay @xcite who numerically integrated the cosmological friedmann equation from @xmath19 decoupling down to the present epoch , subject to the condition @xmath43 .",
    "independently cowsik & mcclleland @xcite used direct limits on @xmath44 and @xmath45 to obtain an even more restrictive bound of @xmath46  ev , assuming that @xmath47 ; however they too assumed that @xmath48 and that rh states were fully populated .",
    "as shapiro , teukolsky & wasserman @xcite first emphasized , even if massive neutrinos are dirac rather than majorana , the rh states have no gauge interactions so should have decoupled much earlier than the left - handed ones",

    "_ can _ generate rh states , this can be neglected for @xmath49 .",
    "even if rh neutrinos have new ( superweak ) interactions , their relic abundance can be no more than @xmath50 of lh neutrinos so the bound on their mass ( [ mnu ] ) is relaxed to @xmath51  kev @xcite .",
    "even if the ( post - inflationary ) universe was not hot enough to bring such interactions into equilibrium , a cosmologically interesting abundance can still be generated if the rh states have small mixings with lh states @xcite .",
    "] thus we arrive at the modern version of the ` gershten - zeldovich ' bound @xcite : the conservative limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 imply @xmath54 i.e. @xmath55 @xcite ; combining this with the relic neutrino number density , which is @xmath56 larger @xcite than in eq.([nnu ] ) , gives : for @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "@xmath63 this is a rather conservative bound since galaxy surveys indicate much tighter constraints on the total amount of gravitating ( dark ) matter in the universe , e.g. the observed ` redshift space distortion ' @xcite suggests @xmath64 , averaged over a volume extending several hundred mpc .",
    "together with the hubble key project determination of @xmath65 @xcite , this implies that the sum of all neutrino masses can not exceed about 15  ev .",
    "although this has historically been the most restrictive constraint on neutrino masses , it is no longer competetive with the direct laboratory bound on the electron neutrino mass from the mainz and troitsk tritium @xmath29-decay experiments @xcite : @xmath66 although the kinematic mass limits on the other neutrino flavours are much weaker ( viz .",
    "@xmath67  kev , @xmath68  mev @xcite ) , the bound above now applies in fact to _ all _ eigenstates @xcite given the rather small mass - differences indicated by the oscillation interpretation of the solar ( @xmath69 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath70 ) neutrino anomalies @xcite .",
    "this means that the laboratory limit on the sum of neutrino masses ( for comparison with the new cosmological bounds to be discussed ) is presently 6.6 ev ; the sensitivity of planned future experiments is at the ev level @xcite .",
    "moreover relic neutrinos contribute at least @xmath71 to the cosmic budget ( assuming a mass hierarchy ) , nearly as much as visible baryons @xcite .",
    "the cosmological bound ( [ mnu ] ) assumes conservatively that neutrinos constitute _ all _ of the ( dark ) matter permitted by the dynamics of the universal hubble expansion .",
    "further constraints must be satisfied if they are to cluster on a specified scale ( e.g. galactic halos or galaxy clusters ) and provide the dark matter whose presence is inferred from dynamical measurements .",
    "cowsik & mcclleland @xcite were the first to suggest that neutrinos with a mass of a few ev could naturally be the ` missing mass ' in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this follows from the relation @xmath72 ( reflecting the pauli principle ) which they obtained by modeling a cluster of mass @xmath73 as a square potential well of core radius @xmath74 filled with a fermi - dirac gas of neutrinos at zero temperature .",
    "subsequently tremaine & gunn @xcite noted that this provides a _ lower _ bound on the neutrino mass . although the microscopic phase - space density ( [ fnu ] ) is conserved for collisionless particles , the ` coarse - grained ' phase - space density in bound objects can decrease below its maximum value of @xmath75 during structure formation .",
    "modeling the bound system as an isothermal sphere with velocity dispersion @xmath76 and core radius @xmath77 then gives @xmath78 this is indeed consistent with the cosmological upper bound ( [ mnu ] ) down to the scale of galaxies , however there is a conflict for smaller objects , viz .",
    "dwarf galaxies which require a _ minimum _ mass of @xmath79  ev @xcite .",
    "in fact the central phase space density of observed dark matter cores in these structures decreases rapidly with increasing core radius , rather than being constant as would be expected for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "moreover since neutrinos would cluster more efficiently in larger potential wells , there should be a trend of increasing mass - to - light ratio with scale .",
    "this was indeed claimed to be the case initially @xcite but later it was recognised that the actual increase is far less than expected @xcite .",
    "thus massive neutrinos are now disfavoured as the constituent of the ` missing mass ' in galaxies and clusters .",
    "nevertheless such cosmological arguments became of particular interest in the 1980 s after the itep tritium @xmath29-decay experiment claimed a @xmath80  ev mass for the electron neutrino .",
    "the attention of cosmologists turned to how the large - scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies , clusters and superclusters would have formed if the universe is indeed dominated by such massive neutrinos .",
    "the basic picture @xcite is that structure grows through gravitational instability from primordial density perturbations ; these perturbations were first detected by the _ cosmic background explorer _",
    "( cobe ) via the temperature fluctuations they induce in the cmb @xcite . on small scales ( @xmath81 )",
    "structure formation is complicated by non - linear gravitational clustering as well as non - gravitational ( gas dynamic ) processes but on large scales gravitational dynamics is linear and provides a robust probe of the nature of the dark matter .",
    "density perturbations in a medium composed of relativistic collisionless particles are subject to a form of landau damping ( viz .",
    "phase - mixing through free streaming of particles from high to low density regions ) which effectively erases perturbations on scales smaller than the free - streaming length @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the ( comoving ) distance traversed by a neutrino from the big bang until it becomes non - relativistic , and corresponds to the scale of superclusters of galaxies .",
    "thus huge neutrino condensations ( generically in the shape of ` pancakes ' ) , containing a mass @xmath83 , would have begun growing at a redshift @xmath84 when the universe became matter - dominated and gravitational instability set in .",
    "this is well before the epoch of ( re)combination at @xmath85 so the baryons were still closely coupled to the photons , while the neutrinos were mildly relativistic ( @xmath86 ) hence ` hot ' .",
    "after the universe became neutral , baryonic matter would have accreted into these potential wells , forming a thin layer of gas in the central plane of the pancakes .",
    "thus superclusters would be the first objects to condense out of the hubble flow in a ` hot dark matter ' ( hdm ) cosmogony , and smaller structures such as galaxies would form only later through the fragmentation of the pancakes .",
    "the gross features of such a ` top - down ' model for structure formation are compatible with several observed features of lss , in particular the distinctive ` voids ' and ` filaments ' seen in large galaxy surveys .",
    "it was also noted that since primordial density perturbations can begin growing earlier than in an purely baryonic universe , their initial amplitude must have been smaller , consistent with extant limits on the isotropy of the microwave background .",
    "detailed studies @xcite found however that galaxies form too late through the breakup of the pancakes , at a redshift @xmath87 , counter to observations of galaxies and quasars at @xmath88 .",
    "( another way of saying this is that galaxies should have formed _",
    "last _ in an hdm universe , whereas our galaxy is in fact dynamically much older than the local group @xcite . )",
    "there are other difficulties such as too high ` peculiar ' ( i.e. non - hubble ) velocities @xcite , excessive x - ray emission from baryons which accrete onto neutrino clusters @xcite , and too large voids @xcite ( although detailed simulations @xcite showed later that some of these problems had perhaps been exaggerated ) .",
    "therefore cosmologists abandoned hdm and turned , with considerably more success , to cold dark matter ( cdm ) , i.e. particles which were non - relativistic at the epoch of matter - domination @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of cdm universes gave excellent agreement with observations of galaxy clustering and a ` standard cdm ' model for large - scale structure formation was established , viz .",
    "a critical density cdm dominated universe with an initially scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations @xcite . moreover particle physicists provided plausible candidate particles , notably the neutralino in supersymmetric models with conserved @xmath89-parity which naturally has a relic abundance of order the critical density @xcite .",
    "nevertheless neutrinos were resuscitated some years later as a possible ( sub - dominant ) component of the dark matter when the cdm cosmogony itself ran into problems . to appreciate the background to this it is necessary to recapitulate the essential ingredients of a model for cosmic structure formation . a key assumption made concerns the nature of the primordial density perturbations which grow through gravitational instability in the dark matter .",
    "cosmologists usually assume such fluctuations to have a power spectrum of the _ scale - free _ form : @xmath90 with @xmath91 corresponding to the scale - invariant ` harrison - zeldovich ' spectrum . here",
    "@xmath92 is the fourier transform of spatial fluctuations in the density field ( of wavelength @xmath93 ) .",
    "moreover the perturbations are assumed to be gaussian ( i.e. different phases in the plane - wave expansion are uncorrelated ) and to be ` adiabatic ' ( i.e. matter and radiation fluctuate together ) . concurrent with the above studies concerning the nature of the dark matter , powerful support for this conjecture was provided by the development of the ` inflationary universe ' model @xcite . here",
    "the perturbations arise from quantum fluctuations of a scalar field @xmath94 , the vacuum energy of which drives a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe .",
    "the classical density perturbation thus generated has a spectrum determined by the ` inflaton ' potential @xmath95 , with a power - law index which is dependent on @xmath96 @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the planck mass and @xmath99 denotes that this is to be evaluated when a mode of wavenumber @xmath96 crosses the hubble radius @xmath100 . for a sufficiently ` flat potential ' ( as is necessary to drive enough e - folds of inflation to solve the problems of the standard cosmology ) , the spectrum indeed has @xmath101 , with corrections @xmath102 .",
    "gravitational instability sets in only when the universe becomes matter - dominated and this modifies the spectrum on length scales smaller than the hubble radius at this epoch , viz . for @xmath103 .",
    "thus the characteristics of the dark matter can be encoded into a ` transfer function ' @xmath104 which modulates the primordial spectrum ; for hdm this is an exponentially falling function while for cdm it is a more gradual power - law .",
    "now the power spectrum inferred from observations may be compared with theoretical models , but another problem arises concerning how we are to normalize the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations , but there is , as yet , no ` standard model ' of inflation @xcite . ] particularly since these are in the dark matter and may differ significantly ( i.e. be ` biased ' ) from the observable fluctuations in the density of visible galaxies . fortunately , the primordial perturbations have another unique observational signature , viz .",
    "they induce temperature fluctuations in the cmb through the ` sachs - wolfe effect ' ( gravitational red / blue shifts ) on large angular scales @xmath105 , corresponding to spatial scales larger than the hubble radius on the last scattering surface @xcite .",
    "it was the cobe measurement of these fluctuations a decade ago that initiated the modern era of cosmological structure formation studies .",
    "the quadrupole anisotropy in the cmb measured by cobe @xcite allows a determination of the fluctuation amplitude at the scale , @xmath106 , corresponding to the present hubble radius . with this normalization",
    "it became clear that a @xmath107 hdm universe indeed had too little power on small - scales for adequate galaxy formation .",
    "however it also became apparent that the ` standard cdm model ' when normalized to cobe had too much power on small - scales ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the implied neutrino mass was @xmath112 , presumably that of the @xmath113 given the usual hierarchy implied by the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the suppression of small - scale power delays the epoch of galaxy formation , so constraints on the hdm component can also be obtained from the abundance of high redshift objects such as qsos and ly-@xmath114 systems ; this gave an _ upper _ bound of 4.7  ev on the neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "more baroque schemes in which two neutrinos have comparable masses ( @xmath115 ) were also constructed @xcite seeking to reconcile the lsnd report of neutrino oscillations @xcite with the atmospheric neutrino anomaly which had just been reported by kamiokande @xcite .",
    "this was an exciting time for neutrino cosmology as both laboratory data and astronomical observations supported the possibility that a substantial fraction of the cosmological mass density is in the form of massive neutrinos .",
    "however another way to reconcile a cdm universe with the small - scale observations is to relax the underlying assumption that the primordial spectrum is strictly _ scale - invariant_. as shown in fig.1 , a ` tilted ' spectrum with @xmath116 also gives a good fit to the data @xcite . at first sight",
    "this might strike one as simply introducing an additional parameter ( although this is arguably no worse than introducing an additional form of dark matter ) .",
    "however one should really ask why the spectrum should be assumed to have a power - law index @xmath91 in the first place . as indicated in eq.([nk ] ) , @xmath117 in fact varies slowly with @xmath96 and is determined by the slope and curvature of the scalar potential at the epoch when the fluctuation at a specified value of @xmath96 crosses the hubble radius . the corresponding number of e - folds before the end of inflation is just @xmath118 , for typical choices of the inflationary scale , reheat temperature etc . we see that fluctuations on the scales ( @xmath119 ) probed by lss and cmb observations are generated just @xmath120 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "it is quite natural to expect the inflaton potential to begin curving significantly as the end of inflation is approached , especially in ` new inflation ' ( small field ) models .",
    "there are certainly attractive models of inflation in which the spectrum is significantly tilted in this region , in particular an inflationary model based on @xmath121 supergravity @xcite naturally gives @xmath122 at these scales .",
    "with such a _ scale - dependent _ tilt for the primordial spctrum , the lss data can be fitted reasonably well , with no need for any hdm component @xcite .",
    "( of course in the absence of a ` standard model ' of inflation , it might be argued that the inflationary spectrum may instead have @xmath123 thus allowing a _",
    "larger _ hdm component . )    as fig.1 shows , yet another way of suppressing small - scale power in the cdm cosmogony is to decrease the matter content of the universe , since this postpones the epoch of matter - radiation equality and thus shifts the peak of power spectrum to larger scales .",
    "furthermore the spatial geometry can be maintained flat if there is a cosmological constant with @xmath124 .",

    "( this can be tagged via the correlated abundance of oxygen and nitrogen which are made _ only _ in stars . )",
    "even so , chemical evolution arguments have been used to limit the primordial abundances of @xmath184 and @xmath185 and thus derive increasingly severe bounds on @xmath161 @xcite , culminating in one _ below _ 3 @xcite !",

    "we observe @xmath162 in clouds of ionized hydrogen ( h  ii regions ) , the most metal - poor of which are in dwarf blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "there is now a large body of data on @xmath162 and c , n , o in these systems which confirm that the small stellar contribution to helium is positively correlated with ` metal ' production ; extrapolating to zero metallicity gives the primordial @xmath162 abundance @xcite : @xmath190 here and subsequently , the first error is statistical , and the second is an estimate of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the latter clearly dominates , and is based on the scatter in different analyses of the physical properties of the h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "other extrapolations to zero metallicity give @xmath191 @xcite , and @xmath192 @xcite , while the average in the 5 most metal - poor objects is @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "the value in eq.([ypobs ] ) , shown in fig .  5 , is consistent with all these determinations .",
    "the systems best suited for li observations are hot , metal - poor stars belonging to the halo population ( pop  ii ) of our galaxy . observations have long shown that li does not vary significantly in such stars having metallicities less than 1/30 of solar  the ` spite plateau ' .",
    "recent precision data suggest a small but significant correlation between li and fe @xcite which can be understood as the result of li production from cosmic rays @xcite . extrapolating to zero metallicity one arrives at a primordial value @xcite",
    "@xmath194 the last error is our estimate of the maximum upward correction necessary to allow for possible destruction of li in pop  ii stars , due to e.g. mixing of the outer layers with the hotter interior @xcite .",
    "such processes can be constrained by the absence of significant scatter in the li - fe correlation plot @xcite , and through observations of the even more fragile isotope @xmath195li @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", high - resolution spectra have revealed the presence of d in quasar absorption systems ( qas ) at high - redshift , via its isotope - shifted lyman-@xmath114 absorption .",
    "it is believed that there are no astrophysical sources of deuterium , so any measurement of d / h provides a lower limit to the primordial abundance and thus an upper limit on @xmath181 ; for example , the local interstellar value of @xmath196 @xcite requires @xmath197 .",
    "early reports of @xmath198 towards 2 quasars ( q0014 + 813 @xcite and pg1718 + 4807 @xcite ) have been undermined by later analyses @xcite .",
    "three high quality observations yield @xmath199 ( pks1937 - 1009 ) , @xmath200 ( q1009 + 2956 ) , and @xmath201 ( hs0105 + 1619 ) ; their average value @xmath202 has been widely promoted as _ the _ primordial abundance @xcite .",
    "recently , the same group @xcite have provided another measurement : @xmath203 ( hs 243 + 3057 ) .",
    "however the observed dispersion in the measurements suggests either that systematic uncertainties have been underestimated , or that there is intrinsic dispersion in the d abundance in qas .",
    "other values have been reported in different ( damped lyman-@xmath114 ) systems which have a higher column density of neutral h , viz .",
    "@xmath204 ( q0347 - 3819 ) @xcite and @xmath205 ( q2206 - 199 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , allowing for a more complex velocity structure than assumed in these analyses raises the inferred abundance by upto @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "even the ism value of d / h now shows unexpected scatter of a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "all this may indicate significant processing of the @xmath184 abundance even at high redshift .",
    "given these uncertainties , it is prudent to bound the primordial abundance with an upper limit set by the non - detection of d absorption in a high - redshift system ( q0130 - 4021 ) @xcite , and the lower limit set by the local interstellar value @xcite , both at @xmath188 : @xmath207    for @xmath185 , the only observations available are in the solar system and ( high - metallicity ) h  ii regions in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this makes inference of the primordial abundance difficult , a problem compounded by the fact that stellar nucleosynthesis models for @xmath185 are in conflict with observations @xcite .",
    "such conflicts can perhaps be resolved if a large fraction of low mass stars destroy @xmath185 by internal mixing driven by stellar rotation , consistent with the observed @xmath208c/@xmath209c ratios @xcite .",
    "the observed abundance ` plateau ' in h  ii regions then implies a limit on the primordial value of @xmath210 @xcite , which is consistent with the other abundance constraints we discuss .    the overlap in the @xmath181 ranges spanned by the larger boxes in fig .",
    "5 indicates overall concordance between the various abundance determinations . accounting for theoretical uncertainties as well as the statistical and systematic errors in observations ,",
    "there is acceptable agreement among the abundances when @xcite @xmath211 however the agreement is far less satisfactory if we use only the quoted statistical errors in the observations . as seen in fig .  5 ,",
    "@xmath162 and @xmath186 are consistent with each other but favor a value of @xmath181 which is _ discrepant _ by @xmath212 from the value @xmath213 indicated by the d abundance ( [ d ] ) alone .",
    "it is important to note that it is the latter which essentially provides the widely - quoted ` precision ' determination of the baryon density : @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "additional studies are required to clarify if this discrepancy is real .",
    "the recent wmap data on cmb fluctuations implies a baryon abundance of @xmath214 if the primordial perturbations are assumed to have a power - law form @xcite ; the value decreases by @xmath215 if the spectral index is allowed to vary with scale , as is now indicated by the observations .",
    "although broadly consistent with the determinations based on primordial abundances , it is clear that this exacerbates the tension with the @xmath162 and @xmath186 measurements mentioned above .",
    "it has been proposed that the cmb determination of @xmath216 can be used as an input into bbn calculations @xcite",
    ". however it would be advisable to await further lss data from sdss @xcite to pin down more precisely the primordial fluctuation spectrum , to which such determinations are sensitive .",
    "for example , allowing for a ` step ' in the primordial spectrum at @xmath217  mpc@xmath218 , as was indicated by data from the apm galaxy survey @xcite , can _ decrease _ the baryon density inferred from the wmap+2dfgrs data by upto @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "given this situation , it is still neccessary to be conservative in evaluating bounds on @xmath161 from bbn .",
    "an analysis based on simple @xmath143 statistics and taking into account the correlated uncertainties of the elemental yields , gives @xcite @xmath220 tighter bounds can of course be obtained under less conservative assumptions , e.g. adopting the d abundance ( [ d ] ) requires @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "if true , such bounds rule out the possibility of ` sterile ' neutrinos since these would be brought into equilibrium through mixing with the active neutrinos in all currently viable schemes @xcite .",
    "the wmap determination of the baryon density seems to require @xmath161 less than 3 @xcite but is consistent with the standard model taking systematic uncertainties in the elemental abundances into account @xcite .",
    "moreover as emphasized above , the wmap determination of @xmath181 will have to ve lowered if the primordial spectrum is not scale - free and this will considerably ease the present tension .",
    "( the wmap+2dfgrs data by themselves restrict @xmath222 assuming a flat universe @xcite . )",
    "the above limits hold for the standard bbn model and one can ask to what extent they can be modified if plausible changes are made to the model .",
    "for example , there may be an initial excess of electron neutrinos over antineutrinos , parametrised by a ` chemical potential ' @xmath223 in the distribution function : @xmath224^{-1}$ ] .",
    "then @xmath225 equilibrium is shifted in favour of less neutrons , thus reducing the @xmath162 abundance by a factor @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "however the accompanying increase in the relativistic energy density speeds up the expansion rate and increases the @xmath171 ratio at freeze - out , leading to more @xmath162 , although this effect is smaller . for neutrinos of other flavours which do not participate in nuclear reactions ,",
    "only the latter effect was presumed to operate , allowing the possibility of balancing a small chemical potential in @xmath20 by a much larger chemical potential in @xmath227 , and thus substantially enlarging the concordance range of @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "however the recent recognition from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments that the different flavours are maximally mixed , no longer permits such a hierarchy of chemical potentials @xcite , thus ruling out this possible loophole .",
    "consequently the relic neutrino abundance can not be significantly different from the value ( [ nnu ] ) .",
    "a small chemical potential in electron neutrinos of @xmath228 is however still possible and could be another explanation for why the @xmath162 abundance seems to be lower than the value that would be expected on the basis of the measurements of the d abundance or the cmb anisotropy .",
    "another possible change to standard bbn is to allow inhomogeneities in the baryon distribution , created e.g. during the qcd ( de)confinement transition .",
    "if the characteristic inhomogeneity scale exceeds the neutron diffusion scale during bbn , then increasing the average value of @xmath181 increases the synthesised abundances such that the observational limits essentially rule out such inhomogeneities .",
    "however fluctuations in @xmath181 on smaller scales will result in neutrons escaping from the high density regions leading to spatial variations in the @xmath171 ratio which might allow the upper limit to @xmath181 to be raised substantially @xcite .",
    "recent calculations show that d and @xmath162 can indeed be matched even when @xmath181 is raised by a factor of @xmath229 by suitably tuning the amplitude and scale of the fluctuations , but this results in unacceptable overproduction of @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "a variant on the above possibility is to allow for regions of antimatter which annihilate during or even after bbn ; however the @xmath186 abundance again restricts the possibility of raising the limit on @xmath181 substantially @xcite .",
    "finally the synthesised abundances can be altered if a relic massive particle decays during or after bbn generating electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the radiation - dominated plasma .",
    "interestingly enough the processed yields of d , @xmath162 and @xmath186 can then be made to match the observations even for a universe closed by baryons @xcite , however the production of @xmath195li is excessive and argues against this possibility .    in summary , standard",
    "bbn appears to be reasonably robust ( although non - standard possibilities can not be _ definitively _ ruled out ) and consistent with @xmath177 , leaving little room for new physics .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the elemental abundance determinations need to be substantially reduced in order to make further progress .",
    "the study of neutrinos in cosmology has had a long history . however as both theory and observations have improved , the fascinating possibilities that had been raised in early work have gradually been eliminated . in particular neutrino ( hot )",
    "dark matter is no longer required by our present understanding of large - scale structure .",
    "cosmological bounds on neutrino masses continue to be more restrictive than laboratory limits and all known species are now required to be sufficiently light that the rich phenomenology of unstable neutrinos is now largely of historical interest",
    ". moreover there is no motivation from considerations of primordial nucleosynthesis for invoking new sterile neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless such neutrinos can exist ( e.g. in the ` bulk ' @xcite ) and there may yet be surprises from the big bang in store for us .",

    "<S> this possibility has however been increasingly constrained by cosmological considerations , particularly of large - scale structure formation , thus yielding stringent bounds on neutrino masses , which have yet to be matched by laboratory experiments . </S>",
    "<S> another probe of relic neutrinos is primordial nucleosynthesis which is sensitive to the number of neutrino types ( including possible sterile species ) as well to any lepton asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> combining such arguments with the experimental finding that neutrino mixing angles are large , excludes the possibility of a large asymmetry and disfavours new neutrinos beyond those now known .    </S>",
