    "the widely known class of plane - fronted gravitational waves with parallel rays ( _ pp_-waves ) has become a paradigm of exact radiative spacetimes in general relativity . found by brinkmann in 1923",
    "@xcite and later rediscovered independently by several authors , it has been studied for decades .",
    "the metric of vacuum _",
    "pp_-waves can be written in the standard form @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary function of the retarded time @xmath2 and the complex coordinate @xmath3 spanning the plane wave surfaces @xmath4 const .",
    "when @xmath5 is linear in @xmath3 , the metric ( [ e1 ] ) represents minkowski universe since the only non - trivial components of the curvature tensor are proportional to @xmath6 . thus the simplest case for which ( [ e1 ] ) describes gravitational waves arises for @xmath7 , where an arbitrary function @xmath8 characterizes the ` profile ' of the wave .",
    "solutions of this type are called plane waves ( or homogeneous _ pp_-waves ) and have been investigated extensively in the literature ( see @xcite,@xcite for refs ) .",
    "this important class of exact radiative spacetimes has also been used for the construction of sandwich waves ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) for which @xmath8 is non - vanishing on a finite interval of @xmath2 only .",
    "also , the very interesting problem of the collision of two plane waves has been thoroughly studied ( see @xcite for review of the topic and refs . )    surprisingly , more general non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves with generic or sandwich wave - profiles have not been investigated as much ( a physical interpretation of some solutions of this type was proposed e.g. in @xcite,@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "much attention has been payed to impulsive waves described by the metric ( [ e1 ] ) with the function @xmath5 of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dirac distribution .",
    "these solutions have attracted attention recently not only for the investigation of gravitational radiation emitted during the collision of black holes @xcite,@xcite , but also in the context of field and string theories in a study of the scattering processes at extremely high planckian energies , see @xcite and elsewhere .",
    "such impulsive waves can naturally be understood as distributional limits of suitable sequences of sandwich waves regularizing the dirac @xmath11 .",
    "spacetimes of this type can also be obtained by boosting the schwarzschild , other kerr - newman , and dilaton black holes @xcite-@xcite , or axially symmetric solutions of the weyl class @xcite to the speed of light .",
    "some of these solutions can be interpreted as impulsive _",
    "pp_-waves generated by null particles of an arbitrary multipole structure @xcite .",
    "another method for constructing general impulsive _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes has been proposed in @xcite : the ` scissors - and - paste ' approach is based on the removal of a null hyperplane from minkowski spacetime and re - attaching the parts by making a formal identification with a ` warp ' .",
    "this corresponds to a specific coordinate shift @xcite .",
    "impulsive _ pp_-waves can alternatively be introduced using a different coordinate system in which the metric is explicitly continuous @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has only recently been shown @xcite that these approaches are equivalent in a rigorous sense .",
    "they lead to identical ( unique ) particle motion , i.e. the corresponding geodesics in ( [ e1 ] ) , see @xcite-@xcite , agree with those obtained from the continuous form of the metric .    in our recent works @xcite , @xcite we demonstrated that geodesic motion in the class of non - homogeneous vacuum _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes is chaotic .",
    "this is the first example of chaos in exact radiative spacetimes ( chaotic behavior of geodesics in various black - hole spacetimes is well known , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite , and references therein ) . it is the purpose of the presented paper to generalize these results which remained restricted to spacetimes ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , i.e. those having a _ constant _ profile , @xmath14 const . in particular , we wish to investigate the behavior of geodesics in non - homogeneous sandwich _ pp_-waves and in the corresponding impulsive limits .    in section  2",
    "we briefly summarize previous results concerning chaotic motion in _ pp_-waves with a constant profile . also , we introduce the concepts and quantities necessary for our subsequent investigation .",
    "section  3 is devoted to geodesics in the simplest sandwich _",
    "pp_-waves having a ` square ' profile",
    ". a rigorous characterization of the level of the fractal structure of basin boundaries ( which separate initial conditions leading to different outcomes ) by the ` number of radial bounces ' of geodesics is introduced .",
    "this enables us to describe quantitatively how chaos smears as the sequence of sandwich waves approaches the impulsive limit .",
    "the same behavior of geodesics is investigated within the class of smooth sandwich waves in section  4 , where a relation between the smearing of chaotic behavior and the gradual vanishing of the outcome channels is also discussed . in section  5",
    "explicit ( i.e. non - chaotic ) geodesics in the resulting non - homogeneous impulsive _",
    "pp_-waves are presented and interpreted physically .",
    "finally , in section  6 we discuss the effect of the focusing of geodesics and describe the deformation of a disc of test particles .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xcite the geodesic equations for ( [ e1 ] ) reduce to @xmath15\\,\\d \\tau+\\tilde v \\ , \\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is an affine parameter , dot denotes @xmath17 , @xmath18 are constants , and @xmath19 for timelike , null or spacelike geodesics , respectively .",
    "it suffices to find solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) . introducing real coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath22 , this system follows from the hamiltonian @xmath23 where the potential is @xmath24 . for non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves given by @xmath25 the corresponding polynomial potential @xmath26 at any @xmath27 is called ` @xmath28-saddle ' .",
    "it can by visualized in polar coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , in which it takes the form @xmath32 .",
    "it was shown in a series of mathematical papers @xcite-@xcite that motion in the hamiltonian system ( [ e7 ] ) with a polynomial potential ( [ e7b ] ) where @xmath14 const .",
    "is chaotic .",
    "note that , interestingly , in the simplest case @xmath33 the corresponding ` monkey saddle ' potential ( after removing the factor @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 , so that we get the particular case of the famous hnon - heiles hamiltonian @xcite ( with missing quadratic terms ) which is a ` textbook ' example of a chaotic system .",
    "this was investigated by rod @xcite who concentrated on the topology of _ bounded orbits _ in the energy manifolds @xmath36 .",
    "the sets of orbits asymptotic to the basic unstable periodic orbits ( denoted by @xmath37 ) as @xmath38 intersect transversely .",
    "this proves the existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits and indicates the complicated structure of the flow .",
    "these results were later refined in @xcite by showing that @xmath37 are hyperbolic , so that they admit stable and unstable asymptotic manifolds . finally , in @xcite the above hamiltonian was presented as an example of a system for which the smale horseshoe map can explicitly be embedded as a subsystem along the homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits .",
    "it was shown in @xcite - @xcite that similar results hold for a general potential ( [ e7b ] ) with @xmath39 . therefore , geodesic motion in all non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes with the corresponding function ( [ e7a ] ) is chaotic .    in order to support these arguments for the chaotic behavior , we investigated @xcite@xcite the structure of motion by a fractal method .",
    "complementary to the analysis described above , we concentrated on _ unbounded _ geodesics . the fractal method ( advanced in relativity in @xcite-@xcite and elsewhere )",
    "starts with a definition of several distinct asymptotic outcomes ( given here by ` types of ends ' of all trajectories ) .",
    "subsequently , a set of initial conditions is evolved until one of the outcome states is reached .",
    "chaos is established if the basin boundaries which separate initial conditions leading to different outcomes are fractal .",
    "such fractal partitions are the result of chaotic dynamics and measure an extremally sensitive dependence of the evolution on the choice of initial conditions .",
    "we have observed exactly these structures in the system studied .",
    "we integrated numerically the equations of motion given by ( [ e2 ] ) , ( [ e7a ] ) for @xmath39 . the initial conditions ( without loss of generality )",
    "were chosen such that the geodesics started ( from rest ) at @xmath40 from a unit circle in the ( @xmath41)-plane .",
    "the initial positions were parametrized by an angle @xmath42 such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 . in fig .  1 we present typical trajectories for @xmath45 .",
    "each unbounded geodesic escapes to infinity where the curvature singularity is located _ only along _ one of the @xmath28 _ distinct outcome channels _ in the potential with the radial axis @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( in fact , it oscillates around the axis with frequency growing to infinity and amplitude approaching zero @xcite ) .",
    "these channels represent possible outcomes of our system and we label them by the corresponding values of @xmath48 . in certain regions",
    "the function @xmath49 representing a portrait of the basin structure depends sensitively on initial position given by @xmath30  see fig .",
    "1 where the ( finite resolution ) results for @xmath45 are shown . in the same diagrams we plot",
    "the function @xmath50 which takes the value of @xmath16 when the singularity is reached by a given geodesic .",
    "the boundaries between the outcomes are fractal which we confirmed in @xcite on the enlarged detail , on the detail of the detail etc . up to the sixth level ( where numerical errors became significant ) . at",
    "_ each level _ the structure has the property that between two connected sets of geodesics with channels @xmath51 and @xmath52 there is always a smaller set of geodesics with channel @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this has a counterpart in @xmath50 , see fig .  1 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 diverges on each discontinuity of @xmath49 , i.e. , on any fractal basin boundary .",
    "there is an infinite number of peaks , each corresponding to an unstable trapped orbit which never ` decides ' on a particular outcome to infinity .",
    "also , @xmath56 increases as one zooms into the higher levels of the fractal .",
    "this is natural since higher levels are generated by geodesics which undergo ` more bounces ' in the inner region before escaping through one of the outcome channels .",
    "it can immediately be observed that the above results can easily be applied to a description of geodesics in shock _",
    "pp_-waves given by the metric ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ e7a ] ) with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the heaviside step function .",
    "it is natural to consider free test particles which are at rest ( @xmath59 ) in the flat minkowski half - space @xmath60 .",
    "( the minkowski coordinates are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . ) at @xmath65 these particles are hit by the shock and subsequently for @xmath66 they move in the wave with a constant profile @xmath39 .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding geodesics has been summarized in section  2 . in particular , the trajectories and the fractal structure of basin boundaries have again the form indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , the geodesic motion in non - homogeneous shock _ pp_-waves is chaotic in a rigorous sense .",
    "however , it could be argued that these above results concern very specific and rather ` unrealistic ' classes of _ pp_-wave solutions for which the profile function @xmath8 in ( [ e7a ] ) is constant on an infinite interval of the retarded time @xmath2 .",
    "such waves have an ` infinite duration ' and a constant ` strength ' .",
    "it is the purpose of the presented work to investigate more realistic non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves , namely sandwich waves of this type described by functions @xmath8 having only finite support .    for an investigation of sandwich waves",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the geodesics by the coordinate @xmath2 instead of the parameter @xmath16 ; for @xmath67 we get from eqs .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , ( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e7a ] ) @xmath68 where prime denotes @xmath69 . for timelike geodesics we can simply substitute @xmath70 in the result in order to obtain the dependence on the proper time .",
    "it is natural to start with the simplest sandwich waves having a ` square ' profile @xmath71\\ , \\label{e9}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are positive constants .",
    "there are flat minkowski regions in front of the wave @xmath74 and behind the wave @xmath75 . within the wavezone",
    "@xmath76 the amplitude is constant , @xmath77 , and we can use the results described above . in particular , we can study a deformation of a ring of particles in the @xmath78-plane which are at rest in front of the wave .",
    "the particles start moving at @xmath65 and then follow exactly the same trajectories @xmath67 as shown in fig .  1 for @xmath79 . at @xmath80",
    "the influence of the sandwich wave ends , the potential ( [ e7b ] ) defining the outcome channels vanishes , and for @xmath81 , the particles move uniformly in different directions along straight lines in the flat space behind the wave .",
    "consequently , the fractal structure of basin boundaries indicating chaos is ` cut ' at some level given by the value of @xmath72 : there is not enough time for particles to bounce _ arbitrarily many _",
    "times between the potential walls . as @xmath82",
    ", the number of bounces tends to zero so that the fractal structure is completely erased . in other words , for smaller @xmath72 , the dependence on initial conditions is less sensitive since the prediction of the outcome can be done with only a lower resolution . the narrower the sandwich wave , the ` less chaotic ' the corresponding geodesic motion .",
    "finally , in the impulsive case given by the limit @xmath83 of ( [ e9 ] ) , i.e. @xmath84 , @xmath85 , the motion is non - chaotic .",
    "this effect can be called a ` smearing of chaos ' in the impulsive limit of non - homogeneous sandwich _ pp_-waves .",
    "this behavior can be described formally .",
    "let us define the _ number of bounces _",
    "@xmath86 of the geodesic as the number of ( local ) maxima of the function @xmath87 measuring the radial distance from the origin of the ( @xmath88)-plane .",
    "@xmath86 represents the number of times the geodesic crosses the phase - space surface of section @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) before escaping to infinity .",
    "this is a more appropriate measure here than the twist number used in literature on chaotic dynamics . as in the previous section , we consider a family of geodesics starting from rest from a unit circle @xmath91 with the angle @xmath30 parametrizing their initial positions . in fig .  2 we plot the function @xmath92 for the geodesics given by eq .",
    "( [ e9a ] ) with @xmath93 and @xmath33 .",
    "the sequence of graphs shows the zooming in of the fractal interval around the value @xmath94 . also , we plot the function @xmath95 which takes the value of @xmath2 when the singularity at @xmath96 is reached by a given geodesic .",
    "it is obvious that the fractal structure described by the function @xmath92 corresponds to the structure given by @xmath95 . also , @xmath86 is a precise definition of the ` level ' of the fractal since we have demonstrated that the @xmath86-th level of the fractal structure is given by those geodesics which bounce exactly @xmath86 times before they choose one of the outcome channels .",
    "now we can describe how the fractal structure indicating chaos arises .",
    "let us denote by @xmath97 the set of initial conditions @xmath30 generating geodesics with @xmath98 , where @xmath99 . clearly , @xmath100 , and the complement of @xmath101 describes the fractal boundary intimately related to the fractal structure of the outcome basin boundaries ( although the discontinuities in @xmath92 and @xmath49 do not coincide ) .",
    "now , we define a sequence of real numbers @xmath102 .",
    "their physical meaning is the following : at @xmath103 _ all _ geodesics generated by @xmath97 have already fallen into the singularity at @xmath96 along the three channels given by @xmath104 ( after performing at most @xmath105 bounces ) . from numerical simulations visualized in fig .  2 we obtained the values @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "now , we quantitatively characterize the behavior of geodesics in the sandwich wave given by ( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude within the wavezone is @xmath77 but it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e9a ] ) that we can obtain the corresponding values of @xmath95 from those for @xmath93 ( discussed above ) by a simple rescaling @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is drawn in fig .  2 .",
    "notice that @xmath114 as @xmath115 .",
    "it is obvious that all geodesics for which @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 , have time enough to fall into the singularity ( in the impulsive limit , @xmath83 , this condition can not be satisfied so that none of the geodesics considered ends in the singularity ) .",
    "since @xmath92 is independent of the rescaling of @xmath2 , the fractal structure of initial conditions given by @xmath97 and the values of @xmath118 do not depend on @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath119 guarantees that _ all _ geodesics starting from the initial set @xmath97 will manage to fall into the singularity at @xmath96 along the three channels ( bouncing at most @xmath105-times before that ) . for a sequence of sandwich waves with @xmath120 leading to the impulsive limit as @xmath82 ,",
    "this condition reduces to a simple relation @xmath121 which can be interpreted as follows . in order to emerge the @xmath105-th level of the fractal structure of motion the sandwich wave must have at least the duration @xmath72 such that @xmath121 . for example , if @xmath122 then all geodesics with @xmath123 bounces have time enough to choose the corresponding channel and fall along this into the singularity , i.e. @xmath124 is fully developed . for smaller @xmath72",
    "the fractal structure is ` cut ' at lower levels @xmath97 so that the geodesic motion becomes ` less chaotic ' . for @xmath125",
    "the fractal structure vanishes since there is no time for any geodesic ( performing at least one bounce ) to choose the outcome channel and fall into the singularity .",
    "thus , for @xmath82 the motion is regular .",
    "this effect occurs in all non - homogeneous sandwich _",
    "pp_-waves with arbitrary exponent @xmath126 , only the specific values of @xmath118 for a given @xmath28 are different : for higher @xmath28 the values of @xmath118 are smaller .",
    "we have observed that , in non - homogeneous sandwich _ pp_-waves with a short duration , many particles still remain in the inner region when the potential ( [ e7b ] ) defining the outcome channels vanishes .",
    "these particles move through various points in different directions having different velocities when the sandwich wave ends .",
    "subsequently , they move uniformly in the minkowski space behind the wave and it is obvious that they will _ not _ follow former channels to the singularity at @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , any point is accessible by some trajectory .",
    "the narrower the sandwich wave , the greater the number of particles moving ` outside ' the channels .    in order to illustrate such behavior of geodesics ( and to emphasize this important aspect of the impulsive limit )",
    "we consider another type of sandwich waves ( [ e7a ] ) with the profile function @xmath127 where @xmath128 are positive constants .",
    "note that the corresponding radiative spacetimes are curved everywhere , becoming flat ( exponentially fast ) only asymptotically as @xmath129 . on the other hand ,",
    "these waves are smooth since all derivatives of @xmath8 are continuous",
    ". moreover , ( [ e10 ] ) is more appropriate for numerical integration of geodesics ( contrary to the case of simplest waves given by eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) we need not apply the junction conditions which guarantee the continuity of motion at @xmath65 and @xmath80 where @xmath8 is discontinuous ) . again",
    ", we consider a ring of free test particles which are at rest at @xmath65 ( other initial conditions , e.g. a ring which is at rest at @xmath130 lead to analogous results ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show their geodesic motion in the wave with @xmath33 and @xmath8 of the form ( [ e10 ] ) , for different values of the parameter @xmath131 . for very small values of @xmath132 the profile remains almost constant on a large interval of @xmath2 and the trajectories ` coincide ' with those shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the outcome channels are very well defined and the motion is chaotic . however , with a growing value of @xmath132 these channels become fuzzy . it is harder and harder to distinguish between them , so that the basin boundaries lose their fractal structure . for @xmath133 , the profile function ( [ e10 ] ) approaches the dirac delta ( in a distributional sense ) and again , in the impulsive limit the geodesic motion is not chaotic but regular .",
    "this effect is quantitatively characterized in fig .  4 where we plot the function @xmath49 for different values of @xmath132 .",
    "for this purpose we define three outcome windows as small intervals @xmath134 of angles around the radial axes @xmath104 of the three outcome channels ( localized sufficiently far away from the origin ) ; here we consider @xmath135 .",
    "when a geodesic starting at @xmath30 passes through some outcome window we assign the corresponding value of @xmath136 to it .",
    "if the trajectory does _ not _ pass through any of the three windows then we define @xmath137 which means that the geodesic does not approach infinity along the outcome channels @xmath104 . from a sequence presented in fig .  4 it is obvious that the number of geodesics localized outside the channels increases with a growing value of @xmath132 , i.e. as the sandwich profiles approach the impulsive limit . in the same diagrams we also plot the function @xmath95 .",
    "one can observe that the number of geodesics reaching the singularity in finite values of @xmath138 rapidly decreases with a growing @xmath132 .",
    "in particular , all geodesics outside the channel windows ( with @xmath137 ) have @xmath139 .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath140 such that for @xmath141 _ all _ geodesics considered have @xmath142 , see fig .",
    "these geodesics reaching @xmath96 at @xmath142 are , in fact , given by specific solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e9a ] ) for which the condition @xmath143 is satisfied for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , i.e. the acceleration is negligible and asymptotically the particles move uniformly along straight lines .",
    "the coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend linearly on @xmath2 , so that @xmath96 is reached at @xmath146 . note that for the smooth profile ( [ e10 ] ) of the wave with @xmath33 this condition reduces to @xmath147 . once this condition is satisfied for some @xmath2 , it is valid for all greater values of @xmath2 since the left hand side grows exponentially while the right hand side only linearly as @xmath148 .",
    "finally , we wish to find the critical value of @xmath149 . from fig .  4 it is obvious that for @xmath150 even the geodesic starting at @xmath65 from rest from the unit circle at @xmath151 ( and similarly from @xmath152 ) will reach @xmath96 with an infinite value of @xmath138 . in real coordinates , this geodesic is given by @xmath153 , @xmath154 , with @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "introducing @xmath157 we get the equation @xmath158 , @xmath159 ; the corresponding solutions for various values of @xmath131 are plotted in fig .  5 . for small @xmath132",

    "it becomes concave so that the geodesics approaches infinity only as @xmath148 .",

    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that these two approaches are equivalent in a mathematical sense ( even if the transformation ( [ e12 ] ) , ( [ e13 ] ) is discontinuous ) .",

    "the corresponding curve is called a _ rose _ since it resembles a flower with @xmath28 petals ( for @xmath223 the rose degenerates to a line since @xmath265 ) .",

    ", becomes non - negative and subsequently grows to positive values , uniformly with @xmath2 . in combination with the deformation in the transversal plane we get an interesting new effect of ` wrapping up ' of the inner part of the disc into a closed caustic surface as shown in fig .",
    "note that this behavior is specific for non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves and does not occur in impulsive plane waves since @xmath271 when @xmath223 .",
    "we have shown for non - homogeneous _ pp_-wave spacetimes that the motion of free test particles is chaotic . however , for non - homogeneous sandwich gravitational waves the chaotic behavior smears as the duration of the wave tends to zero . in the limit of impulsive waves",
    "the motion is regular . the focusing effect of non - homogeneous impulsive waves",
    "can also be described explicitly and leads to a formation of a specific closed caustic surface .",
    "it would be an interesting task to investigate from this point of view geodesics in other classes of exact radiative spacetimes and elucidate an open question whether such a type of behavior is common in general relativity .    also , it is obvious that sandwich _",
