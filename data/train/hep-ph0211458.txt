    "the central role played by rare decays on our understanding of elementary particle physics , is well known , where `` rare '' stands here for flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , which are either small or practically vanishing in the sm . some highlights : are : + 1 . in @xmath2",

    "+ 2 . in @xmath4 physics : the importance of @xmath5 in the sm and for extracting limits on beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenarios @xcite .",
    "the top quark fcnc provide an excellent tool to investigate various extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "the experimental upper limit of the decay @xmath6 @xcite , places severe limits on extensions of the sm .    in view of the above and prompted by the recent discussion of a giga-@xmath0 option at tesla @xcite in which the center - of - mass energy will be lowered to @xmath7 , producing more than @xmath8 @xmath0 bosons ( _ i.e. _ @xmath9 times the number produced at lep ) , one should investigate rare decays of @xmath0s .",
    "now since the important subject of rare leptonic @xmath10 decays , for which the sm branching ratio is @xmath11 , was covered by illana @xcite , we concentrate here on purely hadronic fcnc @xmath12 decays .",
    "in fact we only discuss @xmath13 which in most models , including the sm , has the largest branching ratio among hadronic fcnc @xmath0 decays .",
    "note however that experimentally , the latter is practically inseparable from the @xmath14 mode .",
    "let us also note that when referring to the @xmath15 mode , we actually mean @xmath16 .",
    "we note here that in the sm @xcite @xmath17 .    in the following sections we will discuss two variants of 2 higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) and two of supersymmetry ( susy ) . of the latter the first one will be : susy with squark mixing , while in the second one fcnc",
    "will result from susy with r parity violation ( denoted by rpv , or @xmath18 ) .",
    "as we will see , @xmath19 can be either smaller , the same or above the sm with a maximal value of @xmath20 .",
    "experimentally , the attention devoted to fcnc in hadronic @xmath0 decays at lep and sld has been close to nil .",
    "the best upper limit is @xcite @xmath21 .",
    "this is a preliminary delphi limit ( which will probably remain as such forever ... ) based on about @xmath22 hadronic decays .",
    "experimentalists who are privy to lep and sld data should be encouraged to look in their data and improve the above limit .    due to space limitations",
    ", the following discussion of various bsm models and their predictions for @xmath23 , will be sketchy .",
    "many more details and a more complete set of references can be found in @xcite .",
    "in fact , almost each reference should start with : `` see _ e.g._@xmath24 '' and end with : `` @xmath24 and references therein . ''",
    "we start with a generic calculation of the diagrams which modify ( at one loop ) the @xmath25 vertex , due to charged or neutral scalar , as depicted in fig .",

    "the stage is now ready for identifying , for each model , the relevant scalars @xmath48 , fermions @xmath49 and the couplings @xmath50 ( with the appropriate indices ) , as expressed in the feynman rules above .",
    "then , the route for obtaining @xmath51 using the generic equation in the previous section is clear .      in 2hdm with flavor diagonal couplings of the neutral higgs to down - quarks ,",
    "the fcnc @xmath52 go through the one - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "the scalars are the charged higgs bosons , @xmath53 and the fermions are @xmath54 .",
    "the couplings are : @xmath55 is as in the sm ( therefore only @xmath56 survives ) , @xmath57 is derived from the kinetic energy part of the lagrangian @xmath58 and @xmath59 is obtained from the yukawa part which , in common notation is @xcite : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a choice of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are @xmath63 matrices in flavor space , leads to a specific 2hdm .",
    "we now study two variants of 2hdm .",
    "in this model , called 2hdmii , @xmath64 , @xmath52 was considered before @xcite . using realistic values in the @xmath65 plane ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath66 , two orders of magnitude below the sm .      in this variant @xcite , named t2hdm ,",
    "the top is rewarded for its `` fatness '' by having its mass proportional to the large @xmath67 , while all other masses are proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "it therefore makes sense to consider here only @xmath69 . using t2hdm parameters consistent with data we find : @xmath70 .",
    "fcnc in susy can emanate from squark mixing in :    @xmath71    with the usual notation for the squark fields @xcite and where @xmath29 are generation indices .",
    "furthermore ,    @xmath72 + where @xmath73 ... are @xmath74 matrices . under certain assumptions @xcite and",
    "taking only @xmath75 or @xmath76 mixing into account :    @xmath77    the above @xmath78s represent squark mixing from non - diagonal bilinears in @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is a common squarks mass scale , obeying : @xmath81 .",
    "also , @xmath82s will stand for squark mixing from non - diagonal trilinears in @xmath79 @xcite . for them",
    "we adopt the ansatz of @xcite , leading to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a common trilinear soft breaking parameter for both up and down squarks .",
    "@xmath85 become @xmath86 matrices in the weak bases @xmath87 they are diagonalized to obtain the mass eigenstates @xmath88 with the help of @xmath89 which rotates @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "we can now describe two cases of squark mixing : @xmath75 and @xmath76 mixing .",
    "the scalars here are @xmath93 , since @xmath75 admixture states run in the loops .",
    "the gluon is the only fermion in the loops , thus @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath95 couplings are @xmath96 , since @xmath97 .",
    "in other words , one diagram ( out of the four generic diagrams ) vanishes .",
    "the @xmath98 and @xmath99 couplings are functions of elements of the rotation matrix @xmath100 mentioned above @xcite . since the two @xmath101 @xcite , we neglect them . for the other four @xmath78s",
    "we assume a common value , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath102 , and vary @xmath103 .",
    "the parameters needed for masses , mixing and @xmath104 are : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we vary them subject to @xmath107 gev and have plots of practically everything as a function of everything @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath108 , where the highest value is attained for @xmath109 and one @xmath110 @xmath111 the ew scale , while @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xmath111 few tev .",
    "such splitting requires `` heavy '' susy mass scale with soft breaking parameters , which is consistent with the non - observability of susy particles so far .      in this scenario",
    "the scalars are @xmath115 , similarly to the previous case , except for @xmath116 .",
    "obviously , @xmath76 admixture states run in the loops .",
    "the loop fermions are the two charginos @xmath117 , and all four generic diagrams contribute to @xmath52 .",
    "the feynman rules @xcite involve elements of the rotation matrix @xmath118 mentioned above and the chargino mixing matrices .    at the end of the day , running with the parameters over all values consistent with the data , and with @xmath119 gev and @xmath120 gev we obtain : @xmath70 , which we could have anticipated since br(through @xmath76 mixing ) : br(through @xmath75 mixing ) @xmath121 .      since there is no sacred principle which guarantees r - parity conservation , we assume in this part of the talk that @xmath122 is violated . then , @xmath18 terms in the susy superpotential @xmath123 lead to fcnc .",
    "@xmath124 terms ( pure @xmath125 ) in @xmath123 are irrelevant at the 1-loop level .",
    "in addition we assume , for the pure @xmath126 terms , that @xmath127 , and also neglect the bilinear term in the @xmath18 part of @xmath123",
    ". then : @xmath128 in addition , if @xmath18 is ok then the @xmath122 conserving soft susy breaking is extended .",
    "we need only the bilinear : @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , @xmath131 are the scalar components of the hatted @xmath132 and @xmath131 , respectively",
    ". we therefore have two types of fcnc : + * type a : * trilinear - trilinear : @xmath133 . + * type b : * trilinear - bilinear : @xmath134 .",
    "we further sub - divide type a contributions to 6 groups according to the scalars and fermions running in the loops .",
    "for instance , in type a1 the scalars are @xmath135 and the fermions are @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath95 couplings are identical to their sm values , @xmath136 ( for all @xmath29 and @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "unfortunately , going over all type a groups , taking into account the available limits on @xmath140s and on the other relevant parameters , we obtain for the trilinear - trilinear case : @xmath66 .",
    "our results are in agreement with the special cases in @xcite .      in this case",
    ", a higgs exchanged in the loop mixes with a slepton , through @xmath141 , assuming that only @xmath142 .",
    "we choose to work in the `` no vev '' basis @xmath143 in which : @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 are su(2 ) cp - even , cp - odd @xmath150-sneutrinos , @xmath151 , respectively . in the basis",
    "@xmath152 we wrote the mass matrix in the charged scalar sector , in the basis @xmath153 we wrote the mass matrix in the cp - even neutral scalar sector , and in the basis @xmath154 we wrote the mass matrix in the cp - odd neutral scalar sector .",
    "the new charged scalar and cp - even and cp - odd neutral scalar mass - eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing the above - mentioned matrices .",
    "they are : @xmath155 , and @xmath156 . in the limit @xmath157 : @xmath158 become the usual ones .",
    "rotating with the diagonalizing @xmath159 ( for charged , even - cp , odd - cp ) matrices , one goes from the @xmath90s to the @xmath91s .",

    "the @xmath95 couplings are equal to their values in the sm .",
    "the @xmath98 couplings include elements of the rotation matrix ( for the charged fields ) @xmath166 and @xmath167 , and @xmath168 + in this case @xmath169 and @xmath170 with @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "this is the only case for which our generic form is insufficient .",
    "this fact results from the appearance of two new diagrams proportional to a scalar - vector - vector coupling ( @xmath173 in our case ) .",
    "the other eight diagrams are special cases of the generic ones in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    inserting parameters consistent with the data we found that for type b : @xmath174 .",

    "the main background is from @xmath177 .",
    "using what , we think , are realistic efficiencies we find that a new physics signal @xmath178 , with a branching ratio of order @xmath179 , can reach beyond the 3-sigma level @xcite .",
    "we can also get a clue about how low one can go in the value ( or limit ) of @xmath180 with @xmath8 z - bosons , from the fact that the delphi preliminary result reached @xcite @xmath181 with @xmath182 @xmath0-bosons . scaling this limit , especially with the expected advances in @xmath98-tagging and identification of non-@xmath98 jets methods ,",
    "an @xmath183 branching ratios should be easily attained at a giga-@xmath0 factory .",
    "one needs realistic simulations as feasibility studies for this important rare @xmath0 decay mode .",
    "our results are best summarized in table 1 which shows the best values for @xmath23 in extensions of the sm discussed in this talk .",
    "the sm result is given for comparison .",
    "note that we have not included interference with the sm as each of the values `` stands alone '' . in some cases such interference may increase the branching ratio to @xmath184 .",
    "we conclude that giga-@xmath0 experiments will have the opportunity to place significant limits , or hopefully discover the scenario beyond the sm , by searching for hadronic ( and leptonic @xcite ) neutral current flavor changing transitions .",
