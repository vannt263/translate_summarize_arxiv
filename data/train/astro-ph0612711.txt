    "the most massive stars end their lives as core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the broad category of core - collapse sne is divided spectroscopically based on the presence or absence of h and he , with the sequence from strong h , to he and weak h , to only he , to lacking both h and he being ( respectively ) types ii , iib , ib , and ic ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "these correspond to progenitor stars with progressively decreasing h and he envelopes , with the mass loss caused by either stellar winds or mass transfer to a companion star .",
    "type iin sne @xcite are objects with narrow h emission lines , which are the result of the sn ejecta interacting with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are evolved , core he - burning stars near the end of their lives .",
    "they are thought to be the descendants of stars that begin their lives with initial masses @xmath1@xmath2 , which have already shed their h envelopes during a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stage @xcite , exposing their he cores ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this stage in stellar evolution ,",
    "the mass loss from stellar winds is @xmath0  @xmath3 yr@xmath4 , about 100 times higher than that of other o and b stars @xcite .",
    "although the wr stage lasts only @xmath0  @xmath5 years @xcite , a star can lose several solar masses of material during this stage .",
    "these facts suggest that wr stars are possible progenitors of stripped - envelope ( types iib through ic ) sne .",
    "@xcite showed that sn  1999cq had intermediate - width ( fwhm @xmath6 ) he emission lines similar to the hydrogen lines of sne  iin , but lacking h lines .",
    "they suggested that sn  1999cq was interacting with a csm of dense he , but little or no h. until now , only one other supernova , sn  2002ao @xcite , has been identified as having intermediate - width he emission lines @xcite .",
    "sn  2006jc was discovered in by amateur astronomers @xcite on 2006 oct .  9.75 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "a non - detection was reported on sep .",
    "22 , suggesting that the sn was discovered shortly after explosion .",
    "soon after detection , several groups obtained spectra of sn  2006jc and noted the presence of emission lines , but did not associate it with sn  1999cq @xcite .",
    "@xcite later reclassified sn  2006jc as type ia , before @xcite noted its similarity to sne  1999cq and 2002ao .",
    "in addition to optical photometry and spectroscopy presented in this letter , uv and x - ray data were obtained with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , with a positive x - ray detection , probably indicating cs interaction .",
    "further x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ @xcite confirm the _",
    "swift _ x - ray results .",
    "detailed study of the well - observed sn  2006jc presents an opportunity to examine the progenitor of a rare but important core - collapse sn spanning the gap between sne iin and ib , sampling the environment of a wr star at the end of its stellar life , and helping to clarify what appears to be a new subclass of sne .",
    "here we present optical photometry and spectroscopy and discuss the implications of those data .",
    "we also present observations of sn  2002ao in the interest of completeness , but leave a detailed analysis of all the data for a future paper .",
    "once the unusual nature of sn  2006jc was noted , we began a monitoring campaign that consisted of photometry with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and optical spectroscopy with the kast spectrograph @xcite mounted on the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope , the lris spectrograph @xcite mounted on the keck i 10-m telescope , and the deimos spectrograph @xcite mounted on the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "the multi - band photometry began on oct .",
    "11 while our first spectrum was obtained on oct .  24 .",
    "the photometry in this paper continues through dec .",
    "16 while our last spectrum in this paper was obtained on nov",
    ".  24 .",
    "all spectral data were reduced using standard techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using our own idl routines , we fit spectrophotometric standard star spectra to flux - calibrate our data and remove telluric lines @xcite .",
    "photometric data were obtained with kait and the 1-m nickel telescope at lick observatory .",
    "magnitudes were measured in the kron - johnson system using the point - spread function ( psf)-fitting photometry software @xcite in the iraf daophot package , as multi - color template images required for galaxy subtraction are not available and the sn is still visible in kait data .",
    "since sn  2006jc is bright and reasonably isolated from its faint host galaxy , galaxy subtraction is not necessary , and simple psf - fitting provides us a reasonable approach to reduce the photometry at this early time .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes for sn  2006jc derived this way are calibrated with several local standard stars based on a calibration from the photometric night of oct .  21 with the nickel telescope .",
    "we present our low - resolution spectra of sn  2006jc in figure  [ f : spec ] . in all spectra , we are able to identify intermediate - width , h@xmath7 , , , and emission lines .",
    "there are no photospheric p - cygni profiles typically found in early sn  ib / c spectra @xcite ; the spectra seem to consist of two continuum components ( red and blue ) and intermediate - width ( @xmath8 ) emission lines .",
    "the redder he lines show a intermediate - width emission component ( fwhm @xmath9 ) similar to , but slightly wider than , that of sne  iin @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ f : vel ] , the bluer he lines show narrow p - cygni profiles , with the absorption minimum blueshifted by roughly @xmath10 .",
    "the emission components of the lines with p - cygni profiles are narrower ( fwhm @xmath11 ) than the pure emission components , presumably because their blueshifted emission is self - absorbed .",
    "the only discernible characteristic between the groups of lines with the two different types of line profiles is wavelength ; in particular , the groups are not distinguished by singlet or triplet state .",
    "the line intensity ratios of the lines evolve with time , which may be an indication of changing densities or nlte effects .",
    "the spectra all show a relatively flat continuum redward of @xmath0  5500  , but a very steep blue continuum shortward of @xmath0  5500  , with a minimum @xmath12 color of @xmath13 mag .",
    "we have identified a few isolated lines in the spectra of sn  2006jc ( see figure  [ f : spec ] ) , suggesting that there are many other lines , mostly at short wavelengths .",
    "it is likely that most of the apparent blue `` continuum '' consists of blended fe lines .",
    "@xcite suggested that emission lines create the excess blue continuum of sn  1988z .",
    "the blending of the fe lines makes disentangling the lines difficult , and detailed modeling is necessary to fully interpret our data .",
    "however , the amplitudes of the undulations in the blue continuum become larger with time , despite no significant change in the continuum shape .",
    "if the apparent continuum is the result of blended fe lines , the increase of these amplitudes follows the expected result of lines increasing relative to the continuum ( as seen with isolated lines ) .",
    "there are still many features that we are unable to identify , most notably that centered at 6357   which may be @xmath14 , with fwhm @xmath15 .",
    "this feature has some substructure and is wider than other emission lines , and thus is likely a blend of several lines .",
    "while most emission lines increase relative to the continuum with time , this feature decreases dramatically relative to the continuum and disappears by our nov",
    ".  23 spectrum , which is likely an excitation effect .",
    "since the lines increase relative to the continuum with time , it is most likely some other element . the features at 7881    ( somewhat blended with @xmath16 ) , 8215   and 9360    exhibit the same behavior and width , and may be of the same species .",
    "the slope of the blue continuum of sn  2006jc does not change much with time .",
    "the emission components of all he lines increase relative to the continuum with time , while some other species , including , decrease with time .",
    "the ir triplet also increases with time , consistent with other sne .",
    "the evolution of the blue continuum is apparent in figure  [ f : lc ] .",
    "the @xmath17-band light curve declines more slowly than the other bands , which is unusual for a sn light curve .",
    "this supports the argument that the blue continuum is the result of a process not typically seen in sne .",
    "sn  2006jc has maximum absolute magnitudes of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 for , respectively , making it as luminous as sn  1994i @xcite .",
    "assuming that nearly all of its luminosity comes from @xmath21ni to @xmath21co to @xmath21fe decay , the fact that sne  1994i and 2006jc have similar luminosities suggests they created similar @xmath21ni masses , @xmath0  0.07 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the early - time decline rates of sne  2006jc , 2002ao , and 1999cq are much faster than those of normal sne  iin ( see figure  [ f : lc ] for a comparison to sn  iin 2002bu )",
    ". the early light curves of sne  iin are powered mainly by circumstellar interaction and their slow declines at early times indicate a massive csm . despite showing obvious features of circumstellar interaction in their spectra , sne  2006jc , 2002ao , and 1999cq all decline very quickly , suggesting an extremely dense , but low - mass and clumpy csm .",
    "the late - time decline rates of these objects are also very fast , indicating either a small @xmath21ni mass or a small ejecta mass .",
    "the strength of the intermediate - width emission lines in sn  2006jc relative to other sne  ib is indicative of a dense csm rich in he . similar to the h lines seen in sn  iin spectra , the he lines of sn  2006jc are the result of the sn ejecta interacting with a dense csm .",
    "the lines seen only in emission have fwhm @xmath23 20003000  km  s@xmath4 , and the absorption minimum of the p - cygni profiles is @xmath0  1000  km  s@xmath4 , velocities typical of wr winds @xcite .",
    "the identification of h@xmath7 suggests that the progenitor recently ejected material containing at least some h into its surroundings , perhaps meaning that the progenitor recently evolved from a lbv to a wne wr star @xcite .",
    "additionally , the smaller width of the h@xmath7 line is consistent with a different ejection mechanism from that of the he .",
    "lbvs typically have slower expansion speeds than wr stars , indicating that the h might have been ejected during the lbv stage , while the he was ejected during the wr stage .",
    "@xcite did not see any h@xmath7 in the spectrum of sn  1999cq , but the low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum makes the measurement ambiguous .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2002ao does show relatively strong h@xmath7 ( see figure  [ f : spec ] ) , suggesting that its csm contains more h than that of sn  2006jc .    as noted by @xcite",
    ", there was a bright ( @xmath24 mag ) outburst coincident with the position of sn  2006jc in oct .",
    "2004 , which was initially thought to be an lbv outburst similar to sn  1961v @xcite . unless it was a mere coincidence",
    ", it seems that the progenitor of sn  2006jc suffered an event analogous to the non - terminal eruptions of lbvs shortly before final core collapse , ejecting a he - rich shell with which the sn ejecta are now interacting .",
    "the short time between these events may have far - reaching implications for the late evolution of massive stars , beyond what we can discuss here ; however , it is worth noting that @xcite determined that sn  iin  1994w had an outburst @xmath0  1.5 years prior to explosion .",
    "equally surprising is that this type of event may have happened in a star inferred to be a wn star ; while such outbursts are known to occur in lbvs that still have their h envelopes , no such variability has been documented in wn stars .",
    "it may hint that the progenitor of sn  2006jc had just recently transitioned from the lbv to the wn stage , supporting the notion that lbv mass loss facilitates the onset of the wr phase .",
    "this would seem consistent with the presence of h in its csm .",
    "the slow @xmath17-band decline relative to the @xmath25 band , the steep blue continuum , and the p - cygni profiles for all suggest that the emission at wavelengths shorter than @xmath0  5500   arises from a mechanism that is different from that which produces the red continuum .",
    "we identified some isolated lines , suggesting that many other lines are present in the spectrum , but are blended and appear as a pseudo - continuum because of their large line widths .",
    "since we do not see other high - excitation lines , this emission might be provided by fluorescence and not collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite noted that sn  1999cq had a bluer continuum than normal sne  ic .",
    "they also noted that sn  1999cq had @xmath26 mag , and argued that @xmath27 mag .",
    "similarly , sn  2002ao may be extinguished . correcting for reasonably small reddening , the continua of both sne  1999cq and 2002ao have similar colors to that of sn  2006jc , indicating that these events may also have a strong blue continuum .",
    "the main difference between the spectra is the strong h&k absorption in sn  1999cq .",
    "the double - peaked nature of some lines suggest a complex , asymmetric csm .",
    "unlike sne  iin , the light curve of sn  2006jc declined very quickly , suggesting that there is little mass in the csm .",
    "however , the strong emission lines indicate a very dense csm .",
    "these facts are compatible if the csm is asymmetric or clumpy . also , the p - cygni profiles seen only for the blue lines also indicate asymmetry , because the blue continuum is absorbed by the he gas , whereas the red continuum ( presumably from the inner sn debris ) is not .    a simple way to explain these observables is supernova ejecta interacting with a bipolar csm , which causes the double - peaked nature of the he lines .",
    "the he - rich csm , which was likely the result of the recent ( 2004 ) outburst , may be asymmetric because of either rapid rotation in the progenitor or strong interaction with a binary companion .",
    "some of the data presented herein were obtained at the w. m. keck observatory , which was made possible by the generous financial support of the w. m. keck foundation .",
