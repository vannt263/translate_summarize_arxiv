    "@xcite argued that the measurement at 2.7 ghz by @xcite is too low and suggested that the integrated spectrum might have no tendency to steepen as suggested by @xcite ; however , this strong steepening of the radio spectrum at high frequencies was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the radio data at 1380 mhz @xcite and 326 mhz @xcite to derive the radial distribution of the spectral index in coma c , and they found a central  plateau \" with a size of @xmath2 for the spectral - index distribution . in the central region ,",
    "the value of the spectral index is @xmath3 ; in the outside region , the spectral index strongly steepens as the radius increases .",
    "observations with _",
    "bepposax _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) have detected a hard x - ray ( hxr ) excess with respect to thermal emission from the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the hxr excesses from several other clusters have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the most favored mechanism of the hxr excess is inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by relativistic electrons .",
    "since these electrons with energy @xmath4 will also produce radio synchrotron radiation , the hxr excesses and radio halos may originate from the same electron population . in the coma cluster ,",
    "the volume - averaged values of magnetic fields deduced from the comparison of the radio with the hxr excess emission is @xmath5 0.10.3 @xmath0 g @xcite .",
    "these low values of field strength are not consistent with those deduced from the measurements of faraday rotation . @xcite",
    "have shown that many clusters have relatively large ( @xmath5 48 @xmath0 g ) fields .",
    "for the coma cluster , @xcite found a central field strength of @xmath6 g , and @xcite estimated the strength to be @xmath7 g .",
    "it is thus very important to see whether it is possible to produce the observed hxr excess via the inverse compton mechanism with such a high central magnetic field .",
    "nonetheless , some uncertainties in both methods may lead to the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the hxr excess is non - thermal bremsstrahlung from supra - thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "however , a huge amount of energy is necessary in this model to produce the observed hxr excess @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a two - phase model to interpret the radial steepening of the spectral - index distribution in coma c. in this two - phase model , the relativistic electrons were injected during a first phase in the past and re - accelerated during a second phase up to present time . in such a re - acceleration model , there must be a cutoff in the electron spectrum because of the balance between the loss and the gain of the electron energy .",
    "a cutoff in the electron spectrum should lead to a cutoff in the emissivity of synchrotron radiation and then in the integrated radio spectrum .",
    "if the magnetic fields have a radial - decrease profile , the cutoff frequencies will decrease with the increasing radius .",
    "consequently , a radial steepening of the spectral index between two fixed frequencies will appear .",

    "the authors adopted a central field strength of @xmath8 g in their models .",
    "as pointed in their work , the spectral index would be very steep in low magnetic fields and flat in moderate ones",
    ". it would be important to know whether a stronger central magnetic field can reproduce the central  plateau \" in the spectral - index distribution without violating the observational constraints from the radio and hxr emission .",
    "cluster mergers are very violent events and release a large amount of energy ( @xmath9 ergs ) .",
    "merger shocks and violent turbulence must play an important role in the generation and re - acceleration of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite claimed that the shocks generated by major mergers , mergers between clusters with comparable mass , is too weak to account for the spectral slopes of the non - thermal emission .",
    "the mach numbers of the shocks in major mergers are of order of unity in their simulations and roughly consistent with the mach number @xmath5 2 observed in cygnus a @xcite . however ,",
    "if a significant level of re - acceleration is involved , the evolved spectra of relativistic electrons may be able to account for the observed spectra of non - thermal emission .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the radio and hxr excess emission in the coma cluster assuming the magnetic fields possessing a central field strength of @xmath10 g and a radial - decrease profile .",
    "the effects of different mach numbers of merger shocks on the formation of radio halos and hxr excesses are also investigated .",
    "we assume that relativistic electrons are injected by merger shocks and re - accelerated by ensuing violent turbulence .",
    "the turbulence is expected to be more violent at the moment right after the merger shocks and then gradually decays with time @xcite ; therefore , particles in the icm might obtain stronger re - acceleration in the early period of mergers and then , following the decay of turbulence , the strength of re - acceleration would decrease . in this work ,",
    "both time - independent and time - dependent re - acceleration models are considered .",
    "the radial variation of the spectral index of synchrotron radiation in the coma cluster is computed to test the scenarios of the cosmic - ray electron re - acceleration . in particular , we try to obtain a central  plateau \" in the spectral - index distribution that is in agreement with observational results reported by @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the production of an hxr excess with the assumption that the hxr excess is due to ics of the cmb photons by the cosmic - ray electron distribution that we obtained from the spectral index fitting . comparing the modelling results with the observations , we find that the mach numbers of the merger shocks have to be in a very small range to form the radio halo and the hxr excess observed in the coma cluster .    in this paper , @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 is assumed .",

    "the general form of the acceleration function @xmath33 is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the amplification factor and the dissipation factor , respectively .",
    "the cases with @xmath39 are called time - independent acceleration , and the cases with @xmath40 and @xmath41 are called time - dependent acceleration . according to the numerical work of @xcite , the maximum temperature of mergers is @xmath42 three times of the initial temperature before merging and returns to that when the passed times after merging are greater than 1 gyr . because the sources for heating gas are turbulence and shocks generated by merging , it is reasonable to relate the temperature variation with the turbulence strength , i.e. , the strength of re - acceleration .",
    "thus we choose the values of the amplification factor @xmath37 and the dissipation factor @xmath38 under the constraint that the maximum value of @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 , is @xmath42 3 and the value of @xmath43 is @xmath5 1 when @xmath45 1 gyr in our models .    the re - acceleration model in the two - phase model proposed by @xcite is a time - independent acceleration model in our classification . @xcite suggested that the re - acceleration function ( @xmath46 in their eq.[16 ] corresponding to @xmath47 here ) can be parameterized as the sum of a uniform large - scale component and a small - scale component and assumed that the uniform large - scale component is caused by shocks and/or turbulence , possibly generated during a recent merger , and the small - scale component assumed to be proportional to the inverse of the typical distance between galaxies is due to the amplification of these shocks / turbulence by the motion of the massive galaxies in the cluster core .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the acceleration component @xmath48 in the re - acceleration function @xmath47 is due to turbulence and spatially uniform in the cluster .",
    "the lower - hybrid - wave turbulence proposed by @xcite is a possible scenario for this kind of re - acceleration .",
    "they showed that large amplitude alfvn waves do generate lower hybrid waves which collapse to produce localized , intense wave packets , and even a modest level of lower hybrid turbulence can be very effective at accelerating relativistic particles .",
    "for the @xmath49 component ( corresponding to the small - scale component in the two - phase model ) , we assume that this is caused by the orbiting motion of galaxies . according to the work of @xcite , the excited turbulent motions of icm are related to the galaxy density in the cluster and vary as @xmath50 , so that we assume @xmath51 .",

    "our results indicate that the models with time - dependent re - acceleration have effects on the brightness distribution similar to those with flatter initial electron spectra .",

    "nonetheless , time - dependent models can still fit the integrated radio spectra and the hxr excess emission better . combining the results from the time - independent and time - dependent models , we find that only merger shocks with mach numbers , @xmath120 , i.e. , the power - law index @xmath121 , can reproduce the results agreeing with the observations in the coma cluster .",
    "as shown in the modelling results , a central  plateau \" in the spectral - index distribution can be produced in clusters with a central field strength of 6 @xmath0 g .",
    "to understand the origin of this characteristic feature of the radio emission of coma c , we use the results of model a6 as an example and show the electron spectra and the radio emissivity of this model at different locations in figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the electrons in the central regions are strongly accelerated to the cutoff energies and flat spectra can be formed within the central @xmath122 regions .",
    "the ratios between the radio emissivity at 326 mhz and that at 1380 mhz are almost equal within the central regions and , at these two frequencies , the radio emissivity within the central regions dominates over that outside this regions ; thus a central  plateau \" may form in the spectral - index distribution . outside the central region , the electron spectra are not very different from one another because the effects are mainly from the inverse compton losses and the spatially uniform re - acceleration , and then the differences between the radio emissivity at different locations are mainly due to the variations of the magnetic fields . as the radius increases , the high - frequency emissivity gradually decreases because of weaker magnetic fields ; therefore , the progressive steepening of the spectral index is presented .",
    "naturally , it should also exist a decline at high frequencies in the integrated radio spectrum as proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the size of the  plateau \" is almost equal to the region where the magnetic field is @xmath123 3 @xmath0 g ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this fact might indicate that the formation of this  plateau \" is related to the situation that the synchrotron losses dominate over the inverse compton losses ( e.g. , brunetti et al .",
    "the  plateau \" should be produced by the combination of the radial setting of re - acceleration and that of magnetic fields .",
    "as discussed in previous paragraph , when the inverse compton losses dominate , it is impossible to obtain a flat  plateau \" because the radius - dependent magnetic fields will cause the high - frequency emissivity to decrease as the radius increase . in other words , it is possible to obtain a flat spectral index  plateau \" in our models only when the synchrotron losses dominate over the inverse compton losses . if a central  plateau \" presents in the spectral - index distribution , the central strength of the cluster magnetic field should be greater than 3 @xmath0 g .",
    "note that since a central  plateau \" can exist only in a period in the evolution of radio halos , a central  plateau \" in the spectral - index distribution may be absent even a cluster possessing a high central field .",
    "the emissivity of the hxr excess of the model a6 is shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "obviously , the hxr excess is mainly contributed from the outer regions of the cluster volume ( @xmath124 ) as indicated by @xcite .",
    "this might reconcile the problem that the volume - averaged magnetic fields derived from the hxr excesses are usually much lower than the magnetic fields from the faraday rotation measurements .",
    "however , we note that the average magnetic field in the core regions adopted here is @xmath42 2 @xmath0 g while the magnetic fields from the faraday rotation measurements are @xmath125 6 @xmath0 g",

    "the magnetic fields are @xmath5 48 @xmath0 g out to @xmath5 0.75 mpc from cluster centers @xcite .",
    "we note that the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters might have a higher value and a flatter profile in the core region than the adopted model .",
    "a higher magnetic field requires a stronger re - acceleration to sustain the radio emission . to produce a  plateau \" distribution of the spectral index for a higher magnetic field with a flatter profile , the re - acceleration function need to be almost constant over the region",
    "this indicates that the re - acceleration caused by the galaxy motions might be negligible .",
    "the ics of the cmb photons by relativistic electrons is also suggested as the mechanism of the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) excess in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "however , the euv excess possesses a narrow radial profile and concentrates in the inner regions of the cluster @xcite , while the hxr excess is mainly contributed from the outer regions of the cluster volume as shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "it is thus inadequate to assume that the euv - emitting electrons are also from the outside and low - magnetic - field regions of the cluster .",
    "@xcite investigated the euv excess with a @xmath126 g field ; they showed that it is possible to explain the euv excess and the radio emission with such a high average magnetic field .",
    "the euv - emitting electrons and the radio / hxr - emitting electrons could have very different distributions because the low - energy euv - emitting electrons suffer much less energy losses during their evolution and can accumulate over a much longer age .",

    "the size of the  plateau \" is almost equal to the region where the synchrotron loss dominates over the inverse compton loss , i.e. , the magnetic field is @xmath123 3 @xmath0 g .",
    "our models can naturally produce the observed radial steepening of the radio spectral index .",
    "we can fit the integrated radio spectra very well , in particular , we can reproduce the high - frequency decline feature in the spectra as measured by @xcite .",
    "these same models can also produce the observed hxr excess , which is mainly from the outer regions of the cluster volume as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that only merger shocks with mach numbers in a very small range can produce results agreeing with the observations of the radio and hxr emission in the coma cluster .",
    "the mach numbers are @xmath127 , corresponding to the initial electron power - law index @xmath121 , which are consistent with simulations and observations of merger shocks .",
    "we have adopted a artificial magnetic field distribution in our calculation .",
    "the real magnetic field might be higher and have a flatter distribution than the adopted model .",
    "it is possible to obtain similar results for a higher magnetic field with a stronger re - acceleration .",
    "however , it might be have problems to produce the observed hxr excess within the ics scheme for such a high magnetic field .",
    "we are grateful to s. bowyer for a careful reading of the manuscript and several suggestions that helped to improve this paper .",
    "we thank f. govoni for kindly providing the data of the coma radio profile .",
