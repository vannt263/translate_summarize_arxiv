    "<S> recent numerical simulations of lid  driven cavity flow of a nematic liquid crystal have found dynamical behavior where topological defects rotate about the center of the fluid vortex induced by the lid motion . by considering a simpler geometry of an infinite system with axisymmetric fluid flow </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ericksen  </S>",
    "<S> leslie nematodynamic equation for the director can be solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the solution demonstrates that any configuration of defects will be advected by the fluid flow , with the defects rotating about the center of the fluid vortex with the angular velocity of the fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> lid  driven cavity flow is a standard geometry used in both experimental and computational studies of fluids . in this geometry </S>",
    "<S> a fluid is contained within a box whose sides are stationary except for the the top wall ( the  lid \" ) which is driven at some nonzero velocity . in numerical studies </S>",
    "<S> the problem is often simplified to a two  dimensional square domain with one moving side . </S>",
    "<S> the driven lid creates a vortex fluid flow near the center of the cavity as well as counterrotating vortices near the corners . </S>",
    "<S> if the fluid is a complex one , such as a nematic liquid crystal , the driven lid can lead to very interesting and rich topological defect phenomena as has been observed recently in a number of numerical simulation studies @xcite . among the phenomena observed are rotating half  </S>",
    "<S> integer charged topological defects , either a single defect @xcite or a pair of oppositely charged defects @xcite , depending on the director boundary conditions employed . </S>",
    "<S> the defects are advected by the fluid vortex near the center of the cavity and undergo a periodic rotation with the fluid flow about the center of the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of a single defect @xcite the defect core eventually settles at the center of the vortex and remains stationary , while in the case of a defect pair @xcite the defects continue to rotate indefinitely with other transient defect phenomena occuring elsewhere in the cavity .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that by considering a simpler but related geometry the ericksen  </S>",
    "<S> leslie nematodynamic equation for the director can be solved exactly for any texture composed of an array of defects . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is consistent with the behavior observed in the simulations , namely , advection of the defects about the center of the fluid vortex with an angular speed equal to that of the fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider a nematic liquid crystal with a simple vortex fluid flow ( a  stationary axisymmetric flow \" ) given in plane polar coordinates by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 measures the radial distance from the center of the vortex and @xmath2 is the tangential polar unit vector . </S>",
    "<S> the angular speed of the fluid @xmath3 is the magnitude of the angular velocity : @xmath4 we assume that the system is infinite in size , thus simplifying the cavity flow geometry while retaining the essence of the lid  driven flow , namely , the central vortex . for this vortex flow </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric velocity tensor @xmath5 is identically zero and the ericksen  </S>",
    "<S> leslie hydrodynamic equation for the nematic director @xcite simplifies to : @xmath6 assuming a single frank elastic constant @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 are leslie viscosity coefficients and @xmath9 is the rotation rate of the director relative to the moving fluid : @xmath10 the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 maintains the constraint : @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the director field lies in the plane of the fluid flow ( the @xmath13 plane ) and express it in rectangular coordinates by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle @xmath16 makes with the @xmath17 axis . substituting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vortex ] ) and ( [ n ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_1 ] ) the two nonzero components of the latter equation are found to be : @xmath18+a \\omega\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\label{eq : d_8a } \\gamma\\sin\\theta & = & -a \\cos\\theta   \\left(-\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial t } + \\omega y \\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x } - \\omega x \\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   & & -k \\left[-\\sin\\theta\\left ( \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 \\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\left.\\cos\\theta \\left ( \\frac{\\partial ^2\\theta}{\\partial x^2}+ \\frac{\\partial ^{2}\\theta}{\\partial y^{2 } } \\right)\\right]-a \\omega\\cos\\theta\\\\ \\label{eq : d_8b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 . after eliminating the unknown lagrange multiplier @xmath11 from the above two equations </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath20 the left hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_9 ] ) is the time rate of change of the director angle @xmath15 relative to the rotating fluid @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if initially @xmath21 , a condition satisfied at all points in space by any configuration of topological defects except at the isolated defect cores @xcite , then eq .  ( [ eq : d_9 ] ) requires that the time rate of change of @xmath15 relative to the rotating fluid is zero , i.e. , @xmath15 as a function of the polar coordinates in the nonrotating frame must satisfy : @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 thus , if there are topological defects in the system initially the director pattern will rotate with the fluid , i.e. , the defects will rotate with same angular velocity @xmath25 as the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation is the exact solution to the ericksen  </S>",
    "<S> leslie director equation for an axisymmetric flow and an initial director configuration satisfying @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> while the latter equation is not satisfied at the defect core itself , the core must rotate at the angular velocity as the director field surrounding it to preserve the continuity of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> also , note that this solution is stable against director fluctuations out of the plane as can be seen from looking at the @xmath26 component of eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_1 ] ) .    in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : singlehalfmotion ] and [ fig : halfpairmotion ] we illustrate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_13 ] ) for two cases : a single half  integer defect and a pair of oppositely charged half  integer defects , configurations that were observed in the numerical simulations of lid  driven cavity flow in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in both figures </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath27 , where the negative sign corresponds to the clockwise fluid flow imposed in the simulations by a lid driven in the positive @xmath17 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the figures illustrate the periodic rotation of the defects with period @xmath28 as observed in the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this is the steady  state motion for the axisymmetric infinite system considered in this paper . in the simulation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the single defect eventually settled to the center of the vortex ; this behavior arises presumably from the presence of the defects at the corners of the cavity leading to an equilibrium position of the rotating defect at the vortex center . in the case of the rotating pair of defects @xcite the rotation </S>",
