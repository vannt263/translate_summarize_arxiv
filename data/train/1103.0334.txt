    "crystallization frequently happens in a ` multi - stage ' manner , with a parent phase ( e.g. a solution ) first transforming into an intermediate phase ( e.g. a dense liquid ) before the stable solid emerges  @xcite .",
    "one of the few guidelines we have for predicting when crystallization intermediates will appear is ostwald s rule of stages , which states that the parent phase will first transform into the phase closest to it in free energy  @xcite .",
    "it is widely upheld .",
    "for instance , sulfur crystallizes from solution by first forming a dense liquid  @xcite .",
    "melts  @xcite and aerosols  @xcite also display expected precursors of the stable crystal . on the computer , a microscopic analog of the rule is seen : the freezing of polar fluids , model proteins  @xcite and molecular nitrogen  @xcite can all take place via nuclei whose composition reflects that of an intermediate phase .",
    "but the rule has no theoretical foundation  @xcite and is not universally obeyed .",
    "amino acid crystallization  @xcite , the simulated freezing of molecular co@xmath0  @xcite and potts model phase transformations  @xcite can all take place _ without _ involvement of metastable polymorphs .",
    "further , simulations of charged colloids  @xcite show that sluggish dynamics can invalidate the closely - related stranski - totomanow conjecture  @xcite , the prediction that the first phase seen is the one separated from the parent phase by the smallest free energy barrier .",
    "the limitations of these rules of thumb motivate us to look for connections between crystallization pathways and _ microscopic _ features of particle interactions and dynamics .",
    "here we study a lattice model of anisotropic particles .",
    "our model is designed to mimic , in a generic way , the ability of materials such as proteins  @xcite and ions  @xcite to crystallize by first forming a _ disordered _ phase .",
    "it is also designed to be simple enough to allow thorough assessment of how its microscopic parameters control its crystallization behavior .",
    "here we describe this behavior in detail .",
    "we show where in phase space ostwald s rule is likely to hold , and where it is likely to fail .",
    "because the essence of the microscopic features of our model are common to a wide range of physical systems , the trends we have identifed might be used as a guide to select particular crystallization pathways in simulation and experiment .",
    "we consider a collection of particles that live on a featureless two - dimensional substrate , which we model as a square lattice .",
    "lattice sites may be vacant or be occupied by a particle .",
    "nearest - neighbor particles receive a ` nonspecific ' interaction energy reward of @xmath1 .",
    "particles are anisotropic , and can point in any of @xmath2 discrete directions .",
    "neighboring particles receive an additional ` specific ' energy reward of @xmath3 if they are aligned , and a penalty of @xmath4 if they are antialigned .",
    "the larger is @xmath2 , the more precisely must two particles align before they receive the specific binding reward ( we shall explore the effect of varying @xmath2 ) . each particle on the substrate feels a chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "we simulated our model using the monte carlo procedure described in appendix a. this procedure allows particles to translate ( adsorb to and desorb from the substrate ) , and to rotate in place on the substrate .",
    "we have explored the effect of varying extensively the relative rate @xmath6 of proposing rotation and translation moves , because we expect rotational and translational mobilities to vary considerably from one material to another .",
    "for instance , the limit of slow rotations ( @xmath7 ) might be appropriate for particles , like dna - linked colloids , that must unbind in order to rotate appreciably  @xcite .",
    "it is also likely that particles of different sizes explore their positional and angular interaction ranges at different rates  @xcite .",
    "we used this procedure in concert with umbrella sampling  @xcite to calculate free energy landscapes for crystallization ( biasing the size and degree of crystallinity of the system s largest cluster  @xcite ) , and in concert with transition path sampling  @xcite and forward flux sampling  @xcite to generate dynamical crystallization trajectories .",
    "the combination of these methods reveals the distinct effect on crystallization of thermodynamics and dynamics .",

    "we show the phase diagram of the model as a function of interaction strengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for angular specificity @xmath10 .",

    "intermediate particles , with 13 parallel neighbors , are blue - green .",
    "when both interactions are weak the stable phase is a homogeneous fluid phase ( h ) of moderate density and little orientational order .",

    "demixing ' into a sparse vapor v and a dense liquid l ( both orientationally disordered ) can be induced by application of a strong nonspecific attraction , @xmath8 ( the critical point on the horizontal axis is the regular ising model one ) .",

    "we are interested in the region of solid stability to the right of the demixing line . there",
    ", the sparse vapor phase lies above the dense fluid phase in free energy , which in turn lies above the stable solid phase .",
    "ostwald s rule suggests that if we start from the vapor phase then the liquid will emerge prior to crystallization .",
    "but as we describe below , this is not always true .",
    "the thermodynamically - favored critical nucleus is liquidlike below the horizontal red line , but crystalline above it .",

    "[ fig2 ] . at point a in phase space , only phases h and s are viable , and crystallization is straightforward",
    ": it consists of the direct transformation of h into s. at point b on the phase diagram ( in our regime of interest ) an empty substrate immediately becomes host to the metastable low - density vapor .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the free energy of formation from the vapor of a dense nucleus as a function of nucleus size @xmath14 and the number of crystalline particles @xmath15 it contains .",
    "the minimum energy pathway ( ` mep ' , solid line ) from the vapor to the crystal is an _ indirect",
    "_ one ( sometimes called a ` two - step ' or ` nonclassical ' pathway ) that displays a liquidlike critical nucleus .",
    "the direct pathway ( dashed line ) via a crystalline critical nucleus is disfavored by about 15 @xmath16 .",
    "the indirect pathway is made possible by the intermediate liquid phase , but because we are far from the demixing line is not a result of critical density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "dynamical trajectories generated using a wide range of particle rotation rates adhere to the indirect pathway ( red line , fast rotation : @xmath17 ; blue line , slow rotation : @xmath18 ) : a liquid nucleates on the substrate , and only subsequently does the crystal emerge from the liquid .",
    "for rapid rates of rotation the postcritical liquid readily transforms into a crystal while still only of small size http://nanotheory.lbl.gov/people/mwnn_paper/point_b_fast.mp4[m1 ] , while for sluggish rotation rates the liquid consumes the substrate , and fails to crystallize during the course of the simulation http://nanotheory.lbl.gov/people/mwnn_paper/point_b_slow.mp4[m2 ] .    at point c in phase space",
    "the liquid remains intermediate in free energy between the parent phase and the stable solid , but the driving force for crystallization is qualitatively different : the _ direct _ pathway , with a crystalline critical nucleus , is preferred ! the indirect pathway with a liquidlike critical nucleus is still viable , but is disfavored by about @xmath19 . because of this relatively small discrepancy in barrier heights , both pathways can be seen in dynamic simulations . for a sufficiently fast rotation rate ( red line , @xmath17 )",
    "the direct pathway is taken : a crystal nucleates and grows on the substrate .",
    "no liquid is seen . for a slow rotation rate ( blue line , @xmath18 ) the indirect pathway _",
    "is _ seen , and the substrate is again consumed by a liquid , http://nanotheory.lbl.gov/people/mwnn_paper/point_c_fast.mp4[m3 ] , http://nanotheory.lbl.gov/people/mwnn_paper/point_c_slow.mp4[m4 ] , and  [ figa3 ] .",
    "a relic of the liquid phase therefore influences the crystallization pathway some way past the freezing line , but eventually thermodynamics favors a direct mode of crystallization : the critical nucleus is crystalline above the horizontal red line on the phase diagram of fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the question of how much liquid is seen in simulations is one that can not be addressed by ostwald s rule ( ` or ' in caption ) . assuming that it applies ( it pertains to metastable intermediate phases , and the liquid at b and c is at most weakly so ) , it is satisfied in a macroscopic sense by the ` slow rotation ' ( blue ) trajectories at point b , but only in a microscopic sense by the ` fast rotation ' ( red ) trajectories .",
    "it is violated by the ` fast ' trajectories at c , but not by the ` slow ' trajectories . moreover , the latter involve passage over a free energy barrier larger than the smallest available , going against the sense of the stranski - totomanow conjecture ( ` st ' in caption ) .",
    "the microscopic thermodynamic control of our model s crystallization pathway is the competition between the angular specificity @xmath2 and potency @xmath9 of specific binding . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show that the thermodynamically - preferred composition of the critical nucleus ( and of small nuclei of specified size ) is liquidlike for small @xmath9 ( just above the freezing line ) , and becomes increasingly crystalline as one increases @xmath9 : this trend acts _ against _ the sense of ostwald s rule .",
    "by contrast , increasing @xmath2 acts in _ favor _ of ostwald s rule : as @xmath2 grows , the liquid becomes more strongly metastable to crystallization , giving rise to free energy barriers that hinder the transformation of a liquid droplet into a solid one ( compare surfaces top right and top left ) .",
    "interestingly , we can anticipate these thermodynamic trends using simple microscopic theory .",
    "we calculated analytically ( see appendix b ) the model s bulk free energy @xmath20 , in a self - consistent mean - field approximation , as a function of order parameters @xmath21 ( density ) and @xmath22 ( crystallinity ) :    @xmath23\\right).\\ ] ]    here @xmath24 is the lattice coordination number . from",
    "we obtained the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which resembles qualitatively its simulated counterpart .",
    "the microscopic parameters of the model control distinct critical behaviors , but they also shape the bulk free energy landscape even in regimes _ away _ from any phase transition . furthermore , previous work reveals that the bulk free energy landscape suggests the qualitative character of the thermodynamically - preferred crystallization pathway  @xcite : bulk wells indicate driving forces for appearance of phases , and bulk barriers are an important component of droplet surface tensions in a cahn - hilliard approximation . on bulk surfaces we calculated the minimum energy pathways between parent and solid phases",
    "( shown by white dashed lines on surfaces at points a , b , c ) , and shaded the phase diagram according to how ` direct ' are those pathways .",
    "the resulting ` pathway diagram ' describes qualitatively the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization for given microscopic parameters , and mirrors the changes of cluster composition seen in our umbrella sampling ( thermodynamic ) simulations : indirect crystallization pathways become viable to the right of the demixing line , and are supplanted by a direct mechanism some distance above the freezing line .",
    "this correspondence is a central result of this paper .",
    "this change of mechanism takes place in a regime of phase space in which the hierarchy of stable phase remains unchanged : in other words , the _ phase _ diagram in this regime is featureless , but the _ pathway _ diagram is not .",
    "the analytic theory allows a comprehensive survey of parameter space . increasing @xmath2",
    ", the number of accessible orientational states , has the effect of increasing the bulk free energy barrier between crystal and liquid phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , a trend reflected in simulations of finite - size clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows pathway diagrams for three particles with different value of @xmath2 , which display similar trends ( though a stronger specific interaction is needed to effect a change of pathway for large @xmath2 ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ figa6 ] shows the relation between the @xmath25 phase diagram and the conventional temperature - density one .",
    "the analytic estimate of pathway is a useful starting point for directing simulations , but it contains no dynamical information : we have seen in simulations that sluggish rotational dynamics can render the actual crystallization mechanism different to the thermodynamically - preferred one .",
    "we have identified the microscopic controls of crystallization in a model of anisotropic particles that can form both disordered and crystalline phases .",
    "our work complements previous studies that reveal how changes of intensive parameters , such as temperature  @xcite and pressure  @xcite , can change crystallization pathways in model systems .",
    "although rules of thumb are of limited use in predicting our model s crystallization pathway , a combination of simulation and analytic theory reveals that a liquid phase is likely to be seen prior to crystallization if 1 ) particles rotate sluggishly ; 2 ) if particles must align precisely in order to crystallize ( i.e. if @xmath2 is large ) ; and 3 ) if the specific attraction @xmath9 is just strong enough to render the crystal stable ( but not so strong as to render small droplets of crystal lower in free energy than droplets of liquid of similar size ) . while our model is idealized , and certainly does not capture the detailed microscopics of the way real particles interact ,",
    "it does show that the type of complex crystallization pathway observed in many experiments emerges as soon as one assigns to a particle a translational degree of freedom and a rotational one .",
    "further , while we expect differences in the details of particle interactions in two- and three dimensions , the correspondence of mean field theory ( which tends to work better the higher the dimension ) and simulation results , and related dynamic ` crossovers ' seen in three - dimensional models  @xcite , suggest that the results of this study are not limited to two - dimensional systems . with this in mind , we conjecture that the observations made here might be used as a starting point to guide experiments .",
    "for instance , they suggest that one could control the crystallization pathway of a protein if one could devise ways of altering , independently , that protein s nonspecific attraction ` @xmath8 ' ( e.g. using peg ) and specific attraction ` @xmath9 ' and ` @xmath2 ' ( e.g. through mutation or using multivalent salt  @xcite ) .",
    "one might also design anisotropic nanoparticles of specific rotational and translational mobilities in order to encourage a direct or indirect crystallization pathway .",
    "finally , we used the ` pathway diagram ' of fig .",

    "the value of @xmath9 is such that we sit just above the freezing line for each @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for @xmath10 ) . in all cases the pathway observed is an indirect one from vapor ( v ) to liquid ( l ) to solid ( s ) .",
