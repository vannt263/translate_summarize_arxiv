    "the detection of very high energy cosmic neutrinos , above , is important as it may allow to identify the most powerful sources in the universe .    in the first place , neutrinos , due to their small cross - section",
    "can travel cosmological distances without interactions .",
    "hence they might carry astrophysical information about their sources which are commonly believed to be optically thick  @xcite .",
    "second , due to their connection to the emission of cosmic nuclei and gamma rays , they might help to solve the problem of the origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "in fact although the existence of uhecrs is experimentally proven , their composition and origin are still unknown .",
    "many models have been proposed to explain the origin of uhecrs . some of these , which involve mechanisms of particle acceleration ( _ bottom - up _ ) , claim that they might be produced by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb )  @xcite . in such scenarios neutrinos could be produced with an upper flux limit given by the waxman - bahcall ( wb ) bound  @xcite .",
    "other models claim that uhecrs might come from the decay of super - massive objects ( _ top - down _ ) : these objects are expected to be produced by radiation , interaction or collapse of _ topological defects _ such as monopoles , cosmic strings , etc .",
    "the topological defect models predict a larger flux of photons and neutrinos arriving at earth than the _ bottom - up _ models .",
    "finally , high energy neutrinos could be also produced through pion decay when protons interact with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "these neutrinos are so - called _ cosmogenic neutrinos _  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to their vacuum oscillations  @xcite , a flux of high energy cosmic neutrinos is expected to be almost equally distributed among the three neutrino flavours .",
    "therefore the study of oscillation effects on high energy neutrino fluxes can be used to study the neutrino mixing and distinguish amongst different mass schemes .    according to the models described above , a low incoming flux of neutrinos is expected .",
    "in addition , neutrinos have a small interaction probability .",
    "therefore , in order to get a detectable rate , very large neutrino detectors are needed such as the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for auger observatory earth - skimming @xmath0 showers are the best suited candidates to produce detectable showers",
    ". studies of such possibilities were recently presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper to exemplify the potential and the features of the developed simulation tool we study neutrino induced extensive air showers ( eas ) focusing on the fluorescence detector ( fd ) set up at the pierre auger observatory .",
    "taking into account the details of the neutrino propagation inside the earth and in the atmosphere as well as the topography of the pierre auger observatory site , the directional dependence of the neutrino rate for up - going and down - going neutrino showers ( probability maps ) are evaluated accounting for the 10% duty cycle for the fd .",
    "the wb bound is used as an initial neutrino flux .",
    "we use the ellipsoidal model of the earth based on the so - called datum wgs84  @xcite model .",
    "in addition , we use an elevation map of the mountains surrounding the auger site .",
    "we find that the shape of the surrounding area influences significantly the calculated neutrino rates .",
    "to investigate the response of the fd for up - going showers , we generate the longitudinal profiles of shower development using the eas mc generator aires  @xcite .",
    "the light propagation and the hardware detector trigger are simulated by means of the auger software framework called offline  @xcite .",

    "the software tool used in the present paper is based on the code anis ( all neutrino interaction simulation )  @xcite .",
    "anis is a code originally developed by a.  gazizov and m.  p.  kowalski for the complete simulation chain of neutrino propagation and interaction in the context of the amanda experiment  @xcite .",
    "it allows to generate @xmath3-events of all flavours , to propagate them through the earth and finally to simulate @xmath4interactions within a specified volume inside the earth .",
    "all relevant standard model processes ( charged current ( cc ) , neutral current ( nc ) @xmath5-interactions and resonant @xmath6 scattering ) are implemented .",
    "in addition , neutrino regeneration at all orders is included .",
    "the density profile of the earth is chosen according to the preliminary earth model  @xcite .",
    "deep inelastic @xmath7-cross - sections are calculated from quantum cromo dynamics ( pqcd ) with structure functions according to cteq5  @xcite and with a logarithmic extension into the small - x region .",
    "the tau decay is simulated using the program tauola  @xcite . in order to simulate neutrino showers suitable to be detected by the pierre auger observatory ,",
    "some important changes and extensions of the code were needed .",
    "for instance , in anis neutrino propagation and tau decay are simulated only inside the earth .",
    "instead , we need to simulate also the propagation through the atmosphere .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to take into account that the auger observatory is positioned on the surface of the earth .",
    "first , the topography of the auger site was implemented .",
    "the description of the relief of the andes mountains was made according to a digital elevation map ( dem ) .",

    "the original anis version uses the concept of the detection volume  @xcite .",
    "this concept is useful for calculating event rates for a given neutrino flux @xmath8 .",
    "the detection volume corresponds to the so called _ active volume _ in which potentially detectable neutrino interactions are simulated . in the original anis",
    "this volume is defined as a cylinder with z - axis parallel to the neutrino direction  @xcite . in our adapted version we kept the general idea of _ active volume _ but with some modifications , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::method ] .",
    "as it can be seen from this figure , the _ active volume _ for a given incoming neutrino with energy @xmath9 is defined by a particular plane @xmath10 and distance @xmath11 .",
    "the plane @xmath10 is the cross - sectional area of the detector volume and it was used as reference plane for the generation of incoming neutrinos .",
    "the area depends on the zenith angle @xmath12 of the incoming neutrino .",
    "the detector was modelled as a cylinder with radius @xmath13 and height @xmath14 , the distance @xmath11 is the multiple , @xmath15 , of the average lepton range @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "inside the _ active volume _",
    "lepton tracks are also shown .",
    "neutrinos with energy @xmath9 produce leptons with individual ranges , depending on the fraction of energy transfered .",
    "more precisely , the incoming neutrino is forced to interact in the _ active volume _ according to its interaction probability @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total neutrino cross section , @xmath19 the local medium density and @xmath20 the avogadro constant .",
    "@xmath21 is the probability that a neutrino with energy @xmath9 crossing the distance @xmath11 would produce a lepton with an energy @xmath22 . in this way",
    "the production vertex of the lepton is created .",
    "then , the lepton propagates through the matter , losses some energy and decays ( if it s unstable ) in the vicinity of the detector or inside the detector volume . in order to calculate physical quantities",
    ", one has to weight the events .",
    "a first weight is the interaction probability defined by eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "a second weight comes from the normalisation of the injected neutrino flux @xmath8 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the space angle , @xmath25 the observation time and @xmath26 is the number of generated events from surface @xmath10 . here",
    ", we assume the isotropic neutrino flux @xmath27 .",
    "the expected event rate of the neutrinos in the detector volume can be calculated from @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of events triggering the detector and passing all quality cuts of the cascade analysis .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath30 is chosen such that the rate of the neutrinos results in the total number of events per year .",
    "third , new tau lepton decay channels were implemented . in the original anis code",
    "the tau lepton decay is simulated using the code of tauola  @xcite .",
    "the tau lepton decay is simulated by randomly choosing one event from a data base of pre - simulated events .",
    "tau lepton range @xmath31 and its decay length @xmath32 as a function of the energy.,width=8,height=188 ]    finally , the tau lepton decay routine was partly rewritten to take into account the processes of tauons escaping from the earth s surface and decaying in the atmosphere . in anis",
    "the tau is propagated in small energy steps until the age of the tau lepton exceeds the tau lepton lifetime .",
    "this procedure works quite well if the production and decay vertex are in the same medium ( either in air or rock ) , but if the tau lepton crosses the earth s surfaces during its propagation inside the _ active volume _ , different amount of energy loss in the earth s crust and air have to be taken into account . in particular ,",
    "when a tau lepton is generated in the earth , it loses energy due to ionisation and radiation processes .",
    "these energy losses per unit length of crossed matter ( in g/@xmath33 ) are usually approximated by a linear equation ( continuous energy loss approach ) , which reads as @xmath34 where the factor @xmath35 is due to the ionisation losses and @xmath36 is due to radiation losses .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is negligible for ultra - high energies .",
    "the factor @xmath36 parameterises the tau lepton energy loss through bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear interaction .",
    "exemplary we have used two parameterisations : @xmath36 is linear dependent on energy @xmath37 used by aramo et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath38 from  @xcite .",
    "the lepton range , @xmath31 , is given by the integral of the inverse of the tau lepton loss rate over the tau lepton energy @xmath39 thus differences in @xmath36 will lead to different tau lepton ranges ( length of the lepton track ) and consequently influence the expected neutrino event rate and aperture calculations .     during a single step the distance passed by the tau lepton",
    "is evaluated according to the following formula @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the initial energy of the tau lepton and @xmath42 is the energy of the tau lepton after the distance @xmath43 . during the energy step",
    "@xmath36 is constant .",
    "the distance @xmath43 is evaluated with the altitude dependent density @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the density of the earth according to the preliminary earth model  @xcite and @xmath47 is the air density calculated according to the us standard atmosphere ( linsley parameterisation )  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::taurange ] the tau lepton range in standard rock , @xmath48{g / cm^{3}}$ ] is shown for the parameter set @xmath49 based on calculations reported in  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the tau lepton range @xmath31 is of the order of about at .",
    "this value is about 5 times smaller than the tau lepton decay length , @xmath32 , at the same energy .",
    "the decay length is given by @xmath50{km } \\times ( e_{\\tau}/\\unit[10^{18}]{ev})$ ] for tau lepton , where @xmath51 is the tau lepton lifetime in @xmath52 and @xmath53{mev}$ ] is the tau lepton mass  @xcite .",
    "thus , a tau lepton with an energy of about @xmath54{eev}$ ] produced close to the earth s surface can escape from the earth before decaying .",
    "one can note also , that the tau lepton decay length is about for a tau lepton energy of about .",
    "therefore an emerging tau lepton can escape from the atmosphere , which is assumed to have an height of .    applying the neutrino generation code",
    ", we obtain the tau lepton decay vertex position , the energy and momentum of the decay products for simulated neutrino showers with a given energy .",
    "aires was used to generate the longitudinal profiles of charged particles and the energy deposit based on the anis output .",
    "a special mode was used to inject simultaneously several particles at a given interaction point .",
    "the emission of fluorescence light by the shower together with its propagation towards the detector and the response of detector itself , including electronics and trigger , were simulated by the offline software .",
    "finally on the basis of the algorithms implemented in the offline software the first two trigger levels called first level trigger ( flt ) and second level trigger ( slt ) were simulated  @xcite . after the simulated events had passed the flt threshold trigger ( at least one pixel ) , a search for pattern consisting of 5 pixels",
    "was performed according to the slt algorithm . in this way the trigger efficiency of the fd for a given neutrino energy can be defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the the number of aires tau showers simulated for a given neutrino energy , @xmath57 the number of showers passing the slt condition and @xmath58 the duty cycle of fluorescence detector .",

    "significant directional differences in the number of expected events are seen .",

    "however , some peaks in the rate distribution exist for azimuth of about 350@xmath65 ( east ) .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that the auger site is surrounded by the andes on the west and smaller but closer mountains in the east ( see the map shown in fig .",

    "a tool to simulate neutrino propagation and interaction in the earth and in the atmosphere taking into account the local topographic conditions , was presented . a detailed investigation of neutrino induced showers was performed .",
