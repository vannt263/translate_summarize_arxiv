    "massive color - octet vector bosons are predicted in a variety of models , including axigluon models @xcite , topcolor models @xcite , technicolor models with colored technifermions @xcite , flavor - universal @xcite and chiral @xcite coloron models , and extra - dimensional models with kk gluons @xcite .",
    "these states have also recently been considered as a potential source @xcite of the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry observed by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "recent searches for resonances in the dijet mass spectrum at the lhc imply that the lower bound on such a boson is now 2 - 3 tev @xcite .",
    "if there are color - octet vector bosons associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , as suggested by several of the models discussed above , their presence should be uncovered by the lhc in the future .    in this paper , we report the first complete calculation of qcd corrections to the production of a massive color - octet vector boson .",
    "we will refer to these massive color - octet vector states generically as  colorons . \"",
    "we treat the coloron as an asymptotic state in our calculations , employing the narrow width approximation .",
    "our next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation includes both virtual corrections as well as corrections arising from the emission of gluons and light quarks , and we demonstrate the reduction in factorization - scale dependence relative to the leading - order ( lo ) approximation used in previous hadron collider studies .",
    "the qcd nlo calculation of coloron production reported here differs substantially from the classic computation of the qcd nlo corrections to drell - yan production @xcite , because the final state is colored . in particular",
    ", drell - yan production involves the coupling of the light quarks to a conserved ( or , in the case of @xmath2- or @xmath3-mediated processes , conserved up to quark masses ) current .",
    "hence , in computing the nlo corrections to drell - yan processes , the current conservation ward identity insures a cancellation between the uv divergences arising from virtual quark wave function and vertex corrections .",
    "these cancellations do not occur in the calculation of the nlo corrections to coloron production , because of vertex corrections involving the 3-point non - abelian colored - boson vertices . as we describe in section [ sec : virual ] , we use the  pinch technique \" @xcite to divide the problematic non - abelian vertex corrections into two pieces  a  pinched \" piece whose uv divergence contributes to the renormalization of the coloron wavefunction ( and , ultimately , a renormalization of the coloron coupling ) and an  unpinched \" part whose uv divergence ( when combined with an abelian vertex correction ) cancels against the uv divergences in quark wavefunction renormalization .",
    "as we show , once the uv divergences are properly accounted for , the ir divergences cancel in the usual way : the ir divergences arising from real quark or gluon emission cancel against the ir divergences in the virtual corrections , and the ir divergences arising from collinear quarks or gluons in the initial state are absorbed in the properly defined parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we compute the gauge- , quark- , and self - couplings of the coloron from a theory with an extended @xmath4 gauge structure , where @xmath5 is identified with qcd .",
    "the calculation yields the minimal coupling of gluons to colorons , and allows for the most general couplings of quarks to colorons .",
    "the cancellation of uv divergences described above , however , occurs only when the 3-coloron coupling has the strength that arises from the dimension - four gauge - kinetic energy terms of the extended @xmath6 gauge structure .",
    "our computation applies directly to any theory with this structure , _",
    "i.e. _ to massive color - octet vector bosons in axigluon , topcolor , and coloron models . in general , the triple coupling of kk gluons in extra - dimensional models , or of colored technivector mesons in technicolor models , will not follow this pattern .",
    "however our results apply approximately to these cases as well , to the extent that the @xmath6 model is a good low - energy effective theory for the extra dimensional model ( a  two - site \" approximation in the language of deconstruction @xcite ) or for the technicolor theory ( a hidden local symmetry approximation for the effective technivector meson sector @xcite ) . by adding @xmath7 terms in the of effective chiral lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) , and deviations in these couplings are therefore of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cutoff of the effective coloron theory .",
    "the 3- and 4-point self - couplings , however , are neither relevant to the leading - order @xmath10 nor to the ir divergent nlo coloron production contributions , and therefore numerically insignificant . ]",
