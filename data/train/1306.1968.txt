    "the imminent shortage of fossil resources has sparked an intense search for alternative energy sources in the last decades , and hydrogen has been considered as a promising candidate due to its clean reaction with oxygen . however , engineering suitable solid hydrogen storage media with high energy density and appropriate hydrogenation / dehydrogenation properties has proven to be a challenging task . aside from simple metal hydrides like mgh@xmath4 , lih@xmath4 or lialh@xmath0 ,",
    "other materials have been recently proposed with increasing complexity .",
    "the successful synthesis of double - cation borohydrides such as li / k , @xcite li / ca , @xcite li / sc , @xcite k / sc , @xcite na / al , @xcite k / mn and k / mg , @xcite k / y , @xcite li / zn , na / zn , and k / zn @xcite borohydrides has drawn much attention as potential candidates for hydrogen - storage .",
    "@xcite    nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 , a double - cation borohydride of sodium and scandium which contains @xmath5 wt.% hydrogen , was recently synthesized @xcite by ball milling of nabh@xmath0 and sccl@xmath6 @xmath7 below the melting temperature ( @xmath8 410 k ) , nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 was experimentally determined to belong to the @xmath1 crystallographic space group ( no . 63 ) .",
    "@xcite in this phase , nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 is an ionic crystal of which each na@xmath9 cation is octahedrally coordinated to six [ sc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0]@xmath11 complex anions .",
    "the scandium atom of each [ sc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0]@xmath11 complex is surrounded by four [ bh@xmath0 ] tetrahedra , forming a nearly ideal tetrahedron with a sc - b distance between 2.27   and 2.50 . above 410 k , nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 decomposes while releasing hydrogen in two rapid steps between 440  k and 490  k , and between 495  k and 540  k , respectively .",
    "@xcite details on these decomposition steps have not been experimentally determined yet .",
    "@xcite    soon after the experimental synthesis of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 , several theoretical studies were carried out .",
    "@xcite reported that the @xmath1 phase of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 is an insulator with a band gap of @xmath12 ev .",
    "the following single - step decomposition reaction with a release of 9.3 wt.% hydrogen gas was theoretically predicted by kim  @xcite to maximize the gain of landau free energy @xmath13 the pressure @xmath14 at which this hypothetical reaction occurs is related to the temperature @xmath15 through @xcite @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the gibbs free energy change of the reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) at @xmath15 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the gas constant . the entropic contribution from the hydrogen ( gas ) product to @xmath17",
    "is determined by the shomate equation for which the coefficients can be taken from the database of the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) .",
    "@xcite other contributions to @xmath17 can be calculated at the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite level .",
    "kim predicted @xcite that , at @xmath20 bar , the proposed reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) occurs at temperatures between 14 k and 223 k. the wide range of the predicted temperature @xmath15 is due to the dft uncertainty in calculating @xmath17 and comparing with the measured data .",
    "although the temperature calculated for the hypothetical reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) strongly differs from the experimental decomposition temperature ( @xmath21 k ) ,  @xcite relation ( [ eq : vhoff ] ) indicates that at a given temperature @xmath15 , the required h@xmath4 pressure @xmath14 is sensitive to the free energy change @xmath17 since @xmath22 is small ( at the room temperature @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , a change in @xmath14 may be expected for a new low - energy phase of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 even with a small difference in energy with respect to the @xmath1 phase .    in this work",
    "we carefully study the @xmath1 structure of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 with _ ab initio _ calculations , showing that it is dynamically unstable . by following the imaginary frequency phonon modes , a dynamically stable structure with @xmath2 symmetry",
    "is predicted .",
    "furthermore , we report a class of new low - energy structures predicted by the minima - hopping method @xcite ( mhm ) for this material . finally we discuss the influence of small changes in the free energy @xmath17 of these new structures on the hydrogen pressure @xmath14 in reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "we used the projector augmented wave formalism @xcite as implemented in the _ vienna ab initio simulation package _ ( vasp ) @xcite to perform all the dft - based first - principles calculations .",
    "the valence electron configurations of sodium , scandium , boron , and hydrogen were @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the dft total energy @xmath29 was calculated with monkhorst - pack @xmath30-point meshes @xcite with sizes of either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , depending on the volume of the simulation cell , and a plane wave kinetic energy of 450 ev .",
    "the convergence of electronic self - consistent ( sc ) calculations is assumed when the total energy change between two consecutive steps is smaller then @xmath33 ev .",
    "atomic and cell variables were simultaneously relaxed until the residual forces were smaller than @xmath34  ev /  .    for systematically exploring the low - energy landscape corresponding to nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 , we employed the minima - hopping ( mh ) method .",
    "@xcite being needed by the mh algorithm , the total energies @xmath29 , the forces and the stresses of the examined structures are calculated at the dft level by vasp in this work .",
    "they are then used to perform a number of consecutive short molecular dynamics steps , driving the system out of the current minimum at which the system is trapped . at the end of the molecular dynamics stage",
    ", the obtained structure is optimized by ordinary ( local ) geometry relaxations until the convergence criteria described above are met . by choosing the initial velocities of the molecular dynamics trajectories approximately along soft mode directions",
    ", the likelihood of escaping the current minimum and landing at a lower - energy minimum can be significantly improved.@xcite in addition , several build - in feedback mechanisms are implemented , minimizing the possibility of revisiting the already explored minima and enhancing the efficiency of the method.@xcite because the mh method requires no constrain , unknown structural motifs can be explored .",
    "the reliability of this method was shown in many applications that were recently reported .",
    "@xcite    the super - cell approach implemented in phonopy @xcite was used to analyze the phonon frequency spectrum and investigate the dynamical stability of the structures examined . in this approach , the phonon frequencies were calculated from the dynamical matrix of which the force constants were evaluated in vasp .",
    "sufficiently high convergent criteria are required for these force calculations .",
    "in particular , the electronic sc loops are terminated when two consecutive steps differ by less than @xmath35 ev in energy while the residual forces on the atoms have to be smaller than @xmath36  ev /  .",
    "the longitudinal optical / transverse optical ( lo / to ) splitting was not taken into account because its effects on dynamical properties were reported to be negligible for a wide variety of hydrides .",
    "it is well established that the lack of long - range van der waals ( vdw ) interactions in dft , in many cases , may significantly affect its accuracy when investigating soft matter and molecular crystals .",
    "studying magnesium borohydride mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath4 , bil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that dft calculations with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional artificially favors structures with unusually low densities .",
    "@xcite the reason for this observation can probably be traced back to the exceptionally complicated experimental structure of mg(bh@xmath0)@xmath4 which has 330 atoms per cell and is composed of several _ neutral _ sub - structures ( frameworks ) held together by dispersion interactions .",
    "@xcite because conventional dft calculations do not well capture these interactions , a non - local density functional such as vdw - df @xcite was suggested @xcite to be more suitable .",
    "similarly , the experimental structures of some double - cation borohydrides studied in ref .",
    ", e.g. , lizn@xmath4(bh@xmath0)@xmath37 , nazn(bh@xmath0)@xmath6 , and nazn@xmath4(bh@xmath0)@xmath37 , are composed of two neutral , inter - penetrated frameworks.@xcite for these materials , pbe calculations predict very low - density structures to be thermodynamically stable while , at the same time , produce large deviations when optimizing their complicated experimental structures .",
    "@xcite by taking into account the vdw interactions via the non - local density functional vdw - df2 , @xcite the optimized geometries agree better with the experimental data .",
    "it is worth noting that for the borohydrides with simple ionic crystalline structures , e.g. , libh@xmath0 , nabh@xmath0 , and kbh@xmath0 , the calculated results with vdw - df2 are not always better than those with pbe , @xcite indicating that , presumably , the dispersion interactions play a minor role in the crystalline materials dominated by ionic and covalent bonds .",
    "clearly , the performance of a vdw treatment , e.g. , vdw - df2 , is material - dependent , i.e. , it depends on the nature of the interactions in the materials examined .",

    "[ fig : coordination ] and [ fig : structure ] , the na - sc frameworks of the new structures and the @xmath2 structure are completely different . in the novel structural motif ,",
    "each na ( sc ) atom is coordinated to four sc ( na ) atoms at a distance of @xmath38 .",
    "all four - fold coordinated atoms are arranged at the corners of either a rectangle with nearly equal sides or a tetrahedron , leading to two types of na - sc  bonds \" , either arranged on the planes of the rectangles mentioned above or interlinking them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coordination ] ) .",
    "the na - sc planes are stacked in parallel planes and separated by a distance of @xmath39 .",
    "viewed along these na - sc planes , the new structural motif is characterized by hexagons which have two parallel sides placed on the planes .",
    "the lengths of these parallel sides are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 structures ( here , @xmath46   is the na - sc separation in the direction perpendicular to the line of view  see fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) . for the @xmath47 structure ,",
    "this length is infinite since it is composed solely of the parallel na - sc planes .",
    "a comparison of the xrd patterns of the new structures with both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 phases clearly shows that the structures are distinct .",
    "all new structures are dynamically stable with no imaginary phonons in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the structural data , the phonon density of states and the simulated xrd patterns of the examined structures are given in the supplemental materials .",
    "@xcite    we examine the stability of the predicted structures at finite temperatures by computing their helmholtz free energies at the pbe level . in our calculations , vibrational free energies were determined within the harmonic approximation calculated from the phonon frequency spectrum .",
    "[ fig : free_energy ] indicates that up to the melting temperature of ( @xmath8 410k ) , the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are energetically favorable over the @xmath2 structure .",
    "the @xmath47 structure , on the other hand , is thermodynamically less stable than the @xmath2 structure .",
    "the formation of the predicted structures , which are energetically competing with the experimental @xmath2 phase , may be possible . according to the ostwald s step rule in crystal nucleation , @xcite instead of forming the most stable phase directly from a solution , the system crystallizes in a step process where it transforms from less stable phases to phases of higher stability .",
    "in particular , the phase transformation would first occur towards a phase that requires the least activation energy .",
    "overall , nucleation and crystallization are complex processes that often depend on the synthesization method",
    ". therefore , there are chances for the predicted structures exist , given that the suitable synthesization method conditions are chosen .",
    "we then examine the electronic structures of the predicted phases of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 by performing @xmath48 calculations .",
    "@xcite the calculated energy band gaps @xmath49 are shown in table [ table_energy ] .",
    "we found that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 structures have band gaps of @xmath50 ev and @xmath51 ev , respectively . by referring to the result by huang _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath48 correction for these structures is roughly 3.0 ev . similar values for the @xmath48 band gaps were also found for the predicted phases .",
    "several changes in the thermodynamic properties associated with the predicted low - energy structures of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 can be qualitatively estimated . at the room temperature",
    "@xmath52 k , the reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) was predicted @xcite to occurs at the hydrogen pressure @xmath14 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 bar . as the minimum hydrogen pressure @xmath55 bar was predicted for the @xmath1 phase ,",
    "this parameter can be estimated for other low - energy structures of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 assuming that there is no change in the products of the reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "hence , the change of the gibbs energy @xmath17 is given by the change in the helmholtz free energies , calculated at the pbe level and shown in table [ table_energy ] . from @xmath56 , predicted for the @xmath1 phase by using the relation [ eq : vhoff ] , one arrives at @xmath57 bar for the @xmath2 phase .",
    "corresponding to the @xmath43 phase , the @xmath56 can be reached at @xmath58 bar which is only half as much as the required pressure for the @xmath1 phase . estimated @xmath56 of other structures",
    "are also given in table [ table_energy ] .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , it was also predicted @xcite that at @xmath20 bar , the proposed reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) occurs at temperatures between 14 k and 223 k if nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 is in the @xmath1 phase . for the newly proposed phases ,",
    "these temperatures are expected to change .",
    "although a quantitative determination requires @xmath17 to be fully computed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomp ] ) , one can qualitatively find from the vant hoff plots reported @xcite that the temperature changes would be positive , i.e. , the corresponding reaction temperatures are higher than those predicted for the @xmath1 phase , i.e. , somewhat closer to the experimentally determined temperature ( @xmath59k ) .",
    "in summary , we show that the experimentally reported @xmath1 structure of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 is dynamically unstable based on first - principles calculations . by exploring the unstable phonon modes",
    ", we predict a dynamically stable @xmath2 structure which is lower in energy than the @xmath1 structure by 3.8 kj mol@xmath60f.u.@xmath60 but explains the experimental xrd pattern equally well .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2 structure , we report a class of four low - energy structures predicted by the mhm for nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 . these structures exhibit a new structural motif where each sodium ( scandium ) atom is coordinated to four scandium ( sodium ) atoms . below the melting point reported for nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 ,",
    "all of these structures are energetically competing with the experimental @xmath2 phase . according to the empirical ostwald s step rule ,",
    "the formation of the predicted structures may be possible .",
    "once realized , the energy differences of these new structures may significantly influence the hydrogen pressure at which the dehydrogenation reaction ( [ eq : decomp ] ) of nasc(bh@xmath0)@xmath0 occurs .",
