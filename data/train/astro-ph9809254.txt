    "young stars are characterized by a large degree of activity .",
    "winds , jets and outflows are manifestations of the interaction of the stars with the circumstellar environment in which they are embedded .",
    "similarly , both t tauri and herbig ae / be stars show photometric and spectroscopic variability on time scales of minutes to years , indicating that photospheric activity begins in the earliest phases of stellar evolution , prior to the arrival on the main sequence ( ms ) . in many cases ,",
    "strong and rapid line variability has been detected with periods close to the star rotation period , interpreted as due to the rotational modulation of spots on the stellar surface or of fast and slow streams in the stellar wind ( e.g. gahm et al .",
    "1995 ; catala et al .",
    "1989 ) . on the other hand , the fact that young stars during their evolution to the ms move across the instability region of post - ms stars raises the possibility that at least part of the activity could also be due to stellar pulsations ( see baade & stahl 1989 ; kurtz & marang 1995 )",
    "however , the instability properties of young stars have not been studied so far and it is not at all clear whether a pre  main - sequence star can indeed pulsate .",
    "as recently discussed by gautschy & saio ( 1996 ) , stars over essentially the whole mass spectrum can become pulsationally unstable during various stages of their evolution .",
    "in particular , @xmath3 scuti stars are intermediate - mass variables of spectral type a to f with pulsation periods less than @xmath4 and light amplitudes ranging from thousandths of magnitude to some tenths ( breger 1979 ; breger & pamyatnykh 1998 ) . in spite of the traditional association of @xmath3 scuti pulsation with stars in their core hydrogen - burning phase or evolving towards the base of the giant branch and burning hydrogen in a shell , some @xmath3 scuti have been identified to be pms objects ( breger 1972 , kurtz & marang 1995 ) .",
    "kurtz & marang ( 1995 ) have observed the herbig ae star hr  5999 searching for pulsational photometric light variations characteristic of @xmath3 scuti stars .",
    "they have found a peak - to - peak pulsation amplitude of about @xmath5 in johnson v - band and a period of 4.99  hr , superimposed on a nonperiodic photometric variation of @xmath6 probably due to variations of dust obscuration in the circumstellar envelope and disk .",
    "there are other stars in which evidence for pulsational variability has been advocated to explain the observed rapid line profile variability ( e.g. hd  163296 and hd  250550 , baade & stahl 1989 ) , but the case is not as convincing as that provided by hr  5999 . in any case , the discovery of pulsation in pms stars is extremely important since it provides a unique means for constraining the internal structure of young stars and for testing evolutionary models .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the pulsational behavior of stellar models distributed along the evolutionary tracks of pms stars computed by palla & stahler ( 1993 ) .",
    "we identify the boundaries of the instability strip by using nonlinear models .",
    "we can then use these models to constrain the fundamental stellar parameters of hr  5999 and to select a sample of known pms stars that are likely candidates for showing pulsation variability in their photometric light curves .",
    "the calculation of the pulsational instability requires the specification of the stellar parameters , luminosity and effective temperature , for a given mass . we have used the pms models for low- and intermediate - mass stars computed starting at the birthline determined by the protostellar accretion phase ( palla & stahler 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "the development of protostar theory has altered the concept of pms evolution particularly for stars more massive than solar . in comparison with classical evolutionary tracks that used arbitrary initial conditions ,",
    "those of palla & stahler ( 1993 ) occupy a much reduced portion of the hr diagram as a consequence of the modest stellar radii attained by each star during the accretion period .",
    "in addition , stars between 2 and 4 m@xmath0 are not initially convective from surface cooling , but begin their evolution in a thermally unrelaxed state corresponding to luminosities and effective temperatures lower than those of classical evolutionary tracks .",
    "this sequence of events may have direct effects on the study of the instability properties of pms stars and should be taken into account in the selection of the equilibrium models .    as an illustration of the differences in the internal structure of stars at various stages of evolution , fig .",
    "1 shows the variation with radius of the interior density ( normalized to the central value ) for a 3 m@xmath0 star . on the birthline , at the beginning of the pms phase , the density profile is quite flat and the star is thermally unrelaxed . at the end of the relaxation phase , in the middle of the pms track ,",
    "the star has already started its contraction to the zams and is more centrally condensed .",
    "the middle curve of fig .",
    "1 is for a model with luminosity l@xmath7=57  l@xmath0 and effective temperature t@xmath8=6900  k at an age of @xmath9  yr .",
    "as we shall see below , such a model falls within the boundaries of the instability strip . finally , the lower curve is for a star that has completed the main - sequence phase and is evolving toward the red giant branch .",
    "the effective temperature is approximately the same as for the pms star , but the luminosity is now l@xmath7=135  l@xmath0 due to the larger radius ( 8.3 r@xmath0 instead of 5.3 r@xmath0 ) .",
    "these conditions correspond to those of a typical , evolved @xmath3  scuti star .",
    "the star is much more centrally condensed because of the complete exhaustion of hydrogen . however , beyond the inert core , the density profile is quite similar to that of the pms star .",
    "thus , a mature @xmath3  scuti star differs from a young one mostly in the inner regions and for its higher luminosity .",
    "these structural changes clearly affect the estimate of the pulsation periods , as we shall see in the following sections .",
    "the theoretical framework for the investigation of the linear and nonlinear pulsation characteristics has been described in several papers ( e.g. bono et al . 1997 and references therein ) and is briefly summarized here .",
    "we have computed several sequences of linear nonadiabatic models at fixed mass covering a wide range of luminosities and effective temperatures .",
    "these models give information about periods and modal stability and provide the static envelope structures for the nonlinear computations .",
    "we adopt an optical depth of the outermost zone of about 0.001 and fix the inner boundary condition at a fraction of the stellar radius varying between 10 and 20% .",
    "the zone closest to the hydrogen ionization region ( hir ) was constrained to t@xmath10 k and 20 mass zones were inserted between the hir and the surface in order to ensure a good spatial resolution of the outermost regions throughout the pulsation cycle .    due to the key role played by spatial resolution for firmly estimating",
    "both linear and nonlinear modal stability of higher modes , the envelopes were discretized by adopting a detailed zoning in mass .",
    "the mass ratio between consecutive zones ( @xmath11 ) has been assumed equal to @xmath11=1.1 for temperatures lower than @xmath12 k and to @xmath11=1.2 for higher temperatures . in this way",
    "a typical envelope model , used for both linear and nonlinear computations , is characterized by roughly 20 - 30% of the total stellar mass and by 150 - 250 zones .    to model the physical mechanisms which govern the pulsation phenomenon , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 mechanisms in the hydrogen and helium ionization regions ( see cox 1980 )",
    ", we have adopted the opal radiative opacities provided by rogers & iglesias ( 1992 ) for temperatures higher than @xmath15  k and the molecular opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for lower temperatures . a solar chemical composition ( y=0.28 , z=0.02 )",
    "is assumed in all the computations .",
    "for each selected pulsation mode , the fundamental observables that can be derived from the linear nonadiabatic computations are periods and growth rates . in this work",
    ", we limited the study to the first three radial modes of pulsation . a detailed analysis of the sign of growth rates provides an estimate of the location of the blue boundaries of the instability strips for each mode , representing the maximum effective temperatures allowing pulsation at a given luminosity level .",
    "no information is derived about the location of red boundaries because our linear models are completely radiative while the quenching of pulsation at lower effective temperatures is due to the interaction between convective and dynamical motions ( e.g. baker & kippenhan 1965 ) .",
    "although our goal is the definition of the theoretical instability strip , we have specialized the linear analysis to the case of hr  5999 . in particular , we begin by reproducing its observed pulsation period of 4.99 hr for a combination of mass , luminosity and effective temperature consistent with both observations and evolutionary tracks . to this purpose ,",
    "we have computed a grid of linear nonadiabatic models of stars with masses equal to 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , and 4 m@xmath16 , luminosities in the range 10 to 140 l@xmath16 , and effective temperatures 4500@xmath17t@xmath189500  k. the linear pulsation code assumes that the stellar models are in complete thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "figure  2 shows the location in the hr diagram of the lines of constant period ( @xmath19 hr ) for the three pulsation modes and for different stellar masses . at a given mass",
    ", each line interesects the corresponding evolutionary track in one point that determines the values of l@xmath7 and t@xmath20 to be used in the nonlinear models .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 is the position of hr  5999 with the observational uncertainties .",
    "the distance to the star based on hipparcos parallaxes is @xmath21  pc which gives a luminosity of 78@xmath22  l@xmath0 ( van den ancker et al .",
    "the spectral classification of hr  5999 is a7iii / ive and estimates of the effective temperature for this spectral type vary between @xmath237600  k and @xmath237000  k ( e.g. van den ancker et al . 1997 ; solano & fernley 1997 ) .",
    "as one can see from fig .  2 , only few equilibrium models with the correct period fall within the hr  5999 box .",
    "in particular , the model with mass m@xmath7=3 m@xmath0 pulsates in the fundamental mode , that with m@xmath7=3.5 m@xmath0 in the first overtone , and that with m@xmath7=4 m@xmath0 in the second overtone .",
    "the selection of these models restricts the choice of acceptable stellar masses for the detailed nonlinear analysis .",
    "given the static envelope structures produced by the linear computations , we have performed the nonlinear stability analysis .",
    "the equations governing both the dynamical and convective structures were integrated in time until the initial perturbations and the nonlinear fluctuations , which result from the superposition of higher order modes , settled down ( for more details see bono , castellani & stellingwerf 1995 ) . because of",
    "the very low growth rates ( between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , an extremely large period number ( exceeding 10,000 ) must be calculated for each model before reaching the stable limit cycle of pulsation ( maximum amplitude ) .",
    "the initial velocity profile was obtained by perturbing the linear radial eigenfunctions with starting surface velocities varying in the range 0.1 to 10 km s@xmath26 .",
    "as found in investigations of post  main - sequence @xmath3 scuti star models ( milligan & carson 1992 ; bono et al . 1997 ) , the modal stability analysis reveals the presence of stable nonlinear limit cycles in the fundamental , first and second overtone as the effective temperature increases . figure 3 shows the location of the theoretical instability strip boundaries in the hr diagram , together with the last static and the first pulsating models found for different masses . the stellar parameters along the strip are listed in table  1 . in agreement with the distribution originally suggested by breger & bregman ( 1975 ) and whith previous theoretical predictions ( bono et al . 1997 ) , we find that second and first overtone pulsators are located at effective temperatures higher than the fundamental ones .",
    "all the models on the red edge are pulsating in the fundamental mode , while those on the blue edge in either of the overtone modes . the _ red _ edge varies between @xmath236500  k and @xmath237100  k , whereas the _ blue _ edge between @xmath237100  @xmath27 and @xmath237500  k. the width of the instability strip is nearly constant and equal to about 650  k. the time spent by each star within the strip is also a constant fraction of the total pms contraction time , typically between 5 and 10% , although in absolute terms it decreases from @xmath2310@xmath28  yr for m@xmath7=1.5 m@xmath0 to 8@xmath2910@xmath30  yr for m@xmath7=4 m@xmath0 .    as shown in fig .  3",
    ", the pms instability strip terminates abruptly at the blue edge of the m@xmath7=4 m@xmath0 evolutionary track .",
    "this results is the consequence of our assumption that pms stars begin their contraction phase at the birthline computed with an accretion rate of @xmath31 m@xmath0 yr@xmath26 .",
    "it has been shown that such birthline reproduces quite well the the distribution of known pms stars in the hr diagram ( palla & stahler 1990 ) .",
    "obviously , the theoretical instability strip extends to luminosities higher than the upper limit found here for pms stars , but it would then be populated only by more evolved objects such as the classical @xmath3 scuti stars .",
    "the models presented in this paper represent the first attempt to derive the boundaries of the instability strip for young stars .",
    "a complete analysis of the predicted light curves and amplitudes and of the sensitivity to the input physics will be given elsewhere ( marconi et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) . however",
    ", we can use these initial results to set constraints on the pulsational properties of known pms objects .",
    "the location of hr  5999 with respect to the instability strip is shown in panel ( b ) of fig .  3 .",
    "we can see that in order to fall within the strip , the effective temperature of hr  5999 should be lower than @xmath237250  k if its mass is 3 m@xmath0 or equal to @xmath237100  k for m@xmath7=4 m@xmath0",
    ". however , if we accept the pulsation period of 4.99 hr found by kurtz & marang ( 1995 ) , then the only acceptable models would be ( see fig .",
    "2 ) a 3 m@xmath0 star pulsating in the fundamental mode , a 3.5 m@xmath0 in the first overtone , or a 4 m@xmath0 star in the second overtone . on the other hand ,",
    "these three models are located at the blue edge of the strip and the nonlinear stability analysis predicts that they should all pulsate in the second overtone mode .",
    "but in this higher mode only the 4 m@xmath0 model oscillates with the correct period of hr  5999 , ruling out the 3 m@xmath0 and 3.5 m@xmath0 stars as acceptable models .",
    "thus , we conclude that the pulsation properties of hr  5999 suggest a mass of 4 m@xmath0 with second overtone pulsation . despite the relatively short time spent by pms stars inside the strip , fig .",
    "3 shows that there is a number of known objects with the right combination of luminosity and temperature to qualify as candidate pulsators .",
    "these include five stars ( v376  cas , cq  tau , lkh@xmath32  208 , hd  142666 and kk  oph ) of the ux orionis class , characterized by large photometric and polarimetric variations attributed to variable extinction by circumstellar dust ( grinin & tambovtseva 1995 ; natta et al . 1997 ) . as in the case of hr  5999",
    ", these stars should show periodic variations of smaller amplitudes in their photometric behavior . also , there are eight herbig ae / be stars of spectral type between a7 and f7 ( hd  35929 , v351  ori , hd  142527 , lkh@xmath32  233 , ty  cra , rcr  a , tcr  a and hd  104237 ) which are located inside or near the instability strip within the uncertainties of the determination of l@xmath7 and t@xmath8 ( berrilli et al .",
    "1992 ; van den ancker et al .",
    "1998 ) . searches for @xmath3 scuti type variability in these stars are now under way .",
