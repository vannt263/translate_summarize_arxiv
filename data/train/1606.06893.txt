    "the compass collaboration reported the observation of a peak around 1420 mev in the @xmath10 final state , with the pion in p - wave .",
    "then , the @xmath2 decays into @xmath3 in s - wave .",
    "this state was observed in the diffractive scattering of 190 gev @xmath11 beam on a proton target @xcite and was claimed as a signal of a new resonance that was named the @xmath12 resonance , since the quantum numbers of the final state correspond to a @xmath13 configuration .",
    "the signal was also observed in the ves experiment @xcite in the channel @xmath14 .",
    "the triangular singularity played an important role describing the @xmath15 and the isospin forbidden @xmath16 decays measured in @xcite and studied theoretically in @xcite .",
    "a reevaluation of the triangular diagrams was done in @xcite providing a natural way to regularize the loops in the @xmath15 decay and giving a good description of the invariant mass distributions for the process .",
    "a search for related singularities in other physical processes has been done in @xcite .",
    "recently a paper @xcite challenged the claim of the compass peak as a signal of a new resonance , providing a natural explanation of it based on the triangular singularity that unavoidably stems from the decay of the @xmath0 resonance into @xmath4 followed by @xmath17 , with the pion emitted and the remaining @xmath18 merging into the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "it was also noted in @xcite that , if the @xmath9 structure arises from the @xmath19 decay mode of the @xmath0 , then the production rates of the @xmath9 in @xmath20 decays are totally determined by the rates for the @xmath0 .    the triangle singularities were studied by landau @xcite and they appear from processes involving a feynman diagram which has a loop with three intermediate particles , when the three of them are placed on shell and the momenta of the particles are collinear .",
    "recently @xcite , the triangle singularities have also been advocated as an explanation for the observed peak in the @xmath21 spectrum in the @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite decays , from where the existence of two pentaquarks states has been claimed ( see recent talks of s. stone at the blois meeting @xcite and t. skwarnicki at the meson conference @xcite on the latter reaction ) .",
    "there is , however , a very important difference between the work of @xcite and those of @xcite , since in the latter works one does not have information on the couplings needed and then one does not have any idea on the strength of the singularity . on the contrary , in the work of @xcite the dynamics",
    "is well known and then a clear prediction of the strength of the singularity can be made .",
    "thus , while the works of @xcite provide a speculation , the one of @xcite is more than that , since , if confirmed independently , then it offers a natural explanation for all the experimental facts observed in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide an independent confirmation of the results and conclusions of @xcite . at the same time",
    "we offer a technically different derivation and we can provide an answer to questions which were left open in @xcite .",
    "an important one was to determine the interference of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 loops , which could not be resolved in @xcite .",
    "here we can do it , since we use the picture in which the @xmath0 is dynamically generated from the @xmath4 and @xmath26 channels @xcite and the theory provides the coupling of the resonance to these channels with a well defined relative sign .",
    "there are also other details concerning the regularization of the loops and their technical evaluation , which , in our case , we do using elements of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "yet , the final results are very similar in what concerns the position , width and relative strength of the peak , giving a boost to the idea raised in @xcite , and providing a natural description of the peak seen in @xcite that , in view of this , can not be accepted as a new resonance , once a conventional explanation for it has been found . on the other hand ,",
    "the findings of the present work offer a remarkable example of how a decay mode of one resonance can peak at @xmath27 mev higher energy than the nominal resonance mass .",
    "we want to evaluate the amplitude for the decay of the @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will consider the @xmath0 as dynamically generated in a two coupled channel problem with building blocks @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    ", the @xmath32 decays to the @xmath31 pair ( diagrams @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) or to @xmath30 ( diagrams @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , followed by the decays of the @xmath5 to @xmath37 and of the @xmath38 to @xmath39 . at this point ,",

    "@xcite , where the relative sign of @xmath30 to @xmath31 could not be fixed .",

    "@xcite are very similar in what concerns the shapes of the distributions and the relative weight of the @xmath140 and @xmath163 decay modes , which comes to give support to the conclusions reached here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossrho ] we can see the shape of the cross section for the @xmath164 reaction as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath163 system .",
    "we can see clearly the shape of the @xmath0 resonance , peaking around @xmath127 mev , and with its standard width .",
    "however , the same process producing @xmath165 , the @xmath166 reaction , has a very different shape , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossf0 ] .",
    "we see a peak around @xmath167 mev as in the compass experiment @xcite , with a width of about @xmath168 mev , as also observed experimentally .",
    "this peak at @xmath131 mev , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is due to the triangular singularity of the diagrams a ) and b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "this occurs when the particles inside the loops are all placed on shell and , on top of it , the momenta are parallel or antiparallel .",
    "we have checked that the singularity occurs around @xmath167 mev , and the momentum of the @xmath5 , coming from the @xmath0 decay at rest , is parallel to the one of the the @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of the width of the @xmath5 in the loop has a smoothing effect on the signal , and this is in line with what was also concluded by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of the @xmath169 reaction .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that our formalism differs technically from the one normally used in the study of the triangular singularities , where the integrations are performed using the feynman parametrization .",

    "the results of the loop functions in eqs . and are rewarding , showing explicitly the different cuts in terms of the explicit variables when pairs of interacting particles are placed on shell .",
    "the two physical cuts in our case correspond to having the @xmath171 decay into @xmath104 with the two particles on shell and the @xmath18 nearly on shell to produce the @xmath2 .",
    "there is one more important result to comment .",
    "so far , the quantum number of the peak at @xmath167 mev correspond to those suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we look at the decay of the @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the peak position and the width also agree with those seen in the experiment .",
    "the last magnitude to compare is the relative strength of @xmath163 and @xmath140 production . comparing figs . [",
    "fig : crossf0 ] and [ fig : crossrho ] , we see that the ratio of the @xmath140 signal to that of @xmath140 at their respective peaks is of the order of @xmath172 , as also found in @xcite , and in good agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the features observed in the experiment @xcite are nicely reproduced by the decay mode of the @xmath52 into @xmath140 , which proceeds via a triangular loop that has a singularity around @xmath167 mev and is responsible for the peak seen at this energy .",
    "we should note that the decay mode @xmath163 does not show any enhancement in the @xmath131 mev energy region , a feature also observed experimentally .",
    "this last feature is relevant .",
    "indeed , one peculiar thing of the triangular singularity is that the peak appears only in the particular reaction studied , the @xmath173 in the present case .",
    "failure to see the peak in other reactions gives extra support to the explanation given here for the experimental peak of @xcite .",
    "we have studied the decay mode of the @xmath52 into @xmath140 and @xmath163 .",
    "the production mode of the @xmath163 pair is obtained from the chiral unitary approach that generates this resonance from the interaction of the coupled channels @xmath174 and @xmath175 , which allows to determine the couplings of the resonance to these channels .",
    "also the @xmath140 production makes use of the chiral unitary approach for the dynamical generation of the @xmath2 from the interaction of the @xmath39 , @xmath176 and @xmath80 channels . in the present case",
    ", the @xmath0 decays to @xmath104 or @xmath175 , the @xmath5 decays to @xmath177 and the @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "after that , the resulting @xmath176 or @xmath39 rescatter to produce the @xmath2 , which decays into the observed @xmath70 channel .",
    "this decay mode is special since the triangle loop develops a triangular singularity around and energy of @xmath131 mev for the original @xmath171 state , which is produced in @xmath8 reactions at high energies .",
    "we have shown that the position of the peak , its width and the relative weight of the @xmath140 production mode relative to the @xmath163 one are all in agreement with the experimental findings . we could show that all these magnitudes appeared without the use of any free parameter extra to those inherent in the chiral unitary approach and , hence , they are absolute predictions of the theory .",
    "having found a natural explanation for a peak based on known facts , our conclusion is that the `` @xmath9 '' peak does not correspond to a new resonance but is just the manifestation of the decay mode of the well known @xmath0 resonance into the @xmath178 mode .    on the other hand",
    ", one should stress that the present finding is rather remarkable , in the sense that it produces a peak for a decay mode of the resonance at an energy about 200 mev higher than the nominal mass of the resonance .",
    "this is quite a unique finding , and it might shed light into other cases seen in the pdg , where masses of the resonances are found rather different depending on the decay mode studied .",

    "<S> the mechanism develops a singularity at a mass of the @xmath0 around 1420 mev , producing a peak in the cross section of the @xmath8 reaction , used to generate the mesonic final state , which provides a natural explanation of all the features observed in the compass experiment , where a peak observed at this energy is tentatively associated to a new resonance called @xmath9 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the triangular singularity studied here gives rise to a remarkable feature , where a peak is seen for a certain decay channel of a resonance at an energy about 200 mev higher than its nominal mass .    </S>"
