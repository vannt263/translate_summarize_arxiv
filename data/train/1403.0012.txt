    "recently , the poisson point process ( ppp ) has been shown to be a tractable and realistic model of cellular networks @xcite . however , the baseline ppp model predicts the coverage probability of the typical user to be less than 60% if the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) is set to 0 db  even if noise is neglected .",
    "this is clearly insufficient to provide reasonable user experiences in the network .    to improve the user experiences , in cellular systems , the importance of inter - cell interference coordination ( icic ) and intra - cell diversity ( icd )",
    "have long been recognized@xcite . yet , so far , most of the ppp - based cellular analyses lack a careful treatment of these two important aspects of the network , partly due to the lack of a well - established approach to deal with the resulting temporal or spectral correlation @xcite .",
    "modeling the cellular network as a homogeneous ppp , this paper explicitly takes into account the temporal / spectral correlation and analyzes the benefits of icic and icd in cellular downlink under idealized assumptions .",
    "consider the case where a user is always served by the bs that provides the strongest signal averaged over small - scale fading but not shadowing .",
    "for icd , we consider the case where the serving bs always transmit to the user in @xmath0 resource blocks ( rbs ) simultaneously and the user always decodes from the rb with the best sir ( selection combining ) . for icic , we assume under @xmath1-bs coordination , the rbs that the user is assigned are silenced at the next @xmath2 strongest bss .",
    "note that both of the schemes create extra load ( reserved rbs ) in the network : icic at the adjacent cells and icd at the serving cell .",
    "therefore , it is important to quantify the benefits of icic and icd in order to design efficient systems . the main contribution of this paper is to provide explicit expressions for the coverage probability with @xmath1-bs coordination and @xmath0-rb selection combining .",
    "notably , we show that , in the high - reliability regime , where the outage probability goes to zero , the coverage gains due to icic and icd are qualitatively different : icd provides _ order _ gain while icic only offers _ linear _ gain .",
    "in contrast , in the high - spectral efficiency regime , where the sir threshold goes to infinity , such order difference does not exist and icic usually offers larger ( linear ) gain than icd in terms of coverage probability .",
    "the techniques presented in this paper have the potential to lead to a better understanding of the performance of more complex cooperation schemes in wireless networks , which inevitably involve temporal or spectral correlation .      generally speaking , inter - cell interference coordination ( icic ) assigns different time / frequency / spatial dimensions to users from different cells and thus reduces the inter - cell interference .",
    "conventional icic schemes are mostly based on the idea of frequency reuse .",
    "the resource allocation under cell - centric icic is designed offline and does not depend on the user deployment",
    ". while such schemes are advantageous due to their simplicity and small signaling overhead , they are clearly suboptimal since the pre - designed frequency reuse pattern can not cope well with the dynamics of user distribution and channel variation .",
    "therefore , there have been significant efforts in facilitating icic schemes , where the interference coordination ( channel assignment ) is based on real user locations and channel conditions and enabled by multi - cell coordination .",
    "different user - centric ( coordination - based ) icic schemes in ofdma - based networks are well summarized in the recent survey papers @xcite .",
    "conventionally , most of the performance analyses of icic are based on network - level simulation , and the hexagonal - grid model is frequently used @xcite . since real cellular deployments are subject to many practical constraints , recently more and more analyses are based on randomly distributed bss , mostly using the ppp as the model .",
    "these stochastic geometry - based models not only provide alternatives to the classic grid models but also come with extra mathematical tractability @xcite . in terms of the treatment of icic ,",
    "the most relevant papers to this one are @xcite , where the authors analyzed partial frequency reuse schemes using independent thinning . the authors in @xcite considered bs coordination based on clusters grouped by tessellations .",
    "different from these papers , this paper focuses on user - centric icic schemes where the spatial correlation of the coordinated cells is explicitly accounted for .",
    "it is worth noting that icic is closely related to multi - cell processing ( mcp ) and coordinated multipoint ( comp ) transmission , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "mcp / comp emphasizes the multi - antenna aspects of the cell coordination , while the form of icic considered in this paper does not take into account the use of mimo ( joint transmission ) techniques and thus is not subject to the considerable signaling and processing overheads of typical mcp / comp schemes , which include symbol - level synchronization and joint precoder design @xcite .",
    "thus it can be considered as a simple form of mcp / comp that is light on overhead .",
    "intra - cell diversity ( icd ) describes the diversity gain achieved by having the serving bs opportunistically assigns users with their best channels . in cellular systems",
    ", diversity exists in space , time , frequency and among users@xcite .",
    "it is well acknowledged that diversity can significantly boost the network coverage . however",
    ", conventional analyses of diversity usually do not include the treatment of interference , _",
    "e.g.,_@xcite .    in order to analytically characterize diversity in wireless networks with interference ,",
    "a careful treatment of interference correlation is necessary , otherwise the results may be misleading . therefore , there have been a few recent efforts in understanding this correlation@xcite .",
    "notably , @xcite shows that in an _ ad hoc _ type network , simple retransmission schemes do not result in diversity gain if interference correlation is considered . analyzing the intra - cell diversity ( icd ) under interference correlation",
    ", this paper shows that a diversity gain _ can _ be obtained in a cellular setting where the receiver is always connected to the strongest bs , in sharp contrast with the conclusion drawn from _ ad hoc _ type networks in @xcite .",

    "sections  [ sec : icic ]  and  [ sec : icd ] derive the coverage probability for the case with icic or icd only , respectively , and provide results on the asymptotic behavior of the coverage probability in the high - reliability as well as high - spectral efficiency regimes .",
    "the case with both icic and icd is analyzed in section  [ sec : icic&icd ] .",
