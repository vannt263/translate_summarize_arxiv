    "to understand how cosmic reionization occurred during the redshift range @xmath9 , it is necessary to identify the responsible sources . due to the steep decrease of the number density of quasars with redshift at @xmath10 @xcite ,",
    "the currently popular viewpoint is that star - forming galaxies played the dominant role in delivering the necessary ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key question is whether the typical output of ionizing photons from @xmath9 galaxies is sufficient .",
    "this requires knowledge of ( i ) the uv radiation emerging from their stellar populations , defined by @xcite in terms of @xmath6 , the number of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons per uv(@xmath11 ) luminosity and ( ii ) the fraction @xmath12  of such lyc photons that can escape scattering within the galaxy and its immediate vicinity .",
    "neither of these important quantities is currently constrained for early galaxies so this is the primary uncertainty in claims that reionization is driven primarily by star - forming galaxies .",
    "the present letter is motivated by finding observational evidence that the ionizing spectrum is harder , and that @xmath6  and @xmath12  both increase with redshift , particularly for low mass , metal - poor systems characteristic of those that likely dominate reionization .",
    "intense nebular emission , e.g. , of [ oiii]@xmath13 , appears to be more common in high redshift galaxies @xcite and this has been interpreted as evidence for a harder ionizing spectrum .",
    "although such emission lines are not directly accessible with ground - based spectrographs beyond @xmath14 , irac photometry can still trace their presence via an excess inferred in the seds .",
    "the most intense [ oiii ]  emitters at @xmath8 located via irac photometry have confirmed ly@xmath4  emission @xcite which suggests they may have already created significant ionized bubbles for which a high value of @xmath12  is necessary @xcite .",
    "since neither @xmath6  nor @xmath12  can not directly be observed beyond @xmath15 , we seek to find and study analogs of the reionization sources at @xmath16 , the highest redshift where direct measures of these quantities are possible .",
    "the inter - dependence of strong [ oiii ]  emission and the leakage of lyc photons was first evaluated in the context of photoionization models by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that large values of the emission line ratio [ oiii]@xmath13@xmath5[oii]@xmath17 may indicate a high value of @xmath12 . furthermore , the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio is sensitive to the ionization parameter @xmath18 , which is , in ionization equilibrium , related to the ionizing photon production rate @xmath19  and the gas density @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 a correlation between [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio and @xmath6  is thus suggested .",
    "recent supports for these conjectures are provided by significant lyc radiation detected in nearby intense [ oiii ]  emitters @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we use the keck near - infrared spectrograph mosfire to compare the physical properties of a representative sample of intense [ oiii]-emitting lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) at @xmath16 with equivalent data for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "our goal is to understand their [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  line ratios in terms of a hard ionizing spectrum .",
    "ultimately we seek to verify that such sources may also have a high @xmath12  and thus represent valuable analogs of the star - forming galaxies responsible for cosmic reionization .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      figure [ fig : o3o2r23 ] compares the results for our mosfire @xmath223.1 sample with other high redshift and local sources in the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio vs. the r23-index plane .",
    "the latter index is a valuable probe of the gas - phase metallicity . for the newly - observed sample ,",
    "we assume no dust correction , an assumption we return to in section [ ssec : reddening ] . in comparing with literature samples , we classify galaxies as laes",
    "if the rest ew(ly@xmath4 ) exceeds @xmath23  ( @xcite ) , whereas for the continuum - selected galaxies at @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , we assume these are dominated by lbgs ( cf .",
    "no obvious agns are included in the literature samples .    since we are interested in the relevance of intense [ oiii ]  emission as a possible indicator of a high @xmath12 we also plot recent galaxies revealing significant lyc emission ; _",
    "ion2 _ at @xmath25 @xcite , five green pea galaxies at @xmath26 @xcite , and two local galaxies @xcite .",
    "firstly , following @xcite , it is clear that our laes have the highest [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio .",
    "a typical lbg at @xmath24 has an [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio of @xmath27 , whereas the laes presented here lie above @xmath28 at the @xmath29 level with some as high as @xmath30 .",
    "some laes may have even higher ratios given we can not always detect [ oii ]  . notably , this lae - lbg difference is seen even within our own sample .    secondly , laes have an [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio higher than lbgs whose r23-indices are comparable . in local galaxies , a higher ionization parameter , @xmath18 , is found in less chemically - enriched galaxies .",
    "this correlation provides an empirical metallicity indicator for systems with strong line ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although high-@xmath31 lbgs appear to follow the same relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , laes lie above this trend indicative of an enhanced ionization parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies have a metallicity of @xmath32 at a r23-index @xmath30 @xcite that is typically found in our lae sample ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio were adopted as a metallicity indicator @xcite , the laes would have metallicities lower than those based on the r23-index and the @xcite method by @xmath33dex .",
    "we now turn to estimating the ionizing photon production efficiency , @xmath6 , for our mosfire sample using recombination lines in our spectra .",
    "this quantity represents the number of lyc photons per uv luminosity @xcite ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the intrinsic uv - continuum luminosity .",
    "the lyc photons production rate is determined by massive young stars and best constrained by the hydrogen recombination lines , in this case h@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt @xcite representation of the @xcite relation between @xmath19  and the h@xmath2  luminosity @xmath36(h@xmath2 ) , as @xmath37      = 1.36\\times 10^{-12}\\,q_{{\\rm h}^{0 } } / 2.86 \\,\\,[{\\rm s}^{-1 } ] .",
    "\\label{eq : lhbeta_nh0 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the conversion assumes no escaping ionizing photons , i.e all are converted into recombination radiation . to recognize this",
    ", we adopt the notation @xmath38 , whose zero subscript indicates that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is zero .",
    "the quantity @xmath6  can be derived by dividing @xmath38  by ( @xmath39 @xmath12 ) .",
    "the uv luminosity is measured from an sed around @xmath40  using the appropriate rest - frame broadband photometry assuming zero reddening .",
    "the sed fitting was done as described in @xcite .",
    "the assumption of zero reddening is important since it clearly affects @xmath6 .",
    "we note @xcite find dust correction decreases @xmath6  for lyc leakers at @xmath220.3 by @xmath41dex .",
    "@xcite report a similar trend for @xmath42 lbgs .",
    "we return to this assumption in section [ ssec : reddening ] .",
    "h@xmath2  is robustly detected in @xmath43 of our @xmath44 galaxies ( @xmath45 laes , @xmath46 lbgs and the agn ) and the derived values of @xmath38  are listed in table [ tbl : properties ] . among the @xmath47 laes whose h@xmath2  is not detected , two have less precise photometry and are removed from the following discussion as their @xmath38  values are less reliable .",
    "figure [ fig : xi_muv ] compares the distribution of @xmath38   as a function of the absolute uv magnitude for the various categories with those for @xmath48 lbgs analysed using a similar approach based on inferred h@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the 3 with upper limits , the h@xmath2-detected laes have an average @xmath38larger than that inferred for @xmath48 lbgs by @xmath49dex .",
    "they support the contention deduced from figure [ fig : o3o2r23 ] that laes typically have a harder ionizing radiation field than lbgs ( also refer to @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is apparent at a fixed uv magnitude suggesting a higher production rate of ionizing photons .",
    "the offset could be even larger if , as suspected from the large [ oiii]@xmath5[oii]ratio , @xmath12  is non - zero ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath12  @xmath50 , @xmath6  becomes larger than @xmath38   by @xmath51dex .",
    "we note that two laes and one agn - lae have @xmath38  consistent with the lbg population .",
    "this might arise from a particularly high @xmath12 , a less significant ly@xmath4  emission ( @xmath52 ) , and/or a more mature stellar population @xcite inferred from sed fitting ( @xmath53myr ) .      in the foregoing analyses ,",
    "we have ignored any corrections for dust reddening in our sample which would otherwise affect the results we present in both figures [ fig : o3o2r23 ] and [ fig : xi_muv ] .",
    "this assumption is supported by two laes in our sample , lae93564 and lae104037 , for which we are fortunate to see multiple balmer lines and where the balmer decrements are consistent with zero reddening , albeit with an uncertainty of @xmath54e(b@xmath55v )  @xmath56 . for the other laes ,",
    "seds based on our multicolor subaru photometry further restrict the range of e(b@xmath55v )  values consistent with zero to within @xmath57 . if we assume a median e(b@xmath55v )  @xmath58 consistent with the seds and assume an smc attenuation law for @xcite s @xmath38  measurements . ]",
    "@xcite , and the same color excess for the stellar and nebular emission , @xmath38  is only decreased by @xmath59dex .",
    "this would not change our conclusion that laes have a harder ionizing radiation field than lbgs .",
    "of course , any residual correction for dust reddening effect has an even smaller effect on the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio ( a decrease of @xmath60dex ) and the r23-index ( an increase of @xmath61dex ) .",
    "we present keck mosfire measurements of the diagnostic nebular emission lines of [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , and h@xmath2drawn from a sample of @xmath44 @xmath62 and @xmath63 laes and lbgs . in comparison with similar measurements of other surveys ,",
    "we demonstrate that laes have much larger [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  line ratios than those seen in lbgs .",
    "this enhancement can not be fully explained by their low metallicities , given the locally defined relation between metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this difference - ( i ) a larger gas density , ( ii ) a higher production rate of ionizing photons ( and thus a larger mean @xmath6 ) , and ( iii ) a different geometry of hii  clouds ( which relates to a higher @xmath12 ) . for ( i)-(ii )",
    ", following equation ( [ eq : qion ] ) , a dense ism or a high production of ionizing photons will increase the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio .",
    "we believe a denser ism is an unlikely explanation because gas densities estimated from the resolved [ oii]@xmath64 doublet line ratio for laes are , on average , comparable to typical values for @xmath65 continuum - selected galaxies ( @xmath66@xmath67 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although only two of our laes have a well - measured [ oii ]  doublet ratio , both indicate a modest gas density of @xmath68@xmath69@xmath67",
    ".    a higher production rate of ionizing photons is a more natural explanation for the high [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio as we have directly verified they have a high @xmath38",
    ". however , the @xmath70dex larger @xmath19  observed would only increase the ionization parameter @xmath71 by @xmath72dex and the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio by @xmath73dex at a fixed metallicity of @xmath32 ( i.e. , r23 @xmath74 ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the ionizing spectrum may be harder .",
    "in this case we also expect an enhancement in the r23-index .",
    "we can calculate the magnitude of this effect using photoionization models similar to those presented in @xcite , varying the stellar metallicity to represent a change in the hardness of the radiation field ( cf .",
    "we assume a gas phase metallicity of @xmath75 and an ionization parameter of log@xmath18  @xmath76 @xcite . to simulate the effect of a harder spectrum ,",
    "we compare two stellar metallicity cases : @xmath77 comparable to the gas - phase metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a low value of @xmath78 . with these assumptions ,",
    "our photoionization models predict both the [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio and r23-index increase in the low metallicity case by only @xmath79dex , with @xmath6  enhanced by @xmath80dex .",
    "this change is illustrated in figure [ fig : o3o2r23 ] with a black arrow .",
    "this change of @xmath6  originates from the reduced uv - continuum since we fix the ionization parameter . if , conversely , the uv - continuum level is fixed , the higher @xmath6  would further increase the ionization parameter by @xmath81dex and [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio only by @xmath82dex .",
    "neither is sufficient to explain the high [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio .",
    "the third explanation would indicate a strong connection between the large [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio and the escape fraction @xmath12  ( @xcite ) .",
    "if hii  regions are density - bounded , the nebulae have a low column density of hi  and a high @xmath12 .",
    "the large [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio arises since the outer zone that produces [ oii ]  is reduced while the inner [ oiii]-producing zone is unchanged ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the r23-index is largely unaffected since hydrogen will be ionized throughout the nebula . for the ism properties of a lbg",
    ", our photoionization models predict an [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratio enhanced by @xmath83dex with an unchanged r23-index ( @xmath84dex decrease ) for @xmath12  of @xmath85% .",
    "this explanation is compatible with the modest densities observed in the laes , since the [ oii ]  doublet probes the ionized gas density while density - bounded nebulae only affect the hi  density .",
    "the only way to test whether such density - bounded hii  regions are dominant in high-@xmath31 laes and that this provides a contribution to the large [ oiii]@xmath5[oii ]  ratios , is to directly constrain the lyc leakage from @xmath223 laes .",
    "this would permit us to break the degeneracies in the discussion above .",
    "the prospects appear promising given the similarity in line emission properties with the sources recently observed successfully with lyc photons ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the above degeneracy , our sample of @xmath86 laes represent valuable low redshift analogs of the @xmath8 sources with similarly intense [ oiii ]  emission and harder ionizing spectra @xcite that may have the necessary high @xmath12  to drive cosmic reionization .",
