    "when an electronic system is placed in an external magnetic field , motion of electrons perpendicular to the field direction is confined to cyclotron orbits .",
    "the electronic energies are quantized in the form of a discrete set of landau levels ( ll s ) separated by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cyclotron frequency . in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures , ll quantization leads to unusual behavior in many - body systems .",
    "perhaps the most vivid example of such behavior is the fractional quantum hall effect in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi system subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "there has also been much interest lately in the influence of ll quantization on properties of superconductors in a magnetic field .",
    "it was shown by teanovi et.al .",
    "@xcite , that standard abrikosov - gorkov theory of type - ii superconductors which neglects ll quantization , necessarily breaks down at high fields and low temperatures .",
    "the inclusion of ll s in the bcs description of the superconducting instability leads to reentrant behavior at high fields ( much larger than the semi - classical upper critical field @xmath4 ) where the superconductivity is enhanced by a magnetic field @xcite . as a consequence of the underlying ll structure , @xmath4 , or rather @xmath5 , develops oscillations near @xmath6 .",
    "similar types of quantum oscillations , with the same origin , have been predicted in various other measurable quantities which are particularly pronounced in 2d systems @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical question in this context is the nature of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum at high magnetic fields .",
    "it is well known that the existence ( or , typically , absence ) of low - energy excitations in the superconducting state shapes the behavior of all superconducting thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "the problem of quasiparticle excitations has been studied extensively in the low field limit ( @xmath7 ) in the context of an isolated vortex line .",
    "scanning tunneling experiments @xcite have revealed the structure of bound states in the cores of isolated vortices at low fields , thereby confirming an early prediction of localized midgap states by caroli , de gennes and matricon @xcite . only recently ,",
    "was the problem of quasiparticle excitations in high magnetic field in the presence of a vortex lattice addressed by a number of groups @xcite : at high magnetic fields in extreme type - ii superconductors vortices are closely packed ( @xmath8 ) so that the isolated vortex picture from the low - field limit necessarily breaks down . in clean samples at low temperatures quasiparticles",
    "can propagate coherently over many unit cells of the vortex lattice .",
    "the solution of the bcs problem @xcite , where the coherent nature of quasiparticle excitations is fully accounted for , points to the qualitatively new nature of the energy spectrum at high fields : at fields near @xmath9 this spectrum is _ gapless _ at a discrete set of points on the fermi surface .",
    "this gapless behavior in 3d systems persists to a surprisingly low magnetic field @xmath10 @xcite , below which the gaps start opening up , and the system eventually reaches the regime of localized states in the cores of isolated vortices @xcite .",
    "the gapless character of the excitation spectrum leads to algebraic behavior of various thermodynamic functions in the high field / low temperatures portion of the h - t phase diagram @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown by dukan and teanovi @xcite that the recent observations of the dhva - oscillations in the mixed state of a-15 superconductors @xcite follow from the presence of a small portion of the fermi surface containing gapless quasiparticle excitations , surrounded by regions where the bcs gap is large .",
    "this picture has received further support in the dhva experiments on yni@xmath11b@xmath11c @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the influence of the non - magnetic ( scalar ) impurities on the gapless superconducting state in high fields , by examining the behavior of the superconducting density of states ( dos ) in the presence of disorder .",
    "we are interested in a _",
    "dirty _ but _ homogeneous _",
    "superconductor for which the coherence length @xmath12 is much longer then the effective range @xmath13 of the impurity potential . under this condition the order parameter in the mixed state is not substantially affected by the impurities and it is assumed to form a perfect triangular vortex lattice . in the opposite ,",
    "inhomogeneous , limit the impurity potential can pin the vortex making an otherwise perfect vortex lattice disordered .",
    "the problem of the superconducting instability and the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in the presence of randomly distributed vortex lines has been addressed so far only by gedik and teanovi in the quantum limit , where electrons occupy only the lowest ll .",
    "it was demonstrated that the gaplessness of the excitation spectrum found in a pure superconductor is preserved even when the positions of the vortex lines are completely random @xcite .    to understand the effect of disorder on the superconducting properties in the high - field limit near @xmath6 we start with the normal state in this limit .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly investigated in the study of transport properties in high fields @xcite , where it was found that the electronic scattering with scalar point - like impurities randomly distributed through the sample leads to isotropic broadening by @xmath14 of the ( ll s ) , where @xmath15 is the scattering rate due to the disorder . as long as the broadening @xmath16 ,",
    "the discreteness of the ll structure is preserved and the effect of the disorder on the superconducting state can be analyzed pertubatively starting from the results for the pure superconductor in high field .",
    "we present a green s function pertubative approach to impurity effects in this regime based on the theory of superconducting alloys of abrikosov and gorkov @xcite this is a standard field - theory technique of treating the disorder in the superconducting state , and has been used extensively in the study of anisotropic superconductors such as heavy - fermion systems , p- or d - wave unconventional superconductors @xcite or in the study of superfluidity in @xmath17he films @xcite .",

    "when disorder becomes stronger than some critical value , a finite density of states ( but still smaller then the normal state value ) is created at the fermi level . the finite superconducting density of states at the fermi level signals the broadening of gapless points into gapless regions in the mbz .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this behavior is similar to that of dirty superfluid @xmath17he films @xcite , and somewhat similar to the behavior of the density of states in anisotropic heavy - fermion superconductors @xcite .",
    "the experimental property of a superconductor in which the absence of a quasiparticle gap over some region of the fermi surface will be most obviously felt is the specific heat . in a clean system in high magnetic field at low temperatures @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the field dependent coefficient @xcite . in a dirty but homogeneous superconductor , instead of",
    "the @xmath206 law one finds linear behavior at low temperatures with the coefficient reduced by the factor @xmath207 from the normal state value .",
    "detailed measurements of heat capacity at very low temperatures and high magnetic fields are not yet found in the literature .",
    "we propose a class of a-15 superconductors as good candidates in which the linear temperature law of heat capacity at high magnetic field can be discovered .",
    "these systems have experimentally accessible upper critical fields and are clear examples of materials for which the ll quantization in high fields plays an important role @xcite .      99 zlatko teanovi , m. rasolt and li xing , phys . rev . lett . * 63 * , 2425 ( 1989 ) ; zlatko teanovi , m. rasolt and l. xing , phys . rev .",
