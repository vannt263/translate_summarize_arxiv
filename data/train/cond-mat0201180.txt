    "the ising model is one of the most studied systems in the theory of phase transitions , not only because it is the simplest nontrivial model that has a critical behavior with nonclassical exponents , but also because it describes the critical behavior of many physical systems . indeed , many systems characterized by short - range interactions and a scalar order parameter undergo a continuous phase transition belonging to the ising universality class .",
    "we mention the liquid - vapor transition in simple fluids and the critical transitions in multicomponent fluid mixtures , in uniaxial antiferromagnetic materials , and in micellar systems .",
    "continuous transitions belonging to the three - dimensional ising universality class are also expected in high - energy physics , for instance in the electroweak theory at finite temperature and in the theory of strong interactions at finite temperature and finite baryon - number chemical potential .",
    "for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the high - temperature ( ht ) expansion is one of the most efficient approaches to the study of critical phenomena .",
    "very precise results have been obtained by performing careful extrapolations to the critical point , by using several different methods , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . for moderately long series , such as those available for models in the three - dimensional ising universality class , the nonanalytic confluent corrections are the main source of systematic errors",
    "for instance , according to renormalization - group theory , the critical behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is given by the wegner expansion @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reduced temperature and @xmath9 is a noninteger exponent , @xmath10 in the ising case . in the analysis of ht expansions these nonanalytic terms introduce large and dangerously undetectable systematic deviations in the results .    in order to obtain precise estimates of the critical parameters ,",
    "the approximants of the ht series should properly allow for the confluent nonanalytic corrections @xcite .",
    "however , the extensive numerical work that has been done shows that in practice , with the series of moderate length that are available today , no unbiased analysis is able to take effectively into account nonanalytic correction - to - scaling terms . in order to treat them properly , one should use biased methods in which the presence of the leading nonanalytic term with exponent @xmath9 is imposed ( see , e.g. ,  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . an alternative approach to this problem consists in considering models  we call them _",
    "improved_that do not couple the leading irrelevant operator that gives rise to the confluent correction of order @xmath11 . therefore , such correction does not appear in the expansion of _ any _ thermodynamic quantity near the critical point : for instance , @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ chiwexp ] ) . in this case",
    ", we expect standard analysis techniques to be much more effective , since the main source of systematic error should have been eliminated .",
    "there are no methods that allow to determine exactly improved models , and one must therefore use numerical techniques .",
    "one may use ht expansions , but in this case the improved model is determined with a relatively large error @xcite so that the final results do not significantly improve the estimates obtained from standard analyses using biased approximants .",
    "recently , it has been realized that monte carlo ( mc ) simulations using finite - size scaling techniques are very effective for this purpose , obtaining accurate determinations of several improved models in the ising , xy , and o(3 ) universality classes .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , analyses of the ht series for the improved models lead to a significant improvement in the estimates of the critical exponents and of other infinite - volume ht quantities .",
    "our working hypothesis is that , with the series of current length , the systematic errors , i.e. , the systematic deviations that are not taken into account in the analysis , are largely due to the leading confluent correction , so that improved models give results with smaller and , more importantly , reliable error estimates .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked by comparing the results obtained using different improved models : if correct , they should agree within error bars . in the following",
    "we shall report results that confirm our hypothesis .",
    "indeed , the estimates obtained from three different improved hamiltonians are perfectly consistent . moreover",
    ", they are very stable with respect to the order of the series considered in the analysis , without showing dangerous trends , but only an apparent reduction of the error .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using 20th - order series are fully consistent with the 25th - order analysis that we present .",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice and scalar models with hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 indicates nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath16 are real variables , and @xmath17 is a generic potential satisfying appropriate stability constraints .",
    "these models are expected to have either a critical transition belonging to the ising universality class or a first - order transition between a disordered and an ordered phase , apart from special cases that correspond to multicritical points . using the linked - cluster expansion technique ,",
    "we compute , for an arbitrary potential , the ht expansion of the two - point correlation function to 25th order on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "these results extend those of ref .",
    "@xcite that reported the two - point function to 20th order @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider three classes of models depending on an irrelevant parameter , which is fixed by requiring the absence of the leading scaling correction .",
    "the first one is the @xmath18 lattice model with potential @xmath19 mc simulations using finite - size scaling techniques have shown that the model is improved for @xcite @xmath20 a consistent but less precise estimate can be obtained from the ht expansion @xcite . the second class of models is the @xmath21 lattice model with potential @xmath22 fixing @xmath23 , the @xmath21 hamiltonian is improved for @xcite @xmath24 finally , we consider the spin-1 ( or blume - capel ) hamiltonian @xmath25 where the variables @xmath26 take the values @xmath27 .",
    "an improved spin-1 model is obtained for @xcite @xmath28 the comparison of the results obtained using the above - mentioned improved hamiltonians represents a strong check of the expected reduction of systematic errors in the ht results , and provides an estimate of the residual errors due to the subleading confluent corrections to scaling .",
    "we also extend the ht expansion of the zero - momentum @xmath29-point correlation functions @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we compute @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 to 21st , 19th , and 17th order respectively .",
    "the analysis of such series provides information on the small - magnetization expansion of the helmholtz free energy in the ht phase .",
    "these results are used to determine approximate representations of the equation of state that are valid in the critical regime in the whole @xmath34 plane . for this purpose , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use a systematic approximation scheme based on polynomial parametric representations and on a global stationarity condition .",
    "this approach allows us to obtain an accurate determination of the critical equation of state in the whole critical region up to the coexistence curve .    in table",
    "[ summary ] we anticipate most of the results that we shall obtain in this paper .",
    "we report ht estimates of the critical exponents and of the coefficients parametrizing the small - magnetization expansion of the helmholtz free energy : they are denoted by iht , where the  i \" stresses the fact that we are using improved models .",
    "then , we report several amplitude ratios ( definitions are given in sec .",
    "[ univratio ] ) .",
    "those appearing in the column iht - pr are obtained from an approximate representation of the equation of state that uses the ht results as inputs , those labelled by lt are obtained from the analysis of low - temperature expansions , while those reported under iht - pr+lt are obtained combining the iht - pr and lt results .",
    "the comparison with the corresponding table xiii of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the estimates obtained from the 25th - order series are essentially identical to those obtained by using the shorter 20th - order series .",
    "however , the longer series allow us to give error bars that are smaller by a factor of 1.5 - 2 , depending on the observable .",
    "the estimates reported in table  [ summary ] are in substantial agreement with , and substantially more precise than , the best theoretical and experimental results that have been previously obtained . for a comprehensive recent review of theoretical and experimental results ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "we mention the planned experiments in microgravity environment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which may substantially improve the experimental determinations of the critical quantities and make the comparison with the theoretical computations more stringent .",
    "after completion of this work , the study reported in ref .",
    "@xcite appeared , where analyses of 25th - order series for spin-@xmath35 models are reported .",
    "results for the critical exponents are obtained by means of biased analyses , essentially by fixing @xmath9 .",
    "comparing ref .",
    "@xcite with refs .",
    "@xcite , where 21st- and 23rd - order series are analyzed , a trend appears towards better agreement with improved hamiltonian results ( ref .",
    "@xcite and present paper ) .",
    "the latest results of the authors of ref .",
