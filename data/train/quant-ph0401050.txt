    "cooperative effects due to the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms are of great importance in many fields , most recently in the study of possible quantum computers based on trapped ions or atoms , and therefore they have attracted considerable interest in the literature @xcite . a sensitive test for such cooperative effects can be provided by atoms showing macroscopic light and dark periods in their fluorescence .",
    "these can occur in a multilevel system if the electron is essentially shelved in a metastable state , thereby causing the photon emission to cease @xcite .",
    "two or three such systems accordingly show three or four periods of different intensity , namely one dark period and bright periods with once , twice , or three times the intensity of a single system s bright period .",

    "the quantitative explanation of such large cooperative effects for distances of the order of 10 wavelengths of the strong transition has been found difficult @xcite .",
    "experiments with other ions showed no observable cooperative effects @xcite , in particular none were seen for hg@xmath3 for a distance of about 15 wave lengths @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the results for two d systems and two four - level systems are very similar , in particular in their first order term in @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore very likely that the cooperative effects for three four - level systems are also only enhanced by a factor of about 2 , and since the effects for two four - level systems were already negligibly small one can expect a similar behavior also for three of such systems ."
