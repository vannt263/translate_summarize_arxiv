    "in this paper , we develop a more general method for finding uniform approximation using symbol calculus and quantum normal form theory . as an example , we use this more general method to derive a new uniform asymptotic formula for the wigner @xmath0-symbol in terms of wigner rotation matrices . the asymptotic formula itself",
    "was announced without proof in our earlier paper @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will fill in the proof , and leave out the implementation and numerical tests of this new uniform formula , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the traditional method of finding uniform approximations is reviewed in berry and mount @xcite . in the traditional approach for a schrdinger equation in one variable @xmath1 ,",
    "one uses a change of variable @xmath2 to transform the original equation into a solvable one , called a `` comparison equation . ''",
    "one then expresses the asymptotic solution to the original equation in terms of the exact solution of the comparison equation . because the action functions are the phase functions of the wkb formula , and",
    "because the wkb limit of the solution of the original equation and the wkb limit of the uniform formula must match , the requirement for the change of variable @xmath3 is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the action for the original hamiltonian , and @xmath6 is the action for the comparison equation .",
    "these action functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 have geometrical interpretation in terms of phase space areas enclosed by the level sets of the classical hamiltonian and the comparison equation , respectively .",
    "geometrically , the condition @xmath7 requires the existence of a canonical , or area preserving map @xmath8 that sends the level set of the original hamiltonian to level set of the comparison equation .",
    "these special canonical maps , which are induced by coordinate transformations , are called point transformations . in other words , the traditional method of uniform approximation",
    "is based on the existence of point transformations .",
    "the more general approach to uniform approximations developed in this paper is based on the existence of more general canonical transformations .",
    "the main theoretical tool we use is a theory of quantum normal form , which transforms general differential operators into `` normal form '' operators based on the correspondence between canonical transformations and unitary transformations .",
    "this correspondence is developed using symbol calculus in @xcite . in this more general approach ,",
    "we are no longer restricted to point transformations , or even differential equations . since there exist more general symbol correspondence between matrix operators and functions on a sphere",
    ", we can apply the more general theory to matrix equations as well as differential equations . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate this novel possibility by applying this method to derive a uniform approximation for the wigner @xmath0-symbol using the stratonovich - weyl symbol correspondence @xcite between finite dimensional matrix operators and functions on a spherical phase space .",
    "we now give an outline of this paper . in section [ ch5 :",
    "sec_normal_form ] , we review the basic result of quantum normal form theory , and recast the method of comparison equation in the language of a quantum normal forms . in section [ ch5 :",
    "sec_6j_matrix_symbol ] , we find the symbols for the matrix operators that define the wigner @xmath0-symbol , and look at the intersections of their associated level sets on the @xmath9-sphere . in section [ ch5 : sec_determine_beta ] , we choose the rotation matrices to be a normal form for the @xmath0-symbol , and describe the canonical map used to construct the unitary transformation in section [ ch5 : sec_symplectic_map ] .",
    "finally , in section [ ch5 : sec_uniform_formula ] , we derive the uniform approximation for the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "the last section contains conclusions and comments .",
    "quantum normal form theory is based on the @xmath10-expansion of a symbol correspondence , such as the weyl symbol correspondence between operators on the hilbert space @xmath11 and functions on an @xmath12 phase space .",
    "in such an @xmath13-expansion , there is a natural relationship between operator commutators and poisson brackets :    @xmath14 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad      i \\hbar \\{a , \\ , b \\ }   + o ( \\hbar^2 ) \\ , .\\ ] ]    in the above notation , a right arrow indicates the symbol of an operator , and a left arrow indicates the inverse symbol of a function . in general we will denote an operator with a hat on top , and its symbol by the same letter without the hat .    in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_commutator_bracket ] )",
    ", we can take @xmath15 to be a hamiltonian @xmath16 , and take @xmath17 to be a generator for a unitary operator @xmath18 .",
    "then integrating equation ( [ ch5 : eq_commutator_bracket ] ) gives us a relationship between a unitary transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath16 and a canonical transformation of the classical hamiltonian @xmath19 :    @xmath20    here @xmath21 is a new hamiltonian , called a normal form of the original hamiltonian @xmath16 , and @xmath22 is a canonical transformation generated by the generator @xmath23 .",
    "the strategy is to choose @xmath22 so that the normal form @xmath21 is simple and solvable .",
    "this is the main idea behind quantum normal form theory . for more details on the construction of the unitary operator @xmath18 from the canonical transformation @xmath22 , see [ ch5 : section_unitary_operator ] .",
    "we now use the correspondence in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_normal_form_operator ] ) to find the wavefunction @xmath24 of an eigenstate @xmath25 , where the eigenstate satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath26 and where @xmath27 is an eigenvalue of some arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath16 .    the action integral @xmath28 is the area bounded by the level set @xmath29 and the line @xmath30 in the @xmath1-@xmath31 phase plane .",

    "we construct a unitary operator @xmath18 based on this canonical map @xmath22 , and define    @xmath45    from equation ( [ ch5 : eq_normal_form_operator ] ) , the symbols of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by the right hand side of equation ( [ ch5 : eq_z_conditions_1 ] ) and equation ( [ ch5 : eq_z_conditions_2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we have    @xmath48    we now relate the eigenstate @xmath25 of @xmath16 to the eigenstate @xmath49 of @xmath37 through the unitary operator @xmath18 and the non - unitary operator @xmath17 .",
    "first we insert @xmath50 on the left and the identity operator @xmath51 on the right of @xmath52 in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_eigen_h ] ) , we find    @xmath53    we then insert @xmath54 on the left and the identity operator @xmath55 on the right of @xmath52 in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_k_1_transformation ] ) , we find    @xmath56    where we have used an operator identity    @xmath57    this operator identity equation ( [ ch5 : eq_op_identity ] ) follows from a general star product identity that holds to first order in @xmath13 ,    @xmath58    from equation ( [ ch5 : eq_a_u_psi ] ) , we conclude that    @xmath59    inverting the relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath49 in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_n_psi ] ) , we find    @xmath60    an analogous calculation for the operator @xmath61 leads to    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is an eigenstate of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath38 .    taking the scalar product between the states in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_normal_form_psi_ket ] ) and equation ( [ ch5 : eq_normal_form_x_ket ] )",
    ", we get the wavefunction of the eigenstate @xmath64 , @xmath65 where we have used the unitary property to cancel @xmath18 and @xmath66 in the second equality .    as an example , let us use equation ( [ ch5 : eq_general_uniform ] ) to derive the airy type uniform approximation for a general schrdinger equation , which has the following form    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is some general potential function .",
    "we will assume that there exist a canonical map @xmath22 , given by ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , that sends the level set of the symbol of the schrdinger equation , @xmath72 , into the level set of the symbol of the airy equation , @xmath73 .",

    "since we are using a point transformation , the explicit form of the unitary transformation is available .",
    "it is simply given by @xmath79 .",

    "this is the result for the airy type uniform approximation for a general schrdinger equation , so the more general method developed here is consistent with the result from the traditional method of comparison equations .",

    "this is why it was necessary to generalize the theory of uniform approximation to handle more general canonical transformations that are not point transformations in the beginning .",
    "since we are allowed to use general canonical maps in our new approach , we can effectively squeeze or stretch the shaded area in figure [ ch5 : fig_canonical_map ] by tilting circle 2 , @xmath210 , by some angle @xmath211 about the @xmath178 axis , as illustrated on the right of figure [ ch5 : fig_canonical_map ] . the angle @xmath211 , which is a function of @xmath171 ,",

    ", we can evaluate @xmath23 at the point @xmath238 as a limit @xmath239 on the curve @xmath240 ,    @xmath241    where we have used lhoptal rule in the second equality , the chain rule and the fact @xmath242 in the third equality . in the fourth equality",
    ", we have used the fact that @xmath243 and @xmath244 are canonical coordinates , so the derivatives can be replaced by poisson brackets .",
    "similarly , we can evaluate @xmath245 from its definition in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_j_12_j_z_relation ] ) as a limit @xmath246 on the curve @xmath237 ,    @xmath247    it turns out the product of the two derivatives @xmath248 and @xmath249 is equal to the jacobian of the canonical transformation at the intersection point @xmath238 , which is equal to unity by the area preserving property of the map . to see this , note that @xmath250 implies that @xmath251 at @xmath238 .",
    "so the jacobian simplifies as follows :    @xmath252    thus , from equations ( [ ch5 : eq_6j_a_value ] ) , ( [ ch5 : eq_6j_b_value ] ) , and ( [ ch5 : eq_unity_determinant ] ) , we find    @xmath253    putting equation ( [ ch5 : eq_ab_value ] ) back into equation ( [ ch5 : eq_uniform_formula_3 ] ) , we have    @xmath254    using the expression of @xmath181 from equation ( [ ch5 : eq_j_n_def ] ) , we find    @xmath255    where @xmath256 . either through a direct calculation using the expression of @xmath112 from equation ( [ ch5 : eq_j_23_function ] ) , or using equation ( 73 ) from @xcite , we have    latexmath:[\\[\\label{ch5 : eq_j12_j23_bracket }     where @xmath87 is the volume of the tetrahedron formed by the six edge lengths @xmath173",
    ". finally , putting the poisson brackets back into equation ( [ ch5 : eq_uniform_formula_4 ] ) and using the definition of the @xmath0-symbol from equation ( [ ch5 : eq_6j_symbol_def ] ) , we arrive at the uniform approximation of the @xmath0-symbol in terms of the @xmath83-matrices    @xmath258    where we have put back an arbitrary phase @xmath259 that we have been ignoring up to now .",
    "this extra phase is given in equation ( 69 ) and equation ( 75 ) of @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the uniform approximation in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_uniform_formula_5 ] ) is excellent .",
    "it is superior compared to the ponzano regge formula even in the classically allowed regions .",
    "see @xcite for more details on the numerical performance of this uniform approximation .",
    "in this paper , we found that the symbol of the @xmath156 matrix operator is the edge length @xmath112 in a tetrahedron as a function of the opposite edge length @xmath111 and dihedral angle @xmath140 .",
    "this coincidence , though not surprising , has allowed us to use the schlfli identity to derive the ponzano - regge phase for the area of the lune in figure [ ch5 : fig_canonical_map_1 ] .",
    "there is a similar matrix operator @xmath156 for the @xmath260-deformed @xmath0-symbol , and a similar schlfli identity for spherical tetrahedra . if we can show that the symbol of @xmath156 in the @xmath260-deformed @xmath122 basis is the @xmath112 function in a spherical tetrahedron , we can use the method in this paper to give a new derivation for the asymptotic formula of the @xmath260-deformed @xmath0-symbol . we can also derive a new uniform approximation in terms of the rotation matrices .",
    "we shall pursue this avenue of research in a future project .",
    "another application of the method developed in this paper is in generalizing the bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions from schrdinger equations to matrix operators . given that the level sets of the symbol of the eigenvalue equations are mapped to the level sets of the @xmath83-matrices , which contain quantized areas on the sphere , we can derive quantization conditions by quantizing the area enclosed by the level set of the symbol of the original matrix operator .",
    "a recent example of quantization conditions on spherical phase space is the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition @xcite for the volume operator .",
    "although we do not actually need to construct the unitary operator @xmath18 explicitly in our calculation , for completeness , we now give details on the construction of @xmath18 from the canonical map @xmath22 in this appendix .",
    "this discussion will also make it clear that @xmath261 , not @xmath22 , should be used in equation ( [ ch5 : eq_normal_form_operator ] ) .",
    "given a hamiltonian @xmath16 and a desired normal form @xmath262 , we assume there exist a canonical map @xmath22 of the phase space that transforms @xmath263 to @xmath262 , in other words , @xmath264 .",
    "we imbed @xmath22 into a smooth one parameter family of canonical maps @xmath265 , @xmath266 $ ] , with the boundary condition @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "we set the symbol of the generators of the unitary transformation @xmath269 to be the solution of the differential equation    @xmath270    once we have @xmath269 , we use the inverse symbol map to find @xmath271 , and construct @xmath272 as the solution of the operator equation    @xmath273    with boundary condition @xmath274 .",
    "we finally set @xmath275 .    to show that @xmath276 is indeed the principal symbol of @xmath277 .",
    "we will trace the evolution of @xmath278 backwards from @xmath21 to @xmath16 .",
    "suppose @xmath21 is known .",
    "denote the symbol of @xmath21 up to order @xmath13 by @xmath279 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath280 .",
    "define @xmath281 , so that @xmath282 , @xmath283 . differentiate @xmath284 and use equation ( [ dude ] ) to get    @xmath285",
    "\\ , .\\ ] ]    transcribing to symbols using equation ( [ ch5 : eq_commutator_bracket ] ) , keeping terms up to first order in @xmath13 , we find    @xmath286    then @xmath287 is the solution to the above equation , as a result of the following calculation :    @xmath288    where we have used equation ( [ dzde ] ) in the second equality , and the chain rule in the third equality .",
    "thus , we find @xmath289 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath290 at @xmath291 then requires @xmath292 , which is equal to the normal form @xmath262 by our choice of the canonical map @xmath22 .",
    "this shows the symbol of @xmath293 up to order @xmath13 is in the required normal form @xmath262 .",
    "this completes the demonstration of the relationship between unitary transformations of the hamiltonian operator and the canonical transformations of classical hamiltonian functions ."
