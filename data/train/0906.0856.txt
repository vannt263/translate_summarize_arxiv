    ". reliable evaluation of the rates of neutrino - nucleus interactions is necessary for the terrestrial neutrino detectors such as super - kamiokande and sno @xcite , for predicting the amount of elements produced in the nucleosynthesis through neutrino - processes @xcite , and for understanding the mechanism of supernova explosion@xcite after the core bounce of the gravitational collapse of massive stars .    in the neutrino heating mechanism , which is one of the key issues for the successful supernova explosion",
    ", the neutrino - nucleus interactions may contribute to the energy deposition in addition to the neutrino - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "in most of recent studies on supernovae , the shock wave launched by the core bounce stalls on the way and needs extra assistance to revive the outward propagation @xcite . although the absorption of neutrino on the nucleon is the main mechanism of the energy deposition , nucleus can be an extra agent of the energy deposition through the absorption or scattering .",
    "an advantage of nuclei as targets is that neutrinos interact through the neutral - current ( nc ) as well as the charged - current ( cc ) .",
    "since the neutrinos of @xmath5- and @xmath6-types have relatively higher average energies than those of electron - type , they can have larger cross sections than those from the cc reactions for the low - energy electron - type neutrinos .    the neutrino heating through the neutrino - nucleus interactions has been proposed by haxton and the average energy transfer cross section has been evaluated for the representative case of @xmath1he and @xmath7fe @xcite . since the matter from outer layer free - falls down to the shock wave and is dissociated into @xmath1he and nucleons due to the shock heating , those two representative species are potential targets of neutrinos streaming from the central core .",
    "although its influence on the supernova dynamics has been studied by numerical simulations under the spherical symmetry with those reaction rates @xcite , it was reported that their effect is too small to affect significantly the dynamics . in a recent study on the standing accretion shock - wave instability ( sasi ) , ohnishi et al",
    "@xcite have explored how the inelastic scattering of neutrinos with @xmath1he influence the outcome of shock dynamics by performing numerical simulations in two dimensions . an effect on the growth of instability toward the explosion",
    "is found only for the critical condition in which the dynamics of shock wave is marginal to the explosion and exploratory cases with enhanced reaction rates .",
    "the effect depends crucially on the cross section of the neutrino-@xmath1he scattering and detailed evaluation based on theoretical models have been done recently @xcite .    recently , several authors pointed out the appearance of light elements ( a @xmath8 3 ) other than @xmath1he in supernova environment , and its potential role on the supernovae through the neutrino interactions@xcite .",

    "they demonstrated that the neutrino reactions on the light elements can have an influence on the spectra of neutrinos emitted from the surface of proto - neutron stars .",
    "so far , attention has been paid to the neutrino reactions on a=3 , 4 nuclei only .",
    "sumiyoshi and rpke @xcite studied the composition of light elements in supernovae by including the deuteron , a=3 , 4 nuclei and others in many - body calculations ( see also @xcite ) , and found that the deuteron can also appear abundantly in some regions of supernova environment . since the cross section of the neutrino - deuteron reaction is much larger than those for @xmath0h , @xmath0he and @xmath1he , the energy deposition through the deuteron may significantly contribute to the neutrino heating during the dissociation of iron nuclei into light elements and nucleons .    in this paper",

    "we adopt the standard nuclear physics approach(snpa)@xcite . in snpa , we consider the nuclear current consisting of one - body impulse terms and two - body exchange - current terms , and evaluate their matrix element with the nuclear wave functions generated with a high - precision nn potential .",
    "the reliability of our snpa has been extensively tested by comparisons of calculated observables with available data of photo - processes , and also from a good agreement with the results of the effective field theory approach@xcite for the solar neutrino energy .",
    "we calculate the average energy transfer rates ( and the heating rate ) by using the fermi distribution of the neutrino energy , and examine an effect of the @xmath9 reaction on the supernova dynamics in the heating region .",
    "we have in our mind here the typical situation realized in the region between the stalled shock wave and the proto - neutron star surface , where neutrinos are emitted with spectra close to the one under the equilibrium parametrized by the local temperature .",
    "we consider the neutrino reactions on the deuteron through both the cc and nc , covering the deuteron breakup and scattering .",
    "we show that the energy transfer rates through the @xmath9 reactions are much larger than those of @xmath0h , @xmath0he and @xmath1he for the typical range of the neutrino temperature , especially at low temperature ( energy ) because of the lower breakup threshold .",
    "this suggests that the deuteron can contribute , as an extra agent , to the neutrino heating in supernova dynamics .",
