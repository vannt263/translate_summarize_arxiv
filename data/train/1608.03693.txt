    "presence of quenched randomness can drastically change the properties of a system . for systems that undergo continuous transition in their pure state ,",
    "harris @xcite showed that the necessary condition for the disorder to be irrelevant is that the specific heat critical exponent @xmath5 , should be less than zero . extending harris s arguments , imry and wortis@xcite and aizenmann and wehr@xcite showed that the gibbs state is always unique in the presence of disorder in two dimensions .",
    "hence , an infinitesimal disorder should either destroy the order completely or change it to continuous transition .",
    "this was further supported via real space renormalization group calculation in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently , the result has been made rigorous for a large number of classical and quantum systems @xcite . for @xmath6 , in @xcite , via mapping of the interface between the ordered and disordered state to the random field ising model , it was conjectured that there is an impurity threshold below which the transition will retain the first order character .",
    "while the picture for @xmath7 is now pretty clear , we do not have a clear picture in the higher dimensions .",
    "hence , understanding quenched disorder for @xmath6 in systems with first order transition in the pure state , is an important open problem . in this paper",
    "we study a spin-1 model , which has a continuous transition in the absence of crystal field , but has a rich phase diagram with regions of first and second order transitions , separated by a tricritical point , in the presence of crystal field @xcite .    spin-1 model with crystal - field , also known as blume - capel model , was introduced by blume@xcite and capel@xcite separately to explain the first order magnetic transition in materials like @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the model has been very successful in explaining many interesting physical phenomena .",
    "for example , critical behaviour of @xmath9 mixture in random media is modelled well by blume - capel model with random crystal field@xcite . recently",
    ", blume - capel model has been used to study the phenomena of inverse melting@xcite . also , shear induced rigidity in granular materials has been studied via a mapping to the blume - capel model@xcite .",
    "blume - capel model has a rich phase diagram @xcite and it has been one of the most well studied models in statistical mechanics .",
    "effect of random crystal field has also been studied using various techniques like mean field theory@xcite , effective field theory@xcite , bethe lattice@xcite , pair approximation@xcite , renormalization group@xcite , hierarchical lattices@xcite and replica method@xcite . while for @xmath10 using real space renormalization group@xcite it was shown that the system has only a continuous transition in the presence of random field , in agreement with the known rigorous results , situation in higher dimension is not that clear .",
    "different methods do not agree with each other in their prediction of the phase diagram@xcite .",
    "simulations are challenging even for the pure case@xcite , and with disorder averaging it is a formidable task@xcite .",
    "hence , exact solutions are important .    here",
    "we present an exact solution of the blume - capel model with random crystal field on a complete graph using the method of large deviations@xcite .",
    "pure version of the blume - capel model on a fully connected graph was studied earlier using large deviation techniques@xcite .",
    "the method used , though can not be extended to the case with disorder .",
    "our method relies on recognising that the disorder average can be done on the non interacting part for a given magnetisation , as the interacting part of the hamiltonian depends only on the total magnetisation .",
    "we have recently used it to study the spin @xmath11 , @xmath3-spin interaction model@xcite . in this paper , we extend the method to the blume - capel model .",
    "we reproduce the earlier known results for pure blume - capel model . in the random crystal field , we find that beyond a threshold , the first order transition disappears completely ( in agreement with renormalization group flow predictions@xcite ) .",
    "plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we define the model and give the general method of solution in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we solve the pure blume - capel model using large deviations and in section 5 we solve it with bimodal random crystal field .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we consider the blume - capel model on a complete graph , with the hamiltonian given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a configuration of spin variables @xmath14 .",
    "each spin @xmath14 takes three values , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the external random crystal fields .",
    "this system has two order parameters : magnetisation , @xmath17 and magnetic particle density , @xmath18 .",
    "the probability of a particular configuration @xmath19 , for a realization of random field @xmath20 would be given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the inverse of temperature .",
    "and @xmath23 is the normalisation , also known as the partition function , for a given realization of @xmath24 . here",
    "the sequence of both the order parameters as a whole for @xmath25 particle system satisfies large deviation principle(ldp ) with respect to the sequence of probabilities @xmath26 and this result holds , almost surely with respect to the realisation of the random crystal fields under certain assumptions in @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we will show in section [ method ] , that the rate function for the ldp can be calculated through tilting the gartner - ellis theorem@xcite .",
    "note that if a sequence of random variables @xmath27 taking values in a complete separable metric space @xmath28 satisfies ldp with respect to a sequence of probabilities @xmath29 on @xmath28 with rate @xmath25 and continuous rate function @xmath30 , then for any borel set @xmath31 of @xmath28 ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 .",
