    "altruistic behavior among agents in evolving systems , both biological and social , has been widely observed in nature @xcite .",
    "the fact that cooperative behavior can emerge between unrelated individuals in the competitive landscape of natural selection , however , is paradoxical .",
    "evolutionary game theory is widely employed to address this question , and models of evolutionary systems that can exhibit realistic phenomena are of great interest to researchers across disciplines including physics , biology , and the social sciences @xcite .",
    "complex networks have played a central role in the study of evolutionary systems @xcite . in particular , network - based models , where evolution is driven by the discrete replicator dynamics ,",
    "have been shown to support robust cooperation that is unsustainable in traditional models built on unstructured populations . in a network - based model ,",
    "agents occupy the vertices of the network , and interact only within their immediate neighborhood consisting of those agents to whom they are connected by network edges .",
    "interactions take the form of a mathematical game , often the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , which captures in a precise framework the temptation to selfishly advance one s own fitness at the expense of a cooperating neighbor .",
    "evolution is implemented using the replicator dynamics .    in @xcite ,",
    "nowak and may pioneered the network - based approach by showing that cooperation in the pd could become evolutionarily sustainable on a lattice . in @xcite ,",
    "santos and pacheco further showed that cooperation could even become the dominant population trait on certain _ heterogeneous _ networks like those with scale - free degree distributions , where the network s vertices have degrees that follow an inverse power law .",
    "a great deal of subsequent research has focused on the interplay between complex networks and evolutionary dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we show that the equilibrium success of cooperation in an evolutionary pd on a network ( defined precisely below ) can be effectively predicted from a quantitative network parameter derived using a mean field system analysis .",
    "our approach is rooted in the ideas of generating functions associated to random networks @xcite , and uses results from empirical studies of the dynamics .",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions to monte - carlo simulations and find excellent agreement across networks with varying topologies and varying average degrees .",
    "given the inherent complexity of these dynamical systems , the accuracy with which the simple criterion here predicts actual dynamics is especially appealing .",
    "finally , we give an interpretation of the criterion derived here as an analogue of hamilton s rule for kin selection ; a classical result in genetics that explains emerging cooperative behavior among related individuals . in doing so , we are able to apply techniques from the study of complex networks to a modeling problem in evolutionary biology , and arrive at a result that both brings insight to both the factors that drive the model , as well as the social and biological questions that originally inspired the model .",
    "the pd is widely studied as a framework in which to model problems involving conflict and cooperation . two players",
    "choose between cooperation ( c ) and defection ( d ) .",
    "players strategy choices determine ( normalized ) payoffs  interpreted as fitness in evolutionary biology  as follows : mutual cooperation gives r to each player , a defector exploiting a cooperator gets t , and an exploited cooperator gets s. two defectors each give and receive nothing , and payoffs satisfy @xmath0 .",
    "a rational player will choose to defect since the payoffs for defection strictly dominate those of cooperation regardless of the co - player s strategy .",
    "the result is a nash equilibrium where both players defect ; the dilemma arising from the inefficiency of this equilibrium : both agents would fare better by cooperating @xcite .",
    "define the cost @xmath1 of cooperation in the pd to be the payoff forgone ( from a defector s perspective ) by choosing to cooperate , or @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 represent the benefit provided to a co - player by a cooperator , so that @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the cost - to - benefit ratio of the game is @xmath5 the cost - to - benefit ratio indicates of the temptation to defect inherent in the game , with larger @xmath6 corresponding to a stronger temptation to defect .    a widely adopted payoff normalization @xcite sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so that the game depends on the single parameter @xmath9 indicating the temptation toward defection in the game . taking @xmath10 close to zero amounts to an assumption that social interactions are inexpensive . with this normalization ,",
    "the game lies on the boundary between the pd and the snowdrift game ( sg ) , another commonly studied game of cooperation . in the sg , the the bottom two pd game payoffs are reversed so that cooperation is a better unilateral response to defection : @xmath11 . in that case , and setting @xmath12 , @xmath7 , and @xmath13 , the nash equilibrium is @xmath14 , so is close to zero as long as @xmath10 is sufficiently close to zero .",
    "qualitatively , the case of @xmath8 ( the so - called weak pd ) addresses both games when social interactions are inexpensive , so is the focus from here on . while the @xmath15 assumption is both plausible and widely adopted , it is significant , and dropping it has a considerable effect on system dynamics @xcite .",
    "evolution is introduced through repeated interactions between agents with respect to the replicator dynamics .",
    "the replicator dynamics model natural selection using agent fitness comparisons that result in stochastic imitation of fitter strategies by less fit strategies ( details below ) . in the repeated pd",
    ", payoffs are further required to satisfy @xmath16 in order to ensure that full cooperation in the population remains pareto optimal .    when a population of agents is unstructured and agent interactions are random , the replicator dynamics favor defection and cooperation is driven to extinction .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the situation is strikingly different when the population is structured by a network .    consider a network @xmath17 consisting of vertices and undirected edges where neither loops nor multiple edges are allowed .",
    "agents occupy the network s vertices and are constrained to interact only with their immediate neighbors ; those agents with whom they are connected by an edge .",
    "a round consists of each agent playing a pure strategy in a pd with all neighbors , and accumulating the resulting payoffs .",
    "following a round of play , agents simultaneously update strategies using discrete replicator dynamics : if agent @xmath18 has accumulated payoff @xmath19 , and compares her payoff to that of agent @xmath20 , then @xmath18 will adopt the strategy of @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 with @xmath22 equal to the larger of the degrees of vertices @xmath18 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we perform simulations on various specific networks ( details below ) with @xmath23 vertices , in each case starting from a random strategy assignment where the probability of an agent cooperating is @xmath24 .",
    "a _ series _ is defined to consist of @xmath23 rounds of play and updating .",
    "the _ series mean _ is taken to be the average cooperation level over the last 1000 rounds of the series . for a given network",
    ", 100 series are run , and the equilibrium cooperation level is taken to be the average of these 100 series means",
    ".    it is well documented , and summarized below , that cooperation can become evolutionarily stable in network models of this kind . moreover ,",
    "the extent of the evolutionary success of cooperation has been shown to depend greatly on the particular network topology involved @xcite . in order to explore this phenomenon further , we recall some basic tools in the study of networks .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the probability that a random vertex from the network @xmath17 has degree @xmath26 , and let @xmath27 be the random variable that takes values in the set of possible degrees of vertices in the network .",
    "the probability generating function @xcite for the distribution of @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and gives a first - order approximation of network topology .",
    "the degree distribution ignores any other contact information present in the network , so @xmath29 represents a generic network chosen randomly from among all those with the fixed degree distribution .",
    "the average vertex degree @xmath30 in the network is given by @xmath31 .    if an edge is randomly chosen from the network and followed to a vertex at one end , it is @xmath26 times more likely to lead to a vertex of degree @xmath26 than a vertex of degree 1 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath32 is the random variable whose values are the degrees of vertices reached along random edges , then the probability generating function of @xmath32 is    [ uncorrelated neighbor ] @xmath33    define a _ random neighbor _ to be the vertex reached by first choosing a random vertex in the network , followed by a random edge emanating from that vertex .",
    "if no degree - degree correlations are present in the network , then it follows that @xmath34 is the probability generating function for the degree distribution of random neighbors",
    ". the average degree of a random neighbor @xmath35 is therefore the expected value of @xmath32 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "note that when the probability of an edge leading from a degree @xmath37 vertex to a degree @xmath26 vertex is not independent of @xmath37 , then @xmath35 need not equal @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the mean field parameters @xmath35 and @xmath30 , of course , require sufficiently large systems to be meaningful @xcite .",
    "a critical factor emerging from studies of cooperation phenomena is network heterogeneity @xcite . in heterogeneous networks , a broad diversity of vertex degrees",
    "are represented . in the context of the evolutionary pd",
    ", network heterogeneity has been shown to be strongly correlated with increased success of cooperators @xcite .",
    "on certain scale - free networks , for example , cooperation can be the dominant population trait for the full range of pd game parameters .",
    "heterogeneity can be naturally quantified by the variance of the degree distribution . with @xmath39 denoting the expected value of the random variable @xmath27 , and @xmath40 denoting the expected value of @xmath41 , one has @xmath42 = \\langle k^2\\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle^2 $ ] . using the notation above , @xmath43= g'(1)t'(1 )",
    "- g'(1)^2 = v(n - v).\\ ] ] if we fix the average network degree @xmath30 , then @xmath44 , or the size difference between an average neighbor and an average vertex in the network , dictates network heterogeneity .",
    "since cooperation thrives on heterogeneous networks , @xmath44 emerges as a critical network parameter and has been studied in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we introduce a framework that explains this fact in the context of the specifics of the evolutionary pd .      in the evolutionary pd ,",
    "payoffs flow through connections to cooperators , and agents benefit from maximizing their access thereto .",
    "it is well known that cooperation can thrive through the formation of clusters of cooperating agents @xcite . moreover , when social interactions are inexpensive ( @xmath10 close to zero ) , cooperators of large degree are especially stable @xcite . by contrast , as a large defector converts her neighborhood to defectors , she significantly reduces her own payoff and becomes susceptible to takeover by a cooperator .",
    "for this reason , larger degree vertices have been shown to disproportionately favor cooperation @xcite .",
    "a more detailed picture of the dynamics emerges in @xcite . for low temptation to defect , cooperation is the social norm .",
    "as the temptation to defect increases , the dynamics are governed by three populations : a core ( or cores ) of cooperating agents , a core ( or cores ) of defecting agents , and a critical fluctuating population of sometime - cooperators and sometime - defectors . the resilience of cooperators , as discussed in @xcite , is determined by interactions between agents on the border of a cooperator core .",
    "when the temptation to defect is too high , defectors eventually invade the core by stripping off layer upon layer of exposed cooperators until they are largely eradicated from the population .",
    "since the growth or breakdown of a cooperator core is determined by the core s exposure to fluctuating nodes , that is where we focus our analysis . consider an interaction on the frontier of a cooperating cluster .",
    "using the mean field network parameters @xmath35 and @xmath30 , we address the question of predicting the particular value of the cost - to - benefit ratio , call it @xmath45 , at which point neither a cooperator nor a defector has an advantage ( on average ) . at @xmath46",
    "one expects each strategy to be equally successful , and a resulting equilibrium where cooperation and defection are approximately equally prevalent .",
    "thus , @xmath46 is a predicted threshold at which point the system transitions between dominant ( defined as more than @xmath47 ) cooperation and dominant defection .",
    "given the description of the dynamics in @xcite ( and outlined above ) , we consider interactions between agents on the boundary of a cluster of cooperators with the goal of deriving a criterion to calculate @xmath46 .    of course ,",
    "within a cooperator or defector core , no strategy changes occur as a cooperator ( resp .",
    "defector ) considers the success of a another cooperator ( resp .",
    "defector ) .",
    "the dynamics are determined by interactions between differing strategists .",
    "first we analyze a defecting vertex , representing a chain of potentially advancing defectors , and connected to a cooperating neighbor on the border of a core of cooperators .",
    "our assumptions give the defector , @xmath48 , the average network degree @xmath30 , while her cooperating neighbor , @xmath49 , has the average network neighbor size @xmath35 .",
    "finally , assume that @xmath49 has @xmath26 defecting neighbors while @xmath48 has @xmath50 defecting neighbors .",
    "we consider the relative costs and benefits associated to the strategies ( as opposed to pure payoffs ) in this situation , with costs and benefits as in eq .",
    "( [ cbr ] ) .",
    "the cooperator perceives the collective value of defection in a round of play to be @xmath51 .",
    "the defector , meanwhile , sees the cooperator receiving a benefit @xmath3 from each of her cooperative neighbors , but also sees this benefit mitigated by the cost of each cooperative act . from the defector s perspective",
    ", the value of cooperation is @xmath52 .",
    "[ graph_sit ] shows the situation when @xmath53 , that is , when both agents are maximally cooperator connected , and thus have maximal strength in the sense of evolutionary fitness .     the critical frontier between a defector chain ( blue ) and a cooperator cluster ( red ) .",
    "the darker colored vertices are labeled with the respective costs and benefits associated to those strategies and collected over one round of play .",
    "comparison of these values in the context of strategy updating leads to the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) . ]",
    "since @xmath46 is the cost - to - benefit ratio at which point neither agent perceives an advantage in the other s strategy , we can predict @xmath46 by equating the collective benefits of the @xmath54 strategy and the @xmath55-strategy .",
    "this gives @xmath56 rearranging , we get @xmath57 substituting @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and inserting the normalized payoffs @xmath12 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 gives @xmath60    finally , we add an assumption that near @xmath61 , the term @xmath62 .",
    "this amounts to an assumption that when an average cooperator and average defector are connected by an edge , their respective numbers of defecting neighbors are comparable . that this assumption is true in actual simulations",
    "is verified below .",
    "conversely , consider a randomly chosen cooperator @xmath64 on a frontier , compared to her randomly chosen neighbor @xmath65 .",
    "as above , let @xmath50 and @xmath26 be the numbers of defector neighbors of @xmath66 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the same argument this time yields the condition @xmath67 now , however , the condition is statistically unsustainable since @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . during the system s evolution ,",
    "smaller cooperators not inside a cluster are stripped away . as a result",
    ", cooperators must migrate to larger vertices in order to survive , leaving the first scenario already analyzed above .",
    "this framework suggests the following : natural selection favors cooperation when the cost - to - benefit ratio of the cooperative act is smaller than the relative size difference between an average neighbor and an average vertex , divided by the average neighbor size : @xmath70 the term @xmath71 , which is purely a network parameter as well as a natural measure of network heterogeneity on a zero - to - one scale , should mark the phase transition from dominant cooperation ( more than half the population cooperating ) to dominant defection ( more than half the population defecting ) .         the actual probability distribution of @xmath72 , the difference in the number of @xmath54-neighbors over all @xmath55-@xmath54 edges .",
    "simulations were run on a network with @xmath73 vertices , and with average degree @xmath74 and average neighbor degree @xmath75 .",
    "the data in the histogram was collected from simulations performed with @xmath76 , and equilibrium cooperation level of @xmath77 after @xmath23 rounds of play . at @xmath78 ,",
    "cooperation levels are below @xmath24 . ]    to test the accuracy of eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) , we perform simulations on networks with various degree distributions .",
    "networks with @xmath79 vertices , and average degree @xmath80 are constructed via a two step process introduced in @xcite .",
    "first , a network is generated using the algorithm in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses a single parameter @xmath81 to interpolate between an erds - rnyi random network ( er ) @xcite , and a barabsi - albert scale free network ( ba ) @xcite . starting from a complete graph on @xmath82 vertices , one of the remaining @xmath83 vertices",
    "is chosen .",
    "this vertex has @xmath84 edges to attach as follows . with probability @xmath85",
    ", the vertex attaches an edge to an existing vertex with a probability proportional to the existing vertex s degree ( i.e. , by preferential attachment ) . with probability @xmath81",
    ", the edge is connected to any of the existing @xmath86 network vertices with a fixed probability .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath84 times , once for each edge .",
    "when @xmath87 , one obtains a ba network with a power law degree distribution , and when @xmath88 one obtains an er random graph .",
    "intermediate @xmath81 give hybrid distributions with intermediate levels of heterogeneity between the heterogeneous ba networks and the essentially homogeneous er random networks .",
    "networks are generated with @xmath89 vertices , and average degree @xmath90 .",
    "for each value of @xmath80 , networks are generated with @xmath91 .",
    "finally , each network is distilled down to its degree distribution by throwing away all other contact information , and a new uncorrelated network is reconfigured , consistent with that degree distribution , using the configuration model @xcite .",
    "the result is a maximally random network with the specified degree distribution .",
    "the point of this choice of networks is not any particular topology , but rather , to give a range of varied topologies with varied heterogeneity as measured by @xmath71 .",
    "the results of the simulations described above are consistent with previous work , and are summarized in fig . [ fogs ] below .      the temperature plot in fig .",
    "[ fogs ] shows that the data are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions , proving the effectiveness of the mean field parameters @xmath35 and @xmath30 , and validating the framework leading to eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) .",
    "in particular , the black lines in each panel mark the predicted ( by eq . [ normrule ] ) @xmath61 , as a function of @xmath71 , where cooperators and defectors are expected to be at equal strength , and so , are predicted to be equally prevalent .",
    "actual transitions from dominant cooperation ( darker red ) to dominant defection ( darker blue ) occur in the neutral tan colored regions between red and blue .",
    "indeed , the black prediction line passes through the neutral , or nearly neutral , regions of the temperature plot .",
    "statistical fluctuations are most prominent when @xmath92 , while for @xmath74 and @xmath93 , the predictions are extremely accurate .",
    "this is not surprising in light of eq .",
    "( [ normrule_nbr ] ) , and the fact that when @xmath92 , values of @xmath35 are smallest , and the term @xmath94 most affects the value of @xmath61 .",
    "we note that the mean field framework leading to eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) is extremely versatile , giving accurate predictions across networks with very different distributions , different levels of heterogeneity , and different average degrees .",
    "additionally , we have checked that the criterion also holds on random regular graphs with average degrees @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , where cooperation is virtually eliminated immediately , as predicted by eq . ( [ normrule ] ) .",
    "we turn to the assumption that simplifies eq .",
    "( [ normrule_nbr ] ) ; namely , that the numbers of @xmath54-neighbors of the average agents at either end of a @xmath55-@xmath54 edge are comparable . while the accuracy of the predictions in fig .",

    "[ hist ] shows a histogram of the distribution of differences in the numbers of @xmath54-neighbors over all edges connecting a cooperator and a defector , normalized by @xmath35 .",

    "inserting @xmath103 , one gets @xmath106 , and the network parameter of eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) appears again .",
    "this seems to be a kind of mean value relationship , where the global average cooperation level taken over all values of the cost - to - benefit ratio also gives the local transition value @xmath46 .",
    "finally , notice the similarity between the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ normrule ] ) and hamilton s rule for kin selection . despite arising in a completely separate context , hamilton s rule gives a genetic criterion for the emergence of altruistic behavior between individuals when the _ genetic relatedness _ of the individuals exceeds the cost - to - benefit ratio of the altruistic act .",
    "genetic relatedness is measured by the probability that two genes randomly selected from each individual at the same locus are identical by descent @xcite . in the context of a social network ,",
    "the parameter @xmath71 serves as a natural definition for a notion of _ social relatedness_. like genetic relatedness , social relatedness lies in the interval @xmath107 , with larger values indicating increased relatedness . if two networks have the same fixed average agent size @xmath30 , then there is more social cohesion in networks with larger , more influential neighbors . as a result",
    ", @xmath35 emerges as the parameter governing social viscosity @xcite , where larger neighbors increasingly facilitate relatedness , and through this , cooperation .",
    "similar parallels have been drawn before , particularly in @xcite where a weak selection model was considered , but does nt appear relevant to the case of strong selection considered here as it fails to distinguish between networks with different topologies , but the same average degree .    in conclusion , we have shown that a simple analytical framework , using basic ideas form the theory of complex networks , can effectively predict the success of cooperation in an evolutionary pd on varied network topologies . moreover , the analysis suggests a network - based evolutionary rule that nicely parallels hamilton s classical genetic rule for kin selection ."
