    "in this talk we discuss so(10 ) yukawa unification and its ramifications for phenomenology .",
    "the initial constraints come from fitting the top , bottom and tau masses , requiring large @xmath0 and particular values for soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "we will show that this leads to a spectrum of squark and slepton masses with the first two families heavy while the third family is significantly lighter , i.e. an inverted scalar mass hierarchy .",
    "in addition , gauginos should be observable at the lhc .",
    "we perform a global @xmath1 analysis , fitting the recently observed ` higgs ' with mass of order 125 gev in addition to fermion masses and mixing angles and several flavor violating observables .",
    "fermion masses and mixing angles are manifestly hierarchical .",
    "the simplest way to describe this hierarchy is with yukawa matrices which are also hierarchical .",
    "moreover the most natural way to obtain the hierarchy is in terms of effective higher dimension operators of the form @xmath2 this version of so(10 ) models has the nice features that it only requires small representations of so(10 ) , has many predictions and can , in principle , find an uv completion in string theory .",
    "there are a long list of papers by authors such as albright , anderson , babu , barr , barbieri , berezhiani , blazek , carena , chang , dermisek , dimopoulos , hall , masiero , murayama , pati , raby , romanino , rossi , starkman , wagner , wilczek , wiesenfeldt , and willenbrock which have followed this line of model building .",
    "the only renormalizable term in @xmath3 is @xmath4 which gives yukawa coupling unification @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "note , one can not predict the top mass due to large susy threshold corrections to the bottom and tau masses , as shown in @xcite .",
    "these corrections are of the form @xmath7 so instead we use yukawa unification to predict the soft susy breaking masses ! ! in order to fit the data , we need @xmath8 we take @xmath9 , thus we need @xmath10 . for a short list of references on this subject ,",

    "it is very interesting that the above region in susy parameter space results in an inverted scalar mass hierarchy at the weak scale with the third family scalars significantly lighter than the first two families @xcite .",
