    "<S> recent work has unveiled a new class of optical systems that can exhibit the characteristic features of superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> one such system relies on the repulsive photon - photon interaction that is mediated by a thermal optical nonlinearity and is therefore inherently nonlocal due to thermal diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate how such a nonlocal interaction , which at a first inspection would not be expected to lead to superfluid behavior , may be tailored by acting upon the geometry of the photon fluid itself . </S>",
    "<S> our models and measurements show that restricting the laser profile and hence the photon fluid to a strongly elliptical geometry modifies thermal diffusion along the major beam axis and reduces the effective nonlocal interaction length by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn enables the system to display a characteristic trait of superfluid flow : the nucleation of quantized vortices in the flow past an extended physical obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> these results are general and apply to other nonlocal fluids , such as dipolar bose - einstein condensates , and show that `` thermal '' photon superfluids provide an exciting and novel experimental environment for probing the nature of superfluidity , with applications to the study of quantum turbulence and analogue gravity .    over the past decade , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical and experimental studies of photon fluids have opened new routes to realizing quantum many - body systems . in the most general case , a photon fluid </S>",
    "<S> is created by propagating a laser beam through a defocusing nonlinear medium such that the photons in the beam act as a gas of weakly interacting particles @xcite . as in atomic many - body systems , </S>",
    "<S> the collective photon behavior can be described by a gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , where the electric field plays the role of the order parameter , a macroscopic wave function with a clear resemblance to dilute - gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and superfluid helium . </S>",
    "<S> much research with photon fluids has therefore centered on exploring characteristics of superfluidity , such as the nucleation of vortices of quantized circulation in the flow past an obstacle for sufficiently high flow speeds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + significant progress on this front has been made in the field of _ polariton _ fluids , strongly coupled exciton - polaritons in semiconductor microcavities , that have shown superfluid characteristics , such as the frictionless flow around an obstacle @xcite , and shedding of solitons @xcite and quantized vortices @xcite . differently from these driven - dissipative systems with a _ </S>",
    "<S> local _ </S>",
    "<S> nonlinearity , signatures of superfluid behavior in the dispersion relation have also been observed for room - temperature , _ nonlocal _ photon fluids in a propagating geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system , heating induced by a laser beam leads to a decrease in the refractive index of the propagation medium and a consequent defocusing effect for the laser beam , resulting in an effective repulsive photon - photon interaction established by the medium . </S>",
    "<S> for a monochromatic beam , the transverse beam profile acts to define the geometry of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluid and is fully described by hydrodynamic equations , where the propagation direction maps on to an effective time coordinate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to heat diffusion , this interaction is inherently nonlocal , i.e. , the photon density at one point in space influences the interactions at a distant point . </S>",
    "<S> photon - photon interactions are therefore effectively spread out over distances of the order of the characteristic thermal diffusion ( or nonlocal ) length . </S>",
    "<S> while solitons and vortex solitons have previously been reported in these systems @xcite , the nonlocal aspect of the interaction has only recently attracted attention @xcite , enabling studies of novel shock front and turbulence dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of the fluid nonlocality in the context of superfluidity is a reduction and even cancellation of the effect of interactions on intermediate length scales and a restoration of the standard single - particle dispersion relation for excitations in the medium at much lower wavevectors than the inverse healing length . </S>",
    "<S> while one can expect that this effect may result in the inhibition of superfluid behavior in generic nonlocal superfluids such as dipolar atomic becs , the interplay of nonlocality and superfluidity has not yet been completely explored in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> + here we analyze in detail the nature of a propagating laser beam s thermal photon - photon interactions mediated by a dilute dispersion of graphene nanoflakes in methanol . </S>",
    "<S> our primary result is that with a suitable configuration of the photon fluid s geometry , as determined by the laser beam s transverse profile , nonlocal interactions can exist simultaneously with characteristics of superfluidity , as evidenced by the nucleation of quantized vortices in the photon fluid s flow past an obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> analytically , we start with a model that accounts for the boundary conditions of the system . by </S>",
    "<S> introducing a distributed loss term in the heat diffusion equation , we recover and thus justify the lorentzian response function that has been used in many previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that , for fixed boundary conditions , changing the geometry of the photon fluid , e.g. by using a highly elliptical rather than circular beam , enables us to control and reduce the effective nonlocal interaction length by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of beam geometry has the primary effect of restoring locality to a sufficient extent so as to restore superfluid behavior . </S>",
    "<S> with such an elliptical beam , we experimentally demonstrate evidence of superfluidity in nonlocal photon fluids revealed by the nucleation of quantized vortices in the wake of an extended obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> + _ photon fluids : _ although the findings of this work are general and apply to any nonlocal superfluid , we derive the main conclusions by focusing our attention on the specific case of a thermal photon fluid where the photon - photon interaction is mediated by heating induced by the local intensity of a propagating laser beam . </S>",

    "<S> we assume a beam that occupies the central region of the fluid , far from the system s physical boundaries , so that the system is approximately shift - invariant with @xmath33 with the constant @xmath34 accounting for the properties of the material , and @xmath35 . for a thermal nonlinearity such as that provided by the methanol - graphene system , the temperature dependent change in the index of refraction is @xmath36 where @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> summarizing this first result , the experimental measurement of the response function indicates that the dlm provides a good approximation to both the measured @xmath60 and to the exact numerical solution to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> + we next turn to the analytical dlm solution to describe how the beam or fluid geometry may be used to control the nonlocal interaction length . we first point out that for a medium with physical boundaries , as in the experiments described below and in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a cylindrically symmetric beam with @xmath61 beam radii @xmath62 implies superfluid behavior only for very low wavevectors such that @xmath63 where the response function approaches a local response @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> however , accessing these wavevectors is experimentally unrealistic as it requires observation and measurement of waves in the transverse plane of the beam that have a wavelength that is of the order of the size of the medium itself . </S>",
    "<S> + however , the situation is more interesting in the case of an elliptical beam geometry with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the focused beam radius @xmath66 leads to a temperature distribution whose width scales with @xmath67 along the @xmath68-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this focusing along the @xmath68-axis also leads to enhanced thermal diffusion away from the major axis of the beam aligned with the @xmath69-axis , as may be seen by applying the approximation @xmath70 in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> within this approximation we may use an effective one - dimensional heat equation , resulting in an effective 1d response function @xmath71 with the introduction of an effective nonlocal length , @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the key point here is that focusing along the @xmath68-axis decreases the length scale for thermal diffusion to @xmath73 along both major and minor beam axes . </S>",
    "<S> thus our elliptical geometry can lead to superfluid behavior for the range @xmath74 , which is now experimentally accessible . </S>",
    "<S> a circular beam with @xmath75 may seem an option , but is impractical from an experimental standpoint since the spatial extent of the fluid would then be too small to observe superfluid behavior such as vortex nucleation in the flow past an obstacle . +    . </S>",

    "<S> black curve : the analytical solution from the dlm model with @xmath79 cm . </S>",
    "<S> all curves are normalized to one.,width=264 ]    we arrive at an alternative view of the effective geometry - induced tailoring of the medium response by considering the spatial extent of the focused spot size @xmath67 and the associated @xmath68-component of the wavevector @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is largest wavelength oscillation supported by the spatial extent of the minor axis of the elliptical photon fluid , such that @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we may then determine the @xmath52-space response function by first numerically solving the full 2d heat equation and taking the fourier transform to obtain @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that either integrating the response function over all @xmath84 or simply taking @xmath85 gives similar functions . in the latter case , the dlm response function may again be rewritten as @xmath71 , and together with eq .   </S>",
    "<S> provides good agreement with the dispersion relation reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dlm approach explicitly indicates that the highly elliptical geometry of the beam leads to an effective 1d response function with a nonlocal length , which in the limit @xmath86 loses all trace of the physical boundary conditions and is essentially determined solely by the beam or fluid geometry , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a clear route to re - establishing and controlling the onset of superfluid behavior in an otherwise highly nonlocal and non - superfluid medium . </S>",
    "<S> + _ superfluidity and vortices : _ in order to verify our findings we performed a series of experiments and numerical simulations with both round and highly elliptical pump beams , aimed at observing a characteristic trait of superfluid flow , namely quantized vortex nucleation in supercritical flows around an obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly describe the characteristics of quantized vortices in superfluids . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of quantized vortices has been of great interest ever since their discovery in @xmath87he @xcite and later in becs @xcite , and their inherent dynamics are intensively studied in quantum turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , due to the relatively short coherence length in @xmath87he , the vortex core diameter is of the order of a few ngstrms and is hard to visualize by optical means , although progress has been made using hydrogen tracer particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in becs and photon fluids , the diluteness of the fluid leads to larger healing lengths , with vortex core diameters on the order of half a micron and tens of microns respectively , allowing for direct observation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in photon fluids straightforward optical interferometry provides easy access to phase information and thus photon fluids provide an accessible platform to study quantized vortex dynamics , where core position , circulation and winding number can be easily identified . + _ experiments : _ the experimental setup is shown in fig .

    "<S> the beam is loosely focused onto the sample by a set of cylindrical lenses with a minor axis @xmath61 beam radius of @xmath97 m ( the major axis radius is @xmath98 cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is placed in one arm of a mach - zehnder interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the other arm is used to probe the spatial phase profile of the sample output plane with a reference beam . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> a piezo - controlled delay stage is introduced in order to retrieve the full phase information by a phase - shifting interferometry technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the intensity profile of the beam at the cell output is imaged with 4x magnification onto a ccd camera . as an obstacle , </S>",
    "<S> a knife blade is immersed in the sample along the beam path [ see inset ( a ) , fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence there exists a critical velocity @xmath106 for which a fluid with flow speed @xmath107 behaves as a superfluid and is not perturbed by small defects inserted in the flow . for local fluids , </S>",
    "<S> the critical velocity is determined by the speed of sound . however , as discussed in the appendix , the nonlocality can significantly reduce the critical velocity . for our experimental parameters , </S>",
    "<S> this reduction amounts to approximately a factor of two . </S>",
