    "our current galaxy formation paradigm states that galaxies acquire their angular momentum by a mechanism known as tidal torquing ( sciama 1955 ; peebles 1969 ; doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) . in this paradigm , tidal fields generated from the large - scale structure excerpt a torquing on the protogalactic object prior to gravitational collapse .",
    "the acquired angular momentum is conserved during collapse and their value will dictate the formation and orientation of the galactic disks .",
    "one important consequence of the tidal torquing theory ( ttt ) is an expected relation between the large - scale structure and the orientation of the angular momentum of the galaxies within it ( see a recent review by schfer 2009 ) .    from the observational point of view ,",
    "navarro et al . ( 2004 ) found a notable ( with a significance of 92% ) excess of edge - on spiral galaxies ( for which the orientation of the disk rotation axis may be determined unambiguously ) highly inclined relative to the supergalactic plane .",
    "trujillo et al . ( 2006 ) perform a measurement of the rotation axes of galaxies situated on the shells of large cosmic voids and found that the angular momentum of these objects tend to be aligned perpendicular to the radial direction of the void with a significance of 99.7% ( see also slosar & white 2009 ) .",
    "lee & erdogdu ( 2007 ) combined a reconstruction of the density tidal shear field from the 2mass redshift survey with the spin field derived from the tully galaxy catalogue and found a correlation strength at the 6@xmath0 significance level .    from the numerical perspective",
    ", the orientation of the halos within their large - scale cosmic structure has been investigated by several authors ( bailin & steinmetz 2005 ; patiri et al .",
    "2006 ; brunino et al . 2007",
    "; aragn - calvo et al . 2007 ; cuesta et al .",
    "in particular , patiri et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and brunino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) investigated the alignment of dark matter halos within the shells of large cosmic voids and provided evidence that the minor axis of the dark matter halos points preferentially to the centres of the voids .",
    "the intermediate and major axis were found to be preferentially oriented perpendicularly to the void direction .",
    "in addition , cuesta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found , with high significance , a preferential alignment between the angular momentum of the halo and the void direction .",
    "as for real galaxies , the angular momentum of the halos tend also to be aligned perpendicular to the radial direction of the void .",
    "although the orientation of the galaxies and halos within the large - scale structure has been identified both observationally and numerically , there has not been any previous quantitative study neither of the relationship between the various kind of alignments already determined , nor of the connection between these alignments and the existing results for the positioning of the angular momentum with respect to the halo axes . in this paper",
    "we use and discuss several previous results concerning the alignments of halo axes and angular momentum with respect to their corresponding voids for those halos lying in the shells of the voids .",
    "not all these results are independent , so we intend to establish a convenient set of independent results from which all other results may be obtained .",
    "to this end we shall present the needed mathematical identities relating the various kind of alignments that we shall consider , and use them to infer the set of independent results that we shall choose .",
    "then we shall show that , using the appropriate mathematical relationships , all previous results can be derived , thereby proving their consistency . in this way we shall not only present previous results in a compact and ordered fashion , but",
    "shall also present results whose form is valid for the alignment with respect to features of the large scale structure other than voids .    in section 2 ,",
    "we show how to characterise uniquely the statistics of the orientation of the halos in the shells of the voids with respect to their corresponding voids and how the alignments of the various halo axes may be derived from it . in section 3",
    ", we provide a motivated model for the probability distribution for the orientation of the angular momentum of a randomly chosen halo with respect to its axes .",
    "then , through a modification of this model , we obtain a model for the alignment of the angular momentum with respect to the halo axis for a halo in the neighbourhood of a void ( or , in general , within a large scale tidal field ) . using this model along with the statistics for the orientation of the halo with respect to the void we obtain the probability distribution for the alignment of the angular momentum with the radial direction of the void .",
    "then , comparing this distribution with that found in simulations , we calibrate that model , inferring a very substantial dependence of the alignment of the angular momentum with respect to the halo axes on the environment .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss the relationship between the alignment of the angular momentum of the halo at the moment of turn around and at present , and how any uncertainty in the determination of the angle of the rotation axis of galaxies with respect to the radial vector joining the centre of the corresponding void with the galaxy diminishes the strength of the alignment . a discussion and a summary of conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we shall first consider the alignments of the three halo axes with respect to the void radial direction .",

    "( 2007 ) and cuesta et al .",

    "it was argued that all positional information of halos with respect to the void may be encoded by the three euler angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) that transform the three axes of the halo into the local orthogonal base ( i.e. the void radial direction , and the directions along parallels and meridians for any arbitrarily chosen set of geographical coordinates on the shell of the voids ) .",
    "we call @xmath1 the angle between the major axis and the radial vector joining the centre of the void with the centre of the dark matter halo , @xmath2 the angle between the direction perpendicular to the major axis within the plane of the void and the minor axis , and @xmath3 the angle between the direction perpendicular to the major axis within the plane of the void and the direction along the local parallel ( see curve a in fig .",
    "1 ) . given the isotropy of the problem within the plane of the void , @xmath3 must be uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath4 .",
    "this was checked in simulations , for consistency , by cuesta et al .",
    "note that since these euler angles determine the position of three orthogonal axes rather than a set of three orthogonal vectors , we have @xmath1@xmath5[0,@xmath4/2 ] , @xmath2@xmath5[0,@xmath4 ] and @xmath3@xmath5[0,@xmath4 ] .",
    "if the shape of the halos were not aligned with any particular direction , @xmath7 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 will be distributed uniformly .",
    "however , the numerical simulations have shown that halos are not oriented randomly within the large scale structure .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath1 has been explored by mean of several simulations . in the particular case of halos within a shell with a thickness of 4 h@xmath8mpc around voids larger than 10 h@xmath8mpc ( defined by not containing halos with masses larger than 7.6 @xmath910@xmath10h@xmath8m@xmath11 ) , the simulations have shown that this probability distribution can be well described by the following expression :    @xmath12^{3/2 } } ; \\mu\\equiv cos\\theta \\label{probcos}\\ ] ]    with p a free parameter that is found to be 1.111@xmath130.004 ( see e.g. cuesta et al .",
    "cuesta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also have studied in the simulations the distribution of the angle @xmath2 .",
    "they found that the distribution have a small , but highly significant , departure from uniformity .",
    "given the small amplitude of this non - uniformity , we propose the following expression containing the simplest @xmath2 dependent term which is even with respect to @xmath14/2 .",
    "this is a condition that must be satisfied due to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "@xmath15    this expression is able to describe fairly well the data from the simulations with @xmath16=-0.093@xmath130.005 .",
    "this means that it is more likely to find the minor axis perpendicular to the intersection of the plane of the void with the plane defined by the middle and minor axes than parallel to this intersection .",
    "the opposite is obviously true for the middle axis .",
    "note that in the above expression @xmath2 is assumed to take values between 0 and @xmath4/2 . as we mentioned above",
    ", @xmath2 actually goes between 0 and @xmath4 , but due to the symmetry of p(@xmath2 ) around @xmath2=@xmath4/2 it is not necessary to consider values of @xmath2 larger than @xmath4/2 ( even though the position @xmath2 is not , in general , equivalent to @xmath4-@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , we would like to stress that in the process of deriving the forthcoming mathematical identities @xmath2 is assumed to go from 0 to @xmath4 and it is only in the final expressions that the symmetry of p(@xmath2 ) is exploited , so that in all the final expressions @xmath2 is assumed to be between 0 and @xmath4/2 .    from the two expressions we have stated before",

    "on doing this we obtain : @xmath21=1.483@xmath16 .",
    "we may now note that the same physical cause ( the shear of the velocity field ) originates the departure of the distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath2 from uniformity .",
    "both effects are of the same order on the shear .",
    "consequently , to leading order the quantity determining the departure from uniformity of @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) must be proportional to the quantity determining the departure of @xmath2 from uniformity ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",

    "[ probcospsi ] we may obtain any statistic concerning the orientation of the halos with respect to the voids .",

    "this dependence is produced by the tidal field on the shell of the voids which causes the minor axis to be more aligned with the radial direction than in the isotropic case , while the opposite is true for angular momentum .",
    "if that dependence did not exist , that is , if the pdf for the orientation of the angular momentum with respect to halo axis for halos in the shells of voids were the same as for randomly chosen halos ( i.e. following an unconditional pdf ) then the angular momentum would show the same kind of alignment with the radial direction than the minor axis and opposite to that found in simulations . in the past , and under the assumption that the angular momentum pdf is independent of the environment , there has been some confusion when interpreting the alignments of halo axis and angular momentum with the void radial direction .",
    "* we have shown that the strength of the predicted alignment of the angular momentum with the void radial direction , as given by the ttt , it is twice as large as the one actually measured in simulations ( as parametrised in this work by p-1 ) .",
    "to model this degradation of the signal we have convolved the angular momentum pdf characterised by a certain parameter p ( eq . [ probcos ] ) with an analytical fit ( based on previous results ) that describes the pdf for the angle between the initial torque and the present angular momentum ( porciani et al . 2002 ) . as long as p-1@xmath991 the resulting distribution",
    "is also well described by the expression given in eq .",
    "[ probcos ] with a value of p@xmath107 such that 1-p@xmath107=(1-p)/2 . understanding this degradation is a necessary step towards a fully theoretical explanation of the alignment of the angular momentum with the void radial direction found in simulations . in a future work ( betancort - rijo & trujillo 2010 )",
    "we shall show that the ttt predicts , for the voids under consideration , a value of the strength of p@xmath1081.06 for the initial alignment , so a value of p@xmath1081.03 should correspond to the alignment of the present angular momentum , as found in simulations .",
    "* we have also convolved the initial angular momentum pdf with a gaussian pdf to model the observational errors on measuring the angle between the angular momentum and the void radial direction . for real galaxies",
    "this error arises both from the uncertainty on estimating the direction of the galaxy rotation axis as well as from the error on determining the void radial direction due to the redshift distortion .",
    "we have shown that up to a r.m.s . of roughly 15%",
    "the intrinsic alignment is basically unaffected .    in the present work we have dealt explicitly with large cosmic voids , but all expressions may be used whenever the orientation of the halos or galaxies with respect to the large scale structure ( or more precisely , the orientation with respect to the proper axes of the deformation tensor or the tidal tensor on large scale ) is considered . in order to use the expressions proposed in this paper in more general cases , two considerations are in order .",
    "first , the pdf for the orientation of halos ( eq . [ probcospsi ] ) may show in general a dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in any expression involving integrals of p@xmath18 , the dependence on @xmath3 must be considered and that expression must also be integrated over @xmath3 and divided by 2@xmath4 .",
    "second , the ratios @xmath16@xmath107/(p-1 ) ( see expression [ betaexpression ] ) and @xmath67/(p-1 ) ( see expression [ alphaexpression ] ) have been determined using halos within certain shells of cosmic voids . however , from general considerations about the mechanisms generating the alignments it follows that these ratios should be essentially independent of the voids used ( as long as p-1@xmath991 ) .",
    "in other cases ( i.e. walls or filaments ) the same considerations lead to the constancy of the first ratio . the effect described by the second ratio ( i.e. the dependence on environment of the orientation of the angular momentum with respect to the halo axes ) does not depend just on the present deformation tensor , but also on its deformation history ( we will show that on betancort - rijo & trujillo 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , its value could depend on the kind of structure considered .",
    "this dependence , though , should be expected to be small , but as much as it can be measured it might provide an interesting test for the standard ( and non - standards ) model of the large - scale structure formation .",
