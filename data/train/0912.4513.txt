    "optical traps consisting of one single focused laser beam were used to produce degenerate fermi gases @xcite , fermi gas mixtures @xcite , to achieve condensation of @xmath0 @xcite , and they are a popular way to trap and store cold gases for multiple needs @xcite .",
    "usually the potential of such an optical trap is approximated harmonically for low average temperatures of the atoms compared to the trap depth @xcite .",
    "for some applications , however , e.g. for evaporative cooling , typical temperatures need not be that low .",

    "the phase space is divided into planck cells of size @xmath17 such that the density of states becomes @xmath18    in the following it turns out to be convenient to work with a scaled energy ( which is zero at the trap center and one at the threshold ) and the accompanying scaled density of states : @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "remarkably , inserting the full dipole trap potential ( [ eqdipolpot ] ) in the semiclassical formula ( [ eqsemiclassic ] ) allows us to express the density of states in terms of known special functions .",
    "we find @xmath21    here , @xmath22 is a dimensionless constant ( see below for a more convenient expression ) and @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the elliptic integrals @xcite of the first and second kind , respectively , with @xmath25 expanding expression ( [ eqzustandsdichtedipolfalle ] ) up to second order for small energies leads to the well - known density of states of the harmonic oscillator potential ( [ eqharmonic ] ) , as expected .",

    "bose - einstein condensation occurs once the total number of atoms exceeds the maximum possible number of atoms in excited states which is set by the bose distribution @xmath36 with zero chemical potential . in other words , using our scaled units , the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation for a given total atom number @xmath37 in the trap is here determined by @xcite , @xmath38     of the dipole trap potential ( black , solid line ) and its harmonic approximation ( blue , dashed line ) for @xmath39 .",

    ", width=245 ]    the figure reveals that the number density @xmath40 diverges for the dipole trap near the potential edge while it stays finite for its harmonic approximation .",
    "well below the singularity , i.e. for small energies , the agreement between the two improves for increasing @xmath45 , i.e. for lower temperatures : then the atoms are closer to the trap minimum , where the potential is well characterized by the harmonic approximation . for higher temperatures the atoms populate states of higher energy , where the harmonic potential differs significantly from the dipole trap . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the product @xmath40 keeps the singularity from the density of states and it turns out that it is not integrable .",
    "we have to conclude that  strictly speaking  the bose einstein phase transition does not occur in a single - beam optical dipole trap , no matter how cold the gas ; which contradicts findings of recent experiments @xcite .    in order to shed light on this curious result we have to look at the true experimental conditions in more detail .",
    "a solution of this apparent contradiction can be found in gravity  which we neglected up to now . including gravity , the true potential reads @xmath47 as displayed in figure [ figpotential ] , gravity lowers the threshold energy @xmath48 an atom needs to escape the trap in one spatial direction . based on the assumption of sufficient ergodicity",
    ", we simply assume that gravity effectively leads to a cutoff at a certain scaled energy @xmath44 .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath49 depends on the absolute trap depth @xmath11 and on the mass of the atoms .    as a consequence of this cutoff , the integral over the number density in equation ( [ eqkrittemp ] ) extends up to @xmath44 only .",
    "the integral remains finite and bose condensation may take place .",
    "in fact , the critical temperature for a given number of atoms can then well be estimated as usual within the harmonic approximation . to give an example , in an optical dipole trap with @xmath50 ,",
    "the critical temperature for @xmath51 @xmath0-atoms is approximately @xmath52 , which is in accordance with @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that the atoms are trapped so deeply that the harmonic approximation is clearly valid  see figure [ figpotentiale ] .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from figures [ figprodboszust ] : while for fairly high temperatures ( @xmath54 ) the number density in the dipole trap differs from the harmonic approximation over the whole range of energies , this seizes to be true for low temperatures ( @xmath55 ) : here the only difference is the sharp singularity near threshold ( @xmath56 ) which , as we have argued , turns out to be irrelevant due to gravity .",
    "in the last section we came to the conclusion that even though the integral ( [ eqkrittemp ] ) is not integrable in the usual limits , a critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation exists due to gravity or any other interaction that effectively cuts off or blurs the singularity as @xmath46 . the harmonic approximation of the potential is sufficient to determine @xmath57 because temperatures are typically low enough .",
    "however , for processes involving higher temperatures , as for instance evaporation dynamics , the number density @xmath40 in the dipole trap differs significantly from the harmonic one and deviations from the harmonic approximation might become relevant .",
    "evaporative cooling in optical traps is a simple and efficient method for reaching low enough temperatures to produce degenerate bose @xcite and fermi @xcite gases .",
    "the technique is based on the preferential removal of atoms with higher energy than the average energy .",
    "subsequently , the remaining atoms thermalize through elastic collisions , which leads to a lower average energy and temperature .",
    "our discussion here follows @xcite which describes evaporation in a classical approximation .",
    "the latter is justified as typical temperatures are still much higher than the quantum level spacing of an atom in the trap potential . on the other hand",
    "the temperatures shall be low enough to work in the s - wave scattering regime with an energy independent cross section @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the scattering length .",
    "a central ambition is to determine the evolution of the energy distribution of a trapped gas during so - called plain evaporation @xcite .",
    "quite generally , well above the transition temperature , the trapped gas is well described by a classical phase - space distribution @xmath60 , which is normalized according to @xmath61 the time evolution of @xmath60 is determined by the boltzmann equation @xcite @xmath62 with the collision integral @xmath63 for s - wave scattering and thus an energy - independent cross section @xmath64 given by    @xmath65    as in @xcite , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the momenta of two atoms before the collision , @xmath68 and @xmath69 the momenta after the collision . here",

    "@xmath73 denotes the direction of @xmath74 with respect to @xmath75 .",
    "+ the assumption of sufficient ergodicity leads to a phase space distribution as a function of the scaled single - particle energy @xmath30 only , such that it can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath36 is the distribution of atoms as a function of scaled energy @xmath30 which we define to be normalized to one .",
    "the substitution ( [ eqphasespacedistr ] ) leads to a rigorous simplification of the boltzmann equation ( [ eqboltzmann ] ) . after applying @xmath77 to both sides of ( [ eqboltzmann ] ) , the gradient terms on the left - hand side sum to zero , and only a term @xmath78 survives .",
    "the right hand side can also be simplified , as described in @xcite . as a general result , the following kinetic equation for the time evolution of the distribution function @xmath36 ( initially normalized to one ) of a gas in a trap with density of states @xmath79",
    "is obtained :    @xmath80    here , dot denotes time derivative @xmath81 with respect to a dimensionless time @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the initial number of atoms .",
    "recall that @xmath36 is normalized to one initially .",
    "its time evolution is obtained numerically by writing the integral as a sum over a discretized energy scale . in figure [ fignumericplain ]",
    "we show evaporation dynamics for dipole trap ( top ) and for the truncated harmonic potential ( bottom ) .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the number density @xmath40 is shown for the two potentials ; its integral reflects the number of atoms remaining in the trap .",
    "we see from figure [ fignumericplain ] that for all times , @xmath36 can well be approximated by an exponential , i.e. a boltzmann distribution .",
    "apparently , during evaporation the thermal nature of the distribution is preserved . in the case of the dipole trap potential , it is only at the edge of the potential well that @xmath36 differs somewhat from an exponential , due to the singularity in the density of states .",
    "being a boltzmann distribution , the slope of the graphs allows us to extract a temperature of the atoms remaining in the trap .",
    "furthermore , as the graphs in figure [ fignumericplain ] a ) and c ) reveal , the rate of change of @xmath36 for the dipole trap is smaller than for the harmonic potential . the same conclusion can be drawn from parts @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the same figure . as the integral over @xmath40 equals the number of trapped atoms , one finds that the evaporation process in the truncated harmonic trap happens much faster than in the dipole trap .",
    "however , at the end of the evaporation less atoms are left in the dipole trap , while the final temperature is approximately the same .    in order to investigate these observations in more detail",
    ", we calculate the number of atoms remaining in the trap by integrating over the number density @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , we determine the temperature of the remaining atoms by fitting a boltzmann distribution to @xmath36 , as a function of time .",
    "before we discuss these results , however , we want to turn to the semianalytical solutions of equation ( [ eqkineticeq ] ) , which are described in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the replacement of the exact energy distribution function by a truncated boltzmann distribution , which we saw is pretty well justified by looking at figure [ fignumericplain ] ; @xmath86 the heaviside step function ensures that @xmath87 for @xmath88 ; particles with an energy above threshold escape from the trap .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath89 is not a temperature in the strict thermodynamic sense , since evaporation is a nonequilibrium process ; but it surely is a convenient parameter characterizing the essentially nonequilibrium distribution . for the sake of clarity",
    "we introduce the dimensionless `` temperature '' @xmath90 and a scaled total internal energy @xmath91 .",
    "we keep the single - particle energy @xmath30 scaled to @xmath11 as well .",

    "( [ eqevap1 ] ) has to be determined from the normalization condition @xmath99 .",
    "the evaporation of atoms leads to a loss of internal energy of the trapped gas . following the elaborations in @xcite",
    ", we find an evolution equation somewhat similar to ( [ eqevap1 ] ) for the scaled total energy @xmath100 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate of change of the internal energy due to the evaporation of atoms is @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the heat capacity @xmath103 and @xmath104 a chemical potential .",
    "we thus arrive at coupled differential equations which describe the rate of change of temperature , atom number and internal energy during evaporation in closed form .",
    "these can be solved numerically .    using this approximative set of differential equations ,",
    "we want to investigate the evaporation process in the dipole trap based on the true density of states ( [ eqzustandsdichtedipolfalle ] ) and compare with results for the harmonic approximation .",

    "the harmonic approximation may lead to predictions that differ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , we see that in a dipole trap , more atoms get lost eventually compared to the harmonic trap .",
    "the final temperature , on the other hand , turns out to be pretty much the same .    in the case of the dipole trap the truncated boltzmann approximation",
    "does not describe the distribution function @xmath36 accurately over the whole energy range .",
    "clearly , we see deviations for energies near the threshold in figure [ fignumericplain ] . these explain the differences between the numerical and the approximative results for atom number and temperature in figures [ figevapn ] and [ figevapt ] .",
    "we here assume that a bose - einstein condensate has been created in or transferred to a single - beam optical dipole trap . at temperatures well below the critical temperature ,",
    "the condensate wave function is well described by the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath105 with @xmath106 the chemical potential .",
    "often , the so - called thomas - fermi approximation may be employed @xcite which describes the bec in the limit of large atom numbers such that the contribution of the kinetic energy may be neglected with respect to the internal energy and the potential energy .",
    "the condensate wave function is then given by the simple formula @xmath107 valid for all positions @xmath108 such that the right hand side is positive , and @xmath109 otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath110 describes the strength of the atom - atom interaction and is connected to the s - wave scattering length @xmath59 through @xmath111 . for a harmonic approximation , the thomas - fermi wave function ( [ eqthomas - fermi ] ) leads to the analytical expression @xmath112 for the chemical potential , where @xmath106 is normalized to @xmath11 and positive ( similar to @xmath30 ) .",
    "remarkably , in thomas - fermi approximation , even the full dipole potential ( [ eqdipolpot ] ) allows for an analytical treatment . by integrating expression ( [ eqthomas - fermi ] ) over @xmath108 and equating it with the total atom number @xmath37 we find the simple expression @xmath113 similar to the density of states ( [ eqzustandsdichtedipolfalle ] ) , the number of particles @xmath37 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath106 develops a singularity at @xmath114 in the dipole trap .",
    "clearly , in the harmonic trap the particle number for any @xmath106 remains finite . for small condensate numbers",
    "@xmath37 the chemical potentials agree , as shown in figure [ figchempottf ] .",
    "furthermore , we found an analytical expression for the internal ( interaction ) energy in thomas - fermi approximation for a condensate . by integrating the squared expression ( [ eqthomas - fermi ] ) , one finds for the harmonic approximation the well - known @xmath115 , while for the dipole trap the result can only be given analytically as a function of the chemical potential : @xmath116 clearly , the internal energy remains finite for any finite number of atoms .    finally , we determine the thomas - fermi radii of the condensate in such an optical dipole trap .",

    "both expressions diverge for @xmath122 . in figure [ figtfradiusztf ]",
    "we show @xmath123 for both traps .        it should be emphasized that temperatures and atom numbers that may be achieved with evaporative cooling as described in the first part of this paper lead to `` small '' condensates that may well be described with the harmonic approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it is conceivable that much larger condensates are created in some other trap before being loaded into a single - beam optical dipole trap such that deviations from the harmonic trap become relevant and our results apply .",
    "we found an analytical expression for the density of states of an optical dipole trap potential , consisting of one single focused laser beam .",
    "the density of states has a singularity at the potential edge of the trap .    without further consideration ,",
    "this singularity would prevent bose - einstein condensation from occurring . however , since an effective cutoff will be present in current - day experiments ( e.g. due to gravity ) , condensation can be achieved .",
    "then , near condensation , the usual harmonic approximation is valid and may be used to determine , e.g. , the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation .    still , the existence of this singularity makes itself felt whenever states of higher energy are involved as , for instance , in evaporative cooling .",
    "we found that plain evaporative cooling is much slower ( about one order of magnitude ) in the dipole trap compared to its harmonic approximation .",
    "in addition , for the optical dipole trap more atoms get lost on the way to the same temperature compared to the harmonic trap .    finally , we determine analytical expressions for chemical potential , internal energy and thomas - fermi radii for the true optical dipole trap in thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "it turns out that the chemical potential and the radii of the condensate develop singularities similar to the density of states .",
    "while we here concentrate on bosonic gases , it will be interesting to see how the semiclassical expression ( [ eqzustandsdichtedipolfalle ] ) will be of relevance for the behavior of fermionic gases in single - beam dipole traps .",
