    "first passage percolation was introduced by hammersley and welsh @xcite to model the flow of a fluid in a randomly porous material ( see @xcite for a recent account on the subject ) .",
    "we will consider the following model of first passage percolation in @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the set of edges in @xmath0 .",
    "the passage time of the fluid through the edge @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 and is supposed to be nonnegative .",
    "randomness of the porosity is given by a product probability measure on @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is equipped with the measure @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a probability measure on @xmath8 according to which each passage time is distributed , independently from the others . if @xmath9 are two vertices of @xmath0 , the notation @xmath10 means that @xmath11 is a path with end points @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the first passage time , or equivalently the distance from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the metric induced by @xmath16 , @xmath17 the study of @xmath18 when @xmath19 is an integer which goes to infinity is of central importance .",
    "kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem implies the existence , for each fixed @xmath12 , of a `` time constant '' @xmath20 such that : @xmath21{\\nu - a.s } t(u)\\;.\\ ] ] it is known ( see kesten @xcite , p.127 and 129 ) that if @xmath22 is strictly smaller than the critical probability for bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath0 , then @xmath20 is positive for every @xmath12 distinct from the origin .",
    "under such an assumption , one can say that the random variable @xmath18 is located around @xmath23 , which is of order @xmath24 , where we denote by @xmath25 the @xmath26-norm of vertices in @xmath0 . in this paper , we are interested in the fluctuations of this quantity . precisely , we define , for any vertex @xmath13 , @xmath27 it is widely believed that the fluctuations of @xmath28 are of order @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "apart from some predictions made by physicists , this faith relies on recent results for related growth models @xcite .",
    "until recently , the best results rigourously obtained for the fluctuations of @xmath28 were some moderate deviation estimates of order @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) . in 1993",
    ", kesten @xcite proved that , @xmath32 provided @xmath7 admits a finite second order moment .",
    "if , furthermore , @xmath7 admits a finite moment of exponential order , there exist two constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that for any @xmath35 , @xmath36 later , talagrand improved the right - hand side of the above inequality to @xmath37 . in 2003 ,",
    "benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite proved that for bernoulli edge times bounded away from 0 , the variance of @xmath28 is of order @xmath38 , and therefore , the fluctuations are of order @xmath39 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the work of benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite can be extended to other distributions , notably continuous distributions which are not bounded away from zero .",
    "this has been done in a preliminary version of the present paper @xcite by extending the tools of @xcite , namely a modified poincar inequality due to talagrand .",
    "it is also natural , and even more desirable , to try to improve the result of benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite into an exponential inequality in the spirit of ( [ ineqkestenexpo ] ) , with @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 . in this article",
    "we show that some different modified poincar inequalities arising from the context of `` threshold phenomena '' for boolean functions ( see @xcite ) may be used successfully instead of talagrand - type inequalities from @xcite .",
    "this is the main result of this paper , stated in theorem [ theofppexpo ] . whereas we focused on the percolation setting ,",
    "the argument is fairly general and we present also an abstract exponential concentration result , theorem [ thmconcentrationgenerale ] , which is very likely to have applications outside the setting of percolation .    this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : logsobfkbis ] , we extend the modified poincar inequalities of falik and samorodnitsky @xcite to non - bernoulli and countable settings where logarithmic sobolev inequalities are available , notably to a countable product of gaussian measures .",
    "section [ sec : extension ] is devoted to the obtention of similar inequalities for other continuous measures by a simple mean of change of variable . in section [ sec : concentration ] , we show how to deduce new general exponential concentration bounds from the modified poincar inequalities of section [ sec : logsobfkbis ] .",
    "this allows us to obtain in section [ sec : fpp ] an exponential version of the bound of benjamini et al . in some continuous and discrete settings .",

    "the relevance of a `` modified poincar inequality '' due to talagrand @xcite in the context of first passage percolation was shown by benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite .",
    "let us explain this point a little bit more .",
    "a classical poincar inequality has the following form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant , and @xmath66 is an `` energy '' of @xmath43 , that is , usually , the mean against @xmath53 of the square of some kind of gradient . there is a good theory for this in the context of markov semi - groups ( see @xcite for instance ) . by `` modified poincar inequality '' ,",
    "we mean a functional inequality which improves upon the classical poincar inequality for a certain class of functions @xmath43 .",
    "this is usually achieved through a hypercontrativity property ( see @xcite and ledoux @xcite ) .    in this section",
    ", we will show how to build a modified poincar inequality on a product of probability spaces each of which satisfies a sobolev logarithmic inequality .",
    "this approach was initiated independently by rossignol @xcite , falik and samorodnitsky @xcite in the bernoulli setting .",

    "then , the commutation property tells us that @xmath129 belongs to @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the first part of proposition [ proppoincaremod ] , the one that we just proved : @xmath132 this may be written as : @xmath133 obviously , @xmath134 .",
