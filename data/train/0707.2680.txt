    "the x - ray observatories _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have made possibile focusing on the x - ray extended emission from the faintest x - ray components of a radio galaxy , the lobes .",
    "the first aim has been to define the origin of the x - ray emission : thermal , due to external gas , compressed by the expansion of the lobes @xcite , or non - thermal , due to inverse compton ( ic ) by relativistic electrons with @xmath2 on cmb photons @xcite . in the last case",
    ", we can use x - ray fluxes together with radio fluxes to obtain a direct estimate of the average magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) along the line of side and , independently , the number densities of the ic emitting particles in the lobes .",
    "this method has allowed to go beyond and , at the same time , to check the validity of the classical assumption of the minimum energy condition ( equipartition ) in the extended regions . even though the subject is still highly debated @xcite",
    ", however it seems reasonable to conclude that the equipartition argument represents a viable zero - order reference guide .",
    "also the study of the variations of the magnetic field and particle densities turns out to be useful to acquire informations on the dynamical plasma evolution in the lobes .",
    "even though this procedure has been applied only to a few radio galaxies because of observational limits , the results indicate an enhancement of the magnetic energy density towards the edge of the lobes @xcite .",
    "here we present a study of the lobes of the radio galaxy pictor a , based on a new _ xmm - newton _ observation of 50 ksec .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission was exhaustively discussed in some previous papers @xcite , and in @xcite we reported the preliminary spectral analysis from this last 50 ksec observation , conducted on two datasets accumulated on the east and west lobe regions ( respectively e and w regions hereafter ) . the extended x - ray emission is confirmed to be due to non - thermal processes , i.e. ic on cmb photons ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] and tab .",
    "[ tab_1 ] for a recap of the spectral analysis ) .",
    "the originality of the work on this new observation rather resides in the possibility of realize a spatially resolved study of the lobes , investigating the possible variations of the physical conditions inside the lobes themselves .",
    "for this reason we accumulated epic / mos1 data sets from selected rectangular regions , three for each lobe , labeled as described in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] . since the low number of counts",
    ", we obtained x - ray fluxes , @xmath3 , for each subregion , once fixed the x - ray spectral slope , @xmath4 , referring to the value , @xmath5 , found for the spectra of the e and w regions .",
    "combining the x - ray fluxes at 1 kev , @xmath6 , with the corrispondent radio fluxes , @xmath7 , derived at 20 cm from the vla image produced by @xcite , the magnetic field @xmath0 can be immediately estimated from the formula : @xmath8^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}[\\frac{\\nu_{syn}}{\\nu_{ic}}]^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+1}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are quantities depending only from @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 x - ray and radio spectral indeces , and @xmath14 is the volume , @xmath15 being the area ( arcsec@xmath16 ) projected on the sky plane and @xmath17 the thickness of the analyzed region . from synchrotron radio and compton scattered x - ray luminosities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also the other physical quantities , i.e. the electron density , @xmath18 , magnetic field and particle energy densities , respectively @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are calculated .",
    "the results are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab_2 ] together with the values found for the e and w regions , corresponding to the average physical conditions in the two lobes .",
    "+ the two lobes ( e and w regions ) show very similar physical conditions , both for the magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) and the particle density @xmath18 . in particular , from the ratio @xmath22",
    ", it emerges that the energetic of the lobes appears to be dominated by the particles , hinting at a possible departure from the equipartition principle . using the equipartition formula revised by @xcite",
    ", we calculated the equipartition magnetic fields , @xmath1 , for both the two lobes .",
    "we found that @xmath1 overestimates @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "the equipartition estimate depends on some poorly known physical parameters such as the minimum energy of the relativistic electrons and the proton to electron energy ratio .",
    "however in @xcite we have shown that our conclusion are not changed even by allowing these parameters to vary within a viable physical range .",
    "interesting results derive from the spatially resolved analysis in spite of quite large uncertainties .",
    "in fact , if no change in the electron density appears evident in the different subregions of the two lobes , on the other side , tab .  [ tab_2 ]",
    "gives an indication that @xmath0 increases behind the east hot spot ( e2 region in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) where the radio flux is higher .",
    "a variation of the magnetic field was also considered in the model proposed by @xcite . when the data from both lobes are combined together",
    ", the previous results are strengthen . plotting @xmath0 and @xmath18 as a function of the radio flux ( divided for the corresponding sub - region volume ) , like in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we find a statistically significant variation of @xmath0 ( @xmath24 with a probability @xmath25 ) .",
    "a _ spearman test _ gives a correlation coefficient @xmath26 with a @xmath27 significance : @xmath0 seems to trace the variation of the radio flux density .",
    "once again , this behaviour is not reflected in the @xmath18 trend ( fig  [ fig_2 ] , _ upper panel _ ) , and the correlation test gives @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "+ the possibility of variation of the spectrum of emitting electrons through the lobes is a critical issue as these variations may force @xmath0  - radio trends .",
    "anyway , an analysis of the spectral index radio maps between 20 and 6 cm and between 6 and 2 cm ( kindly provided by r. perley and shown in fig .",
    "5 of perley et al .",
    "1997 ) shows negligible spectral index variations ( @xmath30 ) from a sub - region to another one , confirming the robustness of our result .",
    "+ the resulting picture might indicate a dynamical decoupling between the magnetic field and the electron energy densities as found in 3c452 by isobe et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "a possibility is that plasma and high energy electrons expand on different scales : the first in the regions immediately beyond the hot spots , while the second on larger scales giving a fairly constant density distribution .",
    "this is in line with the picture , of a decreasing magnetic field with the increasing distance from the hot spots , proposed by @xcite to explain the discrepancy between the radiative lifetimes of electrons and dynamical ages of double radio galaxies .",
    "the presence of a spatial gradient of the magnetic field was also suggested by @xcite to justify the lack of spectral aging in the case of the lobes of 3c 234 .",
