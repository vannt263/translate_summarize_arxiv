    "the zero modes due to this phenomenon are localized , concentrated around the domain wall , and chiral from the point of view of the domain - wall world - volume ( a @xmath3-dimensional theory ) .",
    "this mechanism has found many interesting applications , both to phenomenological issues  @xcite and theoretical elaborations  @xcite .",
    "dynamical domain walls have been considered in  @xcite and the very interesting case of a dynamical supersymmetric model with this kind of configuration has been discussed in  @xcite . remarkably , lattice versions of the zero modes , the so - called ` domain wall fermions '  @xcite have also been precursors of the overlap dirac operator  @xcite , a sensible way to put chiral fermions on a spacetime lattice .    in spite of the fact that the callan - harvey mechanism has been extended in many directions ,",
    "the existence of chiral zero modes has been so far only studied for the case of local mass terms , namely , those where the mass is a local function of the spacetime coordinates .    in this article",
    ", we consider a different generalization of the problem , namely , the case of a non local mass in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "this is a non trivial modification of the usual assumptions of the callan - harvey mechanism , which does , however , arise naturally in some applications : we show that explicitly for a case where the fields are dynamical , and radiative corrections are included .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ sec : generalization ] we set up the general framework , defining the class of systems we shall consider , in terms of an associated non - homogeneous integral equation for the zero mode . in section [ sec : physmodel ] , a concrete realization of the kind of non local mass discussed earlier is exhibited , evaluating its zero mode solutions .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",

    "@xmath14 we can construct the hermitian operator @xmath15 .",
    "the form of @xmath16 suggests the introduction of the adjoint operators @xmath17 in terms of which @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "expanding @xmath22 in the complete set of eigenfunctions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , there appears  @xcite a massless left fermion , localized over the domain wall .",
    "its @xmath25 dependence is dictated by the fact that it is a zero mode of the @xmath26 operator , and it dominates the low energy dynamics of the system .",
    "we want to generalize this phenomenon to include a non local mass ( in the following section we present a model that motivates this generalization ) .",
    "namely , rather than ( [ eq : defdirac1 ] ) , the dirac operator shall be @xmath27 little can be said about the existence of a fermionic zero mode before we make some hypotheses to restrict the form of @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the system has translation invariance in the coordinates @xmath29 and that @xmath28 consists of a local domain wall like part , plus a non local term with a strength controlled by a parameter @xmath30 : @xmath31    we are looking for a zero mode @xmath32 , so that : @xmath33 taking advantage of the translation invariance in @xmath34 , we use ` separation of variables ' to look for solutions of the form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a massless spinor , which is left - handed from the point of view of the two - dimensional world defined by @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 there is an essential difference regarding the space of solutions to the equations above in euclidean and minkowski spacetimes .",
    "indeed , in euclidean spacetime , it leads to analytic functions of @xmath39 , while in the minkowski case one has ` left - mover ' solutions . keeping this distinction in mind",
    ", we continue working with the euclidean version .    substituting ( [ eq : defpsi1 ] ) into ( [ eq : defzeromode1 ] ) and comparing with ( [ eq : dirac1.1 ] ) , we arrive to a non local version of the kernel for the annihilation operator @xmath40",

    "indeed , introducing linear operators , ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 we see that the problem can be discussed in terms of ( [ eq : fredholm2 ] ) , which is an inhomogeneous system of the fredholm type  @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath56 has to be verified , of course , after solving ( [ eq : fredholm2 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this procedure is that , had we used the original homogeneous system , we should have had to introduce non compact operators , and the theory for this kind of operator is substantianlly poorer than for the compact case .",
    "we have shown that the physical restrictions imposed on the non local mass lead us to integral equations of the fredholm type .",
    "the existence and properties of solutions of these kinds of equations are very well known  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the theorem of the fredholm alternative provides information that is useful to our purposes .",
    "the fredholm alternative  @xcite states that if @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a compact operator on a hilbert space @xmath60 , then the following alternative holds :    * either @xmath61 has only the trivial solution , in which case @xmath62 has a unique solution @xmath63 * or @xmath61 has @xmath64 linearly independent solutions @xmath65",
    ". then @xmath66 also has @xmath64 linearly independent solutions @xmath67 . in this case",
    "@xmath68 is solvable iff @xmath69 .",
    "+ in the second alternative , the general non - homogeneous solution is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a particular solution and @xmath72 are arbitrary constants .",
    "note that , when the first alternative holds true , it implies in particular that the solution will be unique when @xmath57 is replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "solutions corresponding to @xmath74 are not solutions of the system : , , equivalent to the original homogeneous equation ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) , and may , therefore , be discarded .",
    "any true solution of the system will also verify a subsidiary equation , obtained by setting @xmath75 in ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) : @xmath76 for any @xmath77 .",
    "this equation shall be true whenever the equations @xmath78 , @xmath56 are both true ( since it is derived from them ) , and any solution will automatically verify it .    in our case , we want to study the effect of the non local term , the strength of which is controlled by the value of @xmath30 .",
    "close enough to the local mass case , @xmath30 can be made arbitrarily small , so @xmath79 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath59 and consequently @xmath80 has only the trivial solution .",
    "therefore , if @xmath59 is a fredholm operator , ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) will have a unique solution .",
    "the functional space @xmath60 to which @xmath81 belongs is restricted by the condition @xmath82 because @xmath22 itself has to be normalizable .",
    "this becomes a hilbert space , and it contains the zero mode of the local operator ( @xmath83 ) , when the scalar product used in @xmath60 is the one defined by ( [ eq : hcond ] ) , namely , @xmath84^ * \\ , g(x_2 ) \\;.\\ ] ]    of course , things may be different if @xmath60 were equipped with the standard @xmath85 scalar product , since then a constant function would not have a finite norm , although it would verify ( [ eq : hcond ] ) .",
    "we assume that the norm defined by ( [ eq : defscalar ] ) is used in what follows .    when all the fredholm s hypotheses are satisfied for a general kernel @xmath86 , it is possible to find a perturbative solution . indeed ,",
    "writing @xmath87 and successively replacing @xmath88 by @xmath89 on the right hand side , we obtain the neumann series  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 it can be shown  @xcite that the neumann series converges uniformly to the solution @xmath81 when @xmath93 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] so choosing @xmath30 to satisfy ( [ eq : radiusconv ] ) , we are allowed to represent @xmath94 by the expansion @xmath95    in subsection  [ subsec : quantumcorr ] we shall use another method to find a solution , which is useful when the kernel is separable  @xcite . since this condition may be satisfied by an operator which is not of the fredholm type , it allows us to explore rather different situations .",
    "after the previous general analysis , we now consider the effects of quantum corrections for a specific choice of both the local and non local parts of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : defnonlocalmass ] ) .",
    "a natural generalization of the purely local mass case is to have and a @xmath96 which is ` strongly diagonal ' and symmetric in @xmath97 , i.e. : @xmath98\\delta_n ( x_2-y_2 ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is an approximation of dirac s delta : @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath102 when @xmath101 , so that the non local term reduces to a local domain wall mass .",
    "we then adopt ` natural ' units such that @xmath103 , and study the particular case @xmath104 .",
    "regarding @xmath99 , we use a truncation of the one - dimensional completeness relation : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a complete set of functions .",
    "we chose @xmath107 to be the harmonic oscillator s eigenfunctions .",
