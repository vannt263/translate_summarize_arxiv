    "a black hole accretion disk system is one of the most energetic phenomena in the universe . a mass accretion onto the black holes results in effective release of gravitational energy .",
    "according to the mass accretion rate , three accretion modes , i.e. , standard disk model , radiatively inefficient accretion flow model , and slim disk model have been proposed by , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * for a review ) . whereas above three models are established by one - dimensional approach , multi - dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations of the accretion disks have been performed . in mhd simulations ,",
    "the phenomenological viscosity model is not used , since the disk viscosity is magnetic origin , i.e. , magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "however , the radiation transfer should be solved in order to investigate the luminous accretion modes .    by 2.5-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) simulations ,",
    "@xcite for the fist time succeeded in reproducing three accretion modes by one numerical code ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "they revealed that the super - critical accretion , of which the mass accretion rate is over the critical rate ( @xmath7 ) , shines at the super - eddington luminosity , where @xmath8 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath4 is the light speed . in this case , since the huge amount of photons is mainly released towards the rotation axis of the disks , the radiation force does not prevent the mass accretion along the disk plane @xcite . from the surface of the super - critical accretion disks , powerful jets or outflows",
    "are launched by the strong radiation force .",
    "@xcite showed that the jets are accelerated by the radiation force and collimated by the lorentz force .",
    "this type of jet seems to explain mildly relativistic , powerful jet from the microquasar , ss 433 .",
    "however , their simulations are not fully taken account of the relativistic effect , though the maximum velocity of the jet is several @xmath9 of the light speed .    the highly relativistic jets , of which the velocity is close to the light speed , are thought to associate with the black hole accretion flows ; e.g. , microquasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , active galactic nuclei , and gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the relativistic effects should play important roles for such highly relativistic flows .",
    "for instance , the radiation drag force decelerates the outflows in contrast with the acceleration via the radiation flux force .",
    "thus , for a non - relativistic approach , the outflow velocity should be overestimated .",
    "the relativistic rmhd simulations are required to study the radiatively - driven high - velocity outflows .",
    "recently , special relativistic ( sr ) @xcite and general relativistic ( gr ) rmhd code has been developed , and gr - rmhd simulation of the super - critical disks are initiated @xcite .    in this paper , we perform 2.5-dimensional sr - rmhd simulation of the super - critical accretion disks and launching outflows . for the outflows ,",
    "we investigate the deceleration via the radiation drag as well as the the acceleration via the radiation flux force .",

    "we have to note that our simulation has been performed in 2-dimension by assuming axisymmetry , so that the anti - dynamo effect works and the magnetic field can not be maintained @xcite .",
    "so as to avoid this problem , we inject the gas which has the poloidal magnetic field , realizing a steady accretion in the present work ( see , section [ sec : overview ] ) .",
    "our procedure would not be unnatural , since the magnetized matter is thought to be transported from outer region to the disks in reality .",
    "also , the phenomenological dynamo model is employed to amplify the magnetic fields in some of 2-dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "the 3-dimensional simulations , in which the anti - dynamo does not work , are performed by @xcite .",
    "the impact of our boundary condition on the resulting accretion flow structure should be verified by comparing results between these different models .",
    "after simulation starts , a gas is injected in the torus . since the injected gas is not in dynamically equilibrium and since a gas pressure is larger in the torus than in the corona , the injected gas expands by the gas pressure gradient force at once .",

    "such an expansion behavior is remarkable only at the elapse time of @xmath92 s. after a few second , a mhd turbulence develops and gas starts to accrete onto the black hole .",

    "after that , the gas is continuously swallowed by the black hole at the super - critical rate , @xmath94 .",
    "then , the radiation energy is enhanced in the accretion disks since a part of the gas internal energy is converted through the free - free emission .",
    "the strong radiation force drives the outflows from the disks . at that time , since the torus is embedded in the dense matter , the expansion behavior does not occur .",

    "this disk is supported by the strong radiation pressure .",
    "indeed , it is found that the radiation energy density is enhanced in the disk .",
    "since the disk is very optically thick for the electron scattering , most of the radiation energy is trapped inside the accretion disks .",
    "in contrast of @xmath106 in the disk , the radiation energy is effectively transported above the disk ( @xmath107 ) due to small density ( small optical depth ) .",
    "especially , we find @xmath108 around the rotation axis , meaning that the photons freely move in vertical direction .",
    "then , the radiation flux force effectively accelerates the gas , leading to the outflows .",
    "such an outflowing motion is clearly shown in the right panel ( see velocity vectors above the disk ) .",

    "width=302 ]    after @xmath126 sec . , we find that the mass accretion rate onto the black hole is about @xmath127 and slowly increases with time .",
    "due to the release of the gravitational energy via the mass accretion , the radiation energy is enhanced , driving the outflow from the accretion disk .",
    "the outflow carries a large amount of gas at the rate of @xmath128 a few 10% of the mass accretion rate , which exceeds the critical rate ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the kinetic power and the photon luminosity are almost comparable to the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath129 . in addition , we find @xmath115 and @xmath114 are much smaller than @xmath117 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "this means that most of kinetic and radiation energies are swallowed by the black hole .",
    "since the huge amount of photons is swallowed by the black hole with accreting gas ( photon trapping ) , the photon luminosity is not sensitive to the mass accretion rate @xcite .",

    "the total mass within the computational domain decreases with time . in our simulations ,",
    "the gas is injected at constant rate .",
    "the total mass in the simulation box and the mass accretion rate onto the black hole increases with time .",
    "however , the disk is actually in steady state which is understood in figure[fig : fig4 ] . in this figure",

    "this indicates that the inflow equilibrium is attained , while the mass flow rate slowly increases with time .",
    "thus , the results obtained by our simulation are not transient behavior but the quasi - steady structure for various mass accretion rate , @xmath137 .",
    "also , @xcite showed that the mechanical energy weakly increases with @xmath137 , while it is almost independent of it in our results .",
    "such a discrepancy might be due to the general relativistic effects and/or @xmath137 . in @xcite ,",

    "it is clearly seen in a bottom panel of figure [ fig : fig8 ] . in this panel , we plot @xmath246 ( orange ) , @xmath240 ( red ) , @xmath241 ( blue ) , and @xmath242 ( green ) at @xmath157 .",
    "the radiation drag force dominates over the radiation flux force and the relativistic correction except at @xmath247 , where the inward ( @xmath244 direction ) radiation flux force is dominant .",
    "hence , the expansion of the outflow is prevented by the radiation drag at @xmath245 .",
    "we conclude that the radiation drag force has important roles for determining both the velocity and the opening angle of the outflow .",
    "we performed 2.5-dimensional special relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the super - critical accretion disks and the radiatively driven outflows .",
    "we found that the outflow is accelerated by the radiation flux force and is subjected to the radiation drag force , which prevents the outflow from speeding up .",
    "the outflow velocity is determined by force balance between above two forces and becomes @xmath0 of the light speed near the rotation axis .",
    "such a velocity does not change so much in the super - critical accretion regime of @xmath248 .",
    "such a faster outflow is surrounded by a slower outflow , of which the velocity is @xmath249 .",
    "it is similar with so - called spine - sheath structure .",
    "it is found that the radiation drag force works to collimate the slower outflow in cooperation with the lorentz force , though the faster outflow is mainly collimated by the lorentz force .",
    "the most of kinetic energy is carried by the slower outflow , and the radiation energy is larger in the slower outflow than in the faster outflow .",
    "although the mass accretion rate onto the black hole largely exceeds the critical rate ( @xmath3 ) , the total photon and kinematic luminosities are comparable to @xmath250 , since a huge amount of the radiation energy is trapped and swallowed by the black hole with accreting matter .",
    "the swallowed photon luminosity is roughly proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "the resulting outflow velocity of @xmath251 nicely agrees with the jets ( @xmath252 ) observed in ss 433 @xcite .",
    "however , it is inconsistent with the highly relativistic jets in grs 1915 + 195 @xcite , or some active galactic nuclei",
    ". the outflow velocity might increase if the slower outflow is optically thick .",
    "this is because the outflow is self - shielded and the spine of the outflow can avoid suffering from the radiation drag .",
    "in addition , if the photon bubble instability occurs near the innermost regions of the accretion disks , the outward radiation flux increases , going up the outflow velocity due to the enhanced radiation flux force @xcite . on the other hand , the outflow velocity does not increase even if the pair - plasma appears in the outflow , since the radiation drag acts on the positron as well as the electron .",
    "we included only opacities due to the electron scattering and free - free absorption .",
    "recently , @xcite performed non - relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations including thermal comptonization .",
    "they showed that although the compton effect does not impact on the disk structure so much , the gas temperature of the outflow drastically decreases due to the compton up - scattering .",
    "decreasing of the gas temperature leads to softening of x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "we need to include the comptonization in relativistic radiation mhd simulation @xcite to explain the spectral properties observed in microquasars .",
    "although we assume the axisymmetry in the present study , three - dimensional study is required in order to estimate the outflow velocity more precisely .",
    "if the density of the disk fluctuates in azimuthal direction , the photon trapping effect might degrade since the photon can escape from the less dense region .",
    "then , the radiation fields change and the outflow velocity alters .",
    "the dynamo would change the evolution of the magnetic fields , leading to the change of the disk structure .",
    "the saturation velocity in such a case might be differ from that of the present study .",
    "the 3-dimensional simulation has been initiated in the newtonian limit @xcite and in general relativity @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed 3-dimensional simulation of slim disks by solving full radiation transfer equation keeping terms of @xmath253 .",
    "they found that the outflow velocity is about 0.3 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "comparing results in detail between these different models is also very important future work to understand the validity of the closure relation .",
    "the light bending should decrease the photon luminosity , since more photons are swallowed by the black hole .",
    "then , the kinetic luminosity of the outflow would go down .",
    "in contrast , the spin of the black hole is though to enhance the outflow ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "recently , gr simulations have been revealed that the strong outflow is generated from the super - critical accretion disks around kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the difference between our simulations and previous non - relativistic simulations .",
    "@xcite performed non - relativistic radiation mhd simulation with the flux - limited diffusion approximation ( fld , @xcite ) , reporting that the outflow velocity is about @xmath254 , which is faster than our results ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "such a difference would be caused by the radiation drag effect , which is not taken into account in @xcite .",
    "thus , we stress that it is important to include the radiation drag effects to study acceleration mechanisms of outflows from black hole accretion disks .",
    "the different algorithms make differences especially in the outflow regions , since the approximate radiative transfer algorithms ( e.g. , fld approximation , the eddington approximation , and the m-1 method ) are known to be problematic in the optically thin region and , in contrast , give accurate radiation fields in the optically thick diffusion limit .",
    "the fld approximation can not be properly applied to the relativistic fluid since it violates a causality ( e.g. , the radiation energy equation becomes parabolic ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the eddington approximation is utilizable in relativistic simulations . in the relativistic one - dimensional test problems",
    ", @xcite showed that @xmath256 becomes larger for the m-1 treatment than for the eddington approximation .",
    "thus , it is expected that the terminal velocity becomes slower if the eddington approximation is adopted .",
    "however , the performing simulation with the eddington approximation is time - consuming since @xmath257 matrix inversion at each grid point is needed to compute eddington tensor .",
    "hence , the detailed comparison between eddington approximation and m-1 closure is beyond the scope of the present paper and is left as an important future work .",
    "in addition , recently , a more accurate method , which solves radiative transfer equation , has been proposed by @xcite . comparing results between these different models is also very important future work to understand the validity of the closure relation .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for improving our manuscript .",
