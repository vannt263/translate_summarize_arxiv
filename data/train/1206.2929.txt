    "recent years have seen a surge of interest in light dark matter candidates .",
    "while such particles are not conventionally found in many of the most popular models ( such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model , for example ) , a number of reported observations have been interpreted as possible indirect and direct signals of dark matter particles with a mass of approximately 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "these signals include the spectrum and angular distribution of gamma - rays from the galactic center as observed by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope  @xcite , provides a good fit to the observed gamma - ray signal and is in good agreement with expectations from state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite . ] the synchrotron emission from the milky way s radio filaments  @xcite , and the diffuse synchrotron emission from the inner galaxy  @xcite ( known as the `` wmap haze ''  @xcite , whose presence has recently been confirmed by the planck collaboration  @xcite ) .",
    "observations reported from the direct detection experiments dama / libra  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , and cresst - ii  @xcite have also each been shown to possibly originate from the elastic scattering of approximately 10 gev dark matter particles  @xcite . and while a number of null results have been presented as a challenge to this direct detection evidence  @xcite ( see also , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it has become clear that the breadth of possibilities for light wimps is much larger than previously appreciated .",
    "if dark matter particles are in fact responsible for this collection ( or any subset of this collection ) of direct and indirect signals , they must possess a number of rather specific properties .",
    "in particular , in order to explain all of these observations with a single species of dark matter particles ( with a mass of approximately 10 gev ) , the following requirements must be satisfied :    * to accommodate the shape of the gamma - ray spectrum observed from the galactic center  @xcite , dark matter annihilations must not proceed primarily to quarks , but to final states such as @xmath6 .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum tentatively reported from the virgo cluster also possesses similar features  @xcite .",
    "we will show later in this article that dark matter annihilations to mesons ( including neutral pions ) or to @xmath7 can also provide a good fit to the measured spectrum . * to produce the distinctive spectrum of synchrotron emission that is observed from the milky way s non - thermal radio filaments  @xcite",
    ", dark matter annihilations must inject an extremely hard spectrum of electrons ( sometimes described in the radio literature as `` monoenergetic ''  ) .",
    "dark matter which annihilates to @xmath8 a significant fraction of the time can accommodate both the observed characteristics of the radio filaments , as well as the wmap / planck haze  @xcite , and could also potentially account for much of the excess isotropic radio background  @xcite . * the total cross section required to normalize the annihilation rate to the observed gamma - ray and radio fluxes is approximately @xmath4@xmath9 @xmath10/s , although uncertainties in the dark matter distribution make the extraction of this quantity uncertain at the level of a factor of a few .",
    "this value is strikingly similar to that required to thermally produce the measured abundance of dark matter in the early universe ( @xmath11 @xmath10/s ) . *",
    "the spectra and time variation of events reported by the dama / libra , cogent and cresst - ii collaborations collectively favor a spin - independent elastic scattering cross section between dark matter and nucleons on the order of @xmath12 @xmath13 ( assuming equal couplings to protons and neutrons )  @xcite .    and while some of the features listed above are not found among many of the most popular dark matter candidates ( such as neutralinos ) , various models satisfying these requirements have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest scenario considered thus far is one in which the dark matter annihilates to the desired charged lepton final states through the exchange of a new gauge boson with much larger couplings to leptons than to quarks .",
    "such a leptophilic gauge boson could arise from the addition of a new gauge group , such as the anomaly free @xmath14 , for example .",
    "any gauge boson that couples to electrons ( as required to generate the synchrotron spectrum observed from radio filaments ) , however , must contend with the rather stringent constraints from lep ii .",
    "in particular , in order for the dark matter to annihilate through the exchange of a leptophilic gauge boson at a rate high enough to avoid being overproduced in the early universe while also avoiding the constraints from lep ii requires either that the gauge boson couples much more strongly to the dark matter than to electrons , or that the mass of the gauge boson lies near the resonance @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the mass of the dark matter candidate  @xcite . and while either of these possibilities represent viable options from a model building standpoint , neither are what one might have naively expected nature to provide .    in this article",
    ", we consider an alternative class of dark matter models capable of explaining the indirect and direct signals described above .",
    "again , we consider a new gauge boson , but with a mass lighter than that of the dark matter itself , @xmath17 .",
    "if the gauge group responsible for this new gauge boson is charged only to the dark matter , such as @xmath18 , then dark matter annihilations will produce pairs of the new boson , which then decay through kinetic mixing with the photon to standard model states . as we will show , for very plausible values of the gauge coupling ( @xmath19 ) , gauge boson mass ( @xmath20 100 mev- 3 gev ) , and degree of kinetic mixing ( @xmath21 ) , the dark matter in this model can account for the observed gamma - ray and synchrotron spectra , as well as the anomalous direct direction signals .",
    "dark matter interacting through dark forces has been widely discussed in recent years , especially within the context of efforts to provide an explanation for the pamela positron excess @xcite .",
    "the idea that dark matter might be charged under a @xmath22 that kinetically mixes with the photon was first considered by holdom nearly three decades ago  @xcite .",
    "models in which the dark matter could freeze - out by annihilations into a light metastable dark force carrier were considered much more recently by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who noted that high energy @xmath23 final states were a natural consequence of this channel .",
    "such signals were subsequently studied in ref .",
    "such models were studied in general in ref .",
    "@xcite , which examined both heavy wimps as well as the possibility of @xmath4mev mass wimps to explain the 511 kev line observed by integral .    within the context of light wimps , refs .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a @xmath4gev mass @xmath22 gauge boson which kinetically mixes with electromagnetism could lead to a large elastic scattering cross section between dark matter and nuclei . and",
    "while the leptonic phenomenology ( i.e. , pamela ) has been well explored for dark forces in the case of heavy wimps , the indirect signals for the slightly heavier @xmath1 ( with associated hadronic cascades ) have not been as thoroughly studied .",
    "moreover , within the context of light wimps , and specifically with connections to observations of the galactic center , the associated gamma - ray phenomenology has not previously been explored .",
    "this simple model we consider in this article consists of a stable dirac fermion , @xmath0 , which will serve as our dark matter candidate , and a new @xmath18 gauge group , broken to provide a massive vector boson , @xmath1 .",
    "if the mass of the gauge boson is much lighter than the mass of the dark matter candidate , @xmath24 , then dark matter annihilations will proceed dominantly through the @xmath25-channel exchange of an @xmath0 to a pair of @xmath1 particles with a cross section given by  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the gauge coupling of the dark force .",
    "note that for dark matter particles with a mass in the range motivated by the aforementioned indirect and direct signals ( @xmath29 gev ) , the measured cosmological density of dark matter will be produced thermally in the early universe for a gauge coupling of @xmath30 , regardless of the mass of the light force carrier , @xmath31 . with this in mind",
    ", we will fix the gauge coupling to this value throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "the leading interaction between the standard model and the dark sector is kinetic mixing between the photon and the @xmath1 , @xmath32 .",
    "and the standard model @xmath33 is also possible , but is expected to be suppressed by @xmath34 relative to that with the photon .",
    "] this has the effect of inducing effective couplings between the @xmath1 and the particle content of the standard model , proportional to their electric charge .",
    "there is no robust prediction for the size of this coupling  in the effective theory , any value of @xmath35 is technically natural ( see the discussion in e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if the standard model is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) , however , this coupling can only be generated after gut breaking at the loop level .",
    "such a loop of heavy states carrying both hypercharge and @xmath0 gauge charge naturally leads to kinetic mixing at the following order  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ratio of the masses in the loop .",
    "thus we expect the kinetic mixing to occur at the level of @xmath38 or less , modulo the possibility of a large hierarchy between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , if the splitting between the different components of the gut multiplet is generated at loop order , then @xmath35 becomes further suppressed by two loops .",
    "a similar set of arguments can be applied if the dark @xmath22 is embedded into its own non - abelian group , at which point 3- and 4-loop suppression becomes natural .",
    "consequently , very small values for @xmath35 could be possible .",
    "we can place a lower limit on @xmath35 , however , by requring that it be large enough to thermalize the system through the process @xmath41 .",
    "this requires that @xmath42 ( for @xmath43 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath44 the system should be thermalized before the temperature of wimp decoupling .",
    "after a dark matter annihilation produces a pair of @xmath1 particles , those particles will decay via this small kinetic mixing into standard model states .",
    "the dominant decay channels of the @xmath1 depend on its mass .",
    "for @xmath45 , @xmath1 decays proceed almost entirely to @xmath8 , whereas for @xmath46 a few hundred mev , @xmath1 decays produce a combination of @xmath8 and @xmath47 . for @xmath1 s with masses between a few hundred mev and a few gev , decays proceed to a combination of charged leptons and mesons .",

    "for heavier masses ( @xmath201 - 3 gev ) , decay channels such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 each contribute significantly to the resulting gamma - ray spectrum .",

    "[ fermi ] , we compare the spectrum of gamma - rays predicted in this model to the spectrum from the galactic center , as observed using the fermi gamma - ray space telescope  @xcite , for two choices of @xmath31 .",
    "we have normalized the gamma - ray flux using a gauge coupling which yields an annihilation cross section of @xmath61 @xmath10/s and have adopted a dark matter distribution consistent with the observed morphology of the gamma - ray signal ( @xmath62 , normalized such that the dark matter density in the local neighborhood is 0.17 gev/@xmath10 and 0.35 gev/@xmath10 in the upper and lower frames , respectively ) . along with the contribution from dark matter annihilations (",

    ", we find that dark matter annihilations can not only accommodate the spectral shape of the observed signal , and also automatically provide the approximate annihilation rate required to normalize the overall flux ( once the dark matter distribution is fixed to the observed morphology of the gamma - ray signal ) .",
    "the peculiar spectrum of synchrotron emission observed from the milky way s non - thermal radio filaments  @xcite can also be easily accounted for in this class of dark matter models . in particular , the significant branching fraction for @xmath63 in this model leads to a spectrum of electrons and positrons that is sufficiently hard and which cuts off above @xmath16 sufficiently abruptly to account for the filaments observed spectral characteristics .",
    "we also note that when compared to the case of dark matter particles which annihilate directly to charged leptons ( democratically to each flavor ) , as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the class of models being considered here deposits a larger fraction of the total annihilation power into electrons and positrons .",
    "quantitatively , for a value of @xmath64 gev ( 100 mev ) , the total power injected into electrons and thus into synchrotron emission is larger than in the democratic lepton benchmark model by a factor of 1.7 ( 2.8 ) .",
    "this provides a somewhat better match to the required normalization of the observed filaments ( see the discussion of filament widths in sec .  4 of ref .",
    "similarly , this increased power into electrons makes it possible to account for the wmap haze with a somewhat lower magnetic field strength in the inner kiloparsecs of the milky galaxy ( @xmath4@xmath65-@xmath66 @xmath67 g at @xmath41 kpc from the galactic center instead of @xmath4@xmath68 g that is otherwise required  @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic mixing between the @xmath1 and the photon leads to spin - independent elastic scattering between the dark matter and protons , with a cross section that is given by : @xmath69 as this cross section is generated through the photon s coupling to electric charge , the corresponding cross section with neutrons is negligible . with kinetic mixing of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , a 1 gev ( 100 mev )",
    "gauge boson will generate an elastic scattering cross section compatible with that required by the signals observed by dama / libra , cogent , and cresst - ii . to find the comparably required cross section per proton .",
    "for example , the nucleon - level cross section @xmath72 @xmath13 required to accommodate the spectrum of events observed by cogent  @xcite translates to a cross section of @xmath73 @xmath13 with protons .",

    "<S> we consider a simple class of models in which the dark matter , @xmath0 , is coupled to a new gauge boson , @xmath1 , with a relatively low mass ( @xmath2 ) . neither the dark matter nor the new gauge boson have tree - level couplings to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter in this model annihilates to @xmath1 pairs , and for a coupling of @xmath3 yields a thermal relic abundance consistent with the cosmological density of dark matter . </S>",
