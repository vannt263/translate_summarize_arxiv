    "for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) [ 1 ] , the enlargement of the higgs sector is considered as one of indispensable ingredients , especially for supersymmetric models . among various supersymmetric extensions of the sm ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the simplest one which has just two higgs doublets in its higgs sector [ 2 ] . in principle , in the models with multiple higgs doublets , the violation of cp symmetry may be accomplished either spontaneously or explicitly by the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs parts [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] . in practice , however , it is known that at the tree level the higgs potential of the mssm conserves cp symmetry , because the complex phase can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields . thus , neither explicit nor spontaneous cp violation can happen in the mssm at the tree level . even at the one - loop level the scenario of spontaneous cp violation",
    "is excluded , because the radiatively corrected higgs potentential of the mssm leads to a very light higgs boson which is unacceptable by the cern @xmath2 lep2 data .    the remaining possibility at the one - loop level for the mssm is then the explicit cp violation scenario .",
    "a number of investigations have been devoted to examine the explicit cp violation in the mssm at one - loop level [ 6 ] . in those investigations",
    "it is observed that the tree - level situation is considerably modified when radiative contributions are included . in particular , the one - loop mssm higgs potential with explicit cp violation is found to allow the lightest neutral higgs boson to possess a mass above the expemental lower bound from the lep2 data .",
    "therefore , the general consensus is that the mssm at the one - loop level can accommodate explicit cp violation .",
    "recently , ibrahim and nath [ 7 ] have investigated explicit cp violation scenario , paying their attention to the phenomenological implications of the non - trivial cp phase on the chargino sector .",
    "they also have computed the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings arising from the neutralino sector , and compared with those from the chargino sector [ 8 ] .",
    "their calculations are quite exhaustive since almost all the relevant loops are included : top quark , the scalar top quark , bottom quark , the scalar bottom quark , tau lepton , the scalar tau lepton , @xmath0 boson , the charged higgs boson , the charginos , @xmath1 boson , the neutral higgs bosons , and the neutralinos .",
    "they have reported that in the mssm with explicit cp violation the neutralino exchange corrections to the mixings of the cp - even sector and the cp - odd sector are comparable to the chargino exchange corrections [ 8 ] .    we would also investigate , in more detail , the higgs sector of the mssm with explicit cp violation at the one - loop level . in our investigation , we take explicitly the terms which are quartic in the electroweak coupling constants into account .",
    "we regard it consistent to consider the quartic terms in the one - loop effective potential contributed by the scalar top quark , the scalar bottom quark , the scalar tau lepton , the chargino , and the neutralinos , because the higgs self contributions are essentially induced by them .",
    "moreover , in our investigation , the pseudoscalar higgs loop contribution is included , when the one - loop contributions to the neutral higgs boson masses are evaluated , as well as all the loops of the relevant particles and superpartners . the inclusion of the pseudoscalar higgs contribution is not only reasonable but also necessary , because there is a non - trivial correlation between the ordinary particles and the corresponding superpartners in the one - loop effective potential . in the neutral sector of the mssm",
    ", there are four neutralinos as superpartners , and as ordinary particles there are @xmath1 boson and three neutral higgs bosons , one of them being the pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "thus , the radiative contribution of the pseudoscalar higgs loop should simultaneously be included , whenever the loops of @xmath1 boson and the two scalar higgs bosons are taken into account , corresponding to the loops of four neutralinos .",
    "but for the pseudoscalar higgs contribution , the mass matrix for the neutral higgs bosons at the one - loop level might be inconsistent and would yield incomplete masses for them and mixing angles among them . in order to obtain reliable results for the higgs productions and their decays ,",
    "it is quite necessary to include the pseudoscalar higgs contribution .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the masses of the neutral higgs bosons in the mssm with explicit cp violation at the one - loop level .",
    "we take into account the loops of the pseudoscalar higgs boson as well as all the loops that have been considered in the investigations of ref .",
    "[ 8 ] , namely , the loops of top quark , the scalar top quarks , bottom quark , the scalar bottom quarks , tau lepton , the scalar tau leptons , @xmath0 boson , the charged higgs boson , the charginos , @xmath1 boson , the scalar higgs bosons , and the neutralinos .",
    "we examine the effect of the contributions of the quartic terms and the pseudoscalar higgs loops .",
    "we find that the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons in the mssm at the one - loop level is evidently affected by the inclusion of the quartic terms and the pseudoscalar higgs contribution .",
    "a starting point to evaluate the neutral higgs boson masses in the mssm with explicit cp violation may be the tree - level higgs potential , which is given in terms of two higgs doublets @xmath3 @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an antisymmetric @xmath7 matrix with @xmath8 , @xmath9 denotes the three pauli matrices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge coupling constants , respectively , and @xmath12 @xmath13 are the soft susy breaking masses .",
    "two soft susy breaking masses @xmath12 @xmath4 may be assumed to be real , without loss of generality .",
    "we assume @xmath14 to be complex .    transforming to a unitary gauge ,",
    "one may express two higgs doublets in the mass eigenstates as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are three neutral higgs fields , @xmath19 is the charged higgs field , and @xmath20 is the relative phase @xmath20 between the two higgs doublets . in the presence of the explicit cp violation , @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 are mixed states of the cp parity . with respect to these three neutral higgs fields",
    ", we have the corresponding minimum conditions as @xmath21 respectively .    at the tree level ,",
    "the phases @xmath22 and @xmath20 can be set to zero .",
    "thus , it is well observed that there is no cp phase in the above tree - level higgs potential . in order to accommodate the explicit cp violation scenario ,",
    "the coefficients in the soft susy breaking terms are assumed to be complex in general . to be specific",
    ", we assume that the following quantities may be complex : the higgs mixing parameters with mass dimension @xmath23 , the u(1 ) gaugino mass @xmath24 , the su(2 ) gaugino mass @xmath25 , and the trilinear soft susy breaking masses @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the complex phases in these quantities are responsible for the cp violation . on the other hand , we take the soft susy breaking masses @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 be real .",
    "now , as the electroweak symmetry is broken spontaneously , the neutral higgs fields develop non - trivial vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",

    "we calculate the radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs sector .",
    "we employ the effective potential method [ 9 ] to estimate radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs sector .",

    "for relatively large @xmath163 = 30 , the masses of the three neutral higgs bosons are obtained as @xmath197 = 115.2 , 300.0 , 300.1 gev for table 7 ( @xmath198 gev ) and 115.0 , 300.0 , 300.2 gev for table 8 ( @xmath23 = 400 gev ) .",
    "we see that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson becomes slightly larger for large @xmath172 .",
    "all of tables 5 - 8 produce the neutral higgs boson masses without contradicting lep2 data .",
    "we have some comments on the radiative corrections due to the loops of @xmath1 boson , the neutral higgs bosons , and the neutralinos .",
    "one can observe in table 5 - 8 that the sum of @xmath199 and @xmath200 are comparatively large .",
    "this implies that the contributions of @xmath1 boson , the neutral higgs bosons ( both scalar and pseudoscalar ) , and neutralinos play important role in the radiative corrections to the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 components at the one - loop level .",
    "especially , this mixing occurs most largely in table 6 as @xmath201 @xmath202 .",
    "the contributions of the neutralino loops depend crucially on the cp phase @xmath68 .",
    "in other words , the cp phase @xmath68 occurs only in the expressions for the neutralino contributions .",
    "now , in order to examine in more detail the dependence of the contributions of the neutralino loops on @xmath68 , we plot @xmath203 , @xmath154 , @xmath204 , and @xmath155 as functions of @xmath68 in fig .",
    "1 , where the values of other parameters are the same as table 5 . we do not plot @xmath132 , @xmath135 and @xmath138 and @xmath141 in fig .",
    "1 , since their contributions are the same as those numerical values of table 5 . in table 5 ,",
    "the contributions of the loops of the scalar quark and the scalar tau lepton are almost null for @xmath154 . for @xmath154 ,",
    "the contributions of neutralino loops are larger than those of the scalar fermions for some values of @xmath68 . for both @xmath154 and @xmath155 , fig .",
    "1 shows that the contributions of the neutralino loops are smaller than the chargino ones for the whole range of @xmath205 .",
    "in the mssm , the tree - level neutral higgs sector may be divided into the scalar part and pseudoscalar part , and there is no mixing between them .",
    "any phase that can cause the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing , hence the cp violation , can be absorbed away at the tree level . at the one - loop level , where explicit cp violation is viable by introducing several cp phases in the effective higgs potential",
    ", the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing occurs in general .",
    "the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing is manifested by the non - vanishing @xmath154 and @xmath155 matrix elements of the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "evidently , these off - diagonal elements affect the masses of the neutral higgs bosons when the mass matrix is diagonalized .",
    "the mass matrix of the neutral higgs boson in the mssm is evaluated at the one - loop level with explicit cp violation . in explicit cp violation scenario ,",
    "five non - trivial cp phases are introduced , from the soft susy breaking terms of the mssm lagrangian , in the masses of the scalar top quarks , the scalar bottom quarks , the scalar tau leptons , the charginos , and the neutralinos .",
    "these phases penetrate into the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "all the contributions of relevant loops are taken into account : the loops of the pseudoscalar higgs boson as well as all the loops of top quark , the scalar top quarks , bottom quark , the scalar bottom quarks , tau lepton , the scalar tau leptons , @xmath0 boson , the charged higgs boson , the charginos , @xmath1 boson , the scalar higgs bosons , and the neutralinos .    especially , we consider the contributions of the terms quartic in the electroweak coupling and the pseudoscalar higgs loop contribution in the one - loop effective potential to the neutral higgs boson masses at the mssm with five explicit cp phases . it is found that the contributions of quartic terms and @xmath192 are definitely non - zero to the ( 3,3)-element of the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the cp mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath18 components can be induced about 25 % of the considered total contribution by the neutralino contributions .",
    "the contributions of @xmath1 boson , the neutral higgs bosons ( both scalar and pseudoscalar ) , and the neutralinos contribute largely to the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 components above other ones .",
