    "recent ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption - line observations have revealed the existence of highly ionized `` high - velocity '' gas clouds along lines of sight to extragalactic uv continuum sources ( sembach et al .  1999 , 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ; murphy et al .  2000 ; wakker et al .  2003 ) .",
    "these gas clouds may be the ionized components , or counterparts , of the well studied neutral hydrogen ( ) high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) ( muller , oort & raimond 1963 ; wakker & van woerden 1997 ; putman et al .",
    "2002 ; de heij , braun & burton 2002 ) , objects which are usually defined as systems with radial velocities inconsistent with differential rotation in the galactic disk .",
    "the origin and nature of the hvcs remains controversial .",
    "one attractive possibility is that at least some of the high velocity gas , both neutral and ionized , represents remnant `` infalling '' material associated with galaxy formation processes ( oort 1970 ; blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; braun & burton 1999 ; sternberg , mckee & wolfire 2002 ) .    in the uv studies ,",
    "many high - ionization metal absorption lines have been detected , including @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , observed with ghrs and stis on board hst , and more recently @xmath14 absorption observed with fuse .",
    "some of the ionized uv absorbers can , in fact , be identified with the large ( @xmath15 deg@xmath16 ) and nearby ( @xmath17 kpc ) hvc `` complexes '' , such as the magellanic stream , or complex c ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , some absorbers , such as those observed towards mrk 509 and pks 2155 - 304 ( sembach et al .  1999 ; collins , shull & giroux  2004 ) do not appear directly linked to such structures , and could be clouds at much larger distances , perhaps distributed within the local group .",
    "the `` high - ion absorbers '' may be the local analogs of metal - line absorbers observed in damped ly@xmath18 systems at high redshifts ( lu et al .",

    "sembach et al .  ( 1999 ) suggested that photoionization by metagalactic radiation in low density clouds may be responsible for the observed towards mrk  509 and pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "however , the detection of highly ionized along these sight - lines strongly suggests that additional processes , such as collisional ionization in conductive interfaces or in thermally unstable cooling gas , are important ( heckman et al .",
    "2002 ; fox et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the properties of purely photoionized clouds , within the context of dark - matter `` mini - halo '' models for the compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ) and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the chvcs are of particular interest .",
    "they are kinematically distinct objects , with typical angular diameters @xmath19 as determined by the recent hipass and leiden - dwingeloo 21 cm surveys ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ; de heij et al .",
    "2002 ) , and they may be at larger characteristic distances from the galaxy disc than are the large hvc complexes . in sternberg , mckee & wolfire ( 2002 ; hereafter smw ) we explored the hypothesis ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; braun & burton 1999 ) that the population of chvcs traces dark - matter ( dm ) substructure ( moore et al .  1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) in the galactic halo or in the more extended local group environment . in this picture",
    "the chvcs are essentially the lower - mass `` cousins '' of the local group dwarf galaxies , and represent objects in which gas is confined to low - mass dark - matter `` mini - halos '' . in smw we focused on the phase properties of hydrogen gas , ionized / neutral / warm / cold , of hydrostatic gas clouds in gravitationally dominant dm halos , including the effects of photoionization and heating by the metagalactic radiation field , and pressure confinement by an external hot medium .",
    "explicit models were constructed for the observed distributions of warm in the local group galaxies leo  a and sag  dig .",
    "the boundaries in these objects are consistent with a cutoff due to photoionization by the metagalactic field .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the associated metals photoionization structures and resulting absorption - line properties of such ( @xmath20 @xmath5 ) mini - halo clouds .",
    "we consider photoionization by the present - day metagalactic field , which is the dominant source of radiation at distances @xmath21  kpc from the galactic disk ( smw ) .",
    "the calculations and models we construct are similar to those presented by kepner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in their mini - halo models for the qso absorption - line systems .",
    "our models are more directly applicable to chvcs in the outer galactic halo and dwarf galaxies in the local group . in particular ,",
    "we determine the conditions required for the formation of highly ionized absorbers similar to the hvcs .",
    "in  2 we discuss the basic parameters of our mini - halo models , and describe the methods we used to compute the metals photoionization structure . in ",

    "we are interested in studying the metals photoionization structures of mini - halo clouds similar to those considered by smw in their analysis of the chvcs and local group dwarf galaxies .",

    "the clouds typically consist of `` warm neutral medium '' ( wnm ) cores , surrounded by `` warm ionized medium '' ( wim ) shielding envelopes that absorb the incident photoionizing radiation .",

    "this fit , which we plot in figure 1 , is based on observational constraints for the optical / uv and x - rays ( bernstein , freedman & madore 2002 ; martin , hurwitz & bowyer 1991 ; chen , fabian , & gendreau 1997 ) .",
    "for the unobservable radiation from the lyman limit to @xmath52  kev it is based on theoretical models ( haardt & madau 1996 ; see also shull et al .",
    "second , we consider a `` maximal field '' that is enhanced between the lyman limit and 0.25 kev as illustrated by the dashed line in figure 1 .",
    "for photon energies above the lyman limit our maximal field is represented by @xmath53 it is identical to the standard field in the optical / uv and x - rays , except for the enhancement from the lyman limit to @xmath52  kev .",

    ", we begin by calculating the coupled hydrostatic and ionization structures of pure hydrogen - helium mini - halo clouds , assuming a primordial helium abundance @xmath54 , and following the iterative radiative transfer procedures outlined by smw . for the range of metallicities ( 0.1 to 0.3 times solar ) and total hydrogen column densities ( up to @xmath55 @xmath50 ) that we consider , the opacity is dominated by the hydrogen and helium absorptions , and metals are negligible .",
    "dust opacity may also be ignored , assuming galactic dust properties , and a dust to gas ratio proportional to the metallicity . @xmath50 for galactic dust ( draine  2003 ) .",

    "the result of these calculations is the density and ionization profiles of the hydrogen - helium gas , extending from the halo center to an outer cloud radius , @xmath58 , where the wim gas pressure equals the bounding him pressure .",
    "given the density profile we then calculate the local absorbed radiation field @xmath59 where in this expression @xmath60 is the unattenuated field , @xmath61 is the hydrogen - helium photo - absorption cross - section , @xmath62 is the column density from @xmath63 to the cloud surface along a ray inclined at an angle @xmath64 relative to the radial direction , and where @xmath65 .",
    "finally , given the local hydrostatic hydrogen gas density , @xmath66 , and the previously computed local absorbed radiation field , @xmath67 , we use the photoionization code cloudy ( version 94.00 , ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) to calculate the local equilibrium ionization states for the metals . in this procedure",

    "we recall that these two models were constructed by smw to match the observed chvc thermal phase properties , assuming `` circumgalactic '' or `` extragalactic '' distances of 150 or 750 kpc for these objects . the characteristic mass - scale for the chvc mini - halos",

    "1999 ; smw ) . as we will show , the assumed external pressures ( @xmath107 @xmath7 k ) in these models severely limit the abundances of the high ions produced by photoionization in the wim envelopes .",
    "second , we consider _ gravitationally - confined _ clouds in more massive ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) `` dwarf - galaxy '' scale halos , in which enhanced gravitational binding of the gas allows for lower external confining pressures and hence increased ionization in the wim .    in table",
    "[ models ] we list the basic input parameters for the various models .",

    "the relatively high external pressures in these models ensures that , ( a ) the gas remains bound to the halos at all cloud radii , and that ( b ) the gas is compressed to densities that allow the formation of neutral hydrogen cores ( which are then detectable as 21 cm sources ) .",
    "for such low - mass halos , the gas becomes ionized and then unbound as @xmath109 is reduced .",

    "second , the absolute ion densities may be maximized in inner regions where the overall gas densities are larger , or where the ionization parameter is optimized for the production of the particular ion .",
    "third , the absorption of the ionizing radiation , especially near the ionization front , modifies the ionization structure .",

    "however , the central density @xmath131 depends on the halo potential and becomes small for underconcentrated halos .",
    "thus , @xmath160 may be used as a dynamical probe of the halo concentration parameter .",
    "for example , the / column density ratio increases from @xmath161 to @xmath162 from model a to b. the increase in the / ratio is primarily due to the increase in cloud size , from model a to b , as the concentration parameter decreases from 32.5 to 8.15 .    in table",
