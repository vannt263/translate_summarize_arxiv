    "applied economists routinely test their models for the presence of structural change .",
    "if the evidence supports it , a threshold model is constructed and one needs to detect the thresholds ( also called break points ) at which to split the sample .",
    "the threshold variable may be an element of regressors .",
    "one such example is the well - known threshold autoregressive model ( see tong , 2012 ) .",
    "sometimes the threshold variable is simply the index of observed samples ( eg .",
    "time in a time series model ) and the model is commonly referred to as the change point model or segmented regression ( see yao and au , 1989 , perron , 2006 , fearnhead and vasileiou , 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the setting where multiple thresholds exist which is a much more challenging problem than a single break - point detection ( hansen , 2000 ) .",
    "a number of issues arise in the presence of multiple change points .",
    "these include the determination of the number of breaks , estimation of the thresholds given the number , and statistical analysis of the resulting estimators .",
    "there exists a rich literature devoted to this field .",
    "for example , inclan and tiao ( 1994 ) identified multiple change - points of variance using the iterated cumulative sum of squares ( icss ) algorithm .",
    "bai and perron ( 2003 ) developed the dynamic programming principle for the estimation of multiple change - points in linear regression .",
    "following the familiar idea of penalized estimation , harchaoui and lvy - leduc ( 2010 ) used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) algorithm to estimate the locations of multiple change - points , in one - dimensional piecewise constant signals . similarly , davis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed a genetic algorithm to detect multiple break points , and jin , shi and wu ( 2013 ) considered non - concave penalty functions including the smoothly clipped absolute deviation ( scad ) penalty and minimax concave penalty ( mcp ) penalty in piecewise stationary autoregressive processes .",
    "very few authors considered the problem of estimating multiple thresholds for survival regression analysis . censored lifetime data",
    "break down the usual estimation framework for completely observed data .",
    "we usually can not attain a closed - form solution for regression estimates and therefore face an increased complexity of estimating thresholds accurately . to address this under - developed issue",
    ", we consider the accelerate failure time ( aft ) model as a typical example of regression models in this paper and contribute a new methodology on change - point problem for survival data analysis .",
    "the aft model permits a direct assessment of the covariate effects on the survival time , facilitating the interpretation of regression coefficients for the mean response .",
    "there are many estimation methods available for aft model in the literature , including buckley and james ( 1979 ) , prentice ( 1978 ) , tsiatis ( 1990 ) , ying ( 1993 ) , lin , wei and ying ( 1998 ) .",
    "most of the estimation methods for right censored data are rank - based and in practice the estimating functions may be discontinuous , producing challenges to the computation . in particular , stute ( 1993 , 1996 ) proposed a weighted least squares estimator in aft model , and established the consistency and asymptotic normality . recently",
    "huang , ma and xie ( 2006 ) carried out a variable selection procedure and estimation in aft model with high - dimensional covariates based on stute s estimator . in this paper , we formally adopt the stute estimator to study the parameter estimation for the aft model with @xmath0 thresholds , where @xmath1 is unspecified . using a two - stage procedure proposed in this paper we may estimate the thresholds and the regression coefficients simultaneously .",
    "interestingly our procedure may be straight forwardly extended to incorporate variable selection for high - dimensional data analysis .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the multiple break - point problem for the aft model is formulated .",
    "we then propose a two - stage procedure to detect the thresholds and estimate model parameters .",
    "in section 3 , we establish theoretical properties of our procedure .",
