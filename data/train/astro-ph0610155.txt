    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are highly energetic astrophysical objects , which are often accompanied with relativistic jets powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes located at the central region of galaxies .",
    "the agns radiate in a wide frequency range , from radio waves to @xmath0-rays . the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , which detects @xmath0-rays in gev energy , have found @xmath4 agns with its all - sky survey campaign , and all of them but one ( m87 ) were classified as `` blazars '' @xcite .",
    "the features in the spectrum and light curves of these blazars indicate that the relativistic jets are directed towards us .",
    "the _ gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) _ is equipped with the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument , which is an upgraded version of the egret .",
    "its large effective area ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) as well as good angular resolution improve a point - source sensitivity by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the egret , which would increase the source statistics significantly .",
    "it is expected that a thousand to ten thousand blazars would be detected as point sources by glast @xcite .",
    "such a dramatic improvement in point - source sensitivity would allow us to determine the @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( glf ) of blazars with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "in contrast , the current blazar glf is based upon merely @xmath4 blazars detected by egret .",
    "as the blazars should trace the large - scale structure of the universe , they should exhibit spatial clustering . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the spatial clustering of blazars is detectable by glast , especially by focusing on the angular power spectrum , a quantity projected along the line of sight .",
    "this would provide the first direct measurement of the bias parameter of blazars , immediately after glast starts taking the data , which should be compared with the results from other classes of agns in order to get further insight into the unification picture of agns .",
    "in addition to blazars , it has been pointed out that glast may detect @xmath0-ray emission from clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we thus also calculate the spatial clustering of clusters of galaxies in @xmath0-rays and discuss its detectability with glast .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : angular power spectrum of blazars ] we calculate the angular power spectrum of blazars that would be detected by glast . in section  [ sub : detectability of the blazar correlation ]",
    "we study detectability of the spatial correlation of blazars and discuss current ( indirect ) observational constraints on the bias of blazars . in section  [ sec : angular power spectrum of galaxy clusters ] we calculate the angular power spectrum of galaxy clusters .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to further discussions , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the angular power spectrum of blazars that would be detected by glast is given by the sum of the shot ( poisson ) noise term , @xmath7 , and the correlation term , @xmath8 , as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of blazars per solid angle , and @xmath11 is the angular correlation function of blazars that would be detected by glast .",
    "note that the shot noise term is independent of multipoles .",
    "a standard procedure to calculate the angular correlation function is as follows .",
    "we model the 3-d spatial correlation function of blazars , @xmath12 , as the correlation function of dark matter particles , multiplied by the `` bias '' factors that depend on physics of formation and evolution of blazars in dark matter haloes .",
    "we then project the resulting 3-d correlation function on the sky to calculate the 2-d angular correlation function of blazars , @xmath11 .",
    "as the bias factors depend on redshift and luminosity of blazars , we model @xmath12 as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance between two blazars , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are their luminosities , and @xmath17 is the 3-d correlation function of @xmath18 dark matter fluctuations .",
    "as we show in this paper the angular correlation function of blazars may be detectable only on large scales , and thus the linear correlation function and the linear bias model would provide a good approximation . by projecting the 3-d correlation function on the sky , one obtains @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the comoving distance out to an object at @xmath3 , @xmath21 is the comoving volume element per unit solid angle and per unit redshift range , @xmath22 is the average bias of blazars weighted by the @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( glf ) of blazars , @xmath23 : @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the cumulative glf of blazars , i.e. , glf integrated from a given minimum luminosity cut - off , @xmath26 note that we have not used the so - called `` small - angle approximation '' or `` limber s approximation , '' as we are mainly interested in the signals on large angular scales , @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate @xmath17 from the power spectrum of linear matter density fluctuations , @xmath27 : @xmath28 we use the linear transfer function given in @xcite to compute @xmath27 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : c_l^p ] ) and ( [ eq : c_l^c ] ) suggest that @xmath29 dominates when the number of blazars detected by glast is small , making it difficult to detect the correlation term .",
    "it is therefore very important to understand how many blazars one can detect with glast . in the next subsection",
    "we calculate the expected number count of blazars for glast using the latest glf of blazars @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind the model of the glf of blazars proposed by @xcite is that the jet activity that powers @xmath0-ray emission from blazars must be related to accretion onto the central black holes , from which x - ray emission emerges ; thus , the x - ray and @xmath0-ray luminosity of blazars must be correlated .",
    "we use the following relation between glf of blazars , @xmath30 , and x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns , @xmath31 : @xmath32 the advantage of this method is that the xlf has been determined accurately by the extensive study of the x - ray background @xcite , and thus the predicted glf would also be fairly accurate , provided that the @xmath0-ray luminosity and x - ray luminosity of blazars are tightly correlated . since not all agns detected in x - rays are blazars ,",
    "we have introduced a normalization factor , @xmath33 .",
    "we relate the @xmath0-ray luminosity , @xmath34 , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath35 , of blazars by a linear relation with the constant of proportionality given by @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath34 represents @xmath38 at 100 mev , and @xmath35 is the x - ray luminosity integrated over the _ rosat _",

    "we call this model the `` luminosity - dependent density evolution '' model , ldde .    how robust are our predictions from this model ?",
    "the most important parameter for our purpose in this paper is the slope of xlf in the faint end , @xmath61 , as the expected number count of blazars that would be detected by glast is sensitive to how many blazars there are in the faint end of luminosity function . @xcite have fitted the glf of blazars detected by egret in order to find @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath33 , with the other parameters fixed at the best - fitting values from the xlf given above .",
    "( the blazar sample from egret was constructed by requiring that egret sources were identified as blazars by radio observations .",
    "the probability that the blazars giving the flux above the egret point source sensitivity also gives the sufficient radio flux was taken into account in their analysis . )",
    "they have found that @xmath63 best describes the glf of egret blazars .",
    "this @xmath61 is larger than that obtained from the xlf , @xmath64 , at the 3-@xmath65 level , which may imply that a better model is needed ; however , we do not investigate this point any further and simply accept @xmath66 as the canonical value for the glf of blazars .",

    ".parameters of the ldde glfs and the expected number , @xmath67 , and the surface number density , @xmath68 , of blazars that would be detected by glast .",
    "we have assumed that no blazars fainter than @xmath69  erg  s@xmath70 would exist , and glast lat can detect the flux down to @xmath71 @xmath72 s@xmath70 for 2 years of all - sky observations . [",

    "the cumulative luminosity function , @xmath25 [ equation  ( [ eq : phi function ] ) ] , for the cluster @xmath0-ray emission from the inverse - compton scattering is thus given by @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the formation rate of clusters with mass of @xmath75 at @xmath3 , per comoving volume , and @xmath76 is the time scale during which @xmath0-rays are radiated efficiently from each cluster .",
    "we calculate @xmath76 as either the inverse - compton cooling time or the shock wave propagation time ( whichever is longer ) : @xmath77 . in most cases of our interest , the latter is always much longer than the former , and therefore , @xmath78 gyr , independent of @xmath75 , where @xmath79 is the virial radius and @xmath80 the sound speed .",
    "the formation rate of clusters , @xmath74 , is given by the time - derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath81 , corrected for the halo destruction rate @xcite .",
    "similar to the proton - proton collision case , we calculate the total energy of relativistic electrons , @xmath82 , by assuming that a fraction , @xmath83 , of the gravitational binding energy of baryons is given to electrons .",
    "we use a power law with an index of @xmath84 ( either 2 or 2.2 ; see table  [ table : cluster models ] ) for the @xmath0-ray spectrum , with an upper cutoff whose energy is determined by a balance between the acceleration time scale and the cooling time scale . to calculate the acceleration time scale we use the magnetic field energy given by @xmath85 times the binding energy of baryons .",
    "we choose @xmath86 , and @xmath87 as our models , and we call them ic1 , ic2 , and ic3 , respectively",
    ". the ic1 model is investigated by @xcite , and it gives maximally allowed number of @xmath0-ray emitting clusters , as the ic1 model predicts the egrb flux that is as large as what is measured by egret .",
    "these models are again summarized in table  [ table : cluster models ] and fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : c_l_cluster ] shows the angular power spectrum of these @xmath0-ray clusters with the binned error boxes ( @xmath90 ) as well as the shot noise term for ( a)(c ) proton - proton collision and ( d)(f ) inverse - compton models .",
    "the correlation is quite significant particularly for optimistic models predicting large number of @xmath0-ray emitting clusters being detected by glast , i.e. , @xmath91 and ic1 . the last column of table  [ table : cluster models ] shows the signal - to - noise ratio for the power spectrum averaged over @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "we find that the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds unity for all the models that we have considered : the minimum is @xmath94 for ic3 , and the maximum is 7.0 for @xmath91 , despite the fact that only small number of clusters are expected to be seen in the glast data .",
    "this is because clusters of galaxies are formed in the high - density peaks and thus are highly biased .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ table : cluster models ] shows the average bias factors of clusters at @xmath95 .",
    "while follow - up programs should reveal the identity of the glast @xmath0-ray sources and also some of the galaxy clusters might appear as extended sources , at very early stage of glast observational campaign , all the point sources should more generally be considered to be mixed of various emitters .",
    "here we consider two - population case , blazars and galaxy clusters .",
    "our purpose in this section is to investigate whether it is possible to distinguish the blazar component from that of clusters by the angular clustering , even before the follow - ups .",
    "when there are more than one species of sources on the sky , one should also consider cross - correlation between different species .",
    "when there are blazars and galaxy clusters in the @xmath0-ray sky , the angular power spectrum is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the spectra from blazars ( section  [ sec : angular power spectrum of blazars ] ) and clusters ( section  [ sec : angular power spectrum of galaxy clusters ] ) , respectively .",
    "the surface number density of sources in this case is instead given by the sum of the two species , @xmath99 .",
    "the last term , @xmath100 , represents the cross - correlation between blazars and galaxy clusters , and is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 [ equation  ( [ eq : phi function ] ) ] and @xmath103 [ equation  ( [ eq : phi pp ] ) or ( [ eq : phi ic ] ) ] as well as @xmath104 [ equation  ( [ eq : averaged bias ] ) ] and @xmath105 [ equation  ( [ eq : averaged bias pp ] ) or ( [ eq : averaged bias ic ] ) ] have been given in the previous sections .",
    "figure  [ fig : c_l_cross ] shows the angular power spectrum of glast point sources , including blazars ( ldde1 and @xmath106 ) and galaxy clusters for various models . if the average blazar bias is as large as 3 , the power spectrum from blazars almost always dominates the signal , especially at low @xmath107 s . an interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_l_cross ] is that the shape of blazar power spectrum and cluster spectrum are quite distinct : the cluster spectrum falling towards low multipoles more rapidly than the blazar spectrum ( i.e. , the cluster spectrum rising towards high multipoles more rapidly than the blazar spectrum ) .",
    "therefore , when the blazar signal dominates ( @xmath108 and ic3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_l_cross ] ) , one would see a shallower power spectrum , while when the cluster signal dominates ( @xmath91 and ic1 ) , one would see a steeper power spectrum at @xmath109 . this feature may help us identify the dominant source of clustering seen by glast .",
    "we do not know which point sources glast would detect , blazars or clusters , until the follow - up observations are carried out ; however , the angular power spectrum may provide us with useful information regarding the dominant species .",
    "the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ) survey @xcite has detected @xmath110k radio sources over 9,033 square degrees , or @xmath111 sources per square degree , with the source detection threshold of 1  mjy at 1.4  ghz . since",
    "many of the glast point sources will be within the first field of view , the first survey will provide us with valuable information regarding identification of the point sources that would be detected by glast .    how bright are blazars and galaxy clusters in radio ?",
    "the egret blazar catalogue was constructed such that the egret sources are also detected in radio .",
    "the correlation between radio and @xmath0-ray luminosities of blazars is not yet well understood , and there is a considerable dispersion @xcite .",
    "however , the standard synchrotron self - compton model of blazars predicts that there should be some correlation .",
    "@xcite assumed a proportional relation between mean radio luminosity , @xmath112 , and @xmath34 , with a dispersion obeying to the log - normal distribution , and found that mean relation of @xmath113 and dispersion @xmath114 fitted the observed data well . using this relation and assuming that the spectral index in radio is given by @xmath115 ( because the radio emission is due to synchrotron radiation ) , we find that the flux in radio that corresponds to the limiting flux for the point sources that can be detected by glast in @xmath0-rays is given by @xmath116 , where we have used equation  ( [ eq : limflux ] ) .",
    "we thus find @xmath117  mjy , which is an order of magnitude brighter than the limiting flux for the point sources detected by the first survey .. ] therefore , we expect the radio counterparts for the glast blazars to be found in the existing first point source catalogue ( if they are within the first field of view ) , although some sources which deviate from the @xmath112@xmath34 relation above may be missed .",
    "the radio emission from galaxy clusters is also likely from synchrotron radiation . for",
    "the inverse - compton scenario one can estimate the luminosity in radio from a ratio of the cmb and magnetic field energy density , in which case the radio luminosity from galaxy clusters is much smaller than that expected from blazars having the same @xmath0-ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "for the proton - proton collision scenario they would be even dimmer in radio ; otherwise they should also be detectable by @xmath0-rays due to the electron inverse - compton scattering .",
    "therefore , unlike blazars , galaxy clusters would not be identifiable with the first survey , which makes the first survey a good diagnosis tool for identification of the glast point sources .      based upon the results that we have obtained so far ,",
    "we here show one example strategy for the point source survey and identification of blazars that would be carried out by glast .",
    "\\(i ) _ source detection._after its launch , glast will start detecting @xmath0-ray sources from all the directions on the sky .",
    "some of them would be extended sources ( such as nearby galaxy clusters ) , and some would be highly variable ( such as @xmath0-ray bursts ) . these sources should be removed .",
    "\\(ii ) _ removing galaxy clusters._as blazars are also bright in radio but galaxy clusters are not , one may remove galaxy clusters from the glast data using the source catalogue from the first survey ( section  [ sub : source identification due to radio survey ] ) .",
    "( iii ) _ updating glf and further cut._with the glast source catalogue from ( ii ) , which would consist mostly of blazars , one may update the glf of blazars by extending it down to fainter sources than those that egret has detected . at this point we probably gain some insight as to which glf model fits the data better , ldde1 or ldde2 , or whether or not we need a different glf model .",
    "if ldde1 is indeed confirmed , then one needs other populations of sources in order to explain the bulk of egrb .",
    "\\(iv ) _ analysis of angular power spectrum._measure the angular power spectrum of the sources that have survived the cuts in ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "since we have currently several models which predict a variety of the blazar bias , from 0.4 to 4 ( section  [ sec : modeling blazar bias ] ) , the power spectrum measured at @xmath118 should provide us with useful information regarding the blazar bias .",
    "while we would expect the contribution from galaxy clusters is minimal in this catalogue owing to the cuts in ( i ) and ( ii ) , the shape of the power spectrum would also provide useful ( albeit indirect ) confirmation that the bulk of the sources in the catalogue are blazars .",
    "the blazar bias measured from glast , or an upper limit on the bias , would be the first direct measurement of the bias of blazars , which would shed light on the formation process of blazars and their link to the quasars detected in the optical and the agns detected in x - rays .",
    "\\(v ) _ completion of follow - ups : beginning of precision study._when the source identification with direct follow - up observations is complete , one should revisit the blazar source catalogue again , establish the glf of blazars more firmly , and re - analyze the angular power spectrum . at this point",
    "it would also be possible to obtain the 3-d power spectrum , as opposed to the angular spectrum , using the redshift information from follow - up observations .",
    "this would be very powerful in constraining the formation and evolution of blazars , as one can constrain the evolution of blazar bias as a function of redshift , provided that enough number of blazars are detected by glast .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the angular power spectrum of blazars and galaxy clusters that would be detected by glast .",
    "we have shown that glast can detect the spatial clustering of blazars if the average bias of blazars exceeds 1.2 and 0.5 , for the canonical glf model ( ldde1 ) that accounts for 2550% of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egrb ) and the extreme model ( ldde2 ) that accounts for all the egrb , respectively @xcite .",
    "while the blazar bias is not known with any precision , current observations seem to suggest , albeit indirectly , that it can take on any values between @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; thus , the glast data will provide us with the first , direct estimate of the bias of blazars which , in turn , would constrain the formation and evolution of blazars .    as for galaxy clusters , which are highly biased objects , we have found that the signal - to - noise ratio of the correlation exceeds unity for all the models we have considered ( table  [ table : cluster models ] ) : proton - proton collisions followed by pion decay @xcite , and inverse - compton scattering of relativistic electrons off cmb @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the angular power spectra of blazars and galaxy clusters are quite distinct at low multipoles , @xmath109 , the blazar spectrum being much shallower than the cluster one .",
    "this feature helps us identify the population dominating the angular power spectrum of the point sources that would be detected by glast .",
    "although the full follow - up observations would take long time , a quick ( but less accurate ) identification of sources is possible with the existing first survey data in radio at 1.4  ghz , as most of the blazars should also be bright enough to be seen in radio , while galaxy clusters should not .",
    "we have given an example strategy for using the angular power spectrum as a diagnosis tool for blazars in section  [ sub : proposal for blazar anisotropy measurement with glast ] .",
    "with an impressive number of blazars as well as galaxy clusters expected to be detected by glast , one should maximize the scientific outcome from the glast data by using as many tools as possible . the angular power spectrum ( or angular correlation function )",
    "is easy to calculate from the point source catalogue , and would give us invaluable information about the spatial clustering of blazars and high - energy activity in clusters of galaxies , which are poorly known at present .",

    "<S> blazars , a beamed population of active galactic nuclei , radiate high - energy @xmath0-rays , and thus are a good target for the _ gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast)_. as the blazars trace the large - scale structure of the universe , one may observe spatial clustering of blazars . we calculate the angular power spectrum of blazars that would be detected by glast . </S>",
    "<S> we show that we have the best chance of detecting their clustering at large angular scales , @xmath1 , where shot noise is less important , and the dominant contribution to the correlation comes from relatively low redshift , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the glast can detect the correlation signal , if the blazars detected by glast trace the distribution of low-@xmath3 quasars observed by optical galaxy surveys , which have the bias of unity . </S>",
    "<S> if the bias of blazars is greater than 1.5 , glast will detect the correlation signal unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that glast may detect spatial clustering of clusters of galaxies in @xmath0-rays . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the angular power spectrum is different for blazars and clusters of galaxies ; thus , we can separate these two contributions on the basis of the shape of the power spectrum .    </S>",
