    "the schwinger model @xcite , i.e. quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions , is the simplest gauge theory . since its formulation in 1962",
    ", it has attracted much attention . notwithstanding its apparent simplicity ,",
    "its physics is surprisingly rich and in several aspects resembles much more complex theories , in particular quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . as such ,",
    "the schwinger model has become the standard toy model for testing lattice techniques .    in particular , it was proposed to use lattice hamiltonian methods for investigation of its properties @xcite .",
    "using these techniques , several properties of the massless and massive schwinger model were investigated and many interesting results were obtained .    in this paper , we concentrate on the massless case for the 1-flavour model . our main aim is to show that lattice hamiltonian methods can yield results with unprecedented precision  _ a few orders of magnitude more precise _ than their previous applications .",
    "we concentrate on three simple quantites  the ground state ( gs ) energy , the scalar mass gap and the vector mass gap .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the essentials of the hamiltonian approach and the lattice method used .",
    "[ sec : results ] presents our results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize , compare our results with previous estimates and shortly discuss the prospects of the method .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of the lattice schwinger model in the kogut - susskind ( staggered ) discretization @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a single - component fermion field , defined on each site of an @xmath3-site lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. on a circle ) and obeying the anticommutation relations @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the fermion ( `` quark '' ) mass .",
    "the gauge field variable @xmath8 is defined on the link between sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 and is related to the spatial component of the abelian vector potential by @xmath11 ( we work in the temporal gauge @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the gauge coupling and @xmath14 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is related to the electric field @xmath16 by the relation @xmath17 and to the gauge field by the commutation relations : @xmath18=i\\delta_{nm}$ ] .",
    "the possible values of @xmath15 are quantized : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "this implies the following action of @xmath21 on the basis states : @xmath22 .",
    "let us now consider the choice of the basis , which is essential for numerical investigations .",
    "the natural choice is the direct product of ising basis , acted upon by pauli spin operators , and the ladder space of states \\{@xmath27 } , acted upon by the operator @xmath15 and the rising and lowering operators @xmath21 . with an @xmath3-site lattice ,",
    "the dimension of the spin part is @xmath28 , while for the gauge part the basis is infinite - dimensional .",
    "hence , the whole basis is infinite - dimensional even on a finite lattice .",
    "clearly , for numerical computation , some choice of ( a finite number of ) basis states has to be made .",
    "one possibility , motivated by the physics of the problem , is to truncate at some finite @xmath29 .",
    "however , such an approach gives prohibitively large bases even for moderate lattice sizes @xmath3 , since the region of physically important values of @xmath30 quickly increases as one approaches the continuum limit , adding to the exponential increase of the basis size from the spin part .",
    "fortunately , a much better truncation procedure exists , using the strong coupling expansion ( sce ) @xcite .",
    "rewrite the hamiltonian in a dimensionless form : @xmath31 with : @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 the continuum limit of the model corresponds to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the sce parameter @xmath38 is conventionally denoted @xmath39 in lattice gauge theory literature .    formally , the operator @xmath40 can be treated as an unperturbed part and @xmath41 as a perturbation .",
    "it is easy to see that the ground state of @xmath40 , which we will denote by @xmath42 , is given by : @xmath43 for all sites @xmath9 ) , @xmath44 .",
    "the perturbation operator @xmath41 flips two neighbouring spins for the spin part . ] and couples them via a gauge field excitation ( flux line ) @xmath45 .",
    "for example , for a 4-site lattice : @xmath46 ) , i.e. @xmath47 ( @xmath48 means no excitation , i.e. spin alignment corresponding to the ground state ) is referred to as a `` quark '' , whereas an excitation on an even site ( subscript e ) , i.e. @xmath49 is an `` antiquark '' .",
    "thus , @xmath50 is a `` meson '' ( quark - antiquark with a directed gauge field link connecting them ) and , correspondingly @xmath51 an `` antimeson '' ( flux line directed in the other direction ) .",
    "the above state @xmath52 is hence a superposition of all possible 1-meson ( `` scalar ''  superscript @xmath53 ) states corresponding to one quark ",
    "one antiquark excitation .",
    "we will call such a superposition a _ class of states_. a class of states is translationally invariant , however , since we are working in the staggered lattice formalism , a meson can only be translated by an even number of sites , if an odd number of sites translation is performed , the meson is transformed to an antimeson ( `` charge conjugation '' operation ) .",
    "one additional symmetry operation that can be performed on each class of states is a change of `` helicity '' @xmath54 i.e. the clockwise numbering of lattice sites to an anti - clockwise ( and taking into account the inequivalence of even and odd sites ) , or vice versa .",
    "any of the following operations , or any combination of them ",
    "translation by two lattice sites @xmath55 , `` charge conjugation '' @xmath56 and `` helicity '' @xmath54  leaves the class of states @xmath57 ( and any other class ) invariant .",
    "the construction of the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath58 basis is performed in the following way .",
    "one starts with the ground state @xmath42 and acts with the perturbation operator @xmath41 on it to obtain a 1-meson class of states @xmath57 .",
    "then , one acts again with @xmath41 , obtaining a 2-meson class of states and a 0-meson class of states ( i.e. ground state ) etc . in general , a @xmath59-meson class of states , acted on with @xmath41 , can produce several @xmath60- and @xmath61-meson classes of states : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is @xmath64-th @xmath59-meson class of `` scalar '' states and @xmath65 , @xmath66 are coefficients that have to be calculated for each state .",
    "states belonging to a given class of states are all states related by the operations @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "all generated classes of states are eigenstates of the unperturbed operator @xmath40 ( diagonal elements of @xmath58 ) , while states with different numbers of mesons are related via off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath67 .",
    "one can also construct the hamiltonian @xmath68 starting from the lowest `` vector '' ( 1-meson ) class of states ( instead of the 0-meson state @xmath42 ) : @xmath69 acting several times with @xmath41 on @xmath70 allows to obtain the `` vector''-states hamiltonian matrix @xmath68 in the @xmath71 basis .",
    "obviously , the construction of the hamiltonian basis can proceed indefinitely , since each site can be connected to a neighbouring one by gauge links ( flux lines ) with arbitrary @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we truncate at some finite order @xmath73 of sce .",
    "we will show that a finite @xmath73 is enough to extract the relevant physics .",
    "the value of @xmath73 needed depends on the lattice spacing and grows as the continuum limit is approached . a particular role , to be discussed below ,",
    "is played by closed flux lines , i.e. flux loops .",
    "when the order of sce @xmath73 becomes equal to the number of sites @xmath3 , the following class of states appears : @xmath74 with all spins pointing in the same direction as in the ground state ( no quarks or antiquarks and hence no mesons ) , but with a flux line connecting all sites and hence forming a flux loop ( the sign of ` 1 ' in the ladder space part of a basis state corresponds to either a clockwise or anticlockwise orientation of gauge links circulating around the loop ) .",
    "increasing @xmath73 , one encounters states with an increasing number of flux loops  eq .   with",
    "` 1 ' replaced by an arbitrary @xmath75 ( starting at sce order @xmath76 ) .    to summarize this part , let us shortly comment on the total size of the basis and its scaling with the lattice size . in the adopted approach",
    ", the size of the spin part of the basis grows much slower than exponentially .",
    "zero magnetization sector for an @xmath3-site lattice consists of @xmath77 states .",
    "grouping states into classes of states by using symmetry operations @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath54 further decreases the spin part basis size .",
    "the total basis size is then determined by the value of the maximal allowed number of flux loops @xmath78 , i.e. by the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "note that some given maximal allowed @xmath78 does not imply in general that @xmath80 , as can be naively expected , which does not have closed flux loops ( i.e. it occurs even if max .",
    "@xmath81 ) , but still has @xmath82 in the gauge part . ] .",
    "therefore , it is still unavoidable that increasing the lattice size @xmath3 and keeping fixed the ratio @xmath83 , the total basis size grows ( approximately ) exponentially .",
    "we will give some explicit values of the total basis size in the next section .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in three quantites : the ground state energy , the scalar mass gap and the vector mass gap",
    ". the @xmath64-th eigenvalue ( @xmath84 ) of the hamiltonian @xmath58 will be denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "we define the following quantites ( and also include the exact values in the continuum limit , for the massless case @xmath86 ) :    * gs energy : @xmath87{a\\rightarrow0 } \\qquad -\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\approx -0.3183098862,\\ ] ] * scalar mass gap : @xmath88{a\\rightarrow0 } \\qquad \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\approx 1.1283791668,\\ ] ] * vector mass gap : @xmath89{a\\rightarrow0 } \\qquad \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\approx 0.5641895836,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 stands for the lowest eigenvalue of the `` vector '' hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    ".simulation parameters  inverse coupling @xmath38 , lattice sizes @xmath3 , maximum order of sce @xmath73 .",
    "we also give the dimension of the `` vector '' hamiltonian matrix @xmath68 for our largest lattice size @xmath91 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     obviously , since exact results are known , this is rather pointless with double precision numbers ( several iterations of an algorithm with many operations per iteration , accumulating @xmath92 errors per operation ) .",
    "hence , increasing precision beyond what we present in this paper would need an increased machine precision . ] .",
    "we believe , though , that the results presented in this paper are very interesting .",
    "exact results are approached with remarkable rapidity using only moderate lattice sizes  8 to 14 lattice sites .",
    "the success of the method should therefore be attributed to working very close to the continuum limit , at inverse coupling @xmath93 a few orders of magnitude larger than in typical lattice simulations , using e.g. monte carlo methods . in earlier applications of hamiltonian techniques ,",
    "it was also not realized that the continuum limit extrapolation can be performed using very high values of @xmath38 .",
    "using rather small values of @xmath38 , exact results could be approached with a precision of the order of 0.1 - 1% ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : compare ] ) .",
    "the impressive improvement of this precision with the dmrg method @xcite by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , the error of the final result for the vector mass gap is @xmath94 .",
    "however , taking into account the estimated error , i.e. @xmath95 , the actual precision claimed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is of @xmath96 . ]",
    "seemed to set impassable limits for lattice hamiltonian methods .",
    "however , as we have shown in this paper , this precision can be easily surpassed by another 3 - 4 orders of magnitude , applying only very simple ideas .",
    "there is no straightforward way to extend the method presented in this paper to the massive case .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the mass gap @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) at an arbitrary quark mass @xmath99 can be expressed as : @xmath100 where the first term @xmath101 is mass independent and given by the leading order term of mass perturbation theory of mass gap expansion @xcite , i.e. @xmath102 or @xmath103 for the vector and scalar case , respectively .",
    "the second term @xmath104 , the mass gap shift from massive quarks , depends on @xmath99 and has been calculated in mass perturbation theory up to second order in @xmath99 .",
    "our data indicate that @xmath101 can be calculated accurately even if the physical system size is very small with respect to the size of the meson under consideration ( which is the case in our analysis very close to the continuum limit , i.e. at very small lattice spacing , and with our rather small lattice sizes ) .",
    "however , the shift @xmath104 , incorporating effects of quark masses , requires that the physical system size is large with respect to meson size .",
    "our small physical system sizes are therefore large enough to extract @xmath101 and finite size effects for this quantity are accurately described by eq .  .",
    "they are not enough to describe the effects of massive quarks , though .",
    "this indicates that the nature of finite size effects is different for the two terms in eq .  .",
    "indeed , a naive application of the method described in this paper for @xmath105 yields values for the mass gaps very close to the ones in the massless case , i.e. @xmath101 is reproduced correctly , but @xmath104 is not .",
    "a possible solution is then to keep away from the continuum limit ( work at much smaller @xmath38 ) , such that the lattice spacing is coarse enough and the physical extent of the lattice is large with respect to the meson size .",
    "this allows to truncate sce at some small order @xmath106 ( with no or very few flux loops ) , which is then enough to saturate the ground state energy and mass gaps .",
    "this , however , makes it necessary to perform a long extrapolation to the continuum limit and the amazing precision of the final result is lost .",
    "our analysis of the massive case will be presented elsewhere .",
