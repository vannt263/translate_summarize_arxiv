    "spectra of type 1 agn show a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines that provide direct insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized , and otherwise excited , gas in the vicinity of the putative central massive object .",
    "broad emission lines , like much studied h@xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z10 ) , are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole ( log m@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "h@xmath0 shows a diversity of line widths as well as profile shifts and asymmetries @xcite . despite this diversity",
    "some systematics have emerged and are best highlighted via the concept of two type 1 agn populations @xcite .",
    "population a show the smallest broad - line widths fwhm h@xmath0=1000 - 4000 and includes the narrow line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) sources ( fwhm @xmath3 2000 ) .",
    "a h@xmath0 profiles are currently best fit by a single lorentz function .",
    "population b sources show fwhm h@xmath0=4000 - 12000 and require two gaussians ( one unshifted and one redshifted ) for a reasonable profile description .",
    "`` broad - line '' h@xmath0 profiles as narrow as fwhm = 500 @xcite and as broad as fwhm = 40000 @xcite have been found .",
    "a is predominantly radio - quiet while pop .",
    "b involves a mix of radio - quiet and the majority of radio - loud quasars .",
    "broad- and narrow - line profile shifts are known and the phenomenology can be confusing .",
    "narrow emission lines like [ oiii]5007 are regarded as a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame except in the case of `` blue outliers '' , usually found in sources with fwhm h@xmath0= 1500 - 3500 and weak [ oiii ] @xcite .",
    "blue outliers show [ oiii ] blueshifts as large as @xmath41000 . no pop .",
    "b sources with blueshifted [ oiii ] are known at low z ( or luminosity ) . careful use of [ oiii ] and h@xmath0 narrow line as rest frame measures suggests that broad h@xmath0 in pop .",
    "a sources rarely shows a systematic red or blue shift above the fwhm profile level . a blueshifted component or asymmetry",
    "is observed in some extreme feii strong pop . a sources @xcite .",
    "b sources show more complex line shift properties .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile usually shows two components : 1 ) a `` classical '' broad component ( bc ; fwhm = 4000  5000 ) with zero or small ( red or blue ) shift , and 2 ) a very broad ( vbc ; 10000 ) and redshifted ( @xmath51000 ) component .",
    "composites involving the 469 brightest sdss - dr5 quasars suggest that these two components represent the underlying stable structure of h@xmath0 in pop .",
    "b sources .",
    "broad feii emission has been found in type 1 quasars since the era of photographic spectroscopy in the 60s .",
    "feii emission blends are almost ubiquitous in a sample of the brightest ( usually highest s / n ) sdss quasars ( z10 ) .",
    "circumstantial evidence has accumulated supporting the assumption that feii emission arises in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low ionization lines like h@xmath0 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fwhm feii appears to correlate with fwhm h@xmath0  over the full range where feii can be detected ( fwhm=1000 - 12000 ) .",
    "this can be clearly seen at low @xmath6  by observing the shape ( e.g. , smoothness ) of the feii 4450 - 4700   blue blend ( and the feii multiplet 42 line at 5018  ) near [ oiii]5007 . in pop .",
    "a sources the blend resolves into individual lines while it becomes much smoother in pop .",
    "b sources . sources with the strongest feii emission also show a weakening of h@xmath0 emission as expected if the latter is collisionally quenched in the same dense medium where strong feii emission can be produced @xcite .",
    "obviously systematic line shifts place important constraints on models for the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region .",
    "the most famous example involves a systematic blueshift of high ionization lines ( e.g. , civ 1549 ) relative to low ionization lines ( e.g. , balmer ) especially in pop . a sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "evidence was recently advanced ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h08 ) for the existence of a _",
    "systematic _ redshift of feii relative to [ oiii]5007 ( and hence the balmer lines ) in a majority of type 1 quasars .",
    "this result , along with a narrower estimated feii line width , has been ascribed to feii emission arising in a region with dynamics dominated by infall and located at larger radius than the region producing the bulk of h@xmath0 .",
    "h08 argue that the amplitude of the shifts correlates inversely with source eddington ratio ( l / l@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "interpretations for such an feii redshift have already appeared @xcite reflecting the potential importance of such a first - order kinematic signature .",
    "having worked on line spectra and profile shifts for many years we were surprised by the h08 claims and decided to test the hypothesis of a systematic feii redshift .",
    "could we have missed it ?",
    "first let us consider what we know .",
    "a quasars show relatively symmetric unshifted lorentz - like h@xmath0 profiles with fwhm@xmath34000 . in our work using the brightest ( @xmath10 17.5 or @xmath11 17.5 ; @xcite ) sdss dr5 quasars we processed spectra for @xmath4260 pop . a sources ( from a sample of 469 quasars ; z10 ) and we found no evidence for a systematic shift of feii lines relative to h@xmath0 or .",
    "such an feii shift should be easiest to detect in the brightest pop . a sdss spectra with narrowest broad - line profiles and strongest feii emission .",
    "it is immediately suspicious that more and larger feii redshifts are claimed for pop .",
    "b sources . in only one pop .",
    "a source in our sample sdss j0946 + 0139 do we find a large h@xmath0 peak ( 90@xmath12 intensity level ) redshift of 1830 .",
    "this source is similar to oq208 ( @xcite and discussed in h08 ) which shows @xmath13 @xmath142000 .",
    "sdss j0946 is the only pop .",
    "a source with a large feii redshift in our z10 sample ( 1/260 ) .",
    "z10 found 19 quasars with an h@xmath0 peak ( 9/10 fractional intensity ) blueshifted more than -320 and 4 sources with the peak redshift more than + 320 . the remaining 241 pop .",
    "a sources showed no significant h@xmath0  peak shift ( figure 8 of z10 ) .",
    "best feii template fits to these sources show no significant difference in centroid redshift between feii and h@xmath0 .",
    "there are two possible causes of small and spurious h@xmath0 ( or feii ) shifts : 1 ) host galaxy contamination and 2 ) blue outliers.except in rare cases host galaxy contamination is unlikely to induce systematic redshifts with the amplitudes reported by h08 .",
    "extreme blue outliers with [ oiii ] blueshifts in the range 400 - 1000 are rare and therefore can not be the cause of the large and systematic shifts reported in h08 .",
    "in fact h08 selection criteria rejected sources likely to be seriously affected by 1 ) or 2 ) .",
    "h08 chose 4000 + sources from sdss dr5 with computed s / n @xmath15 10 .",
    "z10 also used dr5 where @xmath494% of sources show s / n @xmath15 10 .",
    "our sample was magnitude - limited with a slightly shallower redshift upper limit ( z=0.7 instead of 0.8 ) .",
    "why do we reach different conclusions about feii shifts ?",
    "a big part of the answer could involve how s / n was computed .",
    "compute s / n over the range 44305500@xmath16 .",
    "this procedure overestimates the quality of the data because it includes major emission lines in the computation .",
    "we compute s / n in the range 5600 - 5800@xmath16 , which is free of strong lines and represents as close as one can approach to an estimate of continuum s / n near h@xmath0 . using our range the h08 sample shows mean and median s / n values of 10.6 and 7.4 , respectively ; approx .",
    "65% show s /",
    "n @xmath3 10 .",
    "we find that only 182 spectra of our bright sample are included in the h08 s . the majority of the h08 s sources are lower s / n than those in our sample .",
    "one can not estimate reliable feii line shifts using individual sdss spectra for sources fainter than about g@xmath417 - 17.5 . in rough order of importance",
    "our studies indicate that the accuracy of feii shift measures depends on : 1 ) feii strength and feii / h@xmath0  profile widths , 2 ) spectral s / n and 3 ) if estimates depend heavily on fits to the 4430 - 4680   blend , strength of heii 4686 emission . typical individual spectra used by h08 _ show _ too low s / n to allow convincing conclusions about feii shift and width  typical parameter uncertainties for individual sources are much larger than the ones connected with our high s / n composites ( for a typical a2 source with s / n@xmath1720 uncertainties of shift estimates are larger than @xmath181500 ) .",
    "individual source spectra with large quoted feii redshift and s / n near the sample median were extracted from the h08 sample and specfit modelled . using an feii template with fixed shifts ranging from zero up to the largest values quoted by h08",
    ", @xmath19 can not distinguish between zero and e.g. , 1000 redshift in the majority of the sources .",
    "the best recourse is to generate high s / n composite spectra .",
    "h08 argue that one can not confirm or refute the existence of a systematic feii redshift using composite spectra because of the large dispersion of fwhm , shifts and flux values for both h@xmath0 and feii .",
    "this is likely true for composites generated from random subsamples of sources but not true if one generates composites over more limited ranges of parameter values .",
    "one can generate binned composites over limited ranges of fwhm h@xmath0 and feii strength using the 4de1 formalism ( @xcite ; z10 ) .",

    ". specfit analysis ( @xcite ; details in @xcite ) of an a2 median composite involving n = 130 z10 sources ( s / n  90 ) gives a best - fit consistent with zero feii redshift .",
    "the situation for the b1 composite ( n=131 sources from z10 ; s / n  110 ) is less constraining because lines are broader and feii weaker .",
    "table 1 reports feii template shifts and 2@xmath21  uncertainties for specfit tests discussed in this paper .",
    "we also report peak shifts of  bc extracted from the best specfit solutions along with  `` core '' shifts measured at the centroid of the line peak after  nc subtraction . in no case",
    "do we find a significant shift between feii and the rest frame or between feii and .",
    "we also do not find any significant feii shifts if we restrict to sources with l / l@xmath7 ratio @xmath22  ( h08 suggested the shifts might be largest for low l / l@xmath7 sources ) .      since we find no evidence for systematic feii redshifts in our z10 bright quasar sample composites it is useful to generate feii shift composites using the h08 sample .",
    "we generate them within the 4de1 context thereby restricting the ranges of fwhm h@xmath0 , feii relative strength ( and likely also fwhm feii ) for each composite .",
    "since the distribution of feii shifts shown in h08 is continuous we focus on the sources with largest quoted shift values .",
    "if these shifts are not confirmed then smaller shifts are even less likely to be real .",
    "we therefore focus on constructing median composites for all h08 sources falling in 4de1 bins a2 and b1 with h08 feii redshift estimates @xmath23  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "two composites were constructed for each spectra bin : 1 ) one with no restriction on feii width ( h08 do not constrain fwhm feii in their template fits so it is sometimes very different from fwhm h@xmath0 ) and 2 ) one with feii width constrained to the fwhm range of h@xmath0  in a particular bin ( i.e. , @xmath24  for a2 and @xmath25  for b1 ) .",

    "one can see a clear preference for zero or near - zero fits .",
    "the significance of @xmath26 variations is described by @xmath30  statistics appropriate for ratios of @xmath26  values @xcite . given the large number of degrees of freedoms in the sampling range ( 4500  4630 , 5040  5090 , 5310  5360  ) any @xmath26  differences between two fits become significant at a 95%  confidence level if @xmath31 .",

    "note especially the fits to the two relatively isolated multiplet 42 feii lines between h@xmath0 and [ oiii]4959 and on the red wing of [ oiii]5007 .",
    "the redshifted fit fails to include the blue side of the 4450  4700 blend and the red side is confused by the frequent presence of heii 4686 .",
    "the latter line is not mentioned in the h08 study leaving us to conclude that it was not included in their fits .",
    "it can certainly give the impression of a redshift of the feii blue blend , which is the most useful feii diagnostic in the optical spectra of low redshift quasars ( the red feii blend is frequently affected by coronal lines as well as mgii host galaxy absorption in lower redshift sources )",
    ". pioneering principal component analysis of the bqs survey @xcite found that heii4686 equivalent width anticorrelates with sources luminosity ( it is eigenvector 2 ) . there is a tendency for the h08 sources with largest feii redshifts to favor a smaller and lower ( @xmath33 ) range of source luminosity than those with near zero shifts ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the fit to the 4430  4680 blue blend drives the best fit @xmath19 results .",
    "the exclusion of heii4686 from the h08 fits likely results in a tendency for heii to `` redshift '' the blue feii blend .",
