    "reliable microscopic calculation of nuclear state densities of heavy nuclei is a challenging task because it often requires the inclusion of correlations beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "correlation effects can be taken into account in the context of the configuration - interaction ( ci ) shell model approach , but the size of the required model space in heavy nuclei is prohibitively large for direct diagonalization of the ci shell model hamiltonian .",
    "this limitation can be overcome in part by using the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite .",
    "the smmc method enables the calculations of statistical nuclear properties , and in particular of level densities in very large model spaces  @xcite .",
    "fermionic monte carlo methods are often hampered by the so - called sign problem , which leads to large and uncontrollable fluctuations of observables at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "statistical and collective properties of nuclei can be reliably calculated  @xcite by employing a class of interactions that have a good monte carlo sign in the grand - canonical formulation  @xcite .",
    "the projection on an even number of particles keeps the good sign of the interaction , allowing accurate calculations for even - even nuclei .",
    "however , the projection on an odd number of particles leads to a new sign problem , making it difficult to calculate thermal observables at low temperatures for odd - even and odd - odd nuclei . in particular , the ground - state energy of the odd - particle system can not be extracted from direct smmc calculations .",
    "a method to extract the ground - state energy of the odd - particle system from the imaginary - time green s functions of the even - particle system was recently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied successfully to medium - mass nuclei . however , the application of this method to heavy nuclei is computationally intensive and requires additional development . in this work ,",
    "we describe a practical method that enables us to determine the ground - state energy using a complete set of experimentally known low - lying levels and the neutron resonance data at the neutron threshold energy .",
    "we then extend the recent smmc state density calculations of even - even nuclei in the rare - earth region  @xcite to include odd - even isotope chains of @xmath0sm and @xmath1nd .",
    "we find close agreement with the state densities that are extracted from experimental data .",
    "in rare - earth nuclei we use the model space of refs .",
    "@xcite spanned by the single - particle orbitals @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for protons , and the orbitals @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for neutrons .",
    "we have chosen these orbitals by the requirement that their occupation probabilities in well - deformed nuclei be between 0.9 and 0.1 .",
    "the effect of other orbitals is accounted for by the renormalization of the interaction .",
    "the bare single - particle energies in the shell - model hamiltonian are obtained so as to reproduce the single - particle energies in a spherical woods - saxon plus spin - orbit potential in the spherical hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the effective interaction consists of monopole pairing and multipole - multipole terms  @xcite @xmath14 where the pair creation operator @xmath15 and the multipole operator @xmath16 are given by    @xmath17    @xmath18^{(\\lambda)}\\ ] ]    with @xmath19 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , @xmath20 denotes normal ordering and @xmath21 represents the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the pairing strengths is expressed as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a renormalization factor and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are parametrized to reproduce the experimental odd - even mass differences for nearby spherical nuclei in the number - projected bcs approximation  @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole , octupole and hexadecupole interaction terms have strengths given by @xmath26 for @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the paprameter @xmath28 is determined self - consistently  @xcite and @xmath29 are renormalization factors accounting for core polarization effects .",
    "we use the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath23 and @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    [ eq : params ]    while the other parameters are fixed at @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "because of the sign problem introduced by the projection on an odd number of particles , the thermal energy @xmath35 of the odd - even samarium and neodymium isotopes can in practice be calculated only up to @xmath36 mev@xmath37 . for comparison ,",
    "smmc calculations in the neighboring even - even samarium and neodymium nuclei , for which there is no sign problem , were carried out up to @xmath38 mev@xmath37  @xcite .",
    "systematic errors introduced by the discretization of @xmath39  @xcite , are corrected by calculating @xmath35 for the two time slices of @xmath40 mev@xmath37 and @xmath41 mev@xmath37 and then performing a linear extrapolation to @xmath42 . for @xmath43 mev@xmath44 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath45 is weaker and an average value was taken instead .",
    "the calculations for @xmath46 mev@xmath44 were carried out using a stabilization method of the one - body canonical propagator  @xcite for a given configuration of the auxiliary fields .    since our calculations of the thermal energy @xmath35",

    "here we extract @xmath48 by performing a one - parameter fit of the smmc thermal excitation energy @xmath49 to the experimental thermal energy .",
    "the latter is calculated using the thermodynamical relation @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the experimental partition function in which the energy is measured relative to the ground state ( see below ) .",

    "we calculated the experimental partition function ( right panel , dashed line ) from @xmath54 where @xmath55 denote the excitation energies of the experimentally known energy levels .",
    "the incompleteness of the level counting data above a certain excitation energy leads to a saturation of the experimental partition function and the corresponding average experimental thermal energy ( left panel , dashed line ) above @xmath56 mev . in order to determine the ground - state energy @xmath48 from a fit of the smmc thermal energy to the experimental data",

    "this can be accomplished by calculating an empirical partition function @xmath59 where the discrete sum is carried out over a suitably chosen complete set of @xmath60 experimental levels up to an excitation energy @xmath61 , and the contribution of higher - lying levels is included effectively through the integral over an empirical level density with a boltzmann weight .",
    "the empirical state density is parametrized by the back - shifted bethe formula ( bbf )  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the single - particle level density parameter and @xmath64 is the backshift parameter . for these parameters we use the values in ref .",
    "@xcite determined from level counting data ( at low excitation energies ) and the @xmath65-wave neutron resonance data ( at the neutron resonance threshold ) for the given nucleus of interest . the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : ze ] are calculated using eq .",

    "the number of the low - lying states @xmath60 ( determining @xmath61 ) are chosen such that the solid and dashed curves for the experimental partition function merge smoothly at sufficiently low temperatures .",

    "nevertheless , we see that both the smmc partition function and thermal energy fit very well the corresponding experimental quantities over a range of temperatures .",

    "this average density is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the entropy and @xmath69 is the heat capacity in the canonical ensemble . in smmc",
    "we first calculate the thermal energy as an observable @xmath70 and the integrate the thermodynamic relation @xmath71 to find the partition function @xmath72 .",
