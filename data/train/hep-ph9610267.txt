    "heavy - quark production in the @xmath2 colliding - beam experiments with desy hera offers a novel way of testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "first results for the charm - quark photoproduction cross section @xmath3 were presented by zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite , and compared with a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation @xcite . in this calculation , the massive - charm scheme has been adopted , in which the charm - quark mass @xmath4 acts as a cutoff and sets the scale for the perturbative calculation .",
    "the cross section factorizes into a partonic hard - scattering cross section multiplied by light - quark and gluon densities @xcite . in this factorization approach ,",
    "the only quarks inside the proton and the photon are the light ones .",
    "thus , in the massive - charm scheme , the number of active flavours in the initial state is @xmath5 , while the massive charm quark appears only in the final state . for the prediction of the total charm photoproduction cross section , for which experimental results from hera were presented in @xcite ,",
    "this is the only possibility .",
    "actually , @xmath6  gev is not very large compared to @xmath7 , so that the validity of this approach is not obvious .    with the advent of new measurements , by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite , of the differential cross section @xmath8 of inclusive @xmath1 production , where @xmath9 and @xmath0 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the @xmath1 mesons , respectively",
    ", we have the possibility to test the theory in a different regime of scales .",
    "the experimental differential cross sections extend up to @xmath10  gev , so that , in contrast to the total - cross - section calculations , @xmath0 rather than @xmath11 should be considered as the large scale .",
    "then , in nlo , terms proportional to @xmath12 arise from collinear gluon emission by charm quarks or from almost collinear branching of gluons or photons into charm - anticharm pairs .",
    "for large enough @xmath0 , these terms are bound to spoil the convergence of the perturbative series and cause large scale dependences of the nlo result at @xmath13 .",
    "the proper procedure in the regime @xmath13 is to absorb the terms proportional to @xmath12 into the charm distribution functions of the incoming photon and proton and into the fragmentation functions ( ff s ) of charm quarks into charmed hadrons . of course , to perform this absorption , one needs information on the charm contribution in the parton density functions ( pdf s ) and ff s .",
    "an alternative way of making reliable predictions at large @xmath0 is to treat the charm quarks as massless partons .",
    "the collinear singularities corresponding to the @xmath12 terms of the massive - charm scheme are then absorbed into the charm - quark pdf s and ff s in the same way as for the lighter @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks .",
    "this massless approach was proposed in @xcite and first applied to the production of large-@xmath0 hadrons containing bottom quarks in @xmath17 collisions by lampe @xcite and by cacciari and greco @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was employed in two independent studies of charm - quark photoproduction @xcite . in these two investigations , the @xmath9 and @xmath0 distributions in the massless and massive approaches",
    "were compared with each other , making different assumptions concerning the initial state as well as the ff s in the massless approach . in @xcite ,",
    "low-@xmath18 electroproduction was considered , while @xcite was concerned with photoproduction with fixed photon energy . in @xcite ,",
    "the ff of the charm quark into charmed hadrons was approximated by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scaled momentum of the charmed hadron @xmath21 , whereas the authors of @xcite employed the perturbative ff s ( pff s ) of @xcite , which they evolved from the starting scale @xmath11 to the appropriate higher scales of order @xmath0 according to the usual altarelli - parisi evolution equations .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to remove the restriction to a scale - independent @xmath22-type ff of the charm quark made in our previous study with krmer @xcite and to adopt more realistic descriptions of charm - quark fragmentation , including evolution to higher scales .",
    "having extensively compared the massless and massive approaches in @xcite , we shall now focus our attention on the massless approach , which is likely to be more reliable in the large-@xmath0 range , in which we are primarily interested here .",
    "specifically , we shall consider the following models of charm - quark fragmentation : ( i ) @xmath22-function - type ff without evolution @xcite for reference ; ( ii ) pff @xcite with and without evolution ; and ( iii ) peterson fragmentation @xcite with evolution .",
    "choice ( iii ) will be considered as the most realistic one and will be used for comparisons with the recent h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite data .",
    "the outline of our work is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shall shortly describe the basic formalism of charm - quark fragmentation , discuss the transition from massless to massive factorization of final - state collinear singularities , and specify our assumptions concerning choices ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) . in section  3",
    ", we shall investigate numerically the differences between the various implementations of charm - quark fragmentation discussed in section  2 .",
    "there , we also confront our final predictions based on the peterson ff with the h1 and zeus data .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we describe the underlying assumptions for the massless approach , making various choices for the ff s of the ( anti)charm quark into @xmath1 mesons .",
    "as is well known , two mechanisms contribute to the photoproduction of charm quarks in @xmath2 collisions : ( i ) in the direct photoproduction mechanism , the photon couples directly to the quarks , which , besides the massless @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks , also include the massless @xmath23 quark . in this case",
    ", no spectator particles travel along the momentum direction of the photon .",
    "( ii ) in the resolved photoproduction mechanism , the photon splits up into a flux of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath23 quarks and gluons , which then interact with the partons coming from the proton leading to the production of charm quarks at large @xmath0 .",
    "the contributing parton - level processes are the same as in the case of charm - quark production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the charm quark is accompanied by a spectator jet in the photon direction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath24 cross section depends not only on the pdf s of the proton but also on those of the photon .",
    "the main difference relative to the usually considered massive - charm scheme is that the charm quark also contributes via the pdf s of the proton and photon , i.e.  charm is already an active flavour in the initial state . in other words",
    ", there is no essential difference between the treatment of the truly light quarks @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the charm quark in the initial state .",
    "this approach is justified if a large scale is governing the production process . in our case , this is the @xmath0 of the @xmath1 mesons , with @xmath13 . in this region , non - singular mass terms are suppressed in the cross sections by powers of @xmath25 .",
    "the important mass terms appear if the virtuality of the charm quark is small .",
    "this happens in the initial state if the charm quark is emitted from the proton or photon , and in the final state if the partons emit a @xmath26 pair .",
    "these two contributions lead to the @xmath12 terms in the massive scheme . in our massless approach",
    ", they are summed into the scale - dependent pdf s and ff s of charm quarks into @xmath1 mesons .",
    "thus , when we proceed to nlo , the following steps are taken : ( i ) the hard - scattering cross section for the direct- and resolved - photon processes are calculated in the massless approximation with @xmath27 active flavours .",
    "the collinear singularities are subtracted according to the @xmath28 scheme . since the charm quark is taken to be massless , the singularities from its splittings are subtracted as well .",
    "\\(ii ) the charm quark is accommodated in the pdf s of the proton and photon as a light flavour .",
    "the finite mass of the charm quark is taken into account by including it in the evolution in such a way that its pdf s are only non - vanishing above a scale set by its mass .",
    "\\(iii ) the ff s characterize the hadronization of the massless partons , including the charm quark , into mesonic or baryonic states containing the charm quark . in our case , these are the @xmath1 mesons . similarly to the fragmentation into light mesons , these ff s are basically non - perturbative input and must be determined by experiment , for example from the cross section of inclusive @xmath1 production in @xmath29 annihilation @xcite .",
    "this information determines the ff s at some starting scale , @xmath30 .",
    "an alternative that exploits the fact that the charm mass satisfies @xmath4 is the calculation of universal starting conditions for the ff s within perturbative qcd at a scale @xmath30 of order @xmath11 .",
    "the ff s thus obtained are the pff s mentioned above . in @xcite ,",
    "these starting conditions were calculated at nlo in the @xmath28 scheme .",
    "they read @xmath31 \\right\\}_+ , \\nonumber\\\\ d_g^d(x,\\mu_0)&{\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}={\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}&d_g^{\\bar d}(x,\\mu_0 ) = \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)}{2\\pi}t_f[x^2+(1-x)^2]\\ln\\frac{\\mu_0 ^ 2}{m^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the normalization of these ff s is such that @xmath21 stands for the sum of all hadrons with a @xmath23 quark . to obtain the ff into a specific charmed meson , for example the @xmath40",
    ", we must include the branching ratio @xmath41 .",
    "\\(iv ) for the higher scales @xmath42 , the pdf s , the non - perturbative ff s and the pff s are evolved in nlo up to the chosen factorization scale ( which we take to be of order @xmath0 ) via the altarelli - parisi equations and convoluted with the nlo hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the charm - quark mass @xmath11 then only enters in terms of the starting conditions of the pdf s and ff s .",
    "as already mentioned , the large logarithmic terms proportional to @xmath43 , which appear in the massive scheme , are resummed in this approach . to be specific ,",
    "they are effectively split into two parts .",
    "one part proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is some generic factorization scale , appears in the hard - scattering cross sections having no dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "this part may be kept small by choosing @xmath46 .",
    "the other part , proportional to @xmath47 , is absorbed into the pdf s and ff s .",
    "the logarithm @xmath48 , which is large if @xmath49 and @xmath46 , is incorporated via the evolution equations and therefore resummed .",
    "the residual term proportional to @xmath50 , connected with the starting conditions in ( [ eqpff ] ) , is treated with fixed - order perturbation theory in the case of the pff s , or is part of the non - perturbative input in the case of general ff s .",
    "the pff s given in terms of the starting conditions ( [ eqpff ] ) suggest some simplifications which we consider as reasonable approximations for the pff s .",
    "the dominant term in ( [ eqpff ] ) is the @xmath22 function expressing the fact that , due to @xmath4 , the charm quark transforms into the charmed hadron having the same momentum , any binding effect of the light quark of order @xmath7 being neglected .",
    "the approximation @xmath51 , denoted @xmath52 for later use , was considered in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "this approximation neglects the important @xmath48 terms induced in the ff s through the evolution .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we shall choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the transverse mass of the produced hadron .",
    "approximation @xmath56 consists of keeping all terms in ( [ eqpff ] ) , but with the replacement @xmath57 .",
    "this approximation includes the large @xmath47 terms to fixed order in @xmath58 , i.e.  not in the resummed form because the ff s are not evolved up to the scale @xmath45 via the evolution equations . except for the fact that the proton and photon pdf s still have four active flavours , this approximation is , from the conceptual point of view , most closely related to the massive scheme @xcite , in the sense that the important mass terms of the massive calculation , namely the logarithmic ones related to the collinear would - be singularities , are properly included , while the non - singular power terms in @xmath25 are omitted .",
    "we stress that the latter are indispensible if @xmath0 is of order @xmath11 , and must be included if total cross sections are to be calculated ; approximation @xmath56 is then bound to break down . however , our goal is to improve the theoretical description at @xmath13 .",
    "since , in case @xmath56 , the ff s are not evolved to higher scales according to the evolution equations , the terms proportional to @xmath58 in ( [ eqpff ] ) may be shifted to the hard - scattering cross section , which we actually choose to do .",
    "in fact , case @xmath56 may be viewed as a change of factorization scheme , in the sense that the factorization of the final - state collinear singularities associated with the charm quark is adjusted so as to match the finite-@xmath11 calculation .",
    "this is an equivalent interpretation of the matching procedure proposed in @xcite between the massless - charm calculation in connection with the pff s and the massive - charm calculation without ff s .",
    "specifically , we substitute in the hard - scattering cross sections @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the timelike lo @xmath61 splitting functions @xcite and @xmath62 may be gleaned from ( [ eqpff ] ) : @xmath63 \\right\\}_+ \\nonumber\\\\ & { \\hspace*{-2.5mm}}={\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}&-p_{qq}^{(0,t)}(x)\\ln\\frac{\\mu_0 ^ 2}{m^2 } + c_f\\left\\{-2\\delta(1-x)+2\\left(\\frac{1}{1-x}\\right)_+ + 4\\left[\\frac{\\ln(1-x)}{1-x}\\right]_+\\right .",

    "the @xmath64 functions emerge by charge conjugation .",
    "since the pff s of ( [ eqpff ] ) refer to the @xmath28 factorization scheme for the collinear singularities associated with outgoing massless - charm lines , so do the @xmath65 functions of ( [ eqdij ] ) . in case @xmath56",
    ", @xmath66 is large .",
    "leaving aside the terms in ( [ eqdij ] ) that are not enhanced by this logarithm , case @xmath56 obviously amounts to choosing the final - state factorization scale in the massless - charm hard - scattering cross sections to be @xmath67 and omitting the @xmath65 functions , i.e.  to choosing the final - state factorization scale in case @xmath52 to be @xmath67 . in our implementation of case @xmath56",
    ", we have @xmath51 for all factorization scales @xmath45 , just as in case @xmath52 .    obviously , case @xmath56 may be refined by resumming the large logarithms @xmath43 via evolution . to this end , in case @xmath68",
    ", we take @xmath69 as the input distribution at the starting scale @xmath30 for the nlo evolution up to @xmath45 . at the same time",
    ", we keep the @xmath65 functions , with the large logarithm stripped off , i.e.  with @xmath30 now of order @xmath11 rather than @xmath0 , in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "an alternative refinement of case @xmath56 may be obtained by taking the full pff distributions of ( [ eqpff ] ) as input for the evolution up to scale @xmath45 , and convoluting the outcome with the massless - charm hard - scattering cross sections ( without @xmath65 functions ) .",
    "this approach , which we denote by @xmath21 , corresponds to the pff approach advocated in @xcite for inclusive heavy - quark production via @xmath29 annihilation .",
    "it was applied to inclusive bottom - quark production in @xmath17 collisions in @xcite and to inclusive charm - quark production in @xmath24 and @xmath70 collisions in @xcite , respectively .    however , it is not at all clear that the pff s give the correct description for the fragmentation of the charm quark into charmed hadrons , since the charm quark is only moderately heavy .",
    "although the average value @xmath71 near @xmath72 is not precisely known , it is bound to be @xmath73 .",
    "most measurements of @xmath71 are at larger scales . in the case of @xmath74",

    "therefore , the distribution by peterson et al .",

    "note that ( [ eqpssz ] ) turns into a @xmath22 function in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "we choose @xmath84 , which is the central value obtained in @xcite for charm quarks . in case @xmath85 ,",
    "we adopt ( [ eqpssz ] ) with @xmath86 so that @xmath87 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "one has @xmath88 .",
    "this simplifies the comparison with the fragmentation models @xmath52@xmath21 . in section  3.4 , where we compare our predictions with the hera data , we must adjust the normalization of our calculation by including the measured branching fraction @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the peterson ff for @xmath74 fragmentation of ( [ eqpssz ] ) has also been used in @xcite for calculating the production of @xmath1 mesons in @xmath24 collisions based on the purely massive scheme . in our approach , we need the evolved ff s at the scale @xmath45 , with ( [ eqpssz ] ) describing the input at the starting scale @xmath30 .",
    "we solve the evolution equations using moments in mellin space .",
    "for the reader s convenience , the moments of ( [ eqpssz ] ) are listed in appendix  a. they are expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions of complex arguments , which are conveniently calculated from appropriate series expansions , also written down in appendix  a. to account for the fact that the peterson ff describes the transition from a massive charm quark into a physical @xmath40 meson , whereas , for reasons explained in the introduction , we work with hard - scattering cross sections where the charm quark is treated as a massless flavour , we incorporate the @xmath65 functions of ( [ eqdij ] ) in our analysis just as we do in case @xmath68 .",
    "this means that case @xmath85 emerges from case @xmath68 by replacing the @xmath22-function - type input distribution at scale @xmath30 with the peterson formula of ( [ eqpssz ] ) .",
    "an alternative approach would be to include the terms relating the massless and massive schemes in the evolution of the ff as we do in version @xmath21 , where we evolve the full pff s of ( [ eqpff ] ) .",
    "in other words , one would convolute the pff s with the peterson formula  ( [ eqpssz ] ) at the scale @xmath30 , evolve these modified initial distributions at nlo up to the scale @xmath45 and employ the ff s thus obtained in the usual massless - charm @xmath28 analysis ( without @xmath65 functions ) . in the following",
    ", this possible alternative for scheme @xmath85 will be called scheme @xmath89 .",
    "both of these schemes properly resum the large logarithmic terms of the type @xmath48 which emerge from ( [ eqpff ] ) as @xmath30 is driven up to @xmath45 . in scheme @xmath85 ,",
    "just the latter logarithms get resummed , while the non - logarithmic terms of ( [ eqpff ] ) are treated in fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "by contrast , in scheme @xmath89 , also these non - logarithmic terms are included in the evolution .",
    "scheme @xmath85 is minimal in the sense that is allows us to include in the evolution just the long - distance part of the @xmath74 fragmentation process , which is encoded in the peterson ansatz  ( [ eqpssz ] ) .",
    "we shall adopt scheme @xmath85 whenever we confront theoretical predictions with hera data . in the limit @xmath83 , cases @xmath85 and @xmath89",
    "coincide with cases @xmath68 and @xmath21 , respectively . for a given value of @xmath82 ,",
    "one expects the difference between schemes @xmath85 and @xmath89 to be similar to the one between schemes @xmath68 and @xmath21 .",
    "since schemes @xmath68 and @xmath21 do not yield physical observables , their difference is phenomenologically inconsequential . by the same token , it is unreasonable to expect that a cross section evaluated in schemes @xmath68 or @xmath21 should coincide with the corresponding charm - quark production cross section obtained in the all - massive scheme . in the case of @xmath1 photoproduction , this is even more apparent , since the cross sections of schemes @xmath68 and @xmath21 exhibit a significant sensitivity to the charm content of the resolved photon ( intrinsic charm ) , which does not enter the all - massive calculation at all .",
    "on the other hand , the difference between schemes @xmath85 and @xmath89 is to be compensated by a corresponding shift in the @xmath82 parameter of ( [ eqpssz ] ) , i.e.  @xmath82 is scheme dependent at nlo .",
    "for instance , if one wishes to use the value of @xmath82 determined through a nlo fit to @xmath29 data as input for a nlo prediction of photoproduction , one has to make sure that both analyses are carried out in the same scheme .",
    "only then , one may obtain a coherent description of high - energy @xmath29 data and high-@xmath0 @xmath2 data .",
    "we emphasize that , on the basis of an all - massive calculation including fragmentation , this can not be achieved in any meaningful way , due to the presence of sizeable logarithms at fixed order .",
    "a consistent procedure within the all - massive framework would be to determine @xmath82 from a nlo fit to low - energy @xmath29 data on inclusive @xmath1 production , which has not been done so far .    a second alternative to",
    "case @xmath85 has been adopted in @xcite to describe charmed - meson production at the tevatron . in @xcite",
    ", the evolved pff s are convoluted with some unevolved @xmath90 distribution of the form @xmath91 .",

    "we conclude from this study that the evolution of the ff must be fully taken into account in order to obtain realistic predictions for the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the unevolved @xmath22-function fragmentation considered in @xcite ( case @xmath52 ) is unreliable for large @xmath0 .    in @xcite ,",
    "case @xmath52 was compared with the massive nlo calculation , adopting the previous zeus conditions , which are very similar to the present ones used here .",
    "the massive nlo result turned out to be roughly 45% of the case-@xmath52 result . on the other hand , from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that , at @xmath123  gev ( 12  gev ) , the case-@xmath56 result amounts to 67% ( 54% ) of the case-@xmath52 result . in other words , at @xmath123  gev ( 12  gev ) , the massive nlo result is roughly 2/3 ( 5/6 ) of the case-@xmath56 result .",
    "this may be partly attributed to the negative contribution from the power terms in @xmath25 , which are not included in case @xmath56 .",
    "the magnitude of these terms rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath0 . on the other hand , in contrast to the massive calculation , case @xmath56 receives contributions from the charm quarks intrinsic to the proton and photon .",
    "these contributions will be investigated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , respectively .",
    "we shall see that the charm content of the photon is particularly important .",
    "the rapidity distributions at @xmath119  gev for the cases @xmath52 , @xmath56 , @xmath68 and @xmath21 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] . for the larger rapidities",
    "@xmath124 , the cross sections for cases @xmath52 , @xmath56 , @xmath68 and @xmath21 almost coincide , i.e.  here the evolution of the ff s has little effect .    in figs .",

    "that is , in the limit @xmath83 , the results of cases @xmath85 and @xmath89 coincide with those of cases @xmath68 and @xmath21 , respectively . as anticipated in section  2 , for finite @xmath82 , the relative difference between cases @xmath85 and @xmath89 is very similar to that between cases @xmath68 and @xmath21 . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0 distributions for cases @xmath85 and @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] converge towards the low-@xmath0 end , where the non - logarithmic terms of the pff s as implemented in case @xmath89 are just mildly affected by the evolution",
    ". the main effect of the peterson ff with finite @xmath82 is to reduce the overall normalization of the respective calculations .    in the following investigations",
    ", we shall stick to case @xmath85 and employ the nlo - evolved peterson ff .",
    "this description of charm fragmentation is more realistic than the pff s because the charm quark is only moderately heavy .",
    "compared with the massive - charm scheme , the massless - charm scheme shows a completely different decomposition of the cross section into direct- and resolved - photon contributions .",
    "this was analysed in detail in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "whereas in the massive approach direct photoproduction is dominant at large @xmath0 , in our massless scheme both contributions are of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath92 at @xmath119  gev .",
    "both cross sections peak approximately at @xmath125 .",
    "the resolved cross section has in addition a shoulder at larger @xmath96 , which originates from the gluon part of the photon pdf s .",
    "the peak at @xmath125 is due to the charm part , as may be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . of course",
    ", we must bear in mind that the decomposition of the photoproduction cross section in direct- and resolved - photon contributions is ambiguous at nlo ; it depends on the factorization scheme and scale , which we take to be the @xmath28 scheme and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "however , the sum of the two contributions is unambiguously defined .",
    "before we compare our results with recent experimental data from h1 and zeus , we investigate several theoretical uncertainties , which might be relevant .",
    "first , we consider the influence of the proton pdf s . in fig .  [ fig4 ] , the cross section @xmath92 at @xmath119  gev is plotted for our standard cteq4 m @xcite proton pdf s and compared with the result obtained using the recent proton pdf set mrs(g ) by the durham group @xcite , with @xmath127  mev .",
    "the cross sections for these two choices are almost identical . from this",
    "we conclude that our predictions are insignificantly influenced through our choice of the proton pdf s . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we also show the influence of the charm distribution inside the proton . if it is taken away from the cteq4 m pdf s , the cross section hardly changes . only for larger @xmath96 , where the cross section is small",
    ", do we see the effect of the charm content of the proton .    a similar study w.r.t .",
    "the photon pdf s is presented in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "here we compare @xmath92 at @xmath119  gev , evaluated with our standard grv photon pdf s , with the calculation based on the recently published new version of the photon pdf s by gordon and storrow @xcite .",
    "the cross sections differ somewhat , by typically 1020% , over the whole @xmath96 range .",
    "this means that very accurate data are needed if the differences between the grv and gs photon pdf s are to be disentangled . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have also plotted the grv prediction with the charm distribution inside the photon put to zero .",
    "this has a dramatic effect . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the curves for the direct - photon contribution and the sum of the direct and resolved contributions are almost identical .",
    "this shows that the resolved cross section is essentially made up by the charm content of the photon . only for @xmath129 , where the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath96 , can we see the effect of the other components of the photon , i.e.the gluon and the light quarks .",
    "therefore charmed - hadron photoproduction at large @xmath0 seems to be an ideal place to learn specifically about the charm content of the photon @xcite , which otherwise can only be studied in charmed - hadron production in large-@xmath18 @xmath130 scattering .",
    "all finite - order perturbative calculations are plagued by scale dependences .",
    "although we may expect that this dependence is reduced in nlo , it is not in general negligible , in particular at moderate @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the cross section @xmath92 at @xmath119  gev for our standard pdf choice and scales @xmath131 with @xmath132 , 1 and 2 . in all these cases , we keep the constraint @xmath53 .",
    "this scale variation produces changes of the cross section of only @xmath133 , which indicates good perturbative stability .",
    "the maximum change occurs where the cross section is maximal .",
    "the main effect is actually due to the variation of the renormalization scale .",
    "in fact , if we stick to @xmath134 , but choose @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 , we observe only a small difference in the cross section ; compare the dotted and full curves in fig .",

    "the cross section for the production of charmed hadrons depends on the choice of ff s .",
    "this was already demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , where we compared the cross sections for different assumptions concerning the ff s .",
    "possibly , the choice @xmath137 in the peterson ff , which we have adopted from @xcite , might not be fully compatible with our procedure . in particular , the value of @xmath82 must depend on the value of the initial scale @xmath30 . up to now",
    ", we have fixed @xmath53 and @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we study how variations in @xmath30 and @xmath82 affect the cross section @xmath92 at @xmath119  gev . if we reduce @xmath30 to @xmath139 keeping @xmath138 , the cross section decreases , as may be seen by comparing the dotted curve with the full one .",
    "this reduction can be compensated by simultaneously adjusting @xmath82 to a smaller value .",
    "the variation of the cross section with @xmath82 may also be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where @xmath140 , 0.06 and 0.08 are considered .",
    "decreasing @xmath82 leads to a larger cross section .",
    "this may be understood by observing that case @xmath68 emerges from case @xmath85 in the limit @xmath83 . in order to obtain definite predictions",
    ", we must use the information on the @xmath82 parameter in connection with a fixed choice for @xmath30 from other @xmath1 production experiments , e.g.  from @xmath141 .",
    "so far , the choice @xmath84 was motivated by chrin s analysis @xcite of charmed - meson production in the petra energy range .",
    "this analysis relied on fragmentation models .",
    "therefore it is unclear whether @xmath84 is the correct choice for the peterson ff at @xmath53 .",
    "we shall come back to this point when we compare our calculation with the experimental data from h1 and zeus .      in this section",

    "we sum over @xmath40 and @xmath95 mesons and adjust the normalization of the peterson ff by including the measured branching fraction @xmath142 @xcite .",

    "the renormalization and factorization scales are chosen to be @xmath131 with @xmath132 ( dashed lines ) , @xmath113 ( solid lines ) and @xmath148 ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "we observe that the scale dependence is small , approximately @xmath133 , indicating that corrections beyond nlo are likely to be negligible .",
    "in all three cases , the agreement with the data is remarkably good , even at small @xmath0 , where we would not have expected it . in our approach ,",
    "the @xmath0 spectra come out somewhat larger than in the all - massive theory @xcite which was used for comparison in @xcite and therefore agree slightly better with the data . in the low-@xmath0 range , this may be partly attributed to the omission of the power terms in @xmath25 in our approach .",
    "it is well known that the rapidity distribution @xmath92 at fixed @xmath0 usually allows for a more stringent test of the theory than @xmath117 .",
    "unfortunately , the measured @xmath96 distributions available so far all correspond to @xmath92 integrated over @xmath0 intervals with rather small lower bounds , namely 2.5  gev@xmath14910  gev in the case of h1 @xcite and 3  gev@xmath14912  gev in the case of zeus @xcite .",
    "the corresponding h1 tagged , h1 untagged and zeus untagged data are compared with our nlo predictions for @xmath132 , 1 and 2 in figs .  [ fig9]a ",
    "c , respectively . the theoretical predictions for",
    "h1 tagged and h1 untagged are quite different .",
    "the curves for the tagged case have their maxima at smaller @xmath96 , close to @xmath150 , and exhibit a much stronger variation with @xmath96 than the curves for the untagged case , which reach their maxima near @xmath151 .",
    "this difference may be understood by observing that the soft end of the equivalent photon spectrum is eliminated in the tagged case by the cut @xmath152 .",
    "the agreement between theory and data is worse than in the case of @xmath117 . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental errors are still rather large .",
    "we observe that in all three cases there is perfect agreement in the central region of the detector , at @xmath153 , whereas in the backward direction the theoretical predictions tend to slightly overshoot data , especially in the case of h1 . in the case of zeus , where the lower cut on @xmath0 is somewhat larger than for h1",
    ", our prediction agrees slightly better with the data than the result of the all - massive calculation presented in fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "however , this observation has to be taken with a grain of salt , since the bulk of the cross section is accumulated at the low-@xmath0 end , where our approach is expected to be less reliable .    in the comparison of the data with our predictions",
    ", we have to keep in mind that the latter depend on the parameter @xmath82 and the starting scale @xmath30 of the peterson ff .",
    "we have chosen @xmath84 and @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we have seen that varying @xmath82 by @xmath154 changes the cross section by @xmath155 , which is comparable to the scale dependence .",
    "we have verified by explicit calculation that the choice @xmath84 in conjunction with @xmath53 yields a satisfactory global fit to the @xmath71 values measured in @xmath29 experiments with cm energies between 10 and 91.2  gev .",
    "we conclude that , at the present stage , the comparison between theory and data is not jeopardized by the uncertainty in @xmath82 .",
    "in this work , we calculated the cross section of inclusive @xmath1-meson production via small-@xmath18 @xmath2 scattering at hera energies on the basis of a new massless - charm approach .",
    "specifically , the @xmath28 factorization of the collinear singularities associated with massless charm quarks in the final state is adjusted so as to match the corresponding massive - charm calculation .",
    "this is implemented in a way similar to switching from the @xmath28 factorization scheme e.g.  to the deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) scheme within the massless analysis .",
    "the fragmentation of the quasi - massive charm quarks into the physical @xmath40 mesons at long distances is then described by the nlo - evolved peterson ff with a suitable choice of @xmath82 at the starting scale @xmath30 .",
    "compared to the all - massive calculation , this has the advantage that the large logarithms @xmath43 are resummed , in particular through the appearance of a much more sizeable resolved - photon contribution .",
    "we believe that this massless - charm scheme is much more suitable in the large-@xmath0 regime .",
    "furthermore , it offers us the opportunity to investigate the charm distribution inside the resolved photon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , which does not enter the all - massive calculation .",
    "we studied various refinements of the massless - charm approach w.r.t .  the description of the @xmath74 fragmentation .",
    "the most realistic fragmentation model , based on the peterson ff evolved through nlo evolution equations from the starting scale @xmath53 up to the characteristic scale of the process , was examined in great detail and used for comparisons with recent data from the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera .",
    "we found good agreement , in particular for the @xmath0 spectra as well as the @xmath96 spectra in the central region .",
    "surprisingly , even at rather low @xmath0 , some of our predictions agree with the data slightly better than those obtained within the all - massive scheme ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig8]c and [ fig9]c with fig .  4 of @xcite ) , which may be an artifact of neglecting the non - singular power terms in @xmath25 .",
    "since our approach is better justified theoretically for @xmath13 , we hope that hera data on inclusive @xmath1 photoproduction in the large-@xmath0 region will soon be available with high statistics .",
    "in particular , @xmath96 spectra with large minimum-@xmath0 cuts would allow for a more stringent test of our fragmentation model in particular and the qcd - improved parton model in general , and increase our understanding of the charm distribution inside the resolved photon .",
    "if one determines @xmath82 from an nlo fit to @xmath29 data , the result will depend on whether scheme @xmath85 or scheme @xmath89 is adopted . according to the factorization theorem ,",
    "this difference is expected to be compensated if one makes nlo predictions for different kinds of experiments as long as one works in the respective scheme . by the same token , nlo predictions based on the all - massive scheme with peterson fragmentation @xcite",
