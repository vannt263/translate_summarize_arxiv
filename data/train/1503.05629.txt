    "fields like fractal analysis have developed in order to obtain dimensional information from a wide range of real world data using quantities like the hausdorff , information and correlation dimensions  @xcite .",
    "one of the problems with these traditional measures of dimension is that they tend to concentrate on the geometric properties of a set while ignoring the statistical origins of the data .",
    "we will give examples where @xmath19 appears to converge to the reciprocal of the hausdorff dimension when @xmath20 is taken to be a a larger and larger random sample from a fractal .",
    "it is not clear in general how to assign a dimension to a point process but our theory and simulations suggest a purely statistical way to identify a class of them for which it does make sense to assign a dimension .",

    "the second slide statistic @xmath4 is negative for the examples given so far but @xmath4 is positive for the cauchy distribution and is often found to be positive for the log daily returns of the standard and poor 500 index which is yet another demonstration of the non - normality of these returns .",
    "the construction of @xmath38 requires several ideas working in concert and can be summarized as follows . in section  [ s:2 ] , we introduce a variant of the differential entropy called the genial entropy which is the starting point for defining the slide statistics . unlike the differential entropy ,",
    "the genial entropy is scale invariant and in section  [ s : inequality ] we prove it is never negative which will give a new lower bound for the differential entropy . given a finite set of distinct points @xmath20 in a metric space , we find the distance from each point to its nearest neighbour and arrange these distances in descending order so @xmath39 .",
