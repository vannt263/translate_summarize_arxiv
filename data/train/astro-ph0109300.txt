    "what better place to review the local interstellar medium ( lism ) than in paris  which has nurtured creative thinking in the sciences , mathematics and arts for many centuries ?",
    "the launch of the @xmath0 satellite in 1972 provided uv spectrometers capable of observing dominant trace ions in the low density intercloud medium ( as it was then called ) around the sun .",

    "vidal - madjar and colleagues used @xmath0 data to evaluate the inhomogeneity of ism within a few parsecs , based on a possible gradient in radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the fact that the interstellar cloud seen inside of the solar system ( now called the local interstellar cloud , lic ) does @xmath4 extend to @xmath1 cen , the nearest star , was originally discovered with @xmath0 @xcite and remains a puzzle . during the last decade of the 20th century",
    ", observations by ghrs and stis on hst , and high - resolution optical data , provided the basic properties , composition , and kinematics of individual cloudlets close to the sun . @xmath5 and @xmath6 have now made _ in situ _ observations of interstellar gas and dust inside of the solar system , and the pickup ions and anomalous cosmic ray populations which result from the interaction of ism with the solar wind .    these data , together with heliosphere models ,",
    "show that the physical properties of the ism influence the heliosphere configuration , the astrospheres of external cool stars , and the interplanetary environment of both our own solar system and extra - solar planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the relative absence of o / b stars nearby the sun ( there are no o stars and four b - stars within 30 pc ) means that the lism properties are pieced together from observations of several types of target objects , each with limitations , including a , f , g , k stars ( there are 57 a stars within 30 pc ) and white dwarf stars ( 118 are within 20 pc @xcite ) .",
    "optical  and uv absorption lines show that the sun is embedded in a flow of interstellar cloudlets with a bulk velocity of 28.2 , and approaching the sun from the upstream direction l=12.6 , b=11.7 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an upwind direction in the local standard of rest of l=3 , b=5 , and flow velocity 17.0 .",
    "the distribution of absorption components about the best - fit velocity is consistent with a gaussian ( e@xmath7 ) with a dispersion @xmath84.5 .",
    "the strongest  absorption lines within 30 pc are found towards @xmath1 oph ( 14 pc ) , but the properties of the cloud forming these features are virtually known .",
    "three  components are seen towards @xmath1 aql ( 5 pc ) , showing the complex lism structure @xcite .",
    "based on cloud radial velocities ( v ) , the next interstellar cloud to be encountered by the sun as it traverses interstellar space is likely to be either the cloud in front of @xmath1 cen ( v@xmath218 ) or one of the clouds towards @xmath1 aql ( e.g. v@xmath227 ) located near the direction of solar apex motion .",
    "the ionization of the lism has been found from observations of /  and /   towards nearby stars .",
    "the  fine - structure lines are insensitive to the radiation field since they are collisionally populated , while in warm gas  is dominated by photoionization , and radiative and dielectronic recombination .",

    ".    a self - consistent photoionization model of interstellar matter within @xmath2 5 pc of the sun yields @xmath20.13 , @xmath20.24 , t@xmath27200 k , and fractional ionization x(h)@xmath20.3 and x(he)@xmath20.4 at the solar location , in good agreement with observations ( model 17 in @xcite , hereafter sf17 ) .",
    "this model , constrained both by _ in situ _ particle data and absorption line data , includes radiation from nearby hot stars , diffuse emission from the soft x - ray background , and unobserved euv emission from a possible evaporative boundary between the local ism and hot gas ( also see slavin s talk in this volume ) . in low column - density gas  equilibrium depends partly on photoionization , while at higher column densities n and h ionization are coupled by charge exchange . in contrast , o and h ionization are tightly coupled by charge exchange . at lower",
    "column densities , sf17 predict an inverse relation between n(o  i)/n(n  i ) and n(h  i ) ( figure [ slavinfrisch ] ) , and this same behavior is observed for log n(h  i)@xmath1317.8  ( figure [ no ] ) .",

    "  show that the interstellar /ratio varies by a factor of @xmath22 between sightlines ( e.g. @xcite ) , indicating the ionization of lism is inhomogeneous .",
    "ism within 30 pc is distributed asymmetrically around the sun , and the sun is located in the leading edge of an outflow from loop i and the sco - cen association @xcite .",

    "the detection by @xmath5 of interstellar  provides a direct measure of the heliocentric velocity of the lic @xcite which agrees with values found from the fuv fluorescent scattering of solar 584   emission @xcite .",

    "neutral ism flows into the heliosphere , interacts with the solar wind plasma , and forms the pickup ion ( pui ) and anomalous cosmic ray populations . the puis give the composition of the parent population of interstellar , , , and  atoms @xcite , and seed the anomalous cosmic rays population observed in the inner solar system ( e.g. @xcite ) . the puis yield o  i / n  i=7.0@xmath121.5 inside of the heliosheath , or 8.8@xmath121.5 after correcting for 25% heliosphere filtration of",

    ", the observed grains correspond to a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 116@xmath18 .",
    "however @xmath240% of the grain mass is removed by heliosheath and heliospheric filtration of small charged grains interacting with the solar wind , indicating a lower value ( r@xmath19@xmath270 ) for the lic ( assuming h / he=10 ) .",

    ", interstellar gas surprisingly comprises @xmath298% of the diffuse material within the heliosphere .",
    "an increase in the lic density from the current value to n()=10  would cause the heliosphere to contract to a radius of @xmath21015 au in the upstream direction ( from the current value of @xmath2100 au ) , dramatically alter the interplanetary environments of the inner planets , and expose outer planets to `` raw '' ism @xcite .",
