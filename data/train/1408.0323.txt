    "the plasma liner experiment ( plx ) is a laboratory plasma physics facility at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "the primary purpose and goal of plx is to form and study spherically imploding plasma liners via multiple merging plasma jets , motivated by high - energy - density ( he d ) physics and magneto - inertial fusion ( mif ) applications @xcite . for fundamental hed - physics studies @xcite ,",
    "plx is envisioned to provide an economic means for forming inertially confined cm- , @xmath8s- , and mbar - scale plasmas @xcite upon the stagnation of up to 60 merged pulsed - power - driven , supersonic plasma jets .",
    "such an experiment would allow for good diagnostic measurements on larger - spatial and longer - temporal scales and a much higher shot rate than those of typical laser- or z - pinch - driven he d experiments .",
    "for the mif application @xcite , the use of a spherically converging plasma liner for compressing a magnetized target plasma would avoid the repetitive hardware destruction inherent in solid - liner approaches ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and it would allow for a higher repetition rate ( @xmath9  hz ) , which is desirable for an economic , pulsed fusion - energy system .    the plx facility was built in 20102011 , and the first plasma jet was fired in september , 2011 .",
    "initial research characterized in detail the plasma properties and evolution of a single jet @xcite .",
    "a second railgun was installed in mid-2012 , and ensuing experiments focused on the oblique merging of two plasma jets , resulting in detailed observations shown to be consistent with collisional plasma shocks @xcite .",
    "due to loss of funding , we were not able to build the facility up to 30 railguns as originally planned . instead , ongoing experiments are focused on the head - on merging of two plasma jets to form and study unmagnetized and magnetized plasma shocks .",
    "an in - chamber pulsed helmholtz coil was installed in late 2013 to enable the study of magnetized shocks .",
    "the facility now enables a unique experimental research program on the detailed study of plasma shocks , from collisional - to - collisionless and unmagnetized - to - magnetized regimes .",
    "preliminary designs for a 36- or 60-jet experiment ( with @xmath10  mj of capacitive stored energy ) to form spherically imploding plasma liners are also in hand .    plasma jet and shock studies on plx complement many other related , contemporary experimental efforts .",
    "examples include studies of plasma jet dynamics , interactions , and/or shock formation in astrophysically or fusion - relevant contexts using a variety of plasma formation methods , ranging from coaxial plasma guns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to wire - array - driven pinches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to laser - driven experiments ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general ,",
    "plx plasmas are colder and more collisional than the other experiments , but have the benefits of larger spatial size for ease of diagnostic measurements , more choices for the working plasma species , and the option of both unmagnetized and magnetized experiments . a brief overview of many plasma - jet experiments and formation methods is given in @xcite .",

    "if plx is upgraded to have many more guns , e.g. , 36 or 60 , then the merging and spherical convergence of all the jets could produce cm- , @xmath8s- , and mbar - scale plasmas , enabling unique fundamental physics studies of many he d topics ( as described in the u.s . dept .  of energy report of the workshop on high energy density laboratory physics research needs , nov .  1518 , 2009 ) and the exploration of a standoff mif driver for fusion energy @xcite .",
