    "semi - relativistic current - density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite has become one on the standard tools for the calculation of electronic ground state ( gs ) properties in magnetic fields .",
    "apart from the practical issue of finding an accurate and manageable energy functional , the basic fact of _ non - interacting @xmath0-representability _ ( nivr ) of the exact electron density @xmath11 and the paramagnetic current density @xmath12 is a prerequisite for the existence of a kohn - sham scheme . in a first step",
    ", we are investigating if both _",
    "exact _ densities derived from the correlated two - particle state can be represented by the same set of one - particle orbitals @xmath13 in the form ( atomic units @xmath14 are used throughout ) @xmath15 = \\sum_k^{occ } r_k^2({\\bf r } ) \\ ; \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } \\zeta_k({\\bf r } ) \\label{current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the modulus @xmath16 and the phase @xmath17 of the kohn - sham wave - functions ( ks - wf ) are real functions . _",
    "if _ the ks - wfs are well defined , then the effective potentials @xmath18 could be obtained from the ks equations as exercised in ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we are only discussing if and when ks - wfs exist . unlike in density functional theory ( dft ) ,",
    "nivr in cdft as defined above is neither guaranteed for nor restricted to gss .    for vanishing magnetic field ,",
    "dft applies , which rests on some unique mappings .",
    "if @xmath19 describes a many - body gs - wf and @xmath11 and @xmath20 the corresponding density and external potential ( modulo a constant ) , then of course @xmath21 is unique , but also @xmath22 , if infinitely high potential walls are excluded .",
    "hohenberg and kohn @xcite proved that the mapping between @xmath19 and @xmath11 is even one - to - one , and hence @xmath23 is also unique @xmath24 \\rightleftharpoons\\\\[-2 mm ] { \\scriptstyle { \\cal d}^{-1 } } \\end{array } \\;\\;n({\\bf r } ) \\label{map}\\ ] ] the situation of ( [ map ] ) holds for both the interacting and the non - interacting cases . for a nivr density @xmath11",
    ", the mapping @xmath25 for the non - interacting case yields the ( effective ) ks potential of the interacting system .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g. in @xcite ) that not every mathematically well behaved density @xmath11 is gs density to some potential @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , dft has been based on functionals which are also defined for non-@xmath26-representable densities .",
    "nevertheless , a ks potential ( derivative of the density functional ) can only exist for nivr densities .    in the presence of a magnetic field and for ( semi - relativistic )",
    "current density functional theory ( cdft ) , the generalization of @xmath27 for the ground state still exists , but , vignale and rasolt @xcite just _ presupposed _ the existence of the generalization of @xmath28 @xcite implying that nivr and the existence of a ks scheme has not been proven .",
    "capelle and vignale @xcite , on the other hand , have shown that there can be several external potentials @xmath29 which provide the same wave functions and densities @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent both external potentials ( @xmath20 and @xmath33 ) and both densities ( @xmath11 and @xmath34 ) , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath28 can not exist anymore as a unique mapping . for spin density",
    "functional theory ( sdft ) the same problem was first pointed out by von barth and hedin @xcite , and later analyzed in detail in @xcite . for our model system the l.h.s . of ( [ cdft - maps ] )",
    "is obvious from the fact that the exact densities @xmath32 are determined by the effective frequency @xmath35 alone and not by the external confinement frequency @xmath36 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath37 independently ( see sect.ii ) . in other words ,",
    "all combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath38 , which provide the same @xmath39 , provide the same densities .",
    "this fact rules the existence of the mapping @xmath28 out , but does neither prove nor rule out nivr or the existence of a ks system .",
    "wensauer and rssler @xcite used the scaling property of our quantum dot model system @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total orbital angular momentum , in order to apply the consequences from the hohenberg - kohn theorem to non - zero fields . indeed , ( [ scaling ] ) means that the hamiltonian for a non - zero magnetic field @xmath42 has the same eigen - functions as the hamiltonian for zero magnetic field and the effective confinement frequency @xmath43 .",
    "only the eigenvalues are shifted by @xmath44 , where @xmath3 is the total orbital angular momentum .",
    "the point is , however , that this does _ not _ mean that the gs densities @xmath32 for all @xmath38 ( for fixed @xmath36 ) are nivr .",
    "instead , this conclusion applies only to those cases , where the corresponding reference state at zero @xmath38 is a ground state .",
    "this are the states with @xmath5 , which are special insofar , as the paramagnetic current vanishes even for non - zero magnetic field .",
    "their argument does not say anything about nivr of the other cases .    in the present paper we investigate , under which conditions the exact gs densities @xmath32 of our model system can be represented by ks orbitals . for making the conclusions gauge independent , we also matched the gauge independent _ vorticity _ @xmath45 instead of the paramagnetic current density @xmath34 .",
    "we will show that for a typical quantum dot model ( two electrons in a parabolic confinement and a magnetic field ) the exact gs densities are _ not _ generally nivr .",
    "this is not a sophistry or subtleness , but the violation of nivr is massive .",
    "this suffices to disprove the assumption of _ general _ nivr and the _ general _ existence of a ks system for the gss . on this background , all semi - relativistic cdft calculations and functionals",
    "have to be considered with caution . on the other hand",
    ", this does not mean that all results are utterly wrong",
    ". however , this fact undermines the credibility of semi - relativistic cdft as a tool for making forecasts .",

    "we introduced cylinder coordinates @xmath49 with the cylinder axis perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath50 this is a widely used effective hamiltonian model for a two - electron quantum dot .",
    "the interaction of the spins with the magnetic field @xmath51 is omitted ( by chosing @xmath52 ) for two reasons .",
    "first , in semi - relativistic effective hamiltonian theory @xmath53 is a material dependent parameter well below the vacuum value @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the limiting case of vanishing @xmath53 ought to be covered by an exact theory .",
    "second , the zeeman term would make the hamiltonian spin dependent and would necessitate a description of the system by the _ spin _",
    "density @xmath55 ( instead of the total density @xmath56 ) ) and the paramagnetic current density @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the spin density in sdft produces its own problems @xcite even for vanishing magnetic field , which we do not want to let interfere with the problems produced by the magnetic field .",
