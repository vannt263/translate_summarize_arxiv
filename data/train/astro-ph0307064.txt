    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which the instabilities in the accretion disks cause outbursts ( for reviews of dwarf novae , see @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a class of dne , which show superhumps during their long , bright outbursts ( superoutbursts ) ( for basic reviews , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae have short orbital periods ( @xmath3 usually shorter than 0.1 d ) , qualifying them as the highly evolved population on the standard evolutionary track of cvs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some objects have been even suggested to have passed the cv minimum period , at which the thermal time scales of the secondary star ( kelvin - helmholtz time ) become comparable to the mass - transfer time scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . after passing this period minimum ,",
    "the mass - losing secondary stars are believed to become degenerate , and will become cvs with brown - dwarf secondaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several works have been extensively made to observationally confirm possibility ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there seems to be a certain degree of emerging evidence that at least some su uma - type dwarf novae look like to have brown dwarf secondaries .",
    "these object are also intriguing objects from the standpoint of the disk - instability model for dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "historically , the most extreme member ( wz sge ) was selected as the prototype of a small class of su uma - type dwarf novae ( wz sge - type dwarf novae ) , which are originally characterized by a long ( @xmath0 10 yr ) outburst recurrence time and a large ( @xmath0 8 mag ) outburst amplitude ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of such powerful outbursts of wz sge has still been one of the central problems of dwarf nova accretion disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    from a slightly different standpoint , @xcite observationally proposed that some dne with large outburst amplitudes ( mostly su uma - type dwarf novae ) show unusual properties , and called them tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae ( toads ) .",
    "although there exists an argument against this nomenclature ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , these objects are generally considered to represent a borderline population of dne between the most unusual wz sge - type dwarf novae and usual su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the toads and wz sge - type stars are also known to show extremely low frequency of normal outbursts @xcite . @xcite and @xcite reported that the toads have unusual properties of their superoutburst , particularly in that the toads sometimes show _ intermediate _ outbursts having properties between full superoutbursts and su uma - type normal outbursts , and in that some of the superoutbursts of the toads are followed by post - superoutburst rebrightenings .",
    "the latter property has been subsequently recognized as a common feature with soft x - ray transients ( black - hole transients ) @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of this phenomenon was seen in eg cnc which showed six successive post - superoutburst rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that the unusual properties of the toads are a result of low mass - transfer rate and low viscosity in quiescence .",
    "this possibility has been tested by several authors to more precisely reproduce the observed properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    from the observational side ,",
    "both toads and wz sge - type dwarf novae are known to ( almost exclusively ) show lengthening of the superhump period during the superoutburst plateau ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , whose origin is still poorly understood .",
    "@xcite showed that a significant deviation from the linear declining trend and a regrowth of the superhumps during the terminal stage of a superoutburst in v1028 cyg , whose outburst amplitude is comparable to that of toads .",
    "these phenomena , although still poorly described or understood , may provide an additional clue for understanding the unusual behavior of the accretion disks in large - amplitude , rarely outbursting su uma - type dwarf novae , which are sometimes referred to as toads or wz sge - type .",
    "ho delphini (= s 10066 ) is a dwarf nova discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported two outburst in 1963 october and 1966 september .",
    "although the object was given the permanent variable star designation @xcite , virtually no observation had been reported until recent years .",
    "this lack of observation was partly because of the error in the original discovery report by @xcite .",
    "the error was corrected in the third volume of the fourth edition of the gcvs @xcite .",
    "@xcite gave a finding chart and @xcite reported precise coordinates .",
    "@xcite recorded relatively strong balmer and he  i emission lines , confirming the cv classification .",

    "a stronger preference of short-@xmath11 systems , than in figure [ fig : bright ] , is apparent , although the location of the objects with superhump regrowth nearly overlaps the location of the objects with brightening .",
    "this figure suggests that the appearance of superhump regrowth and brightening near the termination of the superoutbursts is phenomenologically coupled .",
    "this statistical finding may comprise another aspect of positive correlations between brightening and superhump regrowth , which was claimed by @xcite based on the analysis of the 1995 superoutburst of v1028 cyg .",
    "the location of ho del is unusual in its apparent absence of the superhump regrowth .",
    "this deviation from the general trend may be related to a rather low ( @xmath05.0 mag ) outburst amplitude of ho del for a long @xmath18 object .",
    "if this is the case , the conditions necessary to manifest the unusual large - amplitude outbursts in some rarely outbursting su uma - type dwarf novae , may be somehow responsible for producing the late - time regrowth the superhumps .",
    "we do not discuss whether this argument can be observationally extended to the most extreme wz sge - type dwarf novae , which may be a natural extension of so - called toads , while recent theoretical interpretations seem to prefer a different entity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which a 1:2 resonance is claimed to be essential for the manifestation of their unusual outbursts .",
    "the exclusion of wz sge - type dwarf novae from figure [ fig : growth ] may be an artificial result our examination of these phenomena ( regrowth of superhumps and brightening ) restricted to pre-``dip '' observations of wz sge - type superoutbursts . if we consider that the rebrightening stage of wz sge - type superoutbursts actually corresponds to the late stage of su uma - type superoutbursts discussed in this study , it may be possible both wz sge - type rebrightenings and late stage brightening ( and possibly regrowth of superhumps ) have the same underlying mechanism .",
    "we leave this an observational open question , partly because individual wz sge - type rebrightenings show a wide variety [ at least some of which bear more resemblance to normal outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , while some of them even look like a double superoutburst @xcite ] , and partly because observations are insufficient in most wz sge - type stars to judge whether there was a regrowth of superhumps during such a stage .",
    "although the original toad classification has been shown to represent a rather loosely defined class of objects , the presently discussed features may provide a better observational distinction for su uma - type dwarf novae with unusual characteristics .",

    "is confirmed to be an su uma - type dwarf nova with a superhump period of 0.06453(6 ) d. based on the recent observations and the past records , the outbursts of ho del are found to be relatively rare , with the shortest intervals of superoutbursts being @xmath0740 d.    we also performed a literature survey of su uma - type dwarf novae , and presented a new set of basic statistics .",
    "this new statistics revealed that many of su uma - type dwarf novae have a fairly typical value of supercycle lengths of @xmath0300 d regardless of the superhump period .",
    "there is , however , a wide - spread distribution of @xmath18 around the period 0.055@xmath190.065 d. a previously proposed picture of a continuous entity between usual su uma - type dwarf novae and wz sge stars seems to have become less concrete .    the su uma - type dwarf novae with a brightening trend or with a regrowth of superhumps near the termination of a superoutburst are found to be rather tightly confined in a small region on the ( superhump period  supercycle length ) plane .",
    "these characteristics seem to provide better criteria for a small , rather unusual population of su uma - type dwarf novae , which likely correspond to , and would better define , the objects previously selected by outburst amplitudes ( tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae ) .",
