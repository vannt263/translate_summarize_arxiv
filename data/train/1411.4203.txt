    "another interesting interaction that gives good results in the study of the dark energy is the coupling between the scalar field and the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) invariant .",

    "we have found that the model covers a variety of de scenarios , all of them in the range of the measurements made by the different collaborations .",
    "+ we also considered an approach that allows in principle to reconstruct the potential an the gb coupling for arbitrary given cosmological scenarios @xcite .",
    "we showed explicit examples of reconstruction for quintessence and phantom power - law solutions , where the obtained potentials are of exponential form with polynomial factor .",
    "these type of potentials were proposed in @xcite as coming from low - energy limit of higher dimensional theories ( after compactification of extra dimensions ) , and which present attractive features for description of realistic cosmologies .",
    "the fact that the potential was reconstructed from power - law solutions , indicates that if we start from the model ( [ eq1 ] ) with gb coupling and potential given by ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) respectively , then the dynamics of this model on the frw background gives rise to scaling solutions which play an important role in quintessence scenarios @xcite .",
    "the polynomial factor in the potential and gb coupling disappears in absence of the non - minimal coupling ( @xmath202 ) as follows from expressions ( [ eq22 ] ) , ( [ eq23 ] ) , ( [ eq29 ] ) and ( [ eq30 ] ) , leading to pure exponential gb couplings and potentials , which are typical of string - inspired gravity models .",
    "+ the model could also be reconstructed for a little rip solution where the hubble parameter increases exponentially and the scalar potential becomes a fourth - order polynomial . a quintom scenario with quintessence and phantom phases",
    "was also reconstructed for the hubble parameter ( [ eq43 ] ) , which led to the gb coupling ( [ eq44 ] ) and potential ( [ eq45 ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the phantom scenario could be realized without introducing the ghost scalar field , which is quite attractive for a viable model of dark energy . for the de sitter solution",
    "we have found that both the potential and the gb coupling depend on the square of the field .",
    "+ resuming , the non - minimal and gb couplings allow exact solutions that give rise to interesting cosmological scenarios describing the de in a manner consistent with current astrophysical observations .",
    "these solutions include phantom expansion without singularities and transitions between quintessence and phantom phases .",
    "it was also demonstrated that in principle any given late - time cosmological solution relevant to current observations ( including quintessence , phantom , quintom , de sitter , little rip ) may be reconstructed by scalar - tensor model with gb and non - minimal coupling .",
    "the reconstructed potential for power - law quintessence solutions has been considered previously as coming from higher dimensional gravity theories .",
    "all these facts enable us to conclude that the combination of gb and non - minimal couplings gives a good explanation of the dynamics of the late time universe , and could play an important role in revealing the nature of the de .      99 s.perlmutter _ et al . _ ,",
