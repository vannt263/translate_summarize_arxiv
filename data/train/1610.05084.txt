    "have often been used , as they allow to probe the susceptibility at different frequencies simultaneously . as we have argued ,",
    "the features of power spectrum and susceptibility of neurons driven by a slowly switching dichotomous noise arise mainly because of the absence of further stochasticity within the two noise states . a broadband stimulus acts as an additional noise source , and one can thus expect it to have a qualitative effect on these features .    in fig",
    "[ fig : broadband ] , we plot the power spectrum and the absolute value of the susceptibility for two switching - rate combinations and three different intensities of a gaussian stimulus with a flat spectrum of height @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the cutoff frequency . the intensity of the signal is then given by @xmath128 . in simulations ,",
    "we use a time step @xmath129 , which means that the stimulus is effectively white ( the cutoff frequency corresponds to the nyquist frequency ) .    in line with our reasoning above and with previous results for the power spectrum of dmp - driven pif neurons @xcite , additional noise ( here the broadband signal )",
    "can be seen to abolish the undamped periodicity in spectrum and susceptibility . for small signal strength , this is hardly noticeable up to frequencies that would be considered high in neurophysiology ( note that , assuming a membrane time constant @xmath130{ms}$ ] , the dimensionless frequency @xmath131 corresponds to ) . with increasing signal strength ,",
    "the range where our expressions match the simulation is shifted to smaller frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the broadband signal does not affect spectrum and susceptibility at all frequencies ; instead , there seems to be a cutoff frequency , depending on the signal strength , below which the additional noise has no effect .",
    "the influence of a broadband stimulus is more noticeable for slow switching ; for faster switching , the periodicity is less prominent in the first place . in particular for the susceptibility with fast switching",
    ", the periodicity is hardly visible and there are no qualitative differences between the different noise intensities , except for the better statistics that a stronger signal brings along .",
    "we have studied leaky integrate - and - fire neurons driven by an asymmetric dichotomous noise . for this particular kind of colored noise , we were able to derive exact expressions for the spontaneous power spectrum and the susceptibility to an additive signal .",
    "we have verified our expressions by comparison to numerical simulations .",
    "a prominent difference to the classical results for lif neurons driven by gaussian white noise @xcite is the periodic structure that both the power spectrum and the susceptibility exhibit at high frequencies . for the power spectrum ,",
    "we have explained how this structure arises through delta - peaks in the spike - triggered rate .",
    "these stem from the fact that there is a finite probability that an isi has a certain length ( the deterministic time from reset to threshold in the plus state ) .",
    "they are thus a manifestation of the discrete nature of the dichotomous noise . as we have shown , this periodic structure of the spectrum is independent of the chosen neuron model .",
    "the susceptibility shows a similar periodic structure .",
    "however , here , we lack an intuitive explanation like we found for the power spectrum .",
    "other differences between the dmp - driven and the gaussian - white - noise case can be traced to the fact that the noise is colored : in contrast to lif neurons driven by gaussian white noise , for which the susceptibility decays to zero at a finite phase lag for increasing frequency @xcite , here it oscillates around a finite value at zero phase lag .",
    "this indicates that the system can respond to arbitrarily fast signals , a feature that has also been observed for lif neurons driven by exponentially correlated gaussian noise @xcite ( for an in - depth discussion for more general if models , see @xcite ) .    especially when the noise switching is slow , the spectral measures are dominated by the periodic structure . by numerical simulations we demonstrated that this feature is robust in a certain sense against small additional fluctuations .",
    "although a very weak broadband gaussian stimulus leads to a non - pathological behavior of the spectral measures , oscillatory features are still present in a wide frequency band .",
    "specifically , although the power spectrum of the spike train becomes flat and the susceptibility decays in the limit @xmath132 , both functions still oscillate up to considerably high frequency .",
    "remarkably , the effective cutoff frequency is set by the noise level .",
    "our results are applicable to situations , where nerve cells are stimulated with a two - state input , such as a stimulus originating in a bursting neuron or input from a population of neurons that undergo up / down transitions .",
    "a further , non - obvious application is the shot - noise - limit of the markovian dichotomous noise , which allows us to obtain expressions for an lif neurons driven by white , excitatory poisson input ( a special case of the setup treated in ref .",
    "this will be pursued elsewhere .      around @xmath133 ( i.e. the stable fixed point of the minus dynamics , where @xmath134 ) ) , linearly independent solutions to the hypergeometric equation ( the homogeneous part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_ode ] ) ) are given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the hypergeometric function @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : deltap ] , [ eq : deltam ] ) . however , in the following we are only going to use that they vanish outside of the interval @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "given the two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous ode , a particular solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : inhom ] ) is known @xcite : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the wronskian , @xmath142 and the upper integration limit @xmath143 can still be freely chosen .",
    "the general solution is then given by @xmath144    in order to fix the integration constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensol ] ) , one needs to distinguish two possible parameter regimes : if @xmath145 , corresponding to @xmath146 , the fixed point in the minus dynamics , @xmath147 ( corresponding to the singular point at @xmath133 in the hypergeometric differential equation ) lies on the lower boundary ( no trajectories can move to more negative values ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath148 , corresponding to @xmath149 , it lies within the interval of interest .    in the first case , the integration constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensol ] ) can be fixed over the whole interval @xmath150 $ ] by imposing the boundary conditions at the threshold , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . because @xmath153 , both can be fulfilled by setting @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( equivalent to @xmath156 , as the integrand vanishes for all @xmath157 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath146 , one has @xmath158 at @xmath133 , the lower boundary of the possible dynamics , the flux needs to vanish , leading to the condition @xmath159 where we have extended the interval of integration from @xmath160 $ ] to @xmath161 $ ] ( the integrand vanishes for @xmath162 ) and used that @xmath163 @xcite .    in the second case",
    ", @xmath149 , the fixed point in the minus dynamics lies within the interval in which we want to obtain a solution for @xmath164 . as pointed out previously @xcite",
    ", one can not expect the same solution to be valid on both sides of such a point .",
    "in particular , for the lif neuron , this means that the integration constants need to be chosen separately in the intervals @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 $ ] : above the fixed point , they need to satisfy the boundary conditions at the threshold , below it , those at the reset voltage ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the rest are satisfied by setting @xmath167 ( or any value @xmath168 ) .",
    "one thus has @xmath169 the condition that the flux needs to be continuous at the fixed point implies that @xmath170 which is equivalent to the condition that was obtained for the other case , @xmath171 ( eq .  ( [ eq : zerocond ] ) ) .",
