    "the optimization problem appears in several fields of physics and mathematics .",
    "it is known from mathematics that every local minimum of a convex function defined over a convex set is also the global minimum of the function .",
    "but the main problem is to find this optimum . from the physical point of view",
    "every dynamical process can be considered in terms of finding the optimum of the action functional .",
    "the best example is the trajectory of the free point mass in mechanics which follows the shortest way between two points .",
    "let us assume one has successfully set up a mathematical model for the optimization problem under consideration in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a scalar potential function ( fitness function ) defined over a d - dimensional vector space @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the absolute minimum of @xmath2 which is the search target .",
    "problems of this type are called parameter optimization .",
    "typically the search space is high - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the idea of evolution is the consideration of an ensemble of searchers which move through the search space . as a illustrative example we consider the relation between the equation of motion in mechanics , obtained by variation of the action functional @xmath6 to get a trajectory of minimal action , and the introduction of the probability distribution for all possible trajectories by a functional integral . because of the weight factor @xmath7 for every trajectory , the trajectory of minimal action has the highest probability .",
    "the equation of the probability distribution deduced from the functional integral is the diffusion equation for a free classical particle .",
    "the same idea is behind the attempt to describe optimization processes with the help of dynamical processes .",
    "we will be concerned with the time evolution of an ensemble of searchers defined by a density @xmath8 .",
    "the search process defines a dynamics @xmath9\\ ] ] with continuous or discrete time steps .",
    "an optimization dynamics @xmath10 is considered as successful , if any ( or nearly any ) initial density @xmath11 converges to a target density @xmath12 which is concentrated around the minimum @xmath4 of @xmath13 .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the case where @xmath10 is given as a second order partial differential equation . among the most successful strategies are the class of thermodynamic oriented @xcite and the class of biological oriented strategies @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to compare on the basis of pde - models thermodynamical and biologically motivated strategies by reducing both to equivalent eigenvalue problems .",
    "further we introduce a model for mixed strategies and investigate their prospective power @xcite .",
    "at first we want to investigate the simplest case of an evolutionary dynamics known in the literature as `` simulated annealing '' .",
    "the analogy between equilibrium statistical mechanics and the metropolis algorithm @xcite was first discussed by kirkpatrick et al . in @xcite . there , an ensemble of searchers determined by the distribution @xmath8 move through the search space . in the following we consider only the case of a fixed temperature .",
    "then the dynamics is given by the fokker - planck equation @xmath14=d\\triangle p+d\\nabla ( \\beta p\\nabla u ) \\label{boltzmann1}\\ ] ] with the `` diffusion '' constant @xmath15 , the reciprocal temperature @xmath16 and the state vector @xmath17 .",
    "the stationary distribution @xmath18 is equal to the extremum of functional ( [ liapunov1])@xcite .",
    "for the case @xmath19 the complete analytical solution is known and may be expressed by the well - known heat kernel or green s function , respectively .",
    "the corresponding dynamics is a simulated annealing at an infinite temperature which describes the diffusion process . in this case",
    "the optimum of the potential will be found by a random walk , because the diffusion is not sensitive to the potential .",
    "the average time which the process requires to move from the initial state @xmath20 to the optimum @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 we note that in several cases a generalization from the number @xmath23 to the case where @xmath15 is a symmetrical matrix is possible @xcite .",
    "further solvable cases can be extracted from the ansatz @xmath24",
    "y(\\vec{x},t)\\label{ansatz1}\\ ] ] which after separation of the time and space variables leads to the eigenvalue equation @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath26 and potential @xmath27 this equation is the well - known stationary schrdinger equation from quantum mechanics . under the consideration of a discrete spectrum",
    "this leads to the general solution @xmath28    \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^\\infty c_i\\psi_i(\\vec{x})\\exp(-\\epsilon_i t )    \\label{generalsolution1 } \\qquad .\\ ] ] to discuss more properties of equation ( [ eigeneq1 ] ) , one has to introduce the concept of the liapunov functional @xcite defined by the formula : @xmath29 in the case of equation @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 for the original equation ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) , the construction of such functional is impossible .",
    "we remark that the main difference between schrdinger equation and thermodynamical strategies is given by the time - dependent factor in the solution . in quantum mechanics",
    "this set of factors @xmath32 forms a complete basis in the hilbert space of functions over @xmath33 but in the solution of ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) this is not the case .    because of the existence of an equilibrium distribution the first eigenvalue @xmath34 vanishes and the solution",
    "is given by @xmath35 \\qquad .\\ ] ] that means that the equilibrium distribution is located around the optimum since the exponential @xmath36 is a monotonous function and the optimum is unchanged . in the limit",
    "@xmath37 the distribution @xmath8 converges to the equilibrium distribution and the strategy successfully terminates at the optimum .",
    "but this convergence is dependent on the positiveness of the operator @xmath38 defined in ( [ eigeneq1 ] ) .",
    "usually the laplace operator is strictly negative definite with respect to a scalar product in the hilbert space of the square integrable functions ( @xmath39-space ) .",
    "therefore the potential alone determines the definiteness of the operator .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath40 a sufficient condition for that is @xmath41 which means , that the curvature of the landscape represented by @xmath42 must be smaller than the square of the gradient .",
    "depending on the potential it thus is possible to fix a subset of @xmath43 on which the operator @xmath38 is positive definite .",
    "now we approximate the fitness function @xmath13 by a taylor expansion around the optimum including the second order . because the first derivative vanishes one obtains the expression @xmath44 for @xmath45 we get the simple harmonic oscillator which is solved by separation of variables .",
    "the eigenfunctions are products of hermitian polynomials with respect to the dimension of the search space .",
    "apart from a constant the same result is obtained in the case @xmath46 .",
    "a collection of formulas can be found in appendix a.    the approximation of the general solution ( [ generalsolution1 ] ) for large times leads to @xmath47\\psi_1(\\vec{x})+\\ldots\\ ] ] because of the condition @xmath48 , the time @xmath49 can be interpreted as relaxation time , i.e. the time for the last jump to the optimum .",
    "even more interesting than the consideration of the time is the calculation of velocities .",
    "one can define two possible velocities .",
    "a first velocity @xmath50 on the fitness landscape and a second one @xmath51 in the @xmath52-th direction of the search space .",
    "the measure of the velocities is given by the time - like change of the expectation values of the vector @xmath53 or the potential @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "with respect to equation ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 the velocity @xmath50 depends on the curvature and the gradient .",
    "so we can deduce a sufficient condition for a positive velocity @xmath56 which is up to a factor the same as condition ( [ condition1 ] ) .",
    "for the quadratic potential ( [ quadratic ] ) one obtains @xmath57 this is a restriction to a subset of @xmath43 .    in this case",
    "it is also possible to explicitly calculate the velocities for @xmath45 @xmath58 it is interesting to note that only the first two eigenvalues are important for the velocities and that both velocities vanish in the limit @xmath37 . besides , the first velocity @xmath50 is independent of the parameter @xmath59 except for special initial conditions where the factor @xmath60 depends on the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the other case @xmath46 is similar and can be found in appendix a.",
    "in principle , the biologically motivated strategy is different from the thermodynamical strategy .",
    "whereas in the thermodynamical strategy the population size remains constant , it is changed with respect to the fundamental processes reproduction and selection in the case of biologically motivated strategies , but is kept unchanged on average .",
    "the simplest model with a similar behaviour is the fisher - eigen equation given by @xmath61p(\\vec{x},t)+d\\triangle p(\\vec{x},t )    \\label{darwin}\\\\ <",
    "u>(t ) & = & \\frac{\\int u(x)p(\\vec{x},t ) dx}{\\int      p(\\vec{x},t ) dx } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case one can also form a liapunov functional which satisfies the equation ( [ functionalequation ] ) similar to the thermodynamical strategy .",
    "one obtains the positive functional @xmath62 which also has the stationary distribution as an extremum .    by using the ansatz @xmath63",
    "y(\\vec{x},t)\\label{ansatz2}\\ ] ] and the separating time and space variables , the dynamics reduces to the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath64\\psi_i(\\vec{x})=0    \\label{eigenequation}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are the eigenvalues and @xmath66 are the eigenfunctions .",
    "this leads to the complete solution @xmath67 the difference to the thermodynamical strategy is given by the fact that the eigenvalue @xmath34 in the case of the fisher - eigen strategy is a non zero value , i.e. the relaxation time is modified and one obtains @xmath68 for the harmonic potential ( [ quadratic ] ) the problem is exactly solvable for any dimension @xmath0 and the solution is very similar to the thermodynamical strategy for @xmath45 . in the other case @xmath46 we obtain a different problem known from scattering theory .",
    "if the search space is unbound the spectrum of the operator @xmath38 is continuous . from the physical point of view",
    "we are interested in positive values of the potential or fitness function ( [ quadratic ] ) , respectively .",
    "this leads to a compact search space given by the interval @xmath69 $ ] in each direction with @xmath70 .",
    "we now have to introduce boundary conditions .",
    "the most natural choice is to let the solution vanish on the boundary . as a result an additional restriction appears and the spectrum of the operator @xmath38 is now discrete .",
    "a collection of formulas connected to both eigenvalue problems can be found in appendix b.    the next step is the calculation of the velocities defined in the previous section . with respect to the fisher - eigen equation ( [ darwin ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath71 for the case of a quadratic potential all velocities can be calculated from the solution and with @xmath45 the following expansion is possible : @xmath72 these velocities are very similar to the velocities of the thermodynamical strategy .",
    "so it is very difficult to decide whether or not the thermodynamical strategy is faster than the biologically motivated one or vice versa .",
    "this decision depends on the particular circumstances .",
    "the thermodynamical strategy is faster than the biologically motivated one in a landscape with a slight curvature and widely extended hills whereas the biological strategy needs a landscape with a high curvature and more localized hills to be faster than the thermodynamical strategy .",
    "we note the interesting fact , that there exist special tunnel effects connected with minima of equal depth and shape .",
    "the corresponding spectrum of the hamiltonian shows degenerated eigenvalues .",
    "then under the condition of overlapping distributions located in different minima an tunnelling with high probability between these minima is possible ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , dotted line ) .",
    "for the corresponding boltzmann strategy the transformed potential does not admit this tunnelling effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , solid line ) .",
    "the dynamic equations defining boltzmann  type search and fisher  eigen type search contain a common term @xmath73 .",
    "since both types of strategies have definite advantages and disadvantages it seems desirable to mix them .",
    "we defined the dynamics of a mixed strategy by @xmath74p(\\vec{x},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath75 this dynamics reduces to a pure boltzmann strategy and for @xmath19 we obtain a fisher  eigen strategy .",
    "the mixed case may be treated by means of the ansatz @xmath76 y(\\vec{x},t)\\ ] ] which leads to the explicit solution in the eigenfunctions of the problem @xmath77\\psi_i(\\vec{x } ) \\\\",
    "e(\\vec{x } ) & = & \\gamma    u-\\frac{d\\beta}{2}\\triangle u + \\frac{d\\beta^2}{4}(\\nabla    u)\\cdot(\\nabla u ) \\nonumber \\qquad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath19 and @xmath78 we end up with the case of fisher - eigen strategies and for @xmath75 , @xmath79 the boltzmann dynamics is obtained . in this respect",
    "the mixed strategy is indeed a generalization of both cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . +     + the linearity of the differential equation leads to simple relations between the solutions and velocities .",
    "for instance the velocities for the thermodynamical and the biological strategy can be added with respect to the constant @xmath80 to get the velocities of the mixed strategy .",
    "for the solution of the problem one simply takes the solution of the thermodynamical strategy ( [ solution1 ] ) and redefines the coordinate @xmath81 by @xmath82{\\frac{\\beta^2\\ , a_k^2}{4}+\\frac{\\gamma\\ , a_k}{2d } }   \\qquad .\\ ] ] so the mixed strategy combines the advantages of both strategies if one uses a criterion to choose the coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath16 .",
    "the dependence on the 3 optimization parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath80 is a rather simple one . for a given @xmath15 ,",
    "the best strategy is evidently an increase of the @xmath16-value , since the @xmath80-dependence is weak .",
    "however , if the `` friction '' @xmath83 is fixed by the conditions , the maximization of @xmath84 leads to the smallest relaxation time .",
    "in other words , if the loss @xmath83 is fixed , maximal @xmath80 ( i.e. most competition ) and minimal @xmath16 ( i.e. large temperature ) is the best choice for a fast search of the minimum . in general",
    "the optimal search requires @xmath79 and @xmath85 . with other words , adding some amount of the `` complementary '' strategy is in most cases to be recommended .",
    "this was already found empirically in a earlier work @xcite .",
    "the study of the problem given by the potential ( [ quadratic ] ) is the same as the study of the local properties of the landscape .",
    "it is known from the lemma of morse , that there is a coordinate system so that every function with non - degenerate critical points in the neighborhood @xmath86 of one critical point @xmath87 can be expressed as @xmath88 with @xmath89 as coordinate system .",
    "the number @xmath90 is the index of the critical point .",
    "now we use the compact space @xmath91 rather than @xmath92 which in contrast to @xmath93 is homeomorphic to @xmath94 , the @xmath0-dimensional sphere . now",
    "every function over @xmath94 is non - degenerate and we obtain for the number @xmath95 of critical points with index @xmath90 the morse inequalities @xcite @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "so we find that in the case of many maxima and minima the number of saddle points increases @xcite .",
    "this is a global statement which only depends on the topology of the sphere @xmath94 .    in the case of a compact , simple - connected subset of @xmath98 one",
    "obtains a similar result because the boundary of this subset is homeomorphic to a @xmath99 dimensional sphere and the morse inequalities can be used again .",
    "if this subset has no boundary then we obtain @xmath100 and the result of @xcite can be deduced again .",
    "the treatment of constraints in the optimization problem is connected with the occurrence of holes in the space .",
    "this leads to a correction of the formulas ( [ morse1 ] ) or ( [ morse2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the number of saddle points increases with respect to the number of holes .",
    "next we want to study the influence of the landscape on the solutions in terms of the dynamics , which in our case is restricted to the influence of the potential or fitness function , respectively .",
    "the general form of this dynamics is given by @xmath101 with the selfadjoint operator @xmath102 this operator equation has the formal solution @xmath103 acting on the initial condition .",
    "with the help of ( [ ansatz2 ] ) , the operator for the fisher - eigen strategy can be reduced to @xmath104 .",
    "then both operators are in the same class known as generalized laplacian .",
    "the representation of this class from a unified point of view is possible . to this end",
    "we introduce the dirac operator as a first order differential operator and regard the generalized laplacian @xmath38 as the square of the dirac operator .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that every generalized laplacian can be represented by the square of a dirac operator with respect to a suitable clifford multiplication .",
    "for the two cases one obtains @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the dirac matrices ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 is a locally defined vector field with @xmath109\\partial_\\mu a_\\nu ( x)=-i u(x)$ ] . together with the expression @xmath110 for every dirac operator @xmath15",
    ", one can simple calculate the squares of the dirac operators to establish @xmath111 with the adjoint operator @xmath112 .",
    "this means that both problems can be described by the motion of a fermion in a field @xmath113 or @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the equilibrium state ( or stationary state ) is given by the kernel of the operator @xmath38 which is the direct sum @xmath115 . if the dimension @xmath0 is even , which is always true for the high - dimensional case , this splitting can be introduced by the product of all @xmath80-matrices usually denoted by @xmath116 . because of the compactness of the underlying space @xmath94 , the kernel of @xmath38 is finite - dimensional and the spectrum is discrete .",
    "we note , that the spectrum of both , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , is equal up to the kernel .",
    "so the interesting information about the problem is located in the asymmetric splitting of the kernel @xmath119 .",
    "the physical interpretation is given by an asymmetric ground state of the problem which is only connected to the geometry of the landscape .",
    "in more mathematical terms both dirac operators are described as covariant derivatives with a suitable connection . together with the fiber bundle theory @xcite and the classification given by the k - theory @xcite one obtains a possible classification of the fitness landscapes in dependence of convergence velocities given by the periodicity of the real k - theory with period 8 .",
    "each of these 8 classes describes a splitting of the kernel @xmath119 and leads to a different velocity .",
    "a complete description of this problem will be published later on .",
    "in physics the most classical dynamical processes follow the principle of minimization of a physical quantity which often leads to an extremum of the action functional .",
    "this problem frequently has a finite number of solutions given by the solutions of a differential equation also known as the equation of motion .",
    "investigating this fact in relation to optimization processes , one obtains in the simplest case the thermodynamical and the biological strategy .",
    "the description is given by the distribution of the searcher and a dynamics of the distribution converging to an equilibrium distribution located around the optimum of the optimization problem .",
    "with the help of the kinetics and the eigenfunction expansion , we investigated both strategies in view of the convergence velocity . in principle",
    "both strategies are equal because one obtains a stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "but , the main difference is the transformation of the fitness function ( or potential ) from @xmath120 to @xmath121 ( see ( [ trafo ] ) ) in the case of the thermodynamical strategy .",
    "the difference of both strategies leads to the idea of adding a small amount of the `` complementary '' strategy in order to hope for an improvement .",
    "the difference in the velocity on the one hand and the similarity in the equation on the other look like a unified treatment of both strategies under consideration .",
    "this is represented in the last section in the formalism of fiber bundles and heat kernels to get the interesting result , that up to local coordinate transformations the strategies are split into 8 different classes .",
    "for the case of quadratic potentials ( [ quadratic ] ) the problem ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) may be solved explicitly . we get the eigenvalues @xmath122 and the eigenfunctions @xmath123 which lead to the solution",
