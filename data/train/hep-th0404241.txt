    "cosmological models with scalar field matter have been much studied in the context of inflation and , more recently , in the context of the late - time acceleration that is indicated by current astronomical observations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one theoretical motivation for these studies is that scalar fields arise naturally from the compactification of higher - dimensional theories , such as string or m - theory .",
    "however , the type of scalar field potential obtained in these compactifications is sufficiently restrictive that until recently it was considered to be difficult to get accelerating cosmologies in this way , although the existence of an accelerating phase in a hyperbolic ( @xmath13 ) universe obtained by compactification had been noted @xcite , and non - perturbative effects in m - theory have since been shown to allow unstable de sitter vacua @xcite .    in an earlier paper , we pointed out that compactification on a compact hyperbolic manifold with a time - dependent volume modulus naturally leads to a flat ( @xmath14 ) expanding universe that undergoes a transient period of accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "numerous subsequent studies have shown that such cosmological solutions are typical to all compactifications that involve compact hyperbolic spaces or non - vanishing @xmath15-form field strengths ( flux ) @xcite , and this was additionally confirmed in a systematic study @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the transient acceleration in these models is easily understood @xcite in terms of the positive scalar field potential that both hyperbolic and flux compactifications produce in the effective , lower - dimensional , action .",
    "this perspective also makes clear the generic nature of transient acceleration .    for",
    "any realistic application one would want the lower - dimensional spacetime to be four - dimensional , but for theoretical studies it is useful to consider a general @xmath16-dimensional spacetime . assuming that we have gravity , described by a metric @xmath17 , coupled to @xmath18 scalar fields @xmath19 taking values in a riemannian target space with metric @xmath20 and with potential energy @xmath1",
    ", the effective action must take the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ( spacetime ) ricci scalar .",
    "we are interested in solutions of the field equations of the action ( [ action ] ) for which the line element has the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) form for a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime . in standard",
    "coordinates , @xmath23 where the function @xmath24 is the scale factor , and @xmath25 represents the @xmath26-dimensional spatial sections of constant curvature @xmath27 .",
    "we normalise @xmath27 such that it may take values @xmath28 for a riemann tensor @xmath29 with metric @xmath30 on @xmath31 .",
    "the scalar fields are taken to depend only on time , which is the only choice compatible with the symmetries of flrw spacetimes .",
    "the universe is expanding if @xmath32 and accelerating if @xmath33 .",
    "we need only discuss expanding cosmologies because contracting cosmologies are obtained by time - reversal .    in some simple cases ,",
    "the target space has a one - dimensional factor parametrised by a dilaton field @xmath34 , and the potential takes the form @xmath35 for some ` dilaton coupling ' constant @xmath36 and constant @xmath37 .",
    "this model is of special interest , in part because of its amenability to analysis .",
    "the special case for which the dilaton is the _ only _ scalar field was analysed many years ago ( for @xmath38 ) using the observation that , for an appropriate choice of time variable , cosmological solutions correspond to trajectories in the ` phase - plane ' parametrised by the first time - derivatives of the dilaton and the scale factor @xcite .",
    "this method ( which has recently been extended to potentials that are the sum of two exponentials @xcite ) allows a simple visualisation of all possible cosmological trajectories .",
    "moreover , all trajectories for flat cosmologies can be found explicitly @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and a related method allows a visualisation of their global nature @xcite . it was noted in @xcite that there is both a ` critical ' and a ` hypercritical ' value of the dilaton coupling constant @xmath36 , at which the set of trajectories undergoes a qualitative change . in spacetime dimension",
    "@xmath16 , these values are @xcite @xmath39 below the critical value ( @xmath40 ) there exists a late - time attractor universe undergoing accelerating expansion , whereas only transient acceleration is possible above it .",
    "the hypercritical coupling ( @xmath41 ) separates ` steep ' exponential potentials ( which arise in flux compactifications ) and ` gentle ' exponential potentials ( which arise from hyperbolic compactification , in which case @xmath42 so the potential is still too steep to allow eternal acceleration ) .",
    "one aim of this paper is to generalise this type of analysis to the multi - scalar case . for @xmath14 ,",
    "this has been done already for what could be called a ` multi - dilaton ' model @xcite , and for the multi - scalar model with exponential potential ( [ eq.exppot ] ) @xcite . here",
    "we consider _ all _ cosmological trajectories ( arbitrary @xmath27 ) for an exponential potential of either sign , and for any spacetime dimension @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , we find exact solutions for all flat cosmologies when @xmath43 , following the method used in @xcite for @xmath44 , and the exact phase - plane trajectories for all @xmath27 when @xmath45 .",
    "a more ambitious aim of this paper is to determine what can be said about cosmologies with more general scalar potentials . what kind of model - independent behaviour can one expect , and how generic is the phenomenon of transient acceleration ?",
    "exponential potentials are simple partly because of the power - law attractor cosmologies that they permit , but such simple solutions do not occur for other potentials so other methods are needed . in this paper",
    ", we develop an alternative method of visualising cosmological solutions that applies to _ any _ potential , and we illustrate it by an application to exponential potentials .",
    "as we explain , exponential potentials serve as ` reference potentials ' in determining the late - time behaviour of cosmologies arising in a large class of models with other potentials .",
    "our starting point for the new formalism is the observation @xcite that flat cosmological solutions of gravity coupled to @xmath18 scalar fields with @xmath5 can be viewed as null geodesics in an ` augmented ' target space of dimension @xmath46 with a metric of lorentzian signature ( see @xcite for related results )",
    ". trajectories in this space corresponding to non - flat cosmologies are neither null nor geodesic .",
    "however , we will see that they are projections of null geodesics in a ` doubly - augmented ' target space with a metric of signature @xmath47 for @xmath13 and signature @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that the extension of these results to @xmath50 is very simple .",
    "flat cosmologies are again geodesics in the augmented target space but with respect to a conformally rescaled metric ; the geodesic is timelike if @xmath44 and spacelike if @xmath43 .",
    "null geodesics are unaffected by the conformal rescaling and hence continue to correspond to ( @xmath14 ) cosmologies for @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of acceleration is also simple in this framework : within the lightcone is an ` acceleration cone ' , and if a geodesic enters its acceleration cone then the corresponding universe will accelerate . in the case of a flat target space with an exponential potential , the fixed point",
    "geodesics are just straight lines , and the universe is accelerating if the straight line lies within the acceleration cone .",
    "the further extension to @xmath51 cosmologies is achieved exactly as in the @xmath5 case .",
    "cosmological trajectories are projections of geodesics in the doubly - augmented target space with respect to a conformally rescaled metric of signature @xmath47 for @xmath13 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the geodesic is timelike if @xmath44 , null if @xmath5 and spacelike if @xmath43 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",

    "we discuss the phase - plane trajectories and present some exact @xmath43 solutions . in section [ sec.manifold ]",
    "we develop the interpretation of multi - scalar cosmologies as geodesic motion . in section [ sec.applications ]",
    "we introduce the notion of the acceleration cone , and we show how the cosmologies arising in exponential - potential models fit into the new framework ; other potentials of current interest are also considered .",
    "we summarise in section [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the equations of motion for multi - scalar cosmologies that follow from the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "these equations will be given in two different forms , distinguished by the choice of time coordinate .",
    "the second form will be useful to our analysis in the next section of possible ` fixed points ' , which correspond to power - law cosmologies in the first form .    to simplify the equations we define @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the levi - civit connection for the target space metric @xmath54 , and we introduce the following ` characteristic functions ' of the potential v : @xmath55 these are the components of a 1-form on the target space dual to a vector field @xmath56 . in a vector notation",
    ", the scalar field equation can now be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the hubble function .",
    "the friedmann constraint is @xmath59 = \\left(d-1\\right)\\alpha_c^{-2}k,\\ ] ] where the norm @xmath60 ( and hence the inner product ) is the one induced by the target space metric : @xmath61 .",
    "differentiating the friedmann constraint , and using the scalar field equation ( [ eq.sca ] ) , we deduce the ` acceleration equation ' @xmath62 is the ` critical ' constant given in ( [ exponents ] ) .",
    "clearly , acceleration is possible only if @xmath44 .",
    "note too that @xmath63 can not vanish unless either @xmath43 or @xmath64 ( or @xmath5 , @xmath14 and @xmath65 ) so only in these cases can an expanding universe recollapse .    for the following section , it will prove useful to rewrite the above equations in terms of a new time coordinate @xmath66 , defined as a function of @xmath67 by the relation @xmath68 note that we have allowed for the possibility that @xmath6 , although @xmath5 is excluded .",
    "we will also set @xmath69 in terms of the variable @xmath70 , the condition @xmath71 for expansion is @xmath72 , while the condition @xmath73 for acceleration is @xmath74 where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath75 .    in the new time",

    "as expected , it can be satisfied only if @xmath44 .",
    "we now wish to determine whether the system of equations ( [ newscalar ] , [ accelerationeq ] ) subject to the constraint ( [ newfried ] ) , admits any fixed point solutions for which @xmath81 we shall see that these conditions are consistent only for exponential potentials , for which the equations ( [ newscalar ] , [ accelerationeq ] ) become those of an autonomous dynamical system , and we determine the fixed points and their type for all @xmath16 , @xmath27 and for either sign of the potential . for this analysis ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the quantity @xmath82 recall that @xmath83 is the ` hypercritical ' constant given in ( [ exponents ] ) .      given @xmath84 , equation ( [ newscalar ] ) yields @xmath85 where @xmath86 solves the quadratic equation @xmath87 given @xmath88 , equation ( [ accelerationeq ] ) yields @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left(d-2\\right)c^2a^2 + { 1\\over2}\\left(d-1\\right ) \\left(d-2\\right)\\left[\\dot\\beta^2 - ca^2 \\dot\\beta \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ cterms ] ) to get to the second line .",
    "using this equation to eliminate the @xmath90 term from ( [ quadc ] ) we arrive at the quadratic equation @xmath91 there are therefore two types of fixed point :    * @xmath92 . using this in ( [ quadc ] ) we deduce that @xmath93 and that @xmath94 this requires @xmath95 and @xmath96 it then follows that @xmath97 this is just the friedmann constraint for @xmath14 , so this type of fixed point occurs only for @xmath14 .",

    "the above results are in complete analogy with those of @xcite for the one - scalar case . to see why",
    ", it should first be appreciated that the fixed point conditions have been derived on the assumption that @xmath106 is constant , and that @xmath107 is covariantly constant .",
    "it then follows from ( [ cterms ] , [ quadc ] ) that @xmath56 must be covariantly constant too .",

    "if the reduced target space is not flat then a connection term must be added to the last equation in ( [ autonomous ] ) .",
    "as this introduces dependence on @xmath113 , the equations no longer define an autonomous dynamical system in just @xmath46 variables .",
    "it is not clear how much difference this makes to the results : note that the connection term has no effect on the stability of fixed points with @xmath118 because it is quadratic in @xmath120 .",
    "however , we will suppose for the analysis to follow that the reduced target space _ is _ flat . we may then assume with no essential loss of generality that it is also one - dimensional ( i.e. @xmath121 ) so we have an autonomous dynamical system for just three variables .",

    "for @xmath132 we have a saddle , with one real - negative and two real - positive eigenvalues ; the instability due to the positive eigenvalues is what leads to the ` flatness problem ' of standard big - bang cosmology .",

    "the behaviour of a @xmath49 trajectory is determined by its relation to the separatrix of the unstable @xmath49 fixed point ( which is the einstein static universe for @xmath157 ) ; those on one side approach the @xmath14 fixed point while those on the other side represent universes that recollapse to a big crunch .",

    "the @xmath13 fixed point is an attractor spiral so that all @xmath13 trajectories spiral around a point of zero - acceleration ; as observed in @xcite , this leads to eternal oscillation between acceleration and deceleration .",
    "for @xmath43 the @xmath14 trajectories were studied in @xcite but there seems to be no complete study of all trajectories for this case .",
    "we will therefore present some results of the one - scalar model for @xmath43 before moving on to discuss modifications that arise in the multi - scalar case .",

    "note that the line determined by ( [ direction.nonzerok ] ) is a generator of the acceleration cone ( as expected from the zero - acceleration property of the @xmath51 fixed point ) .",

    "generic geodesics , corresponding to generic @xmath14 cosmologies , are not straight lines in the extended target space , but they still have a simple description . the regime where the solutions are dominated by kinetic energy is given by geodesics with tangent vectors having large @xmath272 .",

    "if @xmath273 , then the geodesic ultimately approaches a null straight - line geodesic .",
    "for the single - scalar case , this behaviour is shown in figure [ fig.k0geodesics ] .",

    "to demonstrate this , we discuss the case of flat cosmologies with positive potentials . in this case",
    ", the scalar fields must approach @xmath277 at late times , where some components of the constant @xmath18-vector @xmath278 may be infinite .",
    "the characteristic functions of the potential in this limit are also constant : @xmath279 the absolute value @xmath280 determines the late - time behaviour , by comparison with the critical and hypercritical exponents : if @xmath281 , then there will be late - time acceleration , with the trajectory approaching an approximate accelerating attractor ; obvious examples are models for which @xmath195 has a strictly positive lower bound , so most models of interest will be those for which @xmath195 either tends to zero or has a minimum at zero . for @xmath282 , there is late - time deceleration corresponding to the existence of an approximate late - time decelerating attractor .",
    "the asymptotic geodesics in both these cases are timelike . in contrast , for @xmath283 the timelike geodesic asymptotes a null ( and hence decelerating ) trajectory .    to illustrate the above observations , we consider the following single - scalar examples .    * inverse power law potentials : @xmath284 these potentials have been much studied in quintessence models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they also arise from dynamical breaking of supersymmetry @xcite . with @xmath285 ,",
    "one finds @xmath286 .",
    "this implies late - time acceleration , _ even though the potential tends to zero at late - times_. * that any other value of @xmath287 may occur is illustrated by the potential @xmath288 for which @xmath289 if we suppose that @xmath290 at late times . for such cosmologies the asymptotic behaviour is the same as it would be in the exponential potential model with dilaton coupling constant @xmath36 .",
    "* it may happen that at late times the scalar fields become trapped near a minimum of the potential .",
    "near such a minimum , which we may assume to occur at the origin of field space , the potential takes the form @xmath291 for integer @xmath292 .",
    "for positive @xmath293 one finds @xmath294 which tends to zero ( i.e. @xmath286 ) as @xmath295 for any @xmath296 .",
    "this implies late - time acceleration , due to the effective cosmological constant @xmath293 .",
    "however , we may now consider the limit @xmath297 , in which case @xmath298 , implying that the late - time trajectory is null , and hence decelerating .",
    "in this paper we have developed a geometrical method for the classification and visualisation of homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi - scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential @xmath195 .",
    "the method involves two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the target space parametrised by the @xmath18 scalar fields is augmented to a larger @xmath205-dimensional space of lorentzian signature , the logarithm of the scale factor playing the role of time .",
    "this is reminiscent of the role of the scale factor in mini - superspace models of quantum cosmology , especially if one views the scalar fields of our model as moduli - fields for extra dimensions . in this case",
    ", the lorentzian metric on the augmented target space is the one induced from the wheeler - dewitt metric on the space of higher - dimensional metrics .",
    "this was the point of view adopted in @xcite , where it was also observed that when @xmath5 all flat ( @xmath14 ) cosmologies are null geodesics in this metric ( an observation that goes back to work of dewitt on kasner metrics @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath50 , flat cosmologies again correspond to trajectories in the augmented target space but they are neither null nor geodesic",
    ". however , as we have shown , _ all _ flat cosmologies are geodesics with respect to a _ conformally rescaled _ metric on the augmented target space , the conformal factor depending both on the scale factor and the potential .",
    "the conformal rescaling has no effect on null geodesics , of course , so flat cosmologies are still null geodesics whenever @xmath5 , but now the trajectories of flat cosmologies are timelike geodesics when @xmath44 and spacelike geodesics when @xmath43 .",
    "this is true not only for a potential of fixed sign but also for one that changes sign ; in this case the tangent to the geodesic becomes null just as the scalar fields take values for which @xmath5 .",
    "the second step , which is needed for non - flat ( @xmath299 ) cosmologies , is to further enlarge the target space to a ` doubly - augmented ' target space foliated by copies of the augmented target space .",
    "one can choose the metric on this space , of signature @xmath47 for @xmath13 and @xmath48 for @xmath300 and degenerate for @xmath14 , such that geodesics yield ( on projection ) cosmological trajectories for _ any _ @xmath27 when projected onto a given hypersurface , and the geodesics are again timelike , null or spacelike according to whether @xmath195 is positive , zero or negative .",
    "this general construction thus includes all the previous ones as special cases .",
    "accelerating cosmologies have a simple interpretation in this new framework . within the lightcone ( defined by the metric with respect to which the trajectories are geodesics )",
    "there is an acceleration subcone .",
    "a given trajectory corresponds to an accelerating universe whenever its tangent vector lies within the acceleration cone . in particular",
    ", a flat cosmology undergoes acceleration whenever its geodesic trajectory bends into the acceleration cone within the lightcone of the augmented target space .",
    "this can happen only if the trajectory is timelike , which it will be if the potential is positive .",
    "we have also presented in this paper a complete treatment ( complementing many previous studies ) of cosmological trajectories , for any @xmath27 and any spacetime dimension @xmath16 , for the special case of simple exponential potentials .",
    "these potentials are characterised by a sign ( the potential may be positive or negative ) and a ( dilaton ) coupling constant @xmath36 ( the magnitude of an @xmath18-vector coupling constant @xmath56 ) . as has long been appreciated @xcite , cosmological solutions in such models",
    "correspond , for an appropriate choice of time parameter , to trajectories of an autonomous dynamical system in a ` phase space ' parametrised by the time - derivatives of the scale factor and scalar fields .",
    "the qualitative features of these trajectories ( which should not be confused with trajectories in the ` augmented target space ' parametrized by the fields themselves ) are determined by the position and nature of any fixed points , which are of two types .",
    "there is always a @xmath14 fixed point unless @xmath41 ( the ` hypercritical ' value of @xmath36 defined by this property ) but it occurs only for @xmath44 if @xmath133 and only for @xmath43 if @xmath133 .",
    "there is also a @xmath51 fixed point if @xmath44 , which coincides with the @xmath14 fixed point when @xmath102 , where @xmath301 is the ` critical ' value of @xmath36 ( defined as the value at which fixed point cosmologies have zero acceleration ) .",
    "these fixed point cosmologies have a very simple interpretation as trajectories in the augmented target space : they are straight lines . in the @xmath14 case",
    "these lines are also geodesics . for @xmath43",
    "these geodesic lines lie outside the lightcone . for @xmath44",
    "they lie inside the lightcone , but may lie either inside or outside the acceleration cone . for models obtained by ( classical ) compactification from a higher dimensional theory without a scalar field potential , the @xmath14",
    "geodesic line always lies outside the acceleration cone , so only transient acceleration is possible in these models . for a single scalar field",
    "the transient acceleration is generic in the sense that it is a feature of all @xmath14 trajectories when @xmath133 and of some when @xmath156 .",
    "in contrast , in the multi - scalar case , there are trajectories that correspond to eternally decelerating universes even when @xmath133 , so transient acceleration is less generic for more than one scalar field .",
    "although exponential potentials are of limited phenomenological value , they are important as ` reference potentials ' in determining the asymptotic behaviour of cosmologies in models with other potentials , such as inverse power potentials . essentially , any potential that falls to zero slower than the critical exponential potential ( as do inverse power potentials ) will lead to late - time eternal acceleration .",
    "any potential that falls to zero faster than the hypercritical exponential potential will have a late - time behaviour that is approximately that of a model with zero potential .",
    "of course , there is no evidence for the existence of cosmological scalar fields , but there _ is _ evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and hence for dark energy .",
    "whatever produces this energy , it seems reasonable to suppose that it can be modeled by scalar fields .",
    "if so , it is possible that future observations may be interpreted as telling us something about the potential energy of these fields . in view of our current complete ignorance of what this potential",
    "might be , we have tried , as much as possible , to understand generic properties , and we hope that the methods developed here will be of further use in this respect .",
    "the interpretation of solutions of gravitational theories as geodesics in a suitable metric space has a considerable history of which we were mostly unaware at the time of writing this paper .",
    "the geodesic interpretation of @xmath14 cosmologies that we have presented is closely related to the maupertuis - jacobi principle of classical mechanics .",
    "relatively recent work on this topic includes @xcite",
