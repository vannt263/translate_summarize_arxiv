    "the first direct detection of gravitational waves by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite opened up a new way to observe the universe . along with gravitational wave detection , it was the first direct observation of binary black holes . with this success , there are many hopes that other previously invisible cosmological objects , which emit or scatter gravitational waves , will be observed in the near future .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility to detect cosmic strings  topological defects that may have been formed in the early universe @xcite  by means of wave effects in the gravitational lensing taking into account the interference and diffraction .",
    "we emphasize the difference of wave diffraction on a topological defect from that on a compact object .",
    "for the wave effects to be detectable in a compact - mass gravitational lens , the wavelength @xmath0 should be comparable or larger than the schwarzchild radius @xmath1 of the lens @xcite . in this case",
    ", the fresnel number , which is the key parameter for the diffraction , is given by @xmath2 , and the diffraction scales like @xmath3 .",
    "this scaling can not be applied to a string , a non - compact object with conical topology .",
    "it has been shown recently for the plane - wave diffraction by string @xcite , that the fresnel number is determined by the ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the string to the observer and @xmath6 is a constant related to the deficit angle of conical space , which is proportional to the linear mass of the string @xcite .",
    "for the typical @xmath7 , low fresnel numbers can be achieved at cosmological distances from the string , @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", the diffraction effects can be of the same order as the geometrical optics giving an additional amplification at the observation point @xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the conical topology , for which the metric is locally flat , but globally it forces the parallel geodesics to cross ( when they pass on opposite sides of the string ) at a large distance . on the other hand , the deflection angle , equal to @xmath6 ,",
    "is independent of the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "hence , the characteristic fringe width in the interference pattern @xmath9 does not vary with distance .",
    "this is another feature distinct from the compact - object lens , for which the interference fringe scales with distance as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we study the question of how the fresnel diffraction zones emerge under wave propagation in conical spacetime created by a straight cosmic string .",
    "the diffraction pattern we have obtained is quite different from what one would expect from light scattered off a thin wire or slit @xcite , since the cosmic string , as a topological defect , gives no shadow .",
    "after an appropriately chosen coordinate transformation , we transform the problem of a single - source wave in a curved space to that of a flat space with two image sources illuminating two virtual half - plane screens . as a result",
    ", we obtain the whole interference and diffraction picture analytically .",
    "second , we take into account the curvature of the incident wavefront by considering the wave source at a finite distance from the string .",
    "this is a more general case with respect to our previous study @xcite . by applying the uniform asymptotic theory of diffraction @xcite ,",
    "we obtain analytical solutions for the wave field in the whole space including the lines of singularities at the boundaries of the double - imaging region . away from the boundaries ,",
    "the wave field is interpreted in the framework of keller s geometrical theory of diffraction @xcite , which has demonstrated to be quite efficient in studying diffraction on a topological defect @xcite .",
    "our results allow to predict with high accuracy the location of the diffraction maxima both in coordinate space and in energy spectrum , along with the nodal and antinodal lines of geometrical - optics interference .",
    "we found it convenient to associate the diffraction maxima with what we call the `` fresnel observation zones '' , that help to localize the regions where the amplifcation due to the string is the highest and easier to observe .",
    "the boundaries between the zones are determined by hyperbolas in an equivalent flat space . in the limit of an infinitely distant source ( incident pane wave ) , the hyperbolas convert to parabolas , all with a common focus at the string .",
    "we start with a spacetime metric for a static cylindrically symmetric cosmic string @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the linear mass density of the string lying along the @xmath14-axis , ( @xmath15 ) are cylindrical coordinates , and the system of units in which the speed of light @xmath16 is assumed . with a new angular coordinate @xmath17",
    ", the metric takes a minkowskian form @xmath18 which is locally flat , but it globally has a conical topology , since a wedge of angular size @xmath19 is taken out from flat space and the two faces of the wedge are identified @xcite . by introducing the deficit angle @xmath20 with @xmath21 the angular coordinate @xmath22 spans the range @xmath23 .",
    "we consider the question of finding a solution of the wave equation in background corresponding to a time harmonic source , situated at a finite distance from the string .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in order to keep the problem two - dimensional , we consider a line source parallel to the string .",
    "our aim is to see how a wave emitted by a line source is diffracted in conical spacetime .",
    "the wave equation in background for the scalar field @xmath24 is ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath25 where we denoted @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that eq .",
    "is valid for electromagnetic waves , as well as for gravitational waves ( in an appropriately chosen gauge ) when the effect of gravitational lensing on polarization is negligible and both types of waves can be described by a scalar field @xcite . consider a line source @xmath27 located at @xmath28 and emitting a cylindrical wave described by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a normalization constant and @xmath31 is the hankel function of the first kind which satisfies the helmholtz equation and corresponds to an outward - propagating solution @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous to perform the angular transformation @xmath32 and to work in the minkowskian background with a wedge removed rather than in the curved spacetime , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for an infinitely distant source . to conveniently perform the transformation , we put the origin at the string location @xmath33 and join the point @xmath33 with the emitting source @xmath27 by a radial line [ see fig .  [",

    "then we assign the values @xmath34 to the left and @xmath35 to the right of the line @xmath36 that will be the cut line . assuming that the emitting wave is symmetrical ( isotropic )",
    ", we obtain a zero derivative @xmath37 at the cut . after the angular transformation , the line @xmath36 converts to the wedge @xmath38 , @xmath39 , given by the angles @xmath40",

    ", each emitting source lies on the coresponding face of the wedge .",

    "the residual @xmath59 can be determined by the method of asymptotic matching @xcite which consists in comparing the uniform asymptotics with the nonuniform asymptotics of the rigorous solution and expanding all the terms with respect to inverse powers of @xmath60 .",
    "the nonuniform expansion can be written as @xmath61 here , the first term is the geometrical - optics contribution of the incident wave .",

    "it should also be remarked that the diffraction coefficient @xmath68 is determined by the geometry of the obstacle ( a half plane in our case ) but is independent of the type of incident wave @xcite .    to do the asymptotic matching , the fresnel integral is replaced with its asymptotics at large arguments @xcite @xmath69 by comparing eqs .   and",

    ", one can write the final solution @xmath72 written in this form , the solution corresponds to the uniform asymptotic theory introduced in ref .",
    "it is called uniform since the poles in the diffraction coefficient @xmath68 are canceled out by the poles in the term @xmath73 , giving a regular solution in the whole space including the light - shadow boundary",

    "far from the light - shadow boundary , both asymptotics , the nonuniform and uniform one , coincide .",
    "we also observe that the edge wave has a phase shift of @xmath77 in the illuminated region and @xmath78 in the shadow with respect to the incident field .",
    "crossing the shadow line introduces a phase change of @xmath79 , which is manifested in the sign change of the diffraction coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath80 ( see the original work by fresnel @xcite who pointed out that the diffracted waves in the shadow and illuminated regions are in complete phase opposition ) .",
    "as explained in sect .  [ sect : wave - eq ] , after an angular transformation , the curved background can be equivalently represented by the flat background with a wedge of @xmath20 removed . according to the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : split](b ) , the wave source @xmath27 is doubled into images @xmath43 , @xmath44 which are located on the faces of the wedge .",
    "each image source emits a cylindrical wave that will be diffracted by the corresponding half plane .",
    "therefore , the wave diffraction by a string can be thought of as the diffraction by two half planes forming an angle of @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the fresnel - zone concept has been widely used in various branches of wave physics . when the wave field is calculated at a certain observation point , it is advantageous to divide an incoming wavefront into a number of zones , each with an additional path difference of a half - wavelength , so that the wavefront phase changes by @xmath79 when moving from one zone to the next @xcite .",
    "the construction of these zones provides a pictorial understanding of the diffraction phenomenon .",
    "indeed , when some of the zones are obstructed by a screen or any other obstacle , the fresnel zones are used to determine qualitatively when the diffraction effects become important and the geometrical optics limit is not accurate to estimate the resulting field .",
    "for example , when radio waves propagate in terrain environment , fresnel zones are elliptic - shaped regions surrounding the line - of - sight path from source to receiver @xcite . to achieve an acceptable transmission not affected by diffraction or multipath attenuation ,",
    "all disturbing objects must be further than 0.6 times the first fresnel zone radius from the line - of - sight path @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that diffraction may appear in the absence of screens or obstacles which might obstruct the direct wave transmission . as fresnel pointed out in his classical work @xcite , in order to produce the phenomena of diffraction ``",

    "for the problem of transmission of a signal from the emitter @xmath27 to the observer @xmath91 , the fresnel zones can be constructed about the line of sight @xmath103 connecting the points . in this case , the relevant geometry is a set of confocal elliptic - shaped regions with the foci at the points @xmath27 and @xmath91 @xcite . indeed , when any obstacle @xmath33 is not far from the line of sight , an alternative path @xmath104 interferes with the direct path @xmath103 resulting in constructive or destructive interference .",

    "a qualitative analysis of eq .   shows that in the most interesting situation , when the observer is in the double - imaging region , the diffraction pattern will be determined by the interference of four characteristic waves : two go waves coming from the sources and two d waves emanating from the edge [ fig .",
