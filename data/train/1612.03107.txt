    "the elliptical ring - like structure is arrowed.,width=302 ]    it is well known that planetary nebulae ( pne ) originate from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb stars with low- and intermediate - mass ( @xmath5 810m@xmath6 ) main - sequence progenitors once the central star becomes hot enough to photoionize the envelope ejected during the agb phase .",
    "it is also well known that this process , when applied to single star evolution , can hardly explain the dramatic transformation of a spherical agb envelope into the varied and complex morphologies observed in a noticeable number of pne ( e.g. , balick & frank 2002 ) .    during many years",
    "the formation of pne has been understood within the interacting stellar wind model ( isw ; kwok , purton & fitzgeral 1978 ; balick 1987 ) .",
    "this model has probed its ability to explain many of the features observed in pne ( balick & frank 2002 , and references therein ) . however , multiple , highly collimated , and axisymmetric structures in pne have always presented difficulties to be explained within the isw scenario .",
    "nowadays , in addition to wind - wind interaction , it is recognized that the formation of complex pne requires the action of collimated outflows that distort an originally spherical agb envelope ( sahai & trauger 1998 ) . in this",
    "context , binary central stars were always though to be determining in the formation of complex pne ( e.g. , morris 1981 ; soker & livio 1994 ) .",
    "the importance of binary central stars in pn formation is receiving strong support with the detection of new post - common envelope binary central stars associated to complex pne ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009 ; miszalski 2012 ; jones 2016 ; and references therein ) .",
    "evolution through a common - envelope provides many of basic ingredients though to be involved in the formation of complex pne , as accretion disks , highly collimated outflows , and magnetic fields ( garca - segura et al .",
    "1999 ; dennis et al . 2008",
    "; de marco 2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "nowadays , about 3500 pne are known in the galaxy ( parker , bojii & frew 2016 ) .",
    "however , many of them still lack an analysis that allow us to place them within the evolutionary sequence and to carry out comparisons with other pne , which could provide information to disetangle the possible key processes involved in the formation of the different kinds of pne . given the enormous variety of properties ( e.g. , morphology , kinematics , chemical abundances , physical conditions ) exhibited by pne , increasing the number of well analyzed objects may contribute to shed light on the processes involved in the agb to pn transition .",
    "k4 - 37 ( png066.9 + 02.2 ; @xmath7(2000.0 ) = @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ; @xmath11(2000.0 ) = @xmath12 02@xmath13 29@xmath14 ) is a pn that has never been analyzed in detail .",
    "it was discovered by kohoutek ( 1965 ) and its pn nature can be guessed from the emission line fluxes listed in the strasbourg eso catalog ( acker et al .",
    "according to this catalog , the nebula presents very strong [ nii ] and [ sii ] , moderate [ oiii ] , and absent heii@xmath154686 emission lines , indicating a very low - excitation pn . except for these data , information about the characteristics and properties of k4 - 37 is lacking in the published literature .",
    "the object was imaged by us many years ago in our programs to study compact pne ( e.g. , miranda et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 , 2001 ; vzquez et al .",
    "2002 ) , and it showed a simple and less interesting bipolar morphology . however , the acquisition and analysis of new data , and inspection of the wise archive have revealed noticeable properties in this pn . in this paper",
    "we present the data , analysis , and results that we have obtained for k4 - 37 .",
    "narrow - band images of k4 - 37 were obtained during 1998 july 7 - 9 with cafos at the calar alto observatory . the detector was loral 2k@xmath32k ccd with a plate scale of 0.33arcsecpixel@xmath16 .",
    "three filters were used : h@xmath7 ( fwhm = 15 ) , [ nii ] ( fwhm = 19 ) , and [ oiii ] ( fwhm = 25 ) .",
    "exposure time was 600s for each filter .",
    "the spatial resolution , determined by the fwhm of field stars , is 1.2arcsec in the h@xmath7 and [ nii ] images and 3arcsec in the [ oiii ] one .",
    "additional narrow - band images were obtained also with cafos in 2014 june 4 using an h@xmath7+[nii ] filter ( fwhm = 50 ) and an exposure time of 3@xmath3600s , and in 2016 may 3 using an [ oiii ] filter ( fwhm = 25 ) and an exposure time of 2@xmath3900s . in 2014 and 2016",
    "the detector was a site 2k@xmath32k ccd with a plate scale of 0.53arcsecpixel@xmath16 .",
    "the fwhm of the field stars in the h@xmath7+[nii ] image is 0.9arcsec , lower than twice the pixel size , suggesting that the true spatial resolution of this image is better than 0.9arcsec . in the 2016 [ oiii ] image ,",
    "the spatial resolution is 1.4arcsec .",
    "the images were cosmic - ray cleaned , bias subtracted and flat fielded using standard routines within the midas package .",
    "to gain a better view of the morphology of k4 - 37 , we have used the richardson - lucy algorithm in the midas package , to deconvolve the h@xmath7+[nii ] image .",
    "a well exposed field star in the image was used as point - spread - function , and iteration was stopped when artifacts appeared in the deconvolved image .",
    "after 30 iterations , we obtained a deconvolved h@xmath7+[nii ] image with a spatial resolution of @xmath10.5arcsec .",
    "the 1998 h@xmath7 and [ nii ] images together with the 2016 [ oiii ] image are shown in figure1 .",
    "the original and deconvolved h@xmath7+[nii ] images are presented in figure2 .",
    "the nebula show a bipolar shape with a size of @xmath112@xmath36.5arcsec@xmath4 in h@xmath7 and [ nii ] , somewhat smaller in [ oiii ] , and the major axis oriented at pa @xmath1@xmath1740@xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , faint emission can be detected in a @xmath118@xmath311arcsec@xmath4 area .",
    "the images show a point - symmetric intensity distribution in the bipolar lobes approximately along the north - south direction .",
    "a torus traces the equatorial plane of the nebula , which contains two bright knots located symmetrically with respect to the center of the object and oriented at pa @xmath160@xmath18 . due to the point - symmetric regions of the lobes",
    ", the axis of the torus seems to be oriented close to the east - west direction .",
    "however , the deconvolved h@xmath7+[nii ] image does show that its axis is oriented similarly to that of the bipolar lobes .",
    "the size of the torus is @xmath14@xmath32arcsec@xmath4 and some distortions can be recognized towards its southeastern side .",
    "more details about the morphology of k4 - 37 can be recognized in the original and deconvolved h@xmath7+[nii ] images ( fig.2 ) .",
    "these images show a noticeably limb - brightening and a knotty structure in the bipolar lobes .",
    "moreover , the northwestern lobe is clearly distorted or broken towards the west where an elongated feature is observed up to @xmath17.3arcsec from the center , which clearly deviates from the lobe geometry .",
    "an eastern counterpart can not be recognized in the southeastern lobe ( fig.2 ) but we note that the region along pa @xmath190@xmath18 protrudes and does not follow the lobe geometry .",
    "in fact , the southeastern lobe can be traced up to @xmath15.7arcsec from the center along pa @xmath190@xmath18 whereas it extends only @xmath14arcsec at pa @xmath1180@xmath18 .",
    "the distorted regions subtend an angle of @xmath130@xmath18 as seen from the center . from the images in fig.2",
    "two different axes are identified in k4 - 37 : one along pa @xmath1@xmath1740@xmath18 , defined by the main axis of the lobes and bright torus , and another one along pa @xmath1270@xmath18 ( or @xmath190@xmath18 ) , defined by the distortions of the bipolar lobes .",
    "besides , the point - symmetric features suggest additional particular directions in the nebula .    the central star of k4 - 37 has never been identified and is neither observed in our narrow - band images . central stars with @xmath19 or @xmath20 magnitudes @xmath5 17@xmath21 can be detected in ( narrow - band ) h@xmath7 or [ oiii ] images with moderate exposure times , which implies that the central star of k4 - 37 should be very faint . in an attempt to detect it",
    ", we obtained an image of k4 - 37 with cafos in 2016 may 3 using a johnson b filter and an exposure time of 1200s , under seeing conditions of @xmath11.5arcsec .",
    "no star can be recognized in our b image close to center of the object , where the central star could be expected , which would imply a lower limit of @xmath120@xmath21 for its @xmath20 magnitude . on the other hand , it is well known that central stars may be displaced from the nebular center ( e.g. , soker 1994 ; tweedy & napiwotzki 1994 ; soker , rappaport & harpaz 1998 ; chiotellis et al .",
    "we note that the images of k4 - 37 show a star at @xmath11.7arcsec from nebular center ( figures1 and 2 ) .",
    "its spectrum indicates a k - type star ( see section2.3 ) .",
    "a ( somewhat speculative ) alternative to the non detection of a star at the nebular center could be that the central star and the k - type star constitute a ( non - resolved ) binary system that has moved since the nebula was formed .",
    "if this was the case , the angular distance to the center and the age of the nebula ( @xmath110@xmath22yr , section3.2 ) would imply a proper motion of @xmath10.17masyr@xmath16 for the pair , corresponding to a tangential velocity of @xmath111kms@xmath16 ( at a distance of 14kpc , see section3.2 ) .",
    "if so , the large distorsion of the nebula towards the west , as compared with that towards the east , could be partially due to that motion . in any case",
    ", further efforts to detect the central star of k4 - 37 would be very valuable .      to complement our analysis ,",
    "we have retrieved the images of k4 - 37 obtained with the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) satellite in the four bands : w1 ( 3.4@xmath2 m ) , w2 ( 4.6@xmath2 m ) , w3 ( 12@xmath2 m ) , and w4 ( 22@xmath2 m ) , in a field of 15@xmath315arcmin@xmath4 centered on the object .",
    "k4 - 37 itself is not resolved in the wise images owing their relatively low spatial resolution ( 6.112arcsec ) and the small size of the object .",
    "in addition , the field star observed in the optical images ( fig.2 ) is bright at 3.422@xmath2 m and this star and the nebula are indistinguishable in the wise images .",
    "the more interesting result is observed in the w4 band a reproduction of which is shown in figure3 .",
    "k4 - 37 appears embedded in a complex nebular environment in which stands out an elliptical ring - like structure surrounding the optical pn .",
    "emission from the ring - like structure is also observed in the w3 band but more diffuse and fainter than in the w4 one , and is not observed in the w1 and w2 bands ( not shown here ) . the elliptical ring - like structure ( hereafter referred to as the 22@xmath2 m ring ) is open ( or very faint ) towards the northwest , contains a bright spot towards the southwest , and presents a complex region towards the northeast where it seems to contact an ambient filament .",
    "the edge of the 22@xmath2 m ring is relatively bright but emission is also detected inside it .",
    "the complex northern region makes it difficult to obtain accurately the orientation and major axis of this structure .",
    "nevertheless , its minor axis appears oriented close to pa @xmath1@xmath1760@xmath18 and is @xmath12arcmin in size , its major axis is @xmath12.93.6arcmin in size as measured at pa 30@xmath18 ( in the following we will adopt a major axis of 3.2arcmin ) , while a size of @xmath12.4arcmin is measured at pas 75@xmath18 and 165@xmath18 . from the image in fig.3 , an association , and not a superposition chance , between the 22@xmath2 m ring and the optical nebula is strongly suggested because the 22@xmath2 m ring , the only closed structure observed in the field , is well centered on k4 - 37 .",
    "nevertheless , the optical nebula seems to be slightly displaced towards the southeast with respect to the possible center of the 22@xmath2 m ring , which is difficult to define because of its complex northern region .",
    "the large difference in sizes between the optical nebula and the 22@xmath2 m ring strongly suggests that the latter should correspond to a much older ejection than that involved in the formation of the main nebula .",
    "as we will discuss below ( section3.3 ) , the 22@xmath2 m ring probably represents mass ejected from the agb progenitor of k4 - 37 .",
    "we note that the detection of this structure at 22@xmath2 m suggests dust as origin of its emission .",
    "intermediate - resolution , long slit - spectra of k4 - 37 were obtained on 2008 june 8 with the boller & chivens spectrograph mounted on the 2.1 m telescope at the san pedro martir observatory ( oan - spm ) , using the site3 ccd ( plate scale 24@xmath2 m  pix@xmath16 ) , with a 1k@xmath31k pixel array as a detector . we used a 400linesmm@xmath16 dispersion grating along with a 2.5arcsec slit width , giving a spectral resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath16.5 and covering the 43007400 spectral range .",
    "the slit was centered on the nebula and oriented at pa 90@xmath18 .",
    "four spectra were obtained with an exposure time of 1800s each .",
    "spectra reduction was carried out following standard procedures in xvista .",
    "in particular , the median of the four spectra was first derived and then it was subtracted from each individual spectrum to detect and eliminate cosmic rays manually .",
    "finally , the cleaned spectra were added to get a final spectrum with a total exposure time of 7200s .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were observed in the same night for flux calibration purposes .",
    "seeing was @xmath12.5arcsec during the observations .",
    "the field star overimposed on the nebula ( figs.1 and 2 ) is covered by the slit .",
    "the spectrum indicates a k - type for this star .",
    "we have fitted the continuum of this star and subtracted it from the integrated nebular spectrum .",
    "the contribution of the stellar absorption lines to the balmer nebular emission lines is difficult to evaluate because a more precise spectral type can not be deduced for the field star .",
    "nevertheless , from other observed absorption lines in the stellar spectrum , we estimate that this contribution should be lower than @xmath12% and , therefore , it is not critical in the analysis of the nebular emission spectrum",
    ".    figure4 shows the integrated spectrum of k4 - 37 and table1 lists the emission line intensities , their errors , and several parameters , as determined with the programm anneb , a description of which can be found in olgun et al .",
    "briefly , we used the extinction law of seaton ( 1979 ) and assume case b recombination to start an iterative process until the values of the logarithmic extinction coefficiente @xmath23(h@xmath24 ) , electron temperatures @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 $ ] and @xmath25@xmath26@xmath28 $ ] obtained from the [ nii ] and [ oiii ] emission line ratios , respectively , and electron density , @xmath29@xmath26@xmath30 $ ] obtained from the [ s ii]@xmath15@xmath156716,6731 emission lines , converge to their final values that are listed in table1 .",

    "the @xmath28$]/h@xmath24 line intensity ratio presents a moderate value of @xmath17.7 .",
    "noticeably , the @xmath33@xmath154686 emission line is also detected in our spectrum and indeed with a relatively strong intensity of about a third of h@xmath24 , suggesting a relatively hot central star .",
    "finally , the electron temperatures are quite typical of pne , while the electron density is very low ( see table1 ) , indicating a very evolved pne .",
    "ionic and elemental abundances were derived using the values of @xmath29@xmath26@xmath30 $ ] and @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 $ ] in table1 , and are listed in table2 .",
    "the icf method of kingsburgh & barlow ( 1984 ) has been used as implemented in anneb . the high he ( he / h @xmath10.145 ) and n ( n / h @xmath16.3@xmath310@xmath34 ) abundances make k4 - 37 a typical typei pn ( peimbert 1990 ) .",
    "sulfur and argon abundances are in the range of the values observed in pn and typei pne ( e.g. , kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) .",
    "what makes k4 - 37 particularly interesting is the high value of the n / o abundance ratio of @xmath12.32 that is among the highest ones observed in pne ( see , e.g. , pottasch , beintema & feibelman 2000 ; akras et al .",
    "2016 and references therein ) and indicates an extreme nitrogen enrichment .",
    "the high he and n abundances , and n / o abundance ratio imply an intermediate mass progenitor .",
    "we have compared the values in table2 with the models for stellar yields by karakas ( 2010 ) to estimate an initial mass of 46m@xmath0 for the main - sequence progenitor of k4 - 37 .",
    ".dereddened emission line intensities in k4 - 37 in units of @xmath35 = 100.0 [ cols=\"<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     our data analysis has shown that k4 - 37 should be classified as a multi - axis pne .",
    "in addition , a very large elliptical structure has been found at 22@xmath2 m surrounded the optical nebula , which probably corresponds to mass ejected in the agb phase of the progenitor of k4 - 37 .",
    "these findings provide information about the formation history of k4 - 37    according to the properties described in the previous sections , the 22@xmath2 m ring probably is a detached shell related to mass ejected during the agb phase .",
    "the emission detected inside the ring indicates that it is filled with material while the bright edge traces the site of interaction between the agb ejections and the ism ( e.g. , villaver , garca - segura & manchado 2002 ; schier , lindqvist & olofsson 2005 ; mattsson , hfner & herwig 2007 ) .",
    "detached shells are observed in many agb and post - agb stars ( e.g , speck , meixner & knapp 2000 ; cox et al . 2012 ; and references therein ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the 22@xmath2 m ring in k4 - 37 is the largest one of this kind of shells , only comparable to that around r crb ( size @xmath18.7pc , gillett et al .",
    "1997 ) , and much larger than those around agb stars ( sizes @xmath10.040.8pc , e.g. , olofsson et al .",
    "2000 ; cox et al . 2012 ) , and post - agb stars as , e.g. , afgl2688 and crl618 with sizes of @xmath14 and @xmath16.6pc , respectively ( speck et al .",
    "although the evolution of the these shells may be complex ( e.g. , villaver et al .",
    "2002 ) , detached shells around agb and post - agb stars could be expected to grow noticeably when the ( possible ) associated future pne reach a highly evolved phase .",
    "the elliptical morphology of the 22@xmath2 m ring contradicts the spherical mass ejection that is expected to dominate during the agb phase ( e.g. , olofsson et al .",
    "2000 ; kerschbaum et al .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about the origin of this morphology .",
    "deformation of an original spherical agb shell by the own interaction with the ism can be ruled out because of the very peculiar ism structure required to create a well defined elliptical ring .",
    "the 22@xmath2 m ring has some resemblance with the `` eye - type '' shells observed around some agb stars ( cox et al .",
    "`` eye - type '' shells have been modeled as deformation of an agb spherical shell by the ism magnetic field ( van marle , cox & decin 2015 ) and a similar model could be applicable to the 22@xmath2 m ring .",
    "alternatively , a companion could flatten the ( spherical ) envelope of an agb star ( mauron , huggins & cheung 2013 ) resulting in an oblated shell .",
    "molecular line observations of the 22@xmath2 m ring are required to study its kinematics , and to derive its 3d structure and properties .",
    "the formation of k4 - 37 itself fits well into the usual scenario in which several bipolar outflows have shaped the nebula ( sahai & trauger 1998 ) . as observed in many pne",
    ", the bipolar outflows should have been ejected at different directions and their collimation degree has also changed ; a poor collimated outflow seems to be involved in the formation of the bipolar lobes while more focused outflows could be related to the distortions of the lobes and point - symmetric regions .",
    "our data do not allow us to stablish a possible time sequence in the generation of the various outflows , although the bipolar lobes may be ascribed to a major ejection event .      among multi - axis pne , we found striking morphological similarities between k4 - 37 and ngc6309 , a pn with a bright equatorial torus and two pairs of bipolar lobes at different directions ( vzquez et al .",
    "2008 ; rubio et al .",
    "knotty and point - symmetric structures can be recognized in the lobes as well as distortions in one of the pairs of ngc6309 , characteristics that are present in k4 - 37 as well .",
    "interestingly , the two pairs of bipolar lobes and the torus of ngc6309 seem to be tilted with respect to the observer by the same amount ( vzquez et al .",
    "2008 ; rubio et al .",
    "this implies that if ngc6309 was observed from a line of sight perpendicular to the current one , it would appear as a `` simple '' bipolar pn , with a pair of bipolar lobes and an equatorial torus sharing a single main axis , and resembling the images of k4 - 37 ; in this case , only a morphokinematical analysis of ngc6309 would be able to reveal the existence of two pairs of lobes and different orientations of the structures .",
    "moreover , a spherical halo surrounds ngc6309 and evidence exists for a large shell with a size of @xmath11.5pc and kinematical age of @xmath11.5@xmath310@xmath36yr ( rubio et al .",
    "this comparison strongly suggests that the central stars of k4 - 37 and ngc6309 share a similar mass ejection history . in particular , the specific processes involved in the shaping of the multi - axis structure should have been very similar in both pne .",
    "some differences can be noticed between k4 - 37 and ngc6309 . in particular , the electron density in ngc6309 ( 1400 - 4000@xmath37 , vzquez et al .",

    "2015 ) that suggests a moderately young / evolved pn .",
    "probably k4 - 37 and ngc6309 are in a different evolutionary stage within pn evolution , being k4 - 37 in a more advanced one .",
    "however , the most interesting difference between k4 - 37 and ngc6309 is observed in their chemical abundances that are listed in table3 .",
    "although he seems to be slightly overabundant in ngc6309 , n may be deficient , and the n / o abundance ratio is very low . albeit multi - axis",
    ", ngc6309 is not a typei pn ( vzquez et al .",
    "chemical abundances in pne are primarily related to the initial mass of the progenitor . therefore , k4 - 37 and ngc6309 should have evolved from progenitors of very different mass .",
    "the chemical abundances in ngc6309 ( table3 ) and the models by karakas ( 2010 ) suggest an initial mass of @xmath111.2m@xmath0 for its progenitor , while 46m@xmath0 were estimated in the case of k4 - 37 ( see above ) .",
    "vzquez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) noticed that the existence of the multi - axis structure of ngc6309 strongly contrasts with the idea that these kind of pne should be associated with intermediate - mass progenitors ( e.g. , corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .",
    "the striking structural similarities between k4 - 37 and ngc6309 strengthen this conclusion : stars with very different initial mass have been able to shape very similar pne at the end of their lives .",
    "the complexity of k4 - 37 and ngc6309 is compatible with that expected from binary central stars and , in particular , from those having evolved through a common envelope phase .",
    "it is known that post - common envelope binary central stars tend to be associated with complex pne that often show multiple structures and/or signs of collimated / focused outflows ( miszalski et al .",

    "this shell is probably related to the mass ejected during the agb phase of the progenitor of k4 - 37 . *",

    "remarkable morphological similarites exist between k4 - 37 and ngc6309 .",
    "however , chemical abundances largely differ in both pne , indicating progenitors of very different initial mass .",
    "these results suggest that the initial mass of the progenitor has not played a crucial role in shaping these two pne but their formation can be better attributed to a similar mass loss history of their central stars that , given the complexity of both pne , are probably binary .",

    "<S> we present narrow- , broad - band , and wise archive images , and high- and intermediate - resolution long - slit spectra of k4 - 37 , a planetary nebula that has never been analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> although k4 - 37 appears bipolar , the morphokinematical analysis discloses the existence of three distinct axes and additional particular directions in the object , indicating that k4 - 37 is a multi - axis planetary nebula that has probably been shaped by several bipolar outflows at different directions . </S>",
    "<S> a 4 - 6m@xmath0 main - sequence progenitor is estimated from the derived high nebular he and n abundances , and very high n / o abundance ratio ( @xmath12.32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general properties are compatible with k4 - 37 being a highly evolved planetary nebula located at @xmath114kpc . the wise image at 22@xmath2 m reveals k4 - 37 to be surrounded by a large ( @xmath113@xmath38pc@xmath4 ) elliptical detached shell probably related to material ejected from the agb progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> the observed elliptical morphology suggests deformation of an originally spherical agb shell by the ism magnetic field or by the influence of a companion . </S>",
    "<S> we compare k4 - 37 and ngc6309 and found remarkable similarities in their physical structure but noticeably different chemical abundances that indicate very different progenitor mass . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that , irrespective of the initial mass , their ( presumably binary ) central stars have shared a very similar mass ejection history .    </S>",
