    "works exploring the quantum effects on multi - photon spatial interference and images have traditionally focused on experiments using a pair of photons @xcite .",

    "we demonstrate control over the quantum correlations of two biphotons that are encoded in a four qubit space by using a double slit .",
    "our setup is able to generate two pairs of highly entangled photons in one configuration and four nearly - separable photons in another .",
    "we further present a way of characterizing the state generated , without having to resort to fourfold coincidence detection , by exploiting the fact that each pair contains one photon of horizontal polarization and one of vertical polarization .",
    "this allows us to observe both the contribution that is common to single and double pair spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) events and the one that is exclusive to double pair events , i.e. coincidences between photons with the same polarization .",
    "finally , we also observed that the diffraction behavior depended on the quantum correlations of the photons , producing an asymmetrical pattern in the case of entangled photons and the expected diffraction pattern for the case of photons in a nearly - separable spatial state .    by encoding the transverse profile of photons on a discrete space with the use of slits",
    ", it becomes simple to scale the dimensionality , from qubits to qudits , by using more slits .",
    "this experiment , then , opens a path for future works using multi - pair qudit states .",
    "as it is customary , double - slits and multi - slits are characterized by their width @xmath1 and by the center - to - center distance @xmath2 .",
    "in order to exploit the possibility of scaling experiments to include quantum systems of dimensions greater than 2 , it has become usual to encode logical qubits and qudits on the transverse momentum and/or position state of photons .",
    "our experiment encodes the logical qubits @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the condition that the photon passes through the left or right slit , respectively .",
    "as presented for the two - photon case in @xcite , the most general state of a pair of qubits generated using a double slit and assuming a symmetrical illumination can be written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are maximally entangled states of two photons a and b known as bell states : @xmath8    up to now , experiments have been restricted to controlling the spatial state of a single bi - photon , by using linear optical elements . in this work",
    "we demonstrate experimental control of quantum correlations in a four - photon state comprised of two pairs of photons . by using a pulsed pump and a high - efficiency periodically - poled ktiop@xmath9 crystal @xcite , the second order term in @xmath10 on the expansion of the time - evolution operator associated to",
    "the spdc becomes relevant . in our experimental conditions",

    "the pump is a pulsed beam obtained by second harmonic generation on a bbo crystal pumped by an femtosecond pulsed laser that has pulses of 200 fs and a repetition rate of .",
    "the mean power of the pump beam when falling on the crystal is of the order of .",
    "it is loosely focused by a spherical lens onto a long , type - ii ppktp grown for collinear and degenerate spdc centered on @xmath11 .",
    "the created pair will consist of one horizontally ( h ) and one vertically ( v ) polarized photon .",
    "polarization was used as an auxiliary mode , in order to separate the photons of each pair into two distinct physical subsystems a and b , much in the same way non - collinear experiments that encode the qubits using polarization use the down - conversion linear momentum modes .",
    "the general state , considering one or two pairs cross the double - slit is , up to appropriate normalization @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the generation efficiency , depending on both the non - linear susceptibility and the pump intensity , and @xmath14 is a normalization constant .",
    "the four - photon component can then be written as @xmath15    since there is no genuine multipartite entanglement , it is sufficient to characterize the entanglement by the concurrence @xcite of the single pair , which is given by @xcite @xmath16    states with @xmath17 or @xmath18 are maximally entangled .",
    "conversely , states with @xmath19 and @xmath20 are separable .",
    "the presence of two photons of horizontal and vertical polarization also gives us the opportunity to consider the partial state of same - polarization photons .",
    "in practical terms , this is obtained by using a polarized beamsplitter to create two detection branches , one for horizontally and one for vertically polarized photons .",
    "since the two pairs are not entangled , the purity of the partial state , defined as @xmath21 and given below , will be used as a relevant indicator on those same - polarization coincidences , as it is directly related to the degree of entanglement in each pair : @xmath22 the combination of eq .",
    "( [ concurrence ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ purity ] ) allows us to write @xmath23",
    "in order to control the quantum correlations in the four photons , we will resort to a tunable linear optical scheme . here",
    "we present two extremal conditions , that is , the pairs of photons coming out of the double slit are either highly entangled or separable . the correlations after the double - slit depend on how the bi - photon field generated inside the crystal is projected onto the plane of the apertures .",
    "influence over the state encoded on the slits can be exerted either by controlling the pump field , the propagation of the bi - photons from the crystal to the slits or both .",
    "since the bi - photon field is not affected in one of the transverse dimensions by the double - slit ( the larger dimension , i.e. the @xmath24 direction ) , we restrict our analysis to the @xmath25 direction ( the smallest slit dimension ) .",
    "more specifically , the two - photon field in the crystal can be written , in the transverse momentum variables , as @xcite @xmath26where @xmath27 are the transverse components of the momentum of photon 1 and 2 in the bi - photon .",
    "the tilde indicates that the functions refer to the transverse momentum space .",
    "therefore @xmath28 is the angular spectrum of the pump beam and @xmath29 is the phase - matching condition for the ppktp .    in most cases , including our experiment , @xmath28 is the angular spectrum of a gaussian beam .",
    "hence , @xmath30 when the beam waist , @xmath31 , is in the center of the crystal , with @xmath32 corresponding to the fourier transform and @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the transverse position of photons 1 and 2 .",
    "if the last condition is not satisfied , phase components due to the curvature of the wavefront must be considered as well .    for our experimental conditions , the phase matching function is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a phase - mismatch term that we consider to be negligible , @xmath37 is the frequency of the degenerate down - converted photons and the effective refractive index @xmath38 takes into account the fact that the two photons in type - ii spdc propagate differently inside a crystal of length l. a more thorough description of the phase - matching function can be found in @xcite .",
    "+    figure [ setup ] shows the experimental setups used in this work to control the quantum correlations of the bi - photons at the double - slit plane .",
    "we adopted two configurations : to generate highly entangled states and to prepare separable states .",
    "scheme projects a magnified image of the crystal plane onto the double - slit .",
    "this geometry is achieved by adopting two lenses , a cylinder lens with focal lens @xmath39 and a spherical one with @xmath40 , so the magnification factor of the image reads @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt a cylinder lens in order to create a crystal image in the direction perpendicular to the slits , the x - direction , while keeping the far - field image in the y orthogonal direction . by such approach the dominant contribution to the bi - photon amplitude transmitted by the double - slit",
    "is the one associated to the phase - matching function .",
    "that is so because , in the magnified image of the crystal center projected on the slits , the gaussian profile of the pump component is much wider than the fourier transform of the @xmath42 function of the phase - matching condition and can be considered constant .",
    "configuration relies on the far - field imaging onto the double slit .",
    "this scheme is obtained by adopting a single spherical lens with focal length @xmath43 placed at a distance @xmath44 from both the center of the crystal and the plane of the slits . with this geometry",
    "the bi - photon amplitude is almost constant along the double - slit apertures leading to the generation of separable states .    a detailed discussion of the relation between the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) and the adopted geometries can be found in @xcite , in the form of what was called an engineering parameter @xmath47:@xmath48 that gives a clear method for estimating the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 by knowing the form of the two - photon amplitude function @xmath49 specifically when @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are coordinates on the plane of the double - slit and @xmath52 , as previously mentioned , is the distance from the center of one of the slits to the center of the slit pattern . in this case , the distance between the center of the slits is @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to the values calculated through that method when giving expected values for @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for our experimental setups ,",
    "the expected values are @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the configuration of fig . .",
    "by changing to the configuration of fig .",
    "we expect @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let us now discuss the measurements necessary to characterize the states generated by the setups presented in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 can be inferred by measurements on the image of the slits , which corresponds to the @xmath57 basis .",
    "measurements for determining @xmath46 , however , require us to go to the diagonal basis . for",
    "qubits encoded on transverse spatial variables , this can be achieved by looking at coincidence measurements on the pattern generated in the far field of the slits , that gives information on both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "one way to access the far field is to use a lens with focal length @xmath58 in the @xmath44-@xmath44 configuration .",
    "this maps the fourier transform of the slits onto positions on the detection plane , as shown in eq .",
    "5 - 19 of @xcite .",
    "the probability of coincident detection of two photons from the same pair , one of horizontal polarization and the other of vertical polarization , when using the far - field strategy , can be derived as a function of the position of both detectors involved , @xmath59 . to calculate it",
    ", we first assume the contribution of only a single pair of photons and then follow mandel and wolf @xcite to obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 is calculated by propagating the electrical field operators from the plane of the slits to the detection plane , taking into account the lens placed at a distance @xmath58 from both planes .",
    "this , as mentioned before , means taking the optical fourier transform of the product of the aperture function and the amplitude of the bi - photon on the plane of the slits @xcite .    after performing the calculations",
    ", we obtain the explicit form of @xmath64 : @xmath65 + \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sin ^2(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta(x_1+x_2)).\\label{pdbc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this function can be represented on a plane , which we will call the coincidence map .",
    "the same approach can be adopted to represent the coincidence counts detected in the experiment , allowing us to compare experimental and theoretical maps .",
    "we see that it depends of both @xmath45 and @xmath46 , meaning the coincidence maps can be used to characterize both parameters of the state .",
    "the following step is to characterize the measurements sensitive exclusively to the two - pair contribution @xmath66 .",
    "since we work with two pairs of photons , the most natural type of measurement would be fourfold coincidence detection .",
    "this , however , is impractical due to the fact that only a small fraction of the total signal is collected by the detectors when in the far - field regime .",
    "as fourfold coincidences depend on the overall efficiency of four detectors , it can require extremely long detection times .",
    "to circumvent this predicament , we use the fact that our source of photon pairs is a type - ii crystal and , thus , coincidences on the same polarization branch can only come from down - conversion events in which two pairs were created .",
    "another factor that favors same - branch coincidences as a method for investigating the two - pair signature is that only one beamsplitter ( bs ) is involved , whereas two are necessary on fourfold detection events , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ detection ] .    these coincidences can be mapped in much the same way as those from two photons with orthogonal polarization .",
    "even though double - pair events are not the major contribution , the probability of detecting h - h or v - v coincidences is still much larger than of detecting fourfold coincidences , since only two detectors are involved in the process and , therefore , only two detection efficiencies are taken into account .",
    "the expression for coincidence detection of photons on the same polarization branch is : @xmath67    to calculate it , we use @xmath68 in which @xmath69 can be either @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "indexes @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to the two pairs of photons .",
    "the density matrix @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 being the partial trace over the photon of polarization @xmath77 .",
    "note that the same derivation can be used to calculate the probability of detecting coincidences between photons of different polarization and different pairs .",
    "equations ( [ pdbc ] ) and ( [ psbc ] ) have been derived under the assumption that the incident two - photon field can be considered constant over the width of a single slit , which is taken to be very narrow .",
    "this allowed us to factor out the diffraction term as an enveloping function that is radially symmetric around the origin in the plane formed by @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as we will discuss in section [ diffraction ] , this is not true for all situations , but is a valid approximation if one is interested only in studying , for instance , the interference behavior close to the center of the detection plane .",
    "we will now discuss in detail the experimental procedure used to obtain the coincidence maps .",
    "the detection setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ detection ] is composed of a spherical lens fl of focus length @xmath78 and four avalanche photo - diodes ( apd ) detectors divided into two polarization branches , as indicated above by the dashed bounding boxes .",
    "each branch corresponds to one of the outputs of a polarized beamsplitter ( pbs ) and contains a balanced beamsplitter ( bs1 and bs2 ) .",
    "thus , coincidences can be detected between apds on the same polarization branch , to which we refer as * sbc * ( * * s**ame * * b**ranch * * c**oincidences ) , and on different branches , referred to as * dbc * ( * * d**ifferent * * b**ranch * * c**oincidences ) .",
    "each detector is mounted on a manual translation stage in the x direction , defined as being parallel to the optical table plane and orthogonal to the propagation direction of the beam .",
    "additionally , a pinhole and an interference filter ( @xmath79 ) centered on are placed in front of the apd .",
    "coincidences are detected in a 1 ns window using a custom electronic circuit .",
    "such a time frame is large enough to collect all events originated from a single pulse but small enough so that there can be no coincidence between photons from two different pulses , allowing us to consider each pulse as an isolated spdc event that may generate either zero , one or two pairs of photons .",
    "the maps are the result of 21 scans ( 17 in the case of fig .",
    "[ entangled_diffraction ] ) where two detectors , one in each branch remain in a fixed position and the other two are moved in steps of ( for fine scans over the main interference region ) or for broad scans , meant for observing the diffraction pattern over a larger area .",
    "in addition to generating the maps , the data collected was also used to evaluate efficiency of our source . to calculate the contribution of single and double pair events , we have estimated the detection efficiency of our apparatus starting from the measured count and coincidence rates of detectors .",
    "considering uncorrelated spatial photon pairs generated with an average pair number per pulse @xmath47 , detected with an overall efficiency @xmath80 , for an experiment with time duration @xmath81 and repetition rate @xmath82 , the average counts of the detector are equal to @xmath83 , while the measured coincidences are @xmath84 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 can then be obtained as @xmath85 .",
    "spatial correlations between the two photons can modify the previous relation , so the data used corresponds to the maxima of detection on each map .",
    "following the experimental procedures detailed in the previous section , we obtain coincidence maps on the far field of the double slits , which will serve as fingerprints for identifying the states generated .",
    "the parameters obtained from these maps were then compared to those predicted by the theoretical model of our experiment , as presented in section [ control ] .",
    "maps on fig .",
    "[ correlated ] , [ uncorrelated ] and [ diffraction_separable ] were generated from a matrix of 21x21 experimental points .",
    "those on fig .",
    "[ entangled_diffraction ] originate from a 17x17 grid , although the separation between points are the same as that of fig .",

    "additionally , the latter are generated over the same grids of points , corresponding to the same values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this means that artifacts due to interpolation are not exclusive to the experimental maps and should present themselves in the same manner on the simulations , minimizing discrepancies that may influence the interpretation of the processed data .",
    "there are , however , some artifacts present only on experimental maps , due to noise on the data set . on the case of maps on fig .",

    "equation ( [ pdbc ] ) was used to simulate the different branch coincidence map for comparing with the experimental dbc map .",
    "since this equation does nt take in account coincidences between photons of orthogonal polarization but from different pairs , we have subtracted that contribution from @xmath86 by estimating the accidental coincidences as @xmath87 .",
    "these accidental coincidences , calculated for each measured point , were also subtracted from the maps .    using the corrected data",

    "this was expected , since the photons have almost no entanglement and , therefore , should behave as four independent photons diffracting through the slit aperture .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ diffraction_separable ] that the envelopes for both sbc and dbc are very similar , with minor differences attributed in part to a small degree of entanglement present and also to image rendering artifacts .",
    "in this work we demonstrated experimental control of quantum correlations in a four - photon path state comprised of two pairs of photons . our scheme adopted a high - efficiency type - ii parametric down - conversion source coupled to a double slit by a variable linear optical setup , in order to obtain spatially encoded qubits . by altering experimental parameters ,",
    "we have generated pairs with very high and very low degree of entanglement , and shown that the quantum correlations influence the two - photon interference pattern .",
    "that makes it possible to use a map of coincidence measurements for characterizing the four - photon path state .",
    "moreover , we have shown that , in the case of type - ii multi - pair generation , maps for coincidences between photons with the same polarization , as well as between photons with orthogonal polarization , can be used to obtain a full understanding of the phenomenon without having to resort to fourfold coincidence detection .",
    "finally , we observed that the diffraction pattern is also affected by the degree of transverse quantum correlation between the two photons of a pair at the double - slit plane .",
    "we were able to present a semi - quantitative approach that resulted in simulated maps in good agreement to the experimental results . a more detailed study aiming for a closed theoretical description of how entanglement plays a part in distorting the diffraction patterns observed on coincidence measurements is under way .    currently , the main impediment for more efficient multi - pair experiments in quantum imaging is the fact that the area integrated by the detector is very small .",
    "the fast improvement on the field of ccd detectors , both in readout time and in sensitivity , opens the possibility for an experiment with four or more multi - pixel detectors with largely increased genuine multi - pair detection signal @xcite .",
    "another direction of improvement is the expansion of the dimension of the logical basis from qubits to qudits .",
    "this can be implemented by increasing the number of slits and adjusting the quantum correlation control setup in an appropriate way . with a larger space ,",
    "many interesting options become available , such as non - locality @xcite and contextuality @xcite tests .",
