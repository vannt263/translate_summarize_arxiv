    "an extended  observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy  in 2009 found a rich absorption line spectrum indicating a photoionised outflow with a wide range of velocities and ionisation parameter ( pounds  2011 ; hereafter paper i ) . the absorption line velocity structure and a broad correlation of velocity with ionisation parameter",
    "were shown to be consistent with an outflow scenario where a highly ionised , high velocity wind , perhaps launched during intermittent super - eddington accretion ( king and pounds 2003 ) , runs into the interstellar medium or previous ejecta , losing much of its kinetic energy in the resultant strong shock .",
    "the wider importance of such shocked outflows lies in the possibility that the accumulated thrust from multiple episodes - rather than the outflow energy - would eventually drive gas from the bulge , thereby limiting further star formation and black hole growth .",
    "such a momentum - driven feedback mechanism has been shown by king ( 2003 , 2005 ) to reproduce the observed correlation of black hole and bulge mass ( e.g. ferrarese and merritt 2000 , gebhardt  2000 , haring and rix 2004 ) ) .",
    "growing evidence for extreme velocity ( v@xmath00.1 - 0.2c ) x - ray outflows ( chartas  2002 , pounds   2003 , 2006 ; reeves  2003 , cappi 2006 , tombesi  2010 ) has been confined to the very highly ionised matter ( log@xmath2@xmath03.54 ) most readily detected in the fe k band .",
    "if the tombesi findings are confirmed , with highly ionised outflows at v@xmath00.1c being relatively common in bright nearby galaxies , then perhaps eddington or mildly super - eddington accretion is also more common than generally believed .",
    "( a case for agn black hole masses being over - estimated has recently been argued by king ( 2010a ) ) .",
    "we note that if the ejection of fast outflows is intermittent , as suggested in paper i for , then only where such a wind is current or was launched very recently will it retain a line - of - sight column close to the value n@xmath3@xmath0@xmath4 @xmath5 , appropriate to continuum driving ( king and pounds 2003 ) and probably required for detection of a v@xmath00.1c flow in a very low redshift agn with current x - ray missions .    the primary aim of the present paper is to examine the complex fe k emission and absorption profile of  and attempt to resolve and identify dicrete spectral features carrying information on the highly ionised outflow and re - processing of the primary x - ray continuum .",
    "we have sought to confirm the presence of the highly ionised pre - shock wind discussed in paper i , for which scaling from the strong absorption seen at velocities up to @xmath09000 km",
    "s@xmath1 predicts a wind velocity in the range @xmath00.110.13c .",
    "we also examine the fe k absorption line structure at different continuum flux levels to establish whether the highly ionised outflow component varies on a similar few - day timescale to that observed in rgs spectra for lower ionisation gas over the same velocity regime ( pounds and vaughan 2011a ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "was observed by  on 15 orbits between 2009 may 3 and june 15 .",
    "here we use primarily data from the epic pn camera ( strder 2001 ) , which has the best sensitivity of any current instrument in the fe k band ( @xmath06 - 10 kev ) . excluding high background data near the end of each orbit the total exposure available for spectral fitting is @xmath0600 ks .",
    "further details on the timing , flux levels and x - ray light curves for each orbital revolution are included in vaughan  ( 2011 ) .",
    "line energies are quoted throughout the paper adjusted for the redshift of , with the calculation of line shifts and velocities also taking account of a pn detector energy offset ( see below ) by cross - reference to the simultaneous data from the mos camera ( turner 2001 ) .",
    "line widths are the intrinsic values , after allowance for pn camera energy resolution . unless specified otherwise , uncertainties correspond to 90 @xmath6 confidence limits .",
    "figure 1 ( top panel ) shows epic pn spectral data summed over the whole 2009  observation , plotted as a ratio to the continuum determined by first fitting the data between 5 and 10 kev with a power law plus gaussian emission line at @xmath06.4 kev , and then removing the line .",
    "the aim of that simple procedure was to delineate any emission and absorption fine structure without introducing potential artefacts from modelling the characteristic curvature in the continuum with reflection or ionised absorption .",
    "the ratio plot of pn data to this simple power law continuum shows a narrow fe k emission line with an apparent red wing , together with several absorption lines to higher energy .",
    "gaussian fitting to the individual spectral features finds the fe k emission can be modelled with a narrow and a broad component .",
    "the narrow line energy ( adjusted for the redshift of ) is 6.437@xmath70.006 kev ( 0.004 kev , consistent with fluorescence from stationary and cold matter .",
    "the mos energy calibration is believed to be more stable than that of the pn and all absorption line blue - shifts used here to calculate outflow velocities are adjusted by a corresponding factor of 0.996 ] ) .",
    "the broad component is centred at 6.4@xmath70.1 kev with width @xmath8=650@xmath770 ev .",
    "three absorption lines , at @xmath06.8 , @xmath07.15 and @xmath08.0 kev and a possible fourth line at @xmath07.75 kev were then modelled with negative gaussians .",
    "lines labelled 1,3 and 4 in figure 1 were found to be narrow and were therefore fixed at a width corresponding to the pn resolution ( @xmath8@xmath060 ev ) .",
    "component 2 is clearly resolved , and the gaussian fit yielded an intrinsic 1@xmath8 width of 113@xmath717 ev .",
    "measured line energies ( adjusted to the rest frame of ) are listed in table 1 where alternative identifications are used to infer relevant outflow velocities .",
    "component 1 is rather unambiguously identified with the resonance line of he - like fe xxv ( although a more blue - shifted inner shell uta is theoretically possible , kallman  2004 ) .",
    "the fe xxv identification yields a projected outflow velocity of @xmath05500 km s@xmath1 , similar to the strong absorption seen in o viii and higher level ions in the rgs data , and identified with the early post - shock flow in paper i.    component 2 has two candidate identifications , the more likely being with h - like fe xxvi , corresponding to an outflow velocity of @xmath07200 km s@xmath1 for the measured centroid energy .",
    "however , as the line profile is broadened ( as it also was in the  observation of 2001 ( pounds  2004 ) ) , an alternative fit to component 2 is a velocity range @xmath050009000 km s@xmath1 for fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , a similar broad absorption / velocity trough is seen in o viii lyman-@xmath9 in the highest flux rgs spectrum ( paper i ) .",
    "the third strongest absorption line in figure 3 is component 4 , at @xmath08 kev .",
    "the most interesting identification , in the context of the present study , is with fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 , yielding an outflow velocity of 38300@xmath71250 km s@xmath1 , within the range predicted in paper i for the pre - shock wind .",
    "however , lower velocity absorption from the fexxv 1s-3p transition must be present at some level , though the relative line strength and low velocity , compared with the 1s-2p line at @xmath06.8 kev , suggest this may not be the dominant absorption component .",
    "of the remaining candidates listed in table 1 , the fe xxv 1s-2p line appears least likely , implying an extreme velocity , well outside the predicted range for the putative pre - shock wind , while significant absorption from he - like ni would imply a substantial over - abundance of ni relative to fe .    finally , if confirmed , component 3 would provide some independent support for the detection of the pre - shock wind , the most likely identification with the fe xxv resonance line then forming a high velocity pairing with that of fe lyman-@xmath9 for component 4 .",
    "the ratio plot of figure 1 also shows a positive feature at @xmath09.4 kev lying close to the ionisation threshold energy of fe xxvi .",
    "an intriguing identification , given the strong radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) seen in the rgs spectrum ( paper ii ) , would be with the rrc of fe xxvi , with a blue - shifted velocity of @xmath05300@xmath72000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , we see in the next section that the reality of this emission feature is dependent on correctly modelling the underlying continuum near 9 kev .    in summary , a simple examination of pn spectral data",
    "summed over the @xmath0600 ks observation of  finds evidence for several blue - shifted absorption lines in the fe k band , together with both narrow and broad emission components .",
    "the implied outflow velocities from absorption lines 1 and 2 , and the indication of line broadening in the feature at @xmath07.1 kev , maps closely to the velocity profile observed in oviii lyman-@xmath9 and similar lower mass ions ( paper i ) , suggesting we are seeing in fe k a co - moving , more highly ionised ( lower density ) component of the same post - shock flow . of particular interest in the context of the shocked wind interpretation of the complex rgs absorption spectrum ( paper i , paper ii ) is the possible identification of absorption line 4 with fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 , corresponding to a velocity component with the predicted ( factor @xmath04 ) higher value for the putative pre - shock wind .",
    "we note , however , that outcome must be qualified by a likely blend with the 1s-3p transition in fe xxv .",
    ".summary of gaussian line fits to the four most significant absorption lines in figure 1 , adjusted to the  rest frame , and with the corresponding outflow velocity also allowing for the known pn calibration error [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the broad band spectral fitting in the previous section modelled the fe k emission with a narrow gaussian component and a relativistic _ diskline _",
    "( fabian  1989 )",
    ". the narrow component ( when adjusted for the pn calibration shift ) lies close to 6.4 kev , with an equivalent width ( ew ) against the direct continuum of @xmath0110 ev , consistent with fluorescence from the weakly ionised reflector in the continuum fit ( matt 2002 ) .",
    "finding parameters of the narrow emission line in the summed data consistent with those for the low flux orbit , rev 1739 , is strong support for our initial assumption that the cold reflection component was essentially unchanged during the 2009 campaign .",
    "however , the line appears resolved , with an intrinsic width 1@xmath8=70@xmath710 ev . if due only to velocity broadening , that width corresponds to @xmath07500@xmath71100 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) , intriguingly close to the dominant velocity in the post - shock outflow .",
    "relativistic fluorescence emission from the inner accretion disc is a reasonable candidate for the red wing of the fe line , given that the rapid flux variability in the x - ray emission from  ( vaughan  2011 ) indicates a primary continuum source dimension of a few 10r@xmath10 .",
    "the 3 - 10 kev spectral fit described in the previous section includes a _ diskline _ with a input line energy of 6.8@xmath70.2 kev , emissivity index @xmath11=-4.5@xmath70.7 , r@xmath12=6@xmath71 and inclination of 23@xmath73 @xmath13 .",
    "the line is relatively weak , with ew @xmath0130 ev .",
    "although the narrow emission line appears quasi - constant throughout the 2009 observation , we can not assume that is also true for the _ diskline _ component .",
    "that issue is raised in the following section when we explore the variability of the fe k profile and find evidence for pcygni emission associated with the stronger absorption lines .",
    "if confirmed , that would confirm a substantial covering factor in the ionised flow ( as was found previously for the high velocity outflow in the luminous seyfert pg1211 + 143 ; pounds and reeves , 2009 ) .",
    "the fe k absorption line spectrum in the summed 2009 data is more complex than the single @xmath07.1 kev absorption line reported from the 2001 observation ( pounds  2004 ) . in particular ,",
    "a second strong absorption line at @xmath06.8 kev supports the 2001 line identification with fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 , for a velocity of @xmath06500 km s@xmath1 ( in preference to fe xxv 1s-2p and a velocity of @xmath017500 km s@xmath1 ) , with a similar outflow velocity but somewhat lower ionisation parameter in the summed data from 2009 .",
    "a coordinated  and  study 6 months before our 2009  campaign also found absorption lines at @xmath06.8 and @xmath07.1 kev ( lobban  2010 ) , perhaps suggesting little change in the highly ionised @xmath06500 km s@xmath1 outflow component over that timescale .    however , our analysis of the rgs data from the 2009  observation ( paper i , paper ii ) found evidence for a change in the ionisation state of more moderately ionised gas on a timescale of a few days .",
    "as the two strongest absorption lines in the fe k region indicate a comparable ( @xmath05000 - 7000 km s@xmath1 ) velocity regime , it is interesting to check for a similarly rapid response to changes in the incident continuum flux level .",
    "more particularly , if the fe xxv and xxvi absorption arises in a co - moving , lower density ( and more highly ionised ) flow component , we might anticipate measurable variability over the 6-weeks duration of the 2009 observation .    to search for short - term variability in the fe k profile",
    "we have used the summed 2009 data fit described in section 3 as a template against which to compare spectral fits for individual orbits .",
    "the cold reflection and narrow fe k emission line parameters were fixed in this comparison , but the power law index and normalisations , _ diskline _ normalisation and ionisation parameter of the partial cover were left free .",
    "the energy and width of the individual absorption lines were fixed at the summed data values , implying no short - term change in the velocity structure of the outflow .",
    "fitting was carried out for individual orbit data over 3 - 10 kev .",
    "figure 5 plots the equivalent width ( ew ) of the 4 absorption lines of figure 4 and table 2 , together with the 0.3 - 3 and 7 - 10 kev luminosities , for successive orbits rev1721 ( 1 ) to rev 1743 ( 15 ) , with the summed spectral fit as ( 16 ) .",
    "the single orbit parameters were then compared to the best fitting constant value , using a @xmath14 test in order to quantify evidence for their variability . in three cases ( @xmath06.8 , @xmath07.1 and @xmath08.0 kev ) the ews",
    "were found to be variable at greater than 99@xmath6 confidence .",
    "visual examination of figure 5 suggests the individual absorption line ews vary in a non - random manner .",
    "in particular , the @xmath06.8 and @xmath08.0 kev absorption depths both appear to increase over the first 4 orbits , and follow a visually similar pattern over the remaining orbits .",
    "since the strong @xmath07.1 kev absorption line does not follow the same pattern , the implication is of a change in ionisation state , rather than column density , in the corresponding velocity component of the ( post shock ) outflow .    to test those impressions we searched for correlations between the absorption line ews and continuum luminosities , using the standard pearson ( linear ) correlation coefficient .",
    "the four absorption lines were compared to each other and to the 7 - 10 kev and 0.3 - 3 kev luminosities . the only strongly significant correlation ( at @xmath1599@xmath6 confidence )",
    "was found between the ews of the @xmath06.8 and @xmath08.0 kev absorption lines . over the whole data set the @xmath06.8 and @xmath07.1 kev lines",
    "were not significantly correlated , while none of the lines showed a significant correlation to the continuum flux . however ,",
    "visual inspection of figure 5 does suggest a link of ews with extreme continum values on an orbit - to - orbit timescale , and similar trends over several adjacent orbits .",
    "while these findings are not simply understood , the lack of a strong correlation with continua levels overall may indicate a delayed response to the ionising flux for both the high and lower velocity ( putative pre- and post - shock ) flow components , or - as indicated below - a competition between hard ionising radiation and soft compton cooling flux .",
    "the inter - line correlations are not decisive on the identification of the @xmath08 kev aborption .",
    "while the @xmath06.8 and @xmath08.0 kev absorption depth correlation is expected if both lines are from fexxv , the similar ews would require the 1s-2p resonance absorption to be strongly saturated , inconsistent with its marked variability .",
    "in addition , a positive correlation with the most likely alternative candidate for line 4 , namely a high velocity component in fe lyman-@xmath9 , could also arise if the mean ionisation states of the post - shock and pre - shock flow components lie , respectively , between fe xxv/ fe xxvi and fe xxvi / xxvii .",
    "comparison with a photoionisation grid shows that situation implies a difference in ionisation parameter for the two flow components in the range @xmath068 ( kallman  2004 ) , qualitatively consistent with the factor 4 increase in density of the flow across a strong shock , followed by a further increase as the post - shock flow slows to @xmath05500 km s@xmath1 ( paper i ) .",
    "the continuum driving model for high velocity agn winds ( king and pounds 2003 ) would predict such an extreme launch ionisation parameter .",
    "we review below some individual - orbit spectra with the aim of clarifying the apparent variations in ionisation state of the absorbing outflow , and find additional orbital timescale changes in emission .",
    "figure 6 shows the best - fit fe k profiles for the first 8 orbits ( rev 1721 to rev 1730 ) of the 2009  campaign .",
    "orbit - to - orbit differences are seen in both absorption and emission structure .",
    "at top left the mean profile for the summed 2009 pn data is reproduced , noting - in particular - similarly strong absorption lines at @xmath06.8 and @xmath07.1 kev .",
    "in contrast , the sum of the first two orbits , revs 1721 and 1722 ( similar individual orbit profiles have been added in figure 6 for improved definition ) shows the 7.1 kev line to be dominant .",
    "however , by the next observation , rev 1724 , the situation has reversed with the 6.8 kev line now the stronger . identifying this line pair , as before , with resonance absorption in fe xxv and fe xxvi , respectively , indicates the ionisation state of the relevant outflow component , at v@xmath05000 - 7000 km s@xmath1 , has fallen over that 4 day interval .",
    "figure 5 shows the 7 - 10 kev luminosity _ rising _ over those early orbits , which rules out a simple link with the ionising continuum @xmath157 kev , unless there is a substantial recombination time delay in the relevant outflow component after some ( unseen ) high flux level prior to the first   observation .",
    "however , figure 5 does show those first 3 orbits to be on a stronger rising trend in soft x - ray flux , the 0.3 - 3 kev flux doubling from rev 1721 to rev 1724 , offering an alternative explanation of the change in ionisation state which is qualitatively consistent with dominant compton cooling of the post - shock gas , as proposed in paper i. the broad range of ionisation parameter over which the he - like ion stage is dominant might then explain the similar absorption profile being maintained as the overall continuum flux falls in rev 1725 .",
    "the compton cooling interpretation is supported by the following ( rev 1727 ) profile , where the 6.8 kev absorption line remains dominant , and where figure 5 shows the soft x - ray luminosity to be still higher .",
    "the rev 1727 profile also shows a strong emission shoulder to the high energy side of the narrow fe k line .",
    "we return to considering that emission feature in section 5.2 .",
    "the 6th panel in figure 6 , for revs 1728 and 1729 ( again similar individual orbit profiles have been added ) shows the ionisation state to have recovered to that of the summed data , while the 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity has fallen by over a third from the high rev 1727 value , with the ionising continuum ( 7 - 10 kev ) luminosity remaining little changed .",
    "the new trend of increasing ionisation parameter is extended in rev 1730 , with the 7.1 kev line now dominant .",
    "although the soft x - ray luminosity has again increased in rev 1730 , figure 5 shows this is the only orbit for which the 7 - 10 kev luminosity is significantly above the mean value .",
    "we suggest later that the factor @xmath02 increase in ionising flux in rev 1730 , the highest of the campaign , is the probable cause of this highly ionised state .",
    "the final panel in figure 6 shows the fe k profile for rev 1736 , where the x - ray continuum has again fallen to a low value , very similar to that of rev 1725 .",
    "the absorption spectrum is also very similar to rev 1725 , with a dominant line at @xmath06.8 kev indicating the ionisation state of the @xmath06500 km s@xmath1 flow component is again below the 2009 mean .",
    "the fe k profile for rev 1727 , coincident with an unusually strong soft x - ray flux , is particularly striking , and notably different from that for the summed 2009 data .",
    "while only the @xmath06.8 kev is absorption line can be seen , p cygni emission is clearly visible on the low energy shoulder of that line .",
    "( ) adding positive and negative gaussians to model the p cygni structure ( figure 7 ) yields a significantly improved fit , with @xmath16@xmath14 of 21 for 5 fewer d.o.f .",
    "the absorption line at 6.81@xmath70.02 kev is unresolved ( and then fixed at the pn resolution ) while the emission component has a 1@xmath8 width of 115@xmath738 ev and energy 6.71@xmath70.05 kev .",
    "the two components are of similar ew , indicating a substantial covering factor , with an inflection point at 6.76@xmath70.04 kev , consistent with the rest energy of the fe xxv 1s-2p resonance transition in the rest frame of .",
    "although not well constrained , the emission line width is also compatible with a wide angle outflow for the @xmath06000 km s@xmath1 velocity component , associated in our model with the post - shock gas .",
    "we note the potential of higher quality data of such features in mapping the geometry of the corresondingly flow components .    to the low energy side of the fe line in the rev 1727 data",
    "both positive and negative spectral features can be seen , each of which is marginally significant , with @xmath16@xmath14 of 6 to 8 .",
    "those at @xmath05.1 and @xmath05.5 kev might be related to to the emission line reported by turner  ( 2010 ) ; see also section 6 .",
    "similarly , absorption lines indicated at @xmath05.35 and @xmath05.75 kev could correspond to the anticipated in - fall of cool , shocked gas with velocities of order 0.2c and 0.11c , respectively .",
    "however , unlike the absorption line at @xmath06.8 kev , these lower energy features in the rev 1727 profile do not appear in the spectrum summed over the whole 2009 observation , suggesting they are short lived features or outlying statistical fluctuations .",

    "the epic spectrum from 2001 ( rev 0263 ) showed a single absorption line at @xmath07.1 kev in both pn and mos data , with alternative identifications of fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 and fe xxv 1s-2p resonance transitions indicating a corresponding outflow velocity of @xmath06500 or @xmath016500 km s@xmath1 . a comparison with the 2009 summed data template , with only the direct power law and absorption line depths free ( a prior check showing the narrow fe k emission line flux , hence cold reflection , to be only marginally higher ) , yielded an excellent 3 - 10 kev fit ( @xmath14 = 582/610 ) .",

    "the rev 0541 fit is further improved with the addition of a narrow emission line at 5.54@xmath70.02 kev ( @xmath16@xmath14 of 10/2 ) and an unresolved absorption line at 8.10@xmath70.1 kev ( @xmath16@xmath14 of 8/2 ) .",
    "the former feature lies close to that reported at 5.44@xmath70.03 kev in  data and attributed to spallation of fe into cr ( turner and miller 2010 ) .",
    "the high energy absorption line was picked out in the survey for high velocity flows in agn spectra from the  archive search by tombesi  ( 2010 ) , and identified there with fe lyman-@xmath9 for a blue - shifted velocity of @xmath00.13@xmath70.01c .    in the context of alternative identifications of the @xmath08 kev absorption line in the present paper ,",
    "it is interesting to note that no absorption line at @xmath06.8 kev is apparent in the rev 0541 spectrum , while being consistent with the putative high speed wind being very highly ionised , becoming more visible in the fe xxvi lyman-@xmath9 line at low ionising fluxes .    in summary ,",
    "a re - examination of the 2001 data strengthens the earlier interpretation of the line observed at @xmath07.1 kev as arising from fe xxvi resonance absorption from matter outflowing at @xmath06500 km s@xmath1 . in the context of our analysis of the more comprehensive absorption data from the 2009  spectra ,",
    "that finding suggests the post shock flow is persistent , with an ionisation state changing from dominantly fe xxv to dominantly fe xxvi as the ionising flux increases to the levels seen in rev 0263 ( and rev 1730 ) .",
    "the similarity of the narrow fek emission line flux and ( resolved ) line width in the 2001 , 2002 and 2009  observations suggests the longer - term persistence of the weakly ionised matter responsible for the fe k line fluorescence and associated continuum reflection .",
    "if that matter is linked to the post shock flow in , as suggested here , the important implication is that the high speed wind is also a persistent feature .",
    "the 600 ks observation of  in 2009 has provided some of the richest x - ray spectra to date for studying the outflow properties in an agn .",
    "in addition to the increased sensitivity afforded by the unusually long observation , comparison with previous observations from ,  and  ( collinge 2001 , pounds  2004 , steenbrugge  2009 , lobban 2011 ) suggests that our 2009 campaign benefited from an overall timescale compatible with intrinsic variability in the flow parameters .",
    "in paper i we identified 3 broad velocity regimes in the outflow in line - of - sight to , referred to there as the low ( @xmath171000 km s@xmath1 ) , intermediate ( @xmath03000 - 9000 km s@xmath1 ) and high velocity ( @xmath00.1c ) flows , with the low and intermediate velocities well populated by absorption lines from a wide range of metal ions from c to fe .",
    "the highest velocity component was only detected - at relatively low confidence - in fe k absorption .",
    "paper i then explored the possibility that the three velocity regimes represent different stages in a shocked high speed wind ( king 2010 ) , where the intermediate velocity / intermediate ionisation outflow corresponds to the immediate post - shock gas and the low velocity / low ionisation absorption to matter building up ahead of the contact discontinuity . in a second paper ( paper ii ) , we proposed that a low velocity absorption component observed in rgs spectra near the line cores of several broad resonance emission line components had a separate origin as self - absorption in the limb - brightened shell of shocked gas .    in the king ( 2010 ) model",
    "a high velocity ionised wind collides with the ism of the host galaxy , resulting in a strong shock .",
    "the gas density increases by a factor @xmath04 at the shock front , and the velocity drops by the same factor . beyond this ( reverse , adiabatic ) shock , the flow is further compressed in a relatively thin , cooling region , while the velocity slows to low values at the interface with the ism .",
    "strong compton cooling by the agn soft x - ray / uv radiation leads to a fairly rapid transition between the immediate post - shock regime and the much slower and compressed state near the contact discontinuity .",
    "the primary aim of the present paper has been to examine the complex fe k emission and absorption profile and attempt to resolve and identify spectral features carrying information on the highly ionised outflow and re - processing of the primary x - ray continuum .",
    "we have employed two methods of analysis , first with gaussian fitting of the ratio for the summed pn data profile to a simple power law baseline , and then by a more physical modelling in _ xspec _ where the continuum is fitted with a weakly ionised reflection component ( consistent in strength and ionisation state with the observed narrow fe k fluorescence line ) , and a partially covered direct power law .",
    "we find the absorption line structure from the two methods to be in good agreement .",
    "detection of 3 ( or 4 ) blue - shifted absorption lines provides evidence for two velocity components in the highly ionised outflow , with a factor @xmath04 difference in velocity as predicted for a shocked flow , although the high velocity component is probably blended with the fe xxv 1s-3p line .",
    "an apparent broadening of the absorption line at @xmath07.15 kev ( identified with fe lyman-@xmath9 and a outflow velocity range of @xmath05000 - 9000 km s@xmath1 ) is found in both analysis methods , notwithstanding the proximity of the fe k absorption edge in the broad band fit .",
    "the similarity to the broad absorption trough seen in the rgs data for oxygen lyman-@xmath9 ( paper ii ) again indicates matter of differing densities in a co - moving , decelerating flow .",
    "our analysis fits the excess flux in the @xmath05.5 - 7 kev interval with a narrow fe k emission line and a weak relativistic red wing .",
    "we note that the higher resolution ( but lower sensitivity )  hetg spectrum in lobban  ( 2011 ) finds a ` narrow ' line component almost a factor two broader than in our analysis , although a second fit with an unresolved core underlines the limitation of such simple gaussian fits .",
    "what is interesting is that both lobban  and our present analysis find a substantial fe k flux arising from weakly ionised matter with a projected velocity dispersion of order @xmath0@xmath18 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) .",
    "an appealing interpretation is that this component arises from continuum x - ray flux being scattered from the post - shock outflow , the velocity width implying a wide angle flow .",
    "comparison of individual orbit spectra with that of the summed data finds the ionisation state of the post shock flow , as determined by the ratio of line opacities of fe xxvi to fe xxv , is seen to fall over the first 5 orbits of the 2009 campaign , while the 7 - 10 kev luminosity , a proxy for the ionising flux affecting the fe k shell , varies very little . on the other hand ,",
    "the 0.3 - 3 kev luminosity increases from rev 1721 to rev 1727 by a factor @xmath02.3 , and simultaneous uv flux measurements show a similar increasing trend ( alston  2012 ) , suggesting the observed ionisation change is responding to enhanced cooling , with a lower gas temperature and corresponding increase in recombination rate . following that reasoning",
    "we can then understand the subsequent reversal to a higher ionisation parameter for the same flow component in revs 1728 and 1729 , where the 0.3 - 3 kev luminosity has fallen back by @xmath0 a third .",
    "if confirmed , the above interpretation of the absorption line variations over the first half of the 2009  campaign provides independent support for the shocked outflow model discussed in paper i , where strong cooling of the post - shock flow is a key to the ionisation - velocity correlation seen in the rgs spectra .",
    "however , while the soft x - ray flux has again increased by rev 1730 , that observation sees the largest ionising flux of the campaign , with the 7 - 10 kev luminosity a factor @xmath02 higher than in rev 1729 .",
    "the dominant 7.1 kev absorption line , also seen in the similarly high flux observation of 2001 ( rev 0263 ) , indicates a still higher ionisation parameter for the @xmath05000 - 7000 km s@xmath1 flow component , with photoionisation now dominating over compton cooling .",
    "if the line ratio change from rev 1729 to rev 1730 is indeed due to an ionising pulse , the @xmath02 day timescale is much shorter than for an ionising front travelling at the local sound speed ( @xmath171000 km s@xmath1 ) through the shell of post - shock gas , estimated in paper i to be of thickness @xmath0@xmath19 cm . alternatively , for an r - type ionisation front , moving into a low density medium , the response time",
    "will be governed by the recombination time . for an assumed post - shock temperature of @xmath00.1 kev ( paper i )",
    ", a recombination coefficient of @xmath20 ( verner and ferland 1996 ) would then relate the measured recombination timescale of @xmath0@xmath21 s to a mean ( electron ) density of @xmath0@xmath22 @xmath23 .    that value is consistent with the measured absorption column of n@xmath3@xmath0@xmath24 @xmath5 from the ionised fe absorption line ews , and a shell width ( paper i ) of @xmath0@xmath19 cm .",
    "comparison with a density of @xmath0@xmath25 @xmath23 deduced from variability in the oxygen rrc ( paper ii ) would support the interpretation of co - moving ionised o and fe flow components in pressure equilibrium with a temperature of 0.03 kev ( from rrc widths ) for the less ionised gas .",
    "a further implication of the inhomogeneous co - moving flow is that the ionisation parameters will differ in the ratio of the densities .",
    "while that ratio is somewhat less than the factor @xmath010 predicted for dominant o viii and fe xxv ion stages , the agreement is not unreasonable given the approximate nature of the above estimates .",
    "in paper i we noted that absorption in the immediate post - shock gas , observed at velocities up to v@xmath09000 km s@xmath1 and ionisation parameter to log@xmath2@xmath03 , implied the presence of a still higher velocity wind , with v@xmath036000 km s@xmath1 and log@xmath2@xmath03.6 .",
    "although the evidence presented in paper i for such a highly ionised wind was marginal , we noted the tombesi  ( 2010 ) report of the detection of an outflow at @xmath00.13c ( v@xmath039000 km s@xmath1 ) in the 2002  observation of .",
    "we have repeated the 2002 data analysis in section 6 , finding the @xmath08 kev absorption to be the only significant absorption line in the fe k spectral region , with its detection after 2 weeks of extreme low continuum flux being consistent with an increased fraction of fe xxvi in a highly ionised wind .",
    "the  and  observations of , some 6 months prior to the 2009  campaign , yielded absorption spectra showing no strong evidence in the soft x - ray band for outflow velocities @xmath151000 km s@xmath1 ( lobban  2011 ) .",
    "although the  spectra are somewhat less sensitive , it seems clear that the soft x - ray opacity at @xmath03000 - 9000 km s@xmath1 was significantly weaker than 6 months later . on the other hand ,",
    "the simultaneous  spectra did show a pair of strong absorption lines at @xmath06.8 and @xmath07.1 kev , interpreted - as here - with he- and h - like fe , with a projected outflow velocity of @xmath05000 - 7000 km s@xmath1 , but found no evidence for a higher velocity wind .",
    "an obvious way of reconciling the 2008 and 2009 data is that the high velocity wind was weaker during the earlier observation , leading to a lower opacity in the post - shock flow .",
    "the flow speed and recombination timescales we have deduced ( paper ii , and herein ) would readily allow for that different picture over a 6-month interval .",
    "in particular , a denser ( more massive ) post - shock flow evidenced by the strong @xmath03000 - 7000 km s@xmath1 absorbing flow seen in the rgs spectrum of 2009 would support an assumption that the fast wind was also blowing more strongly in 2009 than during the  and  campaign .",
    "emission from the pre - shock wind might be expected as a more persistent excess to the red wing of the absorption line at @xmath08 kev . however , for a spherical shell moving at v@xmath00.13c , any such feature would probably be correspondingly broad and difficult to detect .",
    "a near - sided conical flow as indicated in the rgs data ( paper ii ) would give a less broad feature and it is interesting to note the excess near @xmath07.8 kev in figure 4 . adding a positive gaussian to that fit , with a width @xmath8@xmath00.2 kev , matches that excess and also enhances the absorption line depths at @xmath07.75 and @xmath08 kev .",
    "the corresponding forward cone semi - angle is @xmath045@xmath13 , similar to that deduced from the rgs spectral analysis in paper ii and optical imaging of  ( christopoulou 1997 ) .    in general",
    ", we might expect the putative , highly ionised fast wind in  to be intermittent , with the required super - eddington condition for continuum driving ( king and pounds 2003 ) varying on the short ( viscous or thermal ) timescale of the inner disc . in that context",
    "it is important to note the very high column density required to detect a blue - shifted fe k absorption line in a low redshift source such as , while radial expansion could rapidly render undetectable the line - of - sight column density in an initially optically thick transient outflow .",
    "furthermore , the absence of the @xmath08 kev absorption line in rev 1730 ( and rev 0263 ) is consistent with the line - of - sight component of the putative pre - shock wind ( seen in fexxvi lyman-@xmath9 ) being more completely ionised by the stronger continuum @xmath157 kev .",
    "combining the pn data over the 600ks  observation of  shows a complex fe k profile which can be resolved into both narrow and broad ( red wing ) emission components and several absorption lines .",
    "the narrow fe k emission line has a mean energy consistent with fluorescence from weakly ionised matter and a line width consistent with scattering from the outflow seen in absorption .",
    "four blue - shifted absorption lines can be identified with fe xxv and fe xxvi resonance transitions consistent with line - of - sight outflow velocities separated by a factor @xmath04 , as expected for a fast highly ionised wind being shocked on impact with the ism or slower moving ejecta .",
    "comparing fe k profiles for individual orbits reveals significant changes on a few - day timescale , with the clear evidence for variations in the ionisation state of the post shock flow .",
    "while no strong correlation of absorption with continuum flux levels is found for all 15 observations over 45 days , shorter term trends strongly suggest a link of ionisation state with the soft x - ray ( and uv ) flux and - for the brightest orbit ( rev 1730 ) - with a factor 2 increase in hard x - ray flux .",
    "while the former link is important in offering support for the existence of shocked gas which is being cooled by disk photons , the rapid response to a pulse of ionising radiation can be interpreted in terms of a recombination timescale which yields an electron density of @xmath0@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "comparison with the somewhat higher density derived in paper ii from the rgs spectral analysis is consistent with two ionisation components in a co - moving flow .",
    "finally , we confirm an absorption line at @xmath08 kev in the 2009 summed spectrum , at a similar energy and ew to that found in the 2002 data as part of the tombesi  ( 2010 ) survey , and identified there with an outflow velocity of @xmath00.13c . in our more extended 2009 observations",
    "we find evidence that the @xmath08 kev line is variable , being stronger when the flux level is lower .",
    "the implication is that the fast wind is very highly ionised at moderate or high continuum flux levels , with fe predominently in fe xxvii .",
    "recombination to fe xxvi ( see possible rrc in figure 1 ) would then increase the wind opacity when the ionising flux level fell .",
    "we recall that a fully ionised wind is quite likely in the continuum driving model of black holes winds discussed by king and pounds ( 2003 ) .",
    "the results reported here are based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
