    "the scientometric investigation summarized in this paper paper provides some insights on the role of computing for high energy physics ( hep ) both in the context of scholarly publication and in the press .",
    "it aims at assessing the potential contribution of this domain to communicate the impact of high energy physics research on the society at large .    to carry out this analysis , a few landmark discoveries in particle physics",
    "have been investigated , to determine the impact of such events on scientific literature on one side , and their presence and visibility in the press on the other side in order to assess the social perception of this research domain .",
    "the data sources used in this analysis were thomson - reuters isi web of knowledge @xcite database ( covering 1970- to date ) , the collection of press releases of representative high energy physics laboratories ( cern , fermilab and slac ) and the online archives of some newspapers with strong circulation , such as the new york times , the times , the telegraph , the frankfurter allegemeine zeitung , die welt , le monde , le figaro , la repubblica and corriere della sera .",
    "the data collection for this analysis had to face some practical obstacles : the publicly accessible archives of press releases of major hep laboratories cover a limited time span and provide limited search facilities ; the online archives of most newspapers offer only limited free access and permit in general simple searches only .",
    "these limitations hinder the feasibility of a rigorous statistical study ; nevertheless a consistent picture of the field emerges from this investigation .    in the appraisal of the results reported in the following sections one should take into account that 2013 statistics cover only approximately 2/3 of the year , as they are limited to data collected before the chep 2013 conference",
    "the citation patterns of several papers associated with landmark experimental discoveries have been investigated .",
    "they include the first observation of the j/@xmath0 @xcite , the @xmath1 @xcite , the w and z@xmath2 @xcite at the cern sps collider , the top quark at the tevatron @xcite , of neutrino oscillations @xcite , and of cp violation in the k and b meson systems @xcite .",
    "the number of citations received by these papers is listed in table [ tab : hepcite ] .",
    "the time evolution of the citations of these papers shows evident similarities : the citation count exhibits an initial high peak , but it drops dramatically after 3 to 5 years following the publication of the papers announcing the discoveries .",
    "some examples are illustrated in figures [ fig : jpsi]-[fig : topl ] .    at this stage",
    "it is too early to evaluate whether the papers documenting the first observation of the higgs boson will experience a similar citation rate .",
    ".[tab : hepcite]citations collected by representative hep physics and software papers . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     time profile of the citations of the papers documenting the first observation of the @xmath1 . ]",
    "time profile of the citations of the papers documenting the first observation of the @xmath1 . ]    time profile of the citations of the papers documenting the first observation of the top quark . ]    time profile of the citations of the papers documenting the first observation of the top quark .",
    "]    the relatively short citation lifetime of papers documenting major hep experimental discoveries contrasts with the extended citation life of fundamental theoretical papers in the same domain : and example is shown in figures [ fig : km]-[fig : belle ] , which report the citation profiles of the landmark kobayashi - maskawa paper @xcite and of representative experimental observations of cp violation @xcite .",
    "time profile of the citations of the observation of cp violation in the belle experiment . ]    time profile of the citations of the observation of cp violation in the belle experiment . ]    time profile of the citations of the observation of cp violation in the belle experiment . ]    time profile of the citations of the observation of cp violation in the belle experiment . ]",
    "when it comes to analyzing the impact in terms of visibility of experimental particle physics discoveries in the press , one can observe a correlation between their presence in mass - circulation newspapers and press releases issued by major particle physics laboratories .",
    "the high visibility in the mainstream media of the discovery of the higgs boson is well known : admittedly , it was the result of a deliberate communication effort to promote particle physics .",
    "we found a number of other cases , where formal communication to the press of events related to high energy physics leads to articles in widely read newspapers .",
    "as an example , one can take the announcement about the observation of matter - antimatter asymmetry in the lhcb experiment ( cern press release of the 24th of april 2013 ) , which is reflected on the same day in articles published on the telegraph and the italian corriere della sera .",
    "other examples are the announcements of the production of antihydrogen and a new state of matter ( cern press releases of the 18th september 2002 and the 10th february 2000 , respectively ) , which which raised immediate and long - lasting attention in the press : articles on this subject were published on various newspapers in the next days , such as the new york times , le monde , le figaro , la repubblica , die welt and the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .",
    "the scholarly publication @xcite documenting the production of antihydrogen had received 463 citations at the time of the chep 2013 conference .",
    "similarly , the discovery of the top quark announced by fermilab in a press release on the 2nd march 1995 found immediate echo in the press both in us and european newspapers .",
    "correlation between press releases by major laboratories and articles in mass - circulation newspapers is observed not only regarding major particle physics discoveries , but also technological achievements : examples are the the lowering of the heaviest part of the cms detector in the lhc tunnel ( cern press release of the 28th february 2007 ) and an internet speed record achieved in transferring data between cern and caltech ( cern press release of 15th october 2003 ) : the corresponding stories can be found in newspapers such as die welt , la repubblica and the new york times in the days following the press release .",
    "these examples ( and others not mentioned here due to the limited page allocation in these conference proceedings ) show that the press releases are an effective strategy for communicating the scientific advances to the general public .",
    "if we now move to the computing domain , we observe that only the grid reaches high and long - lasting visibility in the mainstream press , besides the web technology development . stories in major newspapers related to these subjects are associated with a significant number of cern press releases .",
    "if we now turn our attention to papers on software development related to experimental particle physics , we note that some of them obtain a high score in terms of citations , but also enjoy a long - lasting impact in the scientific publishing arena .",
    "representative cases in this domain are minuit @xcite and geant4 @xcite .",
    "minuit reference paper @xcite was published shortly after the discovery of the j/@xmath0 ; at the time of the chep 2013 conference it had received 1330 citations , distributed as shown in figure [ fig : minuit ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note in figure [ fig : jpsi_minuit ] that approximately five years after the discovery of the j/@xmath0 the number of minuit yearly citations was comparable to that of this landmark physics discovery , while nowadays the citations of minuit largely outnumber those received by the j/@xmath0 papers .",
    "the first geant4 reference paper @xcite had received 4295 citations at the time of the chep 2013 conference .",
    "it is the most cited paper in the categories of particle and fields physics ( encompassing 264075 papers ) , nuclear science and technology , and instruments and instrumentation ( jointly encompassing 618147 papers ) .",
    "these numbers result from a citation analysis performed on 9 october 2013 , based on thomson - reuters web of science @xcite .",
    "this paper is also the most cited publication of cern ( i.e. including cern authors ) .    to the best of our efforts",
    ", no mention of hep scientific software and its achievements could be found in cern press releases , nor in the mainstream press .",
    "given the observed correlation between visibility to the general public and communication from major laboratories , one could extrapolate a similar correlation also regarding the lack of attention to this hep research domain .",
    "the time profile of the citations of the minuit paper and the almost contemporary papers about the discovery of the j/@xmath0 . ]    the time profile of the citations of the minuit paper and the almost contemporary papers about the discovery of the j/@xmath0 . ]",
    "the citations of these hep software systems exhibit a distinctive pattern regarding their origin , which is largely different from the typical patterns associated with hep papers .",
    "the vast majority of the citations of experimental hep publications originate from the same subject area and a few closely related fields , such as astroparticle physics and nuclear physics : as an example , the journals from which more than 90% of the citations of representative lep and lhc physics papers originate are shown in figure [ fig_exp_physcite ] .",
    "the citations of minuit and geant4 show a largely multidisciplinary character , as is illustrated in figures [ fig : minuitorigin ] and [ fig : g4origin ] . for both software systems the citations originating from areas other than high energy physics outnumber those deriving from hep .",
    "these citation patterns document the impact of the technological research motivated by hep experiments on other domains , some of which have evident social impact ( e.g. the large number of geant4 citations originating from the bio - medical environment ) .",
    "domains of origin of geant4 citations . ]    domains of origin of geant4 citations . ]",
    "this scientometric analysis has assessed some distinctive patterns in scholarly publications and visibility in mainstream media of high energy physics experimental discoveries and scientific software systems .",
    "major experimental discoveries are characterized by short - lived citation patterns , which exhibit a rapid drop shortly after the observation .",
    "major hep software systems , such as minuit and geant4 , collect citations over an extended period , which demonstrates their continued contribution to the advancement of science .",
    "their citations have a multidisciplinary nature , which contrasts with the narrower scope of the citations collected by hep experiments , mostly originating from the hep community itself and a few closely related domains .",
    "visibility in mainstream media appears associated with communications to the press issued by major hep institutes .",
    "press releases and the associated stories in mass - circulation media contribute to determine the social perception of high energy physics research among the general public .",
    "the results of this scientometric analysis document the impact of scientific software research motivated by hep experiments on domains other than high energy physics , including some of evident social relevance . they could provide objective support for improved communication of the benefits of hep research and developments via press releases from the major hep institutes .",
    "the authors wish to thank the cern library for providing essential tools to this scientometric analysis ."
