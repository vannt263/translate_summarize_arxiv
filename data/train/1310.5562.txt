    "magnetic fields are present at different scales in the universe , from planets to stars , galaxies and galaxy clusters . in the case of stars , they play an important role at all stages of stellar evolution , from the collapse of the molecular cloud , through the pre - main sequence and main sequence phases to more evolved stages including supernovae , white dwarfs and neutron stars . they influence and control a number of physical processes , such as accretion , diffusion , mass - loss , angular momentum loss , and turbulence .",
    "thus , studying the characteristics and generation of stellar magnetic fields is a necessary step to increase our understanding of stellar evolution ( and also planetary formation and evolution ) .",
    "the sun is the closest - and thus the best studied - star .",
    "the discovery of its magnetic field goes back to the beginning of the 20th century when hale , using the newly discovered zeeman effect ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zeeman 1897 ) ) , found that sunspots are magnetic features ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hale 1908 ) ) .",
    "we now know that many observed features are due to magnetic fields , such as spots , faculae , and coronal mass ejection .",
    "the solar magnetic field evolves in time .",
    "sunspots emerge in mid - latitude activity belts , and the latitudes of these activity belts migrate towards the equator on a timescale of 11 years .",
    "this gives the well know butterfly diagram .",
    "i will refer to this cycle as the activity cycle .",
    "however , the large - scale magnetic field of the sun varies on a different timescale .",
    "the polarity of the field flips every 11 years , meaning that the large - scale cycle is actually 22 years .",
    "activity cycles are observed on a number of other stars by studying activity proxies for magnetic fields such as caii h&k and x - rays ( for reviews , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "sun - like stars with outer convective layers like the sun generate their magnetic field by dynamo mechanisms active in these outer layers ( e.g. @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* charbonneau(2010 ) ) for a review on solar dynamo models ) .",
    "the study of the magnetic field of sun - like stars therefore brings new insights and constraints to the current dynamo theories .",
    "this enhances our knowledge of the large - scale magnetic fields of stars , which allows us to test how ` normal ' the sun is in a sample of sun - like stars .",
    "the results i review here are for sun - like stars of spectral types f , g and k , having masses between @xmath0 and 1.5 m@xmath1 .",
    "they have different depths of the outer convective envelope .",
    "comparing stars with different properties can lead to a better understanding of the dynamo generation of the field .",
    "in order to study large - scale stellar magnetic fields , one can examine the polarisation in the spectral lines . if a magnetic field is present where those lines are formed , due to the zeeman effect , spectral lines will be polarised ( the polarisation level depends on the magnetic sensitivity of the particular line ) .",
    "the polarisation properties depend on the position of the observer relative to the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , circular polarisation is sensitive to the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) ) .",
    "the aim of magnetic mapping is to reconstruct stellar large - scale magnetic field orientation , geometry and strength .",
    "when the star rotates , the observer sees different parts of the stellar disc .",
    "if those parts have different magnetic field distributions , the polarisation in the spectral lines will not be the same in spectra taken at different rotational phases .",
    "thus , the technique used to reconstruct the large - scale magnetic field is a tomographic technique , like the one used in magnetic resonence imaging .",
    "it is called zeeman - doppler imaging ( zdi ) , and consists of inverting series of circular polarised spectra into a magnetic topology , i.e. the distribution of magnetic fluxes and field orientations ( ) . since the inversion problem is ill - posed , regularisation techniques are used to get a unique map .",
    "these techniches include maximum entropy (; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hussain et al . 2000 ) ) and tikhonov regularisation ( ) .",
    "the results presented here are mostly obtained using the maximum entropy method .",
    "the magnetic field is described by its radial poloidal , non - radial poloidal and toroidal components , all described using spherical harmonics expansions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donati et al . 2006a ) ) .",
    "zdi is a powerful technique in recovering the large - scale magnetic field of the star , as well as its differential rotation .",
    "however , it has its limitations , because the small - scale fields are not resolved up to a certain limit , their signatures cancel out in some field geometries , and the field in dark spots is suppressed ( see , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* johnstone et al . 2010 ) ) .",

    "one can question if this relation holds for stars , and what we can learn about the generation of their magnetic fields .",

    "* fares et al .",
    "if this is the real period of the cycle , not only is it much shorter than the solar one , but it is also almost twice the 116 day period found in the caii data .",
    "@xcite attempted to detect an x - ray cycle for @xmath16  boo by observing the star over 6 epochs .",
    "although the star exhibits variability in x - ray , it does not show a cyclic behavior .",

    "field strengths vary between a few gauss to a few hundred gauss . despite this variety , there are trends with stellar properties , especially the rossby number .",
    "sun - like stars with rossby numbers smaller than unity have mainly toroidal magnetic fields , while stars with rossby numbers greater than unity seem to have weaker magnetic fields , dominated by the poloidal components .",
