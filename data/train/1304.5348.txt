    "open systems , where a system continuously exchanges information , such as energy and mass , with its environment have been extensively studied due to their practical relevance and the theoretical interest they engender .",
    "friction , joule heating , and viscous drag  @xcite are ubiquitous examples of open - systems with losses , that exhibit one - way ( energy ) transfer to the environment . in contrast , open - systems with gains are rare , and are mostly realized in optical settings  @xcite . over the past decade , theoretical research has predicted that open systems with `` balanced loss and gain '' exhibit novel properties that are absent in traditional open systems  @xcite .",
    "such systems are described by equations of motion that are invariant under combined parity and time - reversal ( @xmath0 ) operations ; the resulting solutions , however , may or may not share that symmetry  @xcite . although the field of @xmath0-symmetric quantum theories started out with spectral properties of non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric continuum hamiltonians , it has become evident that @xmath0 symmetric systems , classical or quantum , represents a special class of open systems that have both sources and sinks . over the past three years , experiments on a wide variety of systems with balanced loss and gain - coupled optical systems  @xcite , coupled electrical oscillators  @xcite , and coupled mechanical oscillators  @xcite - have demonstrated the surprising properties of such systems , such as unidirectional invisibility at optical frequencies  @xcite .",
    "this novel behavior arises from the _ asymmetries _ in the solutions of equations of motion .",
    "mathematically , symmetries of equations of motion , along with those of the boundary conditions , determine the symmetry properties of their solutions . for systems described by linear equations of motion , it is straightforward to obtain solutions with specific symmetries by linear superposition of linearly independent solutions .",
    "for example , the schrdinger equation for a quantum particle in an even potential @xmath1 is invariant under the parity transformation @xmath2 , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are either odd or even ; if the initial state @xmath3 of the particle has a definite parity symmetry , that symmetry is preserved during the time evolution  @xcite . on the other hand , with an even initial wavefunction @xmath4 ,",
    "if the potential @xmath5 is not even , the time - evolved wave function @xmath6 will develops an asymmetry @xmath7 that is determined by the asymmetry in the potential , @xmath8 .",
    "thus , generically , if a system with initial conditions that have a specific symmetry is evolved according to equations of motion that do not share the symmetry , the resulting solution will develop ( time - dependent ) asymmetries .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the dependence of such asymmetries in incompressible viscous flows subject to @xmath0-symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "we emphasize here that experimentally investigated @xmath0-symmetric systems  @xcite had both dissipation and amplification of energy . due to this balanced situation",
    ", they displayed a positive threshold for the loss / gain strength above which the solutions of equation of motion develop asymmetry .",
    "in contrast , the system considered in this paper is viscous and dissipative , with no attendant energy amplification , and therefore we expect that the asymmetries of flow solutions are always nonzero .",
    "the notions of inflow ( mass - gain , energy - gain ) and outflow ( mass - loss , non - dissipative energy - loss ) occur most naturally in fluid systems .",
    "traditional viscous flows are driven by upwind flow , pressure difference , or boundary movement , and therefore the steady - state velocity profiles at the inlet and the outlet are , in general , unrelated .",
    "in particular , flow symmetry properties in a system with specified inflow and outflow velocity profiles remain largely unexplored  @xcite . viscous fluid flow with porous walls that act as",
    "inlets or outlets has been extensively studied  @xcite , although not with symmetric boundary conditions that are investigated in this paper .",
    "the incompressible fluid dynamics is governed by nonlinear navier - stokes ( ns ) equation , @xmath9 and the continuity equation @xmath10 . here",
    "the reynolds number @xmath11 is defined by the characteristic inlet velocity @xmath12 , the width of the inlet @xmath13 , and the kinematic viscosity @xmath14 of the fluid . for steady - state solutions , @xmath15 , the effects of nonlinear , convective derivative",
    "are suppressed at small reynolds number . at moderate to large values of reynolds number , @xmath16 ,",
    "the nonlinear effects can not be ignored and thus the symmetry properties of steady - state solutions of eq.([eq : nse ] ) are not straightforward , and usually analytically intractable except in special cases  @xcite .",
    "we use lattice boltzmann method ( lbm )  @xcite to numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : nse ] ) through an existing c program for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) channel which had been previously validated . originated from the lattice gas automata ,",
    "the lbm has emerged as a popular alternative to model and simulate complex viscous flows  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea of this method is to construct simple kinetic models for spatially and temporally discretized particle - distribution functions that incorporate the essential physics of mesoscopic processes .",
    "the desired hydrodynamic variables in macroscopic equations are obtained from the moments of the particle - distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "although in the nearly - incompressible limit , the lattice boltzmann equations recover the incompressible ns equations through the chapmann - enskog technique  @xcite , the computational philosophy of lbm is vastly different from traditional continuum ns - solvers .",
    "the main features that distinguish the lbm from continuum approaches are fourfold .",
    "i ) the viscous diffusion in continuum solvers is replaced by a local relaxation process ( collision operator ) towards a local equilibrium state in lbm .",
    "ii ) a linear convection operator in lbm generates the nonlinear macroscopic advection - the @xmath17 term - through multiscale expansions .",
    "iii ) for incompressible and isothermal single flows , such as the flow studied here , the particle distribution function is the only unknown to be determined , and the pressure distribution @xmath18 is obtained from the equation of state .",
    "iv ) computations required to obtain the particle distribution function are purely local .",
    "the distribution function at a point @xmath19 depends only on its values at neighboring points , both spatially and temporally .",
    "hence , the potential of lbm for parallelization is excellent .",
    "another major advantage of the lbm is that its implementation is fairly simple and can be easily validated .",
    "both two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) lbm codes used in this work were validated by testing their nearly identical agreement with the analytical solutions of poiseuille flows .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce `` balanced inflow and outflow '' configurations of viscous flow in both 2d and 3d domains .",
    "the inlet and outlet velocity profiles , together with the geometry of the flow domain , are characterized by invariance under combined parity ( reflection ) and time - reversal operations .",
    "we investigate the asymmetries of the resultant steady - state flow .",
    "a class of @xmath0-asymmetries in velocity , kinetic energy density , and vorticity is defined and its dependences on the reynolds number and distinct configurations of `` balanced '' inflow and outflow are studied .",
    "our salient results are as follows : i ) the asymmetries for three variables , the velocity @xmath20 , the kinetic energy density @xmath21 , and vorticity @xmath22 , exhibit specific power - law scaling with the reynolds number ; the power - law exponent is determined by the asymmetry definition , but not the variable .",
    "ii ) the asymmetries in the balanced inflow - outflow configuration are suppressed by orders of magnitude when compared with those in traditional fully - developed - flow configuration .",
    "iii ) the power - law scaling is valid in both two and three dimensions .",
    "we emphasize that the total mass flux at the inlet is always equal to that at the outlet .",
    "thus , the phrase `` balanced inflow and outflow '' implies symmetry constraints on the velocity profile at the inlet and the outlet .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "analytical considerations , discussed in sec .  [ se : results ] , imply that identical power - law scaling of asymmetries in all three variables is expected at small @xmath23 , but the scaling appears to hold at higher values of reynolds numbers as well , @xmath24 .",

    "[ se : disc ] .",
    "we start with the definition of balanced inflow and outflow conditions and show how they relate to @xmath0 symmetries satisfied by the velocity profile at the boundaries .",
    "it is noted that for an incompressible flow in a rigid container , the mass inflow flux is equal to the outflow flux .",
    "thus , we use the term balanced - inflow - outflow to denote a much stronger constraint on the fluid velocity at the inlet and outlet boundaries . as the first step ,",
