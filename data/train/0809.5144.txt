    "the @xmath0 lepton , with a mass of @xmath1 mev  @xcite , is the only lepton heavy enough to decay both leptonically and hadronically .",
    "it decays approximately 65% of the time to one or more hadrons .",
    "the reconstruction and identification of @xmath0 leptons are important in many searches for new phenomena , and they can appear in final states during the production of higgs bosons or supersymmetric particles  @xcite . this paper will discuss the reconstruction and identification of hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons with the atlas detector  @xcite .",
    "hadronically decaying @xmath0 candidates are reconstructed using at least one of two possible seed types .",
    "the first seed type is a track with @xmath2 gev .",
    "this leading track must satisfy further quality criteria to be considered a valid seed for a @xmath0 candidate .",
    "the second type of seed consists of jets reconstructed using topological clusters ( topoclusters )  @xcite with @xmath3 gev .",
    "topoclusters are formed using cells that exceed calorimeter noise by 4@xmath4 , and neighbouring cells that exceed energy thresholds above calorimeter noise by 2@xmath4 and 0@xmath4 are associated to the cluster in a second and third step , respectively .",
    "these topoclusters are then grouped into a topojet using a seeded cone algorithm  @xcite with a cone radius of @xmath5 which form the aforementioned seeds for @xmath0 candidates .",
    "these topojets are then matched to seed tracks in a cone of radius @xmath6 around the topojet .",
    "if such a match is found , the @xmath0 candidate is considered as having two valid seeds . for reconstructed @xmath0 leptons in @xmath7 events ,",
    "70% of @xmath0 candidates have two valid seeds , 25% have only a topojet seed , and 5% have only a track seed .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 candidate is calculated in two ways . for @xmath0 candidates with a topojet seed ,",
    "the cells in a cone of @xmath8 are summed and weighted using a calibration similar to that used for the liquid argon calorimeter of the h1 experiment  @xcite .",
    "scale factors , determined from monte carlo and depending on the @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the @xmath0 candidate , are used to further correct the energy scale .    for @xmath0 candidates with a track seed ,",
    "an energy flow approach is used , where energy deposits in cells matched to charged tracks are subtracted and replaced by the momenta of such tracks .",
    "this energy of the @xmath0 candidate is also corrected for energy leakage coming from charged particles outside the narrow cone .",
    "tracks associated to the @xmath0 candidate in a cone of @xmath6 are required to pass track quality criteria , albeit less stringent than those for the leading track .",
    "figure  [ track_dist_inv_mass ] ( left ) shows the track multiplicity distribution for @xmath0 candidates matched to true hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons .",
    "topoclusters found in the electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter with @xmath11 gev that are isolated from tracks are interpreted as energy deposits from @xmath12 mesons in the @xmath0 lepton decay .",
    "we find that approximately 66% of @xmath13 decays are reconstructed with zero @xmath12 subclusters , while more than 50% of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) decays are reconstructed with one ( two ) @xmath12 subcluster(s ) .",
    "based on the calorimeter information , the associated tracks and reconstructed @xmath12 clusters , a variety of other variables are calculated to be used for the identification of @xmath0 leptons .",
    "these variables include the radius of the @xmath0 candidate in the em calorimeter , isolation variables for the calorimeter energy and tracks , reconstructed charge ( based on the associated tracks ) , and the invariant mass of the @xmath0 candidate .",
    "the invariant mass distribution for selected @xmath0 candidates based on the above mentioned variables is shown in figure  [ track_dist_inv_mass ] ( right ) .",
    "because of the large production cross section for qcd jets , identification methods are needed to discriminate @xmath0 candidates arising from true @xmath0 lepton decay and those from qcd processes .",
    "identification methods are also used to distinguish hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons from electrons and muons . at atlas , various identification methods have been studied , ranging from simple cut - based criteria , to multivariate techniques such as : projective likelihoods ( lh ) , boosted decision trees , neural networks , and probabilty range searches . here , only cut - based vetoes against muons and electrons and the projective likelihood discriminant against qcd jets will be discussed .",
    "muons are vetoed by requiring that the calorimetric energy deposited by the @xmath0 candidate has @xmath16 gev . for electrons ,",
    "cuts are placed upon 1-prong @xmath0 candidates on the following two quantities : the ratio of the transverse energy deposited in the em calorimeter to the track transverse momentum which tends to be higher for electrons than for charged hadrons , and the ratio of high threshold hits to low threshold hits in the transition radiation tracker for the track , which also tends to be higher for electrons",
    ". this veto suppresses electrons from @xmath17 events by a factor of 60 , while retaining a 95% efficiency for @xmath0 leptons in @xmath18 .    discriminating variables used to distinguish @xmath0 leptons from qcd jets include : radius and profile of em calorimeter energy deposits , track width distributions , isolation variables calculated from calorimetric energy deposits and tracks , impact parameter significance of the leading track , invariant mass of the associated tracks , ratios of energy deposits to the sum of track transverse momenta , and the transverse flight path significance of the @xmath0 candidate vertex .",
    "sample distributions of a subset of these variables are shown in figure  [ vardists ] .",
    "the lh takes these variables and forms probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for @xmath0 leptons ( signal ) and jets ( background ) , which are separated into the following categories : the @xmath9 of the @xmath0 candidate , the number of associated tracks , valid seed types , and the presence of @xmath12 subclusters .",
    "a likelihood ratio is formed using the product of individual likelihood ratios for the signal and background hypothesis in each variable .",
    "the performance of the lh is shown in figure  [ llhperf ] for 1-prong and 3-prong @xmath0 candidates . for @xmath0 candidates with @xmath19 gev",
    ", a 40% @xmath0 identification efficiency corresponds to a qcd jet rejection of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for 1-prong ( 3-prong ) candidates .",
    "atlas is planning an extensive program to investigate physics channels with hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons in the final state .",
    "sensitivity to such channels requires robust reconstruction algorithms and well performing identification methods to distinguish true @xmath0 leptons from qcd jets , electrons , and muons .",
    "studies for extracting cross sections for standard model processes such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 production with hadronic @xmath0 leptons in the final state have been performed  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of these standard model processes will aid the understanding of searches for new physical phenomena with final state @xmath0 leptons ."
