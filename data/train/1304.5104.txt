    "higgs physics may be related the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario@xcite , in order to generate the baryon number in the electroweak phase transition , it is necessary that the phase transition is strong first - order .",
    "this criterion is quantitatively described as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the critical temperature of the electroweak phase transition and @xmath7 is the magnitude of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs at @xmath8 .",
    "it is known that in the standard model ( sm ) the phase transition is second - order for @xmath9 gev .",
    "thus if the higgs mass is @xmath1 gev as overfed in lhc , it is difficult to obtain the baryon asymmetry through the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) .",
    "therefore , in order to make the electroweak baryogenesis work successfully , the higgs sector in the sm should be extended .    in this presentation",
    "we briefly report the ewpt in a particular model of the gauge - higgs unification ( ghu)@xcite . in the gauge - higgs unification scenario@xcite , the higgs field is regarded as the zero - mode of the extra - dimensional component of the gauge field in the higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking is triggered by the non - trivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson - line phase .",
    "this is what we call the hosotani mechanism@xcite .",
    "it has been reported that in ghu models the thermal phase transition is strong first order@xcite . in this presentation",
    "we report the ewpt in a realistic ghu model which reproduce appropriate higgs mass @xmath1 gev .",
    "we consider the model in @xcite .",
    "this is an @xmath11 gauge theory in the randall - sundrum space - time.@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the curvature of the five - dimensional anti - de sitter space .",
    "the @xmath14 gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath15 by the boundary conditions at @xmath16 .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking is by the vev of the 5-dimensional component of the gauge field @xmath17 in the direction of @xmath18 .",
    "the magnitude of the vev is parameterized by the wilson - line phase @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20 = \\exp[i g_a ] \\int_1^{z_l } dz \\langle a_z \\rangle$ ] ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .    in order to study the phase structure of this model ,",
    "we evaluate the effective potential at finite temperature .",
    "the effective potential consists of zero - tempereture effective potential and the finite - temperature corrections : @xmath23 the zero temperature part of the effective potential @xmath24 is calculated by the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath24 in this model can be seen in refs .",
    "finite temperature corrections are given by @xmath25 + g [ \\ { m_{n}^{(z ) } \\ } , 0 ] + g [ \\ { m_{n}^{(h ) } \\},0 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + g [ \\ { m_{n}^{(t)}\\},\\tfrac{1}{2 } ]   + g [ \\ { m_{n}^{(f)}\\ } , \\tfrac{1}{2 } ]   \\biggr\\ } , \\\\",

    "this model contains two free parameters , namely , the warp factor @xmath29 and the number of the spinorial - representation fermion @xmath30 . in this report",
    "we consider the case with @xmath4 . the effective potential is numerically evaluated . in fig .",

    "where @xmath37 gev @xcite .",
    "the blue - solid [ red - dashed ] line is for @xmath38 [ @xmath39 gev ] .",
    "the downward - arrow indicates the position of the nontrivial minimum at @xmath8 .",
    ", width=302 ]    we note that at @xmath40 there are two minima of the potential , one of which is @xmath41 and the other is @xmath42 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - ph07 ] , the position of the minimum of the effective potential , @xmath19 with respect to the temperature @xmath43 for @xmath44 is plotted .     for @xmath45 and @xmath4 .",
    "at @xmath46 gev a tiny gap is observed.,width=302 ]    the position @xmath19 monotonically decreases as @xmath43 increases , and there are tiny gap at @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath48 , @xmath19 vanishes and the @xmath49 symmetry restores .",
    "this is a first order phase transition but it also seems very weak and almost second order .    in order to check the criterion ( [ shapo ] ) , we define @xmath7 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the position of the non - trivial minimum of @xmath31 at @xmath40 . in table",
    "[ tab - td ] , we summarized @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the various value of @xmath29 for @xmath4 .",
    ".critical temperatures , magnitudes of the vacuum expectation value @xmath7 for various values of @xmath29 with @xmath4 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath6 varies from @xmath2 gev to @xmath52 gev for @xmath53 .",
    "in particular @xmath54 for @xmath3 .",
    "the values @xmath55 are much smaller than unity for all values of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore this model does not fulfill the criterion eq .",
    "( [ shapo ] ) for @xmath4 .",
    "the thermal phase transition of the @xmath0 gauge - higgs unification model which reproduce the @xmath1 gev higgs mass was studied .",
    "the effective potential of the gauge - higgs unification at finite temperature was formulated , and phase structure of the @xmath56 gauge - higgs unification model was studied .",
    "it is found that the thermal phase transition in the model is very weak first order or almost second - order .",
    "this implies the electroweak baryogenesis can not occur successfully in this model because the baryon - number is washed - out by the sphaleron .",
    "the result does not exclude the possibility to reproduce the baryon number by other mechanism , e.g. leptogenesis .",
    "it might be possible to make the first - order phase transition stronger by introducing supersymmetry into the model@xcite , in analog with the enhanced first - order phase transition in the sm with supersymmetry@xcite .",
