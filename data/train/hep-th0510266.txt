    "[ sect.sol.2nd.class.constr ] we show how to eliminate all the second class constraints by a non linear change of the variables @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. _ , by choosing a set of suitable coordinates in the phase space ( [ phase.space.coord ] ) , ( [ phase.space.momenta ] ) , and by introducing dirac brackets .    in sect .",
    "[ sect.sol.1st.class.constr ] we introduce the first quantization of the model and provide the solution of the first class constraints .",
    "in such a way we obtain the wave equations for the massive particles with spin and electric charge .",
    "it appears that the wavefunction is determined in the four - momentum space , because in twistor formalism the composite four - momenta are commuting .",
    "the composite spacetime coordinates @xmath59 , defined by ( [ penroseincidence.2twistor ] ) and ( [ complex.space-time ] ) , are non - commutative due to the following poisson bracket @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the pauli - lubaski four - vector .",
    "it follows , however , from ( [ x.non-commutative ] ) that @xmath62 what implies that our quantum - mechanical wavefunction for the non - vanishing spin case can depend on the projection @xmath63 of the spacetime four - vector defining covariantized scalar time coordinate .    in sect .",
    "[ sect.examples ] we present a brief outlook .",
    "we describe the dynamics of a massive spinning particle by its trajectory in the generalized coordinate space @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the spacetime vector of position , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are two pairs of commuting weyl spinors and the four quantities @xmath69 , satisfying the reality condition @xmath70 , are lorentz scalars .",

    "we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath38 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are taken from ( [ p - x])-([p - s ] ) and the definitions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are @xmath87 the pauli - lubaski four - vector is given by the formula @xmath88 where the relations @xmath89 , @xmath90 have been used . inserting the expressions ( [ p - x])-([p - s ] ) in ( [ 1bbisnoe ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 in fact , only the traceless part of @xmath93 is present in ( [ 2noe ] ) .",

    "we take the physical constraints in the following form can be obtained by considering the symmetries of the action ( [ act ] ) .",
    "it appears that the choice ( [ mass])-([q ] ) and the interpretation of @xmath102 ( see ( [ lagva2.18 ] ) ) as covariant spin projection is related with the formulae for the corresponding noether charges . ]",
    "@xmath103the real quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 which are present in ( [ s])-([q ] ) are defined in terms of the lagrangian variables @xmath106 as follows @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the constraint ( [ mass ] ) defines the mass @xmath109 of the particle because using it together with ( [ 5bisnoe ] ) we obtain that @xmath110 the constraints ( [ s ] ) and ( [ s-3 ] ) are introduced in the action ( [ act ] ) in order to obtain a definite spin @xmath111 and the covariant spin projection @xmath112 whereas the constraint ( [ q ] ) defines the @xmath113 charge @xmath114 of the particle .    in the subsection [ sect.timeevolution ]",
    "we shall see , from the preservation of the constraints in time , that secondary constraints do not appear in our model .",
    "thus , the full set of constraints is given by the physical constraints ( [ mass])-([q ] ) and by the primary ones ( [ c : p - x])-([c : p - s ] ) .",
    "if we transform the twelve constraints ( [ c : p - x ] ) , ( [ c : p - pi ] ) to equivalent lorentz - invariant expressions by contracting them with the spinors @xmath66 and @xmath115 ( the matrices @xmath116 are invertible due to ( [ pipi1])-([pipi4 ] ) ) the discussion of the constraints is simplified and their splitting into first and second class is clearer .",
    "after such contractions , the eight expressions ( [ c : p - pi ] ) take the form @xmath117 by considering the sum and the difference of the expressions above , we obtain the following set of eight constraints @xmath118 where the quantities @xmath119 contain only spinorial phase space variables .    the four constraints ( [ c : p - x ] ) , after contraction with spinors , take the form @xmath120 where we take into account ( [ 5bisnoe ] ) and ( [ p - x ] ) and introduce the following notation @xmath121 note that the spinorial bilinears introduce an orthogonal basis @xmath122 defined by ( [ 3noe ] ) or equivalently @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "then , the relation ( [ px ] ) can be written also as follows @xmath125    the algebra of the constraints ( [ d , b ] ) , ( [ px ] ) and ( [ c : p - s ] ) becomes more transparent if we introduce the following @xmath42 scalar and vector quantities:@xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130where @xmath108 , @xmath131 are the isospin pauli matrices . in terms of the variables ( [ d , b - r,0])-([s , p - r,0 ] ) and ( [ lagva2.18 ] ) the constraints ( [ d , b ] ) , ( [ px ] ) and ( [ c : p - s ] ) take the form@xmath132thus , our full set of the constraints is described now by the four physical constraints ( [ mass])-([q ] ) and by the sixteen primary constraints ( [ const - ps])-([const - px ] ) .",
    "we present now the canonical poisson brackets of the coordinates ( [ coord ] ) and their momenta ( [ p - x])-([p - s ] ) @xmath133 these allow us to compute the poisson brackets between the quantities ( [ cald , b - r,0])-([calp - r,0 ] ) .",
    "the the non - vanishing ones are@xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136from ( [ caldb ] ) we see that the three quantities @xmath137 are the generators of @xmath138 and the three quantities @xmath139 extend the @xmath140 algebra to the lorentz symmetry @xmath141 . because the generators @xmath137 , @xmath142 are scalars we shall call them internal symmetry generators .    from ( [ caldbp ] ) , ( [ calbpf ] ) we see that the quantities @xmath143 , @xmath144 which describe the covariant projections of the four - momentum on the composite four - vectors ( [ 3noe ] ) extend the internal lorentz generators @xmath145 to an internal poincar algebra .",
    "finally , we can write the complete list of non - vanishing poisson brackets between all twenty constraints in our model ( four physical constraints ( [ mass])-([q ] ) and sixteen primary ones ( [ const - ps])-([const - px ] ) ) : @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151      the action ( [ act ] ) is invariant under an arbitrary rescaling on the world line @xmath152 and the canonical hamiltonian vanishes @xmath153 the total hamiltonian is given , therefore , by a linear combination of all the constraints @xmath154    imposing the preservation of all the constraints in time ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) we find that four out of twenty lagrange multipliers are not determined . the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) takes the following final form @xmath155 where@xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159describe the four first class constraints .",

    "in the present paper we have described a classical and first - quantized model of massive relativistic particles with spin based on a hybrid geometry of phase space , with primary spacetime coordinates @xmath59 and composite four - momenta @xmath38 expressed in terms of fundamental spinorial variables .",
    "these spinorial coordinates describe half of the two - twistor spinorial degrees of freedom .",
    "one can say that the employed geometric framework is half way between the purely twistorial and the standard spacetime approaches .",

    "it should be added that the two - twistor degrees of freedom were studied recently by one of the authors and applied to the spacetime description of massive spinning particles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the difference with our approach here consists in the choice of the primary geometric variables which in @xcite-@xcite contains , besides two - twistor degrees of freedom , a primary internal @xmath42 spinor , called the index spinor @xcite . in the present paper",
    "all the degrees of freedom describing massive particles with spin and internal charge are derived entirely from the two - twistor geometry .",
    "one of the features of the description of spin in the twistor framework as well as in our model is the use of an orthogonal reference frame in four - momentum space , with three basic four - vectors @xmath378 orthogonal to the fourth four - vector @xmath38 ( see ( [ 5bisnoe ] ) ) .",
    "in such a way the relativistic spin in any frame is described by the @xmath42 algebra of lorentz - invariant spin projection operators .",
    "consequently , we describe the state with definite values of spin square @xmath379 and invariant spin projection @xmath112 by a lorentz - covariant wave function .    in order to quantize the classical system",
    "we have introduced a complete set of commuting observables , which determine the generalized coordinates of the wavefunction . in our case",
    "the set of commuting generalized coordinates does not contain all the spacetime coordinates , because in our geometric framework they do not commute ( see ( [ x.non-commutative ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", only the lorentz - invariant projection @xmath380 can be included into the quantum - mechanical commuting coordinates .",
    "in such a way we are allowed to use plane waves @xmath381 as describing the spacetime dependence of the wavefunction .",
