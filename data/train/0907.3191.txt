    "rabi oscillations are periodical transitions of a two - level quantum system between its stationary states under the action of an oscillatory driving field , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was theoretically predicted by rabi on nuclear spins in radio - frequency magnetic field @xcite and was firstly observed by torrey @xcite .",
    "afterwards , rabi oscillations were discovered in various physical systems , such as electromagnetically driven atoms@xcite ( including the case of rydberg atomic states @xcite ) , semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite , and different types of solid - state qubits ( superconducting charge qubits based on josephson junctions @xcite , spin - qubits @xcite , semiconductor charge - qubits @xcite ) . in real physical systems the ideal picture @xcite of rabi effect can be essentially modified by additional features , such as the time - domain modulation of the field - matter coupling constant @xcite , the phonon - induced dephasing @xcite and the local - field effects @xcite .",
    "new phenomena appear in rabi oscillators with broken inversion symmetry @xcite and in systems of two coupled rabi oscillators @xcite .    in spatially extensive samples with a large number of oscillators",
    "the propagation effects come into play . as a result ,",
    "the mechanism responsible for rabi oscillations causes also a number of nonstationary coherent optical phenomena , such as optical nutation , photon echo , self - induced transparency , etc @xcite . in low - dimensional systems",
    "the propagation effects also take place . for example , the numerical modeling of the coherent intersubband rabi oscillations in a sample comprising 80 algaas / gaas quantum wells @xcite shows that the population dynamics depends on the quantum well position in the series .",
    "this result demonstrates strong radiative coupling between wells and , more generally , significant difference in the picture of rabi effect for single and multiple oscillators .",
    "another aspects of such a difference , namely , the effects of quantum interference and correlations between photons in multiatom fluorescence , are demonstrated in @xcite ( on the example of atomic chains in nanofibers ) . from practical point of view , the effect of rabi oscillations is a key ingredient for realization of binary logic and optical control in quantum informatics and quantum computing .",
    "the theoretical analysis of rabi oscillations is highly diversified both in form and content .",
    "the common feature is the impossibility of consideration of electromagnetic field influence as a small perturbation .",
    "different ways of description are used in the analysis of the model problem of rabi oscillations in a single two - level atom @xcite .",
    "one such a way , the probability amplitude method , consists in solving of the schrdinger equation for wavefunction @xmath0 , which is the superposition of various atom - photon states .",
    "the second one is the heisenberg operator method which is based on the analysis of the photonic and atomic operators time evolution . and finally , the third way is the unitary time - evolution operator technique .",
    "as is demonstrated in @xcite , all these methods lead to identical solutions ; the choice of the concrete one is determined by the convenience considerations .",
    "taking into account the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field has the special significance in the analysis of rabi oscillations in complex systems .",
    "two different cases can be marked out .",
    "the first could be called quasiclassical one @xcite . in this case external field",
    "has classical nature .",
    "however , the true field is supposed to be concordant with the quantum motions of the particles .",
    "so , the field should contain the contribution of the induced polarization , which has a quantum nature .",
    "another case is really quantum and takes into consideration the photon structure of the electromagnetic field @xcite . during the process of energy - level transitions in the atom the photon structure of the field",
    "is also transformed , therefore the atom - photon dynamics should be considered self - consistently .    in this paper",
    "we build for the first time a theoretical model of a distributed system of coupled rabi oscillators and predict a new physical effect : propagation of rabi oscillations in space in the form of traveling waves and wave packets .",
    "quantum oscillators in the system that exhibit rabi - wave propagation interact strongly enough to stare and exchange the e - h pair excitation between light emission and light absorption acts . often in quantum optics",
    "an `` all - matter '' picture is employed , where the dynamics of electromagnetic field is integrated out , for example in the optical bloch equations @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the light - matter interaction is treated in an `` all - light '' picture ( lippmann - schwinger equation approach ) .    in our model the quantum nature of light",
    "is also fully accounted . as the theoretical approach the _ probability amplitude method _ ,",
    "generalized for the case of 1d - chain , is convenient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : theory ] the model is formulated and equations of electron - photon dynamics both for discrete chain and continuous limit are obtained . in sec.[sec : trav_w ] the plane rabi waves are considered ( their dispersion equations , eigenmode structure , dispersion curves properties ) .",
    "sec.[sec : wave_pack ] is devoted to the rabi wavepackets investigation , their spatial - temporal dynamics is analyzed , experimental observability of rabi waves is discussed . in sec.[sec : class_lim ] the rabi waves in the case of classic light are examined and distinctive features of semiclassical consideration are treated of . in sec.[sec : local_field ] the role of the local - field effects and conditions of this effects negligibility are discussed . in sec.[sec : correlators ] the space - time structure of electron - electron and electron - photon correlators is considered .",
    "the main results of the work are formulated in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",

    "it is assumed that in each @xmath1-th qd there are at least two one - electron orbital states , ground @xmath2 and excited @xmath3 , with transition frequency @xmath4 .",
    "neighboring qds are coupled via electron tunneling @xcite , i.e. the electron can go from state @xmath3 to state @xmath5 and from @xmath2 to state @xmath6 .",
    "transitions between ground state and excited state belonging to different qds are neglected : @xmath7 .",

    "the dependence of the field on transverse coordinates is negligibly small because of electrical smallness of qds .",
    "the case of oblique propagation is of interest due to the possibility of wavenumber variation with variation of incidence angle @xmath8 at constant frequency @xmath16 .",

    "the evolution of the system is described by the nonstationary schrdinger equation @xmath41 , where the interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath42 .",

    "we have taken into account that the interaction can cause the transitions between the states @xmath45 , @xmath46 only .",
    "as it is seen from eqs. , two competitive mechanisms manifest themselves in the light - qd - chain coupling : the local - field induced nonlinearity and the dispersion spreading due to the tunneling .    to this point",
    "we have taken no account of the decay processes inside the qds . to take this processes into account one",
    "should allow for processes of interaction of e - h pair in qd with phonon bath .",
    "such interaction can be described by conception of quantum trajectories @xcite of e - h pair , which are the superpositions of deterministic evolutions and random jumps under the action of lindblad operators . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian should be replaced by the efficient non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is lindblad operator for @xmath1-th qd .",
    "suppose that the density of phonon states of the bath has the form of lorentz line with frequency @xmath4 and width @xmath49 .",
    "if the bath is weakly coupled with qd then @xmath50 ( see refs @xcite ) .",

    "if one of the barriers becomes absolutely opaque , the corresponding pair of subpackets does not move : @xmath192 at @xmath193 . the light propagation _ along the qd - chain _ is another necessary condition of rabi subpackets motion : @xmath192 at @xmath194 .    for more detail analysis of rabi wavepackets dynamics ( in particular for taking into account the diffraction spreading ) the integrals  need to be calculated numerically .",
