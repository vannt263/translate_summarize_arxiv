    "the case of utility on the whole real line has only a few references : @xcite for @xmath10 , @xcite for the _ exponential utility _ with a suitably integrable @xmath4 , and its generalization by @xcite to the case with utility _ bounded from above_.    the central question of this paper is : to what degree of generality does ( [ eq : duality1 ] ) hold true ? under the fundamental assumption that @xmath0 is _ locally bounded _ , we shall prove the duality for a wide class of utility functions @xmath2 on the whole real line and unbounded random endowments @xmath4 . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "a ( standard ) way of showing the duality in robust utility maximization is to reduce the robust problem to a family of _ subjective _ problems with the help of a minimax theorem , i.e. , to interchange the order of `` @xmath13 '' and `` @xmath14 '' in the left hand side of ( [ eq : duality1 ] ) and then apply the duality for each _ fixed _ @xmath6 .",
    "this procedure , however , requires an additional technical assumption that the utility function is bounded from above .    instead , we follow a functional analytic approach in the spirit of @xcite in the subjective case , which appeals to fenchel s general duality theorem with the help of rockafellar s classical result on _ convex integral functionals_. to apply this approach to our robust problem",

    "then we give in section  [ sec : outline ] the heuristics behind the proof of the duality theorem and a key lemma ( lemma  [ lem : key ] ) , which leads us to the study of functionals of the form ( [ eq : robint1intro ] ) .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ sec : pointwise ] , which constitutes the heart of our analysis , giving a rockafellar - type theorem ( theorem  [ thm : pointwise ] ) for this type of functionals .",
