    "a muon collider is particularly well suited to the threshold measurement because the spread in energy of the beam is very small@xcite .",
    "pair production of @xmath0-bosons , @xmath1 production and the bjorken process @xmath2 have been considered as possible places to study thresholds at a muon collider@xcite .",
    "threshold production of chargino pairs at a muon collider offers a possible way of accurately measuring the chargino mass@xcite .",
    "we assume here that the muon collider has a relatively modest beam energy spread of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rms spread of the energy of a muon beam .",
    "we assume that 100  fb@xmath5 integrated luminosity is available and that this amount of luminosity could be accumulated at the relevant energies for the measuring the threshold cross sections ; high luminosity is essential if the threshold measurements are to prove interesting .",
    "the threshold cross section is most sensitive to @xmath8 just above @xmath9 , but a tradeoff exists between maximizing the signal rate and the sensitivity of the cross section to @xmath8 .",
    "detailed analysis @xcite shows that if the background level is small and systematic uncertainties in efficiencies are not important , then the optimal measurement of @xmath8 is obtained by collecting data at a single energy @xmath10 where the threshold cross section is sharply rising .    at a muon collider with high luminosity , systematic errors arising from uncertainties in the background level and the detection /",
    "triggering efficiencies will be dominant unless some of the luminosity is devoted to measuring the level of the background ( which automatically includes somewhat similar efficiencies ) at an energy below the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "then , assuming that efficiencies for the background and @xmath12 signal are sufficiently well understood that systematic uncertainties effectively cancel in the ratio of the above - threshold to the below - threshold rates , a very accurate @xmath8 determination becomes possible .",
    "we analyzed@xcite the possible precision obtainable for the @xmath0 mass via just two measurements : one at center of mass energy @xmath13 , just above threshold , and one at @xmath14 .",
    "the optimal @xmath6 measurement is obtained by expending about two - thirds of the luminosity at @xmath13 and one - third at @xmath14 .",
    "combining the three modes , an overall precision of @xmath15 should be achievable with 100  fb@xmath5 integrated luminosity .",
    "the sm higgs boson is easily discovered in the bjorken higgs - strahlung process  @xcite @xmath17 running the machine well above threshold ,  at @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "the dominant higgs boson decay is to @xmath20 and most backgrounds can be eliminated by @xmath21-tagging . a very accurate determination of @xmath22 could then obtained by measuring the threshold cross section of @xmath23 production , which rises rapidly as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) since the threshold behavior is @xmath24-wave .",
    "= 2.50 in = 2.50 in    the sensitivity to the sm higgs boson mass is maximized by a single measurement of the cross section at @xmath25  gev , just above the real particle threshold provided that the normalization of the measured @xmath23 cross section as a function of @xmath26 can be precisely predicted , including efficiencies and systematic effects .",
    "we employed @xmath21-tagging and cuts in order to reduce the background to a very low level .",
    "these cuts and other systematic uncertainties are discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "the background is very much smaller than the signal unless @xmath22 is close to @xmath27 .",
    "the electroweak radiative corrections to the cross section are estimated to be less than 1% for @xmath28  gev@xcite , and the measurement of the cross section described here is at the 2% level .",
    "we found a precision of the sm higgs mass determination to within 45for @xmath29 may be achievable at a muon collider .",
    "more generally the precision ranges from 20 - 100  mev for @xmath30  gev .    beyond the standard model the cross section generally depends on the @xmath31 coupling ( @xmath32 ) and the total higgs width ( @xmath33 ) in addition to @xmath22 .",
    "in order to simultaneously determine these three quantities , measurements could be made at the three c.m .",
    "energies @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . with a three - parameter fit to @xmath22 , @xmath37 and @xmath33 , the attainable error in @xmath22 is about @xmath38 at the @xmath39 level for a 100  gev higgs .",
    "measurements that would simultaneously determine @xmath22 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 could be done at a level of accuracy that could distinguish a standard model higgs boson from its many possible (  supersymmetric ) extensions@xcite .",
    "the top - quark threshold cross section is calculable since the large top - quark mass puts one in the perturbative regime of qcd@xcite .",
    "one can perform scan of the threshold curve by devoting to 10  fb@xmath5 integrated luminosity to measuring the cross section at each of ten energies in 1  gev intervals .",
    "then the top - quark mass can be determined to within @xmath43 , provided systematics and theoretical uncertainties are under control .",
    "considerable progress has been made recently in the theoretical calculations of the some nnlo corrections to the threshold cross section@xcite .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainties@xcite in the threshold cross section are still fairly large and make it difficult to fully exploit the large luminosity for determining say the strong coupling @xmath44 or a light higgs boson mass ( and the top quark yukawa coupling ) from the size of the cross section .",
    "furthermore there is theoretical ambiguity in the mass definition of the top quark .",
    "the theoretical ambiguity in relating quark pole mass to other definitions of the top quark mass ( that might be relevant as input to radiative correction calculations ) is of order @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ , or a few hundred mev @xcite .",
    "so it is not clear that an extraction of the top - quark mass better than this is useful , at least at the present time .",
    "the mass of the lighter chargino in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can be determined accurately by measuring the cross section for @xmath46 near the threshold@xcite .",
    "the precision that can be obtained in the chargino mass depends substantially on the mass of the chargino mass itself : the heavier the chargino the smaller the production cross section .",
    "the cross section also depends on the mass of the sneutrino which appears in the @xmath47-channel since this contribution interferes destructively with the @xmath48-channel graphs .",
    "the cross section is displayed in fig .",
    "1(b ) for several values of the sneutrino mass .",
    "if the lightest chargino is gaugino - dominated , then changing the parameters of the chargino mass matrix essentially changes the mass but not the chargino couplings significantly .",
    "the width of the lightest chargino is usually less than a few mev , and often substantially less when two - body decays are kinematically impossible .",
    "therefore one can envision a measurement of the cross section that depends on just two parameters : the chargino mass @xmath49 and the sneutrino mass @xmath50 .    as in the other threshold measurements , the statistical precision on the chargino mass is maximized just above @xmath51 .",
    "a simultaneous measurement of the chargino and sneutrino masses requires a sampling of the cross section at at least two points .",
    "it turns out to be advantageous for the chargino mass measurement to choose this higher energy measurement at a point where the chargino cross section is not flat .",
    "the chargino decay mode is @xmath52 provided the chargino is lighter than the muon sneutrino .",
    "the cross section is reduced near threshold , so the cuts to reduce backgrounds need to be reoptimized .",
    "the backgrounds to chargino pair - production have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite where the signal efficiencies have been obtained for the various final states when the center - of - mass energy is @xmath53  gev .",
    "the primary background is @xmath0 pair production which is very large , but can be effectively eliminated because the @xmath0 s are produced in the very - forward direction .",
    "however , if the energy is reduced so that the collider is operating in the chargino threshold region , then the effectiveness of these cuts might be reduced ( the signal events might be expected to be more spherical as well ) .",
    "therefore the efficiencies were reinvestigated for the threshold measurement .",
    "a further advantage of the threshold measurement is that the chargino mass measurement is somewhat isolated from its subsequent decays .",
    "distributions in the final state observables , say e.g. @xmath54 from the decay @xmath55@xcite , depend on the neutralino mass .",
    "the cross section for chargino pair production , on the other hand , is independent of the final state particles , and only the branching fractions and detector efficiencies for the various final states impact this measurement ( as indicated above , if @xmath56 the branching fractions of chargino decay is given essentially in terms of the @xmath0 branching fractions ) .",
    "the chargino production cross section decreases with increasing chargino mass .",
    "therefore the precision with which the mass can be measured is better at smaller values of the mass with precisions of as small as 30  mev possible for @xmath57  gev . for @xmath58  gev the chargino mass",
    "can be determined to 100 ( 200 )  mev for @xmath59 ( 300 )  gev .",
    "the sneutrino mass can be measured to about 6  gev accuracy for @xmath60  gev and to about 20  gev accuracy for @xmath61  gev .",
    "this provides an indirect method of measuring the sneutrino mass ( the sneutrino might be too heavy to produce directly ) .",
    "a muon collider would provide an opportunity for precision mass measurements in the respective threshold regions@xcite while the nlc design expects a beam energy spread of @xmath62 . a high energy @xmath63 collider in the large vlhc tunnel",
    "would have a beam spread of @xmath64  gev@xcite which should give numbers precisions comparable to those considered here . ] .",
    "the precisions that can be obtained for particle masses is shown in table  1 assuming an integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath65 .",
    "the precisions for the higgs and chargino measurements are correlated with the ( as of yet unknown ) mass , so the ranges we considered are shown as well . to utilize the highest precision measurements achievable at the statistical level , theoretical uncertainties and other systematics need to be under control in all cases .",
    "the muon sneutrino mass can also be simultaneously measured to a few gev if it is less than 500  gev in the process @xmath66 .",
