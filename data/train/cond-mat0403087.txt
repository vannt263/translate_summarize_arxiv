    "the application of high magnetic fields is a very powerful tool for studying the electronic properties of a large variety of metals , semiconductors and superconductors . due to the landau quantization of electron motion in sufficiently strong magnetic field ,",

    "the landau quantization is most spectacularly manifest in the electronic magneto - transport in low dimensional conductors .",
    "striking examples are the celebrated quantum hall effects ( qhe ) @xcite .",
    "apart from the anomalous enhancement of the well known qo in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) one expects also strong qo in physical properties which are not sensitive to the magnetic field in isotropic three dimensional metals .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that in quasi - two - dimensional metals under strong magnetic fields the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath0 should exhibit strong magnetic oscillations .",
    "this should be compared with the korringa relaxation law @xcite usually observed in three - dimensional normal metals , which results in a magnetic field independent nuclear spin - relaxation rate .",
    "this line of research seems to be useful in dense quasi - two - dimensional electronic systems , as is the case of synthetic metals ( gic s etc . ) and low - dimensional organic compounds .    a completely new line of research , the hyperfine interaction between nuclear and electron spins in low dimensional and correlated electron systems , has been developed during the two last decades both theoretically [ 8  -  39 ] , and experimentally [ 40 - 59 ] .",

    "very recently nuclear spin memory devices @xcite and the indirect hyperfine interaction  via electrons between nuclear spin qubits in semiconductor based quantum computer proposals [ 33  -  39 ] attracts sharply growing attention .    here",
    "i will outline the main theoretical concepts and some experimental achievements in the new and quickly developing field of * nuclear spintronics*.",
    "in metals and doped semiconductors , usually , the leading contribution to the spin - lattice relaxation process is due to the _ hyperfine fermi contact _ interaction between the nuclear spins and the conduction electron spins @xcite .",
    "this interaction is represented by the hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath3 is the nuclear spin and @xmath4 is the magnetic field on the nuclear site , produced by electron orbital and spin magnetic moments : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the electron radius - vector , @xmath7 is the electron spin operator , @xmath8 is the bohr magneton and @xmath9 is the electronic @xmath9-factor .    the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath10 , caused by the hyperfine fermi contact interaction between the nuclear spins and the conduction electron spins , is related to the local spin - spin correlation function through the equation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the transverse components of the electron spin density operator at the nuclear position * r * , and @xmath14 is the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency .",
    "the rate of the nuclear spin - relaxation in metals is , usually , proportional to the temperature and to the square of the electronic density of states at the fermi energy ( the korringa law @xcite ) .",
    "this follows from the following expression : @xmath15\\delta ( e_{f}-e_{i}+\\gamma _ { n}h_{0}).\\ ] ]    at low temperatures : @xmath16\\propto k_{b}t$ ] @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the temperature in the energy units , we arrive at the linear in temperature dependence of  @xmath19 @xmath20 which is the well known korringa law @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is the electron density of states at the fermi level .      in high magnetic fields and in systems with reduced dimensionality this simple argumentation does not hold , since the electron spectrum acquires field induced @xcite or size quantized @xcite energy gaps .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite and confirmed experimentally , see e.g. @xcite , that in qhe systems the nuclear spin relaxation rate should have an activation behavior @xmath22 where @xmath23 is either @xmath24 , the electron zeeman gap ( odd filling factors ) or @xmath25 , the landau levels gap ( even filling factors ) , instead of the usual korringa law .",
    "the discreteness of the electron spectrum manifests , at finite temperatures , in an activation type of the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate , @xmath26as it seen from eq .",
    "( [ t1exp ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of the magnetoresistance @xmath27 in the qhe , @xcite , see fig .  2 .",
    ".,width=480 ]      this unusual magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation reflects the fact that the energy gaps in the spectrum of two - dimensional electrons in strong magnetic fields ( either zeeman splitting or the landau levels gap ) are three orders of magnitude larger than the nuclear zeeman energy .",
    "indeed , the energy needed to reverse the spin of an electron in the external magnetic field @xmath28 is @xmath29 , which is much larger ( by a factor of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the nuclear and free electron masses ) than the energy @xmath33 provided by reversing the nuclear spin .",
    "therefore the delta function in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can not be realized and the simultaneous spin flip of the nuclear and the electron spins ( flip - flop ) in landau levels , fig .",
    "3 , is severely restricted by the energy conservation .        on the other hand , in isotropic @xmath34 electron systems , in a strong magnetic field : @xmath35 , the kinetic energy of the electron motion parallel to the field should change in order to ensure the energy conservation of the process shown in fig .  4 .",
    "thus , in the  isotropic ",
    "@xmath34 model , the electron spin - flip will be accompanied by a simultaneous change of the landau level and of the kinetic energy parallel to the field , e@xmath36 according to @xmath37    while this is impossible for an ideal @xmath38 system in a strong magnetic field , it may take place in quasi - two - dimensional conductors , as is the case in superlattices , for certain regions of parameters .",
    "electron systems.,width=437 ]    because of the existence of energy gaps in the electron spectrum of a 2des under strong magnetic fields ( the qhe systems ) , finite nuclear spin relaxation times @xmath39 could be expected only if 2des is subjected to different kinds of external potentials .",
    "broadened landau levels may overlap , thus providing a nonzero density of states of both spin projections at the fermi energy .",
    "this will result in finite relaxation time for excited nuclear spins interacting with the conduction electrons on the landau levels .",
    "description of these processes , performed in the framework of the finite temperature matzubara diagram techniques , is presented in @xcite .",
    "an important question in the quantum hall effect theory is the role of the edge states : electronic orbits magnetically confined to the sample boundary . while the number of edge states may be small compared to the  bulk  states , their contribution to @xmath39 can be very important , since they possess a homogeneous energy spectrum @xcite .    in sufficiently clean heterojunctions , however , where the fractional qhe ( fqhe ) and wigner crystallization could be observed , the mechanisms mentioned above are extremely inefficient .      at finite temperatures the energy conservation in the flip - flop process",
    "can be fulfilled by absorbing a phonon [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "the mechanism , considered in @xcite , consists of two processes in which , first , electron and nuclear spins are simultaneously reversed by the hyperfine interaction , and , second , only electron spins are reversed by their coupling to the lattice strain . in these processes , a phonon is either absorbed or emitted to satisfy the energy conservation law .",
    "both the zeeman split - level energy ( @xmath40 ) and chemical potential ( @xmath41 ) depend on a magnetic field .",
    "the dominant contribution to nuclear relaxation comes from the transition between two spin - split levels that are near the chemical potential .",
    "the contributions from other landau levels that are far away from the chemical potential are proportional to @xmath42 $ ] and are negligible under the qhe condition .",
    "the value at a minimum depend strongly on the value of exchange interaction .    at low temperatures ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the nuclear spin relaxation rate varies exponentially with inverse temperature ( i.e. , @xmath44 $ ] ) because the number of thermally excited phonons in the reservoir becomes exponentially small as the temperature is decreased . at higher temperatures ( @xmath45 ) , on the other hand ,",
    "the relaxation rate varies linearly with temperature ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) .",
    "nucleus - mediated spin - flip transitions in gaas quantum dots have been studied in @xcite . in these papers the electron spin relaxation times were calculated taking into account the mechanism , where the phonons provide the necessary energy and nuclear spins take care for the spin conservation during the electron transition between zeeman split states in quantum dots .",
    "the nuclear spin relaxation in 2deg , associated with the dipole - dipole interaction between the nuclear and the electronic spins was studied by ovchinnikov et al .",
    "the principle physical difference between these two mechanisms is that while in the contact interaction the total spin should be conserved and an electron has to flip its spin in order to relax the nuclear spin , the conserved quantity in the dipole - dipole interaction is the total ( spin plus orbital ) momentum .",
    "therefore an electron can relax a nuclear spin without changing its own spin state , just by shifting its center of orbit .",
    "this mechanism should be prevailing in clean samples , i.e. under the fqhe conditions .",
    "much of the recent attention paid to hyperfine interactions under conditions of the quantum hall effect is connected with correlation effects in 2des .",
    "this is based on the notion of a spin - exciton : the elementary excitation over the zeeman gap dressed by the coulomb interaction @xcite.this results in a strong enhancement ( up to a factor of 100 , as is the case in gaas ) of the effective @xmath47 -factor .",
    "spin exciton and skyrmion dispersion : the energy gap of large momentum excitons is two times larger than the skyrmion s one . in the insets the @xmath38 electron spin arrangements for spin excitons ( left ) and skyrmions ( right ) is shown.,width=443 ]    due to the coulomb interaction the spin - excitons are bound states of electron - hole pairs which , unlike the individual electrons or holes , can propagate freely under the influence of a magnetic field due to their zero electric charge .",
    "these elementary excitations are , therefore , chargeless particles with a nearly parabolic dispersion in the low - k limit . at @xmath48",
    "the gap is equal to the  bare ",
    "zeeman splitting .    the energy spectrum of spin - excitons on the ground landau level : n=0 is @xcite : @xmath49{\\frac{e^{2}}{\\kappa a_{h } } } .",
    "\\label{espex0}\\ ] ]    in the parabolic approximation ( small exciton momenta ) , the dispersion relation reads : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the definition of the spin - exciton mass .",
    "the invariance of the energy gap with respect to the electron- electron interaction is associated with the fact that in creating a quasielectron - quasihole pair excitation at the same point in space ( i.e. with center of mass momentum @xmath48 ) the energy decrease due to the coulomb attraction is exactly cancelled by the increase in the exchange energy .",
    "thus the energy gap for the creation of a widely separated ( i.e. with @xmath52 ) quasielectron - quasihole pair ( large spin - exciton ) is equal to the exchange energy associated with the hole .",
    "external potentials , like long range potential fluctuations , periodically modulated heterostructures etc .",
    ", may reduce substantiality the spin - exciton gap .      in @xcite",
    "the spin - exciton in a periodically modulated two - dimensional electron gas under strong magnetic fields was investigated .",
    "it was shown there that a periodic external potential , with a period in the submicron range , can remove the energy gap in the spin - exciton dispersion at certain values of the spin - exciton momenta .",
    "this may result in several interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , the rate of nuclear spin relaxation and depolarization processes in heterojunctions will be strongly enhanced .",
    "it is easy to see why the zeeman energy gap can be removed by the modulation potential in an ideal model of noninteracting electrons : consider a noninteracting electron - hole pair with opposite spins , which are subject to an external magnetic field and a periodic potential with amplitude @xmath53 and period @xmath54 by appropriately selecting the spatial separation between the electron and the hole along the modulation direction the energy difference between them can be reduced to zero .",
    "the minimal amplitude @xmath53 required to satisfy this condition is @xmath55 , the spatial separation between the electron and the hole involved is half of the modulation period @xmath56,and the corresponding wave number ( along the y - direction ) is @xmath57 . the picture is significantly more complicated , however , in the presence of the strong coulomb interaction , where bound spin - excitons exist .",
    "maniv et al .",
    "@xcite , have considered the effect of vacuum quantum fluctuations in the qh ferromagnetic state on the decoherence of nuclear spins .",
    "it was shown there that the virtual excitations of spin excitons , which have a large energy gap ( on the scale of the nuclear zeeman energy ) above the ferromagnetic ground state energy , lead to fast incomplete decoherence in the nuclear spin system .",
    "it is found that a system of many nuclear spins , coupled to the electronic spins in the @xmath38 electron gas through the fermi contact hyperfine interaction , partially loses its phase coherence during the short ( electronic ) time @xmath58 , even under the ideal conditions of the qhe , where both @xmath39 , and @xmath59 are infinitely long .",
    "the effect arises as a result of vacuum quantum fluctuations associated with virtual excitations of spin waves ( or spin excitons ) by the nuclear spins .",
    "the incompleteness of the resulting decoherence is due to the large energy gap of these excitations whereas the extreme weakness of the hyperfine interaction with the @xmath38 electron gas guarantees that the loss of coherence of a single nuclear spin is extremely small .",
    "the manipulation of the nuclear spins is carried out through spin flip - flop processes , associated with the transverse part of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62  are the transverse components of the nuclear spin operators , and @xmath63 are the corresponding components of the electron spin density operators .",
    "here @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the electron field operators with spin projections @xmath66 .",
    "the longitudinal part of @xmath60 , @xmath67 , which commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath68 , and so leaves the nuclear spin projections along @xmath69 unchanged , can still erode quantum coherence in the nuclear spin system @xcite .    to simplify the analysis it is assumed that the nuclei under study have spin @xmath70 , and",
    "so the corresponding spin operators are expressed in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath71 , as @xmath72 in this case the transverse components @xmath73 , @xmath74 , are up to a proportionality constant , just the off diagonal elements ( or coherences ) of the density matrix of a single nuclear spin ( qubit ) @xcite .    the decay of these elements with time , which determines the rate of decoherence of a single qubit , can be thus found from the equations of motion for the operators @xmath71 in the heisenberg representation @xmath75    considering a single nuclear spin and evaluating its rate of decoherence due to the coupling with a bath of spin excitons , assuming that initially , at time @xmath76 , the electronic system is in its ground ( qh ferromagnetic ) state @xmath77 that the time dependence of the coherence @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80.$ ] this result is similar to the expression found by palma et al .",
    "@xcite in an artificial model of pure decoherence , i.e. when energy transfer between the qubit and its environment is not allowed .",
    "the remarkable feature of this expression is due to the presence of the energy gap @xmath81 in the spin exciton spectrum , which is typically much larger than the nuclear zeeman energy @xmath82 . during a short time scale , of the order of @xmath58 ,",
    "the coherence @xmath83 of a single nuclear spin diminishes and then saturates for a very long time ( i.e. of the order of the relaxation time @xmath59 ) at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 ^{2}}% \\sim 1.\\ ] ] for @xmath86 heterostructure the coupling constant @xmath87 is typically of the order of @xmath88  @xcite .",

    "theoretical calculation of the nuclear - spin dephasing / decoherence time scale @xmath59 for in qhe systems with impurities was presented in @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interaction between the electron and the nuclear spins , @xmath107 , can be split into two parts @xmath108 where @xmath109 corresponds to the coupling of the electrons to the diagonal part of nuclear spin operator @xmath110 , and @xmath111  to its off - diagonal part .",
    "it follows @xcite , that @xmath112 can be incorporated into the nuclear - spin energy splitting , redefining the hamiltonian of the nuclear spin as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "the relevant terms in the full hamiltonian can be expressed solely in terms of the nuclear - spin operators and spin - excitation operators @xcite .",
    "it is assumed there that initially , at time @xmath76 , the nuclear spin is polarized , while the excitons are in the ground state , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the ground state of spin - excitons .",
    "since the hamiltonian conserves the total number of elementary excitations in the system , the most general wave function can be written as @xmath117 corresponding to the nuclear spin in the ground state and @xmath118 describing the single - exciton state with the wave vector @xmath119 .",

    "it is obvious that due to the large gap in the spin - exciton spectrum , @xmath127 , the energy conservation in the flip - flop process can not be satisfied , and so in the absence of interaction with impurities , @xmath128 .",
    "interactions with impurities will modify these solution , and , as a consequence , the energy conservation condition .",
    "in particular , if the impurity potential is strong enough , it can provide additional energy to spin - excitons , so that their energy can fluctuate on the scale of order @xmath129 thus making nuclear - spin relaxation possible .",
    "this mechanism was identified in @xcite , and it corresponds to large fluctuations of the impurity potential @xmath130 , which usually occur with a rather small probability , so @xmath39 is very large for such systems .",
    "the perturbative solution does not describe the energy relaxation ( @xmath39 ) , but it does yield the phase shift due to the impurity potential .",
    "this phase shift , when averaged over configurations of the impurity potential , produces a finite dephasing time , @xmath59,which can be calculated considering the reduced density matrix of the nuclear spin , given by @xmath131_{u}.   \\label{eq26moz}\\ ] ]    here the trace is partial , taken over the states of the spin - excitons , while the outer brackets denote averaging over the impurity potential .",
    "the trace over the spin - excitons can be carried out straightforwardly because within the leading - order perturbative approximation used here they remain in the ground state ; all excitations are virtual and contribute only to the phase shift .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath132 are not influenced by virtual excitations and remain constant .",

    "it is the averaging of these quantities over the white - noise impurity potential @xmath130 that yields dephasing of the nuclear spin .",
    "this averaging can be done by utilizing the relation @xmath135 _ { u}=\\exp [ -{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left ( [ \\phi ] _ { u}\\right ) ^{2 } ] $ ] .      apart from the direct nuclear spin relaxation , important information about the electron system can be obtained from nuclear spin diffusion processes .",
    "this is the case when the nuclear spins are polarized in a small part of a sample as it was experimentally observed in @xcite .    to explain these experimental observations , bychkov et al",
    "@xcite have suggested a new mechanism for indirect nuclear spin coupling via the exchange of spin excitons .",
    "the spin diffusion rate from a given nuclear site @xmath136 within the polarized region is proportional to the rate of transition probability p(@xmath136 ) for the polarization of the nuclear spin @xmath137 , located at @xmath136 , to be transferred to a nuclear spin @xmath138 , positioned at @xmath139 , outside the polarized region , via the exchange of virtual spin excitons , fig .",
    "the virtual character of the spin - excitons , transferring the nuclear spin polarization , removes the problem of the energy conservation , typical for a single flip - flop process .",
    "furthermore , the virtual spin - excitons are neutral entities , which can propagate freely in the presence of a magnetic field . in this model the electron interactions play a crucial role : the kinetic energy of a spin exciton is due to the coulomb attraction between the electron and the hole",
    ". thus the proposed mechanism yields the possibility of transferring nuclear spin polarization over a distance much longer than the magnetic length @xmath140 .",
    "the long range nature of this mechanism is of considerable importance when the size of the region of excited nuclear spins , @xmath141 , is much larger than the magnetic length @xmath142 .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , the potential of the nuclear spin - spin interaction , mediated by the exchange of spin - excitons , is a monotonic function of the distance between the two nuclei with the asymptotics : @xmath143 where @xmath144 this is typical for the interaction , mediated by the exchange of quasiparticles with an energy gap at @xmath145 , as is the case for the spin - exciton dispersion .",
    "the range @xmath146 of this potential is determined by the critical wave number @xmath147 as it follows from the uncertainty principle : @xmath148 .",
    "the negative sign of this interaction corresponds to attraction between the nuclear spins and may cause , at sufficiently low temperatures , a ferromagnetically ordered nuclear state in qhe systems .",
    "spin - excitons constitute the building blocks , from which more complex spin textures can be formed .",
    "for example , at finite densities the spin excitons condense  @xcite into skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs .",
    "these unusual topological excitations @xcite in the spin distribution of real 2des were observed , in nmr experiments , near filling factor @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "further evidences for skyrmions in 2des were found in transport and optical experiments .",
    "skyrmions , in qhe systems , are the topologically nontrivial spin excitations around filling factor @xmath149 @xcite which arise as a condensate of interacting spin excitons @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction acts to enlarge the skyrmion size while the zeeman splitting tends to collapse skyrmions .",
    "the interplay between these factors determines the final distribution of spins within a skyrmion , and its characteristic length scales .",
    "the resulting radius @xmath150 corresponds to the region where both these energies are of the same value , and grows weakly to infinity as the g - factor goes to zero @xcite , thus reflecting the importance of the long range coulomb repulsion associated with the skyrmion charge in the zero g - factor limit .",
    "a canonical @xmath151 transformation from the fully polarized ground state , where all spins are oriented along a single axis , to a state , consisting of a macroscopic number of differently oriented spins , each of which is slightly rotated with respect to its nearest neighbors in space was is developed in @xcite .",
    "it is found also that contrary to the lowest landau level , these energies are positive for both skyrmions and antiskyrmions .    it should be noted that the spin - rotation transformation employed in @xcite is unitary and does not change the total number of electrons .",
    "thus by going to the new state @xmath152 from the fully polarized ground state @xmath153 , is exactly equal to half the total energy required to create a well separated electron - hole pair ( large spin exciton ) .",
    "if the zeeman splitting is not neglected , however , the increase in magnetic energy associated with the rotated spins determines a length scale for the spatial size of the defect . to take into account zeeman spin splitting the hartree - fock ( hf ) energy functional",
    "should be corrected by the additive term @xmath154 @xcite , where @xmath155 is the zeeman splitting energy .",

    "the nuclear spins are strongly polarized .",
    "the sample inhomogeneity may result in a strong inhomogeneity of the hyperfine field , fig .  8 , and therefore spatially varying electron zeeman splitting .",
    "this may result in a strong localization of skyrmions @xcite , resulting in the combined topologically nontrivial electron - nuclear spin excitation , the skyr - nuon , fig .",
    "as we have seen in previous sections , the nuclear spin polarization , once created , remains finite for macroscopically long times @xcite .",
    "intensive experimental studies @xcite of this phenomenon have provided a more detailed knowledge on the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and electron spins in heterojunctions and quantum wells .",
    "it was observed that the nuclear spin relaxation time is rather long ( up to 10@xmath163 ) and the hyperfine field acting on the charge carriers spins is extremely high , up to 10@xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial physics in this subject is based on a fact that the discrete nature of the electron spectrum in these systems will result in exponentially long dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation times @xmath39 on the system parameters @xcite , i.e. t@xmath165 @xmath166 ( here @xmath167 is the electron energy level spacing and @xmath168 is the temperature ) .",
    "we assume here that similar law should take place also in the nanostructures with well defined size quantization of the electron spectrum .",
    "note that in this case @xmath39 is very sensitive to the potential fluctuations , caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of impurities in a heterojunction @xcite .",
    "a family of new physical effects in nanostructures with strong spin - orbital coupling appears when the electron spin degeneracy is lifted by a hyperfine field of polarized nuclei .",
    "indeed , the combined action of a strong nuclear polarization and the spin - orbit interaction , breaks the time reversal symmetry in a mesoscopic system .",
    "a good illustration for such * meso - nucleo - spinic * effects is the hyperfine aharonov - bohm effect ( habe ) in mesoscopic rings @xcite , caused by hyperfine interaction , as is explained in what follows .",
    "persistent currents ( pc ) in mesoscopic rings reflect the broken clock wise - anticlock wise symmetry of charge carriers momenta caused , usually , by the external vector potential .",
    "experimentally pcs are observed when an adiabatically slow time dependent external magnetic field is applied along the ring axis .",
    "the magnetic field variation results in the oscillatory , with the magnetic flux quantum @xmath169 ( or its harmonics ) period behavior of the diamagnetic moment ( the pc ) , which is the manifestation of the usual aharonov - bohm effect ( abe ) .",

    "it was proposed to use the inhomogeneous hyperfine field to create so - called nuclear spin polarization induced ( nspi ) magnetic structures , such as magnetic quantum dots , wires , rings , superlattices etc .",
    "the spin splitting ( @xmath197 ) due to a hyperfine magnetic field can be comparable to the fermi energy of 2deg , so that the electrons in the region , where nuclear spins are polarized , will occupy the energetically more favorable states with the spins opposite to @xmath198 .",

    "apart of the usual hall effect , caused by the drift of electrons in the crossed electric and magnetic fields , there exist also another contribution to the nondiagonal components of the conductivity tensor , the anomalous hall effect @xcite ( ahe ) , which is caused , in nonmagnetic semiconductors , by the spin - orbit interaction combined with the carrier magnetization .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that in the strong nuclear spin polarization limit and at low magnetic field this effect may give a leading contribution to the anomalous hall effect . due to this interaction ,",

    "it is outlined in @xcite that the hahe _ _  _ _ gives the possibility to observe genuine spin dependent anomalous hall effect which relies on the natural relaxation of nuclear spins and facilitates the experiment since the anomalous hall voltage is not hidden by the much larger ordinary hall effect .",

    "additional support for this mechanism is in the results of @xcite , where the disappearance of the nuclear spin contribution to the heat capacity was reported , as the ratio between the zeeman and coulomb energies exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the zeeman splitting of electrons was modified in these experiments by tilting the magnetic field .",
    "a new very promising technique for measuring spatially varying nuclear spin polarization within a gaas sample is reported in @xcite . in the force detected nmr ( fdnmr ) the sample",
    "is mounted on a microcantilever in an applied magnetic field .",
    "a nearby magnetic particle creates a gradient of magnetic field which exerts a force on the magnetized sample and triggers the cantilever oscillations .",
    "fdnmr is capable to perform the magnetic resonance imaging of the sample with a very high accuracy .",
    "this method can be useful in defining the spatial distribution of nuclear spin polarization in non homogeneous samples .",
    "this information may be crucial for understanding different peculiarities of data obtained by previously described methods .",
    "a new world of the low - temperature physics of the hyperfine interactions in superconducting metals opens in the @xmath328 region , where the nuclear spins start ordering , thus reducing the critical magnetic field of superconductors as has been recently discovered by the pobell group @xcite .",
    "they have studied the magnetic critical field @xmath329 of a metallic compound @xmath330 where the superconductivity sets up at @xmath331  they have observed , in @xmath332 , the nuclear spin ferromagnetic ordering at @xmath333 it was observed in these experiments that the magnetic critical field @xmath334 g is lowered by almost a factor of two at @xmath335",
