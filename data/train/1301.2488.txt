    "we consider it normalized to @xmath21 and replace the water pressure in by the capillary pressure function @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the capillary pressure @xmath23 has to be seen as a multivalued graph with @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the residual saturation , meaning the saturation level below which no flow of water occurs , to be zero , such that @xmath27 is defined on @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "this is necessary for the definition of the infiltration boundary conditions .",
    "additionally , we suppose @xmath29 , which is essential for the limiting process on the outflow boundary .",

    "it can be seen that the coefficient functions degenerate in the sense that @xmath31 and that @xmath16 and @xmath23 may have slopes that are unbounded in the neighbourhood of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "these degeneracies of the coefficient functions are one of the major challenges when treating analytically .",

    "a possible model for the flux @xmath48 on @xmath41 is to consider it as a vertical leakage through a very small semipervious layer of thickness @xmath49 and hydraulic conductivity @xmath50",

    "@xcite picks up the methods used in @xcite and proves the existence of solutions for by regularization techniques , with a stronger solution concept than in @xcite .",
    "the vital improvement is that @xcite allows dry regions , meaning regions where the saturation lies below the ( positive ) residual saturation , on the outflow boundary .",
    "hence , one has to modify the boundary conditions , as the pressure is not defined in dry regions . in @xcite robin boundary conditions",
    "are used in the regularized problem and convergence to the limit on the outflow boundary is obtained via defect measures . without considering outflow conditions , @xcite also studies dry regions and proves the continuity of the free boundaries between the saturated and unsaturated regions and between the unsaturated and dry regions .",
    "in @xcite uniqueness of the solution is proved for the problem introduced in @xcite by adapting the methods developed in  @xcite . in order to show @xmath65-contraction and with this the uniqueness of the solution",

    "for an overview we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.2 ) and @xcite and the literature cited therein .",
    "the richards equation has been discretized using finite volume methods @xcite , mixed finite element methods  @xcite , finite elements @xcite , and discontinuous galerkin schemes  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the resulting algebraic systems were solved using newton s method , which , however , suffers from ill - conditioning problems due to the degeneracies in the parameter functions ( fig .",
    "[ pc_k_shape ] ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite discretize the kirchhoff - transformed richards equation in a way that the resulting spatial problems can be solved efficiently using a monotone multigrid method . since this approach is based on convexity rather than on smoothness , it is also well - suited for non - smooth signorini - type boundary conditions .",
    "numerical studies in @xcite demonstrate the efficiency of the solver , as well as robustness for extreme soil parameters which correspond to parameter functions that degenerate into step functions .",
    "an extension of this approach to heterogeneous soil using domain decomposition techniques can be found in  @xcite . concerning the numerical coupling of richards equation with surface water , we mention @xcite , where shallow water equations are used as the surface water model .",
    "although different discretizations are applied , all these approaches enforce continuity of pressure and normal flux , i.e. , mass conservation , across the interface .",
    "these coupling conditions have also been considered in an approach based on the kirchhoff transformed subsurface flow in  @xcite and  @xcite , where an implicit time discretization of the coupled subsurface and surface water models has been solved with a heterogeneous domain decomposition method . in @xcite , however , the pressure continuity was replaced by a leakage condition such as that represented clogging of a nearly impermeable river bed .",
    "accordingly , a robin  neumann type iteration was applied in  @xcite , whereas in  @xcite a dirichlet  neumann type iteration was used to solve the coupled system . in the present article ,",
    "we choose an explicit time discretization for the surface water as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.4.3 ) .",
    "let us now give an outline of the article .",
    "in the first part of this article we prove a new existence result for the richards equation   endowed with nonlinear outflow conditions of signorini s type   and coupled to surface water by nonlinear robin conditions ( [ ode1 ] , [ q_inflow ] ) .",
    "the proof is done without requiring the assumption @xmath67 . to achieve this goal , in section  [ system_ass ]",
    "we introduce a global pressure  @xmath68 with the help of the kirchhoff transformation and reformulate the system accordingly . in section  [ sec :",
    "existence ] , we state the main existence theorem and derive its proof by combining two central approaches for existence and uniqueness results for nonlinear , degenerated parabolic pdes , namely the regularization technique ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the method of @xmath65-contraction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in the second part of the article , starting with section  [ discreteconvex ] , we present our discretization of the coupled nonlinear problem that is implicit  explicit in time and uses finite elements in space . via variational inequalities",
    ", the implicit  explicit time discretization leads to spatial convex minimization problems which contain nonlinear outflow and nonlinear physical robin boundary conditions but no dirichlet conditions .",
    "we prove unique solvability of these problems if the relative permeability is non - degenerate ( e.g. , regularized ) and the water table is non - zero . in section  [ numerics ] ,",
    "we give a numerical example combining the coupled surface  subsurface problem and signorini outflow conditions .",
    "we observe that the proposed time discretization leads to a stable method for reasonable time step sizes .",
    "we also observe that the surface water height remains nonnegative as predicted by the theory , with the exception of certain singular points .",
    "our numerical approach proves to be useful even beyond the confines of the assumptions needed for the existence result .",
    "for a better assessment of the unsaturated flow equation , we use kirchoff s transformation to obtain an equivalaent formulation for a global pressure @xmath68 .",
    "we then summarize the resulting fully coupled system with nonlinear boundary conditions and detail all assumptions on the data that we will need for our analysis .",

    "it is also possible to allow @xmath89 as it is the case , e.g. , for brooks ",
    "corey parameter functions  @xcite .",
    "but then the outflow conditions in   and the outflow conditions in are no longer equivalent .",
    "we would have to deal either with the conditions in or with similar conditions formed by replacing @xmath56 by @xmath68 in as done , e.g , in @xcite .",
    "in such case it would be very difficult to give a meaning to the traces in the last equality in , as it demands an a priori estimate for @xmath90 , which in turn necessitates an estimate for @xmath91 . in order to solve this problem , one can either assume @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "if one makes one of these assumptions , it is also possible to show an existence result for the system with original outflow conditions , based on the results in @xcite .",
    "otherwise , it is only feasible to derive a weighted @xmath94-estimate for @xmath95 @xcite and the original outflow conditions have to be replaced by some surrogate ones as suggested in @xcite and  .      in order to guarantee among others the well - definedness of the boundary conditions ,",
