    "one of the possible outcomes of a cosmological phase transition is gravitational radiation .",
    "although it is difficult to detect , gravitational radiation provides a direct probe of the phase transition dynamics , since it propagates freely until the present epoch .",
    "studies of the gravitational waves due to phase transitions at the electroweak scale and beyond @xcite show that the signal may be within the sensitivity range of lisa and the second generation of space - based interferometers .    in a first - order phase transition ,",
    "bubbles of the stable phase nucleate and expand , converting the high - temperature phase into the low - temperature one .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are generated either by the collisions of bubbles @xcite or by the turbulence that is produced in the plasma due to the motion of bubble walls @xcite .",
    "as bubbles expand , latent heat is released at the phase boundary .",
    "part of this energy raises the temperature of the plasma , and another part is converted to bulk motions of the fluid . for phase transitions in the early universe , the reynolds number is large enough for the wall motion to produce turbulence . in general",
    ", the amplitude of gws coming from turbulence dominates over bubble collisions .",
    "the bubble wall can propagate via two modes , namely , detonation and deflagration . for a detonation ,",
    "the phase transition front moves faster than the speed of sound @xmath3 whereas a deflagration front is subsonic .",
    "gws produced by detonations have been extensively investigated @xcite . in this case",
    ", the bubble wall velocity @xmath4 depends only on the ratio of the latent heat to the total energy density , @xmath5 @xcite . since @xmath6 no signal precedes the detonation front .",
    "hence , the dynamics of a wall is not influenced by other bubbles walls ( except in the collision regions ) .",
    "furthermore , the kinetic energy injected into the fluid is concentrated in a thin region behind the wall .",
    "this simplifies the integration of the kinetic - energy density profile .",
    "besides , the temperature in the supercooled phase outside the bubbles decreases due to the expansion of the universe . as a consequence ,",
    "the nucleation rate @xmath7 increases exponentially .",
    "this justifies modeling it by @xmath8 , which corresponds to linearizing the time dependence of the exponent .",
    "hence , @xmath9 is the only time scale in the problem and determines the duration of the phase transition , @xmath10 and the mean bubble separation , @xmath11 thus , the final result depends only on the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "these features simplify the calculation of gws .",
    "the case of deflagrations is more difficult .",
    "in contrast to detonations , the deflagration front velocity depends on the viscosity of the plasma and on the pressure difference between phases , which in turn depends on the amount of supercooling .",
    "the wall propagates at a subsonic velocity and is preceded by a supersonic shock front which affects other bubbles .",
    "the shock wave distributes the latent heat injected by the wall throughout space , causing a reheating of the universe and bulk motions of the fluid far away from the wall . for these reasons ,",
    "the case of deflagrations has not received as much attention as the detonation case . in ref .",
    "@xcite an analytic expression is derived for the signal from bubble collisions . however , in that work the fluid velocity is left as a free parameter .",
    "deflagrations have also been considered numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of gws for the deflagration case thus depends on several parameters , which are difficult to estimate in a specific model . as a consequence ,",
    "the results for detonations have often been used to investigate the gw production in different phase transitions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , disregarding the fact that the phase transition may actually proceed via deflagration bubbles .",
    "notice , indeed , that this is likely the general case .",
    "for instance , for the electroweak phase transition , estimations of the wall velocity give in general subsonic values @xmath13 @xcite , which are favorable for electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to address the case of deflagration bubbles with a realistic approach .",
    "thus , we take into account the fact that the shock waves coming from a bubble wall influence other bubbles . in section [ dynamics ]",
    "we describe the dynamics of deflagration bubbles .",
    "one important feature is that , as a consequence of reheating , the nucleation rate turns - off and the bubble wall decreases during bubble expansion .",
    "therefore , the approximation @xmath14 can not be used in this case .",
    "furthermore , the smaller velocities at the collision time make bubble collisions to be suppressed relative to turbulence as a source of gws . in section [ turb ]",
    "we consider the velocity spectrum of the turbulent fluid that arises from the motion of deflagration walls , and in section [ gw ] we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to derive the gravitational radiation produced by turbulence in the deflagration case . in section [ result ]",
    "we estimate the dependence of the amplitude and peak frequency on the latent heat , the bubble size , and the wall velocity . we show that for a strong enough electroweak phase transition , gws from deflagration bubbles may be detected at lisa .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclu ] .",
    "a phase transition of the universe occurs when the free energy of a system depends on an order parameter @xmath15 ( in general a higgs field ) , which develops a non - zero value . for a first - order phase transition",
    ", there is a temperature range in which the free energy @xmath16 has two minima separated by a barrier . generally , the high - temperature minimum is @xmath17 , corresponding to the symmetric phase , and the low - temperature one is @xmath18 , corresponding to the broken symmetry phase . at the critical temperature @xmath19 , the two minima @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 have the same free energy .",
    "below this temperature , @xmath22 becomes the global minimum . at a certain temperature @xmath23 ,",
    "the barrier disappears and @xmath20 becomes a maximum of the free energy .    the energy density @xmath24 and entropy density @xmath25 are related to the free energy density by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the phase with @xmath17 is composed of radiation and false vacuum , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zero - temperature energy density of the false vacuum , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the zero - temperature effective potential , and @xmath32 is the energy density of radiation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , for the high - temperature phase we have @xmath35 , and for the low - temperature phase we have @xmath36 .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath37 .",
    "hence , at @xmath38 both phases have the same pressure .",
    "the latent heat @xmath39 is defined as the energy density discontinuity @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 . we note that in previous works on gw generation the latent heat is sometimes confused with the false vacuum energy density ( or even with the free energy density ) .",
    "in fact , notice that in general @xmath39 can be anywhere in the range @xmath42 . on the other hand , it can be shown that @xmath29 is bounded by @xmath43 ( assuming that the vacuum energy vanishes at @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "the nucleation and growth of bubbles has been extensively investigated ( see e.g. @xcite ) . according to the standard picture , bubbles of the stable phase nucleate with a rate @xcite",
    "@xmath45where @xmath46 is the three - dimensional instanton action , which coincides with the free energy of a critical bubble .",
    "the nucleation rate is extremely sensitive to the temperature in the range @xmath47 at the critical temperature the radius @xmath48 of the critical bubble becomes infinite , so @xmath49 and @xmath50 in contrast , at @xmath51 the radius vanishes , so @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which is an extremely large rate in comparison to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , bubbles begin to nucleate at an intermediate temperature @xmath55 for which @xmath56 to get an idea of the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath58 , consider the thin - wall approximation , which is valid near the critical temperature . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the surface tension of the bubble wall .",
    "then we obtain the critical radius @xmath61 and the action @xmath62 for @xmath63 we can also approximate the free energy difference by @xmath64 thus , we obtain @xmath65once a bubble is nucleated , it begins to grow .",
    "the bubble radius rapidly becomes much larger than @xmath66 .",
    "due to the viscosity of the plasma , the bubble walls immediately reach a terminal velocity @xmath4 which is determined by the pressure difference @xmath67 and the friction with the surrounding particles .",
    "it can be approximated by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a friction coefficient . using again the linear approximation for @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71for strong phase transitions",
    ", the latent heat @xmath39 and the amount of supercooling @xmath72 will be considerable .",
    "notice , however , that the velocity depends also on the viscosity and can be subsonic even in this case .",
    "we shall assume that the wall propagates as a deflagration front .",
    "therefore , the wall velocity is lower than the speed of sound in the relativistic plasma , @xmath73 . in this case",
    ", a shock front precedes the wall with a velocity @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the shock front of a bubble soon influences other bubbles . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the latent heat is transmitted away from the wall and is quickly distributed throughout space .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by considering a homogeneous reheating of the plasma as latent heat is being injected @xcite .",
    "even with this simple approximation , the evolution of the phase transition must be computed numerically .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to find relations between thermodynamic parameters such as @xmath39 or @xmath76 and the quantities that characterize the dynamics , such as the duration of the phase transition or the bubble number density .    nevertheless , as we shall see , the general features of the dynamics of slow bubble walls provide a good deal of information for the computation of gravitational waves . as a consequence of reheating , the free energy difference @xmath77 decreases and , according to eq .",
    "( [ vw ] ) , the bubble expansion slows down .",
    "this effect will be important if the latent heat is comparable to the difference @xmath78 .",
    "thus , if @xmath79 the temperature will get very close to the critical one . for weaker phase transitions ,",
    "the latent heat is smaller , but so is @xmath80 . ] .",
    "then , the velocity will decrease significantly and a long phase coexistence stage will take place before the transition completes @xcite . in any case , due to the exponential dependence of the nucleation rate on temperature ,",
    "bubble nucleation turns off as soon as temperature begins to raise @xcite . indeed , notice that the temperature @xmath81 has a minimum , which separates the supercooling and reheating stages .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ s3 ] ) , the nucleation rate has a maximum at that time , and due to the extreme dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath82 , the maximum must be a sharp peak .",
    "hence , the minimum temperature gives the nucleation temperature @xmath83 .",
    "most bubbles are created in a very short time interval @xmath84 around the time @xmath85 corresponding to this temperature .    for @xmath86 ,",
    "the number density of bubbles @xmath87 remains constant .",
    "the final size of bubbles is given by @xmath88 .",
    "most bubbles begin to expand at @xmath89 with velocity @xmath90 . during reheating the wall velocity decreases , and by the time bubbles percolate @xmath91 will be in general much smaller than the initial velocity @xmath92 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gw signal from bubble collisions will be too low .",
    "therefore , we will consider only gws from turbulence .",
    "the main turbulence will be generated during the reheating stage , when @xmath4 is still close to @xmath93 the frequency and amplitude of the gws will depend on the dynamics of the phase transition , which is involved . however , as we shall see , the result will be essentially determined by a few parameters .",
    "turbulence from stirring in cosmological phase transitions has been extensively studied @xcite . when turbulence is fully developed , a cascade of energy is established from larger to smaller length scales , as eddies of each size break into smaller ones .",
    "we define the energy dissipation rate per unit enthalpy for a given momentum scale @xmath94@xmath95where @xmath96 is the enthalpy density , @xmath97 is the total energy density of the fluid , @xmath98 is the pressure , and @xmath99 is the kinetic energy density of turbulence . since the phase transition occurs in the radiation dominated epoch , we will make for simplicity the usual assumption . for a thermal phase transition",
    "the false - vacuum energy is bounded by @xmath100 and is in general @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "part of @xmath102 is liberated as latent heat , so that at the end of the transition we have @xmath103 @xmath104 .",
    "hence , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "if the process is stationary , @xmath107 gives the rate at which turbulent energy is received at the scale @xmath108 from higher length scales ( and transferred to smaller length scales ) .",
    "if the external source stirs the fluid at a single scale @xmath109 , we have a constant rate @xmath110 for scales @xmath111 @xcite . in this case the turbulent energy in the cascade",
    "is characterized by the kolmogoroff spectrum @xmath112the cascade stops at the damping scale @xmath113 , with @xmath114 at which the fluid viscosity dissipates the injected energy into heat .    as usual , we assume that the fluid is incompressible and statistically isotropic and homogeneous",
    ". then , the fourier transform of the velocity has the two point correlation function @xmath115where the angular brackets mean a statistical average . notice that @xmath116 gives the kinetic energy density per unit enthalpy density of the fluid",
    "therefore , the velocity spectrum @xmath117 can be related to the energy spectrum @xmath118 .",
    "the relation is @xmath119 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) , we have @xmath120 in the inertial range @xmath121 . the power spectrum @xmath117 beyond this range",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from an ansatz for the real - space correlation function .",
    "we have @xmath122 and the normalization of the spectrum is given by @xmath123 which corresponds to the fluid velocity on the largest scale @xmath124 ( see below ) .    for stationary turbulence , the energy dissipation rate in eq .",
    "( [ epsk0 ] ) must equal the power that is injected by the source .",
    "thus , for the case of expanding bubbles we have @xmath125where @xmath126 is the fraction of volume occupied by bubbles and @xmath127 is an efficiency factor which quantifies the fraction of latent heat that goes into kinetic energy of the fluid ( a fraction @xmath128 goes into thermal energy and causes reheating of the plasma ) .",
    "the shock wave in front of the wall sets the fluid moving outward with a velocity @xmath129 .",
    "hence , the injected kinetic - energy density is @xmath130as the phase transition front moves a distance @xmath131 , the energy released is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "assuming for simplicity a constant fluid velocity up to a distance @xmath133 , the kinetic energy injected in the time @xmath134 will be proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath136we still need to determine the fluid velocity @xmath129 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ rhoturb ] ) .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum @xmath137 can be applied to the wall discontinuity to obtain relations for the quantities on both sides of the wall . assuming a stationary solution and non - relativistic velocities , one obtains the equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath138where @xmath139 is the enthalpy",
    ", @xmath140 is the velocity of the fluid in the rest frame of the phase transition front , and the plus and minus signs stand for the high- and low - temperature phase regions , respectively . in the rest frame of the center of the bubble",
    ", the fluid inside the bubble is at rest , the wall velocity is @xmath141 , and the fluid velocity in front of the wall is @xmath142 using eq .",
    "( [ encons ] ) we obtain @xmath143where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the energy - density and pressure differences across the wall .",
    "notice that , even if the temperature is homogeneous , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are different in each phase . @xmath148 and @xmath149 depend on the amount of supercooling . for simplicity , we will assume that the temperature remains close to the critical one , so that @xmath150 and the energy density discontinuity is given by the latent heat , @xmath151 therefore , we have @xmath152from eqs .",
    "( [ rhoturb ] ) , ( [ defkappa ] ) , and ( [ vf ] ) we obtain @xmath153thus , eq .",
    "( [ drhoturb ] ) gives @xmath154where we have defined the ratio of the latent heat to the enthalpy density , @xmath155 .",
    "for the validity of the kolmogoroff spectrum , it is important that the energy is injected at a single scale @xmath124 . for the kind of phase transitions we are interested in , all the bubbles are formed in a short interval @xmath84 around the time @xmath156",
    "hence , the number density of bubbles @xmath157 is set at @xmath89 . for @xmath158 ,",
    "the number of bubbles remains constant , and the wall velocity @xmath159 is the same for all bubbles .",
    "the bubble radius is @xmath160 and the distribution of sizes has a small width @xmath161 at the moment of collision the bubble size is given by the distance between bubble centers , @xmath162    in fact , turbulence begins as soon as the _ shock _ fronts collide .",
    "the first shocks are emitted at @xmath163 and collide when they reach the size @xmath164 after a time @xmath165 .",
    "this time is much smaller than the total duration @xmath166 of the phase transition .",
    "indeed , for deflagrations the wall velocity is @xmath167 .",
    "in addition , as explained in section [ dynamics ] , @xmath91 decreases significantly from its initial value @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , as mentioned in section [ intro ] , in the general case the initial velocity may be already @xmath170 , as suggested by the electroweak case .",
    "when shock fronts collide , they lose their spherical symmetry .",
    "bubbles continue expanding , and their walls continue injecting energy into the fluid until all space is filled up .",
    "thus , turbulence begins very soon , at @xmath171 and remains until the phase transition is complete .",
    "as bubbles expand , the latent heat is taken away at the speed of sound , always stirring the fluid at the same scale @xmath172 hence , it is reasonable to assume a kolmogoroff spectrum with @xmath173 notice that in the detonation case , in contrast , there will be much more small bubbles ( with @xmath174 ) than large ones ( with @xmath175 ) , due to the exponentially increasing nucleation rate @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the small bubbles will in principle modify the kolmogoroff spectrum in the detonation case",
    ".    it is important to estimate the turnover time scale of an eddy , @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the characteristic fluid velocity on a length scale @xmath179 .",
    "the rate at which an eddy breaks into smaller ones is usually assumed to be roughly @xmath180 thus , the rate at which energy is transferred in the cascade is @xmath181 therefore , we have @xmath182 and @xmath183 the turnover frequency is given by @xmath184 , with @xmath185 .    both @xmath178 and @xmath186 increase with @xmath179 .",
    "the maximum length scale is the characteristic scale of the source @xmath187 . in general",
    ", @xmath188 is well inside the horizon @xcite .",
    "hence , the time scale for the establishment of a cascade , which is on the order of the maximum turnover time @xmath189 will be at most on the order of the hubble time .",
    "this justifies neglecting the expansion of the universe in the description of turbulence . on the other hand , it is important to compare the characteristic turnover time with the duration of the phase transition . for the case of detonations , it has been shown that @xmath190 is always larger than @xmath166 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result is more general .",
    "indeed , since @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and the fluid velocity is always smaller than the wall velocity , we have @xmath193 . since the stirring source lasts less than @xmath194 , turbulence is not stationary .",
    "nevertheless , the cascade of energy develops , and it was argued @xcite that , for the generation of gravitational waves , we can assume stationary turbulence with a duration @xmath195 .",
    "we aim to calculate the spectrum we would observe today for gws originated in a cosmological phase transition at time @xmath196 and temperature @xmath197 . as explained in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] , in the deflagration bubble scenario the wall velocity is in general considerably smaller at the time of percolation than at the beginning of bubble expansion . therefore , we expect a weak signal from bubble collisions . in view of that",
    ", we shall only consider the source provided by turbulence .",
    "the calculation of the gw spectrum from primordial turbulence has been improved in the last years @xcite . here",
    "we will use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the discussion in sec . [ conclu ] ) . in this section",
    "we briefly review the derivation and write down the results in terms of variables that are suitable for the deflagration bubble scenario .    for a stochastic background of gravitational waves ,",
    "the spectrum is characterized by the quantity @xcite @xmath198where @xmath199 is the energy density of the gws , @xmath200 is the frequency , and @xmath201 is the critical energy density today , @xmath202 thus , the gravitational wave energy density per unit logarithmic frequency is defined by the relation @xmath203 for a stochastic background , @xmath204 is given by the ensemble average of the fourier amplitudes of the tensor metric perturbation @xmath205 .",
    "the energy density of gravitational waves is @xmath206 where the brackets denote the ensemble average .",
    "the source of @xmath207 is the transverse and traceless piece of the stress - energy tensor , which for a turbulent plasma is given by @xmath208 thus , the source for tensor perturbations on each mode @xmath209 is the anisotropic stress @xmath210 , which involves a convolution @xmath211 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , the energy density spectrum , which involves the average @xmath212 , can be related to the velocity spectrum @xmath117 by means of eq .",
    "( [ twopoint ] ) .",
    "notice that the velocity correlation function ( [ twopoint ] ) does not oscillate in time .",
    "however , the gravitational radiation is produced by the turbulent eddies , which have a turnover frequency @xmath213 , with @xmath214 .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the source , which is relevant for the generation of gws , is lost in the statistical average .",
    "one can account for the turnover frequency by replacing @xmath215 for @xmath216 . as a consequence ,",

    "we set @xmath224 and @xmath225 . for @xmath226 ,",
    "the gravitational wave propagates freely , with the dispersion relation @xmath227 .",
    "hence , the frequency @xmath200 in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) is given by the wave number @xmath108 of the source .",
    "the amplitude of the wave is proportional to @xmath210 and depends on the frequency @xmath228 of the source .",

    "the bubble expansion rate depends on the wall velocity and the bubble size .",
    "roughly , @xmath292 where @xmath293 is a geometrical factor ( for a spherical bubble , @xmath294 ) , and @xmath295 is the average wall velocity . in general , it will not be a good approximation to take a plain time average over the entire duration of the phase transition .",
    "the bubble expansion will slow down significantly due to reheating .",
    "therefore , the turbulence that is generated while the wall velocity @xmath4 is close to its initial value @xmath168 will give the main contribution to @xmath296 .",
    "hence , we can use @xmath168 instead of @xmath297 in the approximations above . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) and using @xmath298 , @xmath299 , we have @xmath300 again , we see that strong phase transitions favor detection at lisa , since the amplitude is maximized for large values of @xmath301 ( which also give millihertz frequencies ) .",
    "weak phase transitions give smaller values of @xmath302 , and also smaller values of @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "therefore , we will have very low values of @xmath305 , together with high values of the frequency , @xmath306 .",
    "in that case , the generated gws will not be detected by lisa , but may be detected by space - based interferometers of second generation , such as bbo .",
    "let us consider an electroweak phase transition at @xmath307 , with @xmath308 , and set @xmath309 the bubble separation @xmath188 depends on the extension of the standard model .",
    "for the frequency to be in the band that lisa is sensitive to , the phase transition should be strongly first - order , so that @xmath310 .",
    "thus , for a wall velocity @xmath311 eq .",
    "( [ omapp ] ) gives @xmath312 provided that the latent heat is large enough ( i.e. , @xmath313 ) . a large latent heat is consistent with a strongly first - order phase transition .",
    "this value of @xmath296 is just at the detection threshold of lisa .",
    "notice , however , that this is an order - of - magnitude estimate , and the result is sensitive to several parameters . for instance , the enthalpy difference @xmath314 in eq .",
    "( [ vfenth ] ) will give a larger efficiency factor if it is evaluated at the supercooling temperature @xmath315 for a phase transition at @xmath316 eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) gives the required frequency @xmath317 for a value @xmath318 . in this case , for @xmath313 and @xmath319 we have @xmath320 in fig .",
    "[ figat ] we plot the minimum value of @xmath5 that is needed to achieve a peak value @xmath321 with a peak frequency @xmath322 for a phase ransition that takes place at @xmath197 .",
    "we have considered the production of gravitational waves in a first - order phase transition , due to the turbulence that arises from the motion of deflagration fronts .",
    "as we have seen , the dynamics of the phase transition is completely different from the case of detonations .",
    "the main difference is the fact that deflagration walls are preceded by shock fronts , which move much faster than them and influence other bubbles .",
    "this affects both the bubble expansion and the generation of gws .",
    "firstly , as soon as bubbles begin to nucleate and expand , the shock fronts collide and the spherical symmetry is lost .",
    "hence , gravitational radiation can be emitted before percolation occurs .",
    "secondly , the quick distribution of latent heat causes a global reheating . as a consequence , the nucleation rate turns - off after a very short time , and the bubble growth slows down . we have taken these facts into account to calculate the spectrum of gws in a realistic scenario for deflagrations .",
    "we have shown that the usual assumptions for the turbulent fluid , namely , the validity of the kolmogoroff spectrum and the short duration of turbulence in comparison to the hubble time , apply to the case of deflagration bubbles .",
    "we have also derived an analytical approximation for the efficiency factor @xmath323 for the deflagration case . in previous works",
    "this factor was either calculated numerically or using rough estimations .",
    "this analytical approximation makes the treatment of the deflagration case simpler , and will be particularly helpful for including the gw calculation in numerical computations of the phase transition .",
    "we have used the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the gw spectrum from primordial turbulence .",
    "there , it is assumed that the frequency @xmath324 of a gravitational wave is determined by the wavenumber of the source mode that generates it , i.e. , @xmath227 , rather than being determined by the characteristic frequency of that mode , @xmath325 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gw spectrum inherits the characteristic wavelength of the source , and the peak is at @xmath326 .",
    "this is correct for a stochastic and statistically homogeneous source of short duration .",
    "recently @xcite , it was argued that the turbulent source lasts long enough so that it can be treated as stationary . in that case , the resulting gw spectrum would be imprinted with the characteristic frequency of the source , and we would have @xmath327 . however , the duration of turbulence is on the order of the characteristic turnover time @xmath328 ( since the duration of the stirring source is shorter ) .",
    "therefore , the characteristic frequency and the duration of the source of gws are related by @xmath329 , and the typical frequency of the gws is given by the typical wave number of the source @xcite .",
    "the gw spectrum depends on quantities such as @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath164 which require a numerical computation of the phase transition for a more accurate evaluation .",
    "we will address such computation elsewhere @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our estimations show that gws generated in a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition might be detected by lisa .",
    "the parameter values for which this is possible are roughly constrained by @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 .",
    "weakly first - order phase transitions correspond in general to smaller values of @xmath336 , @xmath91 and @xmath5 . in that case",
    ", the spectrum will have a smaller amplitude and the characteristic frequency will be away from the peak sensitivity of lisa .",
