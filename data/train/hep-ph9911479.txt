    "r  parity conservation is often assumed in supersymmetric model building in order to prevent a host of phenomenological complications such as fast proton decay .",

    "however , r ",
    "parity conservation is not a _ necessary _ condition for avoiding many of these problems .",
    "for example , the imposition of other discrete symmetries , such as conservation of either baryon number or lepton number , may be adequate to provide phenomenologically acceptable models .",

    "therefore , one is led to question just how much r ",
    "parity violation can be introduced without conflict with current experimental data . in this paper",
    ", we study the radiative corrections from r  parity violating extensions of the mssm to the electroweak observables in hadronic @xmath0 decays , namely the ratios of hadronic partial widths and the parity violating asymmetries . experimental data from lep and sld place stringent limits on the size of these corrections , thereby constraining the possible strengths of the r  violating interactions .",
    "we focus on the effects of the r  parity violating superpotential and neglect possible effects from the corresponding soft  breaking terms @xcite .",
    "this simplification allows us to rotate away the bilinear terms @xcite . in this case",
    ", the r  parity violating superpotential has the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the mssm superfields defined in the usual fashion @xcite , and the subscripts @xmath18 are the generation indices",
    ". these interactions can give potentially sizeable radiative corrections to the hadronic observables depending on the size of the coupling constants @xmath19 , @xmath1 , and @xmath20 . the @xmath19 couplings are already tightly constrained to be @xmath21 or less , and their effect on the @xmath0peak observables is negligible @xcite . the constraints on the @xmath1 and @xmath20 couplings are much less stringent .",
    "however , they can not be present simultaneously in the lagrangian since this would lead to unacceptably fast proton decay @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can make the further simplifying assumption that only one or other of the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 is present at a time .    when constraining r  violating interactions using experimental data , it is important to provide a consistent accounting of the corrections from the r  conserving sector also since they may be sizable depending on the choice of susy parameters .",
    "it is also important to include _ all _ the affected observables in a global fit since different observables may pull the fit values in opposite directions .",
    "this was illustrated in our previous paper @xcite in which the violation of lepton universality was used to constrain the @xmath24 couplings .",
    "there , the @xmath0lineshape observables alone preferred a 2@xmath9 limit of @xmath25 , but a global fit resulted in @xmath26 .",
    "neither of these points were considered in previous works such as ref .",
    "@xcite where r  conserving corrections were neglected altogether , and only corrections to the ratios of hadronic to leptonic partial widths @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) were considered .",
    "it is clear that these ratios receive r  conserving corrections from top  higgs and chargino  sfermion loops , as well as qcd and gluino corrections which depend strongly on @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the resulting 1@xmath9 bound of @xmath30 of ref .",
    "@xcite is hardly robust .    in this paper , we consider all the purely hadronic observables which can be expressed as ratios of the quark couplings to the @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ the ratios of hadronic partial widths and the parity violating asymmetry parameters .",
    "these are unaffected by qcd and gluino corrections since they modify the left and right  handed quark couplings multiplicatively , leaving the ratios of the couplings intact .",
    "the rest of the r  conserving sector induces relevant corrections to the _ left  handed _",
    "quark couplings only , whereas the r  breaking sector affects predominantly the _",
    "right  handed _ quark couplings .",
    "this allows us to parametrize and constrain the r  conserving and r  breaking corrections separately , thereby constraining the r  breaking sector without making _ ad hoc _ assumptions about the r  conserving sector .",
    "also , since we incorporate into our fit the corrections to the forward  backward and polarization asymmetries which are much more sensitive than @xmath31 to the shifts in the _ right  handed _",
    "quark couplings , we are able to substantially improve the limits on the r  breaking interactions .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : prelim ] we discuss the approximations we make to simplify our analysis . in sections  [ sec :",

    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "as we stated in the introduction , we only consider supersymmetric r  violating interactions and neglect the effects of soft  breaking r  violating terms .",
    "we also neglect the @xmath19 interactions and consider only the @xmath24 or the @xmath32 interactions at a time .",
    "in addition , left ",
    "right squark mixing is neglected since their effects are expected to be unimportant @xcite . even with these simplifications",
    ", we still have 27 independent @xmath24 couplings or 9 independent @xmath32 couplings which must be considered .    however , a careful look at the diagrams which must be calculated begets a further simplification .",
    "the corrections to the @xmath33 vertex generated by the @xmath24 and @xmath32 interactions in the superpotential fall into four classes :    1 .",
    "one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams with two scalars and one fermion in the loop .",
    "1pi diagrams with two fermions and one scalar in the loop .",
    "1pi diagrams with two fermions and one scalar in the loop , with two mass insertions on the fermion lines .",
    "fermion wavefunction renormalization diagrams .    in these diagrams ,",
    "it is clear that the scalar must be the sparticle while the internal fermion must be an ordinary lepton or quark .",
    "the invariant masses of the external gauge boson and the external fermions must be set to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .    of the four classes ,",
    "the third class is finite while the @xmath36 poles of the first two classes cancel against the poles in the fermion wavefunction renormalizations .",
    "an explicit evaluation of the finite pieces of the diagrams reveal @xcite that they lead to numerically significant contributions only when the fermion running in the loop is heavy .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of a diagram with a massless internal fermion is only about 10% of that with an internal top ",
    "quark , assuming that the scalar ( sfermion ) mass is the same .",
    "since each diagram is proportional to @xmath24 or @xmath32 _ squared _ , dropping these 10% contributions to the amplitude will result in a 5% uncertainty in the limits obtained for the @xmath24 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can therefore neglect any diagram which does not involve a top  quark .",
    "this means that the only r  violating couplings which are relevant to our discussion are @xmath37 ( 9 parameters ) and @xmath38 ( 3 parameters ) .",
    "furthermore , the values of the top  quark diagrams at @xmath39 provide an excellent approximation to the full integral .",
    "henceforth we work in this approximation .",
    "( we note that the diagrams carrying only massless fermions would vanish in this limit even if we had previously retained them . )    in the limit @xmath39 , the four classes of diagrams can be written in terms of the @xmath36 pole piece and two independent functions of the fermion ",
    "scalar mass ratio @xmath40 which we call @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "their explicit forms are shown in the appendix .",
    "we note that @xmath42 , the function which appears in the two  scalar one  fermion , and the fermion wavefunction renormalization diagrams , vanishes rapidly as @xmath43 .",

    "these bounds significantly improve the 1@xmath9 bound of @xmath166 from @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these improvements on the bounds of @xmath24 and @xmath32 are a consequence of the fact that while the data prefers a _ positive _ shift in the right  handed coupling of the @xmath3 , which is non ",
    "zero by 2.6@xmath9 , both @xmath24 and @xmath32 corrections shift the coupling in the negative direction .",
    "this situation is mitigated neither by introducing sfermion mass splittings nor by increasing @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we performed a _ classical _ statistical analysis , i.e. we performed a fit to the data without any _ a priori _ assumptions about the viability of the model .",
    "in particular , we made no assumptions about the signs of the coupling shifts when fitting the data .",

    "this technique assumes that r - violating susy is the correct underlying theory , and therefore that the shifts to the right - handed couplings are only permitted to be negative and @xmath130 positive .",
    "the resulting confidence intervals for the couplings squared are positive , and the preferred values are those of the standard model ( i.e. zero ) .    however , care should be taken when using these bounds , since they hide the fact that the @xmath145 of the corresponding fit is quite large even at low confidence levels .",
    "the probability of these bounds arising as a result of statistical fluctuations is therefore quite small .",
    "below we list the @xmath167 @xmath168 confidence levels from the constrained fit :    @xmath169    the corresponding confidence limits on the couplings are : @xmath170 @xmath171 the best - fit value for @xmath130 is negative .",

    "the @xmath145 corresponding to the @xmath172 and @xmath173 confidence intervals for @xmath135 are :    @xmath174    we see explicitly that the bounds obtained using the bayesian analysis are weak , but the @xmath145 associated with these bounds is uncomfortably large . if the error bars continue to shrink and the central values stay unchanged , the relevance of the constrained fit bounds must be questioned .",
    "we find that the hadronic @xmath0decay data from lep and sld can be used to place significant constraints on the size of r  parity violating @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings .",
    "this is possible because the dominant r  violating interactions correct the couplings of the right  handed down  type quarks only while the dominant r  conserving mssm interactions correct only the left  handed couplings .",
    "the parity violating asymmetry parameters @xmath175 are particularly sensitive to shifts in the right  handed quark couplings while blind to shifts in the left  handed couplings .",
    "this allows us to constrain the r  violating interactions independently from the r  conserving sector .",
