    "the femtoscopic correlation function , @xmath3 , is defined as a ratio of the probability to observe a correlated pair of particles at a given relative momentum in the same event ( numerator ) , @xmath4 , to the probability to observe such a pair in an uncorrelated state ( denominator ) , @xmath5 : @xmath6 the uncorrelated distribution is usually obtained by mixing particles from different events . here the relative momentum is given in the pair center of mass frame as @xmath7 for particles 1 and 2 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the notation commonly used for femtoscopic correlations for pairs of two different types of particles , and will be used interchangeably with @xmath9 ( traditionally used in femtoscopic correlations of pairs of identical partilces ) later in the paper .",
    "we expand the numerator , denominator and correlation function in spherical harmonics , e.g. : @xmath10    .conditions on the distribution imply relations between the different terms in the @xmath11 expansion .",
    "condition 1 is always valid for the true and mixed pair distributions and the correlation function .",
    "condition 5 is always valid for like pair correlation and the corresponding pairs distributions . by exploiting symmetries in 2 - 5",
    ", we can reduce the number of components in our data vectors .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can compute the pairs distributions directly in spherical harmonics by observing that @xmath12 can be built up by summing over the pairs , which is essentially a monte - carlo integration process : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the number of pairs in the spectrum . in our approach",
    "a pair is added to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the following way .",
    "first we calculate the relative momentum @xmath17 and decompose it into @xmath18 ( which determines the 1d @xmath19-bin number ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . having the angles , we can calculate the spherical harmonics functions , usually up to some limiting value of @xmath22 .",
    "then the pair is added to all histograms of the corresponding function , with weights equal to the respective @xmath11 s .",
    "we could eliminate many of the components of @xmath15 and @xmath16 by taking advantage of the symmetries in table i , but we have chosen to keep all components so that we can perform cross - checks of our work .",
    "this does introduce complications when performing some matrix manipulations , as we discuss in the following section .",
    "the covariance can be built in a similiar way by noting ( @xmath23 only ) : @xmath24 taking the diagonal elements ( i.e. @xmath25 ) , we find ( uncorrelated ) uncertainties of @xmath26    in contrast with our approach , in the traditional representation both the numerator and denominator were stored as 3d histograms , using either the bertsch - pratt coordinates @xcite in cartesian form @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , or in spherical : @xmath18 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . in the traditional representation",
    "the numerator ( denominator ) is a 3d histogram , and each signal ( background ) pair is added to exactly one bin of this histogram with weight 1.0 .",
    "this representation has several disadvantages : one needs significant statistics to have a meaningful number of pairs in each bin , single - particle momentum acceptance can result in `` holes '' or empty bins in two - particle , or relative momentum space , and the binning corrections need to be applied . also going to higher moments in the decomposition",
    "requires larger number of bins on the @xmath31 and @xmath32 direction .    in practice , we store both the real and imaginary parts of the numerator and the denominator as an array of one - dimensional histograms in @xmath33 , as seen in eq .  , which is represented as the vector @xmath34 : @xmath35 there is also a corresponding covariance matrix @xmath36 , which is a two - dimensional matrix for each @xmath19-bin and is packed in an analogous fashion .",
    "since we have expanded the pair distributions and the correlation in spherical harmonics , we have @xmath37 with the packing in eq .",
    ", equation can be written very compactly : @xmath38 .",
    "gives us a way to compute @xmath39 directly from the pair distributions expanded in spherical harmonics .    here",
    "the @xmath40 matrix is written in terms of wigner 3-@xmath41 symbols as : @xmath42    in order to calculate the correlation function , we view the problem as an inverse problem . to solve it",
    ", one needs to minimize the @xmath43 : @xmath44 the formula uses the full covariance matrix in the true distribution , but not in the mixed pair distribution .",
    "because the mixed pair distribution is constructed by pairs from different events , it is not limited by statistics and can be computed to arbitrarily high precision , making the uncertainties negligible for our purposes .",
    "the problem of minimizing the @xmath43 is identical to the one posed by the imaging procedure in ref . @xcite and",
    "the solution is well known : @xmath45 where the covariance is also calculated : @xmath46 the uncorrelated uncertainties of the correlation are just the square root of the trace of the covariance @xmath47 : @xmath48 . written out",
    ", we are simply taking the diagonal elements ( i.e. @xmath25 ) and finding ( uncorrelated ) uncertainties of @xmath49 with the error propagation done in this way , one gets the cross-@xmath50 correlations in the covariance matrix by virtue of the cross-@xmath50 correlations built into the @xmath51 and @xmath36 matrices .",
    "we compute the correlation function according to eq .  .",
    "as this involves several matrix inversions , it is important to make sure that the matrix determinant is not zero .",
    "that means that one can not use @xmath50 combinations that are a linear combination of other @xmath50 s .",
    "as all of the pair distributions are real , we can not keep @xmath52 and @xmath53 components at the same time ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we adopt the convention to only use positive components ( including @xmath54 component ) .",
    "therefore we remove all functions with negative @xmath55 from both @xmath34 and @xmath56 when solving eq .",
    "( [ cformula ] ) .",
    "one can add the missing negative @xmath55 components to the correlation function by multiplying the positive @xmath55 values by the appropriate factor of @xmath57 .",
    "for consistency one may repeat the procedure , this time removing the positive @xmath55 components from @xmath34 and @xmath56 and the obtained results should be identical .",
    "we remind the reader that each @xmath19 bin is independent in @xmath34 , @xmath56 and @xmath58 . therefore solving eq .",
    "can be done for each @xmath19 bin independently .",
    "the starting points then are not vectors of functions , but simply vectors of real numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the result is also a vector of real numbers @xmath61 .",
    "a covariance matrix @xmath62 is in this case a 2d matrix of real numbers , as is the resulting correlation function covariance matrix @xmath63 .",
    "solution of eq .   then reduces to a problem of solving a set of linear equations , for which many standard numerical algorithms exist .",
    "the procedure is repeated for each @xmath19 bin and the @xmath58 vector is filled in steps .",
    "we have tested and applied the formalism to the construction of two - particle correlation functions for identical and non - identical particles in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our tests include a study of the robustness of our approach in the presence of @xmath64 acceptance holes in relative momentum , a common occurance in experiments including the star experiment of which one of the authors ( kisiel ) is a collaboration member .",
    "below we present some tests of the method with a realistic model .",
    "two particles are femtoscopically correlated if they have a small relative momentum @xmath65 in the pairs rest frame ( for identical particles we use @xmath66 ) .",
    "if they are not identical and have different masses , they must have different momenta in the laboratory frame .",
    "in such case it can happen that due to specific momentum acceptance of the experiment , pairs with specific values of @xmath67 and certain combinations of polar and azimuthal components of @xmath68 can not be measured . in terms of the spherical harmonic representation ,",
    "this results in a hole in the pair acceptance for certain regions in @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is observed e.g. for pion - kaon pairs in the star experiment .",
    "such a hole presents a methodological problem for traditional methods of decomposing the correlation function in spherical harmonics as they rely on the existence of certain symmetries in pair distributions .",
    "in particular , they assume that the multiplicity of pairs with a given @xmath72 is equal to the multiplicity of pairs with @xmath73 . for non - identical particles",
    "there is no such symmetry . while it is certainly possible to improve the existing methods and to remove this dependence , we propose to move to the more advanced decomposition method presented in this paper and bypass the problem altogether . in our method ,",
    "this hole is reflected in both the numerator and denominator by a lower number of pairs contributing at some bins of @xmath69 .",
    "examples of the numerator of the correlation function , binned directly in spherical harmonics , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numlm ] . in this case , the distributions result from a simulation of the @xmath74 correlation function in the therminator model using the star detector acceptance @xcite .",
    "the acceptance is symmetric with respect to @xmath75 so the @xmath76 component vanishes  @xcite .",
    "all the imaginary components vanish .",
    "also the @xmath77 as well as @xmath78 and @xmath79 vanish due to polar angle symmetry . apart from that",
    ", the numerator shows non - trivial structure both as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the synergy between spherical harmonic decomposition and femtoscopic correlation function is nicely illustrated in this plot .",
    "a full 3d information , which in traditional 3d implementation would require tens of thousands of bins to store , is reduced to a few 1d histograms . out of these only a select few carry important information , while others conveniently vanish due to the intrinsic symmetries of the pair distribution .",
    "the significance of the components diminishes with growing @xmath22 , ensuring that cutting the decomposition at some @xmath80 should not distort the function .",
    "having in mind that the underlying numerator has a non - trivial structure both in @xmath69 and @xmath70 it is interesting to see how the correlation function itself , calculated with the method above , behaves .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfnlm ] .",
    "again , the imaginary components all vanish , as they should .",
    "the @xmath81 component shows the expected behavior coming from a coulomb repulsion of same charge pion and kaon .",
    "the @xmath82 and @xmath83 components show small deviations from zero , which signals the fact that the size of the underlying system is not the same in the @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 directions .",
    "also the @xmath87 component deviates from zero significantly , a signature of the average emission point asymmetry between pions and kaons . in summary",
    "the example confirms several important points : ( a ) the correlation function can be calculated via the direct @xmath11 method .",
    "( b ) the important physics signals in @xmath81 , @xmath87 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are preserved .",
    "( c ) other components of the correlation function vanish , as they should - an important cross - check of the method .      to attempt to determine the practical limits of the technique , we have performed a test .",
    "first , we calculate the correlation function for identical pions using the therminator model .",
    "we chose to use identical neutral pion pairs for the calculation simply because final state interactions do not distort the correlation appreciably , meaning that the correlation shape can be characterized simply by the correlation radii @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the source size has been set to reasonable values in the longitudinally co - moving system ( of @xmath91 fm ) .",
    "the first calculation does not have any acceptance holes .",
    "we then repeat the calculation , introducing an artificial hole in the acceptance by removing both from the numerator and denominator all pairs within the hole .",
    "the hole is at midrapidity ( small @xmath92 ) , small @xmath19 ( from @xmath93 to @xmath94 gev / c ) and with varying width in @xmath70 ( from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfhole ] .",
    "one can see that introducing the hole had no influence on the extracted correlation function within statistical errors .",
    "indeed , the dominant effect of the acceptance hole has been to decrease statistics , increasing statistical scatter and the corresponding uncertainty . to further make this point",
    ", we show the analytical prediction for how the spherical harmonics should look like for these sizes in the black dashed lines .",
    "as one can see , all points follow the lines perfectly .",
    "our results are in contrast to what would happen in the traditional approach of expanding the correlation in spherical harmonics after making the ratio of 3d histograms .",
    "if there is poor statistics due to a gap in acceptance , then one will need a large number of spherical moments to capture the purely statistical fluctations present in the poorly populated high-@xmath19 bins .",
    "what is more insidious , because the correlation is a ratio , the structure in poorly determined 3d bins appear to `` cancel out '' even when the poorly resolved data should not cancel out .",
    "rather , the poor statistics should give rise to large uncertainties and not contribute to the spherical harmonic expansion ( which is what happens in our method ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfrad ] , we show the values of the analytical fit to the spherical harmonics vs. the hole size .",
    "the lines are the `` input radii '' from the therminator model . as one sees ,",
    "the fit results are very stable and moreover in reasonable agreement with the input values .",
    "note : exact agreement between the input and extracted radii can not be expected because the collective motion in the therminator model shrinks the effective homogeneity length seen by the pairs and hence the correlation radii .",
    "even the very large hole of @xmath96 ( only a quarter of acceptance remaining ! ) our method seems to preserve all the relevant components , provided that enough statistics remains outside the hole region .      in order to be useful , the procedure for calculating the correlation function directly in spherical harmonics should allow for the application of the standard experimental corrections .",
    "here we briefly describe how this can be done",
    ".    experimental resolution for two - particle reconstruction and identification is usually dominated by two issues : track merging ( where two tracks in the detector are reconstructed as one ) and track splitting ( where a single track is mistakenly reconstructed as two ) .",
    "these have non - trivial dependence on both the particle momenta as well as their trajectory in the detector .",
    "this is usually corrected for by assigning a weight to each pair , based on the detailed detector simulation .",
    "such weighting can be incorporated in the procedure in a straightforward way . when filling the numerator and the denominator with pairs , one simply fills it with the appropriate weight .",
    "mathematically it amounts to modifying eq .   by multiplying the @xmath97 by an additional weight @xmath98 , coming from the above mentioned correction .",
    "another common issue is the particle purity , namely the fraction of pairs in the sample that should be treated as correlated .",
    "a pair may be not correlated if one of the particles is misidentified or if at least one of the particles comes from a weak decay .",
    "the experiment should be able to estimate the the average purity of pairs @xmath99 , which can be ( and usually is ) a function of particles momenta , and therefore also of the pair relative momentum @xmath9 .",
    "we use the traditional formula : @xmath100 from the correlation function @xmath101 , we can obtain the correlation effect @xmath102 . in",
    "spherical harmonic representation this only modifies the @xmath103 component : @xmath104 , while others remain the same : @xmath105 .",
    ".   simplifies to : @xmath106 we immediately note that it is equivalent to calculating the correlation function from the numerator and denominator .",
    "therefore it is enough to express purity @xmath99 directly in spherical harmonics and treat it as denominator , take the measured correlation function and treat it as numerator and finally apply the mathematical formalism described in this work to obtain the correlation function corrected for purity .",
    "the method presented in this paper has been successful applied to the femtoscopic correlation functions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it should be possible to apply it to other fields as well , however one has to take into account limits of the method applicability .",
    "the basic formula   is strictly correct mathematically only if one uses an infinite number of @xmath2 components for all the functions @xmath34 , @xmath56 and @xmath58 . in practical application",
    "one needs to limit oneself to a specific value of @xmath22 .",
    "this is only allowed if the higher @xmath22-moments are negligible .",
    "the femtoscopic correlation function is very well suited to the method because the intrinsic symmetries of the pair distributions limit the relevant @xmath22 components to a practical maximum of 6 .",
    "most important information is contained in @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 components .",
    "we have shown that the method remains stable for any reasonable acceptance hole in @xmath70 region .",
    "it is also clear that the method will start breaking down only for really small values of @xmath110 acceptance and in the extreme case of the `` hole '' taking up the whole @xmath110 acceptance the method will simply break down due to lack of data .",
    "the method in effect interpolates the correlation function in the region where there is no data by assuming certain symmetries in the underlying pair distribution .",
    "using the method described here for femtoscopy , acceptance holes are `` irrelevant '' - any reasonable femtoscopic measurement will have a large enough acceptance to be insensitive to the holes .",
