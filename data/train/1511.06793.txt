    "scattering of the excited electron in a rydberg atom from a neighboring ground state atom can bind the two together to form an ultralong - range rydberg molecule .",
    "the interaction between the excited electron and ground state atom can be described using a fermi pseudopotential that includes both s- and p - wave scattering contributions resulting in a molecular potential that can bind multiple vibrational states with binding energies typically of a few to a few tens of mhz .",
    "such molecules are of interest because they represent a new mechanism for chemical binding and because they possess unusual physical characteristics .",
    "for example , they are very large with internuclear separations comparable to the size of the parent rydberg atoms , i.e. , @xmath2 a.u . , and they can have large permanent electric dipole moments , @xmath3 a.u .",
    ", even in the case of a homonuclear molecule .",
    "while the existence of rydberg molecules was originally predicted theoretically @xcite , they have now been observed using a variety of species including rubidium , cesium , and strontium @xcite .",
    "initial experimental studies involved spherically - symmetric rb(ns ) states and the creation of molecules with small electric dipole moments .",
    "measurements , however , have now been extended to include anisotropic p and d rydberg states @xcite and , using cs(ns ) rydberg states , to the creation of so - called `` trilobite '' states with very large permanent electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "in addition , molecules comprising one rydberg atom and up to four ground state atoms have been observed @xcite .",
    "one interesting question concerning rydberg molecules relates to their lifetimes and how these compare to the lifetimes of the parent rydberg atoms especially in a dense background gas .",
    "earlier studies @xcite using rubidium rydberg molecules demonstrated that the natural lifetime of the parent rb(35s ) atoms , @xmath4 , is significantly longer than that of the molecules and that the lifetime of the molecules themselves depends on their vibrational states , the lifetime of the @xmath5 state , @xmath6 , being substantially shorter than that of the ground @xmath7 state , @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior was attributed to the presence of a strong p - wave shape resonance in low - energy electron scattering from rubidium , which causes a sharp decrease ( step ) in the molecular potential for internuclear separations , @xmath9 , ( for 35s states ) below @xmath10 rubidium molecular states bound by quantum reflection at this step or in local minima at larger internuclear separations can still penetrate to short range through imperfect reflection or tunneling , leading to a reduced natural lifetime .",
    "a similar p - wave resonance exists for cesium , although its effects on molecular lifetimes have not been examined .",
    "a significant density dependence in the loss rates for rubidium molecules was also observed , the cross section for loss in collisions with neutral rubidium atoms being comparable to the geometric size of the molecule itself .    in the present work we have measured the lifetimes of the @xmath7 , 1 , and 2 vibrational states of strontium rydberg molecules together with the lifetime of the parent @xmath11 rydberg atoms .",
    "strontium is attractive for studies of rydberg molecules because , at least for the even isotopes , spectral complexities associated with the rydberg electron spin - orbit and ground - state hyperfine interactions are absent .",
    "furthermore , there is no p - wave scattering resonance which simplifies the molecular potential curves and eliminates the potential step seen in rubidium ( and cesium ) permitting more direct comparison between theory and experiment . in marked contrast to the earlier results for rubidium",
    ", we observe that the lifetime of the parent rydberg atom is essentially equal to that of the @xmath7 and @xmath5 molecular rydberg states , although the lifetime of the @xmath12 state is somewhat shorter .",
    "we also observe that collisions lead to only a small density dependence in the lifetimes of these states .",
    "the production of long - range rydberg molecules requires ultracold temperatures to ensure that thermal energies are small compared to the molecular binding energies .",
    "furthermore , high density samples are required to ensure a sizeable probability for finding two atoms with separations comparable to the size of the parent rydberg atom .",
    "we satisfy these requirements through use of @xmath13 atoms confined in an optical dipole trap ( odt ) . this isotope is chosen because of its collision properties which are favorable for evaporative cooling and for creation of high - phase - space - density samples .",
    "the cooling and trapping of strontium atoms is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the atoms are held in an odt formed using crossed @xmath14 laser beams each with a @xmath15 diameter of @xmath16 .",
    "the odt typically contains @xmath17 atoms at a temperature of @xmath18 resulting in an average density in the trap of @xmath19 which corresponds to an average interparticle spacing of @xmath20 .",
    "this spacing is somewhat larger than the size of an @xmath21 atom , @xmath22 a.u .",
    "( where @xmath23 , the quantum defect , is 3.371 ) , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the rydberg atoms are created by two - photon excitation via the intermediate @xmath25 state which requires radiation at 689 and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 laser for the first step is tuned @xmath28 to the blue of the intermediate state to avoid scattering from the atomic state and from molecular states to the red of the atomic transition @xcite .",
    "the light at @xmath26 is generated by doubling the output of a fiber - based optical parametric oscillator .",
    "the 319 and @xmath27 laser beams cross at right angles and have orthogonal linear polarizations resulting in excitation of @xmath29 states with @xmath30 .",
    "the number of rydberg atoms / molecules present after excitation is determined using selective field ionization ( sfi ) .",
    "an electric field with a risetime @xmath31 and peak value @xmath32 is applied across the odt and the number of resulting electrons is determined as a function of time , with a bin width of @xmath33 , by directing them to a microchannel plate ( mcp ) .",
    "the population of ground state atoms present in the trap is measured by releasing them from the odt and , after a fall time of @xmath34 , measuring their number by absorption imaging using @xmath35 radiation tuned to the @xmath36 transition .",
    "the observed trap lifetime is @xmath37 , and is limited by collisions with background gas .",
    "the lifetimes of the various states are determined by measuring the time rates of decay of their populations using the procedure outlined in fig .  [",
    "fig : timingdiagram ] . a sample of cold atoms is first loaded into the odt .",
    "rydberg atoms or molecules are then created using the two - photon scheme discussed previously .",
    "the @xmath26 laser is tuned on resonance with the atomic or molecular line of interest .",
    "the output of the @xmath27 laser is chopped to form a periodic train of pulses with a pulse repetition frequency of @xmath38 and pulse durations of @xmath39 chosen to produce @xmath40 rydberg atoms or molecules per pulse .",
    "the odt is turned off during each excitation pulse to eliminate ac stark shifts .",
    "after some time delay , @xmath41 , following the end of the laser pulse the number of surviving rydberg atoms or molecules is determined by sfi . the @xmath26 laser is turned off during this data acquisition period .",
    "following initial loading of a cold atom sample into the trap a series of lifetime measurements are undertaken at @xmath42 intervals over a period of @xmath43 . within each interval",
    ", the time delay @xmath41 is cycled repeatedly through a preselected pattern of values ranging from 0 to @xmath44 in @xmath45 intervals and the sfi spectra for each delay time are accumulated .",
    "this methodology eliminates systematic errors that might result from slow changes in the ground state atom population in the trap during the course of a lifetime measurement . during each interval ,",
    "the density only changes by @xmath46 and is treated as a constant for the analysis of our data .",
    "in the course of a measurement we sample the density dependence of the atomic / molecular lifetime over a density variation of about an order of magnitude .",

    "figure  [ fig : uvspectrum ] shows a representative atom / molecule excitation spectrum .",
    "three prominent excitation peaks are evident to the red of the parent rydberg peak .",
    "the widths of these features , @xmath48 , is determined principally by the width of the @xmath26 laser .",
    "the most tightly bound of these features at a detuning of @xmath49 corresponds to the production of rydberg ( dimer ) molecules in the ground @xmath7 vibrational state .",

    "the binding energies can be calculated , as described elsewhere @xcite , with the aid of a two - active - electron ( tae ) model and first - order perturbation theory that utilizes a fermi pseudopotential and effective s- and p - wave scattering lengths to describe the interaction between the excited rydberg electron and ground state atom . the calculated molecular potential within this level of approximation , together with the @xmath7 , 1 , and 2 vibrational wave functions ,",

    "additional more - weakly - bound dimer states are predicted and visible in the spectrum but their small signal strengths precluded measurement of their lifetimes .",

    "a delay time @xmath55 was used to minimize the effects of blackbodyradiation(bbr)-induced transitions to neighboring levels .",
    "the data sets are normalized to the total number of atoms / molecules to emphasize the differences in their shapes .",
    "the atomic spectrum peaks at a field of @xmath56 consistent with the adiabatic ionization of @xmath53 states for which the threshold field is given approximately by @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , the sfi spectra for the molecular states are broader than that of the parent rydberg atom . while the origin of this difference is not the primary focus of this paper , attempts to explain the results by expanding the molecular electronic wavefunction in terms of atomic states with different values of @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , and which ionize at different field strengths , were unsuccessful because the contributions from such states proved to be negligibly small @xcite .",
    "the data , therefore , suggest that electron scattering from the neutral atom during the ionizing field ramp influences the ionization process , a hypothesis that might be tested in the future by pushing to higher trap densities and by measuring sfi spectra for trimer and tetramer rydberg molecules .",
    "the evolution of the sfi spectra with increasing delay time is shown , on a logarithmic scale , in fig .",
    "[ fig : varydelaytime ] .",
    "for the parent @xmath53 atoms the size of the main central peak decreases rapidly with increasing delay time @xmath41 .",
    "at the same time several pronounced features appear on both the high and low field sides of the parent feature .",
    "these peaks are associated principally with population of neighboring @xmath61 states through bbr - induced transitions .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath62 are indicated in the figure . since p states are being continuously generated from the parent state and since tae calculations indicate that their lifetimes are approximately three times longer than that of the parent state , their populations decrease less rapidly than that of the parent state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varydelaytime ] , similar behavior is seen for the @xmath7 molecular state although the high - field bbr - induced features are more difficult to discern due to the sizeable high - field shoulder present in the sfi spectra .",

    "the voltage range of the integration was chosen to minimize the contribution to the integrated signals from the underlying p states while maintaining a reasonable signal level .",
    "tests revealed , however , that expanding the integration range to encompass each entire peak resulted in less than a 6% reduction in the measured decay rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : stateevolution ] shows the time evolution of the number of surviving parent @xmath53 rydberg atoms and molecular @xmath7 , 1 , and 2 , vibrational states for an average cold atom density of @xmath63 .",
    "each of these populations decays essentially exponentially and the corresponding decay rates @xmath64 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : decayvsdensity ] together with those measured at other trap densities .",
    "loss of parent rydberg atoms / molecules from the main peak can result from radiative decay , from bbr - induced transitions to neighboring states , and from collisions .",

    "while the experimental uncertainties make it difficult to obtain an accurate measure of this dependence , the data suggest that the density dependences are similar for all the vibrational levels and point to an `` averaged '' collisional loss cross section @xmath79 .",
    "collisional loss is not unexpected for molecules given that an additional destruction channel is available , namely collisions involving the weakly - bound neutral atom .",
    "this cross section for collisional loss , however , is smaller than the geometric sizes of the molecules inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefunctions ] , @xmath80 .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior seen with rubidium @xmath81 molecules where the cross section for collisional destruction was comparable to the geometrical size of the molecule .",
    "a clear understanding of the mechanisms leading to the destruction of rydberg molecules is lacking but our measurements suggest that , for rubidium , the strong p - wave electron scattering resonance plays an important role .",

    "while the lifetimes of the parent rydberg atoms and the molecular @xmath7 and 1 states are very similar , that of the @xmath12 molecular state is @xmath85 shorter .",
    "this behavior contrasts markedly with that seen for rubidium , and it can be explained by noting that , as shown in fig .  [ fig : wavefunctions ] , for strontium the lack of a p - wave resonance leads to a sizeable repulsive barrier in the molecular potential that limits the close approach of the constituent atoms .",
    "the @xmath12 molecular state does , however , penetrate closer to the rydberg core than do the lower - lying states which might open up additional short - range loss channels . at small internuclear separations simple perturbation theory based on a fermi pseudopotential is no longer appropriate and calculations become more difficult . since bbr - induced transitions populate neighboring rydberg states , the decay of the total population in all rydberg levels is governed simply by radiative decay and collisions . given the relatively long lifetime of the @xmath61 states populated by bbr , radiative decay of the @xmath86 state",
    "will , at least at early times , be the dominant radiative loss process and the overall decay rate can be written approximately as @xmath87 measurements of the decay of the total rydberg populations undertaken by integrating over the full electric field range shown in fig .",

    "the present measurements show that , as compared to rubidium , the lifetimes of the low - lying vibrational states in ultralong - range strontium rydberg molecules are much closer to those of the parent rydberg atoms and display a much weaker dependence on the vibrational quantum number @xmath98 .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of the p - wave scattering resonance ( or lack thereof ) in governing the behavior of rydberg atoms and molecules in dense gases . additionally , the lifetimes of the strontium molecular states are much less sensitive to collisions with ground state atoms .",
