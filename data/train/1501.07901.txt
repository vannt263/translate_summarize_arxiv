    "[ fig : gap_renorm ] . the inter - impurity renormalizations have both terms that depend on the relative orientation of the two spins ( parallel for @xmath141 , antiparallel for @xmath142 ) , as well as orientation - independent contributions .",

    "the upper ( lower ) sign applies for parallel ( antiparallel ) impurity spin alignment .    besides addressing the gap renormalization at the sites of the impurities , it is also interesting to analyze the scaling of the different contributions to the gap renormalization as a function of the inter - impurity distance in their middle , that is at @xmath147 .",
    "the single impurity contributions are found to scale as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the superconducting coherence length .",
    "this scaling has a simple geometrical interpretation : to leading order in @xmath150 , the anomalous green s function ( which determines the gap ) is renormalized by the electron traveling from @xmath151 to impurity @xmath27 at @xmath152 , scattering there , and coming back to @xmath151 .",

    "the total distance covered during these processes , precisely equal to @xmath154 , determines the argument of the exponential .",
    "the leading order inter - impurity terms , on the other hand , are found to scale as @xmath155 since they stem from an electron traveling first to impurity one , then to impurity two , and then coming back .",
    "this involves three trips , and a total distance of @xmath156 .",
    "the inter - impurity renormalization @xmath140 is thus suppressed by an additional power of @xmath157 in between the impurities as compared to its value at one of the impurities , see eq .  .",
    "consequently , the inter - impurity gap renormalization @xmath140 can be modeled as a function with well - defined peaks close to the two impurities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_renorm ] .",
    "we also confirm numerically that the renormalizations of the superconducting gap is the largest directly under the impurity , while , depending on parameters , @xmath158 could even get _ larger _ than its initial value around the impurities , see fig .",
    "[ cross_section ] .",
    "we finally note that the regime @xmath159 is qualitatively similar to the regime @xmath160 .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ two_impurity]b , which is not far from this point .    with increasing exchange strengths , a similar transition as before between shiba and andreev states",
    "can also be observed in the case of two impurities , see fig .",
    "[ two_impurity]b .",
    "when the two impurities are close and with comparable exchange strengths , the bound states overlap and their degeneracy gets lifted by hybridization ,  @xcite which in turn gives rise to two separate quantum phase transitions in @xmath161 , one at @xmath85 and one at @xmath88.@xcite similarly , we find now two distinct shiba to andreev state transitions around these values of exchange strengths , see fig .",
    "[ two_impurity]b .",
    "some illustrative plots of the corresponding wavefunctions are given in fig .",
    "[ two_impurity_numerical ] .",
    "the spectroscopic signatures of the shiba to andreev transition are now even more drastic than for the single impurity case . as shown in fig .",
    "[ two_impurity_numerical]b , the bound state wavefunction of two strongly localized , but hybridized shiba states is strongly suppressed between the impurities . in stark contrast ,",
    "the wavefunction of the andreev bound state spreads between the impurities , and is even maximal between the impurities for the chosen aprameters , see fig .",

    "quite naturally , the gap renormalization resulting from two very close classical impurities with @xmath69 and @xmath170 is thus equal to the renormalization of a single impurity with @xmath171 .",
    "provided that @xmath172 and @xmath173 have the same sign , the superconducting gap is reduced the least if the two spins are aligned antiparallel for short distances . as a final remark",
    ", we note that our non - selfconsistent analytical approach is also able to tackle the regime of intermediate impurity distances @xmath159 . in this regime",
    ", we find some lengthy equations that simply connect the limits of small and large impurity distances in a smooth fashion . as an illustration",
    ", we refer the reader to the numerical plots in fig .",
    "[ two_impurity]b .",
    "these are not far from the regime @xmath159 , and even treat the gap self - consistently .",
    "analyzing two classical spins in a superconductor , we obtained the gap renormalization analytically for weakly and numerically for strongly coupled bound states .",
    "in addition , we found a transition for shiba to andreev states which is accompanied by two subsequent quantum phase transitions as the exchange coupling is varied .",
    "all these predictions lead to dramatic spectral changes . in order to observe these effects by stm tecniques,@xcite it would be preferable to control experimentally the exchange interaction parametrized by @xmath174 .",
    "this can be realized for example by considering a 2d electron gas ( with immersed magnetic impurities ) deposited on top of a bulk superconductor such that the sc gap is now a proximity gap .",
    "we propose to bring an stm tip on top of a magnetic impurity in order to locally control the impurity density of states without affecting its spin and therefore to continuously monitor the parameter @xmath174 .",
    "a number of additional directions can be envisioned in future work . instead of investigating the physics associated with large impurity spins , for which a classical treatment is appropriate",
    ", one could generalize our work the limit of small impurity spins , for which kondo physics becomes relevant at low temperatures . with two close - by impurities ,",
    "this could for instance lead to interesting multi - stage screening effects .",
    "another promising generalization is offered by the use of more exotic superconductors , such as @xmath175-wave materials , where impurities induce virtual bound states @xcite .",
