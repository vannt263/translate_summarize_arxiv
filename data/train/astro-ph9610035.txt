    "clustering properties have been studied basically using the two point correlation function .",

    "the important features of this kind of non gaussian distribution are the index of the scaling laws and not the amplitudes at every scale and we analyse it using a mathematical tool which is most suitable for their determination .",

    "in fig .  [ f1 ] we show the visual similarity between the distribution of two different physical quantities : the redshift distribution of hi column densities in a quasar spectrum and the kinetic energy dissipation in a fully developed turbulent fluid .",
    "the energy transfer , underlying the phenomenon shown in fig .",
    "[ f1]b , can be described by means of a self  similar cascade with an associated multiplicative process : a break  down of large  scale structures into small  scale ones , each receiving a fraction of energy . an analogous mechanism ( for instance in a cdm scenario with an associated  inverse cascade \" of gravitationally confined structures ) can leads to the phenomenon shown in fig .",
    "the result is an intermittent process , where rare events ( the localized peaks , or singularities , in the distribution ) have a higher probability to occur with respect to a gaussian process .",
    "every scaling process , like turbulence and hi column density distribution in the early universe , can be treated in the context of the fractal formalism or , more generally , the multifractal formalism .",
    "a multifractal is a scale - invariant distribution described by a local exponent @xmath0    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the probability measure in the @xmath7th interval of size @xmath8 around the point @xmath9 . in a multifractal",
    ", @xmath0 depends on the position @xmath9 . to investigate the multifractal structure of the measure",

    "the information relative to the multifractal structure can be recognized by calculating the generalized rnyi dimensions @xmath11 from the scaling law :    @xmath12^{(q-1)d_q}\\ ] ]    for the way the partition function is defined , big values of @xmath13 emphasize the scaling properties of overdense regions , while small values those of underdense regions .",
    "a multifractal structure is a non homogeneous fractal ( with different @xmath11 at every @xmath13 ) where the presence of clusters is enhanced by positive values of @xmath13 and that of voids by negative values .",
    "the two point correlation function describes clustering at the first order only , while the infinite set of singularities , each being characterized by a different fractal dimension @xmath11 , describes clustering at every scale and has the important property to show ( in principle ) the _ entire hierarchy of clusters _ ( if any ) .",
    "we have used in a previous paper ( carbone & savaglio , 1996 , hereafter cs96 ) the high resolution spectrum of q@xmath14 ( @xmath15 , cristiani et al .",
    "1995 ) in order to test the multifractality of the forest . for each scale @xmath16 ( between two redshifts @xmath17 and @xmath18 )",
    "we define a probability measure by dividing the redshift range into disjoint subsets @xmath7 .",
    "this measure @xmath19 is defined as the total hi column density in the @xmath7th subset characterized by a velocity separation @xmath16 , normalized to the total column density in the spectrum .",
    "this can be related to the probability of occurrence of a certain amount of gas in the @xmath7-th box at a certain scale @xmath16 .",
    "the results for @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident the presence of two regimes with a linear relation and two different @xmath21 values .",
    "the separation between the two regimes occurs at @xmath22 , which at a mean redshift of @xmath23 corresponds to a comoving scale of about 8 @xmath24 mpc .",
    "similar features are visible for higher values of @xmath13 up to @xmath25 ( cs96 ) .    for comparison with the distribution of galaxies in the local universe , one can see martinez et al . 1990 , coleman & pietronero 1992 , borgani et al",
    ". 1994 , martinez & coles 1994 and garrido et al . 1996 . in the multifractal analysis of the qdot redshift survey of 2086 iras galaxies ( dominated by spiral galaxies ) ,",
    "martinez & coles ( 1994 ) found multifractality and observed two regimes for different values of @xmath13 . for @xmath20 , at small scales ( @xmath26 mpc ) they found scaling properties with correlation dimension @xmath27 , which in one dimension corresponds to a fractal dimension of 0.25 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "for large scales , the iras galaxies reach homogeneity .",
    "we notice that we are comparing the distribution of galaxies of the local universe with that of clouds at high redshift . if the change of regime occurs at similar comoving scales",
    ", we conclude that clouds have undergone a faster clustering evolution compared to iras galaxies .",
    "however multifractality in galaxies is matter of controversy and it is strongly dependent on the galaxy morphology .",
    "the statistics of the forest is poor in comparison with galaxy surveys .",
    "one of the main problems is thus to test the significance of the results .",
    "a first check has been presented in cs96 .",
    "the observed distribution has been compared with a set of 2000 `` fake '' distributions . in a following work ( savaglio & carbone , in preparation ) ,",
    "new tests will be presented and sets of different simulations will be compared to the observed distributions . as very preliminary and crude results ,",
    "we have seen that in 100 simulations of the q@xmath14 sight ",
    "line , 53% of the cases shows no scaling law , 37% one single scaling law with @xmath29 . in 10% a very weak double scaling law , with @xmath21 which goes from about 0.6 at small scales to about 0.8 at large scales and a correlation length much smaller than the observed one .",
    "even if a genuine multifractality in the  clouds distribution is evident , a richer sample of lines and comparison with simulations would help to clarify this situation .",
    "we applied the box  counting method to a sample of qso spectra .",
    "it represents part of the sample used by cristiani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , with a total of 2412 lines for 12 sight  lines .",
    "the redshift coverage is @xmath30 and the resolution better than 15 , the best available for these sources .",
    "the lower limit for the redshift is imposed by the lack of statistics of hst high resolution data .",
    "we restricted our analysis to high resolution spectroscopy in order to minimize the problem of line blanketing ( the confusion of lines ) which at high redshift can dramatically affect the analysis .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm    the partition functions with @xmath20 for the 12 forests are shown in fig .",
    "we confirm the presence of two regimes in almost all of them , except for one object ( @xmath31 ) , where we do not see any clear scaling law in the distribution . for two objects ( @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 ) the determination of the two scales is particularly difficult . for the remaining 9 objects , two slopes are clearly visible . in the plot of @xmath21 as function of the mean redshift for the two different scales ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) there is no correlation for large scales , with a mean value of 0.8 .",
    "this value is an indication that homogeneity has been reached in the sample . for small scales",
    "there is a clear deviation from homogeneity .",
    "a weak correlation with redshift of @xmath21 , being smaller for lower redshifts , can also be noticed .",
    "a more clear redshift evolution is shown by the distribution of the correlation lengths ( fig .",
    "a simple fit with a power law gives :    @xmath34    these results suggest a picture where an initial homogeneous distribution of gas clouds or mass in the universe is broken by process of fragmentation ( in a cold dark matter scenario ) or of aggregation of matter around some singularities ( in the hot dark matter scenario ) .",
    "the ultimate fate of both the processes is a highly intermittent distribution like that shown in fig .",
    "the work presented here is in progress .",
    "a more extended analysis , with a full description of different methods testing the stability of the results , will be presented elsewhere . even if the main problem is the lack of statistics",
    ", we can firmly conclude that multi - scaling analysis of forests is a very promising approach to the study of the large scale structure of the universe at high redshift and its evolution .",
    "this has to be regarded as a parallel and complementary point of view with respect to the study of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the two point correlation function analysis can be replaced by different statistics which are more suitable to describe highly inhomogeneous distributions .",
    "clouds have shown scaling laws for much larger scales with respect to previous analysis , around 10 @xmath35 mpc in comoving distance at redshift of about @xmath36 . for larger scales ,",
    "we have no indication against a homogeneous distribution .",
    "the multifractal properties of a sample of 11 quasars show evolution with redshift . in particular both the amplitude and the strength of the multifractality decrease with redshift , which is what one expects to see in a universe where gravitational clustering gives rise to larger , correlated structures .",
