    "the distributional properties of asset price increments are important both from a theoretical point of view , for understanding market dynamics , and for numerous applications , such as the pricing of derivative products and value - at - risk estimations , in which distributional assumptions play a crucial role .",
    "these applications , and many others , involve different time horizons , ranging from a few minutes , the typical timescale on which market transactions take place , to several months which is the time horizon portfolio managers are concerned with .",
    "this requires knowing the distributional properties of price increments at various time scales .",
    "the problem of comparing the distributions of price changes at various time scales is also interesting from a fundamental point of view . indeed , as we explain below , whereas studying the distribution of increments on a single timescale can not distinguish between a process with independent increments and one with dependent increments , studying the deformation of the distribution under a change of time scale provides insight into the dependence structure of the time series .",
    "we will further elaborate on this point in section 5 .",
    "many studies have been conducted on the distributional properties of asset prices and returns ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "however most of these studies focus on the distributional properties of returns where @xmath4 is the logarithm of the price . in this study however , we have chosen to focus instead on the properties of price increments : @xmath4 is taken to be the price of the asset at date @xmath5 . ] for a given value of the timescale @xmath6 , using daily , weekly or monthly data for example .",
    "mandelbrot was the first to emphasize the idea of comparing the distributional properties of price changes at different time scales @xcite .",
    "the idea behind mandelbrot s approach is that of _ scale invariance _ :",
    "the distribution @xmath7 of price changes on a time scale @xmath3 may be obtained from that of a shorter time scale @xmath8 by an appropriate rescaling of the variable :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the self - similarity exponent .",
    "the simplest scenario of a scale invariant price process is that of a _ lvy flight _ : a random walk with _",
    "increments having a stable lvy distribution@xcite .",
    "this was indeed the solution proposed by mandelbrot @xcite . in this case , if the increments have a @xmath11-stable lvy distribution then the process is self - similar with exponent @xmath12 .    in the recent years",
    "the availability of high frequency financial data has rendered possible the study of price dynamics over a wider range of time scales .",
    "several studies have been done in a spirit similar to that of mandelbrot @xcite in the quest of self - similarity in financial time series , on the s&p 500 index @xcite and on the cac40 ( paris stock index ) @xcite .",
    "this scale invariant behavior , observed for short time scales ( up to 1000 minutes in @xcite ) , breaks down for longer time scales @xcite .",
    "explanations for these observations have been given in terms of _ truncated lvy flight _ models@xcite .",
    "while inspired by the above approaches , the present study has a different aim : we argue that the existence of non - linear correlations and anomalous scaling indicate that simple random walk models may be insufficient for modeling finer aspects of price fluctuations . without assuming any scale _ invariance _ or self - similarity property , we attempt to characterize the deformation of the probability density function @xmath7 under a change of time scale @xmath3 by studying the _ scaling behavior _ of its variance and its kurtosis , showing that their scaling properties deviate from that of an _ iid _ random walk .",
    "knowledge of the scale dependence of distributional properties of price changes enables us to extract more information on the dynamics of series than studying it on a single time scale , providing information about the dependence structure of the increments : in particular , we show that a link can be established between the scaling behavior of the cumulants and high - order correlation functions of the time series .",
    "the study has been conducted on a high frequency data set of s&p index future prices between october 1991 and september 1995 .",
    "there are four maturity dates each year for s&p futures contracts and market activity is most intense for the contract closest to its maturity .",
    "we have constituted our data set by recording for each period the price of the s&p futures contract which has the greatest liquidity among all contracts traded in the market , using the above criterion : @xmath4 is the price of the ( unique ) futures contract maturing less than three months from @xmath5 .",
    "the procedure of sticking together various price series may artificially introduce price jumps at the maturity dates .",
    "the presence of these jumps may in turn influence various statistical estimates such as the variance or kurtosis .",
    "to avoid this , we have shifted all prices in the next data set by a constant so as to equalize the last price of a given set with the first price of the next one , thus eliminating these jumps .",
    "prices of adjacent contracts are shifted by a constant value such that there is no jump between adjacent prices at maturity dates . since our study focuses on statistical properties of price _",
    "differences _ , shifting adjacent prices by the same constant has no effect whatsoever on our results .    prices are recorded at 5 minute intervals , the price retained being the last price recorded during the corresponding 5-minute interval .",
    "the data set thus constituted contains more than 75 000 prices . throughout the article , time is given in multiples of @xmath13 5 minutes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "n = 84 corresponds to a working day , n=420 to a regular working week .",
    "the size of our data set enables us to study timescales ranging from 5 minutes ( n=1 ) up to a few days ( n= 200 ) .",
    "estimates for the longest time scale ( n=200 ) thus correspond to averages over a sample of size @xmath15 3500 , enabling large sample approximations to be used .",
    "let @xmath16 be a smooth , positive function with the property @xmath17    if @xmath18 is a sample realization of a random variable @xmath19 the kernel estimator @xcite defined by @xmath20 gives a smooth estimator of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the variable x. we have calculated a kernel estimator for the pdf of the distribution of the 5 minute price changes using a gaussian kernel i.e. @xmath21 , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the non - normal character of the distribution is better illustrated when it is compared to a gaussian curve with same mean and variance , also shown in figure 1 .",
    "this impression is confirmed upon calculating the excess kurtosis @xmath22 of the distribution ( see section 4 ) : @xmath23 .",
    "this leptokurtic character of price changes is a constant feature of high frequency data .",
    "another feature of high frequency data is that drift effects are negligible compared to fluctuations i.e. the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation is very small .",
    "this ratio is found to be @xmath24 in our case : price variations due to drift are roughly a thousand times smaller than those due to volatility - fluctuations around the mean value @xmath25 .",
    "therefore for practical purposes the distribution may be considered as centered around zero as long as the time scales @xmath3 considered are such that @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 3 months .",
    "we calculate for each time scale @xmath28 the following quantities :    @xmath29 ^ 2 } \\\\",
    "\\kappa(t ) & = & \\frac{{\\overline } { [ \\dx - { \\overline}{\\dx}]^4 } } { \\sigma(t)^4 } - 3   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the symbol @xmath30 denotes a sample average :    @xmath31    @xmath32 is an estimator of the variance of the distribution @xmath2 and @xmath33 an estimator of the _ kurtosis _ , the kurtosis of a random variable @xmath19 being defined as :    @xmath34 } { e [ ( x - e(x ) ) ^2 ] ^2 } - 3\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath35 denotes expectation value ) defined such that @xmath36 for a gaussian random variable .    going from a shorter time scale @xmath6 to a longer time",
    "scale @xmath37 formally corresponds to summing @xmath38 random variables :    @xmath39    if increments are stationary and independent , the distributions for various timescales are simply related by a convolution relation :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 denotes convolution.one can then deduce simply from this relation that for a stochastic process with _ iid _ increments with finite variance , the variance of the distribution at scale @xmath14 increases linearly with @xmath38 and that the kurtosis decreases as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "more generally if @xmath43 is the k - th semi - invariant or cumulant @xcite of the distribution @xmath44 then the normalized cumulants    @xmath45    tend to zero for large n , which is another way of seeing the central limit theorem : the cumulants of order @xmath46 of the limit distribution are all zero , a property which characterizes the gaussian distribution .",
    "for example the skewness @xmath47 decreases as @xmath48 . note that @xmath49 is the kurtosis @xmath50 of the distribution @xmath51 .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the price of an asset has independent increments .",
    "however , it is now known that the independence of increments is not a necessary condition for the central limit theorem to apply @xcite : some types of dependence structures still allow for convergence to the gaussian distribution as @xmath52 in which case the distribution will resemble more closely a gaussian at longer time scales than at shorter ones and @xmath53 as @xmath52 . however there is no reason anymore for the normalized cumulants @xmath54 to decrease as @xmath55 as in the _ iid _ case : the presence of non - trivial scale dependence , which we term _ anomalous _ scaling , is the signature of a departure from the _ iid _ case .",
    "we have examined the empirical behavior of @xmath56 and @xmath50 : figure 2 .",
    "illustrates the scaling behavior of the variance ; it can clearly be seen that the variance is linear in the timescale i.e. @xmath57 , as it would be for independent increments .",
    "this property illustrates the the additivity of the variances of increments , which is equivalent to the absence of autocorrelation , discussed below .    however if we examine the scaling behavior for higher cumulants of the distribution @xmath2 we notice that their behavior is different than for an _ iid _ random walk .",
    "figure 3 shows the behavior of the kurtosis under a change of timescale . as indicated above , in the case of _ iid",
    "_ increments , the kurtosis decreases by a factor @xmath42 when we multiply the time scale by @xmath38 : @xmath58 . in figure 3 we have given a power - law fit of the kurtosis @xmath50 as a function of the time scale @xmath14 .",
    "we find that @xmath50 decreases more slowly than @xmath42 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "+ in principle one could calculate higher order cumulants of the distribution and examine their scaling properties .",
    "however , the error bar for such calculations increases drastically as we go higher in the order of the cumulants .",
    "it is a well - known fact that price movements in liquid markets do not exhibit any significant autocorrelation : the autocorrelation function of the price changes    @xmath61    rapidly decays to zero in a few minutes : for @xmath62 minutes it can be safely assumed to be zero within estimation errors@xcite .",
    "the absence of economically significant linear correlations in price increments and asset returns has been widely documented ( see @xcite and references within ) and often cited as support for the `` efficient market hypothesis '' @xcite .",
    "the fast decay of the correlation function implies the additivity of variances : for uncorrelated variables , the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances .",
    "the absence of linear correlation is thus consistent with the linear increase of the variance with respect to time scale .",
    "however , the absence of serial correlation does not imply the independence of the increments : it is well known that two random variables may have zero correlation yet not be independent . in the same way",
    ", one may give examples of stochastic processes with uncorrelated but not independent increments .",
    "one example , given in @xcite is the following : let @xmath19 be a random variable uniformly distributed on @xmath63 $ ] and define the discrete time stochastic process @xmath64 by the recurrence relation @xmath65 .",
    "a simple calculation then shows that the increments of @xmath64 are uncorrelated ; however , they are not independent : indeed , they are deterministic functions of the same random variable , @xmath19 .    the simplest non - parametric test of the _ iid _ hypothesis is the sign test : if the increments have the same median value @xmath25 then the number t of values exceeding @xmath25 in a sample of size @xmath66 has expected value @xmath67 and the statistic @xmath68 has a standard normal distribution for large samples .",
    "the median @xmath25 is taken to be the sample median , zero in this case .",
    "we calculate the sign statistic @xmath69    for tick data , 5 minute price changes and 30 min price changes .",
    "the interval between ticks is irregular and depends on market activity but it is less than one minute .",
    "the results are the following : @xmath70 assuming that the sign statistic has a n(0,1 ) distribution and using a confidence interval of two standard deviations , the results show that although the signs of price movements at very short time resolutions ( less than a minute ) are significantly correlated , they can be safely considered as independent ( as far as the sign test is concerned ) for time scales beyond 30 minutes .",
    "even for 5 minutes @xmath71 is close to 2 standard deviations .    from a formal point of view",
    ", independence is characterized by the fact that for any ( measurable ) functions @xmath72,@xmath73 the quantity    @xmath74 - e[f(x ) ] e[g(y)]\\ ] ]    vanishes i.e. the variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 are uncorrelated for any non - linear functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , @xmath77 : applying any non - linear function to an independent sequence gives an uncorrelated sequence . in our case this means that increments are stationary and independent if and only if for any function @xmath72 the series @xmath78 is serially uncorrelated .",
    "this criterion indicates a simple non - parametric way of testing the hypothesis of _ iid _ increments : for a given function @xmath72 we calculate    @xmath79    formally , @xmath80 corresponds to a resummation of a certain subclass of correlation functions of the increments @xmath81 , with weights corresponding to the taylor coefficients of @xmath72 .",
    "we use the following non - linear test functions : @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in each case",
    "we calculate the autocorrelation of the series @xmath84 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 5 .",
    "it can be seen that the series @xmath85 and @xmath86 exhibit slowly decaying serial correlations , showing the presence of nonlinear dependence in the data .    to obtain a more detailed picture of the dependence structure of the increments ,",
    "we proceed to calculate higher order correlation functions .",
    "it is well known that the square of the returns -or any other measure of the amplitude of fluctuations for example the absolute value of the increments- exhibits significant autocorrelation .",
    "figure 6 compares the autocorrelation of the price changes to that of their absolute value .",
    "in contrast to the autocorrelation function of the increments which decays rapidly to zero in a few minutes , the autocorrelation of their absolute value decays slowly to zero while staying positive , indicating persistence in the scale of the fluctuations , a phenomenon which can be related to the well known `` clustering of volatility '' .",
    "another measure of the scale of the fluctuations os given by the square of the increments ; figure 7 displays the autocorrelation function @xmath87 of the square of the increments , defined as :    @xmath88    fitting @xmath87 by an exponential gives very bad results ; however the slow decay @xmath87 is well represented by a power law :    @xmath89    the exponent @xmath90 and the constant @xmath91 being obtained by a regression of @xmath92 against @xmath3 .",
    "we will see in the following section that this approximation is precise enough to finely capture the scaling behavior of the kurtosis .",
    "the results of the two preceding sections may be blended into a consistent picture of the dynamical properties of the price process by remarking that the scaling behavior of the semi - invariants of the increments is related to their correlation structure .",
    "there is a simple , well - known example of relations between correlation functions and scaling behavior : the relation between the variance of a sum and the covariance of the addends .",
    "the variance at time scale @xmath37 may be expressed as    @xmath93\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is the autocorrelation function of the increments , defined above .",
    "therefore implies @xmath95 .",
    "the absence of autocorrelation implies linear scaling of the variance .",
    "a similar relation may be derived between the scaling behavior of the kurtosis and the autocorrelation of the square of the increments ( the function @xmath73 defined above)@xcite . using the results above",
    ", we model the signs of the successive price changes as an independent sequence with zero mean , independent from their absolute value . using these hypotheses the fourth moment",
    "may be expressed in terms of the moments and correlation functions of shorter time scale increments @xmath96 ; the calculation , details of which are given in the appendix , gives :    @xmath97    the scaling behavior of the kurtosis is therefore related to the behavior of the correlation function @xmath73 ; if @xmath73 exhibits a slow power law decay @xmath98 then @xmath99 and @xmath100 so :    @xmath101    figure 8",
    ". shows good agreement for large values of n ( @xmath102 ) between the right hand side of the above equation and the kurtosis as a function of time resolution , plotted on the same diagram .",
    "we have thus shown that the anomalous scaling of the kurtosis is well accounted for by the presence of correlations in the scale of the fluctuations , represented by the square of the increments .",
    "by comparing the statistical properties of price increments of s&p index futures at various time scales , we have shown that studying the resolution dependence or _ scaling behavior _ of the variance and the kurtosis of the empirical distribution of price increments enables us to extract much more information than studies on a given time scale .",
    "in particular , the scaling properties of the kurtosis of the price changes may be recovered from the correlation function of their squares , which exhibits a slow power law decay with exponent @xmath103 .",
    "such relations may be generalized to other cumulants and moments but which are less interesting from an economic point of view .",
