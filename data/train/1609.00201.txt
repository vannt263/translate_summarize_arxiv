    "<S> we have determined the magnetic structure of the noncentrosymmetric heavy - fermion superconductor cept@xmath0si using elastic polarized neutron scattering with field - projected ( longitudinal ) xyz polarization analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic moment has components both in the tetragonal basal plane and along the tetragonal four - fold axis . </S>",
    "<S> such a magnetic structure is not symmetry - allowed if the magnetic phase transition is second order , and may imply that cept@xmath0si has lower symmetry in the superconducting state than originally thought .    </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal heavy - fermion compound cept@xmath0si has received strong attention in recent years because it shows unconventional superconductivity despite its noncentrosymmetric crystal structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of inversion symmetry leads to an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling of rashba type , which mixes spin - singlet and spin - triplet cooper - pairing channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition occurs at @xmath1  k , well inside the magnetically ordered state that sets in at @xmath2  k. this suggests that magnetism may play an important role in the pairing mechanism , further highlighted by the fact that the cooper pairs are formed by heavy quasiparticles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic excitations in cept@xmath0si are well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 multiplet of the @xmath4 ce@xmath5 ion is split by the tetragonal point symmetry into three doublets . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet ground state is @xmath6 , as shown by a study combining polarized inelastic neutron scattering with soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main exchange interactions have been determined from the dispersion of the somewhat damped spin - wave excitations in the magnetically ordered phase by unpolarized inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite . above @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> kondo - type spin fluctuations with an anisotropic wave - vector dependence are observed by ins @xcite . as a consequence of the antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the spin susceptibility is anomalous with an orthorhombic anisotropy , as shown by polarized ins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no resonance or any change in the magnetic excitation spectrum is reported in the superconducting state , despite intense search @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic structure of cept@xmath0si is characterized by a propagation vector @xmath8 , but the moment direction is not known . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering measurements show magnetic bragg peak intensity for wavevector transfers @xmath9 , which implies that the ordered moment is not parallel to the tetragonal @xmath10 axis . </S>",
    "<S> it was therefore assumed that the magnetic structure consisted of sheets of collinear moments aligned along an unknown axis in the @xmath11@xmath12 plane , with the sheets stacked antiferromagnetically along the @xmath10 axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on this assumption , the magnitude of the ordered moment was determined to 0.16@xmath130.01  @xmath14 @xcite , substantially reduced from the 1.72  @xmath14 that can be calculated from the ground - state doublet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of the moments lying in the tetragonal basal plane received further support from representation analysis , which showed that for a second - order magnetic phase transition with @xmath8 in the cept@xmath0si space group @xmath15 ( no .  </S>",
    "<S> 99 ) , the moments are either in the basal plane or along the @xmath10 axis @xcite . very surprisingly , the intensities of the magnetic bragg peaks were found to increase substantially on the application of a magnetic field * b * along the [ 001 ] axis @xcite . on the assumption of moments aligned in the basal plane , this suggested that the moment magnitude would double for a field of only 6.6  t along the @xmath10 axis .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the small moment , all magnetic structure determinations in cept@xmath0si are based on elastic neutron scattering measurements on triple - axis spectrometers ( tas ) , a technique that is not very precise in determining moment directions , since it is difficult to normalize the intensities measured on different bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore redetermined the magnetic structure using elastic polarized neutron scattering with field - projected ( longitudinal ) xyz polarization analysis on the in20 triple - axis spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the use of polarized neutrons allows to eliminate the @xmath16-dependent instrumental normalization factors that make unpolarized tas measurements problematic . </S>",
    "<S> we used a standard set - up with heusler monochromator and analyzer and a helmholtz coil at the sample position . to minimize contributions of unpolarized second - order neutrons from the monochromator </S>",
    "<S> , we used an incoming neutron wavevector of @xmath17  @xmath18  and two pyrolytic graphite filters . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was the same image - furnace grown single crystal of mass 6  g used in many of the previous measurements @xcite , mounted with the @xmath11 and @xmath10 axes in the scattering plane ( the lattice parameter are @xmath19 and @xmath20   ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flipping ratio on nuclear bragg peaks exceeded 23 , which makes polarization corrections unnecessary .    </S>",
    "<S> for the determination of the magnetic structure , we measured thirteen magnetic bragg peaks , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with seven different polarized neutron scattering cross - sections @xmath29 : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the incoming and scattered neutron polarization , respectively , the directions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 correspond to the neutron polarization being along * q * , perpendicular to * q * in the scattering plane , and perpendicular to the scattering plane , respectively , and @xmath42 means antiparallel to @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> since neutron scattering observes only the component of the magnetic moment * m * that is perpendicular to * q * , here called @xmath43 , it is straightforward to show that the measured cross - sections @xmath44 are related to the @xmath40 and @xmath41 projected moment components @xmath45 and @xmath46 via @xmath47 the intensities @xmath44 were normalized to the beam monitor , and the background obtained from measurements with the sample rotated away from the bragg position by @xmath48 or in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath49  k was subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral term @xmath50 obtained from ( [ sfxx ] ) is zero within the precision of the present measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected , since the propagation vector of cept@xmath0si does not lead to any chirality .    in the actual geometry of the experiment , with @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> denoting the angle between * q * and the tetragonal basal plane , the magnetic moment components along the crystallographic axes , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , are related to @xmath55 and @xmath56 via @xmath57 and @xmath58 where in the last equality we have assumed real ( fourier components of the ) magnetic moments , which is justified in the case of a @xmath8 propagation vector . by measuring @xmath59 for several inequivalent values of * q * , and hence several values of @xmath51 , both @xmath52 and @xmath54 can be extracted from ( [ eqmy ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the notation @xmath60 for measurements performed at @xmath61 with @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the mixed @xmath63 term can be estimated from the difference @xmath64 within the precision of the measurements , @xmath65 ( see table [ tableresults ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mixed term can also be eliminated from ( [ eqmy ] ) , by taking the average of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> llll moment ratio & spin - flip & non - spin - flip & average + @xmath68 & 0.68(4)@xmath130.03 & 0.62(4)@xmath130.05 & 0.65(3)@xmath130.05 + @xmath69 & 3.2(2)@xmath131.2 & 3.2(2)@xmath130.8 & 3.2(1)@xmath131.0 + @xmath70 & 0.08@xmath130.12 & 0.06@xmath130.11 & 0.07@xmath130.11 +    the ratio of the in - plane components of the magnetic moment are obtained for reflections with @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 averaging over the measured magnetic bragg reflections with @xmath71 , we find @xmath74 for both spin - flip and non - spin - flip cross - sections , and hence @xmath75 ( see table [ tableresults ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the population of in - plane s domains is unequal , and also that the in - plane component of the moment is not along a [ 110]-type axis . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the basal - plane projected moment is either in a general direction with four in - plane s domains or along a [ 100]-type axis with two unequally populated in - plane s domains .    </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - plane moment ratio is obtained from ( [ eqmz ] ) and ( [ eqmy ] ) after averaging over @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath76 bragg peaks , as discussed , @xmath77 using the value of @xmath78 determined above . </S>",
    "<S> note that by normalizing the data to @xmath79 , absorption corrections as well as lorentz and magnetic form factors are factored out . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 , see table [ tableresults ] ) for both spin - flip and non - spin - flip cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the moment component along the tetragonal @xmath10 axis is _ substantial _ , in contrast to assumptions hitherto .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation that the ordered moment direction is neither in the basal plane nor along the tetragonal axis has two important implications . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the field - induced intensity increase of magnetic bragg peaks observed by kaneko _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite can not be directly related to the size of the magnetic moment , since a change in the domain population or a reorientation of the magnetic moment in applied field would also change the bragg peak intensity . for a magnetic field in the [ 001 ] direction , </S>",
    "<S> a domain repopulation is not likely since all s domains have the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the zeeman energy due to the magnetic field will compete with the anisotropy that produces the initial tilt angle of the moment direction , and the total energy of the system will be lowered if the magnetic moments turn further towards the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> such a tilting will increase the intensity of the ( 0,0,1/2 ) bragg peak , as observed experimentally @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second implication is that the magnetic order established at @xmath7 leads to a lower symmetry than expected for a second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the phase transition is either ( weakly ) first order or that there are two phase transitions close to each other near @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> both scenarios lead to a lowering of the symmetry in the magnetically ordered phase , and hence in the superconducting phase , with important consequences for the understanding of the superconducting mechanism . </S>"
