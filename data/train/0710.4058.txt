    "since their introduction , israel layers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite have played an increasingly important role in gravitational physics .",
    "barrabes and israel @xcite began their paper with a description of the israel layer as a thermodynamic phase boundary , but the initial applications of israel layers considered metric matching in dynamic collapse processes involving dust shells , null shells , and cosmic string loops @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "poisson @xcite has summarized some of the early seminal work by israel @xcite,@xcite , barrabes @xcite , de la cruz @xcite , musgrave and lake @xcite , and barrabes and hogan @xcite .",
    "the israel junction conditions @xcite,@xcite find wide application because they provide a simple dynamic boundary description for a variety of scenarios @xcite .",
    "the use of layers as boundaries between standard metrics has been summarized by ansoldi @xcite , and  there is a growing literature that applies the thin shell formalism to new areas such as shell quantum mechanics @xcite - @xcite , layer dimensionality @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , layers in extensions of general relativity @xcite - @xcite and matching in perturbed spacetimes @xcite - @xcite .",
    "astrophysical problems using layers with constant spacetime character continue to be interesting , and include the investigation of collapse @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and new phenomena such as gravastars @xcite - @xcite .",
    "a review of recent layer applications reveals increasingly complex layer models , the gravastar models , for example , involving multi - layer constructions , and there is an increasing interest in describing more realistic layers @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a layer metric is determined by the metrics of the two bounding manifolds .",
    "the stress - energy of the layer is determined by jumps in the extrinsic curvatures of the metrics on either side of the layer .",
    "for example , the israel layer between exterior vacuum schwarzschild and interior minkowski has a 2 + 1 metric as seen from both sides of the layer @xcite @xmath0 the development of @xmath1 tracks the dynamics of the layer and , as in any general relativity solution with stress - energy , the equation of state of the layer is important in characterizing the dynamics .    in this work",
    "we discuss layers which start from rest at infinity in an exterior schwarzschild metric with mass parameter @xmath2 and drop inward along a geodesic .",
    "the lemaitre form of the schwarzschild metric is adapted to this particular geodesic motion but the layer motion can be simply described with the usual schwarzschild metric .",
    "the interior space is schwarzschild with mass parameter @xmath3 .  although the motion of the layer is simple , the equation of state is cubic in the stress , quartic in the density and it provides a new restriction on the range of the stress / density ratio for collapsing layers .",
    "layers with simple motions , such as the layer considered here , can require more physical content than the density and pressure coming from simple perfect fluid or polytropic models .",
    "we quote from @xcite : `` ... models satisfying a closed equation of state are relatively few and essentially restricted to dust or linear barotropic models .",
    "however , it is worth stressing the importance of considering general equations of state in realistic models , describing for instance , very high density regimes for white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "'' layers with physically realistic equations of state are important in studying the collapse scenarios that result in objects like neutron stars .     in the next section",
    "we describe the time development of the radial function , @xmath4 in the exterior schwarzschild metric .",
    "the stress - energy , the equation of state of the layer and its symmetries are discussed in section iii , and we close with a discussion .",
    "extrinsic curvatures are computed in an appendix .",
    "the 2 + 1 layer is bounded by two metrics@xmath5 with + /-",
    "denoting exterior / interior .",
    "@xmath6    the metrics correspond to an @xmath2 schwarschild exterior and an @xmath7 schwarzschild interior .",

    "the velocity of the layer as seen by observers moving with the layer in the bounding spaces is @xmath10 , with corresponding normal vector @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "the velocity normalization imposes the condition    @xmath12    this normalization is used to define function @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath13 is chosen positive with @xmath15 and @xmath16 describing an infalling layer .",

    "with@xmath18 @xmath19 from the velocity normalization .",
    "the metric of the layer from both sides of the boundary is given by eq.([metric-1 ] ) .",
    "in the next section , @xmath1 will be fixed by the requirement of geodesic layer motion in the exterior spacetime . since both sides of the layer will agree on the layer metric",
    ",  this will determine the interior radial function .      for schwarzschild geodesics in the exterior spacetime",
    "we have@xmath20 where @xmath21 describes the initial point of the layer motion .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 corresponds to a layer beginning its inward drop from infinity .",

    "the binding energy of the layer contributes to the value of @xmath2 , as can be seen by eliminating @xmath40 between equations ( [ beta - minus ] ) and ( [ m - l ] ) : @xmath46 the layer mass is not constant due to work done by the stress@xmath47 this has also been noted by carr and yahil @xcite for a self - similar friedman universe and by visser @xcite in dynamic wormholes .      the relation between the density and stress for lemaitre layers is@xmath48 or@xmath49 expression ( [ beta - p - sig ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath50 or@xmath51 eliminating @xmath52 between equations ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ beta - minus ] ) allows @xmath28 to be expressed as@xmath53 substituting for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 above , yields the equation of state for the lemaitre layer @xmath57\\frac{\\sigma^{3}(1 + 4p/\\sigma)^{3}}{(1 + 2p/\\sigma)}. \\label{p - square}\\ ] ] this expression can be rewritten for the density or stress in terms of the ratio @xmath58@xmath59 for a static membrane under tension , @xmath60 is the negative of the sound speed squared , @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath60 ranges of possible interest are    @xmath62    the relative size of @xmath2 to @xmath3 provides three mass regions to consider .",
    "@xmath63 has no extrinsic curvature jumps and no layer.@xmath64for @xmath42 , @xmath41 is required for positive layer density .",
    "this eliminates the positive range of @xmath65 @xmath66 requires @xmath67 and this eliminates the third and fourth region .",
    "region ii is the only allowed range and this sets a new limit on the stress / density ratio for layers collapsing in a schwarzschild geometry .",
    "figure 1 shows the variation of the stress and density in region ii .",
    "a portion of region i has been included for clarity .",
    "[ h ]    fig1.eps    in general the equation of state does not have any of the usual simple forms .",
    "it is a cubic equation in pressure and , depending on the value of @xmath68 can contain simpler equations of state in the root structure . rewriting eq.([p - square ] ) , one finds    @xmath69    the equation of state , eq.([p - bar - cubed ] ) , is plotted in figure 2 showing the regions where , for a single density value , there are three real roots , two real roots , and one real root giving associated values of the pressure .",
    "the negative pressure region corresponds to the layer tension .  in this region , for small density , there are two possible tensions for each value of density while for larger density , there is a 1 - 1 non - linear relationship .",
    "[ h ]    fig2.eps    expanding eq.([p - square ] ) one finds@xmath70 for @xmath71 the equation of state appears approximately polytropic with index @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "layers are most commonly described as perfect fluids or scalar fields . within the perfect fluid models , several eos @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    "have been suggested to analyze the layer stress energy content .",
    "a commonly discussed form is @xmath73 which plays a crucial role in 3 + 1 homothetic solutions @xcite .",
    "the layer is dropping on a schwarzschld / lemaitre geodesic .",
    "the actual equation of state does not change but it can be modeled with simpler forms having time dependent parameters .  this is a different point of view than many dynamic layer treatments which assume a static equation of state and let that drive the layer dynamics .",
    "for example , eq.([p - sigma ] ) for the lemaitre layer implies that @xmath74 changes as the layer drops with the n value given by @xmath75 @xmath74 runs through the range @xmath76 for the positive density layer .",
    "we note that @xmath77 is the dust solution corresponding to @xmath63 , the vanishing layer condition , or to very large @xmath52 .",
    "positive @xmath41 describes an inward moving layer with positive layer density , mass and tension .",
    "the constraint @xmath42 implies that @xmath78 is inside the @xmath79 trapped surface .",
    "the physical picture of the layer dropping inward toward an interior object of mass @xmath3 implies that the layer will cross the @xmath80 horizon .",
    "the value of @xmath60 at the horizon , @xmath81 is parameterized by the ratio @xmath82@xmath83 the maximum value of @xmath84 , @xmath85 occurs for a minkowski , @xmath86 interior , with @xmath84 decreasing as the size of the interior @xmath3 approaches @xmath2 . with @xmath86 ,",
    "the tension of the layer is @xmath87 at @xmath88 , increasing inward to @xmath89 at the @xmath90 singularity .",
    "the layer mass at @xmath88 is less than @xmath2 , since @xmath2 will include the layer binding energy .",
    "the region , @xmath91 describes a layer with negative density and mass and with @xmath92 with @xmath60 positive . for this case @xmath88 lies inside @xmath93 . from eq.([beta - minus ] ) , @xmath94 at@xmath95 .  at this radius",
    ", the layer has infinite tension",
    ".  the interior schwarzschild solution could be the exterior of a third core fluid region with a boundary at @xmath96 , eliminating trapped surfaces from the vacuum motion .",
    "another indication of the complexity of the lemaitre layer is the sound speed ,",
    "@xmath97 using the equation of state , this is@xmath98 @xmath99 is negative over the range @xmath100 indicating instabilities in the layer @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the geodesic collapse of an israel layer in an exterior schwarzschild metric .",
    "the geodesic drop of the layer determines the dynamic development of the layer s motion .",
    "although their geodesic motion is simple , lemaitre layers are physically interesting structures because of their complex equation of state , which can approximate some of the simpler equations of state commonly used in layer dynamics .",
    "some of the simplest equations of state can be described by time dependent models of the actual stress density relation .  a barotropic equation of state is often used to describe israel layers , for example in effective potential treaments @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and discussion of bubble structures @xcite .",
    "in the simple model considered here , the layer can have a time dependent barotropic relation , @xmath101 .",
    "it has an @xmath102 limiting value @xmath103 , with @xmath74 still very small as the layer reaches the @xmath88 surface .",
    "the range of @xmath56 for positive density , has a lower bound of @xmath89 .",
    "this is a new restriction on the range of the stress / density ratio for collapsing layers .",
    "garfinkle and vuille @xcite considered the layer between two schwarzschild metrics with no motion restrictions .",
    "the value @xmath104 was identified as a boundary for their effective potential @xcite , @xcite to have stationary points .",
    "the effective potential for the lemaitre layer is simple with no stationary points or turning points and the boundary @xmath103 occurs at the point @xmath90 .",
    "fluids collapsing along geodesics in a schwarzschild metric have been considered by lynden - bell and lemos @xcite , generalizing the description of a newtonian cold gas collapsing from rest at infinity @xcite .",
    "the collapse of the lemaitre layer and the cold gas have some similarities .",
    "they are both described by the the same @xmath1 and for either case eq.([cap - r ] ) can be written as @xmath105^{3/2}=\\tau_{c}-\\tau_{i}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the proper time to reach @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the time to reach @xmath90 .  in the less limiting case of a newtonian sphere with interior mass @xmath109 , lynden - bell and lemos",
    "show that @xmath108 can be written as a function of the mass@xmath110 where @xmath111 is a constant of integration .",
    "generalizing this relation to einstein s gravity , @xmath112 is identified as a value of special interest corresponding to metric homothetic symmetry .  for the lemaitre layer ,",
    "@xmath108 is just the constant @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 in the cold gas solution .",
    "@xmath108 is related to the time @xmath115 for a layer to reach the @xmath88 surface by @xmath116 the lemaitre layer can be considered as a special member of the @xmath112 , @xmath114 geodesic solutions which include cold gas collapse .",
    "one also notes that the exterior bounding lemaitre metric exhibits second kind kinematic similarity @xcite , reflected by @xmath52(@xmath117 in eq.([cap - r ] ) , which is transferred to the layer and maintained thoughout the motion .    there is growing interest in israel layers as objects of research rather than an aid in matching metrics .",
    "the increasing interest in expanding the physical properties of israel layers has led to descriptions incorporating layer parameters like shell thickness @xcite , @xcite and surface packing fraction @xcite .",
    "while israel layers are still linked to the properties of the two bounding spaces , even simple layers such as the lemaitre layer considered here , require more physical content than the density and pressure coming from simple perfect fluid or polytropic models .",
    "the time dependent models for the actual stress density relations described here , represent one way these simple models can still be used effectively and related to the literature using simple equations of state .",
    "the stress - energy of the layer is determined by jumps in the extrinsic curvatures , @xmath118 of the bounding metrics across the israel layer . the bounding metrics considered here are@xmath119 with ( @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 ) = ( @xmath123 @xmath124 ) .",
