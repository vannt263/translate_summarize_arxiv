    "the thick disk of our galaxy has been extensively studied ( especially in the solar neighborhood ) since it was discovered by @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies have shown that it is a distinct component in a number of ways .",
    "@xcite find that the stellar number density distribution of dwarf stars in the galactic disk found using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data and a photometric parallax method is well fit with a two - component exponential .",
    "the thick disk component is also known to have both a rotational lag and a larger velocity dispersion than the thin disk @xcite giving it a distinct kinematic signature .",
    "it has further been shown to be the dominant component for stars with vertical distances of 1  @xmath2  3  kpc from the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the thick disk is still an unresolved issue , however . using the metallicity and kinematics of sdss stars , @xcite",
    "are able to reproduce the results of previous works , but also caution that there are problems with describing their data using a two - component exponential .",
    "most importantly , they suggest that the metallicity and velocity distributions can be used to describe a single disk component instead of two separate ones .",
    "this would suggest a complex nature to a single disk component and not two distinct disk components with different formations and evolutions .",
    "more recently , @xcite also find that the galactic disk can be represented by a single exponential in the radial and vertical directions that is smoothly varying as a function of age ( by proxy using abundances ) .",
    "this has naturally lead to several competing theories as to the formation mechanism of the thick disk and how it relates to the thin disk .",
    "for example , the thick disk could be mainly composed of accreted stars from previous mergers @xcite , composed of stars formed from accreted gas from previous mergers @xcite , or from the internal mixing of stars and gas within the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these are just a few of the various internal and external sources from which the thick disk of our galaxy could arise .",
    "obviously , a combination of some or all of these scenarios could also give rise to our current galactic hierarchy .",
    "certain well - defined properties of the thick disk should be able to distinguish between these possible scenarios and provide a clearer picture of the formation and evolution of our galactic disk .    in the radial direction ,",
    "metallicity gradients vary from @xmath30  dex  kpc@xmath1 @xcite to + 0.028  @xmath0  0.036 dex  kpc@xmath1 @xcite for stars likely to be thick disk members .",
    "we note that the former uses spectroscopically derived stellar parameters of f- and g - type stars observed by sdss in the range 1  @xmath2  3  kpc while the latter uses photometrically derived stellar parameters of nearby f- and g - type stars .",
    "recent results from the radial velocity experiment ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fall within these two values @xcite .",
    "vertical metallicity gradients of the thick disk show more discrepancy .",
    "@xcite found no variation of metallicity as a function of vertical height . using sdss red horizontal branch stars",
    ", @xcite found a gradient as high as 0.22  @xmath0  0.07 dex  kpc@xmath1 but this result most likely suffered contamination from other galactic sources .",
    "again , the rave results fall somewhere in the middle @xcite as do the results of @xcite who observed stars along two different lines of sight .",
    "our aim in this work is to examine both radial and vertical metallicity gradients of stars associated with the thick disk of our galaxy .",
    "we use the large sample of spectroscopically observed stars from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) made available in sdss data release 8 ( dr8 ) . selecting dwarf stars in this analysis is important since it is the dominant component of the disk of our galaxy .",
    "furthermore , these stars have changed very little since their formation , making them an excellent probe of the condition of our galaxy during the formation of its disk .",
    "we employ various techniques used by previous analyses in order to more easily compare results from different sets of data and using different selection criteria .",
    "the large sample of stars with reliable parameter determinations facilitates this comparison and allows us to give a more comprehensive view of the metallicity distribution of stars up to several kiloparsecs above or below the galactic plane .",
    "spectroscopic data from sdss dr8 @xcite was obtained from the ` casjobs ` interface .",
    "the improvement in dr8 for high - metallicity stars is important for this work since we expect many stars to have abundances near or slightly below solar .",
    "we used the _",
    "segue1_target1 _ flag to select f , g , and k dwarfs ( integer values of 2147483136 , 2147221504 , and 2147450880 , respectively ) .",
    "we require that the stars have clean photometry and reasonable spectroscopic parameters ( wide cuts were applied to eliminate any undetermined or extreme values for the effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and radial velocity ) .",
    "this leaves us with 66,481 out of the total 88,081 stars for these three categories .",
    "further cuts were applied to ensure a clean sample of dwarf stars with good quality observed values and are summarized in table [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "our final sample is 43,417 f , g , and k dwarf stars ( slightly less than half the full sample ) that have well defined photometric and spectroscopic values as well as reasonable proper motions . in figure",
    "[ fig : spatial ] we show the spatial distribution of our dwarf star sample using distances calculated as described below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is some structure to the gradients as a function of radial distance but no obvious trends .",
    "in fact , a single value can describe our results . because the radial metallicity gradient is much smaller ( by an order of magnitude ) than the vertical metallicity gradient",
    ", we can fit the data for stars with radial distances of 7.0  @xmath4  10.5 kpc and vertical heights of 1  @xmath2  3  kpc , which gives us values of 0.113  @xmath0  0.010 and 0.125  @xmath0  0.008 dex  kpc@xmath1 for our full dwarf star sample using isochrone and photometric distances respectively .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the shallower vertical metallicity gradient found by @xcite as well as those given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is slightly steeper than the result of @xcite .",
    "vertical metallicity gradients found using the photometric distance determination are very similar to those found using the isochrone distance determination .",
    "the values from each method agree within errors and there is no obvious systematic difference between the two .",
    "the only discrepancy between the metallicity gradients determined using the different distance estimates is for the bin with 10.0  @xmath4  10.5 kpc , which also has the lowest statistics .",
    "we have probed the metallicity gradients in both the radial and vertical directions using dwarf stars selected from sdss .",
    "we kinematically separate this sample into thin and thick disk components at vertical heights where the two populations are known to overlap using probabilities defined and used in previous analyses .",
    "this is significant because this separation is most often applied to stars in the solar neighborhood , but we have shown that it can be successfully used for sdss data with vertical heights of up to 1  kpc by taking into account the local number density as a function of height .",
    "stars associated with the galactic thick disk have a positive radial metallicity gradient for heights of 1  @xmath2  3 kpc .",
    "our results seem to be at odds with the results of @xcite in the two vertical height bins that overlap .",
    "however , the different populations and selection methods between our work and theirs make it difficult to compare the two results directly .",
    "our results indicate that a radial metallicity gradient determined for stars with @xmath5  1.0 kpc will heavily depend on the fraction of thin and thick disk stars in the sample if the two populations have very distinct values and trends .    when fitting the entire sample of stars with vertical distances most consistent with the thick disk , we find a radial metallicity gradient that is positive and not consistent with zero within errors .",
    "in particular , we find radial metallicity gradients of + 0.025 @xmath0  0.006 ( + 0.019 @xmath0  0.006 ) , + 0.025 @xmath0  0.007 ( + 0.021 @xmath0  0.007 ) , + 0.029 @xmath0  0.010 ( + 0.027 @xmath0  0.008 ) , and + 0.041 @xmath0  0.016 ( + 0.022 @xmath0  0.014 ) dex  kpc@xmath1 using isochrone ( photometric ) distances for stars in 0.5  kpc bins in vertical height between 1  @xmath2  3 kpc and with radial distances of 7.0  @xmath4  10.5 kpc . restricting the fit for the highest vertical height bin to 7.0  @xmath4  10.0 kpc changes the result using isochrone distances from + 0.041 to + 0.023 dex  kpc@xmath1 , which agrees better with lower heights and with the photometric distance determination . to our knowledge , this is the first time that a radial metallicity gradient for the thick disk has been found at these vertical heights .",
    "the values we find are in very good agreement with the old stellar sample value of @xcite and with both of the thick disk f dwarf samples of @xcite .",
    "it also agrees within errors with the results of @xcite . due to the size of our sample ,",
    "our statistical error is smaller than these previous works .    fitting the full sample of stars with radial distances of 7.0  @xmath4  10.5 kpc in the range 1  @xmath2  3 kpc , we find a vertical metallicity gradient of 0.113  @xmath0  0.010 ( 0.125  @xmath0  0.008 ) dex  kpc@xmath1 using isochrone ( photometric ) distances .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite ( among others ) suggests that the galactic disk is a single component that changes smoothly as a function of both radial and vertical distances .",
    "we observe no obvious or significant trends in either the radial or vertical metallicity gradients for stars most consistent with the thick disk of our galaxy .",
    "however , it is not clear if the kinematic selection , distances , and/or bin sizes we have used would be able to detect changes in the metallicity gradient due to such a scenario .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in their work , dividing the disk into components using different methods can give conflicting results , making it difficult to compare the results from geometric , kinematic , and abundance decompositions .",
    "in summary , the metallicity gradients we find in both the radial and vertical directions using the sample of dwarf stars selected from sdss dr8 show no large or obvious trends in the distance ranges we are able to probe .",
    "the vertical metallicity gradient we have found is much steeper than the radial metallicity gradient , but we have found both to be nonzero .",
    "future large spectroscopic survey programs , such as lamost @xcite , should provide greater statistics and more complete samples of stars in a wider range of distances so that metallicity gradients can be probed in more detail and an even better understanding of our galactic disk can be realized .",
