    "the goals of the current and planed set of accelerator - based neutrino experiments  @xcite are the precision measurements of the neutrino mass squared difference @xmath1 by measuring muon neutrino disappearance , and searching for the last unmeasured leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 through the muon to electron neutrino transition .",
    "the last oscillation channel , if it occurs , opens the possibility of observation matter / anti - matter asymmetries in neutrinos and determination of the ordering of the neutrino mass states .",
    "the data of these experiments will greatly extend the statistics due to extremely intense neutrino beamline .    to study the neutrino oscillation effects on the terrestrial distance scale ,",
    "the neutrino beams cover the energy range from a few hundred mev to several gev . in this energy range ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the neutrino - nucleus cross section comes from the charged - current ( cc ) quasi - elastic ( qe ) reactions and resonance production processes .",
    "the cross section data in this energy range are rather scarce and were taken on the targets , which are not used in the neutrino oscillation experiments ( i.e. water , iron , lead or plastic ) . in this situation , the statistical uncertainties should be negligible as compared to systematic errors in the incident neutrino flux , neutrino interaction model and the detector effects on the neutrino events selection and neutrino energy reconstruction . apparently ,",
    "these uncertainties produce systematic errors in the extraction of oscillation parameters .",
    "many experiments try to reduce these uncertainties by using a near detectors .",
    "one of the option for near detector design is to make the near detector as more segmented and fine - grained , using scintillator ( carbon ) as a target and detecting material .",
    "this strategy means that one must try to measure the fluxes and cross sections as independently as possible , and then use this information to constrain the detector simulation so that the information is correctly extrapolated to the far detector .",
    "the concern with this strategy is that the detector simulation must accurately predicted the detector response .",
    "because the near and far detectors are not necessarily of the same target material , a part of the near detector must include some of the same target material , so that nuclear effects on the cross sections ( qe and non - qe ) could be taking into account . among the proposed experiments minerva",
    "@xcite and nd280 detector  @xcite will have the possibility for precise measurements in a wide range of energies and for various nuclear targets .    to model the qe neutrino scattering from a nuclei , the most part of the monte carlo ( mc ) event generators  @xcite are based on the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm )  @xcite with pauli blocking , in which the nucleus is described as a system of quasi - free nucleons with a flat nucleon momentum distribution up to the same fermi momentum @xmath3 and nuclear binding energy @xmath4 . but this model does not take into account the nuclear shall structure , the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the outgoing nucleon and residual nucleus and the presence of short - range nucleon - nucleon @xmath5 correlations , leading to appearance of a high - momentum and high - energy component in the nucleon momentum - energy distribution in the target .",
    "the comparison with the high - precision electron scattering data has shown  @xcite that the accuracy of the rfgm prediction becomes poor at low squared four - momentum transfer @xmath0 , where the nuclear effects are largest .",
    "the modern quasi - elastic neutrino scattering data ( the cc qe event distribution as a function of @xmath0 )  @xcite also reveal the inadequacies in the present neutrino cross section simulation .",
    "the data / mc disagreement shows the data deficit in the low-@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ( gev / c)@xmath7 ) region .",
    "there are many calculations for the qe neutrino charged - current and neutral - current scattering cross sections on nucleus , which go beyond the simple rfgm and use more realistic description of nuclear dynamics .",
    "in calculation of refs.@xcite within the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , the short range @xmath8-correlations were included using the description of nuclear dynamics , based on nuclear many body theory .",
    "charged current and/or neutral current neutrino - nucleus cross sections were studied within the relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) in refs.@xcite , using the relativistic shell model approach and taking into account the fsi effects . in refs.@xcite the contribution of the short range correlations ( src )",
    "was also considered .",
    "the fsi effects were studied in refs.@xcite within the framework of the random phase approximation , in refs.@xcite - within a superscaling approach , and in ref.@xcite - in a gibuu model .    in this paper , we calculate the single - nucleon knockout contribution to the exclusive , inclusive and total cross sections of charged - current qe ( anti)neutrino scattering from @xmath9c , using different approximations ( pwia and rdwia ) and the fermi gas model .",
    "we employ the lea code  @xcite which was adopted for neutrino reactions . in our approach ,",
    "the effect of the scr in the carbon ground state is evaluated in the pwia  @xcite and the fsi effect on the inclusive cross sections in the presence of the @xmath8-correlations is estimated according ref.@xcite .",
    "the aims of this work are a ) calculation the rdwia cc qe @xmath10c cross sections , b ) investigation of nuclear effects on the @xmath0 dependence of the ( anti)neutrino cross section , and c ) comparison of the total cross sections , scaled with the number of neutron / proton in the target for ( anti)neutrino scattering on the oxygen and carbon targets .",

    ".    in the inclusive reactions ( [ qe : incl ] ) only the outgoing lepton is detected , and the differential cross sections can be written as    [ csinc ] @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the inclusive hadronic tensor .",
    "the expressions for the exclusive ( [ cs5 ] ) and inclusive ( [ csinc ] ) lepton scattering cross sections in terms of response functions are given in ref.@xcite .",

    "the model space for @xmath85c@xmath86 consists of @xmath87 and @xmath88 nucleon - hole states in the @xmath89b and @xmath89c nuclei .",
    "the @xmath87 state is regarded as a discrete state even though its spreading width is actually appreciable .    in the independent particle shell model the relativistic bound - state functions @xmath61 in eq.([eq12 ] ) are obtained within the hartree ",

    "it is well known that the dirac spinor @xmath99 can be written in terms of its positive energy component @xmath100 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the scalar and vector potentials for the nucleon with energy @xmath104 .",

    "we use the lea program  @xcite for numerical calculation of the distorted wave functions with edad1 sv relativistic optical potential @xcite for carbon . in the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) the final state interaction between the outgoing nucleon and the residual nucleus is neglected , and the nonrelativistic pwia exclusive cross section has a factorized form  @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the nuclear spectral function . according to the jlab data @xcite",
    ", the occupancy of the independent particle shell model orbitals of @xmath85c equals about 89% , on the average . in this work",

    "we consider the phenomenological model  @xcite where the high - momentum ( hm ) part of the spectral function is determined by excited states with one or more nuclei in a continuum .",

    "the electron and neutrino scattering off the nuclei are closely interrelated and one can treat both processes within the same formalism . in the nonrelativistic pwia , @xmath126 is a nuclear spectral function and should be similar for electron and ( anti)neutrino scattering except small distinctions which can be attributed to the coulomb distortion upon the electron wave function .",
    "the small difference between neutrino and antineutrino is due to difference in the fsi of the proton and neutron with the residual nucleus .",
    "this effect is neglected at the energy beam higher than 1 gev .",
    "there is an overall good agreement between calculated in the rdwia electron and ( anti)neutrino cross sections and data .",
    "apparently the rfgm predictions ( with the fermi momentum @xmath3=221 mev / c and binding energy @xmath4=25 mev ) overestimate the values of cross sections and completely off the exclusive data .",
    "this is due to the uniform momentum distribution of the fermi gas model and neglecting by the fsi effects .",

    "it was shown that the inclusive cc cross sections calculated with only the real part of the optical potential are almost identical those of the green s function approach , in which the fsi effect in the inclusive reactions is treated by means of a complex optical potential and the total flux is conserved . in this work , in order to calculate the inclusive and total cross sections , we use the approach , in which only the real part of the optical potential edad1 is included .    to test our approach , we calculated the inclusive @xmath85c@xmath131 cross sections and compared them with data from slac  @xcite , from saclay  @xcite , and from jlab  @xcite .",

    "we note that , relative to the pwia results , the generic effect of the fsi with the real part of the optical potential is to reduce the cross section value around the peak and to shift the peak toward the lower value energy transfer .",

    "also was shown that at low @xmath1440.1 ( gev / c)@xmath7 the coss sections depend weakly of the values of the axial mass .",
    "the cc qe total cross sections predicted by the rfgm are higher than the corresponding values obtained in the rdwia and this difference decreases with neutrino energy .",
    "the flux - averaged total cross section was calculated within the rdwia approach and compared with the experimental result from the lsnd collaboration .",
    "the calculated cross section is in good agreement with data .",
    "we compared the cc qe total cross sections ( scaled with the number of neutron / proton in the target ) for ( anti)neutrino scattering on the oxygen and carbon targets and found that the cross sections calculated within the rdwia for oxygen , are lower than those calculated for carbon , and the src effects increase this difference .",
    "we conclude that the data favor the rdwia results .",
    "this indicates that the use of rdwia in monte carlo simulations of the neutrino detector response would allow one to reduce the systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation parameters .",
