    "at extremely high temperatures and/or densities , the quark matter is expected to turn into new phases .",
    "clarification of the nature of these states as well as the phase structure of qcd is important in understanding the evolution of the universe around microseconds to milliseconds after the big bang . here , the only method to obtain information about the quark matter directly from the first principles of qcd is to numerically study qcd based on monte carlo simulations on the lattice . in the study of lattice qcd with dynamical quarks ,",
    "the boltzmann weight is proportional to the quark determinant . at nonzero chemical potentials",
    ", however , the quark determinant becomes complex and causes a serious problem  the monte carlo procedure is not justified because of the complex boltzmann weight . in the low density region , because the fluctuations of the complex phase are small , we can avoid the problem by the reweighting method in which the complex phase is treated as a correction factor of the observables ( reweighting factor ) . using the reweighting method",
    ", we can also vary coupling parameters of the system by absorbing the difference of the boltzmann weight at different coupling parameters into the reweighting factor .",
    "this is powerful in a study of the phase structure in which a survey over a range of coupling parameter space is mandatory .    at higher densities , however , larger fluctuations of the complex phase introduce two severe difficulties .",
    "one is the sign problem . because of large fluctuations of the complex phase in the reweighting factor",
    ", exponentially large statistics is required to obtain reliable estimates for the reweighted observables .",
    "several methods have been proposed to remedy or mitigate the sign problem @xcite .",
    "another problem is the overlap problem .",
    "when we try to shift simulation parameters largely by the reweighting method , the reweighting factor tries to enhance part of the boltzmann weight whose statistical quality is low .",
    "this can be easily seen by viewing the boltzmann factor in terms of the histogram for relevant observables .",
    "when expectation values of observables vary largely with the shift of the simulation parameters , the reweighting factor has to enhance part of the histogram far from the original peak position .",
    "because it is statistically quite hard to achieve highly accurate details of the histogram around such a point , the reweighting method may lead to completely unreliable results ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "this makes it difficult to study high density qcd , in which the transition is expected to be of first order and thus expectation values can jump largely around the transition point .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the overlap problem .",
    "the overlap problem is expected to be milder if one changes a couple of parameters at the same time . in an early trial to identify the critical point in a high density region of qcd @xcite , fodor and katz shifted the chemical potential and the gauge coupling ( temperature ) simultaneously along the crossover curve to achieve a better overlap ( multiparameter reweighting method ) .",
    "more recently , the whot - qcd collaboration investigated the phase structure of @xmath2-flavor qcd in the heavy - quark region and found that the system at large quark masses is controlled by only two combinations of parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gauge coupling , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hopping parameter and chemical potential for the @xmath8 th flavor , and @xmath9 is the temporal lattice size @xcite .",
    "this means that , when one changes the coupling parameters while keeping these combinations constant , the system does not change and thus the overlap problem does not arise . we expect that similar combinations of parameters also exist in the light - quark region .    in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the multipoint reweighting method @xcite for @xmath0 played an important role : combining configurations obtained at different @xmath0 , we could calculate the effective potential in a wide range of the observable values , which was mandatory in a reliable evaluation of the transition point .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the multipoint reweighting method to the multiparameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath6 , and test if the method helps to overcome the overlap problem in the light - quark region , performing simulations in a simpler case of zero - density qcd .",
    "we measure histograms of physical quantities at a series of simulation points in two - flavor qcd and apply the multipoint reweighting method to calculate the meson masses as continuous functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we then determine lines of constant physics in the @xmath10 space and evaluate the derivatives of the lattice spacing with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 along the lines of constant physics ( inverse of the beta functions ) , which are needed in a calculation of the equation of state at finite temperature .    in the next section ,",
    "the multipoint reweighting method is introduced , and in sec.[sec : overlap ] , we examine the overlap problem by performing numerical simulations in two - flavor qcd .",
