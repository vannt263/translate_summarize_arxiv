    "almost forty five years ago feynman , kislinger , and ravndal noticed  @xcite that the regge spectrum of meson and baryon masses could be universally described by assuming the four - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential acting between quarks and antiquarks . during subsequent years",
    "the idea of four - dimensional harmonic oscillator re - entered the discussion about quark confinement several times in various ways .",
    "leutwyler and stern developed the formalism devoted to the covariant description of bilocal meson - like fields @xmath3 combined with the idea of harmonic confinement  @xcite .",
    "considerations of paper  @xcite and leutwyler - stern formalism  @xcite can be seen as the forerunners to at present time very popular soft wall ads / qcd models  @xcite and the light front holographic qcd  @xcite . in recent years , the approaches to confinement based on the ideas of soft wall ads / qcd model and light front holography demonstrated an impressive phenomenological success  @xcite .",
    "the crucial for phenomenology features of these approaches are the particular dilaton profile @xmath4 and the harmonic oscillator form of the confining potential as the function of fifth coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "all these approaches begin with different motivation but finally come to the schrdinger type differential equation with the harmonic potential in @xmath5 defining the wave functions and mass spectrum of mesons and baryons .    the physical origin of the above - mentioned particular form of dilaton profile in ads / qcd and light front holography as well as the harmonic potential in the stern - leutwyler studies and , hence , the laguerre polynomial form of the meson wave functions , could not be identified within these approaches themselves .",
    "the preferable form of the dilaton profile and/or the potential are determined by the phenomenological requirement of regge character of the excited meson mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the approach presented in this paper has been developed in essence twenty years ago  @xcite .",
    "it clearly incorporates the idea of harmonic confinement both in terms of elementary color charged fields and the composite colorless hadron field .",
    "the distinctive feature of the present approach is that it basically links the concept of harmonic confinement and regge character of hadron mass spectrum to the specific class of nonperturbative gluon configurations  almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields .",
    "a posteriori a close interrelation of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields and the hadronization based on harmonic confinement can be read off the papers  @xcite . in brief , the line of arguments is as follows ( for more detailed exposition see  @xcite ) .",
    "an important benchmark has been the observation of pagels and tomboulis  @xcite that abelian self - dual fields describe a medium infinitely stiff to small gauge field fluctuations , i.e. the wave solutions for the effective quantum equations of motion are absent .",
    "this feature was interpreted as suggestive of confinement of color .",
    "strong argumentation in favour of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous field as a candidate for the global nontrivial minimum of the effective action originates from the papers @xcite .",
    "in particular , leutwyler has shown that the constant gauge field is stable ( tachyon free ) against small quantum fluctuations only if it is abelian ( anti-)self - dual covariantly constant field @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative calculation of the effective potential within the functional renormalization group @xcite supported the earlier one - loop results on existence of the nontrivial minimum of the effective action for the abelian ( anti-)self - dual field .",
    "the eigenvalues of the dirac and klein - gordon operators in the presence of abelian self - dual field are purely discrete , and the corresponding eigenfunctions of quarks and gluons are of the bound state type .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that these operators contain the four - dimensional harmonic oscillator , acting as a confining harmonic potential .",
    "eigenmodes of the color charged fields have no ( quasi-)particle interpretation but describe field fluctuations decaying in space and time .",
    "the consequence of this property is that the momentum representation of the translation invariant part of the propagator of the color charged field in the background of ( anti-)self - dual abelian gauge field is entire analytical function .",
    "the absence of pole in the propagator was treated as the absence of the particle interpretation of the charged field  @xcite .",
    "however just the absence of a single quark or anti - quark in the spectrum can not be considered as sufficient condition for confinement .",
    "one has to explain the most peculiar feature of qcd  the regge character of the physical spectrum of colorless hadrons .",
    "usually regge spectrum is related to the string picture of confinement , justified in two complementary ways and limits : classical relativistic rotating string connecting massless quark and antiquark , and the linear potential between nonrelativistic heavy quark and antiquark with the area law for the temporal wilson loop as a relevant criterion for static quark confinement . neither the homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual field itself nor the form of gluon propagator in the presence of this background had the clue to linear quark - antiquark potential . nevertheless , the analytic structure of the gluon and quark propagators and assumption about the randomness of the background field ensemble led both to the area law for static quarks and the regge spectrum for light hadrons .",
    "randomness of the ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields has been taken into account implicitly in the model of hadronization developed in  @xcite _ via _ averaging of the quark loops over the parameters of the random fields .",
    "the nonlocal quark - meson vertices with the complete set of meson quantum numbers were determined in this model by the form of the color charged gluon propagator .",
    "the spectrum of mesons displayed the regge character both with respect to total angular momentum and radial quantum number of the meson .",
    "the reason for confinement of a single quark and regge spectrum of mesons turned out to be the same  the analytic properties of quark and gluon propagators .    this result has almost completed the quark confinement picture based on the random almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields .",
    "self - duality of the fields plays the crucial role in this picture .",
    "this random field ensemble represents a medium where the color charged elementary excitations exist as quickly decaying in space and time field fluctuations but the collective colorless excitations ( mesons ) can propagate as plain waves ( particles ) .",
    "it should be stressed that in this formalism any meson looks much more like a complicated collective excitation of a medium ( qcd vacuum ) involving quark , antiquark and gluon fields than a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical bound state of charged particles ( quark and anti - quark ) due to some potential interaction between them . within this relativistic quantum field description the regge spectrum of color neutral collective modes appeared as a `` medium effect '' as well as the suppression ( confinement ) of a color charged elementary modes .",
    "however , besides this dynamical color charge confinement , a correct complete picture must include the limit of static quark - antiquark pair with the area law for the temporal wilson loop . in order to explore this aspect an explicit construction of the random domain ensemble",
    "was suggested in paper  @xcite , and the area law for the wilson loop was demonstrated by the explicit calculation .",
    "randomness of the ensemble ( in line with @xcite ) and ( anti-)self - duality of the fields are crucial for this result .    in this paper",
    "we briefly review the approach to confinement , chiral symmetry realization and bosonization based on the representation of qcd vacuum in terms of the statistical ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields , systematically calculate the spectrum of radial meson excitations and their decay constants and outline the possible relation between the formalism of soft wall ads / qcd and light - front holography , and this , at first sight , different approach .",
    "the character of meson wave functions in hadronization approach  @xcite is fixed by the form of the gluon propagator in the background of the specific class of vacuum gluon configurations .",
    "these wave functions are almost identical to the wave functions of the soft wall ads / qcd with quadratic dilaton profile and leutwyler - stern formalism . in all three cases",
    "we are dealing with the generalized laguerre polynomials as the functions of @xmath5 . in the hadronization approach of @xcite and",
    "@xcite the fifth coordinate @xmath5 appears as the relative distance between quark and antiquark in the center of quark mass coordinate system , while the center of mass coordinate @xmath6 represents the space - time point where the meson field is localized .",
    "this treatment of coordinates goes in line with the leutwyler - stern approach .",
    "comparison of the soft wall ads / qcd action and the effective action for auxiliary bilocal meson - like fields of the hadronization approach hints at the link between very appearance of dilaton and its particular profile and the form of nonperturbative gluon propagator .",
    "the strictly quadratic in @xmath5 dilaton profile corresponds to the propagator in the presence of strictly homogeneous ( anti-)self - dual abelian gluon field that is an idealization of the domain wall network background with infinitely thin domain walls .",
    "these three approaches can be considered as complementary to each other ways to describe confinement in terms of meson wave functions . however , unlike two other approaches bosonization in the background of domain wall networks relates the form of meson wave functions to the particular vacuum structure of qcd and provides one with the manifestly defined meson effective action that describes strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions of mesons in terms of nonlocal vertices given by the quark - gluon loops .",
    "new results for mass spectrum and decay constants of radially excited light , heavy - light mesons and heavy quarkonia are presented .",
    "an overall accuracy of description is 10 - 15 percent in the lowest order calculation achieved with the minimal for qcd set of parameters : infrared limits of renormalized strong coupling constant @xmath7 and quark masses @xmath8 , scalar gluon condensate @xmath9 as a fundamental scale of qcd and topological susceptibility of pure qcd without quarks .",
    "this last parameter can be related to the mean size of domains .",
    "it should be noted that the present paper also completes and clarifies the studies of @xcite in two important respects : diagonalization of the quadratic part of the meson effective action with respect to radial quantum number , clarification of the physical meaning of the quark mass parameters in the context of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by the background field and four - fermion interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section_domain_wall_network_as_vacuum ] is devoted to motivation of the approach .",
    "derivation of the effective meson action is considered in section [ section_domain_model ] .",
    "results for the masses , transition and decay constants of various mesons are presented in section [ section_masses_of_mesons ] . in the section [ discussion ] we outline possible relation between the present hadronization approach and the formalism of the soft wall ads / qcd model , light front holographic qcd ,",
    "compare the quark and gluon propagators of the present approach with the results of functional renormalization group ( frg ) and dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) .",
    "important technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "the primary phenomenological basis of the present approach is the existence of nonzero condensates in qcd , first of all  the scalar gluon condensate @xmath9 . in order to incorporate this condensate into the functional integral approach to quantization of qcd one",
    "has to choose appropriate conditions for the functional space of gluon fields @xmath10 to be integrated over ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . besides the formal mathematical content",
    ", these conditions play the role of substantial physical input which , together with the classical action of qcd , complements the statement of the quantization problem . in other words , starting with the very basic representation of the euclidean functional integral for qcd , @xmath11\\},\\ ] ] one has to specify integration spaces @xmath12 for gluon and @xmath13 for quark fields .",
    "bearing in mind a nontrivial qcd vacuum structure encoded in various condensates , one have to define @xmath12 permitting gluon fields with nonzero classical action density , @xmath14 it is assumed that the constant @xmath15 may have a nonzero value .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath16 that satisfy this condition have a potential to provide the vacuum with the whole variety of condensates .",
    "an analytical approach to definition and calculation of the functional integral can be based on separation of modes @xmath17 responsible for nonzero condensates from the small perturbations @xmath18 .",

    "quite reliable argumentation in favour of ( almost everywhere ) homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields as dominating vacuum configurations was put forward by many authors  @xcite . as it has already been mentioned in introduction , nonperturbative calculation of qcd quantum effective action within the functional renormalization group approach @xcite supported the one - loop result @xcite and indicated the existence of a minimum of the effective potential for nonzero value of abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous gluon field .     between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field and the mixing angle @xmath25 in the cartan subalgebra .",

    "nonzero scalar gluon condensate @xmath27 postulated by the effective potential @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a scale of qcd and @xmath30 , leads to the existence of twelve discrete degenerate global minima of the effective action ( see fig.[effpotxiomega ] ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the self - dual and anti - self - dual field respectively , matrix @xmath34 belongs to cartan subalgebra of @xmath35 with six values of the angle @xmath36 corresponding to the boundaries of the weyl chambers in the root space of @xmath35 .",
    "the minima are connected by the parity and weyl group reflections .",
    "their existence indicates that the system is prone to the domain wall formation . to demonstrate the simplest example of domain wall interpolating between the self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian configurations , one allows the angle @xmath37 between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields to vary from point to point in @xmath38 and restricts other degrees of freedom of gluon field to their vacuum values . in this case",
