    "the nonclassical polarization states of light have recently been the subject of a number of theoretical and experimental papers in the framework of quantum information @xcite .",
    "polarization squeezing was first discussed by chirkin @xcite .",
    "this theoretical proposal used the nonlinear cross kerr ( @xmath3 ) effect with special requirements on the nonlinear coefficients to achieve noise reduction in polarization variables , i.e. the stokes operators .",
    "the first experimental realization of polarization squeezing @xcite used an elegantly simple scheme where a squeezed vacuum was spatially overlapped with an orthogonally polarized strong coherent beam on a 50:50 beamsplitter .",
    "this experiment sought to map the polarization state of light , an information carrier , onto the spin state of a macroscopic atomic ensemble , which could be used as a quantum memory or as a quantum information processor @xcite . prior to this experiment in the late 80 s",
    ", the combination of squeezed vacuum and coherent beam of orthogonal polarization was used to enhance the sensitivity of a polarization interferometer for high precision phase measurements @xcite . however , at that time the nonclassical polarization properties of the light field used were not recognized and results were attributed to the sub - shot - noise vacuum input , i.e. single - mode quadrature squeezing .",
    "the interest in nonclassical polarization states has grown recently motivated by : 1 ) the demonstration of the mapping of quantum state of light onto atoms @xcite ; 2 ) the recognition that the stokes operators as conjugate variables which can all be measured in direct detection , rendering local oscillator methods unncessary @xcite ; 3 ) the presentation of the concept of and the criteria for the experimental verification of continuous variable polarization entanglement @xcite .",
    "a straightforward experimental scheme for the generation of polarization squeezing and entanglement of intense beams was suggested in @xcite .",
    "polarization squeezed light is generated by phase - locking two orthogonally polarized intense amplitude squeezed beams .",
    "continuous variable polarization entanglement emerges from the linear interference of two polarization squeezed beams . in both schemes , the required nonclassical resources can be reduced to as few as one amplitude squeezed beam by substituting coherent or vacuum beams for the others . depending on the particular combination",
    ", this degrades the degree of squeezing or entanglement",
    ". this deterioration may be weaker when using low intensity squeezed light @xcite rather than intense squeezed beams ( see results in this paper ) .",
    "using such low intensity beams , polarization squeezing of continuous wave beams was recently generated exploiting an optical parametric amplifier @xcite and was extensively experimentally characterized @xcite . in this paper we present results of a polarization squeezing experiment with pulsed light and",
    "devote special attention to the definition of polarization squeezing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "2 briefly introduces the relevant polarization variables , the stokes operators .",
    "the notion of polarization squeezing is also discussed and its specific properties are compared to conventional quadrature squeezing using practical examples .",
    "sec . 3 provides a detailed description of the experimental setup .",
    "4 presents the experimental results on polarization squeezing using intense pulses .",
    "two different beam combinations are considered which lead to the generation of distinct nonclassical two - modes states : 1 ) a linearly polarized intense amplitude squeezed beam is combined with a vacuum resulting in sub - shot - noise stokes variances but not in polarization squeezing ; and 2 ) polarization squeezed light emerging from the combination of two orthogonally polarized intense amplitude squeezed beams .",
    "is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the classical stokes parameters are a well known description of the polarization state of light @xcite . of interest to this paper",
    "are their quantum counterparts . in direct analogy to the classical parameters , we find that the quantum stokes operators are @xcite and references therein : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the photon annihilation and creation operators of two orthogonal polarization modes x and y. @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the photon number operators of these modes and @xmath9 is the total number operator .",
    "the @xmath10 operator corresponds to the beam intensity whilst @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the polarization state .",
    "the @xmath0 operator commutes with the others : @xmath14 = 0 , \\quad j = 1,2,3 ,    \\label{eqn : stokes_commutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the remaining operators obey the su(2 ) lie algebra , as indicated by the commutator : @xmath15 = 2i\\hat{s}_3 ,    \\label{eqn : stokes_commute}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the cyclics thereof .",
    "these non - zero commutators imply the impossibility of simultaneous exact measurement of the operators .",
    "it is worth noting that the commutators are operator valued .",
    "the commutation relations here are similar to those for spin @xmath16 particles and this fact has already been experimentally leveraged in the mapping of the quantum polarization state of light onto an atomic spin system @xcite . as a result of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_commute ] ) uncertainty relations in the variances of the operators arise : @xmath17 here @xmath18 refers to the variance @xmath19 of the stokes operator @xmath20 .",
    "a useful aid in visualizing a polarization state and its uncertainties is the quantum poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath21 this differs from the classical definition @xcite in the 2@xmath0 term which is a result of the non - commutation of the stokes operators . on the poincar sphere uncertainty regions",
    "are depicted as volumes about the mean values of the operators , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gen_poincare ] .",
    "the modes depicted there are : 1 ) a spherical uncertainty volume of radius @xmath22 centered on the radial value of @xmath23 representing an arbitrarily polarized coherent beam ; 2 ) a cigar shaped uncertainty which is squeezed below the shot noise in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and anti - squeezed in @xmath24 depicting an arbitrarily chosen polarization squeezed beam .",
    "a particular advantage of the stokes operators is that they can be directly measured using only linear optical elements thereby avoiding local oscillator methods @xcite .",
    "the required setups are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stokes_detect ] .",
    "measuring the difference channel in balanced detection gives the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "addition of a half wave - plate such that the incoming polarization is rotated by 45@xmath25 allows for the measurement of the @xmath2 operator .",
    "introduction of a quarter wave - plate to the @xmath2 setup such that the wave - plate s axes coincide with those of the polarization beam splitter permits measurement of the @xmath24 parameter .",
    "the @xmath0 operator is found in all three setups by simply measuring the sum channel , though the first is taken as the standard .",
    "this freedom arises from the fact that @xmath0 represents the total intensity ( c.f .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_def ] ) ) and as such is constant for all configurations .",
    "the three operator valued commutation relations of the stokes operators make the definition of polarization squeezed states such as that in fig .  [",
    "fig : gen_poincare ] non - trivial .",
    "in contrast to the quadrature operators @xcite , the coherent polarization state is not simultaneously a minimum uncertainty state ( mus ) for all stokes operators . considering the stokes uncertainty relations in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_uncertainty ] ) , the mus is represented by an equality sign `` = '' in place of the `` @xmath26 '' :    @xmath27    the mean values of the third stokes operator on the right of the equations indicate the state dependence of the mus of the other two operators .",
    "that is , the specific form of the uncertainty relations and the mus are determined by the particular polarization state under consideration .",
    "as we investigate the definition of polarization squeezing let us first consider the quadrature mus , the coherent mode : @xmath28 with the stokes variances : @xmath29 this incorrectly leads to what seems to be a natural definition for polarization squeezing in analogy to that for quadrature squeezing : @xmath30 this suggest that a polarization squeezed state is one in which the variance of a stokes operator @xmath20 falls below the variance of an equally intense coherent mode . a polarization state obeying eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coh_polsq_def ] ) is always a nonclassical state and can be used to produce quadrature entanglement . however",
    ", this definition alone implies nothing more than conventional quadrature or single - mode squeezing observed through the measurement of the stokes parameter .",
    "the correct definition of polarization squeezing must consider the conditions given by the uncertainty relations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_uncertainty ] ) and the mus bounds of eq .  ( [ eqn : stokes_mus ] ) .",
    "these show that the coherent state is not a polarization mus for any pair of stokes operators .",
    "for example , the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coh_polsq_def ] ) can hold simultaneously for a pair of stokes operators for which the uncertainty relations are bounded from below by zero .",
    "they can then both be measured simultaneously and exactly and the usual concept of squeezing is not applicable .",
    "therefore , to define a meaningful nonclassical polarization state the uncertainty relations and the mus must be taken into account .",
    "thus we define a polarization squeezed state as one in which one of the stokes variances lies not only below the coherent limit but also below the respective mus limit ( c.f .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_mus ] ) ) @xcite : @xmath31    in this paper the term polarization squeezing is always used in the strict sense of the above definition , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polsq_def ] ) .",
    "in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coh_polsq_def ] ) this definition is closely related to two - mode squeezing .",
    "note that some papers have used the term in the looser sense of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coh_polsq_def ] ) @xcite",
    ". the implications of the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polsq_def])and its differences compared to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coh_polsq_def ] ) will be further investigated by way of three examples .    before beginning discussion of these examples ,",
    "the amplitude ( @xmath32 ) and phase ( @xmath33 ) quadrature operators should be introduced .",
    "these are useful tools to describe the quantum state of light and are particularly advantageous here as our polarization squeezing is generated from amplitude quadrature squeezing .",
    "thus the operators are @xcite : @xmath34 using the notation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stokes_def ] ) .",
    "these operators obey the uncertainty relation : @xmath35 which implies the impossibility of simultaneous exact measurement of the operators . for easier use of the quadrature operators we can describe the photon operators by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the real , classical amplitude of the mode",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 is the corresponding quantum noise operator with a mean value of zero .",
    "upon substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quadrature_def ] ) we find the quadrature noise operators are : @xmath40 for an amplitude squeezed beam the variance , @xmath41 is decreased relative to the coherent state whilst @xmath42 is increased , or anti - squeezed . using this basis we will now look at three forms of polarization squeezing arising from different combinations of amplitude squeezed and coherent beams .",
    "their investigation will show why for viable application of polarization squeezing of intense light , two amplitude squeezed beams are necessary .",
    "the first case we will examine is that of a single , linearly x - polarized , amplitude squeezed beam combined where the y - polarization mode is represented by a coherent vacuum .",
    "these states are described in the following box :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resultant mean stokes values are : @xmath43 which give rise to identical uncertainty relations as in example 2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ex2_uncertainty ] ) ) .",
    "the normalized stokes variances derived from the two amplitude squeezed beams are : @xmath44 where the variance products are similar to those in example 2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ex2_varproduct ] ) ) .",
    "we have made use of the fact that the beams exhibit identical squeezing : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these results parallel those in example 2 and polarization squeezing as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polsq_def ] ) is again observed in @xmath11 with @xmath24 as its anti - squeezed conjugate .",
    "the important difference here with respect to example 2 is that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are squeezed to the same extent as the individual amplitude squeezed beams .",
    "thus this case holds the most promise for quantum information and so is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "[ fig:3dpoincare ] illustrates the variances of the different polarization squeezed states that have been discussed . the coherent state is represented by the spherical uncertainty volume in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpoincare]a .",
    "the state fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpoincare]b corresponds to the example 1 , an amplitude squeezed beam . as such , only squeezing below the coherent limit is seen and no anti - squeezing is present , indicating no polarization squeezing .",
    "examples 2 and 3 are described by fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpoincare]c , where we see squeezing in @xmath1 and @xmath2 relative the coherent bound .",
    "@xmath1 is polarization squeezed as it is a conjugate variable squeezed below its uncertainty limit , and @xmath24 is correspondingly anti - squeezed .    to maximize the available polarization squeezing in our experiments",
    ", we use the superposition of two amplitude squeezed beams for the generation of polarization squeezed light , as in example 3 . the above calculations",
    "assume a perfect phase alignment between the x- and y - polarization modes .",
    "this raises the question as to what effect an imperfect phase match between the pulses has on the squeezing .",
    "if we assume an angle @xmath47 between the orthogonally polarized modes , they are described by : @xmath48 using this to calculate the stokes operators we find : @xmath49 these give the following mean values : @xmath50 we see that @xmath10 and @xmath11 should be phase insensitive in both mean and noise . however @xmath12 and @xmath13 are phase sensitive , making good phase stability a requirement .",
    "in this work we report on an experiment to produce quadrature and polarization squeezed light beams by spatially overlapping an intense , amplitude squeezed pulse with either a coherent vacuum or another amplitude squeezed pulse .",
    "polarization squeezing was recently implemented using quadrature squeezed cw - light from an optical parametric oscillator @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our work takes advantage of an efficient , pulsed squeezing source afforded by the kerr nonlinearity of a glass fiber @xcite .",
    "the setup used is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : aufbau ] .",
    "the experiment uses a passively mode - locked cr@xmath51:yag laser operated at 1495 nm and a repetition frequency of 163  mhz @xcite .",
    "the maximum average power is 95  mw and the pulses have a bandwidth limited hyperbolic - secant shape with a fwhm of 130 - 150  fs .",
    "these pulses are squeezed utilizing the kerr effect ( @xmath52 nonlinearity ) in an asymmetric fiber - sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "the sagnac loop consists of a 93:7 polarization independent beam splitter and 14.2  m of polarization maintaining fiber with negligible polarization cross - talk ( fs - pm-7811 from 3 m ) , chosen for its small mode diameter and thus high nonlinearity which allows good squeezing at relatively low pulse energy .",
    "the beam splitter divides a pulse into two parts of unequal energy which then counter propagate through the fiber .",
    "the strong pulse experiences the fiber nonlinearity much more intensely than the weak pulse , giving rise to an intensity dependent , nonlinear phase shift . in the single mode picture described in @xcite",
    "this effect squeezes the circular shaped phase space uncertainty into a crescent .",
    "however , reduced amplitude fluctuations can not be observed directly as the deformed uncertainty area is not oriented along the amplitude quadrature direction . upon interference with the counter propagating weak pulse on the beam splitter after exiting the fiber the ellipse is reoriented in phase space . for certain input energies",
    "this realignment yields detectable amplitude squeezing @xcite .",
    "similar to previous experiments by silberhorn et al .",
    "@xcite , polarization maintaining fiber was used in the sagnac interferometer to simultaneously generate two independent , orthogonally polarized , amplitude squeezed pulses .",
    "equal squeezing of these pulses was guaranteed by adjusting the quarter wave - plates in the birefringence compensator , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aufbau ] , which fine tuned the intensity of the two polarization modes going into the fiber . instead of interfering these two squeezed pulses on a beam splitter after rotating one of the polarizations as in @xcite",
    ", we have brought the orthogonally polarized , squeezed pulses to spatial and temporal overlap , thereby generating polarization squeezing .",
    "due to the birefringence of the fiber ( beat length 1.75  mm at 1495  nm ) , a path difference between the polarizations is necessary for successful overlap .",
    "the birefringence compensator accomplishes this by splitting x- and y - polarizations in a michelson - interferometer - like setup , introducing a path difference of 1.2  cm .",
    "coarse adjustment of the delay is realized using a micrometer table ; fine adjustment of the relative phase is achieved by an actively controlled piezo system . placing the birefringence compensator before the sagnac interferometer has the advantage of minimizing losses after the interferometer .",
    "this is important because squeezing is loss sensitive .",
    "the piezo s control loop is based on the back - reflection from the sagnac interferometer .",
    "this reflection consists of two components : 1 ) light reflected from the optical elements without passing through the fiber , and 2 ) light which has passed through the fiber and is returned from the interferometer s beam splitter , which has the same polarization state as the light entering the measurement setup .",
    "these two signals are of approximately equal intensity because the fiber ends are not anti - reflection coated .",
    "the reflected light of 1 ) is linearly polarized in contrast to the slightly elliptical light which exits the fiber , 2 ) . a @xmath24 ( ellipticity ) measurement",
    "is carried out on the back - reflection , and so the reflected light of 1 ) plays no role .",
    "the value of this @xmath24 measurement is minimized by the control loop .",
    "the loop operates up to several tens of hertz , constrained by the piezo .",
    "a pair of balanced detectors with windowless ingaas photo diodes from epitaxx ( etx-500 ) were used to measure the stokes parameters ( cf .",
    "[ fig : stokes_detect ] ) .",
    "saturation of the alternating current ( ac ) amplifier was avoided by suppression of the 163  mhz laser repetition rate and harmonics using a chebyshev low pass filter .",
    "measurements of the variances of the stokes parameters , the sum and difference of the ac signals of the two detectors , were made on a pair of spectrum analyzers .",
    "these were operated at 17.5  mhz where the extinction ratio of the detectors was 30  db . further , a spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth of 300  khz , a video bandwidth of 300  hz and a sweep time of 10  s were used .",
    "the shot noise for each measurement was determined by the direct current ( dc ) signals from the detectors which were simultaneously recorded by a digitizing oscilloscope .",
    "these dc values were summed after taking into account the slight dc gain difference ( 1:1.005 ) . from this value",
    "the corresponding ac noise was derived .",
    "this calculation was based on a linear fit to an ac noise power against dc signal plot for a coherent light beam falling an individual detector .",
    "the result is however not absolutely linear , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : det_nonlin ] . for low input optical powers deviation due to the detector s dark noise and imperfect components was seen . for large input powers",
    "the nonlinear behavior is caused by saturation of the ac amplifier .",
    "thus a fit was made to the middle data region .",
    "for these reasons , this calibration is the largest source of error in the experiment , conservatively estimated to be 0.2  db .",
    "we used the above described setup to investigate the cases outlined in examples 1 and 3 .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : stokes_amp_sq_lin2 ] are for example 1 : a x - polarized , amplitude squeezed pulse combined with a coherent vacuum on the polarization beam splitter in the measurement setup .",
    "as expected , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are squeezed relative the corresponding coherent light limit : by -3.7 and -3.6  db respectively .",
    "however no polarization squeezing as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polsq_def])is seen . the remaining parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are + 0.1  db above the coherent level .",
    "this extra noise is primarily due to the detector and their electronics .",
    "the error on these values is @xmath530.3  db , resulting from the measurement accuracy and the shot noise calculation .",
    "similar results were seen for 45@xmath25 and circular polarized beams , whereby the squeezed parameters were @xmath10 & @xmath12 and @xmath10 & @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the shot noise levels differ slightly between the measurement runs because of laser power fluctuations as well as detuning of the setup , in particular the fiber coupling .",
    "the case outlined in example 3  the overlap of two equivalent , amplitude squeezed pulses  was also experimentally investigated .",
    "the results thereof are dispalyed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_sq_zeit2 ] . in these data",
    "series the relative phase ofthe pulses was locked to @xmath47=0 giving rise to a linearly polarized beam at 45@xmath25 . here",
    "three of the four stokes paarameters are squeezed : @xmath0 and @xmath1 by -3.4  db and @xmath2 by -2.8  db .",
    "@xmath1 is polarization squeezed , as its noise value has been brought under the corresponding minimum bound .",
    "the conjugate anti - squeezed parameter is @xmath24 with a value of + 23.5  db .",
    "it is so large as it also bears the additional phase noise inherent to squeezing in fibers .",
    "it should be remembered that the squeezing in @xmath0 and @xmath2 is only quadrature squeezing .",
    "the general increase in noise for two pulses compared with the single pulse case has three primary roots .",
    "the first is increased sensitivity to slight misalignments and general imperfections in the many wave - plates .",
    "the misalignment of the wave - plates causes a slight mixing of the difference signal parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with each other .",
    "mixing even a small amount of the anti - squeezed parameter , @xmath13 , into the other parameters causes significant squeezing degradation .",
    "the sum signal , @xmath10 , is unaffected by this phenomenon .",
    "secondly , fluctuations in the laser power cause significant noise in all parameters .",
    "this stems from the fact that squeezing is strongly dependent on pulse power . further complicating the matter ,",
    "the four beams coupled into the fiber generally could not be coupled in with identical efficiency giving rise to small squeezing differences between the polarizations .",
    "the third error source , the phase noise , affects @xmath2 and @xmath24 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phase_effect ] ) . whilst @xmath54=0",
    ", there is significant noise on the beam from thermal and acoustic sources which the phase control can not presently cancel .",
    "this error source most greatly affected @xmath12 , which is therefore significantly noisier than the others .",
    "the phase noise was in general amplified by the misaligned wave - plates .",
    "further error sources in the experiment stem from the detectors .",
    "saturation at high intensities was problematic , particularly in the @xmath12 measurement where the entire beam fell upon one detector .",
    "of the two detectors used one had a noticeably higher saturation level and care was taken to illuminate this detector in the @xmath12 measurement . the ac gain difference between the detectors , approximately 1:1.06 , is not negligible . in a numerical simulation , it was seen that this together with small wave - plate misalignment and the phase noise between the pulses produces significant degradation of the detected squeezing .",
    "this effect is strongest for wave - plates standing at 22.5@xmath25 , i.e. for @xmath12 measurements .",
    "quantum information and communication are important fields for the future . due to the ease of detection of the stokes operators",
    ", polarization squeezing will play an important role in the development of these fields , not least as a basis for polarization entanglement .",
    "this paper investigated polarization squeezing of intense pulses using amplitude squeezed pulses generated by the kerr nonlinearity of a glass fiber .",
    "it was seen in three calculated examples that significant squeezing in the stokes parameters requires stable spatial overlap of two amplitude squeezed beams .",
    "this was supported by discussion of experimental results for a single amplitude squeezed beam as well as two overlapped amplitude squeezed beams . in the former only conventional single - mode quadrature squeezing was seen through the stokes operators whereas the latter exhibited polarization squeezing in @xmath1 with @xmath24 as its conjugate variable .",
