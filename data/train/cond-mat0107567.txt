    "similar to monopole and quadrupole breathing modes of a gaseous bose - einstein condensate , scissors modes were first studied theoretically and subsequently observed experimentally .",
    "the scissors modes are , however , rather special since they directly manifest the superfluid behavior of these atomic gases . moreover , the recent experimental studies appear to show a resonance behavior between two coupled scissors modes @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    "this is interesting because a linear - response calculation can neither account for the coupling nor for the resonance behavior .",
    "therefore , a first step towards an explanation of these experimental observations is to perform a calculation that goes beyond linear - response theory and accurately takes into account the mean - field interaction that couples the scissors and breathing modes . in this paper",
    "we present a simple variational method for calculating the frequencies of these various modes and their couplings beyond the linear - response .",
    "we perform our calculation at zero temperature and therefore do not consider the damping rates of the scissors modes .    the main idea behind our method is to use a time - dependent gaussian _",
    "ansatz _ for the groundstate wave function to derive the equations of motion of the breathing modes and the scissors modes .",
    "then we expand the resulting equations of motion in deviations from equilibrium . in first order , i.e. , linear - response , we recover the expected uncoupled set of equations .",
    "the second - order calculation produces a set of coupled equations which show that we need to excite all three scissors modes in order to get a nonzero coupling . at higher orders we , however , find that we only need to excite two modes to get coupling .",
    "furthermore , we actually find under certain conditions a resonance behavior between these two modes .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we rederive in sec .",
    "[ freqs - section ] the frequencies of the scissors modes in the linear - response limit . in sec .",
    "[ heigher ] we extend the calculation first to second , and then also to higher orders , which ultimately lead to a resonant coupling . in sec .",
    "[ solution ] we solve the equations of motion analytically near the resonance using an envelope function approach . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we end with a discussion of our results .",
    "we start by considering a bose - einstein condensate trapped by the following harmonic potential @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the angular frequencies of the trap , and @xmath4 is the atomic mass . a scissors mode in a bose - einstein condensate",
    "is associated with an irrotational flow with a velocity field of the form @xmath5 , if the motion is taking place in the @xmath6-plane @xcite .",
    "similar expressions hold for the two other cartisian planes .",
    "these kind of modes can be excited by a sudden rotation of the equilibrium axes of the trap .",
    "to such a perturbation the condensate will respond by oscillating around the new equilibrium axes .",
    "for example , to excite a scissors mode in the @xmath6-plane , we rotate the @xmath7 and @xmath8-axes of the trap slightly around the @xmath9-axis .",
    "if the angle of rotation is sufficiently small , the scissors mode can be approximated by a simple oscillation of the condensate around the new equilibrium axes .",
    "on the other hand , if the axes change through a large angle this method excites the @xmath10 quadrupole mode , where @xmath4 labels the projection of the angular momentum along the axis of symmetry . the maximum angle for which the scissors mode is defined increases with deformation of the trap @xcite .    to account for all three scissors modes in the three cartisian planes we employ the following trial function for the condensate order parameter @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are complex time - dependent variational parameters and @xmath14{c_{xy , r}c_{xz , r}c_{yz , r}+4b_{x , r}b_{y , r}b_{z , r}-(b_{z , r}c_{xy , r}^2+b _ { y , r}c _ { xz , r}^2+b_{x , r}c_{yz , r}^2 ) } \\label{a}.\\ ] ] this value of the prefactor @xmath15 guarantees the normalization of the square of the wave function @xmath16 to the total number of condensed atoms @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the real parts of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the first set of parameters , @xmath12 , give rise to the well - studied breathing modes which , for axially symmetric traps , are called the monopole and quadrupole modes depending on the value of @xmath4 being equal to zero or two , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 on the other hand determine the three scissors modes .",
    "the equations of motion for these variational parameters can be derived from the lagrangian @xmath20={1\\over2}i\\hbar\\int { { \\rm d}{\\bf r } \\left(\\psi^*({\\bf r},t){\\partial\\psi({\\bf r},t)\\over\\partial t } -\\psi({\\bf r},t){\\partial\\psi^*({\\bf r},t)\\over\\partial t}\\right ) } -e[\\psi,\\psi^ * ] \\label{lagrangian},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is the usual gross - pitaevskii energy functional given by @xmath22=\\int d{\\bf r } \\left [ { \\hbar^2\\over 2m}|{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\psi({\\bf r},t)|^2 + v({\\bf r})|\\psi({\\bf r},t)|^2 + { 1\\over2}t^{2b}|\\psi({\\bf r},t)|^4 -\\mu|\\psi({\\bf r},t)|^2 \\right ] \\label{functional}.\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the two - body @xmath24-matrix , which for the atomic bose - einstein condensates of interest is related to the @xmath25-wave scattering length @xmath26 through @xmath27 .",
    "inserting our trial wave function into the lagrangian and scaling frequencies with @xmath28 and lengths with @xmath29 , it takes the dimensionless form @xmath30/n&=&\\left(\\alpha_{x}{\\dot b}_{x , i}+\\alpha_{y}{\\dot b}_{y , i}+\\alpha_{z}{\\dot b}_{z , i}\\right)/q\\\\\\nonumber & -&{1\\over2}\\left [ \\alpha_{x}(4|b_{x}|^2+|c_{xy}|^2+|c_{xz}|^2)\\right.\\\\\\nonumber & + & \\alpha_{y}(4|b_{y}|^2+|c_{xy}|^2+|c_{yz}|^2)\\\\\\nonumber & + & \\left.\\alpha_{z}(4|b_{z}|^2+|c_{xz}|^2+|c_{yz}|^2)\\right]/q\\\\\\nonumber & -&{1\\over2}\\left[\\alpha_{x}\\omega_{x}^2+\\alpha_{y}\\omega_{y}^2+\\alpha_{z } \\omega_{z}^2\\right]/q\\\\\\nonumber & -&{1\\over2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\gamma\\sqrt{q } \\label{scaled lagrangian } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the dot corresponds to a time derivative .",
    "in addition @xmath35 is the dimensionless parameter that represents the strength of the mean - field interaction . minimizing the lagrangian with respect to the 12 variational parameters",
    ", we get a set of 12 coupled equations of motion .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are rather lengthy and complicated .",
    "a significant simplification takes place if we expand these equations in the deviation of the variational parameters from their equilibrium values , i.e. , in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the yet unknown eigenfrequency of the modes , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the equilibrium values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "these latter values can simply be obtained by setting the time derivatives in the equations of motion to zero . for large condensates in the so - called thomas - fermi regime",
    "we can ignore contributions from the kinetic energy @xcite and the equilibrium variational parameters take the simple form @xmath41 it is required that @xmath42 for the last equation to be valid .",
    "to first order in the deviations the equations of motion read simply @xmath43 where the vector @xmath44 contains all the possible fluctuations , and the matrix @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given explicitly in appendix [ app ] .",
    "it is clear from the last equation that to linear order the breathing modes and scissors modes are uncoupled .",
    "the dispersion relation of these modes can be obtained by setting the determinant of @xmath49 to zero .",
    "this results in @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the zeros of the first three factors in the left - hand side of the last equation give the frequencies of the scissors modes , whereas the zeros of the sixth - order polynomial give the frequencies of the breathing modes .",
    "so far we have not produced a new result , since these frequencies have been calculated previously .",
    "however , we have demonstrated a new way of calculating the frequencies of scissors modes in a relatively simple manner . the most important part of this paper is therefore contained in the next section , where we consider also the nonlinear effects produced by the mean - field interaction .",
    "in this section we consider the equations of motion for the variational parameters by taking into account several higher - order terms in the deviations @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we have calculated these equations analytically up to second order , but they turn out to be rather lengthy and contain terms that couple the breathing modes and the scissors modes . as we discuss below , in the present experiments with axially symmetric traps the coupling of the scissors modes with the quadrupole mode is always of importance , but we leave the treatment of this more complicated situation to future work . for simplicity , therefore , we focus here on triaxial traps , in which case we can ignore the breathing modes .",
    "this is achieved by simply setting @xmath59 in the full equations of motion .    up to second order",
    ", the remaining 6 first - order equations for @xmath60 can be reduced to 3 second - order equations for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 by eliminating the imaginary parts .",
    "we find in detail @xmath64 \\label{c1},\\ ] ] @xmath65 \\label{c2},\\ ] ] and @xmath66 \\label{c3}.\\ ] ] these equations show that if we ignore the second - order terms we recover our previous three uncoupled scissors modes with frequencies @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the coupling terms couple the three scissors modes such that if one mode is not excited the other two modes will not be coupled .",
    "in other words , to get a nonzero coupling up to this order , the three modes must be excited simultaneously .",
    "we believe that this important result is not an artefact of the gaussian approximation , but also holds for an exact calculation using the bogoliubov theory .    for higher - order couplings the last conclusion is no longer true .",
    "two modes can then be coupled , even when the third is not excited .",
    "from now on , therefore , we assume without loss of generality that only the @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes are excited , while @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , to investigate the possibility of a resonant coupling between these two modes , we have considered coupling terms up to ninth order .",
    "similar to the second - order case explained above , the equations of motion can thus be expressed as @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the sum @xmath76 does not excced 9 , which is the order up to which we have chosen to expand the equations of motion .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath78 are given in terms of the trap parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the interaction parameter @xmath79 .",
    "a resonance between these two modes takes place when the frequency of the coupling terms is equal to the frequency of the zeroth - order term , i.e. , the first two terms .",
    "the frequency of each coupling term in the above summations is determined by substituting for @xmath80 and @xmath81 their zeroth - order solutions .",
    "therefore , the latter frequencies will be a certain linear combination of the zeroth - order scissors modes frequencies . imposing the above resonance condition on each coupling term thus results in a relation between the two scissors modes frequencies @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "inspecting all coupling terms up to the ninth order , we found a very small number of terms for which the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be satisfied by real values of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "ultimately , we find only a resonance when either @xmath85 or @xmath86 is satisfied .",
    "the first resonance condition leads in the experimentally relevant axially symmetric case , where @xmath87 , to a value for the anisotropy ratio @xmath88 that is equal to 1 .",
    "this clearly corresponds to a spherically symmetric condensate . since in this case",
    "the scissors modes are degenerate with the quadrupole breathing modes , which we have ignored here , we focus from now on only on the second resonance condition .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the second resonance condition is exactly the same as the one observed experimentally @xcite . for a resonance of this kind the resonant coupling terms turn out to be of seventh order , and",
    "the equations of motion in that case read @xmath89 @xmath90 if we neglect all nonresonant terms . here",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are functions of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath79 that are given explicitly in appendix [ app ] .",
    "it is important to note here that our neglect of the nonresonant terms is justified when we are close enough to resonance .",
    "this is similar to the rotating - wave approximation known from quantum optics .",
    "we see that the coupling terms indeed lead to the above - mentioned resonance condition , by inserting in them the zeroth - order solutions , i.e. , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . for example , the coupling terms in eq .",
    "( [ c1n ] ) have a total frequency of @xmath96 . separating out @xmath97 as a prefactor for the whole equation , the coupling term oscillates thus as @xmath98",
    "therefore , a resonance takes place when @xmath99 , i.e. , when the condition in eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) is met .",
    "similarly , the coupling term of eq .",
    "( [ c2n ] ) is also oscillating with a frequency of @xmath100 .",
    "sufficiently close to resonance we can write @xmath70 and @xmath71 as a product of two functions . one of them describes the slow envelope and the other the fast oscillation with the uncoupled scissors - mode frequency .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the slowly varying envelope functions . substituting these expressions into eqs .",
    "( [ c1n ] ) and ( [ c2n ] ) , ignoring second - order time derivatives of @xmath104 and @xmath103 , and then eliminating @xmath103 , we obtain the following equation for @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 this equation has a solution of the form @xmath107^{1\\over1-\\varepsilon } \\label{sol},\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are two constants of integration that are determined by the initial conditions .",
    "note that the relevant quantity here is @xmath110 , which represents the actual envelope of the oscillation and is given by @xmath111^{1\\over2(1-\\varepsilon)}.\\ ] ] in first instance we might think that the real part of @xmath104 is the relevant quantity .",
    "however , in eqs .",
    "( [ geq ] ) and ( [ feq ] ) we should in principle have taken the real part of the right - hand side . if we do that we automatically are lead to the condition that @xmath110 is the envelope of the oscillation .    for definiteness sake",
    "let us take the initial conditions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "physically , this set of initial conditions corresponds to exciting the scissors modes in the @xmath116 and the @xmath6-planes simultaneously .",
    "this should be performed experimentally by initially rotating the condensate in the @xmath116-plane by an angle @xmath117 and around the @xmath9-axis by an angle @xmath118 and then releasing the condensate .",
    "the initial angles @xmath117 and @xmath118 are related to the constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 by @xmath121 latexmath:[\\[{\\dot f}_{0}={\\alpha\\omega_{xy}^2\\over\\omega_{xz } } ( 2|b_{x}^{(0)}-b_z^{(0)}|\\cos{\\theta_0}\\;\\sin{\\theta_0})^3    conditions the constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given by @xmath123 @xmath124 using these expressions and the experimental parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite , we give in fig . [ 2a ] the real part of @xmath125 .",
    "this clearly shows how the energy is being exchanged between the two modes .",
    "an interesting property of eq .",
    "( [ f2eq ] ) is that exactly on resonance , i.e. , @xmath99 , its solution becomes nonoscillatory .",
    "indeed we find that in this case the solution is @xmath126 where again @xmath127 and @xmath128 are constants that are determined by the initial conditions . for the above initial conditions this is a decreasing function in time .",
    "physically , this means that , unlike the case of an off - resonant oscillation , it takes an infinite time for the energy that is transferred from the scissors mode in the @xmath116-plane to the scissors mode in the @xmath6-plane to get back to the mode in the @xmath116-plane . in fig .",
    "[ 2b ] we show this resonance behavior .",
    "finally , we can show that in the limit @xmath129 the oscillatory solution given in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) reduces to the nonoscillatory one at resonance given by eq .",
    "( [ sol_dec ] ) .",
    "we have explored the role of the mean - field interaction in coupling the three scissors modes of a bose - einstein condensate . a variational approach with a gaussian trial wave function , that contains a number of variational parameters describing the scissors modes ,",
    "provides a relatively simple way in which we can extract the main features of this coupling .",
    "to first order in the deviations in the variational parameters from their equilibrium values we reproduce the correct frequencies of the scissors modes .",
    "to second order we show that it is not possible to have two modes that are coupled if the third mode is not excited . instead",
    ", all three modes need to be excited for nonlinear dynamics to occur .    at higher orders we find that it is possible to couple only two modes . in this case",
    "we find a resonance behavior if @xmath130 or @xmath131 .",
    "up to the nineth order in the deviations , these are the only two cases of resonance that we have found .",
    "close to resonance the equations of motion have been solved exactly using an envelope approach .",
    "the resulting dynamics is similar to a beating between two modes with a beating frequency @xmath132 .",
    "we notice that the observed resonance behavior @xcite occurs exactly for the same condition that we have obtained , namely @xmath130 .",
    "also the fact that we did not find any other resonance condition up to the ninth order , indicates that the coupling terms that lead to this resonance are also responsible for the experimental resonance in the triaxial case .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note here that , quite generally , the down - conversion process from one excitation quantum into two excitation quanta with half the energy each , i.e. , the so - called beliaev damping @xcite , vanishes for the scissors modes .",
    "this is so because of the negative parity of the scissors modes . in terms of fluctuations of the anihilation operator @xmath133 given by @xmath134 ,",
    "the beliaev damping process is accounted for by an interaction term proportional to @xmath135 . here",
    "@xmath136 is again the condensate wave function . using our variational gaussian wave function given by eq .",
    "( [ trial ] ) , we clearly see that with only two scissors modes present this integral vanishes , since the integrant is an odd function . we believe that this result is independent of our trial wave function and also true within an exact approach @xcite . in our case the seventh - order coupling terms in eqs .",
    "( [ c1n ] ) and ( [ c2n ] ) correspond to a quadratic collisional damping process , where three excitation quanta decay into four excitation quanta with half the frequency and one excitation quantum with the same frequency .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schem ] .",
    "this makes sense physically since this is the lowest - order nonvanishing process if beliaev damping is forbidden and we are forced to apply the interaction term proportional to @xmath137 twice to accomplish the down conversion .",
    "another point worth mentioning here is that in the experiments the resonance is studied in most detail for an axially symmetric trap with an anisotropy ratio close to @xmath138 , when the @xmath6-scissors mode is degenerate with the quadrupole mode , which we have excluded in the present calculation . in that case",
    "we may argue that one scissors - mode quantum can decay into either another scissors - mode quantum and a quadrupole - mode quantum or into two quadrupole - mode quanta .",
    "these are in principle also beliaev damping processes , which are however again forbidden for similar reasons as before .",
    "nevertheless , a good understanding of these experiments requires an analysis that includes not only the @xmath6 and the @xmath116 scissors modes but also the quadrupole mode , because of the degeneracy that occures in this case . however , our theory should be directly applicable to the experiments with a triaxial trap .",
    "we hope that in the future more detailed experiments of this kind will also be performed , to make a direct comparison between our theory and experiment possible .",
