    "three interacting quantum systems may also be viewed as a bipartite system coupled to a third ,  external \" system . the raman coupled model , introduced some years ago @xcite constitutes an example of a simple , analytically solvable model involving three quantum subsystems ; a three level atom coupled to two modes of the cavity quantized field . in the limit in which the excited atomic state is well far - off resonance , a simpler , effective two - level hamiltonian may be derived , either by an adiabatic elimination of the upper atomic level @xcite or via a unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "in such a procedure , energy ( stark ) shifts arise and care must be taken , given that they may not always be neglected @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of the shifts normally leads to a very different dynamics , e.g. , from a non - periodic to a periodic atomic inversion .",
    "several features of the dynamics of such model have already been investigated @xcite ; in particular , quantum entanglement and possible applications to quantum computation @xcite .",
    "here we are going to discuss a different aspect of that system ; the influence of one of the fields ( a cavity mode ) on the dynamics of the atom as well as on the bipartite entanglement between the atom and the other cavity mode .",
    "we are going to consider different field preparations , such as coherent and thermal states , and we will also compare our results to the case in which one of the modes is not quantized , but treated as a classical field , instead . for simplicity , we do not take into account cavity losses or atomic spontaneous decay .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the model and solution . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss dynamical features with different preparations . in sec .",
    "iv we present the evolution of bipartite entanglement , and in sec .",
    "v we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a three level atom ( levels 1,2,3 ) in interaction with two modes ( mode 1 , of frequency @xmath0 and mode 2 , of frequency @xmath1 ) of the quantized field in a lambda configuration .",
    "direct transitions between the lower levels 1 and 2 are forbidden .",
    "if the upper level ( level 3 ) is highly detuned from the fields ( detuning @xmath2 ) , the effective hamiltonian may be written as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transition operators between levels 1 and 2 , @xmath6 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of mode 1 , @xmath7 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of mode 2 , and @xmath8 are the couplings of the transitions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is valid in the limit @xmath11 , but under certain conditions , exact similar hamiltonians may also be obtained @xcite .",
    "the stark shift terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 are usually neglected @xcite , but one should be very careful , given that their inclusion results in a rabi frequency depending linearly on the photon numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as a consequence , because of the shifts , the dynamics of the raman coupled model becomes basically periodic , with rabi frequency @xmath16}{2\\delta}\\label{rabifreq}\\ ] ] in contrast to the rabi frequency , which is proportional to @xmath17 , if the stark shifts are neglected @xcite . assuming an initial density operator of the product form , @xmath18 i.e. , with the atom initially prepared in level 1 , and the fields in generic states characterized by the coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "the full time - dependent density operator for the tripartite system may be written as    @xmath20    with coefficients @xmath21 where @xmath22 and    @xmath23\\sin\\left(\\omega_{n_{1},n_{2}}\\,t\\right),\\nonumber \\\\",

( [ rabifreq ] ) and having defined @xmath25 .",
    "the atomic response to the fields may be characterized by the atomic population inversion as a function of time , or @xmath26 - 1    =   8\\sum_{n_{1},n_{2}}^{\\infty}p_{n_1 } p_{n_2 } \\frac{r^{2}n_{1}\\left(n_{2}+1\\right)}{\\left[n_{1}+r^{2}\\left(n_{2}+1\\right)\\right]^{2}}\\sin^{2}\\left(\\omega_{n_{1},n_{2}}t\\right ) - 1,\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the product of the photon number distributions of the initial fields .",
    "the atomic inversion has peculiar features depending on the field statistics .",
    "for instance , in another well known model of optical resonance having a two level atom coupled to a single mode field , the jaynes cummings model ( jcm ) , a field initially in a fock state leads to pure oscillations of the atomic inversion , while an initial coherent state causes collapses and revivals @xcite of the rabi oscillations . on the other hand , in the jcm , for a field initially in a thermal state , the structure of collapses and revivals becomes highly desorganized @xcite and look like random . in the raman coupled model , in which an effective two level atom is coupled to two fields , rather than one , we expect of course a different behaviour .",
    "perhaps the most striking difference to the jcm is the periodicity of the atomic inversion ; moreover , the `` revival '' times do not depend on the intensity of the fields , and the field statistics has only little effect on the pattern of collapses and revivals @xcite . in order to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "( [ figure1 ] ) we have plots of the atomic inversion as a function of the scaled time @xmath28 for modes 1 and 2 prepared in coherent states : @xmath29 [ fig . [ figure1](a ) ] and for mode 1 prepared in a coherent state and mode 2 prepared in a thermal state : @xmath30 and @xmath31 [ fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) ] .",
    "we may note the periodical and well defined revivals occurring at the same times in both cases .",
    "curioulsly , even in the case of a thermal ( chaotic ) initial preparation , revivals are well defined , although their amplitude is slightly suppressed ; probably an effect due to the broader thermal distribution .",
    "we also note that if one of the fields is prepared in a fock state , if the other mode is prepared in a coherent state , for instance , collapses and revivals will still occur , due to the presence of the  in phase \" and  out of phase terms \" in eq .",
    "( [ atomicinv ] ) . in fig .",
    "( [ figure2 ] ) we have a plot of the atomic inversion for mode 1 prepared in a @xmath32 photons fock state and mode 2 prepared in a coherent state , and we note again the pattern of periodic and regular collapses and revivals . in",
    "what follows , this particular preparation ( fock - coherent ) is going to be compared with a situation termed  partially classical \" , having one of the fields , mode 2 , treated classically rather than prepared in a coherent state ( fully quantized case ) .     for a ) modes 1 and 2 prepared in coherent states and",

    "the effetive hamiltonian in the far - off resonance limit for the excited state is , in this case @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the quantum field / atom coupling constant , @xmath42 is the effective coupling constant and @xmath43 .",
    "note that apart from some shifts , the effective hamiltonian is very similar to a jcm hamiltonian .",
    "this means that the atomic response to a field ( mode 1 ) prepared in a fock state is going to be in the form of pure rabi oscillations , in contrast to the case where mode 2 is a quantum field prepared in the  quasi - classical \" coherent state , which shows collapses and revivals .",
    "this is another example showing that regarding the atomic response to a field , an intense quantum coherent state is not equivalent to a classical field .",
    "we would like now to discuss the entanglement between the atom and one mode of the field ( mode 1 , for instance ) considering the other mode as an  external \" coupled sub - system .",
    "we then trace over the variables of mode 2 , initially prepared in a coherent state , and examine the degree of entanglement between the atom and the remaining field ( mode 1 ) initially prepared , for the sake of simplicity , in a fock state . in order to quantify entanglement",
    ", we use the negativity . as we have done in the case of the atomic inversion",
    ", we will compare the results with the case in which mode 2 is considered to be a classical field .",
    "for an initial state having the atom in level 1 , mode 1 in a fock state @xmath44 and mode 2 in a coherent state @xmath45 , i.e. , a product state @xmath46 , the joint atom - mode 1 density operator , obtained after tracing over mode 2 from eq .",
    "( [ densityop ] ) , @xmath47 $ ] is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "( [ figure3 ] ) we have plotted the negativity ( [ figure3]a ) and the linear entropy ( [ figure3]b ) as a function of the scaled time @xmath58 .",
    "we note that entanglement is maximum approximately in the middle of the collapse region , and the atom - mode 1 state tends to become separable at the revival times themselves ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) . at the same time",
    "one may notice the similarities and differences between the negativity and the linear entropy ; the maximum of entanglement coincides with the maximum of mixedness , and separability approximately occurs at times in which the atom is close to a pure state .",
    "however , we should point out that there are time intervals of maximum mixedness which do not correspond to maximum entanglement ; this explicitly shows us the inadequacy of the linear entropy as a measure of entanglement ( as expected ) , given that the state under consideration ( atom - mode 1 ) is generally not a pure state .",
    "again , the evolution of entanglement in the  partially classical \" case is going to be very different .",
    "we would like to remark that in this case a bipartite quantum system is under the action of an external classical field , instead of a tripartite system from which we have obtained a bipartite system by tracing over one of the subsystems . having mode 1 prepared in a @xmath32 photon fock state ( mode 2 being a classical field ) , we have the following expressions for the atomic inversion ( with the atom initially in state 1 ) , @xmath59 - 1 , \\label{invsemiclass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the negativity , @xmath60\\right .",

    "compared to the fully quantized situation ; there are no collapses and revivals , as the atomic inversion and the negativity are now periodic functions of time .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ figure4 ] ) , where we have plotted the atomic inversion in eq .",
    "( [ invsemiclass ] ) and the negativity in eq .",
    "( [ negatsemiclass ] ) as a function of the scaled time @xmath62 . for a convenient choice of the parameter @xmath63 , the atomic population completely inverts and returns to its initial state at times in which atom - mode 1 are in a separable state , a very different behaviour from what happens if mode 2 is a quantized field .",
    "we have presented a study of the dynamics of three coupled quantum systems : one three level atom and two quantized cavity fields , focusing on some properties of the atomic system ( population inversion ) and the atom - mode 1 bipartite system ( entanglement ) . the second field ( mode 2 ) has been basically traced out and treated as an  external \" subsystem .",
    "our study has been based on the raman coupled model , involving an effective two level atom coupled to two electromagnetic cavity fields .",
    "we have considered different preparations for mode 2 : coherent and thermal states of the quantized field , as well as a classical field . in order to keep the consistency of the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "as has been already pointed out @xcite we have retained the stark shift terms in the raman hamiltonian , which have the remarkable effect of keeping the dynamics periodic . moreover",
    ", the periodic revival times will not depend on the statistics of the fields .",
    "this means that having one mode ( or even two ) prepared in the ( highly mixed ) thermal state will not change the regular atomic response during the atom / fields interaction , as we have shown explicitly here .",
    "this is a nice example of dynamical features robust against substantial variations in the field statistics .",
    "we have addressed the issue of bipartite entanglement between the atom and mode 1 , after tracing out mode 2 : we have found that for mode 1 initially prepared in a fock state and mode 2 in a coherent state , the atom / mode 1 reach maximum entanglement in the collapse region of the atomic inversion .",
    "we have also compared both the atomic response and entanglement in the case in which mode 2 is treated as a classical field (  partially classical \" case ) , rather than a quantum coherent  quasi - classical \" field , which result in very different evolutions ."
