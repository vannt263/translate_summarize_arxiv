    "betelgeuse was observed in january and february 2011 with the eso very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) using the astronomical multi - beam combiner , amber ( the instrument is described in petrov  @xcite ) in the @xmath2-band from 1.45 to 1.80 @xmath3 m and in the @xmath4-band from 2.10 to 2.45 @xmath3 m with the e0-g0-h0 , e0-g0-i1 and g0-h0-i1 triplets .",
    "the co and water vapor absorption lines in the @xmath4 band were investigated using the medium spectral resolution of the instrument ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the amber data reduction package version 3.0.3 also known as _ amdlib _ was used to obtain the calibrated interferometric observables ( tatulli  @xcite ) : the three visibilities associated to the three baselines are directly the amplitude of the object s fourier transform .",
    "it is not possible to measure directly the phase but the calibrated data contain three differential phases ( dp ) which are sensitive to the photocenter shift in a spectral line with respect to the continuum .",
    "the closure phase ( cp ) is the sum of three phases along the three baselines that form a triangle : @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity is independent from the atmospheric perturbations .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using telluric lines in the spectrum of the interferometric calibrator hr-1543 ( spectral type f6v ) .",
    "the error bars in the visibilities and closure phases of betelgeuse were underestimated , probably due to the low visibility of the fringes .",
    "we had to split each data file into five subsets to get a new estimation of these errors .",
    "we also noticed that some datasets were showing unusually low visibilities : we conclude it was caused by lock loss of the fringe tracker finito .",
    "these corrupted data sets were discarded .",
    "we used two different models to fit the continuum visibilities between 2.1 and 2.245 @xmath3 m : a uniform disk ( ud ) and a limb - darkened disk ( ldd ) using a power law ( @xmath6 ) according to hestroffer ( @xcite ) .",
    "we only fitted the data from the first and second lobes in order to avoid contributions from small scale structures at higher spatial frequencies .",
    "we used 8752 visibility points over 31577 , from which we derived an angular diameter of @xmath7 for the uniform disk model giving a reduced @xmath8 of 5.27 . for the limb - darkened model we obtained an angular diameter of @xmath9 and a power law coefficient of @xmath10 with a reduced @xmath8 of 4.91",
    "the result of these fits is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_continuum ] together with the @xmath11 coverage in the first and second lobes .",
    "our value of the angular diameter may not be representative of the average angular diameter of the star as we are only probing one direction of the @xmath11 plane .",
    "our ud value is significantly lower than the previous ones found by perrin  ( @xcite ) of @xmath12 mas and ohnaka  ( @xcite and @xcite ) of @xmath13 which was obtained for this later with vlti / amber observations in the same @xmath11 direction .",
    "this could be caused by the relative decrease of the diameter shown in ohnaka  ( @xcite ) or by a change in the flux distribution on the photosphere of the star . on the other hand",
    ", our ldd value agrees well with the @xmath14 of ohnaka  ( @xcite ) .",

    "the blue dashed line represents the average position angle of 73@xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]      the wavelengths longer than 2.245 @xmath3 m contain absorption lines from carbon monoxide ( co ) and water vapor ( h@xmath1o ) which are elements present in the molsphere described by tsuji ( @xcite ) and perrin  ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we restrain ourselves to the first two @xmath16 overtone band heads ( @xmath17 m ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] ( right panel ) that the other bands are not well fitted when these first two are .",
    "+ we modeled them using a kurucz atmosphere model ( castelli & kurucz @xcite and kurucz @xcite ) and a single layer containing both co and h@xmath1o at the same temperature and distance from the photosphere and the corresponding absorptions were computed from the line list of goorvitch ( @xcite ) for co and from partridge & schwenke ( @xcite ) for h@xmath1o .",
    "this model contains five parameters : the photospheric diameter @xmath18 , the molsphere diameter @xmath19 , the molsphere temperature @xmath20 , the co and h@xmath1o column densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "its analytical expression is given by : + @xmath23                   \\end{array}\\ ] ] if @xmath24 and otherwise : @xmath25                  \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 is the planck function , @xmath27 is the angle between the line of sight and the center of the star and @xmath28 is the molsphere opacity computed from the line lists of goorvitch ( @xcite ) and partridge & schwenke ( @xcite ) .",
    "the squared visibility is then derived by computing the hankel transform of this analytical expression : @xmath29    with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "+ an illustration of this model and an example of the corresponding spectrum of betelgeuse model are given in fig .",

    "the model contains five _ a priori _ independent parameters but there are some correlations between @xmath20 and @xmath19 and between the two column densities .",
    "because of this degeneracy , we had to develop a strategy to perform our fit .",
    "we fixed @xmath18 to the value obtained by the uniform disk fit of the continuum data .",
    "then we computed @xmath8 maps of our data by fitting @xmath21 and then @xmath22 at given @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    ": @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the spatial frequency . @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 are fitted on each cell of the grid @xmath35 .",
    "however , there was also a correlation between @xmath20 and the two column densities .",
    "we had to eliminate it by including the spectrum into our fit : this compensates for the lack of interferometric data in the band core caused by the band fringe fitting described in sect .",
    "[ sect_data_reduction ] .",
    "the @xmath8 maps are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig_chi2map ] and we derived the following values for the parameters of the molsphere :    @xmath36     map of the single layer model . _",
    "left : _ the co column density is fitted on each cell of the grid for a constant @xmath37 . _",
    "right : _ the h@xmath1o column density is fitted on each cell of the grid for a constant @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   map of the single layer model .",
    "_ left : _ the co column density is fitted on each cell of the grid for a constant @xmath37 . _",
    "right : _ the h@xmath1o column density is fitted on each cell of the grid for a constant @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    our two @xmath8 maps for carbon monoxide and water vapor present a minimum for the same couple of ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "therefore our hypothesis of a single layer containing both elements is validated .",
    "our best fit values for the angular diameter and the temperature of the molsphere are close to those derived by perrin  ( @xcite ) which were @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "our analysis of the amber visibilities in the continuum allowed us to compute new uniform disk and limb - darkened disk angular diameters .",
    "our absorption line analysis led us to new values for the molsphere parameters , consistent with the results from perrin  ( @xcite ) and ohnaka  ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ however , our analysis here only includes data from the first two co overtone band heads : it must be extended to the other bands , that may probe a deeper molecular layer , closer to the star s photosphere .",
    "finally we will conclude this analysis by exploiting the closure phase signal .",
    "this work is currently undergoing and will allow us to search for asymmetries in the light distribution at the surface of the star ."
