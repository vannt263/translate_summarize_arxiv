    "psr  j1903@xmath00327 was the first millisecond pulsar ( msp  ms and with a low surface magnetic field , @xmath4 g . ] ) discovered in the ongoing arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) pulsar survey @xcite . in the discovery paper  @xcite",
    ", we presented the results of phase - coherent radio timing of this pulsar carried out with the green bank and arecibo radio telescopes .",
    "these quickly revealed that the pulsar was in a 95-day orbit around a 1 solar mass ( @xmath5 ) companion .",
    "this object is remarkable for being the first ( and thus far , the only ) disk msp known to have an eccentric ( @xmath1 ) orbit . in globular clusters ( gcs ) there are several binary msps with eccentric orbits ; but those are thought to be caused by perturbations of the binary systems by occasional close interactions with other stars .",
    "coincident with the pulsar position derived from the timing , a star was found whose near - infrared magnitudes were consistent with a @xmath6 main - sequence star at the distance and reddening estimated for psr j1903 + 0327 .",
    "it was not known then whether this was just an unlikely ( @xmath7 2.6% ) chance alignment or whether the star is genuinely associated with psr  j1903@xmath00327 , and if so whether it is the binary companion responsible for the 95-day orbit of the pulsar .",
    "such a finding would be surprising , as the conventional understanding of msp evolution posits that such a neutron star ( ns ) is spun up to high spin frequencies by accretion of matter and angular momentum from a companion star while the companion passes through a giant phase @xcite ; this circularises the system , and a recycled msp is left orbiting a low - mass white dwarf ( the remnant core of the donor ) in a low - eccentricity orbit ( @xmath8 ; phinney 1992 ) . until the discovery of psr  j1903@xmath00327 all known msps in the galactic disk had such low - eccentricity orbits . for reviews , see phinney  &  kulkarni  ( 1994 ) , stairs  ( 2004 ) , tauris & van den heuvel ( 2006 ) .    for these reasons ,",
    "champion et al . ( 2008 ) proposed that psr  j1903@xmath00327 may be part of a triple system where the 95-day orbit of the pulsar is caused by a massive unseen wd and the third member is the star detected in the near - infrared .",
    "the latter is in a long - period orbit and drives the eccentricity of the inner pair through the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility , also discussed in @xcite is that the companion to psr  j1903@xmath00327 in the 95-day orbit is the star detected in the near - infrared , but that this eccentric , unusual system originated in an exchange interaction in a dense stellar environment , like a globular cluster .    in this paper , we present new optical measurements and further radio timing of psr  j1903@xmath00327 obtained with the aim of testing these scenarios .",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows .",
    "the optical and radio observations are described ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "the immediate results from these observations are described in   [ sec : results ] . in   [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of these results regarding the formation and evolution of this system . in   [ sec : formation ] we discuss how this system might have formed .",
    "we summarise our main conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "[ fig : finder ]   subsection of a 5min sdss @xmath9-band image taken with gmos at gemini north on sept.20th , 2007 shows the location of the @xmath10 slit . besides the companion to psr  j1903@xmath00327 denoted with psr , spectra",
    "were also extracted of stars a , b and c.,title=\"fig:\",width=309 ]        long - slit spectroscopy of the suspected counterpart to psr  j1903@xmath00327 was obtained with fors2 @xcite , the low dispersion spectrograph of eso s very large telescope .",
    "four spectra were obtained on 2008 june 21 , three on 2008 august 23 and one a day later , on august 24 .",
    "all spectra had exposure times of 46minutes , and used a @xmath11 slit combined with the 1028z holographic grism , providing wavelength coverage over 7830  to 9570 .",
    "the detectors were read out with @xmath12 binning , yielding a resolution of 3.4 , sampled at @xmath13pix@xmath14 .",
    "the slit was placed such that both the pulsar companion and a bright nearby star were centred on the slit .",
    "the observations were taken during clear and photometric nights , with the seeing between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the spectral observations were corrected for bias and flat - fielded using lamp flats .",
    "spectral extraction is complicated by the bright star , henceforth star a , located @xmath17 from the pulsar counterpart ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : finder ] ) . the star is brighter by about 5.6mag in the @xmath18-band and as a result about 20% of the detected counts at the spatial position of the pulsar counterpart are from the wings of the brighter star .",
    "the regular optimal extraction algorithm as described by horne  ( 1986 ) is not suited to extract blended spectra as it makes no assumptions about the spatial profile .",
    "instead , we use a variation on the algorithm by hynes  ( 2002 ) , which is based on the optimal extraction method of horne  ( 1986 ) .",
    "hynes  ( 2002 ) uses an analytic function to describe the spatial profile as a function of wavelength .",
    "this profile is fitted to the spectrum of an isolated template source and then used to simultaneously extract the spectra of the blended sources .",
    "we use a variation on this method .",
    "first , instead of using a voigt function to describe the spatial profile we use a moffat  ( 1969 ) function , essentially a modified lorentzian with a variable exponent . secondly , instead of removing the sky contribution before extraction , we include it in the fit , representing the sky as a first order polynomial added to the moffat profiles for each object in the blend .",
    "finally , the absence of an isolated template source forced us to use star a as a template .",
    "we used an iterative scheme to converge the properties of the profile as a function of wavelength from star a while removing the contribution of the pulsar counterpart and another faint star ( star b ) that was also part of the blend .",
    "in addition to these three objects , a fourth star ( star c ) is located 28^@xmath19 north - west of psr  j1903@xmath00327 on the slit . this star was not blended and extracted normally .",
    "arc lamp exposures obtained during daytime with the telescope pointing towards the zenith were used for wavelength calibration . however , comparison of wavelengths of the night sky emission lines from the science exposures showed wavelength offsets of up to 0.8  between different exposures , most likely due to flexure caused by the telescope pointing away from zenith . to correct for these offsets the wavelength calibration of june 21st",
    "was used to create a secondary line list of some 60 night sky emission lines in the first spectrum , which was subsequently used to calibrate the remaining 7 spectra .",
    "typical rms residuals of these fits were less than 0.05 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the averaged spectrum of the counterpart to psr  j1903@xmath00327 .",
    "the spectrum has a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 15 to 20 in the wavelength range of 8000  to 9000 .",
    "the spectrum is generally featureless except for clear absorption lines around 8540  and 8660 . at these wavelengths",
    "the most common spectral lines are those belonging to the caii triplet , and the paschen series of hydrogen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "though the paschen series has lines on these wavelengths , the absence of the other lines in the series argues for them being due to the calcium triplet .",
    "we made pulse time of arrival ( toa ) measurements of psr  j1903@xmath00327 using the 305-m arecibo radio telescope and the 105-m green bank telescope from 2006 december through 2010 january ; the observation dates and radio frequencies are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequencies+residuals ] .",
    "the toas obtained before 2008 january were described and used by champion et al .",
    "we now describe the observational setups used at the two observatories .",
    "in this re - analysis we use all the toas obtained from processing of data taken with the green bank s - band receiver ( with frequency coverage from 1650 to 2250 mhz ) ; these cover most of the year 2007 .",
    "the data were acquired using the `` spigot '' pulsar backend  a 3-level autocorrelation spectrometer which samples observing bands of up to 800  mhz @xcite .",
    "autocorrelation functions ( acfs ) of length 2048 lags were accumulated with 3-level precision and written to disk every 81.92@xmath20s .",
    "the acfs were subsequently fourier transformed to synthesise 2048-channel power spectra .",
    "we separately analyzed the lower and upper half of the band , dedispersing each and deriving toas using the methods described in the supplement of champion et al .",
    "the toa uncertainties are 6 @xmath20s in the upper half and 10 @xmath20s in the lower half of the band . in champion et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , only data from the upper half of the band were used .",
    "the arecibo data were obtained with four wideband arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps ; dowd , sisk & hagen , 2000 ) . with the `` l - wide '' receiver ,",
    "the wapps had bandwidth 50 mhz and were centred at 1520 , 1570 , 1620 and 1670  mhz ; each produced 512-lag acfs sampled with 3-level precision , accumulated and integrated every 64@xmath20s . with the `` s - wide '' receiver ,",
    "the wapps had bandwidth 50 mhz and were centred at 2125 , 2175 , 2225 , and 2275 mhz , though the latter was sometimes disconnected in order to use the arecibo signal processor ( asp , described below ) in its place . at these frequencies ,",
    "the wapps produced 256-lag acfs which were integrated for 32@xmath20s . with the s - high receiver",
    ", the wapps were configured in dual - board mode , allowing 100 mhz of bandwidth in each of 8 correlator boards , centred at 100 mhz intervals from 3150 to 3850 mhz .",
    "each board produced 128-lag acfs integrated for 32@xmath20s .",
    "as for the spigot data , the acfs from the wapps are fourier transformed to produce power spectra .",
    "these data were then dedispersed and folded modulo the pulsar s period using a routine written by one of us ( ihs ) specifically for this purpose ; this folds the spectra using polynomial coefficients calculated specifically for the specified observing frequencies .",
    "the folding results in 128-bin pulse profiles every 500 seconds for each wapp .    during some of the s - wide observations we collected data with the arecibo signal processor ( asp , demorest 2007 ) in parallel with three wapps .",
    "the asp band had a centre frequency of 2350  mhz .",
    "the asp coherently dedisperses a maximum of 16 4-mhz bands , for a maximum bandwidth of 64  mhz .",
    "these data were then immediately folded at the pulsar s rotational period , and 512-bin pulse profiles were stored for each of these bands every 120 seconds . however , because of the large dispersion measure ( dm ) of psr  j1903@xmath00327 we can only coherently dedisperse 12 of these 4-mhz bands at any given time . finally , we add all the bands and four 120-s integrations to produce pulse profiles with good s / n .",
    "all pulse profiles are cross - correlated in the fourier domain @xcite with a low - noise template derived from the sum of the pulse profiles obtained with the same spectrometer and at the same frequency . from this",
    ", we derive a total of 1872 topocentric toas . both the high - resolution wapp and asp data provide toa measurements with an average uncertainty of @xmath21s .    in the next step",
    "we use the tempo2 software package ( hobbs et al .",
    "2006 ) for toa analysis .",
    "this applies the clock corrections intrinsic to the observatory , the earth rotation data and the observatory coordinates to convert the toas to terrestrial time ( tt ) , as maintained by the bureau international des poids et mesures . for conversion of tt toas to coordinated barycentric time ( tcb ) toas we used the de / le 421 solar system ephemeris ( folkner , williams & boggs , 2008 ) .",
    "the program then minimises the squares of toa residuals  the difference between the observed and predicted toas .",
    "we used the `` dd '' orbital model @xcite ; this is optimal for describing eccentric orbits in a theory - independent manner .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table 1 , their uncertainties are the 1-@xmath22 values estimated by tempo2 ( throughout this paper , the quoted uncertainties are 1-@xmath22 , except when stated otherwise ) .",
    "the toa residuals are displayed in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : frequencies+residuals ] .    we have performed a parallel analysis using the tempo software package . the resulting timing parameters and their uncertainties ( as estimated by tempo )",
    "are also presented in table 1 .",
    "several timing parameters are different from those estimated by tempo2 .",
    "all time - like quantities ( spin frequency , orbital period , projected semi - major axis , time of passage through periastron and @xmath23 , which is strongly covariant with the latter ) are different because tempo converts the toas to barycentric dynamic time ( tdb ) , a time scale that is different from tcb .",
    "the right ascension and declination are different because the de / le 405 solar system ephemeris @xcite uses an earlier celestial reference frame .",
    "furthermore , we included in tempo a modified version of the dd orbital model that uses the orthometric parameterization of the shapiro delay , as described in @xcite .",
    "the `` orthometric amplitude '' ( @xmath24 ) and the `` orthometric ratio '' ( @xmath25 ) provide an improved description of the areas of the ( @xmath26 ) plane where the system is likely to be compared to the `` range '' ( @xmath27 ) and `` shape '' ( @xmath28 ) parameters used in the normal parameterization . in cases where we can measure other post - keplerian ( pk ) parameters , the new parameterization yields an improved test of general relativity .",
    "using either tempo or tempo2 there are no apparent trends in the residuals and the normalised @xmath29 is 1.3 , which is similar to what we observe in other msps timed with these observing systems .",
    "this means that the timing model provides a complete description of the observed toas , with no significant , unmodelled effects present .",
    "this also means that the 1-@xmath22 uncertainties reported by tempo and tempo2 are reasonably accurate estimates of the real uncertainties .",
    "the non - unity value of the normalised @xmath29 likely reflects a slight underestimation of the toa uncertainties by the cross - correlation analysis , but it could also be due to red noise in the pulsar rotation , as suggested by the marginal ( almost 3-@xmath22 ) detection of @xmath30 . to account for this , the timing parameters in table 1 were obtained after the multiplication of the toa uncertainty estimates by a scale factor ; this is calculated separately for each dataset so that its normalised @xmath29 is 1 .",
    "this scale factor is 1.1 for all the arecibo data and 1.3 for the gbt data .",

    "the additional , previously undetermined parameters in table 1 are the proper motion ( with total magnitude @xmath20 and position angle @xmath72 ) and the apparent variation of the size of the orbit , @xmath51 ; this is given by @xmath129 where @xmath9 is the orbital inclination , @xmath130 is the position angle of the line of nodes , @xmath131 is the variation of @xmath47 due to an intrinsic variation of @xmath9 , @xmath132 is a variation of the semi - major axis @xmath133 , @xmath71 is the distance to the pulsar and @xmath134 is the difference of galactic accelerations of the binary and the solar system , projected along the line of sight .",
    "the first term is by far the largest ; it is an effect of the proper motion , which constantly changes the viewing geometry .",
    "if this causes a change of @xmath9 as viewed from earth then there will be a secular change of the projected size of the orbit , @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the second term describes the changing doppler shift of the binary relative to the solar system barycentre . for a nominal dm distance of 6.4 kpc ,",
    "this amounts to @xmath136 .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude smaller than the measurement error ; this term is thus ignored in the following discussion .",
    "the third term is due to any real changes in the orbital plane of the binary system .",
    "the only likely contribution to this is from spin - orbit coupling @xcite ; the resulting @xmath131 should be one order of magnitude smaller than the measurement error ( see detailed discussion in ",
    "[ sec : spin - orbit ] ) . finally , the fourth term is due to a real change in the size of the orbit .",
    "the prediction for @xmath137 caused by gravitational wave emission is of the order of @xmath138 ; many orders of magnitude too small .",

    "even alternative msp formation scenarios ( like merger of massive wds or accretion induced collapse ) require two stars to form the msp .",
    "the discovery that the companion to psr  j1903@xmath00327 is the ms star previously suspected of being associated with the system immediately rules out the detailed triple system scenario proposed in champion et al .",

    "the problem is that at the closest approach between the stars the companion is @xmath201 times smaller than its present roche lobe .",
    "being an unevolved ms star it was even smaller in the past and even less likely to have supplied the material that recycled this pulsar .",
    "could the former donor have exchanged orbits with the main - sequence companion and now orbit the j1903@xmath00327 binary system at a large distance ? if there were a third component in the system , the j1903@xmath00327 binary system would be accelerating towards it , with a line - of - sight component given by @xmath202 .",

    "our measurements of @xmath60 and @xmath30 are not statistically significant ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) , i.e. , we detect no third component in this system .",

    "we can see that the minimum possible distance from the galactic centre is always larger than 3 kpc .",

    "it is also apparent from our simulations that the distance from the galactic plane never exceeds 270  pc ( 99.7% confidence limit ) , which is unusual for msps .",
    "the globular clusters observed outside the bulge have a wide distribution of galactic heights @xcite , which implies that most of them orbit the galaxy well outside the plane .",
    "the formation of psr  j1903@xmath00327 in such a cluster would require that the system is ejected at the exact time the cluster is crossing the galactic plane and that the resulting velocity is very nearly in the galactic plane and close to the average local galactic rotation ( the system s current peculiar velocity is 37@xmath2109 km s@xmath14 , see bottom plot of fig .",

    "we find this possibility highly unlikely .",
    "the probability of formation in an exchange interaction appears therefore to be extremely small .",
    "to summarise , the measured mass of psr  j1903@xmath00327 ( plus its small spin period and magnetic field ) make any scenarios where it forms as it is unlikely ; all pulsar characteristics are consistent with it having been recycled (   [ sec : massimplications ] ) .",
    "our limits on the variation of the eccentricity and our optical detection exclude the triple system scenario proposed in champion et al .",
    "( 2008 ,   [ sec : notriple ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find that the present companion is not the donor star that recycled the pulsar ; if this former donor still exists it is no longer bound to the system .",
    "furthermore , our calculations of the 3-d systemic motion (   [ sec : motion ] ) show that it is unlikely that the system originated in an environment with high stellar density .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the former donor star was exchanged by the present companion .",
    "so how did psr  j1903@xmath00327 form ? and what happened to the former donor star ?",
    "we suggest that the system started as a triple ( indicated below in square brackets ) , where the outer companion ( the present ms star companion ) was initially on a much wider orbit than at present .",
    "the inner binary system ( indicated in parentheses ) had a much shorter orbital period and consisted of two somewhat more massive ms stars : @xmath211 \\\\ \\\\$ ] ( the numbers are conjectural , we show them for illustrative purposes only ) . the more massive star ( the progenitor of the pulsar ) , evolves and becomes a red supergiant ( rsg ) : @xmath212 \\\\ \\\\$ ] at this point",
    ", it starts transferring mass to the other component in the inner binary .",
    "in such a situation , mass transfer is generally unstable , and the envelope of the rsg is expected to engulf the companion and lead to a common envelope ( ce ) phase , where the helium core of the rsg and the inner companion are embedded in the envelope of the rsg . because of friction with the envelope , the orbit of this embedded binary will decay , releasing orbital energy in the process .",
    "if this energy is sufficient to eject the envelope , this will leave a much closer binary consisting of a helium star and the more - or - less unaffected inner companion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath213 \\\\ \\\\$ ] if the outer component of the triple system is close enough , it may also be affected by this ce phase , since the envelope will greatly expand because of the orbital energy that is being deposited within it ( to radii of @xmath214au ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it will also be engulfed by the expanding envelope and will also experience a spiral - in phase @xcite .",
    "this will produce a much closer triple system .",
    "without realistic hydrodynamical simulations , it is difficult to determine the post - ce parameters . here , we will consider two potential outcomes , which we will discuss in more detail later : @xmath215 \\\\ \\\\$ ] or @xmath216 \\\\ \\\\$ ] eventually , the he core will explode in a supernova and produce a ns .",
    "the sudden mass loss associated with this event will make the orbits of the other two components wider and somewhat eccentric : @xmath217 \\\\ \\\\$ ] or @xmath218 \\\\ \\\\$ ] this event could be either a normal fe - core collapse supernova ( sn ) or an electron - capture ( e - capture ) supernova ( see * ? ? ? * and further references therein ) .",
    "given the fact that the system remained bound after the explosion , it is not likely that the sn produced a major kick , nor large fractional mass loss , particularly under scenario `` a '' , where the system is wider and acquires a small eccentricity .",
    "this is consistent with the observed peculiar velocity for the system , which is smaller than for the other systems where we can make a complete determination of this quantity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] ) .",
    "we note too that such sn characteristics are expected from e - capture supernovae .      at this stage",
    "the inner binary resembles the progenitor of a typical low- or intermediate - mass x - ray binary ( l / imxb ) .",
    "once the normal stellar component of the inner binary has evolved to fill its roche lobe , mass transfer to the ns will start to increase its mass and spin it up to millisecond periods ( see , e.g. , pfahl et al .",
    "initially , when the separation of the inner binary is sufficiently small compared to the periastron of the outer component , the evolution of the l / imxb will not be significantly affected by the presence of the outer component .    if the mass - transfer rate is very high , mass loss from the inner binary will cause the orbit of the outer component to widen to some degree .",
    "however , even for conservative mass transfer the inner binary is generally expected to widen more drastically , in particular in the 2.5 day scenario ( scenario `` a '' in   [ sec : multiple ] ; see podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath219 \\\\ \\\\$ ] until its separation reaches a critical fraction of the periastron distance of the outer companion .",
    "this leads to a chaotic three - body interaction ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most probable outcomes is the ejection of the least massive component  in this case most likely the mass donor in the inner binary , leaving a bound , eccentric binary system consisting of the msp and the formerly outer companion , in an orbit tighter than before : @xmath220",
    "if the starting orbital period is small ( @xmath221 hr , scenario b in   [ sec : multiple ] ) , then gravitational radiation might lead to the destruction of the remnant of the former donor by the newly formed msp , very much in the same way as psr 1957 + 20 , the black - widow pulsar ( fruchter et al . 1988 ) , is evaporating its companion ( although in the latter case the process might take several hubble times ) .",
    "this is a possible formation channel for isolated msps .",
    "since these represent @xmath720% of the known msps in the galactic disk , this should not be too unlikely a scenario .",
    "the end result would also resemble the j1903@xmath00327 binary system .",
    "one can imagine alternative triple scenarios to the one outlined above .",
    "for example , it is possible that the progenitor of the msp was initially the outer component of a stable triple system .",
    "when this massive star evolved to become a red supergiant , it could have engulfed the inner binary completely , leading to a spiral - in of that binary inside the common envelope .",
    "as it spirals in , its orbit could become disrupted by the tide induced by the more massive component ; both of its components then start orbiting the core of the more massive he star independently , but at different distances given their different orbital velocities prior to disruption .",
    "this would produce a result quite similar to the double star spiral - in .",
    "another possibility is that this binary survived the ce phase , but it was later disrupted when its orbital radius increases due to a mass transfer stage .",
    "our arecibo and green bank radio timing observations include a full determination of the relativistic shapiro delay , a very precise measurement of the apsidal motion and new constraints of the orbital orientation of the system . through a detailed analysis of all of these ,",
    "we derive new constraints on the masses of the pulsar and companion .",
    "the mass of the pulsar ( @xmath3  m@xmath222 ) adds to a growing population of nss with masses which significantly exceed 1.4  m@xmath222 and rules out some of the proposed equations of state of superdense matter .",
    "this high mass also suggests that the pulsar was recycled .    our observations with the very large telescope",
    "reveal shifts in the spectral lines of the suspected companion to psr  j1903@xmath00327 , which show that it has the 95-day orbital motion expected for the pulsar s binary companion .",
    "this star has characteristics very similar to the sun ; making this system unique among all known binary msps . a detailed discussion of the results of the radio timing and optical spectroscopy rules out most proposed formation mechanisms .",
    "we are then forced to accept the only remaining possibility , i.e. , that the system originated from a triple system with a compact inner component and the presently observed ms companion as the outer component .",
    "the inner compact binary then formed the observed msp , with the elimination of the former donor star ( i.e. , evolution towards an `` isolated '' msp ) , or its ejection from the system .",
    "detailed stellar evolution simulations of the formation of this system might provide new insights on how msps form .",
    "as an example , the mass loss and kick velocities associated with the supernova event that formed this ns must have been small enough to allow the whole system to remain bound .",
    "such a gentle formation would produce a small recoil velocity for the whole system ; this is consistent with the small peculiar velocity observed at present .",
    "this would generally favour alternative small - kick formation mechanisms , like electron capture supernovae .",
    "this means that a dynamical study of this system could lead to a conclusive demonstration of alternative formation channels for nss in general .",
    "some of these exotic mechanisms ( for example , white dwarf mergers ) could be especially important for explaining the existence of isolated msps .",

    "<S> psr  j1903@xmath00327 , a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric ( @xmath1 ) 95-day orbit with a ( @xmath2 ) companion poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution in binary and multiple - star systems . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe optical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed to explain formation of this system . </S>",
    "<S> radio timing measurements of three post - keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of a millisecond pulsar to date : @xmath3 solar masses ( 99.7% confidence limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out some equations of state for super - dense matter , furthermore it is consistent with spin - up of the pulsar by mass accretion , as suggested by its short spin period and low magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart show that its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar s 95-day orbit ; being therefore its binary companion . </S>",
    "<S> this finding rules out a previously suggested scenario which proposes that the system is presently a hierarchical triple . </S>",
    "<S> conventional binary evolution scenarios predict that , after recycling a neutron star into a millisecond pulsar , the binary companion should become a white dwarf and its orbit should be nearly circular . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that if psr  j1903@xmath00327was recycled , its present companion was not responsible for it . </S>",
    "<S> the optical detection also provides a measurement of the systemic radial velocity of the binary ; this and the proper motion measured from pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of the galaxy , but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> thus an exchange interaction in a dense stellar environment ( like a globular cluster or the galactic centre ) is not likely to be the origin of this system . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that after the supernova that formed it , the neutron star was in a tight orbit with a main - sequence star , the present companion was a tertiary farther out . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion , forming a millisecond pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> the former donor star then disappears , either due to a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star ( caused by the expansion of the inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer ) , or in the case of a very compact inner system , due to ablation / accretion by the newly formed millisecond pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the possible evolution of such a system before the supernova .    </S>",
    "<S> pulsars : general  pulsars : searches  pulsars : timing  stars : neutron  methods : statistical </S>"
