    "if the arrangement is defined over a finite field , theorem  [ grothintro ] shows how to recover the poincar polynomial of an arrangement by counting points , an observation made by several authors ( see e.g. , theorem  2.69 in @xcite ) . placing this elementary result in the grothendieck ring @xmath14 for arbitrary @xmath0 has not - so - elementary applications : for example , we note that the orlik ",

    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the subtlest part of the information carried by the chern ",
