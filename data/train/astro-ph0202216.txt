    "damped lyman-@xmath3 absorption - line systems ( dlas ) seen against background quasars are the highest column density absorbers , n@xmath4 @xmath5 , and are thought to be associated with galaxies .",
    "often they are assumed to be the disks of large spiral galaxies or their progenitors ( wolfe 1995 ) , but there is growing evidence that not all dlas are associated with bright spirals ( e.g. cohen 2001 , lanzetta et al .",
    "1997 , miller et al .",
    "1999 , colbert & malkan 2001 ) .",
    "the difficulty in studying the properties of these systems arises , in large part , because there are not many systems known at low-@xmath6 : only 9 dlas have been found with @xmath7 ( rao & turnshek 2000 , bowen et al .",
    "2001a , steidel et al .",
    "1994 , lanzetta et al .",
    "1997 , and le brun et al .",
    "1997 ) , and only 2 of those are at @xmath8 where detailed observations are possible .",
    "absorption line studies do not provide adequate statistical samples at low-@xmath6 because their pencil beams survey only small volumes of local space .",
    "many of the identified dla candidates have low luminosity or low surface brightness , so it has been suggested that the absorption line population may be biased against detecting bright spiral galaxies .",
    "for example , bright spiral galaxies might contain enough dust to obscure the background qso ( fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "however , no low redshift comparison sample exists to provide an indication of what we should expect to see . in this study",
    "we construct a local comparison sample from a blind 21 cm survey we carried out at the arecibo observatory ( rosenberg & schneider 2001 ) and use it to predict the characteristics of the low redshift dla population .",
    "several previous attempts have been made to predict the properties of dlas in the local universe based on known properties of nearby galaxies .",
    "rao & briggs ( 1993 ) and rao , turnshek & briggs ( 1995 ) combined optical luminosity functions for different morphological types with a linear relationship between hi mass and optical luminosity .",
    "they found that nearly all of the galaxy cross - section comes from large , bright spirals and that the hi cross - section implied by these galaxies would indicate a substantial decline in total hi cross - section since @xmath6=0.5 .",
    "salucci & persic ( 1999 ) also attempted to account for the local population of dlas by combining hi observations with optical luminosity functions .",
    "they found that large spirals contain most of the hi mass density in the local universe and that their mass density is similar to what is found in the damped absorbers . in parallel with",
    "this work , zwaan , briggs , & verheijen ( 2001 ) studied a volume limited , optically selected sample of galaxies in the ursa major cluster .",
    "the results they obtain are similar those those found here despite concerns one may have about the optical selection and overdensity in the region .    because galaxies with relatively high hi masses contribute most of the hi content of the local universe ( rosenberg & schneider 2001 ; zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ) , and because most luminous spirals have large hi masses , it may seem reasonable to conclude that luminous spirals must produce most of the absorption .",
    "the failing of this argument is that the correlation between hi mass and stellar luminosity is quite weak  a large fraction of high hi - mass systems have very low stellar luminosities , as we show in  4.2 .",
    "the recent completion of large 21 cm hi surveys provides a galaxy measurement that is more directly related to hi absorption that can be used to predict the characteristics of dlas .",
    "preliminary studies of these `` blind '' surveys ( rosenberg & schneider 2001 ; zwaan et al .",
    "2001 ) suggested a significantly larger total hi cross - section for the nearby galaxy population than was suggested by the earlier optically - selected samples .",
    "the present paper expands on those preliminary results with a more detailed analysis of the predicted hi and optical properties of the dlas .",
    "in particular , we analyze near - infrared measurements of our sample of galaxies from the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to predict the stellar properties of the dlas .    in section 2",
    "we show that an hi - selected sample makes a good basis for predicting the properties of dlas .",
    "in addition to selecting galaxies within the same range of gas column densities , hi mass selection is nearly equivalent to selection by cross - sectional area .",
    "section 3 contains a discussion of how @xmath0 is calculated for our hi - selected sample and the resulting value of @xmath0 at @xmath6=0 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our predictions for the properties of local dlas : hi masses (  4.1 ) , j - band luminosities (  4.2 ) , and kinematics (  4.3 ) .",
    "studying the properties of damped  absorbers is difficult because it requires the systems to be nearby where absorption - line studies requires space based uv spectroscopy and the volume surveyed by each line of sight is small . to study the properties of low-@xmath6 absorbers we must construct a surrogate sample for which we have better statistics .",
    "we use a blind , 21 cm emission line survey , the arecibo dual - beam survey ( adbs ) as a local comparison sample for dla properties .    the adbs selected galaxies on the basis of their 21-cm hi flux .",
    "the survey covered @xmath9 430 deg@xmath10 in the arecibo main beam with a velocity coverage of 654 to 7977  and identified 265 galaxies , with hi masses ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "only a third of the adbs galaxies had previously identified optical counterparts , partly because we detected some galaxies in the zone of avoidance , but also because there is a substantial population of low surface brightness galaxies that are not easily identified in magnitude - limited optical surveys .",
    "to relate the adbs detection statistics to those of dla studies , we need to determine the cross - sectional area for the galaxies above a column density of @xmath13 @xmath5 .",
    "only a few of the adbs sources were resolved in the arecibo observations and , therefore , only had a measure of the total hi flux .",
    "we made spatially - resolved d - array follow - up observations from the very large array ( vla ) for 84 of the adbs galaxies .",
    "for this study , we use the 50 sources with a major axis diameter ( at 2@xmath14 @xmath5 ) at least 40% larger than the beam to determine the hi cross - section properties of our sample .",
    "we find that the hi cross - section is closely correlated with the hi mass of each source , as shown in figure [ fig : massarea ] .",
    "the hi mass is determined from the source flux , distance , and linewidth using the standard equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the integrated line flux in jy , and d is the distance in mpc , corrected for large scale velocity flows ( tonry et al .",
    "2000 ) , adopting h@xmath17 = 75  mpc@xmath18 .",
    "the area of the galaxy , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the major and minor axis diameters at an hi column density of @xmath13 @xmath5 .",
    "the measurements for each galaxy are provided in the appendix .",
    "= 0.9    because most of our vla measurements were not highly resolved , one might question whether our cross - section estimates are accurate .",
    "we have therefore consulted the literature , collecting high - resolution hi measurements for a wide variety of galaxies ( see appendix ) .",
    "the 53 literature sources with minor - axis dimensions at least 5 times larger than synthesized beam are shown in figure [ fig : massarea ] with open triangles , and are in excellent agreement with the adbs sample , shown as solid circles .",
    "the highest - resolution literature sources ( with a minor axis diameter at least 10 times larger than the beam size ) are indicated by large triangles .",
    "we find no significant differences between any of these samples , leading us to conclude that the correlation seen in figure [ fig : massarea ] is unrelated to resolution effects . in any case , the hi masses are based on the total hi emission from the galaxy , so resolution effects could only shift points up or down in the figure and could not artificially generate the observed correlation .",
    "distance errors _ do _ lead to errors parallel to the observed correlation ; however , the largest conceivable errors lead to small shifts on the scale of this figure , which spans four orders of magnitude in hi mass .",
    "we averaged forward and backward least squares fits to the high - resolution data , yielding the relationship : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cross - section in kpc@xmath10 and @xmath24 is the hi mass in solar masses ( shown in the figure by the dotted line ) .",
    "we find similar relationships for the adbs data alone ( although with a slope slightly less than unity ) , and for subsets of the high - resolution data .",
    "none of these subsets have slopes significantly different from 1 .",
    "if we combine all of the data , the slope is @xmath25 , with a correlation coefficient of 97.7% .",
    "if we assume the relationship has slope 1 , the resulting fit is : @xmath26 and the intercept value ( @xmath27 ) is consistent for the various subsets to within @xmath28 .",
    "a similar correlation between hi size and hi mass was previously noted for high - hi - mass galaxies by giovanelli & haynes ( 1983 ) using the arecibo telescope .",
    "their sample included galaxies in the virgo cluster , yet they found no significant differences between the fits for hi - deficient and hi - rich galaxies .",
    "verheijen & sancisi ( 2001 ) likewise observed a correlation for ursa major cluster galaxies ( with @xmath29 measuring them at a slightly lower hi column density .",
    "our results demonstrate that the correlation spans a very wide range of masses , and the correlation is consistent whether the sample is hi - selected ( adbs galaxies ) or optically selected ( literature data ) .",
    "this indicates that the relationship between hi mass and cross - section is fundamental .    _",
    "the tightness of this relationship indicates that our hi mass dependent galaxy selection is nearly equivalent to the cross - sectional area selection of the dla population . _",
    "the strong correlation we find between hi cross - section and hi mass is probably due , in part , to measuring the galaxies at a high column density .",
    "we expect a larger dispersion at lower column densities because in the outer parts of galaxies tidal debris and gas - stripping processes have a strong effect on the measured extent .",
    "for both the adbs and literature galaxies , the hi above the @xmath30 @xmath5 isophote is generally confined to a roughly disk - shaped region , but we see emission with a wide variety of extents and morphologies at lower column densities .",
    "another reason for the good correlation is that the hi cross - section has a weak dependence on galaxy inclination .",
    "there is a partial cancellation between the smaller area presented by an inclined disk , and the larger radius at which the column density remains above @xmath30 @xmath5 because of the longer path length through an inclined disk .",
    "we find this to be demonstrated empirically for those disk galaxies that authors have constructed inclination - corrected models of the radial dependence of hi surface density ( see appendix ) .",
    "haynes & giovanelli ( 1984 ) found a similar correlation between hi mass and the _ optical _ sizes of galaxies for a sample spanning a similar range in hi mass .",
    "we also find that the dimensions of adbs galaxies as measured on the palomar sky survey closely correlate with their hi mass .",
    "this suggests that the size of the optically visible region is closely related to the dense regions of the hi gas being studied here .",
    "finally , we note that in comparing emission and absorption line studies we are comparing gas on very different angular scales : a background quasar s extent of perhaps 0.25 - 1  for absorption versus @xmath91060  for synthesis array studies .",
    "the resolution of the synthesis data may overlook the small scale properties of these systems .",
    "if the surface filling factor for n@xmath31 @xmath5 is small , we would overestimate the size of the damped region for each of these galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", there may be small regions of damped emission diluted with low column density gas beyond our measured hi isophote which contribute to a larger hi covering area .",
    "detailed studies of the hi covering fraction are available for very few galaxies , and from what has been done to date , there are disparities in the covering fractions that have been derived .",
    "braun & walterbos ( 1992 ) , studying the small scale hi structure in m31 with a resolution of 33 pc , find that the hi surface filling fraction approaches 1 where the emission brightness temperature exceeds @xmath95 k ( equivalent to a column density of 2 @xmath32 @xmath5 for an asymptotic temperature t@xmath33 k and a velocity width of 21.5 ) .",
    "these numbers suggest that the correction for the covering fraction in these galaxies should be relatively small .",
    "we can estimate the probability of detecting a galaxy in an absorption line study if we know its cross - section and its relative contribution to the overall population of absorbers .",
    "for each adbs galaxy we use the correlation found in the previous section to estimate its cross - section @xmath34 , and we determine its relative contribution based on the relative sensitivity to each source detected . we characterize the latter by the total volume @xmath35 within which each source could have been detected . the sensitivity criteria and completeness of the adbs has been carefully evaluated and tested and is a function of the galaxy s flux and linewidth , the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection , and properties of the instrumental response ( see rosenberg & schneider 2002 for a complete discussion ) . to find the number of systems expected per unit redshift ( @xmath0 ) , we sum over all sources : @xmath36 where @xmath37 gives the volume density for each source .",
    "thus , summing over all of the adbs galaxies , our predicted total cross section at zero redshift is @xmath38 .",
    "we assume an error on the adbs result of 25% as an estimate of potential systematics in the mass cross - section relationship and the covering factor to actually produce damped  absorption .",
    "the formal statistical uncertainty associated with our estimate is only a few percent .",
    "= 0.9    figure [ fig : dndz ] shows @xmath0 as a function of redshift for dlas .",
    "the highest-@xmath6 points , indicated by stars , are from storrie - lombardi & wolfe ( 2000 ) who combined their survey of 40 quasars with previous surveys .",
    "the resulting sample contains 646 quasars and 85 dlas with column densities @xmath39 @xmath5 covering the redshift range @xmath40 .",

    "( 1995 ) , based on the properties of optically - selected galaxies at low redshift .",
    "the filled circle is our result described above .",
    "our value for @xmath0 at @xmath41 is consistent with the @xmath42 = @xmath43 value found by churchill ( 2001 ) for mg ii systems with strong fe ii absorption , which are good candidates for damped absorption systems ( rao & turnshek 2000 ) .",
    "these results are also consistent with a similar study of the hi properties of galaxies by zwaan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "our adbs result is consistent with the @xmath44 , no evolution model shown by the solid line in figure [ fig : dndz ] . because of the large error bars on these data , we can not entirely rule out evolution in the dla population . however , our result rules out strong evolution of the absorber population between @xmath41 and @xmath45 as was implied by the rao et al .",
    "( 1995 ) result .",
    "these results differ because the @xmath0 distribution in the local universe is not dominated by large disks , but has substantial contribution from dwarf galaxies as we explore in the next section .",
    "we have identified a sample of galaxies that we believe is representative of dlas at @xmath46 .",
    "we use the properties of this sample to predict the nature of the dla population locally by splitting up the contribution to @xmath0 in equation 2 according to various properties of the adbs galaxies .",

    "therefore , this central 50% of sources cover a range in hi mass from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , relatively low hi mass sources compared to the knee of the schechter function .",
    "because @xmath52 galaxies are a major source of the light in the universe , and @xmath53 galaxies are a major source of the hi mass , it is sometimes assumed that the optical counterparts to the dlas are hi - rich @xmath52 galaxies  bright spirals ( wolfe 1995 ) . instead , many of the low-@xmath6 dlas appear to be low luminosity or are not detected ( colbert & malkan 2001 , steidel et al . 1994 , lebrun et al .",

    "significant differences between the kinematics of the low-@xmath6 adbs sample , and the @xmath65 systems studied by prochaska & wolfe ( 2001 , hereafter pw ) could indicate evolution of the population despite the fairly constant number density of sources found above .",

    "we would also like to thank the vla staff for their assistance in the observations and reduction of this data , and the 2mass team for all of the hard work that went into making the survey a reality .",
    "in this appendix we present vla data for the adbs sample of galaxies , as well as high - resolution literature data used as a comparison sample to confirm our results .",
    "in addition , we provide some further analysis of the hi cross - sections of the galaxies beyond the analysis in the main text .      the galaxies in the adbs were observed with the vla in d - array , with relatively short duration ( 10 to 15 min ) integrations .",
    "these were usually split into two time intervals in order to improve the @xmath72-@xmath73 coverage of the observations .",
    "further details of the observational procedures can be found in rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) .",
    "we present the basic information on the 50 sources detected with the vla that have a major axis diameter ( at @xmath74 @xmath5 ) at least 40% larger than the beam .. all were reduced using the observatory s _ aips _ routine _ imagr _ , setting the _ robust _ parameter to 0 .",
    "this provides a good compromise , providing nearly as good noise characteristics as natural weighting and nearly as small a beam as uniform weighting .",
    "table a.1 lists the fwhm dimensions of the beam along with other measured parameters for the galaxies .    the elliptical dimensions of the galaxies at a column density of @xmath30 @xmath5 were fit to the total hi maps using the _ iraf stsdas _ package _ ellipse_. the mean velocities and total hi masses determined from the vla observations are all consistent with our arecibo detection measurements .",
    "we also provide a flow - corrected distance estimate based on tonry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , assuming @xmath75 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "we compiled higher - resolution hi measurements from the literature for comparison with our results .",
    "we consulted sources listed in martin s ( 1998 ) bibliographic compilation of hi maps in order to identify synthesis observations with beam sizes at least ten times smaller than the reported hi dimensions .",
    "we further restricted our sample to sources that martin indicated reached column densities below @xmath30 @xmath5 and which had both hi contour maps and radial density profiles .",
    "this yielded about 100 candidate sources .",
    "we found that the resulting list contained few low - mass sources , so we added several more - recent papers that concentrated on dwarf galaxies .",
    "the resulting sample spans all galaxy types from giant ellipticals to dwarf irregulars .",
    "table a.2 compiles the information collected from these papers in a similar format as for our adbs galaxies .",
    "none of the papers directly reported the dimensions of the galaxy at @xmath30 @xmath5 , so we estimated them from the hi column density contour maps .",
    "the beam dimensions are those reported in each paper for the contour maps . in a few cases ( noted by the word `` ring '' or `` mult '' in the notes column of the table )",
    "the distribution of hi above @xmath30 @xmath5 was not well described as a disk . in these cases ,",
    "we give major and minor axis dimensions that approximately indicate ( a ) the combined length of the regions of hi that exceeded our fiducial level , and ( b ) the narrower dimension of these regions .",
    "these dimensions should yield a fairly accurate total cross - section for the sources .",
    "we note that many other sources also showed irregularities around the edges , or small holes or small regions outside the main disk , but these amount to only slight deviations in the overall dimensions of the sources .    for papers that displayed inclination - corrected , azimuthally - averaged radial density profiles",
    ", we again used the published plots to estimate the radius at which the hi column density reached our fiducial level . in a few cases",
    "the radial profile was plotted , but did not exceed the @xmath30 @xmath5 level . in all of these cases , the hi contour map had regions above this level , but the azimuthal averaging had produced a lower mean level .",
    "we note that these radial profiles are quite sensitive to the inclination estimates . as a result , they tend to be more accurate for disk galaxies , and much less so for dwarf irregulars .",
    "the redshifts and morphological types listed in the table were taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . the distances are again based on the flow - corrected tonry model , except when the redshift was less than 250 km s@xmath18 , in which case we used the distance quoted by the author . for two of these nearby galaxies , ugc 8091 ( dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1998 ) and ugc 12613 ( gallagher et al .",
    "1998 ) , recent distance estimates were significantly different from those reported in the hi paper , and we have adopted the newer values .",
    "the strong , one - to - one correlation between hi mass and cross - section over such a wide range of galaxy sizes and masses is somewhat surprising . at first glance , it suggests that all types of galaxies share the same surface density of hi .",
    "actually the data are a little more complicated to interpret , since the relationship is between the total hi , and the area of the disk that exceeds the relatively high surface density of @xmath30 @xmath5 .",
    "if all galaxies had their hi in exponential disks with varying scale lengths but the same central surface brightness , such a relationship would pertain , but clearly that is not a realistic description of galaxy hi distributions .",
    "we present here a few exploratory comments about the data presented in table a.2 to examine this correlation in greater detail .    for the central purpose of this paper",
    ", we focused on the relationship between the hi mass and the _ observed _ cross - section of hi on the sky .",
    "however , as we briefly noted in  2 , the observed cross - section is relatively independent of inclination .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : axrat ] , where we plot the ratio of observed to face - on cross sections above @xmath30 @xmath5 as a function of the observed axis ratio .",
    "the sample shown is the subset of galaxies from figure [ fig : massarea ] that also had inclination - corrected radial profile models .",
    "the cross - section does not simply decline as @xmath76 ( curve in figure ) , as would occur for a sharp - edged disk .",
    "because of the longer path length through the disk , the @xmath30 @xmath5 isophote shifts outward to a physically larger radius by an amount that depends on the scale - length of the hi distribution .",
    "the two effects nearly cancel for most inclinations , although edge - on galaxies do finally exhibit a significantly smaller cross - section .",
    "overall , the observed cross - sections are about 25% smaller , on average , than the inclination - corrected models predict for galaxies with axis ratios larger than @xmath77 .",
    "the scatter about the fit between mass and cross - sectional area improves slightly when we use azimuthally - averaged , inclination - corrected model results . using these face - on cross - sections yields a similar slope ( @xmath78 ) as we found using the observed cross - sections in a linear least squares fit ,",
    "although the intercept shifts because of the larger cross - section found on average for the face - on models .",
    "we will assume both actually have slope unity so that we can just compare the distribution of @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "for the 64 galaxies with measurements of both the face - on , @xmath80 , and observed dimensions , @xmath81 , the rms scatter of @xmath79 $ ] is 0.194 and 0.227 respectively .",
    "there seems to be little dependence with morphological type .",
    "if we use observed cross - sections for galaxies which are not highly inclined ( @xmath77 ) , we find the following results by morphological type :       the earliest - type galaxies ( sa  sb ) may have slightly lower values of @xmath79 $ ] than late - types , but the difference is marginal .",
    "this appears to be true for the s0 s as well , but our few examples have peculiar hi distributions , so any conclusions depend on whether the model or observed cross - sections are used , and whether outliers are rejected .",
    "while there may be some dependence on morphological type , the remarkable thing is how little variability there is between types over an enormous range of masses .",

    "<S> we present a study of the expected properties of the low redshift damped   absorber population determined from a sample of hi - selected galaxies in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> because of a tight correlation between the hi mass and hi cross - section , which we demonstrate spans all galaxy types , we can use our hi - selected sample to predict the properties of the absorption line systems . </S>",
    "<S> we use measurements of the number density and hi cross - section of galaxies to show that the total hi cross - section at column densities sufficient to produce damped  absorption is consistent with no evolution of the absorber population . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the @xmath0 distribution is dominated by galaxies with hi masses near 10@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the large dispersion in the correlation between hi mass and stellar luminosity , we find that the distribution of @xmath0 as a function of l@xmath2 is fairly flat . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we examine the line widths of the hi - selected galaxies and show that there may be evolution in the kinematics of hi - rich galaxies , but it is not necessary for the higher redshift population to contain a greater proportion of high mass galaxies than we find locally . </S>"
