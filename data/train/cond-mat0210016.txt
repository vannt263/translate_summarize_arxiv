    "the fabrication of thin films by deposition and evaporation of particles plays an important role in technological applications such as molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "theoretical studies of growing films are usually based on simplified models of interfaces evolving by certain stochastic dynamic rules .",
    "even simple solid - on - solid models may display very interesting features such as kinetic roughening , scaling , self - similarity , and fractal properties  @xcite .",
    "particularly fascinating are models with a roughening transition from a smooth phase , where the width of the interface is stationary and finite , to a rough phase , where the width grows continuously .",
    "roughening transitions may rely on different physical mechanisms .",
    "for example , kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) growth processes are known to exhibit a roughening transition in @xmath2 dimensions , which is caused by a competition of surface tension and the nonlinear term in the equation of motion .",
    "another class of roughening transitions , on which we will focus in the present work , occurs in certain deposition - evaporation processes with the special feature that atoms can not desorb from the middle of plateaus . in these models",
    "a completed layer , once formed , is stable and can not evaporate again .",
    "thus , if the growth rate is sufficiently small , the interface is smooth and fluctuates close to the lowest completed layer ( the so - called bottom layer of the interface ) , while for large deposition rate the growing islands coalesce so that the interface propagates and roughens continuously .",
    "a very simple model , which exhibits such a roughening transition , has been introduced some time ago by alon _",
    "et al . _",
    "the model is defined as a restricted solid - on - solid growth process with the special property that atoms can only evaporate only at the edges of plateaus .",
    "it turned out that the roughening transition in this model is driven by a directed percolation ( dp ) process at the bottom layer .",
    "dp is the standard universality class of phase transitions from a fluctuating phase into an absorbing state and occurs in unary reaction diffusion processes of the form @xmath3 , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "if the decay @xmath5 dominates the system eventually enters an absorbing state without particles from where it can not escape , while in the active phase the reaction @xmath3 is strong enough to sustain a stationary density of particles . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the sites at the bottom layer of the interface can be interpreted as particles of a dp process . using this relation the pinned phase , where the interface is smooth , corresponds to the active phase of dp .",
    "however , if the growth rate is increased above a certain critical threshold the dp process eventually enters the absorbing state , meaning that the bottom layer propagates by one step .",
    "the relation to dp allows one to predict some of the critical properties at the roughening transition .",
    "since the density of sites at the bottom layer  @xmath6 should scale in the same way as the particle density in dp , it is expected to decay at criticality as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is one of the universal critical exponent of dp . extending these arguments",
    "it has been shown that even the critical behavior at the first few layers above the bottom layer can be described in terms of a unidirectionally coupled hierarchy of dp processes  @xcite . roughly speaking each layer",
    "is associated with a separate dp process which is coupled to the dynamics at the layer below , while effective couplings in opposite direction turn out to be irrelevant in the renormalization group sense .",
    "more recently it became apparent that other universality classes of phase transitions into absorbing states can also be used to generate a roughening transition in an appropriately defined growth model .",
    "for example , the so - called parity - conserving ( pc ) class  @xcite , which is most prominently represented by branching - annihilating random walks with two offspring @xmath9 , @xmath1 , has been shown to generate a roughening transition in a simple model for dimer adsorption and desorption  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question arises whether it is possible to relate _ any _ universality class of absorbing phase transitions to a corresponding class of roughening transitions .    as a complete classification scheme of absorbing phase transitions",
    "is not yet available , it is an important task to search for other yet unknown types of transitions . in this context one of the most promising and controversially debated candidates is the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) @xmath10 in contrast to dp and pc transitions , where individual particles can generate offspring , the pcpd is a _ binary _ spreading process , i.e. , two particles have to meet in order to create a new one .",
    "although there is a still ongoing debate to what extent the pcpd represents a genuine independent universality class , there seems to be a general consensus that it displays a novel type of phase transition that has not been seen in other models  @xcite . in the numerically accessible temporal regime",
    "the transition is characterized by a fairly reproducible set of effective critical exponents . very recently",
    "kockelkoren and chat  @xcite carried out extensive simulations , reporting the estimates @xmath11 the purpose of this paper is to introduce a solid - on - solid growth process which exhibits a roughening transition driven by a _",
    "binary _ spreading process at the bottom layer . focusing on the one - dimensional case , where fluctuation effects are most pronounced , we demonstrate that the pair contact process with diffusion can indeed be used to generate a roughening transition in an appropriately defined model for interface growth .",
    "the dynamic rules of the model involve three different physical processes , namely , deposition of dimers , surface diffusion , and evaporation of diffusing monomers .",
    "the dimers are deposited horizontally on pairs of sites at equal height , leading to the formation of islands .",
    "these islands are stable in the interior but slightly unstable at the edges , where monomers are released at a certain rate",
    ". these monomers then diffuse on the surface until they either attach to another island or evaporate back into the gas phase . in what follows",
    "we consider the limit of a very high rate for evaporation . in this limit",
    "a released monomer is most likely to evaporate unless it immediately attaches to an _ adjacent _ island at the next site , effectively moving the hole between the two islands in opposite direction .    in more technical terms ,",
    "the model is defined on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site @xmath12 is associated with an integer height variable  @xmath13 .",
    "the model evolves by random - sequential updates , i.e. , a site @xmath12 is randomly selected and one of the following moves is carried out ( see fig .",
    "[ figrules ] ) :    * with probability @xmath14 a dimer is deposited horizontally provided that the two supporting sites have the same height : @xmath15 * with probability @xmath16 a monomer is released at the edge of a terrace .",
    "if there is no adjacent terrace , the released monomer evaporates immediately : @xmath17 & \\text { if } h_{i+1 } > h_{i } \\geq h_{i-1 } \\text { then } \\\\ & \\qquad h_{i+1}\\to h_{i+1}-1 \\end{split}\\ ] ] * otherwise the released monomer attaches to the opposite edge of the adjacent terrace : @xmath18 & \\text { if } h_{i+1 } > h_{i } < h_{i-1 } \\text { then } \\\\ & \\qquad   h_{i+1}\\to h_{i+1}-1;\\ ; h_{i}\\to h_{i}+1 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in addition , an attempted move is abandoned if the resulting configuration would violate the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) condition @xmath19 .",

    "typical interface configurations for various values of the growth rate  @xmath14 .",
    ", width=283 ]    the growth process defined above has the following phenomenological properties ( see fig .  [ figdemo ] ) .",
    "for small values of  @xmath14 occasionally deposited dimers will quickly desorb from the surface by evaporation at the edges so that the interface is smooth and fluctuates close to the bottom layer . as @xmath14",
    "is increased the islands grow and coalesce until their average size diverges at a certain critical point @xmath20 .",
    "above the critical point more and more islands are deposited on top of each other so that the interface roughens continuously .",
    "however , the interface remains pinned at solitary sites at the bottom layer , leading to the formation of pyramidial structures .",
    "these pyramids fluctuate so that the pinning sites slowly diffuse until they merge or annihilate .",
    "in contrast to the dimer model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite there is no evidence for a facetting transition at @xmath21 .    in order to explain how the growth model is related to the pcpd ,",
    "let us consider the dynamic processes at the bottom layer ( the spontaneously selected lowest height level of the interface ) .",
    "interpreting sites at the bottom layer as particles @xmath22 of a spreading process , the dynamic rules listed in fig .",
    "[ figrules ] can be associated with certain reactions of the particles .",
    "for example , the deposition of a dimer corresponds to pairwise annihilation @xmath1 , while evaporation of a monomer can be viewed as the creation of a particle @xmath22 .",
    "however , in the present model atoms can only evaporate at the edge of a terrace followed by two bottom layer sites , hence rule * ( b ) * in fig .",
    "[ figrules ] has to be interpreted as a fission process @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise , if there is only one such bottom layer site next to the edge , rule  * ( c ) * applies which corresponds to a random walk of a single particle @xmath22 .",
    "thus we may interpret the dynamics at the bottom layer as a reaction - diffusion process @xmath23 which resembles the dynamic rules of the pair contact process with diffusion in a fermionic realization .",
    "clearly , the relation between the growth model and the pcpd is not rigorous , especially because of deposition - evaporation processes on top of islands .",

    "we have estimated the critical exponents @xmath68 these exponents are in good agreement with recent estimates for the pcpd reported in  @xcite , confirming that the roughening transition is in fact driven by a pair conact process at the bottom layer . by comparing these exponents",
    "we implicitly assume that the pcpd is characterized by simple power - law scaling with well - defined critical exponents , a postulate which is still debated  @xcite . but even in terms of effective exponents the numerical results clearly confirm that the roughening transition in the proposed model is in fact driven by an underlying pair contact process with diffusion .    in the active phase of the pcpd the interface",
    "is smooth an pinned to the bottom layer , while it roughens in the inactive phase .",
    "since in the inactive phase of the pcpd the particle density decays algebraically as @xmath69 , the interface does not propagate uniformly , instead it remains pinned and becomes increasingly facetted . at criticality",
    "the interface width and the average height of the interface grow logarithmically with time or even slower . adopting the scaling picture outlined in ref .",

    "the present model does not exhibit a facetting transition . in the pc - driven case , where dimers are deposited _ and _ evaporated ,",
    "the facetting transition is related to a biased diffusion of steps along inclined parts of the interface with slope @xmath74 .",
    "such a step moves upward ( downward ) if a dimer is deposited ( evaporated ) so that for @xmath75 all terraces are swept to the top of the pyramids , stabilizing the facetted state . in the present model , where monomers evaporate instead of dimers",
    ", there is no such mechanism .    as in the case of dp- and pc - driven growth processes , the critical behavior at the first few layers above the bottom layer",
    "may be described by a unidirectionally coupled sequence of diffusive pair contact processes . in fact , the densities @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( not shown here ) display the same qualitative behavior as the particle densities in such a coupled hierarchy . however , a systematic study of a coupled sequence of pcpd s should be postponed until the pcpd itself is fully understood .",
    "the results of the present work suggest that any absorbing phase transition can be used generate a roughening transition in an appropriately defined growth process .",
    "for example , a generalization of the present model to a recently introduced triplet process  @xcite is straight forward .",
