    "since comets are remnants from the protoplanetary disk and the least processed bodies in the solar system , their composition and heterogeneity and their relation to their dynamical history help our understanding of the formation process of planetesimals and planets in the early solar nebula .",
    "one of the main goals of cometary studies is the determination of the composition of volatile species contained in the nucleus as ice . besides water ( h@xmath1o ) ,",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) , carbon dioxide ( co@xmath1 ) , and methanol ( ch@xmath6oh ) are the most abundant species in comet nuclei .",
    "they are the key species that provide constraints on a link between cometary volatiles and the interstellar precursor @xcite .",
    "there are generally two major dynamical groups for comets : jupiter family or ecliptic comets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and oort cloud comets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these two groups are expected to have different properties physically or chemically due to the difference in their birth places and evolutions .",
    "infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the chemical composition of comets and to derive information on the formation and evolution mechanisms and on the materials from which they originate .",
    "most parent molecules , which sublimate directly from the nucleus , have strong fundamental bands of vibration in the near - ir ( 2.55 @xmath0 m ) . h@xmath1o and",
    "co@xmath1 have the fundamental @xmath7 band at 2.66 and 4.26 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "co has the @xmath8(10 ) band at 4.67 @xmath0 m .",
    "although the near - ir region is partly accessible from the ground and advances in modern spectrometers with high spectral resolving powers have made a great progress in the study of h@xmath1o hot bands and organic molecules ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the most abundant parent molecules ( especially co@xmath9 ) are difficult to observe directly from the ground because they are also present in the terrestrial atmosphere and strong telluric absorption bands make the atmosphere completely opaque .",
    "symmetric molecules , such as co@xmath1 , do not have a permanent electric dipole moment and thus can not be observed even in the radio range from the ground .",
    "the advent of space missions allows us to study the emission from cometary volatiles in the entire 2.55 @xmath0 m region .",
    "parent co@xmath1 from the comet nucleus was detected in the coma of comet 1p / halley by the russian _",
    "space probe for the first time @xcite .",
    "since then , it has been directly observed in only three other comets : hale - bopp @xcite and 103p / hartley with _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) , and 9p / tempel with the _ deep impact _",
    "flyby spacecraft @xcite .",
    "with regard to imaging observations , _ spitzer space telescope _ also observes the cometary co and co@xmath1 in the near - ir with the infrared array camera ( irac ) .",

    "observations , both imaging and spectroscopy , of c / lulin were performed with _",
    "akari_/irc during this post - helium phase as part of the director s time observations .",
    "we have only several chances to observe this comet because _ akari _ has the visibility restriction of its solar elongation angle within @xmath10 deg .",
    "at the time of the observation , the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.70 au and a geocentric distance of 1.361.37 au .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out on 2009 march 30 at 15:53 ut .",
    "the ircz4 _ akari _ irc observing template ( aotz4 ) was used .",
    "the ng mode of ircz4 uses a near - ir grism ( 2.55 @xmath0 m ) , in which a target is located on the small @xmath11 aperture ( np ) for point - source grism spectroscopy .",
    "the effective spectral resolution is @xmath12 at 3.6 @xmath0 m for a point source in phase 3 .",
    "the spectral resolution is expected to be lower than this value for extended sources such as comets .",
    "raw data were processed through the irc spectroscopy toolkit for phase 3 data ( version 20090211 ) with the new spectral responsivity ( version 20091113 ) .",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum of the c / lulin was extracted with a pseudo aperture of 60@xmath1345 at @xmath14 west from the comet nucleus ( see figure [ lulin_img ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the east side coma to the nucleus is affected by the contamination of a background field star .",
    "we select this pseudo aperture position in order to avoid the opacity effect in the source ( see below ) .",
    "the corresponding aperture position for the spectrum extraction is depicted in figure [ lulin_img ] .",
    "imaging observations with aotz3 were performed on 2009 march 31 at 00:07 ut , which was 8 hr after the spectroscopic observations , yielding images of 1.92.8 ( n2 band ) , 2.73.8 ( n3 ) , and 3.65.3 ( n4 ) @xmath0 m for at least two dithered positions .",
    "the reference wavelengths of n2 , n3 , and n4 bands are 2.4 , 3.2 , and 4.1 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the data were processed with the irc imaging toolkit for phase 3 data ( version 20081015 ; see footnote 9 ) .",
    "the resultant irc image has a pixel size of @xmath15 and the fwhm of the image size is @xmath16 in phase 3 @xcite , corresponding to 1440 km and 4630 km at the geocentric distance of 1.36 au , respectively .",
    "the observation parameters are summarized in table  [ journal ] .",
    "the temperature of the telescope system and the irc during phase 3 is above 40 k and is gradually increasing .",

    "since both the n2 and n3 filters cover the 2.72.8 @xmath0 m region of h@xmath1o emission , the blue and green images resemble each other .    the _ akari _ spectrum of c / lulin is characterized by typical vibrational bands of parent molecules in the coma ( figure [ lulin_spc_1 ] ) . two strong @xmath7 bands of h@xmath1o at 2.66 @xmath0 m and co@xmath1 at 4.26 @xmath0 m are present in the _ akari _ spectrum of c / lulin .",

    "c / lulin was observed at 1.7 au of the heliocentric distance after the perihelion passage .",
    "since co is one of the highly volatile species in comet nuclei , co might be exhausted from the surface of the comet nucleus and highly depleted at the observation epoch , although such phenomena have not yet been reported .",
    "it is more probable that the depletion occurred if the comet nucleus condensed at moderately high nebular temperatures . in the present paradigm , comet formation in the early solar nebula extended over a wide range of the heliocentric distance both for oort cloud and jupiter - family comets @xcite",
    "this suggests that comets could display diversity in their chemical composition depending on the local temperature and nebular composition where they are formed @xcite .",
    "it is believed that oort cloud comets were formed in the giant planet region of the early solar nebula , although recent dynamical models suggest that comets now in the oort cloud were contributed in roughly equal numbers both from giant planet and the kuiper belt region @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to infer that c / lulin has a small fraction of co and co@xmath1 in its nucleus because it may originate from the region closer to the sun among the planetesimal formation cites .",
