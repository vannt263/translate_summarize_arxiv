    "x - ray studies of nearby normal galaxies ( without an active nucleus ) have established two primary components of the x - ray emission : discrete sources and diffuse hot gas .",
    "the discrete sources include low- and high - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs and hmxbs ) with @xmath1 . in early - type galaxies , except gas - rich , massive ellipticals , the overall x - ray luminosity is dominated by lmxbs , the integrated luminosity of which scales primarily with stellar mass ( gilfanov 2004 ) but also depends on stellar age ( zhang , gilfanov & bogdn 2012 ) . in late - type galaxies ,",
    "apart from lmxbs , hmxbs contribute to the bulk x - ray emission , whose total luminosity is roughly proportional to the star formation rate ( grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas traces the feedback from both young and old stellar populations ( core - collapsed and type ia sne , and winds from evolved stars ) and activity of the central super - massive black hole , which are believed to play a critical role in regulating the energy , mass , and metal transport , as well as the dynamics of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , strickland et al .",
    "2004 ; david et al .",
    "2006 ; li , wang & hameed 2007 ; fraternali & binney 2008 ; tang et al .",
    "2009a , b ) . studying the thermodynamic properties of hot gas in and around galaxies is crucial to our fundamental understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "however , studies of hot gas in most nearby galaxies have been challenging even with the bright sources detected and removed , because the seemingly diffuse x - ray emission must contain , and in some cases be dominated by , unresolved emission from faint stellar sources , whose contributions have not been carefully quantified until recently .",
    "these sources , mainly cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and coronally active binaries ( abs ) with @xmath2 , are shown to be responsible for the unresolved x - ray emission distributed over the inner region of our galaxy , the so - called galactic ridge x - ray emission ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "studies of the hot gas thus rely on a proper isolation of this stellar component , especially in the soft x - ray ( @xmath3 kev ) band , where the truly diffuse emission concentrates . however , since the x - ray emission of cvs and abs essentially arises from optically thin thermal plasmas with temperatures similar to that of the diffuse hot gas , it is not straightforward to separate the stellar and gaseous contributions spectroscopically , albeit the emission from cvs can be relatively harder ( e.g. heinke et al .",
    "2008 ) . on the other hand",
    ", one may expect that the stellar x - ray emission is approximately linearly proportional to the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "previous studies on the solar vicinity ( sazonov et al .",
    "2006 ) , the compact dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxy m32 ( revnivtsev et al . 2007 ) , the intermediate - mass , gas - poor elliptical galaxy ngc3379 ( revnivtsev et al . 2008 ) , and the outer bulge of the early - type spiral galaxy m31 ( li & wang 2007 ; bogdn & gilfanov 2008 ) showed that the cumulative x - ray luminosities per unit stellar mass ( i.e. , stellar x - ray emissivity ) from these galaxies / galactic regions agree within a factor of 2 with each other , suggesting a quasi - universal stellar x - ray emissivity ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "however , the number of cvs and abs found in the solar neighborhood is small and might be peculiar ; ngc3379 may contain a certain amount of hot gas given its moderate gravitational mass ( trinchieri et al .",
    "2008 ; bogdn et al .",
    "2012 ) ; the outer bulge of m31 is also likely to harbor some hot gas , although its contribution to the unresolved x - ray emission is small ( li & wang 2007 ) . perhaps m32 is the only _ bona fide _ gas - free host allowing for an accurate measurement of the stellar x - ray emissivity . indeed",
    ", the unresolved x - ray emission from m32 has been widely adopted in recent studies ( e.g. , boroson , kim & fabbiano 2011 ; li & wang 2013 ) to account for the contribution of cvs and abs in nearby galaxies , after scaling with the stellar mass .",
    "nevertheless , whether a quasi - universal stellar x - ray emissivity exists remains an open question .",
    "in this work we perform an x - ray study of three nearby des , ngc147 , ngc185 and ngc205 , in order to advance our knowledge of the stellar x - ray emissivity .",
    "these des are the best suitable targets in the local group to measure the cumulative x - ray emission of old stellar populations , since i ) they are not expected to confine a significant amount of hot gas , given their shallow gravitational potential ; ii ) they are not likely to have recent star formation and are therefore free of hmxbs , snrs , and pre - main sequence stellar objects that might contribute to the x - ray emission ; and iii ) they are however among the most massive dwarf galaxies in the local group and are located at appropriate distances so that good signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) are warranted and that the contribution of any bright lmxbs can be properly subtracted .    for comparison , we also study four galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , @xmath4 cen ( haggard et al . 2009 ) , 47 tuc ( heinke et al . 2005 ) , ngc6266 and ngc6397 ( bogdanov et al .",
    "2010 ) , which are among the x - ray brightest gcs and all have high quality x - ray data .",
    "compared to the typical stellar density of @xmath5 in the galactic fields ( e.g. , in the solar vicinity and in the des ) , the stellar density in the core of gcs can reach @xmath6 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , leading to an enhanced stellar encounter rate that may affect the number of x - ray sources ( pooley et al . 2003 ; pooley 2010 ) .",
    "the majority of x - ray sources in gcs are expected to be cvs and abs ( heinke 2010 ) , allowing for a direct comparison between their integrated x - ray emission and the unresolved x - ray emission from the des .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations and data reduction ; section 3 presents our data analysis and results ; section 4 compares the des , gcs and other old stellar systems in the scope of a quasi - universality of stellar x - ray emissivity and dynamical effects ; section 5 summarizes our findings .",
    "we utilized 4 _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations on the three des . among these , the deepest observation is obs .",
    "i d 0652210101 ( pi : z.li ) for ngc185 , which has an exposure of @xmath7115 ks ( @xmath785 ks after filtering the time intervals of high particle background ; table 1 ) , while other observations are from the _ xmm - newton _ archive .",
    "we used the science analysis system ( sas , version 13.0.0 ) , together with the corresponding calibration files for data reduction , following the procedures in li et al .",
    "point sources were detected in the @xmath8 kev band and removed in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the spectrum of the unresolved emission after removing the detected sources was extracted from the half - light ellipse ( with ks - band major - to - minor axis ratio and position angle from the 2mass large galaxy atlas ; jarrett et al .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from elliptical annuli surrounding the source region ( table 2 ) .",
    "we analyzed 9 archival _",
    "observations on the four gcs .",
    "we reprocessed the data using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao , version 4.5 ) software , following the procedures in li et al .",
    "point sources were detected in the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) kev for the acis - s ( acis - i ) data .",
    "the source detection limits are listed in column ( 8) of table 2 .",
    "we found no luminous lmxbs in these gcs ; all detected sources have luminosity @xmath11 , which are in agreement with previous work ( heinke et al . 2005 , haggard et al . 2009 , bogdanov et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we further examined the existence of bright sources that may dominate the total x - ray emission .",
    "the brightest source in 47 tuc contributes @xmath732% of the cluster s total x - ray flux , which was suggested to be a qlmxb ( heinke et al .",
    "however , the luminosity of this source lies within the range of typical cvs and abs , and would be unresolved if located in the des .",
    "therefore we retained this source for subsequent analysis .",
    "for each gc , the accumulated spectrum was extracted from within the half - light circle including detected sources and the unresolved emission , while the background spectrum was extracted from an annulus surrounding the source region and excluding detected point sources therein .",
    "table 1 gives a log of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    ".log of _ xmm - newton_/_chandra _ observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the above results for des and gcs are summarized in fig .  [",
    "f : emissivity ] which shows the soft x - ray ( @xmath3 kev ) emissivity versus the underlying stellar mass . for comparison",
    ", we also include literature studies on the solar vicinity ( sazonov et al .",
    "2006 ) , various nearby galaxies ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; bogdn & gilfanov 2011 ) and two galactic old open clusters ( ocs ; van den berg et al . 2013 ) .    for the galaxies , the contributions from bright x - ray sources , such as lmxbs and hmxbs , have been excluded .",
    "we emphasize that the importance of our sample of des lies in their low stellar masses ( @xmath12 ) and the probable absence of hot gas and young stellar populations ( davidge 2005 ) .",
    "compared to the des , the massive early - type galaxies ( red open circles in fig .",
    "5 ) show substantially higher soft x - ray emissivity , owing to the presence of a large amount of hot gas that often dominates the diffuse emission ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "the only exception is ngc3377 , which may be due to over - subtraction of the unresolved lmxb contribution , according to bogdn & gilfanov ( 2011 ) . both ngc3379 and",
    "the outer bulge of m31 show similar emissivities with the des , indicating that they harbor little , if any , truly diffuse hot gas ( bogdn & gilfanov 2011 ; bogdn et al .",
    "2012 ) . the irregular galaxies and most spiral galaxies ( blue crosses and diamonds in fig .  5 ) in the bogdn & gilfanov ( 2011 ) sample also exhibit higher emissivities , because part of their unresolved x - ray emission should originate from young stellar populations , and they also contain a significant amount of hot gas ( li & wang 2013 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray emissivities of the des are consistent with the cumulative emissivity ( @xmath13 ; green strip in fig .",
    "5 ) of abs and cvs in a normal galactic environment , i.e. , with stellar densities typical of the field .",
    "we calibrate this stellar x - ray emissivity by averaging over the four local group des ( ngc147 , ngc185 , ngc205 and m32 , and @xmath14 , which is converted from their @xmath15 kev emissivity through the best - fit model of m32 ( section 3.1 ) . ] ) , which results in , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 in which the first error term gives the statistical uncertainty in the x - ray flux measurement , and the second term accounts for the @xmath730% systematic uncertainty in the estimated stellar mass .      in fig .  5 , the two old ocs , m67 and ngc6791 ( van den berg et al . 2013 ) kev emissivities into the @xmath3 kev band through a 2 kev thermal plasma model . ] ,",
    "show substantially higher emissivities than the des and the solar vicinity , as well as the emissivities of the four gcs .",
    "the latter trend was also noted by verbunt ( 2001 ; figure 7 therein ) based on rosat observations of a sizable sample of gcs . as in gcs , the total x - ray emission of ocs is thought to be dominated by cvs and abs ( van den berg et al .",
    "2013 ) , thus their higher x - ray emissivity may be attributed to a higher binary fraction that resulted from such dynamical effects as mass segregation and evaporation ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "mass segregation causes heavy binaries to congregate at the cluster core , while the lighter single stars are expelled towards the periphery .",
    "evaporation causes high velocity , usually single stars to escape , resulting in a reduced cluster mass .",
    "we note , however , accurate measurements of binary fraction exist for only few ocs to date ( e.g. , sollima et al . 2010 ) , which do not include m67 and ngc6791 .",
    "on the other hand , the binary fraction in these ocs is on average marginally higher than that in the solar neighborhood ( 42% @xmath20 9% ; fischer & marcy 1992 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "gcs may also experience the above dynamical effects as in the ocs , but the relaxation time of gcs is much longer than that of ocs , so that those effects are weaker .",
    "in fact , three of the four gcs studied here show similar x - ray emissivities with the des ; only @xmath4 cen exhibits a significantly lower emissivity , but this cluster is often considered peculiar ( haggard , cool & davies 2009 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a large number of galactic gcs are found to have a relatively low binary fraction ( sollima et al .  2007 ;",
    "milone et al .",
    "2012 ; fig .  6 ) , consistent with the general idea that dynamical processes in gcs gradually lead to a net destruction of binaries ( e.g. , fregeau et al .",
    "2003 ; van den berg et al .",
    "2013 ) . of course",
    ", the gc x - ray emissivity may also depend on the types of binaries that give rise to the x - ray emission .",
    "the differences in the x - ray spectra of the gcs ( table 3 ) , for instance , may point at a different composition of the binary population compared to the field .",
    "a definite answer to whether and how the dynamical effects in gcs would lead to an enhanced or suppressed x - ray emissivity , compared to that in the field , awaits study of a sizable sample of the galactic gcs with sensitive x - ray observations .",
    "the stellar x - ray emissivity may also depend on other properties , such as stellar age and metallicity ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "for instance , the orbital periods and accretion rates of the binary stars evolve with time , which may depend on the stellar age .",
    "the metal lines provide a considerable contribution in the @xmath3 kev band , which should be scaled with the stellar metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , these relations can not be well constrained with the currently limited sample .",
    "9% ; fischer & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "the stellar mass is estimated from v - band luminosity with @xmath21 = 3 .",
    "none of the ocs and gcs in fig .",
    "[ f : emissivity ] , except ngc6397 , are included in this figure . ]",
    "we have investigated the unresolved x - ray emission in three local group des ( ngc147 , ngc185 and ngc205 ) using _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we have implemented in xspec a log - normal plasma temperature distribution model to fit the spectrum of the unresolved emission , and found similar cumulative x - ray emissivities among the des .",
    "the averaged x - ray emissivity , presumably originating from old stellar populations such as cvs and abs , is measured to be @xmath0 .",
    "this value is further compared to the cumulative x - ray emissivities of four gcs , of the solar vicintiy , old ocs and other galaxies from the literature .",
    "we verify previous suggestion that in normal galactic environments with stellar density typical of the field , there exists a quasi - universal x - ray emissivity of old stellar populations .",
    "it is important to take into proper account of this ubiquitous stellar component when one attempts to derive the density and temperature distributions of the tenuous , diffuse hot gas in nearby galaxies .",
    "we thank m. revnivtsev for valuable comments and the anonymous referee for suggestions that significantly improve our work .",

    "acknowledges support from the recruitment program of global youth experts .",
    "in previous studies ( e.g. , revnivtsev et al.2007 , 2008 ) , the spectrum of unresolved stellar x - ray emission was typically fitted by a single - temperature model , or a single - temperature plus power - law model . here",
    "we implement in xspec a log - normal temperature distribution model . in this model ,",
    "the distribution of temperature ( t ) follows a log - normal distribution , i.e. , log(t ) follows a normal / gaussian distribution . in astronomy , there are several applications of the log - normal distribution , e.g. , the log - normal period distribution of binary system with late - type stars ( kroupa 1995 ) , the log - normal initial mass function ( imf ) distribution ( zinnecker 1984 ) , the log - normal star formation history distribution of galaxies ( gladders et al .",
    "2013 ) and the log - normal distribution of the quiet - sun fuv continuum ( fontenla et al .",
    "the log - normal distribution is defined as , @xmath22 where a is the normalization , @xmath23 the peak temperature and @xmath24 the dispersion .",
    "the effective temperature of hot plasma in accreting cvs is related with the white dwarf mass ( aizu 1973 ) .",
    "a1 shows the mass distribution of cvs from ritter & kolb ( 2003 ) , which can be fit with a log - normal distribution . at a first approximation ,",
    "the temperature distribution is also a log - normal distribution .",
    "meanwhile , the single - temperature model can not fit the cumulative stellar emission well ( revnivtsev et al . 2007 ) , due to its multi - temperature nature .",
    "moreover , compared to a two - temperature model , in which at least four parameters ( two temperatures and two normalizations ) are needed , the log - normal temperature model has only three parameters .",
    "therefore , the log - normal temperature model is more physical yet simpler .",
    "a2 shows the log - normal temperature model with different @xmath24 in comparison with a single - temperature model .",
