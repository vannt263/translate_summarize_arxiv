    "hence , we can put them equal to zero from the beginning for simplicity .",

    "as such , its vacuum expectation value vanishes .",
    "this is the usual argument to prove the gauge parameter independence in the brst framework @xcite .",
    "note that no local operator @xmath148 , with @xmath149 , exists .",
    "furthermore , extending the action of the brst transformation on the @xmath150-field by @xmath151 one can easily check that @xmath152 so that we have a brst invariant @xmath150-action .",
    "thus , when we consider the vacuum , corresponding to @xmath153 , only the brst exact term in eq.([rge36 ] ) survives .",
    "the effective action @xmath104 is related to @xmath112 through a legendre transformation @xmath154 , while the effective potential @xmath155 is defined as @xmath156 if @xmath157 is the solution of @xmath158 , then it follows from @xmath159 , that @xmath160 and hence , @xmath161 or , due to eq.([rge36 ] ) , @xmath162 we conclude that the vacuum energy @xmath130 should be independent from the gauge parameter @xmath52 . +   + a completely analogous derivation was performed in the case of the linear gauge @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the previous argument , explicit results in that case showed that @xmath130 did depend on @xmath52 . in @xcite it was argued that this apparent disagreement was due to a mixing of different orders of perturbation theory .",

    "fortunately , we shall be able to prove that we can use the landau gauge as initial condition for the mag too .",
    "this will be the content of the next section .",
    "+   + before turning our attention to this task , it is worth noticing that , if one would work up to infinite order , the expressions ( [ rge53 ] ) and ( [ rge59bis ] ) can be transformed _",

    "in this section we shall introduce a generalized renormalizable gauge which interpolates between the mag and the landau gauge .",

    "+   + consider again the @xmath0 yang - mills action with the mag gauge fixing ( [ smn2 ] ) .",
    "for the residual abelian gauge freedom , we impose @xmath189 where @xmath190 is an additional gauge parameter .",

    "otherwise , for @xmath197 , the action @xmath199 of eq.([rge200 ] ) reduces to the one we are actually interested in and which we have discussed in the previous sections .",

    "the foregoing analysis is sufficient to make sure that we can use the landau gauge result for @xmath130 as the initial condition for the vacuum energy of the mag .",
    "moreover , we are now even in the position to answer the question about the existence of a fixed point of the rge for the gauge parameter @xmath52 , which was necessary to certify that no arbitrary constants would enter the results for @xmath130 .",
    "we already mentioned that the landau gauge , i.e. the case @xmath211 , is a renormalizable model @xcite , i.e. the landau gauge is stable against radiative corrections .",

    "indeed , the equations @xmath228 and @xmath229 , stemming from eq.([ex2 ] ) , are the same .",
    "moreover , we also notice that this equation has only complex valued solutions .",

    "one obtains @xmath232 it can be checked explicitly that @xmath231 obeys the renormalization group @xmath233 by using the rge functions ( [ ex1])-([ex4 ] ) and the fact that the anomalous dimension of @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 which is immediately verifiable from eq.([rge60 ] ) .",

    "let us consider the limit @xmath256 , corresponding to the `` real '' mag @xmath257 .",
    "one finds @xmath258 the relative smallness of @xmath239 means that our perturbative analysis should give qualitatively meaningful results .",
    "the aim of this paper was to give analytic evidence , as expressed by eq.([ex22 ] ) , of the dynamical mass generation for off - diagonal gluons in yang - mills theory quantized in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "this mass can be seen as support for the abelian dominance @xcite in that gauge .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the lattice version of the mag , were such a mass was also reported @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal lattice gluon propagator could be fitted by @xmath259 , which is in correspondence with the tree level propagator we find .",
    "we have been able to prove the existence of the off - diagonal mass by investigating the condensation of a mass dimension two operator , namely @xmath58 .",
    "it was shown how a meaningful , renormalizable effective potential for this local composite operator can be constructed . by evaluating this potential explicitly at 1-loop order in the case of @xmath212 , the formation of the condensate is favoured since it lowers the vacuum energy . the latter does not depend on the choice of the gauge parameter @xmath52 , at least if one would work to infinite order in perturbation theory .",
    "we have explained in short how to overcome the problem at finite order and gave a way to overcome it .",
    "moreover , we have been able to interpolate between the landau gauge and the mag by unifying them in a larger class of renormalizable gauges .",
    "this observation was used to prove that the vacuum energy of yang - mills theory in the mag due to its mass dimension two condensate should be the same as the vacuum energy of yang - mills theory in the landau gauge with the much explored condensate @xmath260 .",
    "it is worth noticing that all the gauges , where a dimension two condensate provides a dynamical gluon mass parameter , such as the landau gauge @xcite , the curci - ferrari gauges @xcite , the linear gauges @xcite and the mag , can be connected to each other , either directly ( e.g. landau - mag ) or via the landau gauge ( e.g. mag and linear gauges ) .",
    "this also implies that , if @xmath60 in the landau gauge , the analogous condensates in the other gauges can not vanish either .",
