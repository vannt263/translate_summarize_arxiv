    "this is an important characteristic of phase coherence in the ground state associated with simultaneous coherent pairing of independent charge and spin ( fermion ) entities and their corresponding full bose - einstein condensation ( real - space pairing ) with a single energy gap .",
    "such behavior is similar to the coherent pairing with unique quasiparticle gap in conventional bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the coherent pair formation through _ separate _ condensation of bound holes and coupled opposite spins ( both bosons ) at different critical temperatures @xmath75 and @xmath76 in real space here is somewhat different from the cooper pairs ( composite bosons ) condensation in momentum space with the unique critical temperature .",
    "the magnitudes of the spin pseudogap and charge gap also differ with increasing temperature here , unlike in the bcs case .",
    "it is consistent with arpes data that excitations in high @xmath1 superconductors ( as in the exact solution ) are not well defined quasiparticles as it is in the bcs theory  @xcite .    in the positive charge gap @xmath0 region(s ) ,",
    "the behavior of states near @xmath70 is different from the above due to the presence of a spin - charge separation effect  @xcite in the ground state that carries a nonzero total spin , @xmath77 .",

    "it turns out that , depending on the value of @xmath0 due to level crossings , certain competing states with high or low ( total ) spin can become the ground state .",
    "hence , we define a _",
    "canonical _ spin gap @xmath39 as the energy difference between the ground state with spin @xmath66 and the lowest excited state with spin @xmath79 having the same @xmath31 and @xmath0 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the canonical energy of an @xmath31 electron state with total spin @xmath66 at rather low temperature @xmath32 .",
    "if the excited state has a higher ( lower ) total spin , the spin gap is positive ( negative ) .",
    "this gap ( along with its sign ) identifies whether a high or low spin state turns out to be the lowest average energy state ( or ground state at @xmath42 ) .",
    "in addition , the ground state here can be described as a spin liquid due to the spin degeneracy ( 2@xmath66 + 1 ) , which can be lifted by infinitesimal @xmath82 .",
    "one other noteworthy point is that , in the 8-site betts lattice , there are several @xmath0 values ( qcps ) at which such level crossings occur ( from low - spin to high - spin or vice versa ) near @xmath70 . those are denoted by @xmath83 ( spin 0 to 3/2 ) , @xmath51 ( from spin 3/2 to 5/2 ) ( see fig .

    "this crossover is a smooth second order transition for the onset of pairing instabilities at finite temperatures . for a given @xmath32 , the magnitude and area of the negative gap region",
    "are an indication of the pairing strength and the region of the phase separation instability ; this magnitude and area shrink and disappear at relatively low temperature , indicating that the pairing and phase separation instability is a low temperature phenomenon .",
    "the solid boundary line evolves smoothly with temperature and approaches the qcps , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as temperature goes to zero , @xmath42 .",
    "exactly at @xmath61 , this picture shows the region @xmath88 for coherent pairing .",
    "the negative gap region defines first order phase separation instabilities , while the positive gap is a signature for smooth second order transitions .",

    "this picture describes the transition from incoherent charge pairing of preformed electron ( hole ) pairs with decoupled spin into a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "thus , the continuous transition at the classical critical temperatures here from one , ordered , low - temperature phase into another ( quantum ) ordered high temperature phase is somewhat different from the conventional phase boundary described by an order parameter , which is non - zero in the ordered phase and zero in the disordered high temperature phase .",
    "note , that the high temperature insulating phase in figure  [ fig : cgaptn0 ] at @xmath89 in @xmath44 region originates from the low temperature ( quantum ) mott - hubbard phase at @xmath65 .",

    "[ nnn ] in many real materials ( such as the cuprates ) , the contribution of hopping among next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) atoms can be important due to many reasons , such as its ability to separate hole and electron doped properties by breaking particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "experimental results strongly support the idea that holes in cuo@xmath96 planes are mainly sited in the @xmath97 cu orbital in related undoped insulating materials , and additional holes are transferred mainly to the oxygen p orbitals upon doping .",
    "the next - nearest coupling term has already been invoked to explain the shapes of the fermi surfaces obtained from recent band - structure calculations for these new superconducting materials .",
    "the two orbital hubbard model with p - bonding orbitals , after elimination of the cu sites , can be reduced to a single - orbital hubbard model with nearest and next - nearest - neighbor couplings ( [ su0 ] ) by allowing holes to move within a given oxygen sublattice .",

    "in this section , we discuss the effects due to a nonzero @xmath8 . because @xmath8 in real material is usually much smaller than @xmath2 parameter we only show results for @xmath99 . below we will find conditions under which broken @xmath100 symmetry in frustrated betts cells with @xmath98 can be harmful or favorable for pair binding .    at zero temperature ,",

    "the bold line in figure  [ fig : nnnt0 ] shows where the charge gap becomes zero , which defines a boundary between charge pair phase and electron - hole pairing phase .",
    "as @xmath8 increases from negative ( opposite sign as that of @xmath2 ) to positive ( same sign as that of @xmath2 ) , the boundary shifts to larger @xmath0 values and the magnitude of the gap also becomes larger .",
    "this can be explained by the effects of @xmath8 on the ground state with holes .",
    "the hopping between next nearest neighbors are energetically unfavorable for the half - filled antiferromagnetic state since the next nearest neighbors have the same spin direction .",
    "when holes are created in the antiferromagnetic background , hopping between next nearest neighbors will become more active and will have a measurable effect on the ground state . depending on the sign of @xmath8 , it will make the ground state with holes higher ( @xmath10 ) or lower ( @xmath9 ) in energy .",
    "therefore a positive @xmath8 makes hole - hole pairing ( charge pairing ) ground state more energetically favorable and enhances the negative charge gap . in spite of this introduced frustration in the square system , pairing can be enhanced by appropriate sign of the next - nearest - neighbor coupling ( @xmath9 ) .    at fixed @xmath0 ,",

    "figure  [ fig : tpfixu ] also shows that the linear slope approaches zero as the magnitude of the gap approaches its maximum ( antinode ) value ( around @xmath105 ) , which indicates that , although negative @xmath8 drives charge pairing crossover point to smaller @xmath0 values , it does not affect the maximum gap value significantly .     for different @xmath0 and @xmath8 at @xmath61 .",

    "an important question is whether the obtained electron instabilities will continue to exist in the two - dimensional lattice as the cluster size increases , especially , in the thermodynamic limit .",
