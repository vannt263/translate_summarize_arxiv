    "stars form by the gravitational collapse of dense cores in molecular clouds .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution of dense cores is thus a necessary prerequisite to the understanding of the origin of stellar masses , multiple systems , and outflows . over the past decade ,",
    "observational studies of ( low - mass ) dense cores have made significant progress ( see , e.g. , reipurth et al .",
    "2007 for recent reviews ) . representing the earliest phase of star formation ,",
    "both prestellar and protostellar cores have been extensively observed and studied using large ( sub)millimeter telescopes ( e.g. , jcmt and iram-30 m ) and infrared telescopes ( e.g. , _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ ) . in practice , however , it is still difficult to distinguish the two types of cores because of the lack of readily observable differences between them",
    ". this is illustrated by the fact that several ",
    "prestellar \" cores , like l1014 , were found to harbor very low - luminosity protostars in sensitive @xmath0 observations ( see young et al .",
    "2004 ) . consequently ,",
    "despite all of the observational advances in the past decade , we still do not have a good understanding of the evolutionary process that turns a prestellar core into a protostar .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the collapse and evolution from prestellar cores to class0 protostars have been long studied since the pioneering work of larson ( 1969 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations and simulations in fact predict two successive collapse phases , before and after the dissociation of molecular hydrogen , resulting in two different hydrostatic objects ( see , e.g. , larson 1969 ; masunaga et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; andr et al .",
    "the collapsing prestellar core is initially optically thin to the thermal emission from dust grains , and the compressional heating rate by the collapse is much smaller than the cooling rate by the thermal radiation .",
    "the collapse is therefore isothermal at the very beginning .",
    "this condition is broken when the compressional heating rate surpasses the radiative cooling rate , and the central temperature increases gradually above 10k .",
    "the collapse is then decelerated and forms a shock at the surface of a quasi - adiabatic hydrostatic object , the so - called  first hydrostatic core \" or  first core \" , which consists mainly of hydrogen molecules .",
    "the inward motion at this phase is called the  first collapse \" .",
    "when the central temperature reaches about 2000k , hydrogen molecules begin to dissociate into atoms , which acts as an efficient coolant of the gas .",
    "when released gravitational energy is consumed by the dissociation , the gas pressure can not increase rapidly enough to support the first core against its self - gravity , the  second collapse \" begins . after the dissociation",
    "is completed , the  second core \" , a truly hydrostatic protostellar object , forms in the center .",
    "most , if not all , class0 protostars observed so far actually belong to the population of the  second cores \" ( ph .",
    "andr , private communication ) .",
    "intermediate between the prestellar and class0 protostellar phases , the first core is a transient object accreting from the surrounding dense envelope ; the lifetime of the first core is calculated to be only 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 years ( boss & yorke 1995 ; masunaga et al .",

    "( 1998 ) modelled the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the first core , and found that it should have an extremely low bolometric luminosity ( @xmath20.1@xmath3 ) , and have no detectable infrared emission at wavelengths shorter than @xmath630@xmath1 m with current telescopes .",
    "furthermore , recent magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations have found that the first core can even drive a molecular outflow before the formation of the second core ( i.e. , protostar ) ( tomisaka 2002 ; banerjee & pudritz 2006 ; machida et al .",
    "therefore , the observational detection of the first core would not only confirm the predictions of rhd models but also set strong constraints on mhd models of protostellar outflows .",

    "however , no compact infrared emission was detected from l1448 irs2e in any of the @xmath0 bands ( from 3.6 to 70@xmath1 m ; see figs.1a-1d ) , suggesting that this source is extremely cold .",

    "we therefore consider irs2 as a single source here .",
    "in fact , the structures of the outflow from irs2 can be explained without the need to invoke the unseen binary companion ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "most of the structures seen at redshifted velocities appear to delineate the walls of the 50 deg - wide outflow cavities , while the elongated redshifted emission along the outflow axis most probably traces the dense collimated part of the outflow , as seen in other sources ( e.g. , santiago - garca et al .",
    "2009 ) and predicted by so - called ` unified ' outflow model ( e.g. , shang et al .",

    "figure  4 shows the velocity - integrated intensity map of the sma @xmath16co(21 ) emission of l1448 irs2e and irs2 . to the south of irs2e , the collimated redshifted co lobe ( @xmath640@xmath9 or 9600au in length )",

    "the orientation and morphology of this co lobe suggest that it is neither part of the cavity wall of the irs2 extended outflow nor part of the molecular jet from irs2 .",
    "these results indicate that l1448 irs2e , a cold core with no detectable infrared emission , is driving a molecular outflow . nevertheless , further observations , e.g. , short - spacing data , are needed to recover the missing flux of extended structure , and to improve the quality of the outflow maps .    assuming that the @xmath16co(21 ) line emission is optically thin , the outflow mass of l1448 irs2e is derived with the standard manner ( e.g. , cabrit & bertout 1990 ) . in the calculations ,",
    "we assume lte conditions and an excitation temperature of 20k ( the values in the range of 10@xmath1350k modify the calculations by less than a factor of 2 ) .",

    "since there is no local emission peak at the position of the sma compact source in the scuba / bolocam images ( see fig.2 ) , the estimated fluxes per beam around irs2e in these images represent conservative upper limits to the fluxes from the embedded source .",
    "the 3@xmath18 upper limits in the @xmath0 images are also listed in table  1 .",
    "based on these data points , we constructed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of irs2e ( plot not shown here ) . to estimate the luminosity of irs2e , we first interpolated and then integrated the sed ( all the upper limits were used ) , always assuming spherical symmetry .",

    "the estimated bolometric luminosity of l1448 irs2e is less than 0.1@xmath3 .",
    "although only an upper limit to the bolometric luminosity could be derived , we can still use it to further constrain the evolutionary stage of l1448 irs2e . if we assume a steady mass - accretion rate given by @xmath34=0.975@xmath42/@xmath43 ( shu 1977 ) , where @xmath44 is the effective sound speed , for a gas temperature of 10k the accretion rate is @xmath62@xmath1710@xmath36@xmath23yr@xmath12 .",

    "encouraged by these facts , searches for the first core have been undertaken over the past decade . based on the hco@xmath57/h@xmath60co@xmath57 observations , onishi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that l1521f could be a first core candidate , but @xmath0 observations soon found that l1521f harbors a low luminosity protostar ( bourke et al .",
    "more recent studies suggest that the evolutionary stage of l1521f is similar to or younger than the class0 phase , and may be consistent with the early second collapse phase ( shinnaga et al .",
    "2009 ; terebey et al .",
    "another promising object was cha - mms1 , suggested by belloche et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the measurement of the deuterium fractionation .",
    "however , a mid - infrared source was detected by @xmath0 mips observations , indicating a compact hydrostatic object had already formed in cha - mms ( see belloche et al .",
    "2006 for more details ) .",
    "based on the sma and @xmath0 observations , we find that source l1448 irs2e has the following characteristics : ( 1 ) it is not visible in the sensitive @xmath0 infrared images ( from 3.6 to 70@xmath1 m ) ; ( 2 ) has very weak ( sub-)mm dust continuum emission , and consequently has an extremely low bolometric luminosity ( @xmath20.1@xmath3 ) ; and ( 3 ) appears to drive a molecular outflow .",
    "comparisons with prestellar cores and class0 protostars suggest that l1448 irs2e is more evolved than prestellar cores but less evolved than class0 protostars , i.e. , at a stage intermediate between prestellar cores and class0 protostars .",
    "these results are consistent with the theoretical predictions in the rhd / mhd models for the first hydrostatic core ( see sectioni)3kms@xmath12 . however , in their models the first core only has a mass of 0.01@xmath23 at the end of the calculations . since the first core will grow in mass by at least 12 orders of magnitude in the subsequent gas accretion phase , the relatively high outflow velocity of l1448 irs2e ( @xmath625kms@xmath12 ; about 8 times larger than that in the model ) could be explained by the relatively larger ( gas ) mass of the l1448 irs2e core ( @xmath60.04@xmath23 ) , i.e. , a deeper gravitational potential and a faster escape speed .",
    "] , making l1448 irs2e the most promising first hydrostatic core candidate thus far .",
    "however , it must be noted that the nature of source l1448 irs2e is not definitive .",
    "more observations are needed to constrain its sed and to refine its outflow maps .",
    "detections of other objects like l1448 irs2e will be important for understanding the process of dynamical collapse and the origin of outflows .",
    "sensitive surveys at wavelengths from far - infrared ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) to ( sub-)mm continuum ( e.g. , scuba ) are needed to search for more first core candidates in nearby clouds .",
    "we also speculate that some of the objects in the current sample of prestellar cores may already harbor first cores , which drive molecular outflows hidden within the extended cloud emission and are therefore not revealed in low resolution single - dish observations .",
    "a systematic high - resolution interferometric co survey toward these cores is needed to search for potential outflow activity .",
    "we present sma and @xmath0 observations of the low - mass , embedded dense core l1448  irs2e .",
    "this core has no point - like infrared emission in the @xmath0 images , and shows weak emission in the sma 1.3 mm dust continuum map ( @xmath66mjy ) .",
    "consequently , it has an extremely low bolometric luminosity ( less than 0.1@xmath3 ) .",
    "interestingly , the sma co(21 ) images suggest that l1448 irs2e is driving a collimated co outflow ( up to @xmath625kms@xmath12 ) , which is further supported by the @xmath0 irac images with regards to the morphology of the outflow .",
    "irs2e represents so far the lowest luminosity source with a detectable molecular outflow .",
    "a comparison with prestellar cores and class0 protostars suggests that l1448 irs2e is in an evolutionary stage between that of a prestellar core and a class0 protostar .",
    "our results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical models for the first hydrostatic core , making l1448 irs2e thus far the most promising first hydrostatic core candidate .",
    "further observations , such as _ herschel space observatory _ imaging at 75@xmath13300@xmath1 m and short - spacing co observations , are needed to study its properties and to address more precisely its evolutionary status .",
    "if the properties of l1448 irs2e are validated by further observations , this would be the first confirmed detection of the first core stage of star formation .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for many insightful comments and suggestions .",
    "we acknowledge the sma staff for technical support during the observations and the @xmath0 science center for their maintenance of the @xmath0 data .",
