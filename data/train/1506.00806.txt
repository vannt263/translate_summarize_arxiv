    "the objective of this paper is to build financial crisis indicators capable of producing a useful forecast of future market events .",
    "the goal that we set for this study is _ not _ to predict the actual occurrence of financial crises .",
    "what we aim to achieve is rather to be able to evaluate at a given date whether the probability of a financial crisis happening at the given time horizon is getting higher , because the market conditions are ripe for a random adverse event from inside or even outside the market , to trigger a destructive chain reaction .",
    "examples of random events capable of triggering a financial crisis are many .",
    "it may take the form of the sudden failure of a critical company , the publishing of new macro - economic data , a sovereign state defaulting on its debt , a major political event or even a terrorist attack . to use an analogy",
    ", we do not pretend to be able to predict the exact moment when a random spark will ignite the gas in the room , but we can measure whether the gas concentration in the room is just right for a random spark to cause a disaster . since random adverse events",
    "happen all the time , measuring whether the conditions are just right in the market for one such event to trigger a crisis should be statistically equivalent to forecasting the actual occurrence of financial crises . + we build nine original financial crisis indicators which are divided into two kinds : those that study the distribution of the whole spectrum of the covariance matrix and compare it to a reference distribution and those that compute a specific spectral property ( namely the trace and the spectral radius ) of the covariance , correlation and weighted correlation matrix .",
    "both kinds of indicators rely on the study of the underlying correlation and volatility signals inside the market .",
    "this is a novel approach because , while many different kinds of financial crisis indicators do exist in the literature , we are not aware of any that use reference distributions to compare the empirical spectrum of the covariance matrix to , nor any that use a modified version of the correlation matrix where the assets have been weighted with respect to the market capitalization of the corresponding companies or the daily traded volume .",
    "this approach enables us to maximize the amount of information coming from the market that is used by the financial crisis indicators , with the goal of boosting their predictive power .",
    "we work with seven datasets , each one designed with its own unique composition characteristics .",
    "this provides us with original results about many different financial markets from north america to emerging countries .",
    "+ there is a large literature on financial crisis forecasting , especially works by sornette ( 2009 ) , sornette and johansen ( 2010 ) , jiang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and maltritz ( 2010 ) , which aim at producing a comprehensive model comprising the genesis , dynamics and eventual prediction of financial crises , especially using the powerful tools of time - series analysis .",
    "network theory has also been successfully applied to financial crisis forecasting and the building of financial crisis indicators as in celik and karatepe ( 2007 ) or niemira and saaty ( 2004 ) .",
    "a machine learning approach , based on k - means clustering , to forecasting financial turmoil , and especially sovereign debt crises , has been developed in fuertes and kalotychou ( 2007 ) who also demonstrated that combining multiple forecasting methods improves the quality of the predictions , as clemen ( 1989 ) had underlined in a review and annotated bibliography about combining forecasts . cross sectional time series analysis in a panel data framework was studied in van den berg et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to predict financial crises while bussiere and fratzscher ( 2006 ) chose to develop early warning systems of financial crises based on a multinomial logit model .",
    "demyanyk and hasan ( 2010 ) summarized the results provided by several prediction methods of financial crises , and especially bank failures , based on economic analysis , operations research and decision theory , while drehmann and juselius ( 2014 ) proposed detailed evaluation criteria of the performance of early warning indicators of banking crises .",
    "financial crisis forecasts can also be based on the quantitative study of any kind of qualitative macro - economic data like the fomc minutes , or any other qualitative forecasts .",
    "that approach was developed by stekler and symington ( 2016 ) as well as ericsson ( 2016 ) .",
    "its main limitation resides in the quality of the qualitative forecasts and the fomc for example did not predict the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis in advance nor did it identify it quickly as a major systemic event . from another point of view , gugan ( 2008 ) used chaos theory and data filtering techniques to make market forecasts .",
    "the approach that we adopt is more modest in the sense that we do not pretend to explain the precise macro - economic mechanism that creates the many different kinds of financial crises and to predict the precise date of the next crisis .",
    "the ambition of this work is merely to detect a heightened risk of a crisis happening , not to predict its actual occurrence .",
    "the approach we adopt is closer to the work of sandoval junior and de paula franca ( 2012 ) who proved in their paper , using random matrix theory techniques , that high volatility in financial markets is intimately linked to strong correlations between those financial markets . + nonetheless , sandoval junior and de paula franca only used the marchenko pastur distribution in their work , while we intend to build and use additional distributions in the framework of random matrix theory .",
    "we also address internal correlations within the financial markets and not just the correlations between market indices .",
    "those new distributions are numerically computed as closed form formulas for them do not exist to our knowledge .",
    "they are introduced in order to escape the restrictive framework of marchenko - pastur s theorem , which assumes uncorrelated gaussian components .",
    "indeed , the empirical covariance matrix of assets inside a market in turmoil is dominated by strong correlation and a non - gaussian distribution of the log - returns .",
    "of course , the objectives of this study are also very different , since we attempt to build empirical financial crisis indicators , which are almost ready for use by practitioners , while sandoval junior and de paula franca were concerned with proving a result about volatility and correlation reinforcing their effects during a financial crisis . + the approach and methods used in this study are also close to the work of bouchaud , potters and laloux ( 2005 and 2009 ) . indeed , in their 2005 physics paper and 2009 review",
    ", they apply random matrix theory and principal component analysis to the financial context in order to anticipate market events and produce optimal portfolio allocations as well as risk estimations . their idea to use , like sandoval junior and de paula franca , the marchenko pastur distribution as a reference distribution to which they compare empirical spectra is similar to the framework that we have developed but they use an exponentially weighted moving averages in place of the rolling matrix that we work with .",
    "the work of singh and xu ( 2013 ) and of snarska ( 2007 ) about the dynamics of the covariance matrix in a random matrix theory framework was also inspirational to us .",
    "indeed , the approach we select uses as well rolling windows for dynamic correlation and covariance matrices . exploiting the spectra of those matrices forms the very foundation of the framework of this study .",
    "+ we can also see the financial crisis indicators that we build as _ market instability indicators_. indeed , they are able to say at a given date whether the probability of occurrence of a financial crisis within a given time horizon has increased , while it is still possible that the probability of nothing happening remains very high .",
    "in particular , one possible limitation of our approach is the relatively high ratio of false positives .",
    "there is still usually a high probability that nothing will happen , even when the indicators return red flags . from a practitioner s point of view , the information that the probability of a crisis occurring in the near future has risen from , say , 0.1% to 10% has tremendous value , even though there is still a 90% chance of nothing happening . for us ,",
    "a financial crisis indicator is a tool that makes use of publicly available data to determine whether the market conditions , measured by taking into account both correlation and volatility , are ripe in the market for a crisis event to happen .",
    "+ the robust methods used in this paper are applied to an intuitive principle of financial economics : when correlations between asset returns increase and develop abnormal patterns , when volatility goes up , then something is not right inside the market and a financial crisis event might be around the corner .",
    "any kind of market data can be used within the framework that we created .",
    "depending on the order of magnitude and scope of the financial crises that we intend to forecast , we have the freedom to choose the geographical characteristics of the data .",
    "indeed , we can use prices time series restricted to assets located in one given country , one region or the whole world .",
    "the nature of the data can also be freely defined depending on the nature of the crisis events that we plan on forecasting .",
    "stock prices and equity index prices , as well as sector indices may be used to forecast stock market crashes .",
    "foreign exchange ( fx ) spreads may be used to forecast primarily monetary crises , and the methods that we develop provide a complementary point of view to the work of gugan and ielpo ( 2011 ) who used time - series models to forecast monetary policy .",
    "however , we are not limited to any asset class .",
    "we may also use bond yields , commodity prices or credit default swaps ( cds ) spreads . finally , it is possible to choose the frequency of the data and adapt it to reflect the kind and scope of the financial crises that we aim at forecasting , the only limitation being data availability .",
    "+ in this paper , we chose to mainly focus on global financial crises , most of which are well known to the general public and the he data has been selected accordingly .",
    "the code has been written using matlab and its various optional toolboxes .",
    "the reader is very much encouraged to apply the methods developed in this paper to their own datasets and to verify the reproducibility of their forecasting power to various kinds and scopes of financial crises using data from many different kinds of asset classes and of various frequencies .",
    "we look forward to feedback and comments . + we propose in this paper a new approach regarding early warning financial crisis indicators that we then illustrate using many different datasets of market data .",
    "we also demonstrate the ability of the methods that we develop to make out of sample predictions . from our point of view",
    ", it seems that no such work has been published before with the same objectives and methodology .",
    "therefore , we can not compare quantitatively in terms of accuracy and predictive power the results that we have obtained to other existing studies .",
    "the work of bouchaud , potters and laloux ( 2005 and 2009 ) uses a methodology that is similar to the one we chose , however we did not find detailed empirical results for their work , that would have been suitable for comparison in a robust way with the numerical results that we have obtained in this study .",
    "+ besides the present introduction and a general conclusion , the paper is divided into four parts .",
    "we first describe how we built , collected and processed the databases .",
    "indeed , their quality and diversity constitutes a major part of the interest of the study we conducted . in a second part",
    ", we detail the methodology and then we build the financial crisis indicators . the third part is dedicated to the qualitative analysis of the results provided by the financial crisis indicators over the whole length of the datasets . finally ,",
    "in the fourth part , we demonstrate the predictive power of the approach we developed by selecting two of the best performing financial crisis indicators applied to the largest and most detailed dataset that we possess . after dividing the data between an in - sample and an out of sample period",
    ", we study in details the forecasting possibilities they provide , firstly by using fixed dates of known financial crises and then by quantitatively defining a financial crisis in terms of the crossing of a chosen maximum draw down threshold .",
    "the data is constituted at each date of the log - returns with respect to the previous trading day , computed from open or close prices .",
    "the prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits beforehand .",
    "we have chosen daily data for this study because of easy access and faster numerical handling .",
    "further studies may explore higher frequency data .",
    "the model that we develop requires the choice of a rolling window in order to compute the financial crisis indicators . in order to limit averaging effects and to have financial crisis indicators with enough responsiveness to provide useful information to a practitioner",
    ", we chose the size of the rolling window to be 150 days in the past .",
    "this represents roughly six months of trading since we only take trading days into account . using a relatively large rolling window",
    "means that the covariance matrix will be degenerate sometimes since there will be more observations than assets .",
    "this fact however is not going to be a problem because for the first type of indicators , the distance between the empirical distribution and the reference will be computed after truncating the empirical distribution around zero and making it stick to the reference in order to eliminate the contribution of the small eigenvalues . the motivations for this operation will be explained in the next section where the methodology that we use is explained in detail . for",
    "the second type of indicators , the presence of zeros , even quite a lot of them , in the spectrum will not change anything for the computation of the trace and spectral radius .",
    "+ seven datasets , each designed with its own unique properties and composition are considered in this study :    * the first dataset ( dataset 1 ) is constituted of eleven stock indices representative of the asian , european and american financial markets in order to obtain a picture of the global financial system .",
    "it is a pure equity dataset that is designed to capture contagion between major financial markets as a way to forecast financial crises .",
    "it contains the nikkei225 ( nky , japan ) , hang seng ( hsi , hong - kong / china ) , taiwan stock exchange weighted index ( twse , taiwan ) for the asian market , the dax30 ( dax , germany ) , ftse100 ( ukx , u.k ) , ibex35 ( ibx , spain ) for the european market , the sp500 ( spx , u.s.a ) , russel3000 ( ray , u.s.a ) , nasdaq ( ccmp , u.s.a ) , dow jones industrial average ( indu , u.s.a ) , sp / tsx composite index ( sptsx , canada ) for the north american market . dataset 1 spans from january 7th 1987 to february 5th 2015 . in order to avoid contaminating the data with time differences which might create bias and spurious correlations , we matched at a same date @xmath0 the close price in asia at @xmath0 , the close price in europe at @xmath0 and the open price in america ( east coast ) at @xmath0 . in the absence of intraday data , this appeared to be a reasonable choice .",
    "we considered only the trading days and because of the different holidays specific to each of the three markets considered ( asian , european and north american ) and the requirement to keep only the trading days that were common to all the markets , the 252 trading days a year have been reduced to around 200 dates .",
    "comparison with the other datasets ( particularly dataset 3 and dataset 4 below which do have around 250 entries a year since they are exclusively american and european , respectively ) shows that this is not a major issue in practice . * the second datastet ( dataset 2 ) is constituted of sixteen assets .",
    "it contains all of the indices of dataset 1 , some commodity indices and some safe haven or cash equivalent securities toward which investors tend to turn in a time of crisis or impending crisis .",
    "it spans the same period as dataset 1 , from january 7th 1987 to february 5th 2015 .",
    "the treatment of the data with regard to time differences between geographical regions and non - trading days is the same . on top of the content of dataset 1 ,",
    "dataset 2 includes : the london gold market fixing index ( goldlnpm , u.k ) , the philadelphia stock exchange gold and silver index ( xau , u.s.a ) , oppenheimer limited - term government fund class a ( opgvx , u.s.a ) , sugar generic future contract ( sb1 , u.s.a ) , generic first crude oil wti ( cl1 , u.s.a ) . the inclusion of precious metal indices , cash equivalent short - government monetary funds , representative agricultural as well as energy commodities ( in the form of investable futures ) is supposed to provide a longer fuse to the financial crisis indicators . as a matter of fact , when the market starts to overheat",
    ", investors may liquidate some of their equity positions but they will have to re - invest the cash somewhere and those cash equivalent securities are here to account for that .",
    "since those safer , cash equivalent securities are in dataset 2 , we anticipate that the risk of a crisis happening will be detected sooner .",
    "moreover , when the market is becoming unstable , one typically witnesses an increase in the correlations between commodity and energy securities ( typically large oil companies stocks included in the indices ) .",
    "since we included some investable commodity futures ( like oil futures ) in dataset 2 , we expect to capture that effect which is indicative of the appearance inside the financial market of the right conditions for a crisis to happen .",
    "* the third dataset ( dataset 3 ) contains twelve assets which are the sp500 index and its ten sector sub - indices ( consumer discretionary , consumer staples , energy , financials , health care , industrials , information technology , materials , telecommunication services , utilities ) plus a small capitalization index , the russel 2000 .",
    "this dataset should provide information about the inner workings of the sp500 and enable us to detect `` american '' crises ( for example the sub - prime crisis of 2007 ) sooner and with a higher precision than dataset 1 or dataset 2 which are global by design and include information about the contagion between the three largest financial markets ( asia , europe , north america ) .",
    "however , since the north american market still leads the world of finance , it is to be expected that the actual crises anticipated by the use of either three of dataset 1 , dataset 2 or dataset 3 will be roughly the same .",
    "the inclusion in the mix of a small capitalization index is to try to take advantage of the fact that in the times leading up to a financial crisis , the small caps tend to overheat and form speculative bubbles while they become more and more correlated between themselves and stocks with larger market capitalization .",
    "dataset 3 spans from september 13th 1989 to december 27th 2013 . *",
    "the fourth dataset ( dataset 4 ) is the european counterpart of dataset 3 .",
    "it contains eleven assets : the bloomberg european 500 index ( be500 ) and its ten sector sub - indices , which are the same as for the sp500 ( consumer discretionary , consumer staples , energy , financials , health care , industrials , information technology , materials , telecommunication services , utilities ) . as we did not find any european - wide equivalent to the russel 2000",
    ", it does not include small caps however .",
    "it should enable us to better and sooner detect `` european '' crises like the e.u sovereign debt crisis of 2010 while still containing enough information to detect all the other global financial crises .",
    "it spans from january 1st 1987 to december 27th 2013 .",
    "* the fifth dataset ( dataset 5 ) is designed with the financial concept of _ flight to quality _ in mind . indeed , in the times preceding a financial crisis ,",
    "the anxiety of market agents is building up and they tend to abandon equity positions in favor of safer investment grade treasury or corporate bonds . in that regard ,",
    "the usual observed phenomenon is a positive correlation between equity and bonds in a bull market and a negative correlation between equity and bonds in a bear market .",
    "when the correlation between equity and bonds is becoming too high , this may be a sign that the bull market is about to burn itself out , that a bubble is about to burst , heralding the start of a financial crisis .",
    "dataset 5 is built with the detection of that phenomenon in mind .",
    "it contains all of the data of dataset 3 ( sp500 index , its 10 sector indices and the russel 2000 as a small capitalization index ) plus a number of funds based on investment grade sovereign or corporate bonds .",
    "much like dataset 3 , dataset 5 is u.s market oriented and is therefore more suited to anticipate crises that originate from or directly affect the north american market . for the long government bonds we have : wasatch - hoisington u.s .",
    "treasury fund ( whosx ) and thornburg limited term u.s .",
    "government fund class a ( ltucx ) .",
    "for the corporate bonds we have selected lord abbett bond debenture fund class a ( lbndx ) and vanguard long - term investment - grade fund investor shares ( vwesx ) which have both enough aum ( assets under management ) to be systemically significant and have existed for a long enough time to be historically relevant .",
    "dataset 5 contains therefore 16 assets and spans from september 13th 1989 to december 27th 2013 .",
    "* the sixth dataset ( dataset 6 ) is constituted of 226 individual components of the sp500 index . because of the evolution over time in the composition of the index , a balance had to be found between keeping a sufficient number of components and having enough historical data .",
    "it spans from january 17th 1990 to may 15th 2015 .",
    "the apple inc ( aapl ) stock was chosen as the reference with regard to filtering out non - trading days and whenever another element of data was unavailable ( on rare seemingly random days it appears that some individual stocks were not traded or the data was unavailable ) we carried over the last previously available value .",
    "we assumed that this manipulation would not compromise the overall quality of the data . besides those considerations , a few stocks like for example range resources corporation ( rrc un ) and the charles schwab corporation ( shcw un ) presented significant data gaps and were removed from the dataset . since building a dataset with exactly 500 components of the sp500 , taking in account the evolution in the composition of the index over time , proved an impossible task due to its complexity and the availability of the data ( mergers , corporate spin - offs and private equity acquisitions would have had to be taken into considerations as well )",
    ", we are aware of the fact that dataset 6 , especially when used in conjunction with financial crises indicators might suffer from survivorship bias . as a matter of fact , especially in the times leading up to a crisis",
    ", the failing companies drop below the capitalization threshold or are acquired by others while new healthier firms enter the index .",
    "we built dataset 6 because , as we are going to see in the empirical section , working with whole indices and/or limited number of individual securities like in all the previous datasets we created ( especially dataset 3 which resembles a scaled down version of dataset 6 ) , tends to have an averaging effect on the correlations and renders the correlation signal too noisy and blurred to be useful as a crisis detection method .",
    "for reference , the bloomberg tickers of all the stocks inside dataset 6 are provided in appendix .",
    "besides the daily close price , from which we derive the log - returns , that is contained in all the other datasets ,",
    "dataset 6 also includes daily volumes and market capitalization .",
    "those extra variables will enable us later to add appropriate weights to the individual stocks in order to refine the computation of the indicators . * the seventh dataset ( dataset 7 ) is constituted of the sp500 , the russel 2000 index and ten indices from emerging markets : buenos aires stock exchange merval index ( merval , argentina ) , ibovespa brasil sao paulo stock exchange index ( ibov , brasil ) , mexican stock exchange index ( mexbol , mexico ) , moscow exchange composite index ( micex , russia ) , hong kong hang seng index ( hsi , hong kong / china ) , shanghai stock exchange composite index ( shcomp , china ) , jakarta stock exchange composite index ( jci , indonesia ) , national stock exchange cnx nifty index ( nifty , india ) , ftse / jse africa all share index ( jalsh , south africa ) , borsa",
    "istanbul 100 index ( xu100 , turkey ) .",
    "it spans from september 22nd 1997 to may 12th 2015 .",
    "the relatively shallow depth of this dataset , which in particular may render the study of the asian crisis of the late 1990 more difficult , is due to gaps in data availability , especially for the russian index that we decided to keep anyway due to its importance for the global commodity and energy markets .",
    "all those emerging indices were expressed in the local currency on bloomberg and were therefore converted into u.s dollars .",
    "this conversion was very important when dealing with emerging economies where the exchange rate of the local currency against the u.s dollar can fluctuate wildly and violently especially in the times leading up to , and during a financial crisis . unlike in advanced economies ( we did not convert the european and japanese indices into u.s dollars in dataset 1 for example ) , the position of the currency of an emerging country against the u.s dollar is also highly correlated to the health of the local real economy .",
    "this idea was developed by hawkins and klau ( 2000 ) when they were working with the bank of international settlements : in emerging markets , financial crises are often preceded by overvalued exchange rates and inadequate international monetary reserves .    regarding the selection of the financial crisis events on a global scale ( for use mainly with dataset 1 and dataset 2 ) or at least a regional scale ( for use mainly with dataset 3 , dataset 4 , dataset 5 , dataset 6 and dataset 7 ) of the last 30 years , we compiled table 1 below , which has no ambition of being exhaustive .",
    "succinct historical context will be discussed in the empirical results section when needed . while categorizing the various kinds of financial crises",
    "goes far beyond the scope of this paper , we strove to consider a wide selection in the kinds of crises .",
    "there are stock market crashes like black monday in 1987 and the nasdaq crash in 2000 .",
    "there are financial crises that are rooted into a deep structural fragility of some parts of the real economy , like the real estate sector in the case of the japanese asset price bubble of the early 1990 and the sub - prime crisis that started in america during the summer of 2007 or the automobile industry in the case of the bankruptcy of general motors in june 2009 , four years after delphi corporation , which was general motors main supplier of automotive parts .",
    "there are financial crises for which the main trigger was a sovereign debt default like the russian crisis in 1998 , the argentine crisis in 2001 or the eurozone crisis , triggered by the greek haircut in 2010 .",
    "there are monetary crises as well , like black wednesday in 1992 when the british government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) or the mexican crisis triggered by the devaluation of the peso against the u.s dollar .",
    "since none of the datasets include foreign exchange data , we do not expect that any of the indicators will perform well when it comes to anticipating monetary crises , however .",
    "there are banking crises as well such as the s&l crisis in america that spanned from the mid-1980 to the mid-1990 and during which almost one third of all american savings and loans associations ( financial institutions that are allowed to accept savings deposits and to make loans ) failed , including hundreds of banks of all sizes and systemic significance .",
    "the dates chosen may sometimes seem a little arbitrary but choices had to be made , especially for crises that , unlike black monday that played out mostly within a few days of extreme market distress , took place over many months or even years of sustained drop like the nasdaq in early 2000 , which took nearly four months to lose almost two fifth of its march 10th peak .",
    "most financial crises do not happen in one day and instead result from a long process of instability buildup inside the market , the kind of which the indicators that we have built are detecting .",
    "when a crisis is best described by a clear explosion , then the date of that event was chosen ( black monday , the day lehman brothers failed , etc ... ) .",
    "when a date for a crisis spanning months or years had to be chosen for this study , we considered either the date of the most marking event ( the day the nasdaq peaked , the day general motors filled for chapter 11 bankruptcy , the day the greek haircut was announced , etc ... ) or a date roughly situated in the middle of the crisis process like january 1st 1990 for the s&l crisis . +    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( table 3 : crisis prediction )    the forecast period is constituted of 3770 trading days . for a mdd threshold of 10%",
    "there are 1281 crisis events in the forecast period and indicator b3b predicts 1201 of them while missing 80 and giving 1083 false positives . when the mdd threshold is put at 25% ,",
    "there are only 268 crisis events in the forecast period and indicator b3b predicts all of them while giving 2016 false positives . the fact that indicator b3b does not miss any crisis event characterized by the larger mdd threshold ( @xmath1 ) is reassuring from a financial stability point of view : an investor using a trading strategy based on the indicator that we have built would not have been caught off guard by a serious market downturn .",
    "of course there are a lot of false positives , especially for the larger crises and there is room for improvement but , as we said in the introduction , the information that there is only a 10% chance of a serious market event to happen within the next 100 days has tremendous value for market agents .",
    "false negatives can spell disaster while false positives might merely reduce profit and in that sense indicator b3b is already very useful for a traditional risk averse investor or a regulator .",
    "however , if profit maximization is the most important benchmark for a less risk averse investor , then we could say that indicator b3b performs best for the medium intensity crises ( 15 % to 20 % mdd threshold ) because it is there that the proportion of false positives remains smaller while the risk of a false negative is still acceptable .",
    "as a general conclusion , we could start by saying that the nine financial crisis indicators that we have built are all generally able to detect most of the financial crises that we have studied . in both the historical approach , where we made use of chosen dates for the crisis events , and the algorithmic trading approach , where we used a more quantitative definition of the financial crises based on the mdd , the indicators were indeed capable of confirming the occurrence of market turmoil .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated an out of sample predictive power for several of those indicators , while using a dataset constituted of selected components of the sp500 index .",
    "+ we recall that we have built two sets of financial crisis indicators that we then applied on seven datasets .",
    "the financial crisis indicators that we have built are all based of the study of the spectrum of a covariance matrix , a correlation matrix or a weighted correlation matrix .",
    "they measure the volatility and correlations between a number of assets in order to evaluate whether the conditions are right for adverse random events , which are happening all the time , to trigger financial crises .",
    "+ the first kind of indicators , that we called the a - series , comprises three indicators .",
    "indicator a1 and a2 are at each date the hellinger distance between the empirical distribution of the spectrum of the covariance matrix and two different calm market reference distributions .",
    "indicator a3 for its part is at each date the hellinger distance between the empirical distribution of the spectrum of the covariance matrix and a reference distribution characterizing a market in turmoil .",
    "we found that one of the most useful patterns for financial crisis detection and forecast in the profiles of the indicators of the a - series is characterized by a spike in a1 and a2 accompanied by a drop in a3 .",
    "indeed , when this pattern occurs , it means that the market is in the process of moving away from a calm state and toward more turbulence .",
    "+ we called the indicators of the second type the b - series .",
    "indicator b1 is the spectral radius of the covariance matrix and bases its forecasts on a mixed signal of volatility and correlation .",
    "indicator b2 is the trace of the covariance matrix and relies on volatility only to make its predictions .",
    "indicator b3 is the spectral radius of the correlation matrix and relies on correlation only to make its predictions .",
    "we also have built three additional versions of b3 .",
    "b3a is the spectral radius of a correlation matrix where the assets have been weighted with regards to the market capitalization of the firms they represent .",
    "b3b is the spectral radius of a correlation matrix where the assets have been weighted with regards to their daily traded volume and b3c is an averaged version of b3b .",
    "we found that the indicators of the b - series , especially those that rely , in part or in whole , on correlation performed better while using the components of an index rather than a basket of indices . that probably has to do with the averaging effect that is a very strong influence in the computation of an index .",
    "used on dataset 6 , which contains the components of the sp500 , indicator b3b is the one which gave us the best and most reproducible results .",
    "+ in the last part of the study , we demonstrated that indicators b3b and b3c do possess , after proper calibration , a real out of sample power of prediction in estimating the probability of a financial crisis happening at a given time horizon in the future .",
    "while the approach that we adopted gave many false positives ( a red flag is returned and no crisis happens in the market ) as well , the low number of false negatives reinforced our conviction about the viability and usefulness of the financial crisis indicators that we have built .",
    "for indicator b3b , we also developed a quantitative approach relying on defining a financial crisis in terms of the crossing of an mdd threshold .",
    "+ we are confident that the framework we propose and the financial crisis indicators that we have built are able to bring new insight on the topic of financial crisis detection and prediction . in the future , one of the possible ways of applying these methods would be to use them to build systematic trading strategies .",

    "<S> the aim of this work is to build financial crisis indicators based on time series of market data . after choosing an optimal size for a rolling window , </S>",
    "<S> the historical market data in this window is seen every trading day as a random matrix from which a covariance and a correlation matrix are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the indicators that we have built deal with the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the simple intuitive idea that we rely upon is that correlation and volatility are like the heartbeat of the financial market : when correlations between asset prices increase or develop abnormal patterns , when volatility starts to increase , then a crisis event might be around the corner . the financial crisis indicators that we have built are of two kinds . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is based on the hellinger distance , computed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference covariance matrix . as reference distributions we use the theoretical marchenko pastur distribution and </S>",
    "<S> numerically computed ones using a random matrix of the same size as the empirical rolling matrix and constituted of gaussian or student - t coefficients with some simulated correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of the spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the sense of hellinger , then a crisis may be forthcoming . </S>",
    "<S> the second type of indicators is based on the study of the spectral radius and the trace of the covariance and correlation matrices as a mean to directly study the volatility and correlations inside the market . </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind the second type of indicators is the fact that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic instability .    </S>",
