    "the standard view @xcite , @xcite of the primary textbook example of a scalar field theory with quartic self - coupling in four space - time dimensions is that it is a trivial theory .",
    "this means that a true continuum limit of the regularized theory inevitably leads to a non - interacting gaussian theory .",
    "more precisely , the perturbative renormalization group predicts that , once one is close to this limit , the renormalized coupling asymptotically vanishes logarithmically with the cutoff .",
    "this weak dependence keeps @xmath2 theory useful as a physical theory , because we can simultaneously have only small cutoff effects but still have sizeable interaction in an effective theory valid over a limited but large range of length scales . in the absence of rigorous proofs of triviality in four dimensions , it remains to follow the strategy of @xcite and to verify in a nonperturbative lattice calculation that the perturbative scenario actually applies close to the continuum limit , and thus to exclude the logical possibility that it is simply irrelevant .",
    "we re - address this old subject because numerical progress @xcite has made it possible to render such tests more stringent with only moderate resources .",
    "although the situation is complicated by the coupling to other fields , triviality is also the standard scenario for the higgs field in the standard model .",
    "the subtle nature of logarithmic effects makes a numerical check of the triviality picture rather non - trivial in spite of the simple field structure of @xmath2 theory .",
    "a number of monte carlo simulations have been conducted of which @xcite is one example where the then new cluster algorithm was used in the symmetric phase .",
    "these as well as our new simulations took place in the ising limit of @xmath2 theory , which amounts to infinitely strong bare coupling , where we expect to find the strongest possible interaction .    in @xcite a novel approach to simulate this model was presented which is based on the simulation of aizenman s random current representation @xcite .",
    "its numerical efficiency is closely related to the fact that this equivalent reformulation enabled aizenman to derive bounds that prove triviality in @xmath8 dimensions . for both applications",
    "it is essential that the connected four point correlation that enters into the renormalized coupling , can be calculated _ without _ the need of performing cancellations and with the lebowitz inequality @xcite being manifest .",
    "the elimination of the otherwise unavoidable loss of significance in the monte carlo allows to rather easily compute the renormalized coupling with per mille precision close to the continuum limit .",
    "an additional decisive bonus is the practically complete absence of critical slowing down .",
    "the triviality conjecture in @xmath9 is investigated here in a finite volume renormalization scheme where the continuum limit is approached on a volume that remains finite in units of the physical renormalized length scale .",
    "this has the same advantage here as in asymptotically free theories @xcite , @xcite , namely that the mastering of a large ratio of physical scales is avoided and one can thus probe the universal continuum limit much more closely .    in this paper we employ the numerical technique described in @xcite without changes and therefore here leave out all details on this .",
    "the data with @xmath5 , already published in @xcite , are extended by including a lattice of size @xmath10 and by simulating two more series of lattices at @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition we report on a computation in lattice perturbation theory that we employ to analyze the data .",
    "this calculation goes beyond @xcite by allowing for finite @xmath7 values and by computing the lattice artifacts of the callan symanzik @xmath12-function up to two loops . by combining with @xcite",
    "we also obtain the three loop term for various finite @xmath7 . by comparing with our data we will conclude that perturbation theory works well for large @xmath7 and fails for small @xmath7 .",
    "a plausible reason for the failure of perturbation theory on a small torus is that the constant zero momentum mode may receive too little gaussian damping to justify its perturbative treatment @xcite .",
    "we therefore embark on an alternative approximation scheme where we treat this one mode exactly while maintaining the perturbative expansion for all others .",
    "it turns out that this type of expansion rearranges itself under renormalization to an expansion in powers of @xmath13 for arbitrary values of @xmath14 .",

    "renormalized perturbation theory is expected to describe the universal physics in spite of the apparent contradiction as long as successive terms in the @xmath0 expansion ( at small @xmath111 ) look reasonably ` convergent ' .",

    "we may simultaneously consider a lattice that is coarser but still in the scaling region tuned to the same ( matched ) renormalized parameters . on this lattice",
    "the bare @xmath109 will be smaller and the expansion may also be _ naively _ justified .",
    "up to differing small scaling violations the universal physics will then agree on both lattices .",
    "one could consider the extension of this matching to the leading cutoff effects in the spirit of the symanzik effective action .",
    "but then one would need further improvement terms on the coarser lattice to reproduce the cutoff effects of the finer one . as an alternative qualitative",
    "argument we could imagine a block - spin coarsening of the original lattice . then we would expect to arrive at an effective action on the coarse lattice consisting of the relevant terms of ( [ sft ] ) with small @xmath109 and additional contributions corresponding to symanzik terms .",
    "therefore the relation between cutoff effects computed in perturbation theory with the standard action ( [ sft ] ) as sketched above and those of the nonperturbative results may not be so straightforward in our opinion .",
    "in this section we introduce a modified perturbative expansion which will turn out to lead to a systematic expansion in the finite size scaling variable @xmath7 defined in ( [ zdef ] ) .    in our perturbative calculation the gaussian",
    "damping of the low momentum modes on the torus is controlled by @xmath112 with @xmath113 having small integer components . for small @xmath7 with @xmath114",
