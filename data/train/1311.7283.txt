    "although a  close connection between theoretical distributed computing and algebraic topology has by now been securely established , see e.g. , @xcite , many questions pertaining to arising simplicial structures have remained unanswered . in this introduction",
    "we make a  short excursion to the distributed context , before proceeding with a  purely topological study in the following sections .    in theoretical",
    "distributed computing one considers @xmath2 processes which are trying to solve a  task by executing a  distributed protocol . to specify the task ,",
    "one simply fixes the set of possible input configurations , and for each input one fixes the set of legal output configurations .",
    "a  distributed protocol is a  sequence of instructions , where the type of instructions , which we are allowed to use , depends on the choice of the communication model .",
    "since one considers the asynchronous model , there is no such thing as the unique execution of the distributed protocol ; instead , one has a  number of possible executions .",
    "one says that distributed protocol solves the given task , if it yields a  correct output for any input configuration and any possible execution .",
    "it has been realized , at least since  @xcite , that it is fruitful to summarize the totality of all possible executions as a  single simplicial complex .",
    "this complex is called the _ protocol complex _ and depends on the distributed protocol and on the chosen communication model . specifically , the protocol complex is a  pure simplicial complex , whose dimension is one less than the number of processes .",
    "the top - dimensional simplices of the protocol complex correspond to all possible executions of a  given protocol , and its vertices correspond to all possible views of processes at the end of an execution .    even though we focus on the shared - memory communication models , there are still many options to choose from , some are more natural than others . curiously , the protocol complexes corresponding to the most natural model , the one using write and snapshot read operations with no restrictions on their interweaving during executions , have not been studied much , since their simplicial structure is rather complicated .",
    "still , it was shown that these complexes are always contractible , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) , @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the topology of the protocol complexes of the layered immediate snapshot wait - free protocols is very easy .",
    "namely , one can show , that each such protocol complex is a  subdivision of a  simplex whose vertices are indexed by the processes , see  @xcite .",
    "a crucial construction in understanding the topology of these protocol complexes for @xmath3 processes is the so - called _ standard chromatic subdivision _",
    "@xmath1 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsections 3.6.3 , 8.4.1 , chapter 16 ) , @xcite .    in this paper , we study the analog of this construction , which is derived from the snapshot model .",
    "we call the corresponding simplicial complex the _ view complex _ , see definition  [ df : view ] for a  completely combinatorial description . from the point of view of distributed computing",
    ", the view complex is a very central object , since it is the protocol complex for the snapshot protocol in which each process executes exactly one round .",
    "however , for us this is just a motivation , and we study the family of simplicial complexes @xmath4 from a purely topological point of view .    as already the lower - dimensional examples show , starting with @xmath5 the simplicial complex @xmath0 does not have to be a  subdivision of a  simplex . as a  matter of fact , it is not a  manifold , not even a  pseudomanifold , since its simplices of codimension @xmath6 may belong to more than two top - dimensional simplices .",
    "yet , we show that it is possible to understand the topology of the complex @xmath0 rather completely .    to start with",
    ", it is easy to see directly that the simplicial complex @xmath0 contains @xmath1 as a  subcomplex .",
    "this makes sense in the distributed computing context since every immediate snapshot execution is also an execution in the snapshot model .",
    "our main theorem , theorem  [ thm : main ] , states that @xmath0 can be collapsed to @xmath1 , and that @xmath1 is itself collapsible .",
    "this yields a  constructive and purely combinatorial proof of contractibility of @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is stronger than the mere contractibility , being rather a  statement about the involved simplicial structures .",
    "we remark , that also the fact that the standard chromatic subdvision @xmath1 is collapsible is new .    the simplicial complexes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equipped with a  canonical simplicial action of the permutation group @xmath7}$ ] .",
    "this is the reflection of the fact that the considered protocols are symmetric with respect to the renaming of processors .",
    "the statement which we actually prove in theorem  [ thm : main ] is stronger than just collapsibility .",
    "we show that our collapses can be done in an @xmath7}$]-equivariant way , meaning that entire @xmath7}$]-orbits of collapses can be performed simultaneously , see section  [ sect : coll ] , and specifically definition  [ df : gcoll ] , for the precise meaning of @xmath7}$]-collapses .",
    "we recall , that in the theoretical distributed computing it is well - known that the snapshot and the immediate snapshot models are computationally equivalent , see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "this implies @xmath204 , and so @xmath205 .",
    "this shows that @xmath206 .",
    "the other direction follows from the fact that the intervals are disjoint , together with the induction hypothesis .",
    "namely , we have @xmath207 , which implies @xmath208 , and hence @xmath209 . summarizing , we conclude that holds for this  @xmath175 .",
    "the equality means that for every @xmath186 , the simplex @xmath210 is free in @xmath211 , and that the corresponding collapse results in @xmath182 . proposition  [ prop : phi](3 ) says that @xmath121 , in particular @xmath212 , for @xmath33 , so the condition of definition  [ df : coll ] is satisfied .",

    "all we needed was the implication that if @xmath202 , then @xmath214 , so any linear extension of the set @xmath215 , equipped with the reverse inclusion order , would do .",
    "on the other hand , note that proposition  [ prop : phi](5 ) implies that for all @xmath49 either @xmath216 , or @xmath108 and @xmath217 are disjoint .",
    "since @xmath1 is a  simplicial subcomplex of @xmath0 , its face poset is a  lower ideal of @xmath164 . in particular , the linear extension of the set @xmath215 can be chosen in a  special way : first take any linear extension of the subset @xmath218 , and then concatenate it with any linear extension of @xmath219 .",
    "by what was said above , this concatenation is a  linear extension by itself .",
    "this linear extension now yields a  collapsing sequence from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and then from @xmath1 to the void complex .",
    "to finish the proof of our theorem , we need to modufy the collapsing sequence once more , in order to incorporate the @xmath7}$]-action .",

    "specifically , this means that the views @xmath223 are all distinct , and for each @xmath126}$ ] there exists @xmath224 , @xmath225 , such that @xmath226 . by proposition  [ prop : phi](6 ) , we know that the intervals @xmath227 are disjoint , and for each @xmath126}$ ] there exists @xmath224 , @xmath225 , such that @xmath228 . in other words , @xmath227 is a  set of representatives of the orbit @xmath7}(i(w_1))$ ] .",
