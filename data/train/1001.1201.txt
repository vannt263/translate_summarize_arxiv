    "it is possible to cut graphene sheet@xcite in the desired shape and size@xcite , and use it to make quantum dot devices . in such devices it may be possible to realize experimentally zigzag or armchair boundaries .",
    "graphene systems possess several unusual physical properties associated with the presence of the dirac points .",
    "for example , compared to ordinary landau levels of quasi - two - dimensional semiconductors the lowest landau level ( lll ) of graphene is peculiar since it has _ zero _ energy that is independent of magnetic field@xcite .",
    "moreover , wavefunctions of the lll are _ chiral _ , i.e. , the probability amplitude of find the electron on one type carbon atoms is zero .",
    "there are other graphene systems with zero energy states .",
    "semi - infinite@xcite or nanoribbon graphene@xcite with zigzag edges along the x - axis develop a flat band of _ zero _ energy chiral states .",
    "these states are surface states and are localized states at the zigzag edges with various localization lengths@xcite .",
    "the zigzag edge and the lll states have zero energy because their wavefunctions are chiral .",
    "effects of a magnetic field on graphene hall bars have been investigated recently , and some zero energy chiral states are found to be strongly localized on the zigzag edges in addition to the usual lll states@xcite .",
    "one may expect that the degeneracy of chiral states with zero energy will be split when quantum confinement effect is introduced in a graphene dot@xcite .",
    "however , the splitting of these energies may be unusual in some graphene dots@xcite .",
    "recently the magnetic field dependence of these levels in a gated graphene dot was investigated experimentally@xcite .",
    "effects of various types of edges have been also investigated : zigzag - edged dots , armchair - edged dots@xcite , and rectangular graphene dots with two zigzag and two armchair edges@xcite have been studied .",
    "armchair edges couple states near k and k@xmath0 points of the first brillouin zone and generate several mixed chiral zigzag edge states with _ nearly _ zero energies . in the rectangular dots the number of these states , @xmath1 ,",
    "may be determined from the condition that the x - component of wavevectors satisfies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the length of the unit cell , and @xmath5 ( the nearest neighbor carbon - carbon distance is @xmath6 , the horizontal length of the dot is @xmath7 with @xmath8 number of hexagons along the x - axis , and the vertical length is @xmath9 with @xmath10 the number of hexagons and @xmath11 carbon bonds along the y - axis .",

    "our investigation shows that the wavefunctions of nearly zero energy states are all peaked on the zigzag edges with or without appreciable weight inside the dot .",
    "this may be understood as mixing of lll and surface states by armchair edges of the square dot through intervalley scattering , which is unique to the square dot ( this will be explained in sec.iv ) .",

    "our numerical result is indeed consistent with this expectation , see fig.[fig : wavefunction1027zero ] ( d ) . as the ratio @xmath95 takes smaller values the nature of these states",
    "become more like that of lll states ( see fig.[fig : edge2 ] ) .",

    "some of these states are magnetic field independent surface states while the other states are field dependent .",
    "we find numerically that the wavefunctions of these states are all peaked near the zigzag edges with or without significant weight inside the dot .",
    "the physical origin of the presence of a significant weight is the coupling between k and k valleys due to the armchair edges .",
    "this effect is expected to survive small deviations from perfect armchair edges as long as they provide coupling between different valleys .",
