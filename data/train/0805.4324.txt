    "the energy transport immediately below the solar surface is mainly determined by convective processes that are visible as granulation patterns in white - light images of the quiet photosphere .",
    "this convection is suppressed inside sunspot umbrae due to the strong vertical magnetic field , but some form of magnetoconvection @xcite is needed to explain the observed umbral brightnesses .",
    "umbral fine structure such as light bridges or umbral dots , dotlike bright features inside umbrae , may well be manifestations of magnetoconvection .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain uds , e.g. , columns of field - free hot gas in between a bundle of thin magnetic flux ropes @xcite , or spatially modulated oscillations in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations of three - dimensional radiative magnetoconvection @xcite reveal convective plumes that penetrate through the solar surface and look very much like uds .",
    "although recent broadband images may have spatially resolved uds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) , spectropolarimetry is needed to learn more about their physical nature .",
    "previous spectroscopic observations led to heterogeneous results .",
    "@xcite found that uds exhibit upflows of 3  km  s@xmath3 and a 50% weaker magnetic field compared to the nearby umbra , whereas @xcite and @xcite reported little field weakening .",
    "finally , @xcite observed a weakening of 500  g and upflows of a few 100  m  s@xmath3 .",
    "more details can be found in the reviews of umbral fine structure by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one reason for the difference in results has been the influence of scattered light and variable seeing , which affect the different analyzed data sets to varying degrees .",
    "it therefore seems worthwhile to invert stokes profiles obtained by the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) on the @xmath0 spacecraft .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath0 data for the study of uds was demonstrated by @xcite , who found that large uds show dark lanes whose existence had been predicted by @xcite .",
    "the data employed here were acquired by the spectropolarimeter @xcite of the solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard @xmath0 .",
    "they are composed of full stokes spectra in the fe  i line pair around 6302   and the nearby continuum of a sunspot of noaa ar  10933 recorded from 12:43 to 12:59  ut on 2007 january 5 using the 0.16@xmath4x164@xmath4 slit . at this time",
    "the sunspot was located at a heliocentric angle of 4@xmath5 , i.e. very close to disk center .",
    "the observations covered the spectral range from 6300.89 to 6303.26   , with a sampling of 21  m  pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the sp was operated in its normal map mode , i.e. both the sampling along the slit and the slit - scan sampling were 0.16@xmath4 , so that the spatial resolution should be close to the diffraction limit of @xmath6 .",
    "the integration time per slit position was 4.8  s which reduced the noise level to @xmath7 .",
    "the data were corrected for dark current , flat field , and instrumental polarization with the help of the solarsoft package . a continuum intensity image ( put together from the slit scan ) of the chosen umbra",
    "is shown in figure  [ figumbra ] . due to the large slit length we are always able to find a sufficiently extensive region of quiet sun that is used to normalize intensities .",
    "sot / sp on 2007 january 5 .",
    "heliocentric angle is @xmath8  =  4@xmath5 .",
    "intensities are normalized to the intensity level of the quiet photosphere @xmath9 . the white line at ( 4,4 )  mm marks the cut through an umbral dot ( ud ) that is discussed in greater detail .",
    "to obtain atmospheric stratifications of temperature ( @xmath10 ) , magnetic field strength ( @xmath11 ) , and line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath12 ) we use the inversion code spinor described by @xcite .",
    "this code incorporates the stopro routines @xcite , which compute synthetic stokes profiles of one or more lines upon input of their atomic data and one or more model atmospheres .",
    "local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are assumed and the unno - rachkovsky radiative transfer equations are solved .",
    "the inversions use an optical depth scale as the appropriate coordinate for radiative transfer problems . for reasons of comparability we use the optical depth at 500  nm ( @xmath13 ) . starting with an initial guess model ,",
    "the synthetic profiles were iteratively fitted to observed data using response functions ( rfs ) and the merit function @xmath14 @xcite is minimized . with the help of the rfs",
    "we find that the fe  i line pair at 6302   is mainly formed within the @xmath15 interval [ @xmath16 , which corresponds to a height range of about 400  km under hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in the umbra .",
    "the free parameters are defined at the four nodes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 of the @xmath15 grid .",
    "the atmospheric stratification is then interpolated using splines onto a 10 times finer @xmath15 grid .",
    "the first step of our analysis is the wavelength calibration required to determine line - of - sight ( los ) velocities . for every slit position we average the stokes @xmath21 profiles of all locations along the slit whose total polarization @xmath22 is negligible , since",
    "those locations are assumed to represent the quiet sun .",
    "this mean @xmath21 profile is used to fit voigt profiles to the two fe  i lines from which the line center wavelengths are determined .",
    "the convective blueshift of 140  m  s@xmath3 ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is then removed .",
    "the next step is to find an appropriate model atmosphere .",
    "since we are interested in the atmospheric stratification of temperature , magnetic field strength , and los velocity within a ud , these three atmospheric parameters are assumed to be height dependent , whereas field inclination and azimuth angle , micro - turbulence , and macro - turbulence are assumed to be height independent .",
    "we experimented intensively with adding a second model component to represent the stray light , but the inversion results did not improve significantly , confirming the almost negligible stray light in the sp .",
    "therefore , in the interests of a robust inversion , we forbore from adding a stray light component , thus reducing the number of free parameters .",
    "lastly , we have to find initial guesses for all free parameters .",
    "we use an initial temperature stratification according to the umbral core model l of @xcite and assume a vertical magnetic field of 2000  g and zero los velocity at all heights .",
    "initial guesses for micro - turbulence and macro - turbulence are 0.1 and 2  km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "other initial guesses gave very similar results , except for a limited number of outliers .",
    "for these , repeating the inversion with an initial guess close to the final result of one of the neighboring pixels returned values consistent with those obtained for the other pixels .",
    "we analyzed a total of 51 uds , which were identified by applying the multilevel tracking ( mlt ) algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation )",
    ". for each ud the location of its core was identified , a cut was made through it , reaching to the neighboring diffuse background ( db ) , and the profiles from all the pixels along this cut were inverted .",
    "we first discuss the results for the ud marked in figure  [ figumbra ] , chosen because of its brightness , which leads to particularly small error bars .",
    "a comparison of the measured profiles with the best - fit profiles resulted from the inversion can be seen in figure  [ figprofileudbright ] for the ud and in figure  [ figprofileuddark ] for the db selected as the location of lowest continuum intensity in a 1.4  @xmath23  1.4  mm@xmath24 environment of the ud center . due to the low signal in the dark background",
    "the measured db profiles are much noisier than the ud center s profiles , but in general , the stokes spectra can be fitted remarkably well .    , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 profiles from the center of the ud marked in figure  [ figumbra ] .",
    "red lines are the measured , blue lines the best - fit profiles , i.e. the inversion result .",

    "the stratification of the retrieved atmospheric parameters @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 in the center of the ud and in the db are plotted in figure  [ figsingleatm ] . in the upper photosphere ( @xmath28 ) the error bars overlap ;",
    "i.e. we find little significant difference between ud and db . in the deeper photosphere , however , the inversions return strongly different stratifications .",
    "thus , the ud temperature is higher than the db temperature , consistent with the intensity enhancement of the ud in the continuum map .",
    "the los velocity ( which is identical to the vertical velocity due to the small heliocentric angle ) exhibits strong upflows in the ud center , whereas the db is nearly at rest .",
    "the magnetic field strength is roughly 2  kg for the heights @xmath29 .",
    "below @xmath30 the field strength of the ud decreases strongly with depth , whereas the field strength of the db increases moderately .",
    "the vertical cuts of magnetic field strength and los velocity through 13 pixels lying along the white line in figure  [ figumbra ] are shown in figure  [ figverticalcut ] .",
    "jumps from one pixel to the next were smoothed through interpolation .",
    "there is clear evidence for a localized decrease in ud field strength in the low photosphere , co - located with an upflow that extends higher into the atmosphere and a weak downflow on at least one side .",
    "the magnetic fields are 4@xmath5 more inclined in the ud than they are in the db around the ud .",
    "figure  [ figverticalcut ] looks remarkably like fig .  2 of @xcite , in spite of the fact that figure  [ figverticalcut ] is plotted on an optical depth scale in the vertical direction and is thus distorted by an unknown amount relative to a corresponding figure on a geometrical scale .     in the direction indicated by the white line .",
    "colors of the top panel indicate magnetic field strength .",
    "the bottom panel shows los velocity .",
    "negative velocities are upflows.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   in the direction indicated by the white line",
    ". colors of the top panel indicate magnetic field strength .",
    "the bottom panel shows los velocity .",
    "negative velocities are upflows.,title=\"fig : \" ]    next we discuss all 51 analyzed uds . in the literature",
    "we often find a separation into two ud regimes .",
    "for example , @xcite differentiate between peripheral uds ( puds ) and central uds ( cuds ) , i.e. between uds that are born close to the umbra - penumbra boundary and uds that are born deep in the umbra .",
    "we follow this distinction and plot the obtained stratifications of the 30 puds ( distance to umbra - penumbra boundary less than 2000  km ) in the top panels of figure  [ figmultipleatms ] , while the remaining 21 cuds are represented in the bottom panels of figure  [ figmultipleatms ] .",
    "the results largely mirror those obtained for the ud discussed above . in the upper atmosphere uds center and db",
    "do not differ in their mean values of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 .",
    "on average , the cuds are about 150  k cooler than the puds in the upper atmosphere , just as the db around the cuds is cooler than the db around the puds . at @xmath2",
    "we find that puds are 570  k hotter than the local db and cuds are 550  k hotter than the db in their vicinity .",
    "the magnetic field strength at @xmath2 is weakened by about 510  g for puds and 480  g for cuds , whereas only puds exhibit significant upflows of about 800 m  s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean los velocity shows no difference between cud centers and db . in order to make sure that an upflow is not being missed due to the lower s / n ratio of the cud stokes profiles , we have also averaged the stokes profiles of all the cuds .",
    "an inversion of there averaged stokes profiles gave a result that agrees with the averaged stratifications ( @xmath31 ) in the bottom panels of figure  [ figmultipleatms ] within the error bars .",
    "this suggests that any upflow velocity in cuds is mostly restricted to layers below the surface or is too concentrated or too weak to be detected by the inversions .",
    "finally , we find that the magnetic field of the puds is on average 4@xmath5 more horizontal than for their db .",
    "we see no inclination difference for cuds .",
    "we identified 30 peripheral and 21 central umbral dots in @xmath0 spectropolarimetric data of a sunspot within 4@xmath5 of disk center . with the help of stokes profile inversions of the fe  i lines at 630",
    "nm we determined the stratifications of temperature , magnetic field strength , and los velocity .",
    "the present work differs from that of @xcite in the superior quality of the employed data with twice the spatial resolution and practically no scattered light .",
    "this allows a detailed determination of the atmospheric stratification .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of the @xmath0 sp data also allows us to , for the first time , reconstruct both the horizontal and the vertical structure of uds .",
    "we also extended the analysis to a more numerous statistical ensemble of 51 uds .",
    "vertical cuts through uds provide a remarkable confirmation of the results of mhd simulations of @xcite : both show that uds differ from their surroundings mainly in the lowest visible layers , where the temperature is enhanced and the magnetic field is weakened .",
    "we found a temperature enhancement of 550  k and a magnetic field reduction of about 500  g ( at optical depth unity ) .",
    "in addition , puds display upflow velocities of 800  m  s@xmath3 on average , again in good agreement with the simulations .",
    "there are also some differences between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "thus , according to our inversions the magnetic field strength of the db is somewhat depth dependent .",
    "this was not the case for the mhd simulations due to the used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , although some of the uds display a weak downflow bounding the strong central upflow ( see figure  [ figverticalcut ] ) , these are neither as narrow nor as strong as the downflows at the ends of dark lanes as reported by @xcite , probably due to the limited spatial resolution of our data .",
    "we may also be missing some of the narrow downflows by considering only single cuts across individual uds .",
    "@xcite reported 10@xmath5 more inclined magnetic fields in puds .",
    "this result is qualitatively confirmed by our work ; we find an inclination increase of 4@xmath5 for puds but no increase for cuds , which can be assumed as a further hint that the main part of the cud structure is below the surface .",
    "these results can be interpreted in terms of the strong db fields expanding with height and closing over the ud , as proposed by @xcite ."
