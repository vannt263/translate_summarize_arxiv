    "the chromosphere of the quiet sun is one of the most complex stellar atmospheric regions ( e.g. , harvey 2006 , 2009 ; judge 2006 , 2009 ) . lying between the thin photosphere and the extended @xmath5 k corona",
    ", it is here where the magnetic field becomes the globally dominating factor ruling the outer solar atmosphere .",
    "measuring the magnetic field vector in the solar chromospheric plasma is , however , notoriously difficult , especially outside sunspots and related active regions .",
    "quantitative information can be obtained through spectropolarimetry , but the measurement and physical interpretation of the weak polarization signatures that the hanle and zeeman effects produce in the few chromospheric lines that can be observed from ground - based telescopes is not an easy task ( see trujillo bueno 2010 , for a recent review ) .",
    "it is thus important to develop novel methods of  measuring \" the chromospheric magnetic field , ideally based on the action of the hanle and zeeman effects in spectral lines whose line - center intensity images reveal the fine - scale thermodynamic structuring of the solar chromosphere .",
    "here we show that the scattering polarization observed in the ir triplet of ca ii contains valuable information on the thermal and magnetic structure of the  quiet \" chromosphere , from the shock dominated region of the  lower chromosphere \" to the  upper chromosphere \" below the interface region to the @xmath5 k solar corona .",
    "the only way to obtain direct empirical information on the intensity and topology of the magnetic fields of the solar chromosphere is via the measurement and interpretation of polarization signals in chromospheric spectral lines . in regions with high concentrations of magnetic flux , such as in sunspots and plages ,",
    "the polarization patterns are dominated by the zeeman effect .",
    "hence , diagnostic techniques based on this effect are quite useful ( e.g. , socas - navarro , trujillo bueno & ruiz cobo 2000 ; socas - navarro 2005 ) . however , in the quiet sun , which covers most of the solar disk at any given time during the solar magnetic activity cycle , the zeeman splitting between the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) components ( @xmath10 being the magnetic quantum number ) is only a small fraction of the width of the spectral lines formed in the chromosphere . as a result , the transverse zeeman effect makes a very small or insignificant contribution to the emergent linear polarization amplitudes . on the other hand , the circular polarization of the zeeman effect as a diagnostic tool is of limited practical interest for the exploration of the magnetism of the upper chromosphere because the response function of the emergent stokes @xmath11 profiles of strong lines like h@xmath12 and ca ii 8542   is significant only in the photosphere and/or lower chromosphere ( socas - navarro & uitenbroek 2004 ; uitenbroek 2006 ) .",
    "there is yet another mechanism producing linear polarization in the spectral lines that can be exploited to diagnose the solar chromosphere .",
    "atoms align due to the optical pumping caused by the incident anisotropic radiation field ; i.e. , the individual magnetic @xmath10 sublevels of energy levels with total angular momentum @xmath13 are unevenly populated ( in such a way that the populations of substates with different values of @xmath14 are unequal ) and coherences between them may appear .",
    "this , in turn , gives rise to a sizable amount of linear polarization in chromospheric spectral lines , either by selective emission or absorption of polarization components in the spectral line .",
    "a remarkable example is provided by the ir triplet of ca ii .",
    "its linear polarization pattern was considered `` enigmatic '' for a while ( stenflo , keller & gandorfer 2000 ) because it was impossible to achieve even a qualitative fit to the observed relative polarization amplitudes considering that scattering line polarization results only from selective emission processes caused by the population imbalances of the line s upper level .",
    "it was later realized that selective absorption of polarization components caused by the presence of populations imbalances in the line s lower level is a very efficient mechanism for producing linear polarization in the spectral lines of a stellar atmosphere ( trujillo bueno & landi deglinnocenti 1997 ; trujillo bueno 1999 ; trujillo bueno et al .",
    "in fact , manso sainz & trujillo bueno ( 2003 ) demonstrated quantitatively that the physical origin of the linear polarization pattern observed in the ca ii lines at 8542 and 8662   is indeed  zero - field \" dichroism , i.e. , selective absorption of polarization components caused by the presence of atomic alignment in the metastable lower levels @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , while that observed in the 8498   line is controled by both dichroism and by the selective emission of polarization components that result from the population imbalances between the sublevels of its upper level @xmath17 .",
    "the alignment of the atomic @xmath18-levels and the ensuing emergent linear polarization is modified by the presence of a magnetic field through the hanle effect , even if the magnetic field turns out to have a complex , tangled topology , with mixed polarities at subresolution scales ( e.g. , landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) . in the absence of collisional depolarization the magnetic field strength @xmath19 ( in g ) that is sufficient to produce a significant change is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the lifetime ( in seconds ) and the land factor of the @xmath18 level under consideration .",
    "interestingly enough , since the lifetimes of the metastable lower levels of the ca ii ir triplet are about two orders of magnitude larger than the upper level lifetimes and levels with @xmath23 or @xmath24 can not carry atomic alignment , the linear polarization of the ca ii line at 8662   ( whose upper level has @xmath25 ) is expected to be sensitive to mg fields only , while the scattering polarization of the 8498   and 8542   lines ( which share the same upper level whose @xmath26 ) can in principle be sensitive also to magnetic fields in the gauss range . in the quiet solar chromosphere depolarization of the ca ii atomic levels by elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms",
    "is insignificant for the upper levels of the h and k lines , while such collisions have a rather small impact on the atomic polarization of the metastable lower levels ( manso sainz & trujillo bueno 2003 ; derouich , trujillo bueno & manso sainz 2007 ) . actually , the mere fact that the ca ii 8662   line shows a clear @xmath3 polarization signal ( see stenflo et al .",
    "2000 ) implies that its lower level ( whose @xmath27 ) is significantly polarized in the quiet solar chromosphere ( manso sainz & trujillo bueno 2003 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the thermal and magnetic sensitivity of the scattering polarization @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles of the ca ii ir triplet . after formulating in  2 the multilevel problem of scattering polarization and the hanle effect , ",
    "4 discusses the unmagnetized case in the  hot \" and  cool \" chromospheric models described in  3 .",
    "the impact of the hanle effect on the linear polarization profiles of the ca ii ir triplet is discussed in  5 , showing for each solar atmospheric model detailed results for the cases of disk center (  5.1 ) and close to the limb observations (  5.2 ) .",
    "the ensuing information is summarized in  5.3 in the form of hanle effect diagrams for each of the spectral lines of the ir triplet . finally , ",
    "6 summarizes our main conclusions with an outlook to future research .",
    "the relevant radiative transfer problem here implies calculating , at each spatial point of the ( generally magnetized ) astrophysical plasma model under consideration , the values of the diagonal and non - diagonal elements of the atomic density matrix corresponding to each atomic level of total angular momentum @xmath18 , which quantify its overall population , the population imbalances between its magnetic sublevels , and the quantum coherences between each pair of them .",
    "the values of such density - matrix elements have to be consistent with the intensity , polarization and symmetry properties of the radiation field generated within the medium .",
    "this requires solving jointly the rt equations for the stokes parameters and the statistical equilibrium equations for the density - matrix elements .",
    "once such a self - consistent solution is obtained it is straightforward to compute the emergent stokes profiles via the formal solution of the stokes - vector transfer equation for any desired line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to formulate such equations with emphasis on the case of the ir triplet of ca ii .",
    "the excitation state of the atomic system is described through the density matrix ( fano 1957 ) .",
    "we consider the populations ( @xmath28 ) , and coherences ( @xmath29 ) among the @xmath30 magnetic sublevels @xmath10 of each given atomic level with total angular momentum @xmath18 . alternatively",
    ", we use the multipolar components of the atomic density matrix ( omont 1977 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the expression in brackets is the wigner 3j - symbol ( e.g. , brink & satchler 1968 ) .",
    "the @xmath34 elements with @xmath35 are real numbers measuring population imbalances between sublevels , while @xmath36 is the total population of the level .",
    "the @xmath37 elements are combinations of the complex non - diagonal components @xmath29 .",
    "hermiticity of the density matrix ( @xmath38 ) implies @xmath39^*$ ] ( @xmath40 meaning complex conjugate ) . in the absence of net circular polarization in the incident radiation @xmath41 ,",
    "i.e. , atoms _ align _ but they do not _",
    "orientate_. hence , odd-@xmath42 @xmath43 elements vanish . therefore , the 5-level atomic model of ca  ii considered here ( fig .",
    "1 ) requires @xmath44 @xmath43 elements to fully characterize the excitation state of the atomic system .",
    "the transfer of spectral line polarization is described by the following equations for the stokes parameters    [ rte ] @xmath45 \\\\",

    "in particular , linearly polarized emission is due to the presence of alignment and coherences between atomic sublevels of the upper level of the transition .",

    "finally , the anomalous dispersion terms ( @xmath76 ) have the same functional dependence on the @xmath74 values of the _ lower _ level , but with an antisymmetric dispersive dependence on frequency , i.e. , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the dispersion profile .    additionally , we consider an unpolarized background continuum providing an extra absorption coefficient @xmath79 and emissivity @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is the planck function ) , a very good approximation toward the red part of the solar spectrum ( e.g. , gandorfer 2000 ) .",

    "this contribution is however negligible compared to the longitudinal zeeman effect signal produced by the splitting of the @xmath46-components of the emission profile which we do not consider here .",
    "since the degree of anisotropy of the radiation field in solar - like atmospheres is weak , the population imbalances and coherences of each @xmath18-level are only a small fraction of its overall population .",

    "we find that the ca ii 8542   and 8662   lines are mostly sensitive to fields between 0.001 and 0.1 g , the former being also weakly sensitive to fields between 1 and 10 g. otherwise the linear polarization signals are dependent only on the magnetic field geometry , but not to its intensity .",
    "the 8498   line is highly sensitive in the whole regime 0.00110 g , but its scattering polarization amplitude is significantly lower in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "probably , the most interesting line of the ca ii ir triplet because of its diagnostic potential is the strongest one : @xmath192 .",
    "its linear polarization is sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field in the chromosphere of the quiet sun , though not too much to its strength unless @xmath193 g there .",
    "although its scattering polarization amplitude depends on the thermal structure of the solar chromosphere , the emergent @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles do not change sign between the (  hot \" ) fal - c model and the (  cool \" ) m - co model , unlike @xmath194 , which is very sensitive to the physical conditions of the lower chromosphere .",
    "the thermal sensitivity of the @xmath195 line ( which is sensitive only to milligauss field strengths ) is similar to that of the 8542   line .",
    "therefore , spatial fluctuations in the sign of the emergent @xmath4 profiles of the ca ii 8542   and 8662   lines may be ascribed more safely to spatial variations in the azimuth of the chromospheric magnetic field than is the case for @xmath194 .    more generally , the emergent @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles are produced by the joint action of atomic level polarization , and the hanle and transverse zeeman effects . in this paper we have considered only the action of atomic level polarization and the hanle effect .",
    "these effects dominate the emergent linear polarization profiles for inclined magnetic fields with strengths weaker than @xmath196 , where the @xmath196 value depends on the scattering geometry .    in the forward scattering geometry of a disk center observation ( @xmath179 ) the linear polarization of the ca ii ir triplet",
    "is dominated by the hanle effect if the magnetic field is weaker than about 10 g. in fact , while the contribution of the transverse zeeman effect is negligible for @xmath197 g the hanle effect creates fractional linear polarization signals of the order of @xmath180 already for horizontal magnetic fields as weak as 0.1 g ( see figs . 6 and 7 ) . for magnetic strengths @xmath198 g the contribution of the transverse zeeman effect to the linear polarization observed at the solar disk center should not be neglected .",
    "detection of @xmath3 and @xmath4 disk center signals caused either by the hanle effect alone ( if @xmath199 g ) or by the joint action of the hanle and transverse zeeman effects ( if @xmath198 g ) would require very high polarimetric sensitivity together with a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to at least resolve partially the magnetic field azimuth .",
    "given the weakness of the theoretical scattering polarization signals ( @xmath200 at @xmath179 ; @xmath201 at @xmath172 ) , the most favourable geometry for observing them is in quiet regions close to the limb . in this geometry the emergent linear polarization of the ca ii",
    "ir triplet is non - zero even if the magnetic field has a random azimuth within the spatio - temporal resolution element of the observation ( see figs .",
    "8 and 9 ) .",
    "moreover , for magnetic strengths sensibly weaker than 100 g the contribution of the transverse zeeman effect to the emergent linear polarization is expected to be smaller than that caused by atomic level polarization . for",
    "stronger fields ( e.g. , @xmath202 g ) the wings of the emergent @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles may show sizable features produced by the transverse zeeman effect , but the line - center amplitudes would still be dominated by atomic level polarization .    finally , we point out that information on the relative amplitudes and signs of the scattering polarization profiles of the ca ii ir triplet would be very useful to help constrain the thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet solar chromosphere . in principle , to determine the structure of the magnetic field via stokes inversion techniques is possible , although it would be easier if one is able to infer first the atmospheric thermal structure from the observed intensity spectrum .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 signals we have studied here should also be exploited to investigate the reliability of three - dimensional models of the solar chromosphere resulting from holistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the solar atmosphere . to this end",
    ", it suffices with confronting spectropolarimetric observations of the ca ii ir triplet with synthetic stokes profiles obtained by solving the non - lte problem of the 2nd kind in 3d snaphot models resulting from such mhd simulations .",
    "modeling the spectral line polarization produced by atomic level polarization and its modification by the hanle effect requires calculating , for multilevel systems , the excitation and ionization state of chemical species of given abundance that is consistent with both the intensity and polarization of the radiation field generated within the ( generally magnetized ) plasma under consideration .",

    "<S> the chromosphere of the quiet sun is a very important stellar atmospheric region whose thermal and magnetic structure we need to decipher for unlocking new discoveries in solar and stellar physics . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we need to identify and exploit observables sensitive to weak magnetic fields ( @xmath0 g ) and to the presence of cool and hot gas in the bulk of the solar chromosphere . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on an investigation of the hanle effect in two semi - empirical models of the quiet solar atmosphere with different chromospheric thermal structures . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that the linear polarization profiles produced by scattering in the ca ii ir triplet have thermal and magnetic sensitivities potentially of great diagnostic value . </S>",
    "<S> the linear polarization in the 8498   line shows a strong sensitivity to inclined magnetic fields with strengths between 0.001 and 10 g , while the emergent linear polarization in the 8542    and 8662    lines is mainly sensitive to magnetic fields with strengths between 0.001 and 0.1 g. the reason for this is that the scattering polarization of the 8542    and 8662    lines , unlike the 8498   line , is controlled mainly by the hanle effect in their ( metastable ) lower levels . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in regions with magnetic strengths sensibly larger than 1 g , their stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles are sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic field vector . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for given magnetic field configurations the sign of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles of the 8542    and 8662    lines is the same in both atmospheric models , while the sign of the linear polarization profile of the 8498   line turns out to be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the lower chromosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that spectropolarimetric observations providing information on the relative scattering polarization amplitudes of the ca ii ir triplet will be very useful to improve our empirical understanding of the thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet chromosphere . </S>"
