    "the first passage process or the first passage time ( fpt ) problem deals with the event where a diffusing particle or a random - walker firstly reaches a specific site at a specific time @xcite .",
    "these fpt problems have been studied in various research fields , such as statistical physics , chemistry @xcite and biological neuroscience @xcite . in finance , several authors @xcite have analysed tick - by - tick data of the us dollar / japanese yen ( usd / jpy ) exchange rate and studied the fpt distribution for which the fpt is defined by the time that the rate firstly moves out from a given range .    among these studies ,",
    "the usd / jpy exchange rates of the sony bank @xcite are reproduced from the market rates by using some _ rate windows _ with a width of @xmath4 yen @xcite .",
    "that is , if the usd / jpy market rate changes by more than @xmath4 yen , the sony bank rate for usd / jpy is updated to the market rate otherwise it remains constant . in this sense , it is possible for us to say that the procedure for determining the usd / jpy exchange rate of the sony bank is essentially the first passage process . despite many demands from various research fields and business in financial markets",
    ", one could obtain explicit analytical expressions or solutions of the fpt distribution only in very few cases .",
    "in addition , except for a few cases @xcite , most of the analytical expressions are of the ordinary wiener process ( ordinary brownian motion ) .    based on this fact ,",
    "here we propose a new approach to the problem of the fpt or first passage processes .",
    "our method is applicable not only to the wiener process but also to the anomalous diffusion of the non - gaussian l@xmath0vy flights or more complicated stochastic processes . to show the usefulness of our approach , we particularly focus on the fpt problems in the truncated l@xmath0vy flights @xcite , in which the arbitrarily large tail of the l@xmath0vy distribution is cut off . using the method",
    ", we find that the asymptotic scaling law of the fpt @xmath1 distribution changes from a @xmath2-law ( non - gaussian l@xmath0vy regime ) to a @xmath3-law ( gaussian regime ) at some crossover point .",
    "this fact means that the crossover between non - gaussian l@xmath0vy and gaussian regimes is observed not only in the distribution of the real - time step of the truncated l@xmath0vy flight , which was reported by mantegna and stanley @xcite , but also in the fpt distribution of the flight .",
    "moreover , we give a scaling relation on the crossover point with respect to the effective cut - off length of the l@xmath0vy distribution .",
    "the scaling relation enables us to predict the crossover point of the fpt distribution for a given truncated l@xmath0vy flight .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "in the next section , we explain general formalism of our method and apply it to the fpt problem for the wiener process , for which the solution of the fpt distribution is well - known , in order to check the validity of our method . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that our method is widely useful for a class of stable stochastic processes .",
    "we derive the fpt distribution for l@xmath0vy flight which includes gaussian and lorentzian stochastic processes as its special cases .",
    "for each stable stochastic process , we discuss the scaling law of the fpt distribution in the asymptotic regime .",
    "the analytical results are confirmed by computer simulations . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply our method to the fpt problem of the truncated l@xmath0vy flight and discuss the crossover in the scaling laws of the fpt distribution between non - gaussian l@xmath0vy and gaussian regimes .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "the problem we deal with in this paper is defined as follows .",
    "let us consider the stochastic process : @xmath5 .",
    "for this time series , the fpt @xmath1 is defined by @xmath6 . then , our problem is to obtain the distribution of @xmath1 , namely , the _ first passage time distribution _ @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "we evaluate the distribution of @xmath1 , that is @xmath7 , which is defined as the survival probability that the time series @xmath8 , starting from @xmath9 keeps staying within the range @xmath10 $ ] up to the time step @xmath11 .",
    "the problem we are dealing with is motivated by the real mechanism of the sony bank foreign exchange rate @xcite .",
    "the sony bank rate is the foreign exchange rate that the sony bank offers with reference to the market rate .",
    "basically , trades can be made on the web @xcite while the market is open .",
    "the sony bank rate depends on the market rate but is independent of the customers orders .",
    "if the usd / jpy market rate changes by @xmath12 yen or more , the sony bank rate for usd / jpy is updated to the market rate .",
    "for instance , for the stochastic process of the real market ( what we call _ tick - by - tick data _ ) : @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the sony bank rate stays flat from the time @xmath16 to @xmath17 , as the market rate is in the range of @xmath18 yen based on the market rate at @xmath16 .",
    "when the market rate exceeds the range of @xmath19 yen at @xmath20 , the sony bank rate is updated to the market rate .",
    "obviously , the time interval @xmath21 here corresponds to the fpt we explained above and it is worth while for us to evaluate its distribution @xmath7 to investigate statistical property of the sony bank usd / jpy rates . to calculate the fpt distribution @xmath7 for the time series @xmath8",
    ", we define the probability @xmath22 , which means the probability of the fpt is @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 means the heviside step function , namely , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "we usually solve a kind of ( fractal ) fokker - plank equations under some appropriate boundary conditions @xcite or use the so - called image method @xcite to discuss the fpt problem .",
    "however , as we saw in equation ( [ eq : p1 ] ) , our approach is completely different from such standard treatments . to evaluate the fpt ( probability ) distribution ,",
    "say @xmath22 , we directly count the number of @xmath23 , namely , @xmath30 appearing within quite a long time interval @xmath31 .",
    "we might choose @xmath31 as a time interval during which the market is open .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath32 should be expected to converge to @xmath22 as @xmath31 tends to infinity .",
    "this is the meaning of equation ( [ eq : p1 ] ) and is our basic idea for evaluating the fpt distribution . from our method , to evaluate the fpt distribution by counting @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , the probability @xmath35 is also given by @xmath36 , that is to say , @xmath37 in the same way as the probability @xmath35 , the probability @xmath38 is obtained as @xmath39 we should notice that the probability @xmath22 was cancelled in this expression ( [ eq : p3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we easily generalise this kind of calculations to evaluate the distribution @xmath7 by repeating the above procedure as follows .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 were all cancelled in this final formula ( [ eq : general_def ] ) .",
    "this equation ( [ eq : general_def ] ) is the starting point of our evaluation . at a glance",
    ", this equation seems to be just a definition of the fpt distribution ; however , for some classes of stochastic processes , we can derive the explicit form of the fpt distribution from this simple equation . in the next subsection",
    ", we derive the fpt distribution for the wiener process as a simple test of our method .",
    "we stress that our approach helps as an intuitive account for the first passage process and derivation of its distribution .",
    "to show the validity and usefulness of our method , we derive the fpt distribution from the above expression ( [ eq : general_def ] ) for wiener stochastic processes ( brownian motion ) . the ordinary wiener process is described by @xmath42 , where the noise term @xmath43 obeys the white gaussian with zero - mean and variance @xmath44 .",
    "then , we should notice that the difference @xmath45 is rewritten in terms of the sum of the noise terms @xmath43 as @xmath46 .",
    "as is well - known , as the gaussian process is stable , @xmath47 obeys the gaussian with zero - mean and @xmath48 variance . using the same argument as @xmath47",
    ", @xmath49 also obeys the gaussian with zero - mean and @xmath50 variance .",
    "therefore , the fpt distribution @xmath7 derived by equation ( [ eq : general_def ] ) leads to @xmath51 when we assume that the underlying stochastic process is ergodic , namely , that time average and ensemble average coincide .",
    "for the ordinary wiener process , the probability distributions for @xmath47 and @xmath49 are gaussians with zero mean and variances @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "thus , we easily evaluate the integral appearing in ( [ eq : integ ] ) after substituting @xmath53 and obtain @xmath54 as @xmath55 where we defined @xmath56 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 .",
    "we should keep in mind that the above result is valid for discrete time @xmath1 , however ; it is easy for us to obtain its continuous time version by replacing @xmath59 , @xmath60 and evaluating ( [ eq : result_wiener ] ) in the limit of @xmath61 .",
    "then , we have @xmath62 thus , the fpt distribution for the ordinary wiener process in the continuous time limit is given by @xmath63 this well - known form is expected the inverse gaussian distribution @xcite for the fpt distribution of the ordinary wiener process and is often observed in the so - called inter - spike interval ( isi ) of the integrate - and - fire model for neural networks @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the asymptotic regime @xmath64 , the fpt distribution for the wiener process obeys @xmath3-scaling law . from the above discussion",
    ", we found that our new approach based on direct counting of the fpt to obtain the fpt distribution is effective and gives a well - known solution for the ordinary wiener process .",
    "before we move to the main section , we should comment on the much shorter derivation of the above formulation ( [ eq : result_wiener2 ] ) .",
    "let us define our stochastic process by @xmath65 and the probability density function finding the process in @xmath66 at time @xmath1 provided that it was in @xmath67 at time @xmath68 by @xmath69 . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath69 is symmetric with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "we also define the fpt with absorbing barriers @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "then , the complementary cumulative distribution of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 and the cumulative distribution function leads to @xmath74 thus , the fpt distribution is obtained by @xmath75 this equation coincides with equation ( [ eq : result_wiener2 ] ) .",
    "we should also mentioned that the similar derivations are found in the references @xcite .",
    "we stress that our method is widely applicable to stochastic processes whose distributions are stable .",
    "stable processes are specified as follows .",
    "if stochastic variables @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are identically independently distributed from @xmath78 , the fourier transform of the sum of the @xmath76 , namely , @xmath79 is given by @xmath80^{n } \\label{eq : irv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the fourier transform of the stochastic variable @xmath82 , namely , the characteristic function and defined by @xmath83 then , the stochastic process @xmath76 is referred to as a _ stable process_. strictly speaking , equation ( [ eq : irv ] ) is a possible definition of infinitely divisible random variables and not of stable random variables .",
    "a stable random variable is infinitely divisible and stability refers to the invariance of the distribution with respect to convolutions .",
    "it is obvious that for this class of stable processes , the fpt distribution is easily obtained by our method because the probability distributions @xmath84 and @xmath85 to evaluate @xmath86 in ( [ eq : pt_integ ] ) are defined explicitly . in the next subsections ,",
    "we show several results from our new approach .      as a first simple example of the stable distributions , let us think about lorentzian stochastic processes : @xmath87 , where the noise term @xmath43 obeys the following white lorentzian : @xmath88 then , the characteristic function of the stochastic variable @xmath43 is given by @xmath89 by using the convolution of the fourier transform for the variable @xmath90 , we have @xmath91^{n}= { \\rm e}^{-n \\gamma |q|}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the inverse fourier transform of @xmath92 leads to the probability distribution of the sum of noise term as follows .",
    "@xmath93 by substituting this probability @xmath94 into equations ( [ eq : pt_integ ] ) and ( [ eq : integ ] ) , we obtain the fpt distribution for the lorentzian stochastic processes as follows : @xmath95 where we defined @xmath96 . this is a result for discrete time steps ; however , its continuous version is easily obtained by using @xmath97 as follows .",
    "@xmath98 from this result ( [ eq : pt_lorentz ] ) , we find that the fpt distribution for the lorentzian stochastic processes obeys lorentzian . in the asymptotic regime @xmath64 ,",
    "the fpt distribution for the lorentzian stochastic processes obeys the @xmath99-scaling law .",
    "we next consider the case of l@xmath0vy stochastic processes whose noise term @xmath43 of the stochastic process @xmath87 obeys the following l@xmath0vy distribution : @xmath100 we should keep in mind that the above distribution ( [ eq : levy ] ) is reduced to the wiener stochastic process ( @xmath101 ) and the lorentzian stochastic process ( @xmath102 ) as its special cases . as this process @xmath43",
    "( @xmath103 ) is also stable , the sum of the noise term @xmath104 has the following probability distribution @xmath105 now , we can derive the fpt distribution by substituting @xmath106 into equations ( [ eq : pt_integ ] ) and ( [ eq : integ ] ) as @xmath107 expression of a continuous time version ( [ eq : pt_levy2 ] ) is obtained from the derivative of the above discrete time distribution @xmath7 with respect to @xmath1 as @xmath108 in the asymptotic regime @xmath64 , by replacing the variable as @xmath109 and after some simple algebra , we obtain @xmath110dq \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox { } & = &   \\psi ( \\alpha,\\gamma)\\ , t^{-(\\alpha + 1)/\\alpha }   \\label{eq : pt_levy } \\\\ % % % % % % % \\psi ( \\alpha,\\gamma )   & \\equiv &   \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\pi \\alpha^{2 } } \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty } \\gamma^{-(2l+1)/\\alpha } \\frac{(-1)^{l+1 } \\rho^{2l+1 } } { ( 2l ) ! } \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{2l + 1 } { \\alpha } \\right ) \\label{eq : pt_levy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath111 means gamma function and @xmath112 is a constant of order @xmath113 .",
    "then , we should notice that the above scaling law is consistent with both the wiener stochastic process ( @xmath114 for @xmath101 ) and with the lorentzian stochastic process ( @xmath115 for @xmath102 ) we discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "as we saw in the above stochastic processes , our new approach based on direct counting of the fpt is widely useful for the class of stable stochastic processes and the final expressions ( [ eq : pt_integ])([eq : integ ] ) , containing at most just two integrals .",
    "moreover , our approach can be applied to the fpt problems with a surprisingly wide variety of absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "this is one of the advantages of our method over other approaches based on analysis of fokker - plank equations . to show the advantage , in the next section , we apply our method to much more complicated stochastic stable process .      to check the theoretical prediction of the power - law exponent for the fpt distribution",
    ", we perform computer simulations .",
    "then , to generate the additive noise @xmath43 for each time step , the l@xmath0vy stable distribution @xmath116 is needed . as shown by umeno @xcite , the l@xmath0vy stable distribution is obtained by a superposition of a chaotic map such as @xmath117 namely , for independently selected initial conditions @xmath77 , the quantity @xmath118 obeys a l@xmath0vy stable law with @xmath119 , that is , @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_add1 ] , we plot the l@xmath0vy distribution with @xmath102 ( lorentzian ) and @xmath121 obtained by the superposition of the chaotic map ( [ eq : chaos_map ] ) .",
    "we set the number of the superposition of the chaotic map @xmath122 .    from this figure",
    ", we find that the distributions obtained by the simulations are in good agreement with the corresponding analytical expressions ( [ eq : theor_levy ] ) .",
    "keeping these results in mind , we use the sampling point from the superposition of the chaotic map ( [ eq : chaos_map ] ) as the additive noise @xmath43 in the stochastic process for each time step .",
    "then , we should notice that one should choose a large value for the width of the rate window @xmath123 , say , @xmath124 to investigate the tail of the fpt distribution .",
    "this is because it is a rare event for the random walker to stay in the range @xmath125 $ ] and it takes quite long computational time for us to obtain the tail exponent ( relatively long fpt ) if @xmath123 is small . here , we choose @xmath126 and evaluate the power - law exponent of the fpt distribution for the l@xmath0vy processes with @xmath102 and @xmath121 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_add2 ] .    from this figure",
    ", we find that the power - law tails have almost the same exponents as those predicted by our theory .",
    "of course , the tail region is too noisy to conclude that the simulations are completely consistent with the theory .",
    "however , at least , we may say that they are not in disagreement .",
    "thus , the computer simulations provided us with a justification of our theoretical formulation .",
    "in the previous section , we showed our new formulation is effective and much more simpler than the approach of the ( fractal ) fokker - plank equations @xcite to obtain the fpt distribution for stable stochastic processes .",
    "we actually found that the fpt distribution of the general non - gaussian l@xmath0vy stochastic process specified by parameter @xmath119 is obtained and its scaling behaviour in the asymptotic regime @xmath64 is @xmath2-law . in this section , we show that our formalism is also useful in obtaining the fpt distribution for the so - called _ truncated l@xmath0vy flight _ ( the so - called kobol processes from koponen , boyarchenko and levendorskii @xcite ) , for which it is well - known that the crossover between the a l@xmath0vy and a gaussian regime in the distribution of the real time step takes place @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we show , by using our method based on direct counting of the fpt , this kind of crossover in scaling laws is also observed in the fpt @xmath1 .",

    "obviously , this is identical to the characteristic function of the conventional l@xmath0vy flight as we already saw in the previous section .",
    "for this reason , a non - zero value of @xmath131 controls the cut - off width of the truncated l@xmath0vy flight .",
    "we should notice that one could also use a hard cut - off version of the truncation scheme @xcite , namely , @xmath132 however , for its mathematical simplicity , we use the soft cut - off version of the truncation scheme which will be explained below .    by the convolution of the fourier transform",

    "<S> we propose a new approach to the problem of the first passage time . </S>",
    "<S> our method is applicable not only to the wiener process but also to the non - gaussian l@xmath0vy flights or to more complicated stochastic processes whose distributions are stable . to show the usefulness of the method </S>",
    "<S> , we particularly focus on the first passage time problems in the truncated l@xmath0vy flights ( the so - called kobol processes ) , in which the arbitrarily large tail of the l@xmath0vy distribution is cut off . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymptotic scaling law of the first passage time @xmath1 distribution changes from @xmath2-law ( non - gaussian l@xmath0vy regime ) to @xmath3-law ( gaussian regime ) at the crossover point . </S>",
    "<S> this result means that an ultra - slow convergence from the non - gaussian l@xmath0vy regime to the gaussian regime is observed not only in the distribution of the real time step for the truncated l@xmath0vy flight but also in the first passage time distribution of the flight . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the crossover in the scaling laws and the scaling relation on the crossover point with respect to the effective cut - off length of the l@xmath0vy distribution are discussed . </S>"
