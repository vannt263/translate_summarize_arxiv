    "there has been a veritable explosion of data , discoveries and realizations in the past decade relating to the broad research area of the structure and content of nearby galaxies , particularly those in which it is possible to resolve the individual stars that contribute to the galaxy s luminosity , and to which this article exclusively refers . by necessity ,",
    "the objects of the attention of this research are the milky way , its satellites , and their neighbours within the so - called local group , but it is ever expanding to include the far richer sample of objects that fall within the loosely - defined part of the universe referred to only as the local volume .    the rapid growth in interest in this field can be traced to two , distinct , developments that have occurred in tandem .",
    "the first is entirely observational : nearby galaxies subtend large areas on the sky , and contain a high density of individually rather - faint stellar sources .",
    "thus , the advent of wide field , digital , high resolution , multiplexing capabilities on large telescopes ( and the computational facilities to handle the resulting data - flow ) have had a profound effect ( and will continue to do so ) .",
    "the second is the result of an increased understanding of the nature of our immediate cosmic environment , facilitated in no small part by computational tools ( hard- and soft - ware ) that have allowed for a higher - resolution examination of the consequences of the prevailing cosmological paradigm .",
    "the discoveries and realizations that these advances have enabled are significant : the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation , and the realization that some of the relics of that process may still be identifiable at @xmath0 ; the quest for a better understanding of dark matter , and the realization that the smallest galaxies nearest to us may be the darkest laboratories in the universe ; the chemical evolution of the universe , and the realization that the nucleosynthetic imprints of the earliest generations of star formation may still be found in the galaxy and its satellites .",
    "these are but a few examples .",
    "a new phrase has developed to collectively describe the aforementioned research and its motivations , and which contrasts it with its higher - redshift cousins : `` near - field cosmology '' .",
    "the phrase `` near - field cosmology '' is relatively recent , and dates from the annual review article of @xcite . as such ,",
    "it is sometimes considered a new field within astrophysics as a whole , although this is grossly unfair to its early exponents .",
    "indeed , what could be argued as two of the most important papers in astrophysics  that of @xcite and @xcite  are quintessential examples of observational near - field cosmology .",
    "the former took a well - defined sample of stars for which high quality spectroscopic and photometric data existed and from that motivated a collapse model for the formation of the galaxy .",
    "the latter used complexities within the stellar populations of the galactic globular cluster system to motivate a scenario where the galaxy ( or part of it ) is built through the accretion of smaller stellar systems .",
    "the principle ideas from both papers continue to form critical aspects of modern galaxy formation theory .",
    "many more galaxies are now able to have their resolved stellar content examined than was possible at the time of these early studies .",
    "the content and structure of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) provides an excellent comparison ( and , increasingly , contrast ) to our own galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . even excluding this prominent astronomical target , however , there are still nearly a hundred or so galaxies for which their individual stars can be brought into focus by astronomers wanting to unearth fossil signatures of galactic formation",
    ".    the overwhelming majority of nearby galaxies  indeed , the overwhelming majority of galaxies in the entire universe  are dwarf galaxies .",
    "exactly how low a luminosity or how small a mass is required before a galaxy is deemed meager enough to warrant this popular designation is generally not well - defined or accepted .",
    "@xcite famously showed that when surface brightness is plotted against luminosity for elliptical galaxies , two relations are apparently formed , one for `` giant '' galaxies , and one for `` dwarf '' galaxies .",
    "this has usually been interpreted as evidence that these systems should be separated into two distinct groups ( in terms of different formation mechanisms ) .",
    "some more recent studies , on the other hand , suggest that there is actually a continuous sequence connecting the dwarf and giant regimes , and that the change in the form of the scaling relations with luminosity does not necessitate fundamental differences between low and high luminosity systems ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . with these considerations in mind , and for the purpose of this article , i consider dwarfs to have absolute visual magnitudes fainter than @xmath1 ( also adopted by @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows , this places all nearby galaxies but the milky way , the large magellanic cloud , m31 , m33 , ngc55 and ngc300 in the dwarf category .",
    "the closest galaxies to the milky way are its own satellites , the most prominent of which are the large and small magellanic clouds ( l / smc ) , both of which are naked eye objects .",
    "the earliest reference to the magellanic clouds that survives is by the persian astronomer abd al - rahman al - sufi in his 964 work , _",
    "`` book of fixed stars '' _ ( which also includes the earliest recorded reference to the andromeda galaxy ) .",
    "a millennium or so later , @xcite discovered `` a large rich cluster with remarkable characteristics '' in the constellation of sculptor .",
    "he speculated that it was    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` ... a super - cluster of the globular type and of galactic dimensions ; or a symmetrical magellanic cloud devoid of its characteristic bright stars , clusters , and luminous diffuse nebulosity ; or a nearby spheroidal galaxy , highly resolved , and of abnormally low surface brightness .",
    "these phrases are merely different ways of describing the same thing and of pointing out the uniqueness of the object . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    over seventy years later , a large body of research still devotes itself to understanding the detailed properties , structural , chemical and dynamical characteristics of this class of stellar system .",
    "the prototype described above is referred to as the sculptor dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy .",
    "excellent discussions of the observational properties of  and our astrophysical understanding of  the nearest ( local group ) dwarf galaxies can be found in a large number of dedicated review articles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the compilations of observational data presented in numerous works by s. van den bergh , in particular @xcite , and the annual review article by @xcite are particularly valuable resources for the astronomical community . since their original publication , however , there have been notable advances ( in part a product of the observational and theoretical factors described earlier ) .",
    "not least of these is the _ more - than - doubling _ of the number of known galaxies in the local group . in the surrounding of the local group too , there have been significant new discoveries , and techniques and observations that used to be applicable only to the milky way satellites or nearby local group galaxies can now be applied to these more distant relatives .",
    "the ability to reach the resolved populations of ever more distant galaxies is important not just for the improvement in statistics that it offers , but also in terms of the increasing range of environments that it allows us to study . the overwhelming amount of detailed information regarding the stellar population properties of dwarf galaxies comes from studies of the mw satellite systems .",
    "given the sensitivity of low mass systems to both internal ( e.g. , feedback through star formation ) and external ( e.g. , ram and tidal stripping ) environmental mechanisms , this might be expected to bias our understanding towards conditions that hold only for the mw environment . within the very nearby universe , however , there are a large number of environments able to be probed , from the surroundings of the mw and m31 , to the more isolated , outlying members of the local group , to the very isolated dwarf galaxies that surround the local group , to the numerous nearby groups that populate and form our immediate neighbourhood .",
    "a large number of dedicated surveys in the past few years are systematically examining galaxies in the local volume at a range of wavelengths , and which include among their targets some of the more distant galaxies in this sample .",
    "these surveys are obtaining precision insights into local galaxies that naturally compliment lower resolution studies of their more numerous , but more distant , cousins ( e.g. , sings , @xcite ; the spitzer lvl ( @xcite ; things , @xcite ; figgs , @xcite ; hst angrrr / angst , @xcite ; the galex survey of galaxies in the local volume , @xcite ; the h@xmath2 survey of @xcite ; and many others ) .",
    "i have alluded to several motivations for pursuing studies of nearby galaxies , be they related to cosmic chemical processing , dynamical evolution , galactic formation mechanisms , environment , near field cosmology or a wealth of other research areas on which much can be written .",
    "it is not the purpose of this article to contribute to those discussions here ; the recent annual review article by @xcite provides an excellent , current overview of the status of research into many of these topics using local group galaxies .",
    "rather , this article attempts to collate , homogenize and critically review our observational understanding of aspects of the nearby populations of dwarf galaxies , with particular emphasis on the origins and uncertainties of some key observable parameters .",
    "i will discuss science topics only when such discussions relate directly to observational measurements and those measurements , in my opinion , provide grounds for caution , or when such discussion provides a context for highlighting observational relationships between parameters .",
    "this article primarily focuses on the stellar properties of the galaxies ( and derived properties , such as the implied dark matter content ) , and cites observations conducted mostly at ultraviolet  optical  near - infrared wavelengths , with less discussion on their gaseous and dust content . with the intense efforts currently underway to provide a more full characterization of these systems ,",
    "i expect some numbers provided in this article will be out - of - date by the time it is published . as such , tables presented herein will be continually updated to provide a convenient , on - line library of dwarf galaxy parameters for general reference and use by the community .",
    "the layout of the article is as follows .",
    " 2 describes the selection of the sample and gives a general summary of my methodology and reasoning in the construction of the dataset . ",
    "3 reviews the discovery space of the galaxies , and discusses general issues relating to distances , velocities and the membership ( or otherwise ) of larger - scale groups / sub - groups .",
    " 4 reviews the observed photometric and structural characteristics of the sample and discusses aspects of the scaling relations that they define .",
    " 5 reviews their masses ( stellar , hi and dynamical ) and internal kinematics , and discusses issues related to morphological classifications and our dynamical understanding of the sample . ",
    "6 presents a compilation of available mean stellar metallicities and discusses associated observational trends .",
    " 7 concludes and summarizes .",
    "the sample of galaxies discussed in this article consist of all known galaxies with distances determined from measurements of resolved stellar populations ( usually cepheids , rr lyrae , tip of the red giant branch , trgb , but also including horizontal branch level and main - sequence fitting ; see @xcite for a thorough discussion of the former three methods and references ) that place them within 3mpc of the sun .",
    "consequently , this sample contains the satellite systems of two major galaxies ( the mw and m31 ) , the quasi - isolated , outlying members of the local group , and the nearby isolated dwarf galaxies that do not clearly belong to any major galaxy grouping .",
    "it is therefore expected that this sample may be valuable ( as , indeed , various individual members and sub - sets have already proven valuable ) for examining the role played by environment in dwarf galaxy evolution , as discussed in  1 .",
    "there is also a practical motivation for the choice of distance limit ; namely , that a much larger threshold will start to select members of nearby groups ( the closest of which is the maffei group at @xmath3mpc , although its awkward location at low galactic latitudes prevents accurate distances being determined for its members ; see @xcite ) , and would expand the scope of this article considerably .    of course",
    ", there are no solid boundaries between galaxy groups , filaments and the field , and some of the galaxies discussed herein are likely dynamically associated with neighboring structures like the sculptor ( e.g. , @xcite ) or ic342 ( e.g. , @xcite ) groups , for example .",
    "nevertheless , at the time of writing , the adoption of these selection criteria identifies exactly 100 galaxies ( not including the mw and m31 ) , of which 73 are definite or very likely members of the local group .",
    "it is likely that our basic knowledge of all of these galaxies and their resolved stellar content can be improved dramatically over the coming years with existing observational capabilities , and the more distant galaxies provide stepping stones into the local volume for future resolved stellar population studies enabled by next generation facilities like the thirty - meter class telescopes .",
    "it is with an eye to these latter considerations that the distance is not limited to the zero - velocity surface of the local group ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the ensuing discussion will focus on dwarf galaxies .",
    "of the 102 galaxies that are listed in the subsequent tables , virtually no discussion will be given to the milky way and m31 , and numbers relating to m33 , ngc55 and ngc300 are included for completeness only .",
    "the same caveat applies to the magellanic clouds , since here the research body and available data are so extensive and far exceeds that which exists for most other dwarf - like systems that the reader is referred to the many review articles , books , and conferences that deal specifically with these bodies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in compiling this catalog of galaxies , and in addition to the papers cited in each table ,",
    "i have made extensive use of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , the hyperleda database ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the requirement that all galaxies have distances based on resolved stellar populations leads to the exclusion of a few galaxies that have low velocities that could potentially place them within 3mpc , but which lack any direct distance measurement ( e.g. , see table  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the low latitude galaxy dwingeloo  1 is also excluded by this criterion , since its distance of @xmath5mpc is based on a tully - fisher estimate ( @xcite ; this galaxy is very likely a member of the maffei group ) .",
    "the ( uncertain ) trgb measurement of mcg9 - 20 - 1 by @xcite places it at a distance of @xmath6mpc , although its radial velocity of @xmath7kms@xmath8 is very high if it is really this close , and the photometric data now seem to favor a larger distance ( k. gilbert & j. dalcanton , private communication ) , so it too has been excluded from the list .",
    "finally , there are a few galaxies for which it is unclear if they lie closer or further than 3mpc ( e.g. , ugca 92 , @xmath9mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "i exclude such galaxies , even if the quoted uncertainties would bring them within range of the distance cut . of course",
    ", if future estimates should clearly indicate a closer distance , then the on - line version of the tables will be updated as appropriate .    in compiling these references ,",
    "i have favored , where possible , papers that are based on analysis of the resolved stellar populations . in the interest of homogeneity and in an ( ill - fated ) attempt to minimize the inevitable systematic differences between measurements for different galaxies ,",
    "i also generally try to limit the number of distinct publications , studies and/or methodologies that contribute to the overall dataset , favoring large surveys of multiple galaxies in preference to studies of individual galaxies .",
    "however , if there appear to be significant discrepancies in the literature over observed values , then these differences are indicated in either the footnotes and/or the text .",
    "infrequently , i have estimated uncertainties where none were given in the original publications .",
    "my primary intent in compiling this dataset is to provide useful information on the population of ( dwarf ) galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "i have tried to ensure that the references collected herein  while not complete in any way  are generally recent enough and relevant enough that i hope they will be able to provide the reader with a starting point from which most of the germane literature can be traced .",
    "table  1 lists basic information for all nearby galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria discussed in the previous section :    * column 1 : galaxy name ; * column 2 : common alternative names ; * column 3 : indicator whether they are associated with mw [ g ] , m31 [ a ] , the local group [ l ] , or are nearby neighbors [ n ] ; * column 4 : morphological ( hubble ) type .",
    "the distinction between dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) is based solely on luminosity , and is therefore somewhat arbitrary .",
    "objects fainter than @xmath1 are given a `` d '' ( dwarf ) prefix , and is again somewhat arbitrary ; * column 5 , 6 : celestial coordinates ( j2000 ) ; * column 7 : original publication .",
    "for more details relating to the discoveries of the ngc / ic galaxies , the reader is referred to @xcite ; * column 8 : comments .    table  2 lists position and velocity information for the galaxy sample :    * column 1 : galaxy name ; * columns 2 , 3 : galactic coordinates @xmath10 ; * column 4 : foreground extinction , e(b - v ) : these correspond to values derived by @xcite from an all - sky cobe / dirbe and iras / issa 100@xmath11 m map , at the coordinates of the centroid of each galaxy . while @xcite estimate that values for e(b - v )",
    "are generally accurate to 16% , a major ( and sometimes overlooked , including by this author ! )",
    "caveat for their use in the direction of nearby ( large ) galaxies is that the brightest galaxies at iras 60@xmath11 m were excised from these maps and replaced by the `` most likely value '' of the underlying 100@xmath11 m emission ( see  4.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting values are not , therefore , directly observed , and any variation across the area occupied by the galaxy is not traced by these maps . for this compilation ,",
    "the affected galaxies are ngc6822 , ic1613 , m33 , ngc205 , ngc3109 , ngc55 and ngc300 .",
    "the lmc , smc and m31 ( and by necessity also m32 ) were not excised ; * columns 5 , 6 : distance modulus , heliocentric distance : all distance moduli are based on resolved stellar population analysis ( generally cepheid , rr  lyrae or trgb measurements , but also horizontal branch level and main - sequence fitting ) . note that many trgb estimates do not include the formal uncertainty in the absolute magnitude of the trgb ( @xcite ) ; * column 7 : heliocentric velocity : for most local group galaxies , the velocity corresponds to the optical velocity of the galaxy .",
    "for some of the more distant galaxies , velocities are measured from hi ; * column 8  10 : distance - velocity pairs for the galactocentric ( mw ) , m31 and local group frames - of - reference : these are calculated by first assuming that the barycenter of the local group is located at the mid - point of the vector connecting the mw and m31 ( for an adopted m31 distance modulus of @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter galaxy is more luminous ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , but dynamical mass estimates for both of these galaxies have produced conflicting results regarding which is more massive ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a result nearly exclusively due to the lack of a sufficient number of dynamical tracers at large radii . given this uncertainty , i conclude that assuming their masses to be roughly the same is reasonable , simple and convenient .",
    "velocities are converted to the local group frame using the solar apex derived by @xcite and subtracting the component of the mw s velocity in the direction of each dwarf .",
    "m31-centric velocities are obtained by subtracting the component of the local group - centric velocity of m31 in the direction of each dwarf .",
    "galactocentric distances and velocities are calculated in the usual way , for an adopted galactic rotation velocity at the sun of 220kms@xmath8 at a radius of 8.5kpc from the galactic center ; * column 11 : references .",
    "figure  1 shows aitoff projections of the galactic coordinates of all galaxies in the sample .",
    "the top panel shows only those objects identified as definite or likely mw satellites ; the middle panel shows definite or likely m31 sub - group members ( blue points ) and quasi - isolated local group galaxies ( green points ) ; the bottom panel shows galaxies surrounding the local group within a distance of 3mpc .",
    "some confirmed members of all galaxy groups within 5mpc are also shown in the bottom panel ( grey points ) to highlight the location of the local group and its neighbors with respect to these nearby structures ( @xcite ) . in this respect , it is important to highlight the work of i. karachentsev , b. tully and their colleagues in both the identification of nearby galaxies and groups , and in the determination of accurate distances to many of our neighbours in order to understand the structure of the local volume ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "figure  2 shows galactocentric velocity versus distance for all galaxies within 600kpc for which necessary data exist . here ,",
    "the galactocentric velocity listed in table  2 has been multiplied by a factor of @xmath13 to provide a crude estimate of the unknown tangential velocities of these galaxies .",
    "dashed curves show the escape velocity from a @xmath14 point mass ( a reasonable approximation to the escape velocity curve of the mw for the purposes of this discussion ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the approximate cosmological virial radius of the mw , @xmath15kpc ( @xcite ; these authors define @xmath16 as the radius within which the mean density of the model dark matter halo is a factor @xmath17 larger than the critical density of the universe ) .    with the obvious caveat regarding the generally unknown tangential components of the velocities of the galaxies , figure  2",
    "can be used to define membership of the mw subgroup . in particular , all galaxies within 300kpc of the mw are likely bound satellites .",
    "this is with the exception of leo  i , which may be unbound unless its tangential components are significantly overestimated ( also see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "leo  t , ngc6822 and phoenix may all be bound in this simple model , but their large distance from the mw makes their membership of the mw subgroup ambiguous .",
    "i note that no potential satellite of the mw or m31 (  3.2 ) is clearly unbound as a result of the magnitude of its radial velocity alone ; all the potential satellites with large radial velocities relative to their host may be bound if their tangential velocities are sufficiently small . for the purpose of the classification in column 3 of table  1 , and in the forthcoming discussion , i only include as definite mw satellites those objects that are bound by the dashed curves in figure 2 and which have @xmath18 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the radial distribution of satellites is such that they are found at all radii out to @xmath19kpc from the mw , at which point there is a notable gap in the distribution until the next set of objects at @xmath20kpc .",
    "a similar gap is present at a similar radius for satellites around m31 (  3.2 ; but see the recent discovery of andromeda  xxviii by @xcite ) .",
    "this tentatively suggests that this gap could be used to observationally define the limiting radius of the sub - groups ( or equivalently , the extent of the two host galaxies ) , and appears consistent with previous work and other galaxy groups ( e.g. , cen a , sculptor , ic342 : @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "pisces ii is the most recently discovered satellite to the mw ( @xcite ) , and does not appear in figure  2 since it currently lacks a velocity measurement . at the time of writing ,",
    "15 new satellites have been discovered since 2005 , all of them using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and hence confined to its footprint . @xcite",
    "originally argued that the mw sub - group was essentially complete at galactic latitudes away from the disk for objects of comparable luminosity ( or brighter ) than sextans .",
    "the fact that only one of the new satellites ( canes venatici ) is comparable in luminosity to any of the previously known mw satellites backs up this claim .",
    "indeed , @xcite demonstrates that most of the newly discovered galaxies are at the limits of detection of sdss , and implies that  even within the sdss footprint ",
    "a large number of galaxies still await discovery .",
    "this was explored further by @xcite , who conclude that there may by many hundreds of unseen faint satellites .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the problems caused by the galactic disk in searching for satellites .",
    "figure  3 shows the distribution of mw satellites with ( absolute ) latitude .",
    "the histogram shows the observed distribution of all 27 satellites , whereas the dashed line indicates a uniform distribution , normalised to match observations at @xmath21 .",
    "there are 3 satellite at @xmath22 ( one of which is canis major , on which there is still considerable debate as to whether it is a dwarf galaxy or an unrelated disk substructure ; e.g. , @xcite ) , a number that is very low considering this accounts for half of the sky .",
    "obscuration by the galactic disk , however , does not become a serious problem until @xmath23 . while some of the area probed by sdss reaches to very low galactic latitudes , the majority of the legacy area is located at @xmath24 , likely explaining the dearth of satellites at intermediate latitudes .",
    "two photometric surveys currently underway  the pan - starrs ( @xcite ) ps1 survey in the north and skymapper ( @xcite ) in the south  together will map the entire sky to equivalent or deeper magnitude limits to sdss , and consequently should reveal the presence of many more satellites .",
    "these should remove the spatial bias introduced by sdss .",
    "in addition , other wide - field ( but not all - hemisphere ) surveys such as that made possible with the soon - to - be - commissioned subaru / hypersuprimecam will allow for even fainter satellites to be detected ( if they exist ) . in the more distant future , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst )",
    "will re - examine the southern hemisphere sky to even greater depth .",
    "judging by recent discoveries , there is every reason to expect large numbers of very faint satellites will be discovered by all these projects .",
    "however , objects behind the galactic plane will likely remain hidden , and it is unlikely that ( m)any bright ( @xmath25 ) galactic dwarf galaxies at higher galactic latitudes remain to be discovered      figure  4 shows m31-centric velocity versus distance for all galaxies within 600kpc of andromeda for which these measurements exist . again , the m31-centric velocity listed in table  2 has been multiplied by a factor of @xmath13 to account for the unknown tangential velocities of these galaxies .",
    "following figure  2 , dashed curves show the escape velocity from a @xmath14 point mass , and the vertical dashed line indicates the approximate cosmological virial radius of the m31 , @xmath26kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whereas only leo  i around the mw stands out as a possible unbound satellite from its radial velocity ( @xcite ) , m31 has at least two close - in dwarf galaxies which are likely unbound , andromeda xii ( @xcite ) and xiv ( @xcite ) . the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy ( dig ) and ic1613 are both extremely distant from andromeda , but",
    "could arguably be dynamically associated . in this respect",
    "they are similar to ngc6822 , leot and phoenix around the mw .",
    "it is often overlooked that ic10 and lgs3 are clear m31 satellites ( as close to m31 as the andromeda vi and xvi dsphs ) . however , these two galaxies differ from the majority of satellites insofar as they both have non - negligible gas fractions and younger stellar populations",
    ". lgs3 is generally classified as being morphologically akin to leot ( a `` transition - type '' dwarf ; see  5 for discussion ) , whereas ic10 is generally classified as a low mass dwarf irregular .",
    "indeed , as a whole , the m31 satellite system contrasts with the mw satellites in the variety of morphological types present . around the mw , only the lmc and smc are not classified as dsphs .",
    "however , in addition to the dsph satellites , m31 also has a transition dwarf ( lgs3 ) , a dwarf irregular ( ic10 , although it is much lower luminosity than either of the magellanic clouds ) , three dwarf elliptical galaxies ( ngc205 , 147 and 185 ) , a compact elliptical ( m32 ) and a low mass spiral galaxy ( m33 ) .    the last seven years has seen a rapid growth in the number of known m31 satellites through focused wide - field studies of the environment around andromeda .",
    "all the new dwarfs have been discovered as overdensities of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "this , therefore , imposes a basic magnitude limit on the galaxies that can be found , since it requires galaxies to have enough stars that a reasonable number are passing though the rgb phase .",
    "an exact study of the selection effects for dwarf galaxy searches around m31 has yet to be published , but the practical limit of these searches appears to be around @xmath27 .",
    "the most extensive survey of m31 s environs , by the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ; @xcite ) provides complete spatial coverage out to a maximum projected radius from m31 of 150kpc .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , the projected radial distribution of satellites shows no sign of declining within this radius .",
    "it is highly probable , therefore , that a large number of satellites remain to be discovered at large projected radius ( recently verified by the discoveries of andromeda xxviii ( @xcite ) and andromeda xxix ( @xcite ) in the sdss dr8 ) . at small radius ( @xmath28kpc )",
    ", there is also a deficit of galaxies due to the dominance of m31 stellar populations in this region making it difficult to identify any low luminosity satellites that may be superimposed in front of ( or behind ) the main body of m31 .    within both the mw and the m31 sub - group",
    "there are at least three potential dynamical associations of satellites ( `` sub - sub - groups '' ) . around the mw , leo  iv and v are in close proximity to each other ( positions and velocities ) and may well constitute a binary system ( @xcite ) . within the m31 sub - group ,",
    "andromeda  xxii is only about 40kpc in projection from m33 , whereas it is over 200kpc in projection from m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus andromeda  xxii may actually be the only known satellite of m33 ( the bright dsph andromeda ii is also considerably closer to m33 than m31 , but in a region where the gravitational potential of m31 clearly dominates ) .",
    "a second possible pairing is found to the north of m31 , and includes ngc185 and 147 .",
    "@xcite postulated that ngc185 and 147 were a binary system ; they are separated by only 1 degree in projection and their distances imply a three dimensional separation of @xmath29kpc .",
    "their velocities differ by only @xmath30kms@xmath8 , and such a small separation in phase - space seems unlikely ( but not impossible ) if these galaxies are not , or never have been , a binary system .",
    "figure  5 shows local group - centric velocity versus distance from the barycenter of the local group for all galaxies in the sample for which these data exist .",
    "the local group - centric velocity listed in table  2 has been multiplied by a factor of @xmath13 to account for the unknown tangential components .",
    "dashed curves indicate the escape velocity from a point mass of @xmath31 .",
    "dotted curves indicate the escape velocity from a point mass of @xmath32 , the approximate total dynamical mass of the local group as implied from the timing argument ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many of the points at @xmath33kpc represent galaxies that are satellites of either the mw or m31 .",
    "these systems are dynamically dominated by the gravitational potential of these massive hosts rather than the local group as a whole .",
    "there is a clear separation in figure  5 between outer , apparently bound , local group members ( the outermost of which is ugc 4879 ) , and the next nearest galaxies ( the four members of the ngc3109 grouping , see @xcite ) .",
    "the rise in velocity with distance for all the nearby neighbors is due to the hubble expansion , and the reader is referred to @xcite for a beautiful analysis of the hubble flow around the local group .",
    "the six outermost local group members cluster around @xmath34 , and their mean velocity is consistent with zero ( @xmath35kms@xmath8 , where the uncertainty is the random error in the mean ) . as such",
    ", their mean distance can be used as an estimate of the zero - velocity surface of the local group , and is @xmath36kpc ( where the uncertainty is the random error in the mean ; cf . @xcite and others ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the velocity dispersion of the local group can be estimated using those local group galaxies that are far from either the mw or m31 and that have published velocities .",
    "the six local group galaxies identified in figure 5 , with the addition of ic1613 and cetus , are all more than 500kpc from either of the two large galaxies , and yield @xmath37kms@xmath8 ( where the uncertainty is the random error in the dispersion ) .",
    "note that there is a systematic error component in all these estimates caused by our choice for the location of the barycenter of the local group , although it has a generally weak effect on any values given here .",
    "the fact that the measured velocity dispersion for the entire local group is so low that it is of order the velocity dispersion of the gas in the smc is peculiar and well noted ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it may result from the necessity to measure the dispersion from galaxies that are mostly at or near turn - around .",
    "not including satellites of the mw and m31 , it is highly likely that the census of local group galaxies remains severely incomplete . unlike recently discovered mw satellites ,",
    "isolated local group galaxies are not nearby . unlike the m31 sub - group , isolated local group galaxies do not cluster in a specific area of sky amenable to dedicated surveys .",
    "the middle panel of figure  1 shows that 8 of the 13 ( quasi-)isolated local group galaxies are all in one quadrant of the sky ( the same one that contains m31 ) .",
    "however , it is also not clear what the expected spatial distribution of non - satellite local group galaxies should be , and it is likely naive to expect an isotropic distribution .",
    "heroic searches for new local group galaxies and nearby neighbours have been made by groups lead by i. karachentsev , v. karachentseva ( e.g. , @xcite and many others ) and a. whiting ( @xcite ) through the visual inspection of literally every plate of the second palomar observatory sky survey and the eso / science research council survey , and these remain the most comprehensive all - sky searches to - date .",
    "@xcite attempt to quantify their visual search of these plates ; they estimate that their search is @xmath38 complete in the region away from interference from the mw disk ( more than 70% of the sky ) to a surface brightness level approaching 26magsarcsec@xmath39 .",
    "this translates to ( at most ) 1 or 2 currently uncatalogued local group members down to this limit , away from the disk of the galaxy .",
    "current and future large - scale digital surveys of the sky - including blind hi surveys as well as optical studies - are potentially rich hunting grounds to try to improve the census of nearby galaxies , be they members of the local group or the nearby neighbors that help define its environment .",
    "table  3 presents global photometric and structural parameters for each galaxy in the sample :    * column 1 : galaxy name ; * column 2 : apparent magnitude in v ( vega magnitudes ) . in general , these have been corrected for foreground extinction ( but not internal extinction ) , although in some cases the original papers are unclear as to whether extinction corrections were applied to the apparent magnitudes . for many of the fainter galaxies that have been resolved into stars ,",

    "i have assumed circular isophotes ; * column 10 : references ; * column 11 : comments .    for each galaxy",
    "i have tried to minimize the number of different papers that i cite to provide complete information , with the result that table  3 references 45 papers from the last 21 years .",
    "concern must be given to the systematic uncertainties that exist between measurements : they are necessarily complex , they are essentially unquantifiable , and they probably present the primary limitation for examination of the global properties of this population .    despite the usefulness of parameters such as total luminosity and half - light radius , it should be strongly stressed that these numbers are wholly inadequate in reflecting the known complexity of galaxy structures .",
    "it is standard practice to decompose bright galaxies into components such as nucleus and envelope , or a bulge , a disk ( several disks ? ) , and a halo .",
    "more recently , however , a vast number of independent studies of galaxies included in table  3 have shown that a full description of their structure requires decomposition of their surface brightness profile into multiple components ( e.g. , @xcite , among many others ) .",
    "the addition of spectroscopic data ( see  5 ) adds new complexity to the discussion as well , since dynamically distinct ( e.g. , @xcite ) and chemo - dynamically distinct ( e.g. , @xcite ) populations of stars have been shown to reside within individual dwarf galaxies that do not necessarily always reveal themselves as features in the global surface brightness profiles .",
    "thus , not only are integrated photometric properties such as @xmath44 and @xmath45 inadequate to describe the complex structures exhibited by many galaxies , but so too are single velocity dispersion or rotation measurements (  5 ; true for hi as well as stars ; e.g. , @xcite ) .    figure 6 and 7 show basic scaling relations using the galaxy parameters given in table  3 , first studied in detail in @xcite . in figure 6 ,",
    "i plot absolute magnitude against half - light radius .",
    "here , i have converted the half - light radius given in table  3 to the geometric mean half - light radius of the major and minor axes ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are radii measured on the major and minor axes , respectively ) to account for the presence of highly elliptical systems .",
    "the top panel includes as small dots the location of the galactic globular clusters , from the data compiled by @xcite , and the dashed line shows the direction defined by points of constant surface brightness ( averaged within the half - light radius ) .",
    "i have labeled obvious outlying points , and i have also labeled some of the least luminous ( candidate ) dwarf galaxies .",
    "the lower panel shows an expansion of the region @xmath49 .    the observed relationship between absolute magnitude  half - light radius shown in the top panel of figure  6 spans a factor of one million in luminosity .",
    "the galaxies seem well separated from the ( galactic ) globular clusters in this two dimensional projection , although the limited number of low luminosity galaxies ( and the fact that all of them are mw satellites ) complicates interpretation of this region of the diagram . when @xmath45 and @xmath44 are considered separately , the one - dimensional distributions do overlap , such that the smallest , least - luminous ( candidate ) dwarf galaxies are as faint as any known globular clusters and smaller than the most extended clusters .",
    "the distinction between these stellar systems in this parameter space becomes less clear when other types of compact stellar systems , such as ultra - compact dwarfs and the nuclei of early - type galaxies , are included ( e.g. , see figures  5 and  8 of @xcite ) .",
    "three galaxies are clear outliers in the top panel of figure  6 : andromeda  xix is extremely extended for its luminosity ( see also figure  7 ) , whereas the compact elliptical m32 is a known outlier in this projection due to its extreme concentration ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the recently identified local group galaxy ugc4879 ( @xcite ) tends to the same side of the relation as m32 , although not as extreme . @xcite note that ugc4879 has an unusual structure , insofar as there appears to be two flattened wings emanating from the central spheroid of stars , perhaps indicating the presence of a disk .",
    "more work is needed to determine the significance of the structure of ugc4879 and its position in this diagram .",
    "the lower panel of figure  6 enlarges the region @xmath50 to demonstrate the very large scatter that exists in this regime ( see below for discussion of the fainter systems ) .",
    "@xcite originally pointed out that , at a given luminosity , the m31 dwarf satellites were generally larger than the mw population . with a large number of new discoveries since this time , @xcite demonstrate that the mean relations of the m31 and mw populations are statistically consistent with each other .",
    "the limited number of points contributing to the relations for these different sub - groups makes interpretation difficult ; for example , four out of ten mw satellites have @xmath51pc , whereas 20 out of 26 m31 satellites are this large",
    ". it may be that local environment contributes to determining the sizes of dwarf galaxies , but perhaps the most important conclusion that can be drawn from the lower panel of figure  6 is the _ lack _ of a strong relation between @xmath52 in this regime ; at any given luminosity , galaxy sizes vary by nearly an order of magnitude , and there is only a weak dependence on luminosity .    at even fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the line of constant surface brightness ( averaged within the half - light radius ) included in the top panel of figure 6 runs approximately parallel to the relation defined by the galaxy locus for @xmath53 ( and this also has a different slope than the weak relation at brighter magnitudes ) .",
    "this indicates that the smallest galaxies so far discovered all have similar surface brightnesses and further suggests that selection effects may be driving the form of the @xmath52 relation at faint magnitudes . to explore this further , i plot surface brightness against absolute magnitude in figure 7 .",
    "the top panel shows the central surface brightness , whereas the bottom panel uses the average surface brightness within the half - light radius .",
    "the former is in principle more susceptible to localized features ( e.g. , nuclei , individual bright stars , etc . ) than the latter .",
    "i have labeled points that are obvious outliers in _ both _ panels ( note that bootes iii is not present in the lower panel of figure 7 due to the lack of a measured value for @xmath44 ) .",
    "these galaxies are all known or suspected to be undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "there is a clear correlation between absolute magnitude and surface brightness in both panels of figure 7 for galaxies more luminous than @xmath54 . of considerable interest",
    ", however , is the change in the observed relationship between surface brightness and absolute magnitude _ within _ the dwarf regime . in particular , dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath55 do not continue to decrease in surface brightness with decreasing luminosity . instead",
    ", the surface brightness levels off at faint magnitudes , as implied in figure  6 . the central surface brightness distribution for the 26 galaxies fainter than @xmath56 in figure  7 can be characterized by a median surface brightness of @xmath57magsarcsec@xmath39 and an inter - quartile range of 1.2 magnitudes .",
    "thus , the central surface brightness for galaxies fainter than @xmath56 appears remarkably constant given that the luminosity changes by a factor of @xmath58 within the sample .",
    "surface brightness selection effects must be seriously considered in examining the correlations in figure  7 ( see , for example , earlier discussion by @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    ", the work of @xcite provides the most relevant reference .",
    "the selection functions are complex and depend on distance , magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "however , table  3 of @xcite indicates that galaxies as faint as @xmath59 , at distances of @xmath60kpc could be recovered even if their central surface brightness is as faint as 29.9magsarcsec@xmath39 , more than 2 magnitudes fainter than the median observed surface brightness at faint luminosities .",
    "there is also tentative evidence that the m31 satellites appear to behave in a similar way to the mw satellites ( although they do not extend to the same low luminosity limits ) .",
    "searches for m31 satellites are subject to different ( and as yet unquantified ) selection effects compared to the mw satellites .",
    "taken together , it appears possible that the `` break '' in the scaling relations at around @xmath54 may be real .",
    "if so , it may imply that  as a result of either formation ( e.g. , inflow of gas into dark matter haloes ) or subsequent feedback / evolution ( e.g. , star formation )  there is a low - density limit to the central stellar densities of dwarf galaxies .",
    "if the effect is instead due to selection , then we are only observing those low luminosity galaxies with the highest surface brightness , indicating that there may be very significant scatter in this property at faint magnitudes .",
    "regardless of this speculation , the behavior of surface brightness with luminosity shown in figure 7 certainly requires further consideration and explanation .",
    "table  4 lists various information regarding the masses and kinematics of the galaxy sample :    * column 1 : galaxy name ; * column 2 : mass of the galaxy in stellar masses , assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 1 .",

    "note that the hi velocity dispersion is affected by local processes , such as heating due to star formation , and so caution is urged in interpreting these numbers .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that interactions with giant galaxies have had a negligible effect on their evolution .",
    "figure  8 shows the well - noted local group position - morphology relation , first highlighted by @xcite , in which the gas - deficient dsph galaxies are preferentially found in close proximity to either the mw or m31 .",
    "gas - rich dwarfs are preferentially located far from either of these two galaxies .",
    "similar behavior has been noted in other galaxy groupings ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , and this has long been interpreted as evidence of the importance of external effects , such as tidal or ram - pressure stripping , on the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "indeed , many simulations show that the combined effects of these processes are in principle sufficient to remove the gas from dirr - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , @xcite argue that dsph galaxies are too metal rich for their luminosity in comparison to the ( old ) stellar populations in dirr galaxies ;",
    "if so , then this requires that the early metallicity evolution of the two morphological types ( and not just their environments ) were also different .",
    "the visual appearance of dirr galaxies is usually very different from that of dsph systems , and reflects the presence of very young stellar populations and on - going star formation in the former .",
    "some dwarf galaxies are additionally classified as `` dirr / dsph '' : these so - called transition systems , such as ddo210 , distinguish themselves from dirrs primarily through the absence of _ current _ star formation ( formally , detectable hi but no detectable hii regions ) , despite having very young stellar populations . while star formation in some of these galaxies may have ceased permanently , in others it may be possible that low - level star formation is continuing without the production of hii regions ( @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "ongoing , low - level star formation may be interrupted by periods of inactivity ( `` gasping '' ; see @xcite for an example ) , in which case the distinction between a dirr and a transition system merely reflects the moment we happen to be observing it .",
    "the hst / angst survey ( @xcite ) has recently derived star formation histories ( sfhs ) for many nearby dwarf galaxies , including a large number of the more distant galaxies in this compilation .",
    "they show a tremendous diversity in the sfhs , and highlight that in a statistical sense there is essentially no difference between the sfhs of dirr galaxies and the transition systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "they suggest that many of the transition dwarfs are perhaps best treated as low mass dirr galaxies , and if any of the transition dwarfs are deserving of the moniker it is likely the less isolated , low gas fraction systems .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that the `` average '' sfhs of dirrs and dsphs in their sample are actually similar over most of cosmic time .",
    "it is only within the past few gyrs , and particularly within the past 1gyr , that the sfhs differ .",
    "however , the hst / angst survey generally samples only bright dsphs ( comparable in luminosity to fornax , for example ) , and low luminosity systems comparable to ursa minor , draco and their ilk are either absent or under - represented ( due to the difficulty of finding such galaxies outside of the local group ) .",
    "the reader is referred to the hst / lcid survey ( @xcite and references therein ) , that is presently investigating the possible connections between dirr , transition and dsph using isolated dwarfs within the local group .    a final distinction between dirr and dsph galaxies",
    "is traditionally made based on their kinematics , although this is not necessarily well motivated from an observational perspective , particularly at faint magnitudes .",
    "it is generally argued that dirr galaxies are rotationally supported systems , whereas dsph galaxies are pressure supported systems .",
    "however , as visible in table  4 , the majority of dynamical studies of dsph galaxies are based on resolved spectroscopy of individual ( giant ) stars . until recently , essentially",
    "all dynamical studies of local group dirr galaxies were based on hi , which generally shows significant rotation .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite has shown that the evolved rgb population in wlm has @xmath63 , whereas @xmath64 .",
    "thus while it may be true that the stellar component of dirrs show significant rotation compared to dsphs , caution should be exercised in comparing hi kinematics to those of evolved stellar populations .",
    "figure  9 plots the stellar velocity dispersion given in table  4 against the half - light radius for all galaxies for which this information exists . a broad correlation exists , such that colder systems have smaller scale - sizes , although the scatter in this relationship is roughly an order of magnitude at a given scale - radius .",
    "measuring some of these values is challenging : @xcite and @xcite both discuss the problems of determining structural parameters for galaxies in which few bright stars can be identified ( generally the case for galaxies much fainter than @xmath65 ) . for velocity dispersions , too , the lack of a large number of bright spectroscopic targets and the low expected dispersions make these measurements particularly challenging .",
    "typically , the velocity errors on individual stellar measurements that are used as a basis for deriving the overall dispersion are a few kms@xmath8 , which is of order the measured dispersion for some of the galaxies in figure  9 .",
    "one should also consider that the expected velocity dispersion of a faint system like segue , due only to its baryonic mass , is exceptionally small , at around @xmath66kms@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are a couple of primary sources of contamination when measuring velocity dispersions , all of which have been shown to bias the measured `` intrinsic '' dispersion of faint galaxies to higher values .",
    "foreground contamination can have a significant effect .",
    "the first measurement of the velocity dispersion of the hercules dwarf gave @xmath67kms@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite obtained stromgren photometry for stars in the direction of hercules and were able to separate member stars from interloping dwarf stars in the halo of the galaxy . without doing this separation , @xcite measure a value of @xmath68kms@xmath8 ( in broad with @xcite ) .",
    "by additionally being able to reject foreground dwarfs , they find a considerably lower value of @xmath69kms@xmath8 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "binary stars are a further source of known contamination when measuring the velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies , where the reflex motion of an unresolved binary star is mistaken as a component of the intrinsic dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "this potential source of contamination was originally investigated prior to the identification of extremely faint dwarf galaxies to determine if it could inflate the measured velocity dispersion sufficiently to incorrectly infer the need for non - baryonic mass - to - light ratios .",
    "numerous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) all concluded that , barring a pathological or extremely high binary population , binary stars were insufficient to boost a stellar system with @xmath70kms@xmath8 to @xmath71kms@xmath8 , although some inflation of the dispersion is to be expected . @xcite have developed a methodology to statistically correct the velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies for this binary inflation ; their own study indicates that systems with intrinsic dispersions of @xmath72kms@xmath8 are unlikely to have their dispersion inflated by more than 20% as a result of binaries .",
    "for systems with lower intrinsic dispersions than this , @xcite argue that the inflation effect due to binaries could be significant , although this depends on the as - yet - unmeasured stellar binary fraction(s ) in dwarf galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite develop a procedure for obtaining accurate radial velocities with demonstrably reliable uncertainties at faint magnitudes and conduct a multi - epoch spectroscopic study of the bootes dwarf galaxy .",
    "approximately 10% of the stars in their sample show evidence for velocity variability .",
    "their data favor a two component model for bootes ( see discussion in  4 ) , where the central , dominant component has a velocity dispersion of @xmath73kms@xmath8 .",
    "their preferred value is notably lower than earlier values of order @xmath74kms@xmath8 reported by @xcite and @xcite ( although they are in statistical agreement ) .",
    "these results all emphasize the difficulties in obtaining reliable estimates of the intrinsic velocity dispersions of very faint dwarf galaxies : reliable ( and small ! ) velocity uncertainties , multi - epoch data and dwarf - giant separation are all essential components to any successful measurement .    with the above caveats on the basic dynamical data , figure  10 shows the dynamical mass estimates for each dwarf galaxy within its half - light radius , as a function of absolute visual magnitude .",
    "here , i have used the formalism by @xcite ; @xcite justify in detail why the mass within the half - light radius is in general able to be reliably measured for dispersion - supported spheroids .",
    "the left panel highlights by name each galaxy for which the necessary data exist , whereas the right panel shows the formal uncertainties on propagating the quoted uncertainties on @xmath75 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that these estimates do not take into consideration errors introduced as a result of the dynamical state of the galaxy .",
    "for example , a few galaxies in figure  10 show some rotation in addition to dispersion support ( m32 , ngc205 , ngc147 , ngc185 , cetus , wlm ) and other galaxies may or may not be in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "further , the walker et al .",
    "formalism assumes that the velocity dispersion profile is flat with radius ( the wolf et al .",
    "formalism adopts a luminosity - weighted mean velocity dispersion ) ; however , for many galaxies shown in figure  10 the form of the radial velocity dispersion profile is unknown .",
    "a full study of the dynamics of these galaxies is clearly outside the scope of this article , and the current estimates are provided solely to demonstrate the status of the observational data in terms of its basic implications regarding the mass content of the galaxies .",
    "figure  11 shows the same data as figure  10 , except i have now normalised @xmath76 by @xmath77 to estimate the implied mass - to - light ratio of each system within its half - light radius .",
    "figures  10 and 11 demonstrate that there appears to be a well defined relation consistent with a power law between @xmath78 and @xmath45 that holds across a factor of nearly 1 million in luminosity , in agreement with the finding reported by @xcite . as discussed above , systematic errors in the measurements of the relevant quantities , and the necessary assumptions that must be made in converting these quantities to a mass estimate , mean the precise position of any single point in these plots is open to considerable debate .",
    "further , it should be stressed that observational selection effects such as that discussed for figure  6 ( which may be responsible for the precise form of the @xmath52 at low luminosities ) will also affect these figures due to the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath44 .",
    "measurements such as those on which figures  10 and 11 are based have also been used to argue for a common mass - scale for the ( milky way ) dwarfs ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "this is usually made with reference to the mass enclosed with an absolute radial scale ( typically @xmath79pc ) , a quantity that is used because of its usefulness in dark - matter only simulations , where there is no information regarding the size of the baryonic components of galaxies .",
    "however , given that the half - light radii of the dwarfs in and around the local group have @xmath80pc , then from an observational perspective this is a far less well - defined quantity than @xmath78 .",
    "table  5 lists the available data for the mean stellar metallicities , @xmath81>$ ] , of the galaxies :    * column 1 : galaxy name ; * column 2 : mean stellar metallicity and error , generally derived from observations of mostly evolved giants , else commented on in column 5 .",
    "note that i quote the _",
    "mean _ metallicity of all stars ( as opposed to the median , mode , etc . ) in the observed metallicity distribution function , and so this will be susceptible to any uncorrected biases in the observed sample . the mean stellar metallicity refers to the mean iron - peak metallicity expressed in logarithmic notation relative to the solar value ; * column 3 : technique used to estimate stellar metallicity .",
    "a discussion is given below ; * column 4 : references ; * column 5 : comments .",
    "figure  12 shows mean stellar metallicity as a function of absolute visual magnitude , where by definition both axes are logarithmic quantities . in the left panel ,",
    "all tabulated data from table  5 are given , whereas in the right panel only data that use spectroscopically - determined quantities are shown .",
    "generally the most well - accepted method of determining [ fe / h ] for a given star is from direct high resolution spectroscopy ( hrs ) from which the strengths of iron lines can be measured directly .",
    "however , table  5 lists estimates for @xmath81>$ ] that stem from a variety of additional techniques :    * rgb color : @xcite derive a relation between the mean color of rgb stars in globular clusters measured at @xmath82 and the mean stellar metallicity of the cluster . a refined calibration ( derived at @xmath83 ) using the same data",
    "was presented by @xcite , and this has been used throughout the literature as a convenient means of estimating the mean stellar metallicity of a system when only photometry of bright stars is available .",
    "an obvious disadvantage , of course , is that it is calibrated on ancient stellar populations .",
    "since rgb stars are subject to age and metallicity degeneracies then this technique may not be reliable if significantly younger stars are present .",
    "i note that in table  5 and figure  12 most of the non - local group galaxies have their mean stellar metallicity determined in this way .",
    "there is a suggestion in figure  12 that these estimates are low in comparison to local group galaxies with similar absolute visual magnitudes , but its cause or significance is difficult to determine ; * isochrones : the comparison of theoretical isochrones , evolutionary tracks , or globular cluster fiducials , to the cmds of galaxies is usually heavily or entirely weighted towards the color of the rgb , and so is in principle subject to the same systematic uncertainties regarding ages as discussed above .",
    "in addition , isochrones produced by different groups may have some systematic differences between the predicted rgb colors at any age . however ,",
    "one potential advantage of isochrones over empirical rgb color relations is that , if additional information is available regarding ages ( e.g. , from the red clump or main sequence turn - off ) , then isochrones with appropriate ages can be used ; * cmd fitting : the reader is referred to the many excellent papers on sfh analysis using resolved stellar populations for more details ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . here ,",
    "age degeneracies will likely be much reduced since age information is available from elsewhere in the cmd ( in particular the main - sequence turn - off region ) ; * calcium ii triplet equivalent widths ( low , moderate resolution spectroscopy ) : the strengths of the three cat absorption lines at @xmath84 and @xmath85in rgb stars have been shown to correlate with [ fe / h ] if the temperature and surface gravity of the star is able to be estimated through measurement of its absolute magnitude . the cat is a relatively strong feature and consequently it can be relatively easily measured using low - to - moderate resolution spectroscopy ( l / mrs ) .",
    "many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have developed calibrations between cat equivalent width and [ fe / h ] , most recently @xcite .",
    "these authors also examine the form of the correlation at [ fe / h ] @xmath86 . using the new calibration , @xcite",
    "demonstrate that the resulting estimates of [ fe / h ] match those derived from hrs down to a limiting stellar metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath87 .",
    "many of the values listed in table  5 use the earlier calibrations , which can potentially deviate from the new calibration for stellar metallicities lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath88 , depending upon the absolute magnitudes of the observed stars ; * spectral synthesis ( moderate resolution spectroscopy ) : here , synthetic spectra spanning a range of key parameters ( e.g. , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath89fe ] , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) are compared to the measured stellar spectrum to determine the most likely [ fe / h ] . @xcite",
    "have developed this technique for specific use on the dwarf galaxies of the mw with considerable success . here , the main advantages are that one uses more spectral information than relying only on specific indices . since one uses moderate resolutions , fainter targets can be studied than is possible with hrs .",
    "clearly , the range of techniques from which @xmath81>$ ] has been derived in table  5 may produce numerous systematic differences between results .",
    "recent discussions of some of these issues can be found in @xcite ( spectral synthesis ) , @xcite ( cat ) and @xcite ( isochrones , cat ) and the reader is referred to these papers for more details .",
    "i note that several of the @xmath81>$ ] values listed in table  5 only quote the uncertainty from the random error in the mean ( i.e. , @xmath92}}{\\sqrt{n}}$ ] ) and do not include the additional systematic uncertainties ( which can not be treated in the same way ) .",
    "for galaxies for which this is the case , an additional systematic error component must be included , typically a tenth of a dex or more .",
    "in addition to the systematic uncertainties introduced by the measurement technique , an additional systematic effect enters the calculation of the mean stellar metallicities in table  5 through the spatial extent of the stars contributing to the measurement .",
    "dwarf galaxies are known to exhibit radial gradients in stellar populations , ages and/or metallicity distributions ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus far , all observed metallicity gradients are such that a higher `` mean '' stellar metallicity is observed in the central regions of the dwarf than in the outer regions .",
    "two galaxies with identical metallicity distribution functions and radial gradients will therefore be measured to have different `` mean '' stellar metallicities if there is any difference in the radial distribution of stars that contribute to the measurement . given the range in radial scale associated with the galaxies in table  5 , and the unknown spatial structure of the stellar populations / ages / metallicities within many of these systems , this effect may be significant .    with the above caveats , both panels of figure  12 show the well - known luminosity ",
    "mean stellar metallicity relation , whereby more luminous galaxies are generally more metal - rich in the mean than faint galaxies ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . the relation is better defined in the right panel , which uses only spectroscopic measurements of @xmath81>$ ] ; the degree to which the scatter in the left panel is a result of systematic errors ( age effects , measurement techniques , etc . )",
    "is unknown . as pointed out by @xcite , the luminosity",
    " mean stellar metallicity relation at faint magnitudes ( @xmath93 ) is entirely consistent with a continuation of the trend displayed for bright galaxies .",
    "however , it is also worth highlighting the dearth of data at faint magnitudes : if only galaxies fainter than @xmath94 are considered , then the data are equally consistent with a scatter around a floor in mean stellar metallicity at @xmath81>$ ] @xmath95 .",
    "while more data are certainly needed , it is interesting to note that the magnitude at which one can start arguing for a floor in mean stellar metallicity is broadly the same point at which there is a break in the absolute magnitude  surface - brightness relation shown in figure  7 ( discussed in  4 ) . while certainly speculative , this may suggest a direct link between the surface brightness of a galaxy ( specifically , the _ density _ of baryons , rather than the total amount of baryons ) and its mean stellar metallicity ( see theoretical work by @xcite , @xcite and references therein ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "many more parameters are required in order to fully define the metallicity distribution function of stars in any of the dwarf galaxies , and the reader is referred to @xcite for a more complete discussion of ongoing observational efforts in this regard . as discussed in @xcite , detailed chemistry , such as abundance ratios of key elements",
    ", are now available for the nearest galaxies , with much more to come . in the near future",
    ", the combination of dynamical data with detailed information on the chemical evolution of galaxies is likely to continue to be a significant area of discovery and advance .",
    "tables  1  5 provide observational parameters for approximately 100 nearby dwarf galaxies , including positional data , radial velocities , photometric and structural parameters , stellar , hi and dynamical masses , internal kinematics ( dispersions and rotation ) , and mean stellar metallicities .",
    "in addition to discussing the provenance of the values and possible sources of uncertainties affecting their usage , i also consider the membership and ( limited ? ) spatial extent of the mw and m31 sub - groups ; the morphological diversity of the m31 sub - group in comparison to the mw ; the location of the zero - velocity surface of the local group ; the time - scales that can be associated with the orbital / interaction histories of the local group members ; the scaling relations defined by the sample , including their behavior at the faintest magnitudes / surface brightnesses ; the luminosity  mean stellar metallicity relation , including its possible connection to the central surface brightness of the galaxies .",
    "the dwarf galaxies discussed herein constitute all known satellite systems in the surrounding of the mw and m31 , all quasi - isolated systems in the more distant reaches of the local group , and all other , generally very isolated , dwarf galaxies that surround the local group out to 3mpc , beyond which most of the known galaxies are members of maffei , sculptor , canes venatici , ic342 , m81 and the many other groups in the local volume found out to the virgo cluster and beyond . in some respects , these systems are stepping stones into the local volume , and we are fortunate that they present us with a large and diverse range of properties to explore . this article has purposefully focused entirely on observable , quantifiable properties of these galaxies , and it is right that the published tables likely already contain obsolete numbers or do not include the most recent discoveries .",
    "our knowledge of many of these systems far exceeds that of other galaxies , and we will continue to be able to obtain ever more detailed observations of aspects of their structure , dynamics , stellar populations and chemical signatures that are beyond the reach of observational programs of more distant galaxies . in the future as now , these are the galaxies for which we will know the most , and so are perhaps destined to understand the least .",
    "updated versions of the core data available in tables 1  5 for all dwarf galaxies within 3mpc are available at https://www.astrosci.ca/users/alan/nearby_dwarfs_database.html .",
    "i thank peter stetson , matthew walker , daniel weisz , sidney van den bergh and else starkenburg for careful readings of the manuscript and valuable comments ; ryan leaman for his feedback , and for stressing the importance of radial metallicity gradients when considering mean stellar metallicities , which led to the addition of the relevant paragraph ; josh simon for highlighting relevant references .",

    "<S> positional , structural and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the local group are presented , and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume - limited sample are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3mpc of the sun are identified . </S>",
    "<S> this distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments , from the satellite systems of the mw and m31 , to the quasi - isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the local group , to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> it extends to , but does not include , the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups , such as maffei , sculptor , and ic342 . our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities , and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> basic observational parameters , such as distances , velocities , magnitudes , mean metallicities , as well as structural and dynamical characteristics , are collated , homogenized ( as far as possible ) , and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current on - line resource . as well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage , the membership and spatial extent of the mw sub - group , m31 sub - group and the local group are explored . </S>",
    "<S> the morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub - groups is discussed , and time - scales are derived for the local group members in the context of their orbital / interaction histories . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented , and the origin of a possible `` floor '' in central surface brightness ( and , more speculatively , stellar mean metallicity ) at faint magnitudes is considered . </S>"
