    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations can be powerful tools to gain insights into relevant physical processes in highly supercooled liquids . in particular , a number of recent md simulations have detected dynamic heterogeneities in supercooled model binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "that is , rearrangements of particle configurations in glassy states are cooperative , involving many molecules , owing to configuration restrictions .",
    "recently , we succeeded in quantitatively characterizing the dynamic heterogeneities in two ( 2d ) and three dimensional ( 3d ) model fluids via md simulations .",
    "we examined bond breakage processes among adjacent particle pairs and found that the broken bonds in an appropriate time interval ( @xmath6 the stress relaxation time or the structural @xmath7 relaxation time @xmath8 ) are very analogous to the critical fluctuations in ising spin systems with their structure factor being excellently fitted to the ornstein - zernike form @xcite .",
    "the correlation length @xmath9 thus obtained is related to @xmath8 via the dynamic scaling law , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 in 2d and @xmath12 in 3d .",
    "the heterogeneity structure in the bond breakage is essentially the same as that in jump motions of particles from cages or that in the local diffusivity , as will be discussed below . in this paper",
    ", we investigate heterogeneities of tagged particle motions in a 3d supercooled liquid @xcite .    in a wide range of liquid states",
    ", the stokes - einstein relation @xmath13 has been successfully applied between the translational diffusion constant @xmath14 of a tagged particle and the viscosity @xmath15 even when the tagged particle diameter @xmath16 is of the same order as that of solvent molecules . however , this relation is systematically violated in fragile supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the diffusion process in supercooled liquids is thus not well understood .",
    "in particular , sillescu _",
    "_ observed the power law behavior @xmath17 with @xmath18 at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ediger _",
    "_ found that smaller probe particles exhibit a more pronounced increase of @xmath19 with decreasing @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the stokes - einstein diffusion constant .",
    "in such experiments the viscosity changes over 12 decades with decreasing @xmath20 , while the ratio @xmath22 increases from order 1 up to order @xmath23 .",
    "the same tendency has been detected by molecular dynamics simulations in a 3d binary mixture with @xmath24 particles @xcite and in a 2d binary mixture with @xmath25 @xcite . in our recent 3d simulation with @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath15 and @xmath14",
    "both varied over 4 decades and the power law behavior @xmath27 has been observed .",
    "many authors have attributed the origin of the breakdown to heterogeneous coexistence of relatively active and inactive regions , among which the local diffusion constant is expected to vary significantly @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate via md simulation that the diffusivity of the particles is indeed heterogeneous on time scales shorter than @xmath8 but becomes homogeneous on time scales much longer than @xmath8 .",
    "our 3d binary mixture is composed of two atomic species , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 particles with the system linear dimension @xmath31 being fixed at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "they interact via the soft - core potentials @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where @xmath1 is the distance between two particles and @xmath35 .",

    "no tendency of phase separation is detected at least in our computation times .",
    "we fix the particle density at a very high value of @xmath39 , so the particle configurations are severely restricted or jammed . we will measure space and time in units of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature @xmath20 will be measured in units of @xmath42 , and the viscosity @xmath15 in units of @xmath43 .",
    "the time step @xmath44 is used . in our systems",
    "the structural relaxation time becomes very long at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , very long annealing times ( @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) are chosen in our case . for @xmath47 ,",
    "no appreciable aging ( slow equilibration ) effect is detected in various quantities such as the pressure or the density time correlation function , whereas at @xmath48 , a small aging effect remains in the density time correlation function .",
    "let us first consider the incoherent density correlation function , @xmath49}}\\rangle}/n_1 $ ] for the particle species 1 , where @xmath50 is the displacement vector of the @xmath51-th particle .",
    "the @xmath7 relaxation time @xmath8 is then defined by @xmath52 at @xmath53 for various @xmath20 .",
    "we also calculate the coherent time correlation function , @xmath54 , where @xmath55}$ ] is the fourier component of the density fluctuations of the particle species 1 .",
    "the decay profiles of @xmath56 at its first peak wave number @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 nearly coincide in the whole time region studied ( @xmath60 ) within @xmath61 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . hence @xmath62 holds for any @xmath20 in our simulation .",
    "such agreement is not obtained for other wave numbers , however .",
    "these results are consistent with those for a lennard - jones binary mixture @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some neutron - spin - echo experiments @xcite showed that the decay time of @xmath63 is nearly equal to the stress relaxation time and as a result the viscosity @xmath15 is of order @xmath8 . in agreement with this experimental result",

    "however , notice that the usual diffusion constant is the long wavelength limit , @xmath71 .",
    "it is usually calculated from the mean square displacement , @xmath72 the crossover of this quantity from the plateau behavior arising from motions in transient cages to the diffusion behavior @xmath73 has been found to take place around @xmath74 @xcite . in fig.2 , we plot @xmath75 versus @xmath8 , which clearly indicates breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation in agreement with the experimental trend .    to examine the diffusion process in more detail , we consider the van hove self - correlation function , @xmath76 then , f_s(q , t ) = _",
    "0^dr 4r^2 g_s(r , t ) [ eq:2 ] is the 3d fourier transformation of @xmath77 . at the peak wavenumber @xmath59 , the integrand in eq.(2 )",
    "vanishes at @xmath78 , and the integral in the region @xmath79 is confirmed to dominantly determine the decay of @xmath80 . on the other hand , the mean square displacement = _ 0^dr 4r^4 g_s(r , t ) [ eq:3 ] is determined by the particle motions out of the cages for @xmath81 in glassy states . in fig.3",
    ", we display @xmath82 versus @xmath1 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "these curves may be compared with the gaussian ( brownian motion ) result , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the stokes - einstein mean square displacement .",
    "because the areas below the curves give @xmath89 , we recognize that the particle motions over large distances @xmath90 are much enhanced at low @xmath20 , leading to the violation of the stokes - einstein relation .",

    "the gaussian results is @xmath106 .",
    "the ratio of the second moments @xmath107 is held fixed at @xmath108 , while the ratio of the fourth moments @xmath109 turns out to be close to 1 as @xmath110 in ( a ) , @xmath111 in ( b ) , and @xmath112 in ( c ) .",
    "the mobile particles are homogeneously distributed for @xmath85 at @xmath8 , whereas for @xmath46 , the heterogeneity is significant at @xmath8 , but is much decreased at @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , the variance defined by @xmath114 is @xmath115 in ( a ) , @xmath116 in ( b ) , and @xmath117 in ( c ) .",
    "note that the statistical average of @xmath118 ( taken over many initial times @xmath119 ) is related to the non - gaussian parameter @xmath120 by ( 5 /3c_2 ^ 2 n_1 ) ( 1 + a_2(t ) ) - 1 , where the deviations @xmath121 and @xmath122 are confirmed to be very small for large @xmath123 and are thus neglected .",
    "we may also conclude that the significant rise of @xmath124 in glassy states originates from the heterogeneity in accord with some experimental interpretations @xcite .",
    "we next consider the fourier component of the _ diffusivity _ density defined by _",
    "q(t_0 , t ) _",

    "the correlation function @xmath126 is then obtained after averaging over many initial states .",
    "we plot @xmath127 in fig . 5 ( a ) . the heterogeneity structure @xmath128 of the bond breakage @xcite with a time interval of @xmath8",
    "is also plotted in fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "it is confirmed that @xmath129 tends to its long wavelength limit for @xmath130 , where @xmath9 coincides with the correlation length obtained from @xmath131 . as the difference @xmath132 of the initial times increases with fixed @xmath133 , @xmath134 relaxes as",
    "@xmath135 $ ] for @xmath130 , where @xmath136 at @xmath46 and @xmath137 is the life time of the heterogeneity structure .",
    "the two - time correlation function among the broken bond density @xcite also relaxes with @xmath138 in the same manner .",
    "we naturally expect that the distribution of the particle displacement @xmath139 in the active regions should be characterized by the local diffusion constant @xmath140 dependent on the spatial position @xmath141 and the time interval @xmath142 .",
    "the van hove correlation function @xmath0 may then be expressed as the spatial average of a local function @xmath143 , which is given by @xmath144^{-3/2}\\exp [ -{r^2}/4d({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}}},t)t ] $ ] . to check this conjecture",
    ", we plot the scaled function @xmath145 versus @xmath146 in fig .",
    "the areas below the curves are fixed at 1 . at relatively short times",
    "@xmath147 , the curves in the region @xmath148 or @xmath149 , which give dominant contributions to @xmath150 , tend to a master curve quite different from the rapidly decaying gaussian tail .",
    "note that in each curve the position of the peak at larger @xmath151 corresponds to @xmath152 .",
    "this asymptotic law is consistent with the picture of the space - dependent diffusion constant in the active regions .",
    "it is also important that the heterogeneity structure remains unchanged in the time region @xmath153 . at longer times",
    "@xmath154 , the curves approach the gaussian form as can be seen in the inset of fig.5 . of course ,",
    "@xmath155 for @xmath79 does not scale in the above manner , because it is the probability density of a tagged particle staying within a cage .",
    "this short - range behavior determines the decay of @xmath80 as noted below eq.(2 ) .",
    "in our previous studies @xcite , we performed extensive md simulations and identified _ weakly bonded _ or _ relatively active _ regions from breakage of appropriately defined bonds .",
    "we also found that the spatial distributions of such regions resemble the critical fluctuations in ising spin systems , so the correlation length @xmath9 can be determined .",
    "it grows up to the system size as @xmath20 is lowered , but no divergence seems to exist at nonzero temperatures . in the present work , we have demonstrated that the diffusivity in supercooled liquids is spatially heterogeneous on time scales shorter than @xmath156 , which leads to the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation @xcite .",
    "the heterogeneity detected is essentially the same as that of the bond breakage in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we should then investigate how the heterogeneity arises and influences observable quantities in more realistic glass - forming fluids with complex structures .",
