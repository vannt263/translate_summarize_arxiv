    "nonlocality is a basic property of quantum states not available in classical world , and it has been the research interest for many years @xcite . the nonlocality can be studied in the context of bell - type inequalities @xcite , it can also be investigated from other viewpoints , for example , from an information - theoretic perspective @xcite . on the other hand , the nonlocality is closely related with entanglement which plays a central role in quantum information processing @xcite , but they are not completely the same .",
    "there are a series of work concentrated on revealing the relationship between nonlocality and entanglement , for example , it is shown that while there are entangled states without bell nonlocality @xcite , there also exists nonlocality without entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that entanglement is a resource in quantum protocols and algorithms @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent progress shows that the separable but nonclassical states may be responsible for the speedup of a quantum algorithm @xcite .",
    "it ignites interests of people on studying , from various points of view , the quantumness of correlations @xcite and their relations with entanglement and nonlocality @xcite .",
    "particularly , luo and fu @xcite introduced a geometric measure of nonlocality which they termed measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) . in comparison with bell nonlocality",
    "which is featured by violation of bell - type inequalities satisfied by any local hidden variable theory @xcite , the min is in some sense a more general kind of correlation which was introduced from the consideration that measurements in quantum mechanics usually causes disturbance .",
    "the extent of the maximum disturbance of locally non - disturbing measurements on the total state can reveal global effect of that state which can not be accounted for locally and therefore can be exploited to quantify nonlocality .",
    "the min provides an interesting classification scheme for the bipartite quantum states . in the original geometric quantification scheme @xcite ,",
    "it is obtained by maximizing the hilbert - schmidt distance between the pre- and post - measurement states . for completeness of theoretical consideration , it is also desirable to quantify it from other perspectives so as to reveal more about its meaning and properties .",
    "this is one of our motivations in this paper .",
    "moreover , we know that entanglement is fragile due to decoherence induced by inevitable interaction between the system and its environment . while the min can also be a powerful resource enabling fascinating quantum tasks as shown in @xcite , it is of practical significance to know the property of min , for example , to find ways to stabilize the min of a state or to minimize the devastating effects of the decohering environments .",
    "this is also a motivation of this work .    in this paper , we introduce the entropic measure of min , which is different from the corresponding geometric measure @xcite , and give an information - theoretic interpretation of it .",
    "we will obtain the conditions for nonvanishing min , and show that there is nonlocality without quantumness in the sense that the min may persist even for certain zero - discord states .",
    "we will also offer a comparative study of the relationships between min and different quantum correlation measures @xcite for the two - qubit case .",
    "we will show that when interacting with the structured reservoirs , the min can be frozen by introducing detuning or by performing local unitary operations on the initial state , particularly , the strength of min can even be enhanced by interacting the system with a common reservoir .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we first recall the concept of min and its quantification based on the hilbert - schmidt norm @xcite .",
    "then we reformulate the min from an entropic way and list some general features of it . in section iii",
    ", we evaluate dynamics of min for a certain family of two - qubit states both in the independent and common reservoirs , and present schemes for preserving and enhancing the min .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to a summary .",
    "the preform of min was first introduced by luo and fu @xcite and further formulated by the same authors @xcite .",
    "consider a bipartite state @xmath0 shared by two parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with marginal states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , then the min is defined as follows @xmath5 where the maximum is taken over the local von neumann measurements @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the hilbert - schmidt norm with @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , @xmath10 contains in fact only the measurements that do not disturb @xmath3 locally , thus as pointed out in @xcite , the min is _ in some sense dual to _ the geometric measure of quantum discord ( gmqd ) @xcite @xmath11 , with @xmath10 runs over all the local von neumann measurements .    by noting that any @xmath12 bipartite state @xmath0 can always be represented as @xmath13 luo and fu derived an analytical formula of min for the @xmath14 dimensional states , which is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are traceless hermitian operators satisfying the conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 is the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath21 with @xmath22 being a real @xmath23 matrix with elements @xmath24 , and @xmath25 with @xmath26 . here",
    "the superscript @xmath27 denotes transpose of vectors or matrices .",
    "although the definitions of min and gmqd are different , they may assume equal values under certain circumstances . to see this ,",
    "consider the two - qubit x state @xmath28 ( i.e. , the @xmath29 density matrix with nonzero elements only along the main diagonal and anti - diagonal ) , for which one can obtain @xmath30 and the eigenvalues of @xmath21 as @xmath31    moreover , it has been shown by daki _",
    "_ @xcite that for the two - qubit quantum states the gmqd can be presented explicitly as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath34 . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath35 can be obtained analytically as @xmath36    eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 7 ) imply that @xmath37 , so for nondegenerate @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) we have @xmath40 when @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the eigenvector of @xmath35 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath42 is @xmath43 , hence the optimal measurement for obtaining the gmqd is @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath38 is nondegenerate , then the unique von neumann measurement leaving @xmath38 invariant is @xmath45 @xcite . the optimal measurements for obtaining the min and gmqd are completely the same ,",
    "thus it is understandable that they assume equal values under the condition @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , it is direct to check that @xmath46 , thus if @xmath38 is degenerate with the addition of @xmath41 and @xmath47 , we still have @xmath40 .    besides the hilbert - schmidt norm which measures the min from a geometric perspective @xcite , it is also desirable to quantify it from other perspectives . in particular ,",
    "if we accept that the quantum mutual information ( qmi ) is a good measure of total correlations in a bipartite state @xmath0 , then it is natural to quantify min by the maximal discrepancy between the qmi of the pre- and post - measurement states as @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 represents the qmi , and the minimum is taken only over the local von neumann measurements leaving @xmath3 invariant .",
    "this measure of min quantifies in fact , the maximal loss of total correlations under locally invariant ( non - disturbing ) measurements .",
    "since @xmath50=s(\\rho^b)-s(\\rho|\\{\\pi_k^a\\})$ ] @xcite represents the average information gained about the system @xmath2 conditioned on the measurements @xmath51 , @xmath52 is in some sense dual to the quantum discord ( qd ) @xmath53 $ ] @xcite .",
    "but the maximum in @xmath54 runs over _ all _ the local von neumann measurements .",
    "moreover , the measure of min introduced here is also quite different from the quantity @xmath55 $ ] , which was introduced by luo @xcite and has been termed measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) , because when defining @xmath56 the locally invariant measurements @xmath57 are performed on both parties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the projective measurement @xmath10 leaves @xmath3 invariant ( @xmath4 is obviously also invariant ) , @xmath52 defined above is equivalent to @xmath58-s(\\rho),\\ ] ] from which one can obtain @xmath59 because _ projective measurements always increase entropy _ ( theorem 11.9 of @xcite ) .",
    "( 9 ) also indicates that @xmath52 quantifies in fact the maximal increment of von neumann entropy induced by the locally invariant measurements .",
    "this result thus establishes a connection between increment of entropy and nonlocality in the quantum domain .",
    "moreover , from an information - theoretic perspective , the entropy measures how much uncertainty there is in the state of a physical system @xcite , @xmath60 can therefore also be interpreted as the maximal increment of our uncertainty about that system induced by the locally invariant measurements .",
    "the post - measurement state can always be written as @xmath61 @xcite , combination of this with the _ joint entropy theorem _",
    "@xcite gives rise to @xmath62=h(p_i)+\\sum_i p_i s(\\rho^b_i)$ ] , where @xmath63 represents the shannon entropy .",
    "furthermore , from theorem 11.10 of @xcite one can obtain @xmath64 , and from @xcite we have @xmath65 , thus @xmath52 is lower bounded by @xmath66 and upper bounded by @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the conditional von neumann entropy for @xmath0 , and @xmath69 gives the lower bound of the one - way distillable entanglement . but both the lower and the upper bounds are non - trivial only when @xmath70 because we always have @xmath59 and @xmath71 .",
    "for the two - qubit x states @xmath28 with nondegenerate @xmath38 , the only von neumann measurement leaving @xmath38 invariant is @xmath72 with @xmath73 , which gives rise to the post - measurement state as @xmath74 .",
    "still for @xmath28 with nondegenerate @xmath38 one can check directly that @xmath75 .",
    "thus for the special circumstance considered here we always have @xmath76 .",
    "but if @xmath38 is degenerate , then @xmath77 in general .    now we discuss conditions under which the min disappears .",
    "first , it is clear that the min is strictly positive for any state @xmath0 with non - vanishing quantum correlations .",
    "this can be shown directly from the definitions of min and qd based on the hilbert - schmidt distance or the discrepancy between qmi of the pre- and post - measurement states , for which we always have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus one only need to consider the classical - quantum state @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "if the reduced state @xmath81 is nondegenerate ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , then the min disappears because for this case the only von neumann measurement leaving @xmath83 invariant is @xmath84 , which yields @xmath85 and thus there is no min @xcite .",
    "if @xmath83 is degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) , then we need to consider two different cases .",
    "the first one is that @xmath87 for all @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for this case",
    ", we always have @xmath90 and there is still no min .",
    "second , if @xmath91 , then one can always find a complete projective measurement @xmath92 so that @xmath93 , thus from theorem 11.9 of @xcite we obtain @xmath94>s(\\rho_{\\rm cq})$ ] , which gives rise to non - vanishing min . since there is no quantum correlations in @xmath95",
    ", the result obtained here reveals that there exists not only nonlocality without entanglement but also nonlocality without quantumness .    as an example",
    ", we consider the two - qubit @xmath95 with degenerate @xmath83 ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath98 and @xmath99 versus @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "it is evident that the min vanishes only when @xmath103 , that is @xmath104 , which corroborates our above statements .",
    "also one can note that when @xmath105 , @xmath106 or @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath98 assumes the value 0.25 , half of the maximum 0.5 obtained for the maximally entangled bell states @xmath109 .",
    "but @xmath99 assumes its maximum 1 under the same conditions , equals completely to those obtained for @xmath109 .",
    "this is because @xmath110 , and for this two special cases one can always choose corresponding complete projective measurements @xmath111 so that @xmath112 and @xmath94=2 $ ] .",
    "in fact , the classical correlation in @xmath95 is completely destroyed by the projective measurement @xmath10 because @xmath113=0 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath109 , however , the classical correlation is undisturbed because the optimal measurement @xmath10 ( may be different from that for @xmath95 ) for obtaining the min gives @xmath114=1 $ ] , equals to the classical correlation present in @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that for @xmath95 with non - vanishing min , the classical correlation is partially destroyed by the optimal measurement @xmath10 .",
    "the above discussions also indicate that the different measures of min may impose different orderings of quantum states , and in particular , the maximum @xmath115 does not always indicates that the state @xmath0 is maximally entangled , which is in sharp contrast to that of min measured by @xmath116 or quantum correlations measured by qd , gmqd and mid @xcite .",
    "* a. the model *    we consider a system consists of two identical atoms with lower and upper levels denoted by @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and is coupled to two typical structured reservoirs , i.e. , the independent and common zero - temperature bosonic reservoir @xcite . for the former case ,",
    "the two atoms interact with their own reservoir with @xmath119 , and the single `` qubit+reservoir '' hamiltonian reads @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the transition frequency of the atoms , and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) are the pauli rasing and lowering operators .",

    "2 we plotted @xmath52 versus @xmath176 and @xmath177 with the two atoms prepared in different initial states and coupled resonantly ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) to the reservoirs .",
    "it is clear that they attain certain maxima at @xmath179 and vanish at @xmath180 or @xmath181 . for fixed @xmath176",
    ", min decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath177 for the markovian reservoir [ see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] , while there are revivals of min for the non - markovian reservoir [ see figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) ] .",
    "since there are neither direct nor reservoir - mediated interactions between the two atoms , the revivals of min after a certain minimum may be induced by the non - markovian effects .    if the two atoms interact with the common reservoir , however , @xmath173 and @xmath174 will exhibit completely different min dynamics .",
    "particularly , for the initial sub - radiant state @xmath182 , the density matrix maintains its initial value ( i.e. , latexmath:[$\\rho(t)\\equiv    decay . to see more about min dynamics for this case , we show in fig .",
    "3 the @xmath52 versus @xmath176 and @xmath177 with different initial states . one can note that the min displays complicated behaviors .",
    "first , it is not a symmetric quantity with respect to @xmath179 for the initial state @xmath184 , and @xmath52 can even does not behave as a monotonic function of @xmath177 for the markovian reservoir . as one can see from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , there are creations of min for the initial state @xmath184 with @xmath180 and for @xmath170 with @xmath180 or @xmath181 .",
    "the underlying reason for this is the reservoir - mediated interaction because here the two atoms interact with a common reservoir .",
    "second , there are still revivals of min for the non - markovian case , but the combined effects of the non - markovian effects and the reservoir - mediated interaction makes it more evident than those for the independent reservoirs .",
    "when the two atoms interact with independent reservoirs , their entanglement may be trapped by detuning the central frequency of the reservoir from @xmath121 @xcite . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we display @xmath52 versus @xmath177 for the initial state @xmath185 with various values of detuning @xmath141 .",
    "the result shows that @xmath52 may be enhanced by introducing detuning @xmath141 and when @xmath186 it begins to oscillating weakly around its initial value , from which it is reasonable to conjecture that up to the large detuning limit case @xmath52 will maintains its initial value during the time evolution process and thus min trapping occurs .",
    "experimentally , for two rb rydberg atoms with lifetime @xmath187 and inside the fabry - prot superconducting resonant cavities with quality factor @xmath188 , we have the atomic decay rate @xmath189 , and the spectral width of the reservoir @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "these values correspond to a good non - markovian regime .",
    "moreover , the detuning needed to freeze the min can be implemented by stark - shifting the transition frequencies with a static electric field .",
    "the typical stark shifts are @xmath191 @xcite and thus a dimensionless shift with respect to @xmath135 of the order @xmath192 can be realized .",
    "since the reservoir always acts in some basis and therefore changing the basis may change the strength of reservoir and thus affect the durability of correlations .",
    "particularly , when the two identical atoms equally coupled to the common reservoir , there exists a sub - radiant state @xmath193 which is decoupled from the field modes and thus does not decay with time @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to enhance robustness of min by performing appropriate local unitary operations on the initial state , though the min itself is invariant under local unitary operations . as an explicit example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "4(b ) the numerical results obtained from the initial local unitary equivalent states @xmath194 with @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "it is clear that the strength of min at finite time @xmath198 can be tuned among regions bounded approximately by those obtained for the initial states @xmath174 with @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively .",
    "particularly , one can note that for the initial state @xmath174 with @xmath200 ( the top red line ) , the amount of min can even be enhanced by subjecting the two atoms to a common reservoir .",
    "in fact , for the initial state @xmath174 there exists a threshold phase angle @xmath201 ( depends on the system parameters ) beyond which the min as well as the quantum correlations measured by entanglement of formation ( denoted by @xmath202 ) @xcite , qd and gmqd can be enhanced to a larger value and further be frozen in the long time limit . in fig .",
    "5 we display numerical results of @xmath203 versus @xmath204 for @xmath205 with @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath206 . clearly , the threshold @xmath201 are different for different correlation measures , but @xmath207 always increases with increasing value of @xmath208 and attains the maxima at @xmath200 .",
    "this provides an efficient method for enhancing and storing min for future usage in external environments .",
    "one can also note that the curves for @xmath116 and @xmath209 are overlapped when @xmath210 , this is because during this parameter region @xmath3 is nondegenerate and @xmath42 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath35 ( see section ii ) .",
    "finally , we compare dynamical behaviors of min quantified by different measures .",
    "two exemplified plots with min quantified by @xmath116 and @xmath52 are presented in fig .",
    "6 , from which one can note that while for the initial state @xmath174 the two different measures give qualitatively similar characterizations of the min , for @xmath173 there exists states @xmath211 and @xmath212 which fulfill @xmath213<n^s[\\rho(t_2)]$ ] and @xmath214>n^v[\\rho(t_2)]$ ] .",
    "thus we see that the different measures of min are not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different in the sense that they may impose inequivalent orderings of quantum states .",
    "therefore , the lack of the same states ordering under different entanglement measures @xcite and other quantum correlation measures @xcite , goes beyond entanglement and quantum correlations .",
    "in this paper , we introduced the entropic measure of min based on the maximal difference between qmi of the pre- and post - measurement states . while the geometric measure of min @xcite quantifies the maximal hilbert - schmidt distance between @xmath0 and @xmath215 , the entropic measure of min introduced here quantifies the maximal loss of total correlations or equivalently , the maximal increment of von neumann entropy of @xmath0 by @xmath10 .",
    "it seems naturally a definition from information - theoretical point of view .",
    "based on this measure , we discussed conditions for nonvanishing min and consolidated the finding that there exists nonlocality without quantumness @xcite .",
    "for the two - qubit case , we further compared min with different quantum correlation measures @xcite , showing that some of them may assume equal values under certain special conditions , and a quantum state with the maximum @xmath115 does not always indicate that the state possess the maximum quantum correlation .",
    "since real physical system is inevitably coupled to its surroundings , in comparing with fragile entanglement , it is significant to study stability of min against decoherence . here as a concrete example , we evaluated min dynamics for a family of two - qubit states in the lorentzian structured reservoirs , and displayed their rich dynamical behaviors both for the markovian and non - markovian situations .",
    "we showed that the min can be frozen by increasing the detuning parameter , and for some initial states the strength of min as well as the quantum correlations can even be enhanced in the short time region and further be frozen in the long time limit by interacting the system with a common reservoir , the underlying reason for which may be the existent component of the decoherence - free state @xmath193 .",
    "finally , we studied the issue related to the relativity of different min measures , just as that of different entanglement @xcite and quantum correlation measures @xcite . by evaluating the dynamics of @xmath116 and @xmath52 in an non - markovian common reservoir",
    ", we showed that the two min measures do not necessarily imply the same ordering of quantum states .",
    "this is reminiscent of the cases for entanglement and quantum correlation measures and may indicate that the difference in nonlocality is rather measure dependent than state dependent . experimentally , besides atomic systems @xcite , two - qubit quantum state with different reservoirs , such as markovian and non - markovian , can be realized @xcite , and different correlations such as quantum discord have been shown recently @xcite .",
    "it will also be interesting to explore the entropic min of this paper in experiments .",

    "<S> we propose the entropic measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) as the maximal increment of von neumann entropy induced by the locally non - disturbing measurement , and study behaviors of it both in the independent and common structured reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> we present schemes for preserving the min , and show that for certain initial states the min , including the quantum correlations , can even be enhanced by the common reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we also show that the different measures of min may give different qualitative characterizations of nonlocal properties , i.e. , it is rather measure dependent than state dependent . </S>"
