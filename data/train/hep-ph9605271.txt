    "it is easy to see that the momentum fraction @xmath1 is the same as the bjorken @xmath1 .",

    "thus @xmath9 in the infinite momentum frame where masses may be disregarded .",
    "the relation between the observable structure function @xmath0 and the parton densities @xmath16 is , to @xmath17 , of the form @xmath18 + f_g \\left ( \\xi , q^2\\right ) \\ ; \\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}\\ ; c_g \\left ( \\frac{x}{\\xi}\\right ) \\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ]       where the partonic subprocesses are shown in fig .",

    "that is @xmath25 sums up the @xmath31 contributions .",
    "when truncating the power series at a given power of @xmath32 , say @xmath33 , the renormalisation of the @xmath16 introduces a scheme dependence of @xmath34 . traditionally the @xmath35 scheme is used .",
    "the parton densities describe not only deep - inelastic scattering , but all hard scattering processes with incoming nucleons . as we have noted , the densities @xmath36 have to be determined by experiment at some scale @xmath37 .",
    "the basic procedure is to parametrize the @xmath1 dependence at some low @xmath38 , but where perturbative qcd should be applicable , and then to evolve up in @xmath5 using the nlo dglap equations to determine @xmath36 at all the values of @xmath39 of the data .",

    "although the present parton treatment of charm appears to be satisfactory , it is clear that future more precise data will be invaluable in the investigations of the proper treatment of @xmath64 effects . in summary , the data imply that at the input scale , @xmath38 = 4 gev@xmath40 , the charm sea carries about 0.4% of the proton s momentum , as compared to nearly 4% by the strange sea , 6% by the up sea and 9% by the down sea .",

    "the constraints on the gluon come mainly from ( i ) the momentum sum rule , ( ii ) prompt photon production , and ( iii ) the scaling violations of @xmath0 . scaling violations impose the tightest constraint in the small @xmath1 region , where the gluon is the dominant parton .",

    "it is not possible to use the prompt photon data ( especially those at higher energy ) to pin down the gluon .",
    "the most reliable determination comes from the lower energy @xmath97 data of the wa70 collaboration , where the broadening is much less has the advantage that the dominant lo subprocess is @xmath101 , unlike @xmath98 where @xmath102 gives a comparable contribution . ] , but even here there is an ambiguity of some @xmath103 25% in the value of the gluon .",

    "there are indications from the medium @xmath115 cdf ( and also from the preliminary d0 ) jet data that the observed spectra favour @xmath117 in the region 0.116 to 0.120 @xcite . again",

    "the nlo contributions are known and the scheme dependence has just been quantified . indeed mirkes and zeppenfeld @xcite have presented to this conference a detailed study of the jet algorithms and conclude that the cone or @xmath121 schemes are favoured and lead to less scale dependence than the other schemes .",
    "the clean identification and kinematic measurement of the jets is the experimental challenge .",

    "no reliable prediction can be made in this singular boundary region without resummation of large logarithmic corrections caused by multigluon emission .",
    "if the small @xmath99 region is excluded from the analysis , the nlo result accounts for the energy dependence of the cross section and for the overall normalization , see fig",
    ".  8 @xcite .",
    "however , since the average momentum fraction of the partons is shifted to larger values when excluding the small-@xmath99 region , the sensitivity of the prediction to the small-@xmath1 behaviour of the gluon distribution is not very distinctive .",
    "diffractive @xmath122 photoproduction appears to offer a more promising way to distinguish between the gluon distributions .",
    "since this is essentially an elastic process the cross section is a measure of the square of the gluon density . to leading order the cross section",

    "it was emphasized that the @xmath127 dependence , rather than the normalisation , was the more reliable discriminator between the gluons .",
    "the power of the method is evident from fig .",
    "9 , which appears to favour the mrs(a@xmath94 ) gluon .",
    "further phenomenological studies of this process can be found in refs .",
    "we have seen that the gluon is by far the dominant parton in the small @xmath1 regime . indeed in the perturbative region it drives the entire partonic structure of the proton via the @xmath129 and @xmath130 transitions .    so far our description of the data , including the small @xmath1 hera data down to @xmath131 gev@xmath40 , has been based on the dglap resummation of lo and nlo @xmath26 terms .",
    "in fact the rise of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath1 that is observed at hera appears to be well described by the simplest approximation for the small @xmath1 behaviour of the gluon .",

    "that is , in this double logarithm approximation , @xmath136 increases faster than any power of @xmath137 , but slower than a power of @xmath138 .",
    "this behaviour feeds through into @xmath0 and gives an excellent description of the data , as emphasized by ball and forte @xcite ; the steepness of the rise in @xmath0 can be tuned to the data by adjusting the evolution length @xmath139 .",
    "does the success of the dglap description of the hera data indicate the dominance of the @xmath26 resummations and the absence of higher twists ?",
    "such a conclusion would be premature . at small @xmath1 , @xmath140",
    ", we have , so far , only one type of data @xmath141 and there is freedom in the description , particularly as we have to supply the non - perturbative input at some scale @xmath142 .",
    "clearly at sufficiently small @xmath1 the ( nlo ) dglap evolution will break down .",
    "when @xmath143 we have to also resum @xmath144 contributions ( or , to be more precise , a whole series of @xmath145 terms ) . at lo ,",
    "the @xmath146 resummation is accomplished by the bfkl equation @xcite . in a physical gauge",
    ", the @xmath146 term corresponds to an @xmath28-rung effective ladder diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) in which the soft gluon emissions are strongly - ordered in longitudinal momenta , but in which the transverse momenta are no longer ordered . due to the latter fact",
    "we have to introduce the gluon distribution @xmath147 unintegrated over @xmath148 , and anticipate a diffusion in @xmath149 as we proceed along the gluon chain .",
    "the relation to the conventional gluon is given by @xmath150 in principle , in the small @xmath1 domain the unintegrated distributions are the universal parton distributions which link process to process , via the @xmath121 factorization theorem @xcite .",

    "* an underlying soft pomeron contribution has to be included in the small @xmath1 region , determined by the extrapolation of the observed values of @xmath0 at large @xmath1 .",

    "* we need further studies of a unified approach which incorporates , on a sound theoretical footing , both the bfkl and dglap resummations .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that there are many issues to be resolved .",
    "we see that it will not be easy to quantify the importance of the @xmath2 bfkl - type contributions by using the effective @xmath163 dependence of the measured values of @xmath0 at small @xmath1 , that is @xmath166",
    ".    there has recently been much activity @xcite based on expanding the anomalous dimensions @xmath167 in terms of @xmath32 and the moment variable @xmath168 .",
    "for instance , for the gluon anomalous dimension , ( lo ) dglap resummation amounts to summing the terms @xmath169 whereas bfkl resums a different subset of terms @xmath170 with the @xmath171 term corresponding to a @xmath172 contribution to @xmath173 ( except for @xmath174 where @xmath175 , see ( [ eq : a ] ) ) .",

    ", this approach appears to offer the attractive possibility of quantifying the importance of @xmath2 effects by studying dglap - type evolution with anomalous dimensions ( and coefficient functions ) which incorporate the @xmath184 terms .",
    "however , it has been pointed out @xcite that such a procedure masks the true dependence on contributions from the infrared region . due to the diffusion in @xmath149 at small",
    "@xmath1 , an @xmath184 contribution , which in dglap is assigned to the local point @xmath5 , actually samples the region of ( the logarithm of ) virtuality @xmath185 where @xmath186 increases approximately as @xmath187 . due to the large numerical coefficient , @xmath188 ( with @xmath189 ) , in the diffusion term in ( [ eq : d ] ) , there is considerable implicit penetration into the infrared region .",
    "for example it is found that the @xmath190 term samples virtualities down to @xmath191 @xcite .",

    "we briefly reviewed other ways in which the gluon may be measured .",
    "jet production at fermilab and at hera offer not only a constraint on the gluon , but also provide a sensitive measure of the running of @xmath32 .    finally , we briefly discussed the perturbative qcd expectations for the behaviour of the gluon in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "we emphasized the importance of resumming the @xmath146 terms when @xmath1 is sufficiently small so that @xmath194 .",
    "we highlighted the problems of incorporating these effects in the description of @xmath0 and the necessity to use the unintegrated gluon distribution together with the @xmath121 factorization theorem .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the experimental measurements in the small @xmath1 domain serves as a challenge to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of this fascinating frontier of qcd .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank dick roberts and james stirling , and jan kwieciski and peter sutton for most enjoyable research collaborations on the structure of the proton and misha ryskin for valuable discussions . also to thank our hosts in krakw for arranging an excellent workshop .",
