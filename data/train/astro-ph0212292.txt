    "to go from stationary to dynamical models we use a gaseous model of star clusters in its anisotropic version .",
    "it is based on the basic assumptions that : the system can be described by a one particle distribution function , the secular evolution is dominated by the cumulative effect of small angle deflections with small impact parameters ( fokker - planck approximation , good for large @xmath4-particle systems ) and that the effect of the two - body relaxation can be modelled by a local heat flux equation with an appropriately tailored conductivity .",
    "in spherical symmetry polar coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are used and @xmath9 denotes the time .",
    "the vector @xmath10 denotes the velocity in a local cartesian coordinate system at the spatial point @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath12 is a function of , @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 only due to spherical symmetry . by multiplication of the fokker - planck equation ( 1.1 ) with various powers of the velocity components we get up to second order a set of moment equations which is equivalent to gas - dynamical equations coupled with poisson s equation : a mass equation , a continuity equation , an euler equation ( force ) , radial and tangential energy equations .",
    "the system of equations is closed by a phenomenological heat flux equation for the flux of radial and tangential r.m.s .",
    "kinetic energy , both in radial direction .          in the paper by langbein",
    "et al . ( 1990 ) they derive the interaction terms to be added to the basic equations of the gaseous model . according to them ,",
    "the star continuity equation is no longer @xmath15 but @xmath16 where the right - hand term reflects the time variation of the star s density due to stars interactions ( i.e. due to the calculation of the mean rate of gas production by stars collisions ) and loss - cone ( stars plunging onto the central object ) .",
    "as regards @xmath20 , it is the relative fraction of mass liberated per stellar collision into the gaseous medium . under certain assumptions given in the initial work of spitzer & saslaw ( 1966 ) ,",
    "we can calculate it as an average over all impact parameters resulting in @xmath21 and as a function of the relative velocity at infinity of the two colliding stars , @xmath22 .",
    "langbein et al .",
    "( 1990 ) approximate their result by          computed for an average distance of closest approach @xmath28 , this time is @xmath29 and so , @xmath30 with @xmath31 @xmath32 is the stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath33 a collisional cross section with gravitational focusing .",
    "since the evolution of the system that we are studying can be regarded as stationary , we introduce for each equation the `` logarithmic variables '' in order to study the evolution at long - term .",
    "in the other hand , if the system happens to have quick changes , we should use the `` non - logarithmic '' version of the equations .",
    "for this reason we will write at the end of each subsection the equation in terms of the logarithmic variables .",
    "the interaction term is due to the decelerating force at which stars that move inside the gas are subject to .",
    "explicitely , it is @xmath40 where we have introduced the following definition : @xmath41 with @xmath42 0.3 cm to the end of the calculation of the logarithmic variable version of the equation , we multiply by @xmath43 : @xmath44      as regards the last but one equation , the interaction terms are : @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 in order to determine @xmath48 we introduce the ratio @xmath49 of kinetic energy of the remaining mass after the encounter over its initial value ( before the encounter ) ; @xmath49 is a measure of the inelasticity of the collision : for @xmath50 we have the minimal inelasticity , just the kinetic energy of the liberated mass fraction is dissipated , whereas if @xmath51 a surplus amount of stellar kinetic energy is dissipated during the collision ( tidal interactions and excitation of stellar oscillations ) . if we calculate the energy loss in the stellar system per unit volume as a function of @xmath49 we obtain @xmath52.\\ ] ]                                          we modify equation number ( 2.9 ) of langbein et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in the following way : @xmath64 we substitute this equality in their equation , divide by @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the variable in our code ) and make use of the equation of continuity for the gas component .",
    "thus , we get the following expression : @xmath67 to get the interaction term we use the mass and momentum conservation : @xmath68 @xmath69 we know that @xmath70 thus , @xmath71 therefore , the resulting interaction term is @xmath72 in the case of the stellar system @xmath73 by analogy , we now introduce @xmath74 in this way @xmath75 where @xmath76 is per gas particle . @xmath77",
    "as means to write the equation in its `` logarithmic variable version '' , we multiply the equation by @xmath78 , as we did for the corresponding momentum balance star equation and replace @xmath79 by @xmath80 , @xmath81      we get the radiation transfer equations by re - writing the frequency - integrated moment equations from amaro - seoane et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : we divide their first equation by @xmath82 and multiply the second one by @xmath83 , @xmath84      where we have substituted @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the absorption and extinction coefficients per unit mass @xmath89 @xmath90 is the cooling function , @xmath91 the planck function and @xmath92 the scattering coefficient per unit mass . we have made use of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the kirchhoff s law , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is the emission coefficient ) .      it is enlightening to construct an equation for the energy per volume unit @xmath97 which , in the case of an isotropic gas ( @xmath98 ) is @xmath99 . for this aim",
    "we take , for instance , equation ( [ eqn : pr ] ) and in the term @xmath100 we include now a source for radiation pressure , @xmath101 and we divide everything by @xmath102 so that we get the logarithmic variables .",
    "the resulting equation is                our model has seven dependent variables , @xmath107 so we have a set of non - linear , coupled differential equations plus an initial model , which very often is a plummer s model . to solve our equations we discretise them on a logarithmic radial mesh with typically 200 logarithmically equidistant mesh points , covering radial scales over eight orders of magnitude ;",
    "e.g. from 100 pc down to @xmath108 pc , which is enough to resolve the system down to the vicinity of a massive black hole s tidal disruption radius for stars .",
    "an implicit newton - raphson - henyey iterative method is used to solve for the time evolution of our system .",
    "let @xmath109 be a column - vector for the seven equations : @xmath110 the solution to the equations is @xmath111 ; therefore , @xmath112 suppose that @xmath113 is a close value to the solution @xmath111 , @xmath114 thus , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is an `` error function '' that contains the difference between the exact value and the approximation . since we have assumed that @xmath113 is a close value to @xmath111 , @xmath117 therefore , since @xmath118 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a @xmath121 matrix .",
    "we iterate the process until we reach @xmath122 where @xmath123 stands for the n - iteration done .",
    "this gives us the termination of the iteration .",
    "our results compare well with other studies using direct solutions of the fokker - planck equation or monte carlo models ( lightman & shapiro 1977 , marchant & shapiro 1980 ) .",
    "note that the monte carlo approach has been recently revisited and improved by freitag & benz ( 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast to the other models the gaseous model is much more versatile to include all kinds of important other physical effects , such as the dynamics of gas liberated in nuclei by stellar evolution and collisions and its interaction with the stellar component ."
