    "this paper is concerned with semi - lagrangian methods for the following dirichlet boundary value problem of a fully nonlinear elliptic monge - ampre - type equation :    [ ma_intro ] @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote respectively a bounded strictly convex domain in @xmath3 and its boundary .",
    "the hessian of the function @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 .",
    "the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are bounded and continuous .",
    "we note that the special form of the right - hand side in [ ma ] is chosen for the notational convenience in the subsequent analysis ; the usual form can be easily recovered by setting @xmath8 .",
    "monge - ampre type equations , along with hamilton - jacobi - bellman type equations ( see below ) , are two major classes of fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "they arise from many scientific and technological applications such as antenna design , astrophysics , differential geometry , image processing , optimal mass transport and semi - geostrophic fluids , to name a few ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for details ) . from the pde point of view",
    ", monge - ampre type equations are well understood , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 17 ) for a detailed account on the classical solution theory and @xcite for the viscosity solution theory . on the other hand , from the numerical point of view",
    ", the situation is far from ideal .",
    "very few numerical methods , which can reliably and efficiently approximate viscosity solutions of monge - ampre type pdes on general convex domains , are available in the literature ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "there are three main difficulties which lead to the lack of progress on approximating viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second order pdes .",
    "firstly , the fully nonlinear structure and nonvariational concept of viscosity solutions of the pdes prevent a direct formulation of any galerkin - type numerical methods ( such as finite element , discontinuous galerkin and spectral methods ) .",
    "secondly , the monge - ampre operator , @xmath9 , is not an elliptic operator in generality , instead , it is only elliptic in the set of convex functions and the uniqueness of viscosity solutions only holds in that space .",
    "this convexity constraint , imposed on the admissible space , causes a daunting challenge for constructing convergent numerical methods ; it indeed screens out any trivial finite difference and finite element analysis because the set of convex finite element functions is not dense in the set of convex functions  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , as the right - hand side @xmath10 of [ ma ] vanishes , the monge - ampre mapping attains characteristics of a degenerate elliptic operator . in this setting the regularity of exact solutions is reduced , limiting the tools available for a convergence analysis of numerical solutions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a new approach for constructing convergent numerical methods for the monge - ampre dirichlet problem [ ma_intro ] , in particular , by focusing on overcoming the second difficulty caused by the convexity constraint .",
    "the crux of the approach is to first establish an equivalent ( in the viscosity sense ) bellman formulation of the monge - ampre equation and then to design monotone semi - lagrangian methods for the resulting bellman equation on general triangular grids .",
    "the proposed methods are closely related to two - grid constructions because we use a finite element ambient grid to define the approximation space , combined with wide finite - difference stencils layered over this ambient grid .",
    "an aim in the design of the numerical schemes is to make howard s algorithm available , which is a globally superlinearly converging semi - smooth newton solver .",
    "this allows us to robustly compute numerical approximations on very fine meshes of non - smooth viscosity solutions , including the degenerate case where @xmath11 .",
    "an advantage of the rigorous convergence analysis of the numerical solutions is the comparison principle for the bellman operator , which extends to non - convex functions .",
    "we deviate from the established barles - souganidis framework in the treatment of the boundary conditions to address challenges arising from consistency and comparison .",
    "the proposed approach also bridges the gap between advances on numerical methods for these two classes of second order fully nonlinear pdes , see for instance @xcite and the references therein for the numerical literature on bellman equations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : viscsol ] we collect preliminaries including the definition of viscosity solutions . in [ sec : ma_hjb ] we introduce a well - known hamilton - jacobi - bellman reformulation of the monge - ampre equation in the classical solution setting and prove such an equivalence still holds in the viscosity solution framework . in [ sec : slmethods ] we introduce a numerical scheme [ eq : disc ] for the monge - ampre equation . in [ sec - dwp ]",
