    "solubility is the capacity of a given solute to form a homogeneous solution in a given solvent .",
    "the solubility of one substance in another is determined by the balance of intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute , and the entropy change that accompanies the solvation .",
    "factors such as temperature and pressure will alter this balance , thus changing the solubility .    in the process of dissolving a solute ,",
    "heat is required to break the intermolecular forces between the solute particles and heat is given off by forming bonds between solute and solvent particles .",
    "consequently , increasing the temperature can make it easier or harder to dissolve solute particles in a solvent .    in the case of dissolving solids ,",
    "the energy required to break the intermolecular forces between the solute particles is usually higher than the energy liberated by forming bonds with the solvent , therefore , the ability of the solvent to dissolve the solid solute increases with the temperature .    in the dissolution of gases in liquid solvents",
    "the scenario is more complex . for a low density gas phase ,",
    "the solubility is the equilibrium constant of the process in which a solute particle dissolved in the liquid evaporates into the gas phase .",
    "this quantity can be express in terms of the inverse of the the henry s constant .",
    "the equilibrium constant can be computed by the balance between the solute - solute , solvent - solvent and solute - solvent energies , namely @xmath0 , and it is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath2 , the solubility increases with temperature , otherwise it decreases .",
    "this approach , based in a simple `` bragg - williams approximation '' , does not allow for entropic effects besides the combinatory term that differenciats solute from solvent particles  @xcite .",
    "this simple picture is valid for a number of solvents and solutes but not for non - polar gases in water .",
    "the solubility of noble gases in water decreases with the temperature until a certain threshold , and then it increases @xcite .",
    "this experimental result has also being observed in the solubility of hard spheres simulated for effective @xcite and atomistic models of water @xcite .",
    "besides the unusual behavior of solubility , water also exhibits other thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies . unlike other liquids ,",
    "water does not contract upon cooling and the specific volume at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below @xmath3",
    "experimental data show that the diffusion constant @xmath4 , increases on compression at low temperatures @xmath5 , up to a maximum , @xmath6 at @xmath7 @xcite while for normal liquids the diffusion coefficient decreases as the system is compressed .",
    "these findings were also supported by simulations both in atomistic  @xcite and in effective models  @xcite .",
    "even though both experiments and simulations indicate that non - polar gases exhibit an anomalous behavior in the solubility in the same region of pressures and temperatures where other anomalies are present , a clear connection between these thermodynamic and dynamic properties is still missing .    in this paper",
    "we aim to shade some light into this problem by computing the solubility of non - interacting particles in a lattice model for water . even though there are a number of two and three dimensional lattice models that would in principle exhibit the anomalies present in water  @xcite , here water",
    "is represented by the associating lattice gas @xcite that have already shown the density and diffusion anomalies described above .",
    "the solute is represented by pure hard sphere in an attempt to model simple gases .",

    "the solute can be located at any site , while in the ldl phase the solute goes only to the empty half - lattice ( see fig .",

    "the solubility is related with the amount of energy required to include a solute particle in the system . in the gas phase , as the temperature is increased , the solubility decreases because the density of the gas phase increases with temperature making more difficult to include an extra solute particle . in the hdl phase the density of solvent decreases with the increase of temperature ,",
    "therefore the solubility decreases with the decrease of temperature . in the ldl phase a very interesting behavior",
    "is observed .",
    "the density , which at zero temperature is @xmath65 , increases with the temperature . in this low temperature region",
    "the increase of the solvent density leaves less space for including a new solute particle and the solubility decreases .",
    "however , as the temperature is increased even further , the density of the ldl phase reaches a maximum and decreases due to entropic effects .",
    "consequently , the solubility reaches a minimum at the maximum of solvent density , and increases with @xmath66 as the system becomes less dense .",
    "the decrease of the solubility with the increase of the temperature is also observed in a minimal lattice models proposed by widom and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the focus of these different studies on the model properties have been on the relation between strength and range of the solvent mediated attraction , thus density effects , which would promote increasing solubility at larger temperatures , were left aside  @xcite .",
    "obviously the solubility governed solely by density effects is only possible because the solute particles , in our study , are non interacting .          in this section ,",
    "we present results obtained from the cluster variational approximation , introduced for the pure solvent version of this model by buzano _",
