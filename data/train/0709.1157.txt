    "we have studied sneutrino decays in the cases of @xmath20 and @xmath112 mixings in the slepton sector . in the case of @xmath6 mixing we have obtained similar results to those in the @xmath20 mixing case since the experimental limit on @xmath31 is of the same order of magnitude as the one on @xmath32 .",

    "mixing case the lfv effect is much smaller because the experimental limit on @xmath114 is much stronger than those on @xmath32 and @xmath31 and the theoretical limits from the vacuum stability conditions on the lfv parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 are also much stronger than those on @xmath117 and @xmath34 .",

    "we have shown that lfv sneutrino production cross sections and lfv sneutrino decay branching ratios can be quite large due to lfv in the slepton sector ( i.e. due to slepton generation mixing ) in a significant part of the mssm parameter space despite the very strong experimental limits on lfv processes .",

    "<S> it is to be noted that the production cross sections @xmath38 for @xmath39 with @xmath40 are negligible in the @xmath41 mixing scenario of table [ tab1 ] . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , the s - channel @xmath44 boson exchange can not contribute to the cross section for @xmath39 because of the vanishing @xmath45 couplings , which is due to the unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason the dependence of the cross sections @xmath47 with @xmath48 on the lfv parameter @xmath49 is very weak in this scenario .    in the @xmath6 mixing scenario , however , the influence of slepton generation mixing on @xmath50 is completely different from that in the @xmath20 mixing scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in the @xmath22 mixing scenario the t - channel chargino exchanges contribute significantly to the cross sections @xmath51 for @xmath521,3 , enhancing the cross sections strongly and yielding pronounced dependences of the cross sections on the @xmath53 mixing parameter @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> all parameters other than @xmath54 are fixed as in our @xmath6 mixing scenario described in subsection [ brs ] . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the production of a pair of sneutrinos with different masses is a unique signal of lfv . </S>",
    "<S> this cross section @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) can be as large as about 17fb in this scenario as can be seen in fig.6 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xcite shows that the sneutrino mass can be measured with an error of about 0.6 % at ilc . in our case </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a mass uncertainty of about 2.5 gev and hence the expected mass difference @xmath61 of about 10 gev should be measurable at ilc .      </S>",

    "<S> colliders the experimental sensitivity to @xmath6 mixing is in general larger than that to @xmath20 mixing because of the larger sneutrino production cross sections due to the sizable t - channel chargino exchange contributions @xcite . </S>",
