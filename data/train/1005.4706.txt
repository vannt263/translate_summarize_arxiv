    "high - mass ( @xmath9 m@xmath1 ) and low - mass ( @xmath10 m@xmath1 ) star formation seem to require some fundamentally different conditions and physical processes that probably involve differences in turbulence and magnetic fields within their formative clouds as much as differences in cloud mass and density @xcite .",
    "stars forming in the 2 to 8 solar mass range ( intermediate - mass ; i m ) are especially interesting as they straddle the boundary between the low- and high - mass paradigms and can provide a window into the processes that govern the transition from low - mass to high - mass star formation .",
    "extensive studies of these i m star - forming regions ( i m sfrs ) , i.e. , sfrs where the most massive star is i m , have not been possible in the past due to difficulties in clearly identifying the regions and the lack of angular resolution to investigate them in detail .",
