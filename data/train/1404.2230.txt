    "<S> we investigate a mechanism to establish ground - state ferromagnetism in flat - band hubbard systems based on a kind of _ order - from - disorder _ effect driven by dispersion . as a paradigm we consider a frustrated diamond chain , where for ideal diamond geometry the lowest one - electron band is flat , but the ground state remains paramagnetic for arbitrary on - site repulsion @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on half filling of the flat band . by using numerical and analytical arguments we present the ground - state phase diagram for a distorted diamond chain , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the former flat band becomes dispersive . </S>",
    "<S> driven by the interplay of dispersion and interaction the ground state is ferromagnetic if the interaction exceeds a critical value @xmath1 .    electronic as well as localized - spin systems with dispersionless ( i.e. , flat ) one - particle bands offer a unique playground in view of realizing unconventional low - temperature phases , see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> an illustrious example is the fractional quantum hall effect caused by interactions within the highly degenerate manifold of the dispersionless landau levels.@xcite very recently , remarkably in flat - band systems high - temperature fractional quantum hall states without a magnetic field were found.@xcite relevant perturbations leading to dispersion of the one - particle band or interactions between the particles may yield highly non - trivial correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing example is the ferromagnetic instability in flat - band hubbard models when the interaction prevails against the kinetic energy.@xcite this class of interacting quantum systems belongs to the notoriously rare examples where rigorous results for many - body ground states are available . </S>",
    "<S> after the seminal papers by mielke and tasaki @xcite a continuous theoretical activity in this field can be recorded.@xcite additional interest in this subject stems from the experimental side . besides several promising materials realizing flat - band ferromagnetism ( fm),@xcite generated flat - band phases in optical lattices open a wide area for experimental research activities , see , e.g. , refs .  .    a crucial point to understand the mechanism leading to flat - band fm is the existence of localized eigenstates , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the particles can be localized within small trapping cells on a lattice see , e.g. , refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> thus many - electron ground states can be constructed by filling the traps obeying the pauli principle , and a geometrical representation of the localized many - particle states is at hand . as a result </S>",
    "<S> relevant quantum degrees of freedom can be mapped on classical ones thus providing the powerful toolbox of classical statistical mechanics.@xcite in addition , it is worth noticing that this mapping also opens a window to a new percolation problem , called pauli - correlated percolation , in which the first - order nature of an equilibrium percolation transition can be established.@xcite these findings indicate that hubbard flat - band systems are of broad conceptual relevance .    based on the geometrical interpretation of the localized many - body states the saturated fm then corresponds to the full occupation of all trapping cells say with up - electrons.@xcite importantly , it is necessary to have overlapping traps ( i.e. , neighboring cells must share at least one site ) . </S>",
    "<S> then even if all the cells are occupied with electrons having identical spin ( symmetric spin state ) they can avoid the hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath2 and this fully polarized state remains within the ground - state manifold . </S>",
    "<S> however , in case that the trapping cells are isolated from each other there is no route to fm and the large set of paramagnetic states prevails against the ferromagnetic eigenstate.@xcite    introducing dispersion ( violation of the flat - band geometry ) typically modifies the balance of interaction and kinetic energy and tends to destabilize fm . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was demonstrated by several studies that the ferromagnetic ground state is robust if the flat band becomes ( slightly ) dispersive and the hubbard repulsion @xmath0 is larger than a threshold @xmath3 , where @xmath1 depends on the degree of the violation of the flat - band geometry.@xcite    in the present paper we will demonstrate that unexpectedly for a certain class of flat - band systems having isolated trapping cells just the dispersion , i.e. , the kinetic energy , will open the route to ferromagnetic ground states . </S>",
    "<S> this dispersion - driven fm resembles the celebrated _ order - from - disorder _ </S>",
    "<S> mechanism,@xcite i.e. , due to distortions an ordered ground state is selected from the degenerate flat - band ground - state manifold where paramagnetic states dominate .    </S>",

    "<S> the flat - band case is realized for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then electrons can be localized within a characteristic trapping cell ( vertical dimer ) due to destructive quantum interference . </S>",

    "<S> .    owing to the localized nature of the one - electron flat - band states the many - electron states in the subspaces with @xmath25 electrons for @xmath2 can be constructed by filling the traps arbitrarily with up- or down - spin electrons leading to macroscopic ground state degeneracy of @xmath26 , where the paramagnetic states are predominant . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig02 ] . for not too large deviations from ideal geometry controlled by @xmath46 and for sufficiently large @xmath47 , the ground state of the hubbard diamond chain with half - filled lowest band is ferromagnetic ( the region denoted as `` fm '' ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now illustrate briefly our calculations leading to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] . the lanczos ed to calculate the ground states </S>",
    "<S> was performed for chains of @xmath43 sites , i.e. , of @xmath48 unit cells , with periodic boundary conditions imposed . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath44 and consider various values of @xmath11 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] we present data for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter characterizing the dispersion was varied from @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) to @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . for </S>",
    "<S> quite ( but not arbitrarily ) large deviations from ideal geometry @xmath40 and sufficiently large @xmath55 there is a unique ferromagnetic ground state , i.e. , the ground state is a ferromagnetic su(2 ) multiplet which has the degeneracy @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit @xmath57 there is a maximal dispersion @xmath58 above which ground - state fm does not exist . as expected there is a finite - size dependence of @xmath41 , but the general shape of the curve is the same for all @xmath9 . interestingly the region of fm increases with growing system size @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 sites with @xmath49 we found in the limit @xmath61 the values @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , respectively . that gives clear evidence that the dispersion - driven fm exists for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the vertical hopping integral @xmath11 on the phase boundary @xmath41 is visible from the corresponding curves for @xmath64 . for small band width @xmath40 the region of fm </S>",
    "<S> slightly shrinks with increasing of @xmath11 , whereas @xmath1 grows with increasing @xmath11 for @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally mention , that the dispersion does not change substantially the charge order present for the ideal flat - band geometry . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath64 , @xmath66 , @xmath49 , @xmath67 the occupation of the intermediate sites amounts less than 10% of the occupation of the sites of the trapping cells .    in the next step </S>",
    "<S> we complement our numerical data by fourth - order pt . </S>",
    "<S> we will illustrate only some main features of this approach . </S>",
    "<S> more details can be found in the appendix . in fourth order </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to consider a @xmath68-site cluster that contains two trapping cells ( the sites @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 connected by six bonds in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we apply standard pt.@xcite the unperturbed hamiltonian contains just the @xmath11- and @xmath0-terms ( recall that @xmath75 is the dominating hopping integral ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation contains the @xmath32- and @xmath31-terms . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed ground states in the two - electron subspace with accounting su(2 ) symmetry have the form @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( the components of the triplet state ) , and @xmath79 ( the singlet state ) . here </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath83 is independent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the singlet state @xmath84 depends on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for the forth - order analytical expression for @xmath85 see the appendix . in the limit @xmath86 it becomes @xmath87 and @xmath88 due to the fourth - order term . </S>",

    "<S> the dominating term in @xmath85 is @xmath89 which obviously leads to the opposite inequality @xmath90 , i.e. , the ground state is nonmagnetic . to determine the critical value of @xmath1 , above which the ground state is ferromagnetic we have to solve the equation @xmath91 which gives @xmath92 obviously , for small deviations from the flat - band case , i.e. , @xmath93 , we get @xmath94 . the graphical representation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 303 ] ) is shown by the thick long - dashed green line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian describing the low - energy degrees of freedom of the 5-site two - electron hubbard problem is the 2-site spin-1/2 heisenberg model @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97/4 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudospin operators are given by @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange constant @xmath101 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> another consequence of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 303 ] ) is that @xmath104 if @xmath105 , i.e. , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 303 ] ) yields @xmath106 . as a direct check of the fourth - order pt results for @xmath83 and @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> we have performed ed for the @xmath68-site cluster , see the dashed blue line with empty down - triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is excellent .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , the pt confirms our ed results for the existence of fm . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative agreement between ed and pt is the better the smaller @xmath40 and the larger @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of ground - state fm for deviations from ideal geometry is a result of fourth - order processes . </S>",
    "<S> higher - order pt naturally would enlarge the region of quantitative agreement with ed data .    for experimental research </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a charge gap that would protect the considered state against charge fluctuations is of relevance . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned above such a charge gap exists for the ideal geometry.@xcite to calculate the charge gap for the distorted geometry we consider the grand - canonical setup adding to the hamiltonian ( [ 201 ] ) the term with a chemical potential , @xmath107 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03 ] we show the ground - state behavior of the averaged electron density ( per cell ) @xmath108 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a wide plateau appearing for @xmath110 at @xmath111 that is almost independent of the distortion . for @xmath112 </S>",
    "<S> the plateau is less pronounced and it disappears for @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the plateau @xmath114 corresponds to the size of the charge gap . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03 ] gives evidence that this charge gap is robust against the deviation from ideal flat - band geometry , and , thus , the protection works also in this case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the finite - size dependence is small ( see also refs .  ) .     versus chemical potential @xmath115 for the frustrated diamond chain of @xmath64 sites with @xmath49 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath86 . </S>",

    "<S> it is protected by a charge gap against charge fluctuations and exhibits also charge ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the discussed scenario of dispersion - driven fm is not restricted to specific geometry of the frustrated diamond chain , rather it is quite general for lattices with isolated cells including two - dimensional ones . </S>",
    "<S> indeed ed calculations confirm this expectations for the lattices considered in ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> our focus on the diamond - chain geometry is motivated by the fact that this geometry is often found in natural compounds , see , e.g. , refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> its simplicity is advantageous in realizing this geometry , e.g. , in optical lattices or quantum dot arrays . since one may expect that it is hard to realize the perfect flat - band geometry in experiments the discussion of distortions is of crucial relevance .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an ongoing experimental search for flat - band ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of flat - band fm in quantum dot arrays and in quantum atomic wires formed on solid surfaces was discussed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> other examples for the flat - band ferromagnets come from polymers@xcite where a search for purely organic ferromagnets is known as a challenging target . </S>",
    "<S> another experimental realization of the flat - band fm has been discussed recently in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> specific organic molecules [ tetracyano-@xmath127-quinodimethane ( tcnq ) molecules ] deposited on graphene epitaxially grown on ru(0001 ) acquire charge from the substrate and develop a magnetic moment which survives when the molecules form a monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> claim that the intermolecular bands are almost flat and half - filled and that the tcnq / graphene / ru(0001 ) system might be a realization of the flat - band hubbard ferromagnets .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical study provides a further route in search of flat - band ferromagnets : for this purpose one can use not only mielke s or tasaki s flat - band systems.@xcite also flat - band systems which do not show ground - state fm for ideal geometry are promising candidates , since one may expect that deviations from the perfect flat - band geometry are always present in experimental realizations of such systems . </S>"
