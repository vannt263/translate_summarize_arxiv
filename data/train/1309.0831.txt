    "the successful discovery of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson in the mass region around 125 - 126 gev confidence level .",
    "the mass of the new particle has also been measured precisely in zz decay channel : @xmath0 newresults . ]",
    "could open a new stage of motivations in phenomenological studies of extended higgs sectors ( ehs ) . the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm )",
    "is one of the simplest examples of ehs , which represents the non - trivial next extension compatible with the gauge invariance and with the electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ewssb ) in the sm . in this framework",
    ", a second higgs doublet is added with the same quantum numbers as the first one .",
    "the 2hdm induces several features , among them we have @xcite : i ) the possibility of generating either spontaneous or explicit cp violation , ii ) the generation of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) ( inspired on neutrino oscillations ) still compatible with the strong experimental limits on them , and iii ) the prospect that some theories with larger symmetries end up at low energies in a non minimal higgs sector as in the case of susy and left - right models .",
    "the discrete symmetry @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is usually implemented in the 2hdm because it forbids mixing between the two doublets .",
    "moreover , this symmetry ensures a cp- conserving frame in the scalar sector and fcncs are forbidden . in the last point ,",
    "the @xmath1 transformation unfolds the 2hdm since its presence ( absence ) leads to different forms of the yukawa couplings between fermions and higgs bosons with ( without ) flavor natural conservation .    in the cp - conserving frame ,",
    "after the ewssb all eight components of the two doublets are transformed into three goldstone bosons ( @xmath4 ) , two cp - even higgs bosons ( @xmath5 ) , one cp - odd higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) and two charged higgs bosons ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "although experimental accessibility is now significant , those scenarios of 2hdm remain unknown . hence , theoretical constraints must be obtained by making additional fundamental assumptions on the quantum field theory background of the 2hdm . among these constraints",
    "we have : vacuum stability , triviality , oblique parameters , and the unitarity at the tree level .",
    "triviality limits rely on the fact that the quartic couplings in the potential remain finite up to large scales of energy . on the other hand",
    ", the condition of vacuum stability requires that couplings in the higgs potential must be positive in all field space directions for their asymptotically large values , otherwise the potential would be unbounded from below and had no minimum .    on the other hand , @xmath8matrix unitarity is embodied in all perturbative levels due to the optical theorem ( ot)@xcite . especially , for asymptotically flat models ( wherein scattering amplitudes do not exhibit any power - like growth in the high energy limit ) , and main contributions lie at the tree level .",
    "therefore , the other theoretical constraints are guaranteed through forthright realization of perturbation theory .",
    "perturbative unitarity bounds are derived from the lee - quigg - thacker ( lqt ) method which shows that if the higgs boson mass @xmath9exceeds critical values obtained from partial wave decomposition , unitarity is violated at the tree level for different binary scattering processes @xmath10 at high energies , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these constraints have only been applied to bosonic scalar and bosonic vectorial sectors because the unitarity limits emerge from plane waves decomposition , which is only valid for spinless particles ( for vector bosons this formalism can be applied because of the theorem of equivalence ) . for fermionic sectors",
    "it is necessary to introduce a general partial waves decomposition where different spin states are involved .",
    "the jacob - wick expansion is the most natural and simplified method for partial diagonalization in the angular momentum basis , since such expansion relies on the appropriate choice of physical states in the initial characterization of scattering processes .",
    "attempts to constrain the fermionic sector of four generation models with criteria of unitarity ( but without this approach ) have been carried out in @xcite .    to incorporate all these concepts ,",
    "we first show some few issues of the 2hdm in section [ fundamentals ] , where the general yukawa sector is introduced and the fcnc s sources are described . at this point , we review the different phenomenological methods to obtain bounds on yukawa couplings . in section [ jwe ] , we consider the general form of the jacob - wick approach .",
    "assumptions over helicity states are imposed in order to obtain a decoupling regime of this method to the traditional wave expansion and thereby to build up unitarity constraints over their associated coefficients .",
    "then in section [ fermionic ] , some particular scattering processes involving fermionic interactions are studied within the framework of the 2hdm  type iii .",
    "the last section [ charged ] is dedicated to extrapolate this method to the study of charged channels of fermionic interactions .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given , and some prospects for further studies involving others models are established .",
    "the 2hdm is one of the simplest non - trivial extension of the higgs sector in the standard model , where two doublets of scalars with unit hypercharge are considered in order to achieve the electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the full lagrangian of the most general 2hdm contains additional terms with respect to the minimal sm in the scalar potential , the kinetic sector and the yukawa interactions sector .",
    "since there are two vacuum expectation values ( vev ) , one for each doublet , there could be in general a relative phase between them .",
    "this fact is the source for a spontaneous cp - violation coming from the ewssb , which produces a vacuum different from a neutral one .",
    "moreover , if the parameters in the scalar and yukawa potentials are complex , explicit cp violation also arises . since we are not going to treat these effects here , we assume all parameters and vevs to be real in the following .",
    "this formalism will be named the _ _  cp - conserving _ _ _",
    "2hdm frame_. on the other hand , the most general yukawa lagrangian has a set of dimension-4 higgs fermion couplings , given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denote the left - handed quark doublets -with @xmath14 the family index- .",
    "@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) correspond to the right - handed singlets of up - type ( down - type ) quarks .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are non - diagonal@xmath19matrices .",
    "the superscript 0  indicates that the fields are not mass eigenstates yet .",
    "the general yukawa lagrangian in ( [ ly ] ) leads to processes with flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at the tree level .",
    "it is due to the fact that by rotating the down sector of quarks ( or up and lepton sectors ) to get the mass eigenstates it is not possible to diagonalize both coupling matrices @xmath20 simultaneously .",
    "processes containing fcncs are strongly supressed experimentally , in particular due to the small @xmath21 mass difference . in sm",
    "the fcnc are strongly suppressed by virtue of the gim mechanism @xcite . in the 2hdm ,",
    "several mechanisms to suppress fcnc at the tree level were proposed .",
    "one of them is to consider the exchange of heavy scalar or pseudoscalar higgs fields or by cancellation of large values with opposite sign . in 2hdm ,",
    "one mechanism is provided by glashow and weinberg , who implemented in the yukawa lagrangian a discrete simmetry that automatically forbids the couplings among fermions and scalars that generate such rare decays . from @xmath22 mixing , as well as many processes involving kaon and muon decays @xcite , it has been considered that the heaviest fermion set the scale for the entire matrix of yukawa couplings .",
    "this assumption yields many stringent bounds for the heavy scalars , for instance 150 tev ( lower bound ) from @xmath22 mixing",
    ".    however the most outstanding feature of the fermion masses is their hierarchical structure .",
    "if we expect roughly the same hierarchy in the yukawa couplings , setting all the flavour changing ( fc ) couplings to be of the order of the heaviest - fermion yukawa couplings is not reliable sher . from these considerations , cheng and",
    "sher proposed that fc couplings should be of the order of the geometric mean of the yukawa couplings of the two fermions .",
    "such an ansatz leads to a parametrization for the yukawa couplings of the form    @xmath23    because under the cheng and sher ansatz we expect that @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "if the cheng and sher ansatz is correct , the fcnc coming from the first two generations are strongly supressed since the associated yukawa couplings are . as a consequence , the lower bound on higgs boson masses",
    "is reduced @xcite .",
    "it is usual to assume the validity of the cheng and sher ansatz in the 2hdm type iii , and its implications are explored in different studies .",
    "many searches focus on some few specific processes , including @xmath26 and @xmath27 , rare @xmath28 and @xmath29 decays ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 at the two loop level , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , muon - electron conversion , and @xmath34 .",
    "if the cheng and sher ansatz is correct , then one would expect from @xmath35 to be all of order unity ( emulating to sm ) .",
    "this request is very weak since there are unknown mixing angles .",
    "in addition , for many phenomenological limits , several scalar masses enter in all specific processes .",
    "one of the most stringent experimental constraints on the 2hdm comes from flavor physics . for the 2hdm with general ( flavor diagonal )",
    "yukawa couplings , and from the charged higgs contribution to different transitions such as @xmath34 in @xcite , bounds on @xmath36 were found ; which must be less or equal to unity when @xmath37 gev . with theoretical and experimental assumptions over sm predictions ( from qcd lattice ) of observables involving @xmath38 mixing ( with @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) and with the measured meson mass differences @xmath41 @xcite , contraints over flavor space have been computed .",
    "reference @xcite considers that the addition between sm and the new contribution does not exceed the experimental values , @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 gev , by more than two standard deviations for @xmath44 and @xmath40 systems .",
    "this procedure impose upper bounds on @xmath45 and @xmath46 yukawa couplings .",
    "moreover for @xmath47 and @xmath48 systems , in order to obtain the upper bounds on @xmath49 and @xmath50 it is required that only the 2hdm contribution does not exceed the experimetal values , @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev , by more than two standard deviations . for a mass degenerate spectrum in neutral scalar and pseudoscalar",

    "under the use of a general expansion of partial waves , unitarity constraints over fermionic scattering processes were obtained .",
    "the method relies on a diagonalization ( at least partial ) in the angular momentum basis of the @xmath55 matrix for the scattering of two particles in the center of mass frame and the appropriate choice of helicity states . in the helicity formalism",
    ", the spin degrees of freedom of the particle involved do not introduce any significant complication with respect to spinless particles , at least when @xmath56 ( initial helicities ) and @xmath57 ( final helicities ) .",
    "in fact , this particular case recovers the traditional partial wave expansion as well as its unitary conditions over the coefficients expansion .",
    "this leads to build up a well grounded formalism in order to impose the unitary constraints over spin @xmath58 states or in general states of any spin .    due to the universality deviation by the presence of fcnc vertices for fermionic interactions with scalars in the type iii 2hdm ,",
    "this formalism is applied in all its generality to get unitary constraints over yukawa couplings values under cheng and sher parametrization .",
    "the constraints obtained are indeed independent of other parameters of the higgs sector , i.e. the scalar masses and mixing angles . such constraints only depend on the fermionic masses which are input parameters .",
    "in the case of elastic scattering processes , diagonal yukawa couplings constraints ( coming from @xmath59 ) are more stringent that non - diagonal couplings ( coming from @xmath60 ) .",
    "in addition , these unitarity limits compete with those imposed from perturbative interactions , which could introduce more parameters .",
    "moreover , our limitations compete with current phenomenological constraints ( @xmath61 mixing , @xmath62 factor ) for heavy fermionic masses , e.g. the top mass .",
    "it is worthwhile emphasizing that the phenomenological constraints demand the use of several parameters like scalar masses or mixing angles .",
    "further , those computations lie on two - loop radiative corrections to the physical processes unlike the unitary constraints , which unfold naturally at the tree level .",
    "finally , this systematic might be extrapolated to other fermionic sectors such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model , minimal @xmath63 extension of the sm , the sm with fourth generations , etc .",
    "we consider scattering amplitudes of the type @xmath64 by means of the helicity formalism when @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "feynman diagrams for these processes are displayed in fig .",

    "other channels just differ by a minus sign .",
    "this fact is not relevant for the computation of unitarity bounds since they depend on the @xmath106 partial wave norm .                  which reproduce the amplitude for scalars with cp - even states ( [ am1 ] ) .",
    "another combinations for helicity states also satisfy these properties .",
