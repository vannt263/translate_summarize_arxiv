    "<S> these fluctuations translate directly into those of the detector s output , so the errors at high signals are proportional to the signal .    in view of this analysis </S>",

    "<S> [ singleslitfig](b ) ] , the signal s spatial structure is a speckle pattern , changing in time as we move the library card . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the signal field in the mode being detected is then governed by thermal statistics , so large fluctuations , whose magnitude is on the scale of the signal , are present even for large signals . while the effect of these fluctuations is reduced due to averaging , it is still the dominant source of error for high signal powers . for low signal powers , similarly to the coherent case , the contribution to the uncertainty associated with non - constant mode matching between the signal and lo becomes significant . </S>",
    "<S> the general behavior of the experimental error is therefore still consistent with @xmath43 , albeit with different values of @xmath44 and @xmath48 compared to the coherent case . </S>",

    "<S> the error analysis for this setting is similar to that for a single incoherent slit and yields a minimum of @xmath51 @xmath35 m for @xmath52 mm .    </S>",

    "<S> , these images do not resolve the slits and can not be used to determine the separations . </S>",
    "<S> our technique , on the other hand , permits this determination with the precision comparable to the camera pixel size ( 7 @xmath35 m ) .    at a more quantitative level </S>",
    "<S> , the above error analysis implies that the fisher information decreases to zero , and the estimation uncertainty tends to infinity , for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common feature of both our technique and conventional imaging , arising because of a nonvanishing uncertainty in evaluating the signal at @xmath54 ( _ supplementary _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental reason for this feature in both cases is the shot noise . in practice , the limitation in our experiment is the fluctuation of the mode matching between the lo and the signal , which can be reduced by using more stable optics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the shot noise level can be reduced by using squeezing @xcite . the conventional imaging technique , on the other hand , is often limited by technical fluctuations of the electronic signal produced by individual pixels in the camera , which complicates precise measurement of minute image width variations associated with varying @xmath20 . </S>",
