    "the first experimental observation of the top quark ( @xmath0 ) by the cdf and d  collaborations at the tevatron about ten years ago  @xcite represented an impressive confirmation of the standard model ( sm ) and marked the beginning of a successful top quark physics program at the tevatron .",
    "properties of the top quark were first investigated using 110@xmath1of data at @xmath7tev collected in the run  i period between 1992 and 1996 .",
    "the top quark mass , @xmath8 , was measured in all decay topologies ( _ e.g._@xcite ) arising from @xmath9 final states .",
    "after a recent reanalysis of d  run  i data  @xcite , the collaborations updated the combined run  i value to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge of @xmath8  is of great interest for particle physics .",
    "it is a fundamental parameter of the sm , but more importantly , the extremely high mass gives the top quark particular relevance in the calculation of other sm parameters .",
    "electroweak corrections to the @xmath11 propagator introduce a quadratic dependence on the @xmath11 boson mass @xmath12  and a logarithmic dependence on the mass of the long - hypothesized but still unobserved higgs boson , @xmath13 . with the current precision level of 2.5% for @xmath8  and @xmath14 for @xmath12 , the most likely value for @xmath13  obtained from global sm fits",
    "is @xmath15 , and the upper 95% cl limit is @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "a more accurate determination of @xmath8  would provide the opportunity for stringent consistency tests of the sm .",
    "the precision measurement of the top quark mass is therefore a very active topic in the current physics program of cdf in run  ii .",
    "the upgraded tevatron complex started in 2001 , producing @xmath2collisions at @xmath17=1.96tev with steadily increasing instantaneous luminosities up to a record of @xmath18 ( as of the time of this report ) .",
    "the higher collision energy led to an increase of the sm production @xmath19  cross - section of  35%  @xcite .",
    "the cdf detector  @xcite underwent substantial improvements in the geometrical acceptance of the tracking and calorimeter systems as well as of the silicon vertex detector which is crucial for the identification of @xmath20-hadrons from @xmath0 decays .",
    "all @xmath19  decay modes are being investigated intensively . here",
    "we report on three recent cdf measurements of @xmath8  in the lepton plus jets channel using 162@xmath1data collected between march 2002 and september 2003 .",
    "according to the standard model , top quarks at the tevatron are mainly produced in pairs through quark - anti - quark annihilation ( 85% ) or gluon - gluon fusion ( 15% ) , followed by a prompt decay @xmath21 with a branching ratio br@xmath22 .",
    "the subsequent @xmath11 decays define the event signature . in the decay mode studied here",
    ", one @xmath11 decays into two quarks , and the other @xmath11 decays into an electron ( @xmath23 ) or a muon ( @xmath24 ) and the corresponding neutrino ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this channel has a manageable signal to background ratio @xmath26 and a satisfactory @xmath27 that is viewed as a good compromise between all available decay modes . or @xmath24 ) has @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the _ all - hadronic _ mode has @xmath30 , @xmath31 . ]",
    "the final state has a spherical topology due to @xmath19  production near threshold and is characterized by four jets , one charged lepton with high transverse energy ( @xmath32 ) , and a sizable amount of missing transverse energy ( @xmath33 ) due to the undetectable @xmath25 .",
    "top quark candidate events are selected by requiring exactly one isolated @xmath23 or @xmath24 with @xmath34gev and @xmath35gev .",
    "furthermore , at least three jets with @xmath36gev and one jet with @xmath37gev have to be present .",
    "the dlm analysis ( explained below ) requires exactly four jets with @xmath36gev .",
    "the jets must lie in the pseudo - rapidity region @xmath38 so that they are well measured by the detector . finally , one or two displaced secondary vertices ( originating from the decay of long - lived @xmath20-hadrons ) are identified by the silicon vertex detector ( `` @xmath5-tags '' ) .",
    "this requirement improves the sample purity by a factor of 3 - 4 compared to the non-@xmath5-tagged case .",
    "dominant background sources are @xmath39 and @xmath40 final states , non-@xmath11 qcd processes and events where one jet is misidentified as a @xmath5-jet .",
    "minor sources of background are @xmath41/@xmath42 , @xmath43 and single top quark ( @xmath44 ) events .",
    "the template method ( tm ) closely follows the traditional mass measurement strategy in run  i. to get the momenta of the daughter particles of the assumed initial @xmath19  configuration , the raw jet energies are corrected for detector effects and artifacts due to the limited jet cone size , as well as for hadronization and for various non-@xmath19  contributions of the same event .",
    "one part of the corrections are directly derived from the data , another part is derived using a herwig @xmath19  monte carlo  @xcite and a simulation of the cdf detector . the analysis treats the four leading @xmath32  jets as quark jets from the @xmath19  system .",
    "the event reconstruction is complicated by the combinatorial problem of correctly assigning these jets to the four initial partons , yielding six ( two ) solutions ( `` permutations '' ) for the single ( double ) @xmath5-tag case .",
    "the number of solutions doubles because of the twofold ambiguity of the longitudinal component of the @xmath25 momentum .        for each configuration ,",
    "an invariant top quark mass is reconstructed by minimizing a @xmath45 expression calculated using the transverse momenta of the jets , the charged lepton , and the missing energy .",
    "the @xmath45 takes into account the detector resolution as well as the decay widths of the @xmath0 and the @xmath11 , and also incorporates various kinematic constraints ( _ e.g. _  @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "the solution with the smallest @xmath45 value is taken as the `` reconstructed top mass '' of the candidate event .",
    "this quantity is used to build templates for signal monte carlo samples with varying generated @xmath8 but also for various background samples .",
    "the signal templates are parametrized by continuous functions of @xmath48 .",
    "the templates serve as probability densities to be compared with the data in order to derive a top quark mass probability for each event .",
    "the most likely value for @xmath8  is extracted using an unbinned likelihood fit that maximizes the joint probability density (= product of all event - by - event probability densities ) for the whole sample of reconstructed masses .",
    "it also includes a background fraction constraint .    with a sample of 28 candidate events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tm ] ) and @xmath49 expected background events  @xcite the method yields @xmath50 .",
    "the systematic error is dominated by uncertainties of the jet energy scale ( @xmath51 ) which mainly arises from the calibration of the cdf calorimeter to a uniform response and setting the absolute jet energy scale .",
    "the multivariate  template  method ( mtm ) has three main features : 1 ) the jet energy scale ( jes ) is adjusted event - by - event .",
    "2 ) three types of signal templates are used to handle the combinatorial problem .",
    "3 ) other kinematic variables , in addition to @xmath8 , are used to improve s / b discrimination .",
    "the method performs the same generic jet corrections as tm but uses a refined kinematic fitter for the event reconstruction .",
    "in particular it includes a jes factor calibrated by the reconstruction of the @xmath52 decay using a @xmath11 mass constraint . on average",
    "this partially compensates for systematic jes shifts but also increases the statistical error because of event - by - event fluctuations of the jes .",
    "the fitter contains a jes constraint which allows the balance of jes systematics _ vs._statistical uncertainties .",
    "further kinematic constraints similar to tm are imposed . only the neutrino solution for which the @xmath0 and @xmath53 masses are",
    "closest is taken .",
    "three signal templates are used to handle jet - parton combinatorics : correct permutation samples , incorrect permutation samples , and incorrect jet assignment samples ( where _ e.g. _  a gluon jet is assigned to a quark ) .",
    "it can be shown that the knowledge of the event template type improves the mass resolution by a factor of @xmath54 in an ideal scenario with no background .",
    "mtm attempts to predict the correct permutation probability by using the differences between the smallest @xmath45 and the @xmath45 values of the other permutations , and by using kinematic information with weak @xmath8  dependence , specifically the angle between the lepton and @xmath5-quark in the @xmath55 rest frame , and @xmath19  spin correlation variables .",
    "these probabilities are used to weight the signal templates accordingly .",
    "in addition to the reconstructed top quark mass , further kinematic variables with high s / b separation power are used to construct multidimensional templates . from studies of various histogram divergence measures",
    "it turns out that the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the four leading jets ( @xmath56 ) is a promising variable to distinguish signal from noise .",
    "the templates are generated using kernel density estimation  @xcite , a non - parametric density reconstruction technique particularly suited for multivariate densities .",
    "the top quark mass likelihood is expressed in terms of multivariate probability densities for signal and background and considers the three types of signal templates .",
    "the background fraction is allowed to float freely .",
    "the jes constraint is optimized w.r.t .",
    "the expected total error . a maximum likelihood method applied to a sample of 33 selected events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mtm ] ) yields @xmath57 and a most probable background fraction of @xmath58 .",
    "for the data and for signal and background expectation . ]      the dynamical  likelihood  method ( dlm ) is an original cdf method  @xcite that attempts to use the full amount of information about the @xmath19  process provided by the standard model . the top quark mass likelihood @xmath59 for the @xmath60 event is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the parton momenta and @xmath63 denotes jet observables .",
    "@xmath64 is the parton distribution function for the incoming partons , and @xmath65 is the probability that the @xmath19system has received a transverse momentum @xmath66  due to initial state radiation .",
    "the matrix element @xmath67 for the @xmath19production and decay process is linked to the four - jet configuration using transfer functions @xmath68 ( tf ) .",
    "these are bayesian probabilities that a @xmath19  parton configuration @xmath62 with a given @xmath8  was generated when @xmath63 was reconstructed .",
    "the tfs are functions of @xmath69 and parametrized in jet @xmath32  and @xmath70 bins .",
    "they are calculated for @xmath11 or @xmath5 jets separately using a herwig @xmath19  mc for a fixed top quark mass .",
    "dlm performs some of the jet corrections as tm and mtm ( _ e.g._relative calorimeter response , calorimeter to particle correction ) , while it handles the transition from partons to particles via tfs .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath71 sums _ all _ permutations and neutrino solutions .",
    "the most likely top quark mass is obtained by maximizing @xmath72 .",
    "the joint negative log likelihood curve extracted from a sample of 22 selected events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlm ] .",
    "it should be noted that the likelihood considers only the signal but not the background matrix elements .",
    "the background contribution is hence minimized by requiring exactly four jets .",
    "residual background effects , but also the top quark mass dependence of the tfs , are taken into account by applying an mc - based correction ( `` mapping '' function ) to the maximum likelihood mass .",
    "using @xmath73 expected background events , this method yields @xmath74 .",
    "three recent cdf measurements of the top quark mass have been performed in the @xmath19  lepton plus jets channel using 162@xmath1of tevatron run  ii data .",
    "the results are @xmath75 ( tm ) , @xmath76 ( mtm ) , and @xmath77 ( dlm ) .. ] the systematic error is dominated by jet energy uncertainties .",
    "mtm allows for an optimal compromise between statistical and systematic errors and will be more powerful at higher accumulated luminosity .",
    "the dlm result has a considerably less statistical uncertainty than the other methods and is competitive with the best cdf run  i measurement  @xcite .",
    "tevatron is performing well and is expected to provide 400@xmath1  by the end of 2004 , 1@xmath78  by the end of 2005 , and 4.4 - 8.5@xmath78by the end of run  ii , thus leading to a significant improvement of the statistical error .",
    "a priority is the reduction of the jet energy systematics .",
    "the stated cdf goal for the total error is @xmath79 .",
    "substantial progress is expected soon , _",
    "e.g. _  due to recent developments in the calorimeter simulation .",
    "furthermore there is a substantial potential to refine the analyses . through these measurements , cdf has established techniques that will provide a precise determination of the top quark mass in the future .    9 f.  abe _ et al .",
