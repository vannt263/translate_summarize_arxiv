    "the study of the nuclear medium composed of different fractions of protons and neutrons has been developed for long time and it has concentrated a renewed interest in the last years . the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is a subject of particularly intense research @xcite .",
    "the possible applications range from the structure of radiative nuclei , the dynamics of rare isotopes and the cooling process of neutron stars . a key role in many of these calculations",
    "is played by the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite , which may be extracted from recent isospin diffusion data in heavy ion collisions experiences @xcite .",
    "+ the standard theoretical calculations have used as the relevant degrees of freedom protons and neutrons , moving non - relativistically through potentials representing the averaged instantaneous interaction among nucleons . furthermore , since the development of the quantum hadro - dynamics @xcite , it has became a common practice to use relativistic hadronic fields in these kind of calculations .",
    "in such a case the nuclear interaction is mediated by mesons of scalar or vector isospin character .",
    "the role of the scalar isovector meson ( @xmath0 ( 980 ) ) has been emphasized in recent investigations @xcite .",
    "a further step has been given by models incorporating the quark structure of hadrons .",
    "they may be reduced to mean field hadronic pictures whose parameters , such as masses and vertices , hide the quark dynamics .",
    "these effective models provide both a connection between the hadronic phenomenology and the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , besides a sound description of hadronic matter and atomic nuclei .    among the dual quark - hadron theoretical frameworks , those based on the bag models include explicitly the quark confinement volume . specifically , the quark meson coupling ( qmc ) @xcite states the dynamical evolution of this confining region , which depends on the global properties of the nuclear medium as well as on the configuration of the hadronic fields .",
    "however , this feature is usually missed @xcite in passing to a pure hadronic context , as baryons and mesons are regarded as point - like particles in this limit .",
    "+ the relevance of the finite extension of nucleons in the evaluation of some nuclear statistical properties has been stressed long time ago @xcite . in order to fulfill this assertion ,",
    "several corrections have been introduced in the hadronic interactions , mainly invoking a van der waals - like normalization @xcite .",
    "the motivation for such a procedure is to parameterize in compact form the strong baryon - baryon repulsion at very short distances . in the high density realm of nuclear matter the mean free path of nucleons is comparable to the quark confining size , hence excluded volume effects become relevant .",
    "+ the correction due to the finite extension of nucleons have been introduced into the hadronic sector of the bag models @xcite , it was found that it is necessary to describe properly high density hadronic matter without violating the model assumptions @xcite .",
    "another theoretical scheme suitable to describe the nuclear collective phenomena is the landau theory of fermi liquids .",
    "although it was originally stated in a non - relativistic fashion , see for instance @xcite , it was subsequently extended to deal with the relativistic fields formalism @xcite .",
    "the landau parameters are useful to evaluate thermodynamical properties , the stability conditions in phase transitions , the nuclear matter collective excitations which couple , for instance , to the weak interaction governing the neutrino emission of urca processes in neutron stars .    in this work the behaviour of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter",
    "is studied in the framework of the qmc model with excluded volume corrections in the hadronic sector .",
    "special attention is paid to the landau parameters and the collective modes . in the next section",
    "we give a resume of the qmc model and we describe the correlations generated by the van der waals - like normalization . in section 3",
    "we define the landau parameters and use them in section 4 to derive the isoscalar and isovector collective modes .",
    "results and discussions are presented in section 5 , and finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "qmc is an effective model of the quark structure of hadrons , it is inspired in the mit bag model , so that in its starting point the confinement mechanism has being accomplished and chiral symmetry has been broken . in order to describe the dynamics of the emerging hadrons , usually the model is projected into a picture of point - like baryons interacting through virtual mesons @xcite , the same ones which couple quarks inside the confinement region . since we are primarily concerned with isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , we only consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 flavor of quarks coupled by the isovector @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath0 ( 980 ) ) mesons , besides the commonly used iso - scalar @xmath5 and @xmath6 ones .",
    "+ within the qmc model baryons are represented as non - overlapping spherical bags containing three valence quarks ; the bag radius changes dynamically with the fields configuration .",
    "+ the mean field approximation ( mfa ) is the natural scheme of solution , which replaces the meson fields by its classical expectation values .",
    "these mean values determine the nucleon fields , which in turn become the source of the meson ones .",
    "+ in the mfa the dirac equation for a quark of flavor @xmath7 , of current mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 third isospin component , is given by @xcite    @xmath10    here the notation @xmath11 is used .",

    "+ in this model the ground state bag energy is identified with the baryonic mass @xmath23 ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the number of quarks of flavor @xmath26 inside the bag .",
    "the bag constant @xmath27 is numerically adjusted to get definite values for the proton bag radius , and the zero - point motion parameters @xmath28 are fixed to reproduce the baryon spectrum at zero density . + the dispersion relation for the b - baryon is @xmath29 for particle @xmath30 and antiparticle @xmath31 solutions . within the mfa at zero temperature only the particle solutions contribute . in this expression",
    "we have assumed that the strength of the couplings does not depend on the quark flavor .",

    "the spatial dependence of all the meson fields can be neglected , so that its equations of motion reduce in the mfa to @xmath34 here @xmath35 stands for the mean value of the nucleon current density of isospin @xmath13 . in the reference frame where the averaged momentum of matter is zero",
    "the spatial components of the currents become null @xmath36 , hence only the time - like projections of the vector mesons are non - zero .",

    "this result reflects the balance of the internal pressure of the bag with the baryonic contribution to the total external pressure , represented by the left and right sides of eq.([qmcc ] ) , respectively .",
    "+ the factor @xmath49 will be redefined below where excluded volume effects will be considered .",
    "the qmc model heavily relies on the assumption of non - overlapping bags , using this criterion an upper density limit around three times the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter has been found @xcite . in order to properly take into account this severe restriction ,",
    "a simplified model was introduced in @xcite , which describe baryons as extended objects . since",
    "finite size baryons are assumed non - overlapping , their motion must be restricted to the available space @xmath50 defined as @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 the total number of baryons of class @xmath13 inside the volume @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the effective volume per baryon of this class .",
    "the last mentioned quantity is proportional to the actual baryon volume , i.e. for spherical volumes of radius @xmath12 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a real number ranging from @xmath57 , in the low density limit , to @xmath58 , which corresponds to the maximum density allowed for non overlapping spheres , in a face centered cubic arrange .",
    "since we wish to study the high density regime of homogeneous isotropic matter , we shall adopt @xmath59 in all our calculations .",
    "consequently it was assumed that the nucleon fields can be normalized replacing @xmath50 for @xmath53 , which in turn implies a normalization of the nucleon densities ( [ scaldens ] ) , ( [ vecdens ] ) and of the nucleon contribution to the energy ( [ energy ] ) .",

    "+ concerning the velocity of propagation , a rough @xmath225 increment in the cc results for @xmath222 are observed in the high density domain as compared to the nc ones . as an artifact of the approximation used to solve the landau s kinetic equation , it is found that @xmath222 approaches the velocity of light at densities @xmath226 , in the cc approach .",
    "however , for such high densities the dissipative effects are non - negligible , resulting in a more involved dynamics which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamical properties and collective modes of cold asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this has been performed within a model of structured nucleons , taking into account an appropriate normalization of the nucleon fields to prevent overlapping of the quark confining regions at high densities @xcite .",
    "many body properties of hadronic matter are interpreted in a fermi liquid picture with quasiparticles and collective modes .",
    "+ within this framework the relativistic landau parameters for iso - asymmetric nuclear matter have been evaluated , and an explicit relation with the nuclear compressibility @xmath96 and symmetry energy @xmath97 has been obtained .",
    "the overall trend of excluded volume correlations at densities @xmath227 is to develop an stiffer equation of state , relative to the case where they are absent .",
    "+ different quantities such as density dependence of the symmetry energy , its slope , and the asymmetry compressibility @xmath228 have been evaluated , obtaining qualitative agreement with empirical estimates .",
    "+ it is argued that short range hadronic correlations in the dense medium preceding the deconfinement phase transition , which has been parametrized in the present work as excluded volume corrections , contribute to understand the high neutron star mass measured recently .",
    "+ we have also applied the present formalism to the landau s collisionless kinetic equation for small fluctuations around the fermi level .",
    "we have obtained the eigenvalue equation for instability and zero sound modes within this scheme , and have discussed the propagation of these modes in the dense hadronic medium .",
    "+ the behavior of collective excitations can have important consequences in heavy ion reactions , where the formation of fragments is chiefly governed by isoscalar fluctuations .",
