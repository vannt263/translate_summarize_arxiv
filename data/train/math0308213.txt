    "theorem [ thp ] improves this bound to @xmath42 for some positive constant @xmath43 .",
    "one ingredient needed for the proof of theorem [ ths ] is a result concerning the exponent of maximal torsion cosets on a variety ( theorem [ th - mbound ] ) , which may be of independent interest .    to end the introduction",

    "there are two main ingredients in the proof of theorem [ ths ] .",
    "the first is a new construction for salem numbers , which uses pairs of polynomials whose zeros interlace on the unit circle .",
    "it is an extension of the salem number construction method used in @xcite , where the interlacing polynomials arose from star - like trees .",
    "this new construction produces a polynomial of any specified negative trace that is , up to a possible cyclotomic factor , the minimal polynomial of a salem number ( or a reciprocal pisot number ) .",
    "the purpose of the second ingredient is to get rid of the possibility of a cyclotomic factor , while at the same time bounding the degree of the salem number .",
    "it is based on ideas of schmidt @xcite , and gives an upper bound for the exponent of a maximal torsion coset on a variety .",
    "this result is applied to a particular hypersurface to prove that the parameters in our polynomial construction can be chosen so that the polynomial in fact has no cyclotomic factor .",
    "this gives us our salem number of the specified trace , with a bound on its degree .",
    "[ interlace - l ] suppose that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 then @xmath50 can be written as @xmath51    further , the equation @xmath52 has real roots @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "also @xmath55 if and only if @xmath56 .",

    "the lower bound @xmath349 for the trace of a degree @xmath350 salem number follows from the fact that the trace of a totally positive algebraic integer of degree @xmath351 is greater than @xmath352 ( @xcite ) on noting that for a salem number @xmath9 of degree @xmath40 and trace @xmath3 , the number @xmath46 is totally positive of degree @xmath353 and trace @xmath354 .",
    "thus ( turning the inequality around ) for @xmath355 every salem number of trace @xmath3 has degree at least @xmath356 this inequality is sharp for @xmath334 ( @xcite )",

    "<S> the proof has two main ingredients . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a novel construction , using pairs of polynomials whose zeros interlace on the unit circle , of polynomials of specified negative trace having one factor a salem polynomial , with any other factors being cyclotomic . </S>",
    "<S> the second is an upper bound for the exponent of a maximal torsion coset of an algebraic torus in a variety defined over the rationals . </S>",
    "<S> this second result , which may be of independent interest , enables us to refine our construction to avoid getting cyclotomic factors , giving a salem polynomial of any specified trace , with a trace - dependent bound for its degree .    </S>",
    "<S> we show also how our interlacing construction can be easily adapted to produce pisot polynomials , giving a simpler , and more explicit , construction for pisot numbers of arbitrary trace than previously known . </S>"
