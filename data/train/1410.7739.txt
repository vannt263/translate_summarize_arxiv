    "anisotropic flow , @xmath0 , is one of the most striking observations in nucleus - nucleus collisions at ultrarelativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "it is an azimuthal asymmetry of particle production , which is interpreted as a signature of the system s hydrodynamic response to the initial density profile of the overlap zone of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the anisotropic flow thus provides a handle on the important issue of thermalization of the quark - gluon matter formed in these collisions .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of the initial density profile have long been recognized to play a crucial role in the interpretation of elliptic flow @xmath1  @xcite and they are solely responsible for triangular flow @xmath2  @xcite . however , the methods used to analyze anisotropic flow , namely the event - plane method  @xcite and cumulants  @xcite , were devised before the importance of fluctuations was recognized .",
    "there are several discussions in the literature of how the existing methods are affected by flow fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we present a new method which unlike previous methods extracts the flow fluctuations directly from data by fully exploiting all the information contained in two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "it also reveals an event - by - event substructure in flow fluctuations whose various components are organized by size thereby isolating the most important fluctuations .",
    "these can be systematically analyzed by model calculations thus providing additional constraints on the initial - state dynamics .",
    "the flow picture is that particles are emitted independently with an underlying probability distribution which varies event to event  @xcite . in each event",
    "we write the single - particle distribution with @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of the outgoing particle momentum , @xmath6 is a complex fourier flow coefficient whose magnitude and phase fluctuate event to event , and @xmath7 is a shorthand notation for the remaining momentum coordinates , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is real and corresponds to the momentum distribution , and @xmath11 .",
    "note that the usual definition of anisotropic flow @xmath0 is real and normalized : @xmath12 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the flow harmonics @xmath6 can be measured from the distribution of particle pairs .",
    "specifically , in the flow picture the pair distribution is determined ( predominantly ) by the statistics of the event - by - event single particle distribution = + o ( n ) , where angular brackets denote an average over events , and the term @xmath13 corresponds to correlations not due to flow ( `` nonflow '' ) , which are small for large systems .",
    "if the pair distribution is also expanded in a fourier series @xmath14 then the measured series coefficients @xmath15 are determined by the statistics of @xmath16 : [ covariance ] v_n(p_1 , p_2 ) = v_n(p_1 ) v_n^*(p_2 ) , where we have neglected nonflow correlations .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ covariance ] ) is a covariance matrix , hence it is positive semidefinite .",
    "thus a nontrivial property of flow correlations is that the measured pair correlation matrix @xmath17 has only non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "@xcite , hence negative eigenvalues . ]",
    "the current letter uses the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the two - particle correlation matrix , @xmath18 , to fully classify flow fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "specifically , we show how a principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite of @xmath18 can be used to fully extract information on the pseudorapidity and transverse - momentum - dependence of flow fluctuations .",
    "we first test the applicability of the method with monte - carlo simulations using the transport model ampt  @xcite in both rapidity and transverse - momentum .",
    "in addition to the leading eigenmode , corresponding to the usual anisotropic flow ( for @xmath19 ) , the correlation analysis reveals at least one important subleading mode in both rapidity and @xmath20 for the momentum distribution and its second and third harmonics",
    ". then we analyze alice data  @xcite in transverse - momentum and determine the first subleading elliptic and triangular flow coefficients .",
    "divide the detector acceptance into @xmath21 bins in transverse momentum and/or pseudorapidity , @xmath22 .",
    "the sample estimate for @xmath6 in a given event ( usually referred to as the flow vector  @xcite ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of particles in the bin and @xmath25 is the azimuthal angle of a particle .",
    "the pair distribution is @xmath26 where the second term of the right - hand side subtracts self - correlations  @xcite .",
    "if self - correlations are not subtracted , @xmath18 is positive semidefinite by construction .",
    "after subtraction , eigenvalues may have both signs .",
    "however , the eigenvalues will be positive if the correlations are due to collective flow .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ defvndelta ] ) subtracts the mean value in order to single out the fluctuations . for @xmath19 and an azimuthally symmetric detector ,",
    "this term vanishes by azimuthal symmetry . for an asymmetric detector , subtracting the mean value corrects for azimuthal anisotropies in the acceptance  @xcite note that we define @xmath18 as a _ sum _ over all pairs , as opposed to the usual normalization  @xcite where one _ averages _ over pairs in each bin . , and is desirable for @xmath27 because it gives weight to a bin that is of the order of the number of particles in it .",
    "note that a similar normalization is now used in cumulant analyses of anisotropic flow , where it is better to give all pairs ( or generally multiplets ) the same weight  @xcite . ]",
    "the principal component analysis approximates the pair distribution as : @xmath28 where each term in the sum corresponds to a different component ( mode ) of flow fluctuations , and @xmath29 . if there are no flow fluctuations , the pair distribution @xmath18 factorizes  @xcite and there is only one component , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ pca ] ) , corresponding to the usual anisotropic flow .",
    "flow fluctuations break factorization  @xcite .",
    "higher - order principal components then reveal information about the statistics and momentum dependence of flow fluctuations .    in practice ,",
    "the principal components are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 denotes the normalized eigenvector ) and ordering eigenvalues @xmath33 from largest to smallest , @xmath34 . identifying with eq .",
    "( [ pca ] ) , one obtains @xmath35 because of the square root , eigenvalues must be positive .",
    "if parity is conserved , the correlation matrix @xmath18 is real up to statistical fluctuations , and @xmath36 can be chosen to be real .",
    "the flow in a given event can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are complex , uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and unit variance , that is , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the rms magnitude and momentum dependence of flow fluctuations are determined by the corresponding properties of the principal components . since eigenmodes are real , the azimuthal angle of anisotropic flow in a specific event is solely determined by the phases of @xmath38 .    for sake of compatibility with the usual definition of @xmath41 which is the anisotropy per particle",
    ", we define @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 describe relative multiplicity fluctuations , while @xmath44 describe fluctuations of anisotropic flow .",
    "in order to illustrate the method , we analyze @xmath45 pb - pb collisions at @xmath46  tev in the 0 - 10% centrality range , generated using the string - melting version of the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "initial conditions are generated via the hijing 2.0 model  @xcite which contains nontrivial event - by - event fluctuations at the nucleonic and partonic levels @xcite . in ampt ,",
    "collective flow is generated mainly as a result of partonic cascade .",
    "ampt also has resonance formations and decays , and thus contains non - flow effects .",
    "we have checked that the present implementation reproduces lhc data for anisotropic flow ( @xmath1 to @xmath47 ) at all centralities  @xcite .",
    "we first construct the pair distribution , eq .",
    "( [ defvndelta ] ) , for all particles in the @xmath48 pseudorapidity window , in @xmath9 bins of @xmath49 .",
    "we then diagonalize the @xmath50 matrix corresponding to these pseudorapidity bins .",
    "the eigenvalues are in general strongly ordered from largest to smallest .",
    "there are a few negative eigenvalues which can be attributed to statistical fluctuations . , and found that the negative eigenvalues of @xmath18 are compatible with the negative eigenvalues of these random matrices . ]",

    "]    the leading principal components for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are shown in fig .",
    "[ eta ] ( a ) displays the principal modes of multiplicity fluctuations ( @xmath51 ) as a function of pseudorapidity .",
    "the leading mode @xmath54 is a global @xmath55 relative fluctuation , independent of @xmath9 , corresponding to the fluctuation of the total multiplicity within the event sample .",
    "the next - to - leading mode @xmath56 is odd and of much smaller amplitude , as shown by the eigenvalues , @xmath57 .",
    "a natural source of this odd mode is the small difference between the participant numbers of projectile and target nuclei induced by fluctuations , which creates a forward - backward asymmetry of the multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "since both the colliding system and the analysis window are symmetric around @xmath58 , principal components have definite parity in @xmath9 , up to statistical fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the next mode @xmath59 is even , suggesting that principal components typically have alternating parities .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is again much smaller , @xmath60 . @xmath61 and",
    "higher modes are blurred by statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ pca ] ) defines principal components up to a sign . here , we conventionally choose @xmath62 at forward rapidity .",

    "the leading modes @xmath66 correspond to the usual elliptic and triangular flows , which depend weakly on @xmath9 at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the subleading modes @xmath67 are odd and of smaller amplitude ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these rapidity - odd harmonic flows , or torqued flows , can be attributed to the small relative angle between @xmath69-th harmonic participant planes defined in the projectile and target nuclei  @xcite .",
    "note that the correlation matrix @xmath70 is the sum of flow and nonflow correlations  @xcite .",
    "the nonflow correlation is significant only for small values of the relative pseudorapidity @xmath71 .",
    "if the range in @xmath72 is smaller than the binning , it contributes to the diagonal elements , and its effect is to shift all eigenvalues by a constant .",
    "we observe in general a clear ordering of eigenvalues ( @xmath73 ) which suggests that the correlation has a long range in @xmath74 and is therefore dominated by flow .",
    "visual inspection of correlation matrix @xmath70 qualitatively confirms this reasoning .",
    "we then carry out the analysis as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "in addition to ampt generated events , we use experimental data for @xmath18 provided by the alice collaboration  @xcite for pb+pb collisions in the 0 - 10% centrality window .",
    "alice uses all charged particles in the pseudorapidity window @xmath75 .",
    "the definition of @xmath15 is not quite the same as ours : first , it is averaged ( as opposed to summed ) over pairs .",
    "we correct for this difference by multiplying off - diagonal elements of @xmath15 of alice by the average multiplicity of pairs in each @xmath76 bin , which we estimate using the statistical errors provided by alice ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the diagonal elements are multiplied by twice the average multiplicity of the pairs , to account for self - correlations .",
    "second , the analysis is done with a rapidity gap to suppress nonflow correlations : this means that particles 1 and 2 in eq .",
    "( [ defvndelta ] ) are separated by a rapidity gap of @xmath78 . for sake of comparison",
    ", we repeat the analysis using ampt events ( the same as in fig .",
    "[ eta ] ) . in order to compensate for the lower statistics , we use a wider pseudorapidity window , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , with a @xmath78 rapidity gap between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "tev in the 0 - 10% centrality window , using alice data  @xcite ( full symbols ) and ampt events ( open symbols ) . ( a ) multiplicity fluctuations ; ( b ) elliptic flow fluctuations ; ( c ) triangular flow fluctuations . ]    fig .",
    "[ pt ] ( a ) displays the two principal modes of multiplicity fluctuations ( @xmath51 ) as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "since no experimental data are available for this analysis , we only use ampt events . as in fig .",
    "[ eta ] ( a ) , the leading mode is essentially constant and corresponds to the 12% fluctuation in the total multiplicity .",
    "the subleading mode increases linearly as a function of @xmath20 for large @xmath20 , which can be interpreted as the result of a radial flow fluctuation .",
    "specifically , in a hydrodynamic model the number of particles at high @xmath20 decreases as , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the maximum fluid 4-velocity , @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the temperature  @xcite .",
    "a small variation in @xmath84 therefore produces a relative variation in the yield increasing linearly with @xmath20 .",
    "[ pt ] ( b ) and ( c ) display the two leading principal components for elliptic and triangular flows .",
    "alice data show a very strong ordering between the two leading eigenvalues ( @xmath87 for @xmath52 , @xmath88 for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the leading components for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are very close to the value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained using the same data  @xcite .",
    "the subleading mode is of much smaller magnitude and becomes significant only at large transverse momentum . in a hydrodynamical model ,",
    "such a behavior is expected .",
    "indeed , in a typical event the phase angle of the harmonic flow at high - momentum deviates slightly from the phase angle at low - momentum  @xcite .",
    "thus , the flow of high-@xmath20 particles has a small component independent of the flow of low-@xmath20 particles .",
    "the subleading mode determines the magnitude of this additional component .",
    "as we shall see below , it is also responsible for the factorization breaking of azimuthal correlations observed in these data  @xcite .",
    "this new method , unlike traditional analysis methods , makes use of _ all _ the information contained in two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "specifically , it uses the detailed information on how they depend on the momenta of _ both _ particles , as opposed to traditional analyses which integrate over one of the momenta .",
    "previously , this double - differential structure has been used to test the factorization of azimuthal correlations .",
    "small factorization breaking effects have been seen experimentally  @xcite and in event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "they have been characterized by the pearson correlation coefficient between two different momenta : @xmath89 @xmath90 if correlations factorize , and @xmath91 in general if correlations are due to flow .",
    "these results are easily recovered in the language of principal components , in a physically transparent way .",
    "factorization is the limiting case of just one principal component ( @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ pca ] ) ) . in the more general case @xmath92 ,",
    "( [ pca ] ) guarantees @xmath91 : cauchy - schwarz inequalities  @xcite are equivalent to the condition that all eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath15 are positive .",
    "flow fluctuations are typically dominated by a single subleading mode , i.e. , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . in this limit , eq .",
    "( [ rn ] ) gives @xmath95 we see that @xmath96 as required by the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "further , we see that the breaking of factorization is induced by the relative difference between the subleading mode and the leading mode .    to summarize",
    ", we have presented a new method to analyze the anisotropic flow data in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is based on the principal component analysis applied to the two - particle correlation matrix .",
    "the principal components express the detailed information contained in correlations in a convenient way , which can be directly compared with model calculations .",
    "the method has revealed for the first time subleading modes in both rapidity and @xmath20 in the harmonic coefficients for @xmath97 and 3 .",
