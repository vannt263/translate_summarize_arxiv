    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) resulting in the population transfer between the states which are not directly coupled @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) via adiabatic following of the dark , non - absorbing state @xcite , nonresonant pulse excitation of the two - level atom @xcite are just a short list of phenomena in quantum optics where adiabatic processes are considered .",
    "generally , one can find in any part of physics problems concerned with adiabaticity , which are treated almost similarly . among them we can mention multiphoton resonances induced in atoms and molecules by a strong low - frequency field @xcite-@xcite , wave - packet dynamics in physics and chemistry or , so - called ,  femto - chemistry  @xcite-@xcite and slow atomic and molecular collisions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a fully adiabatic process takes place if the hamiltonian of the problem is diagonal .",
    "then any time dependence of this diagonal hamiltonian does not change the state of the quantum system except its phase .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian , describing the interacting systems , has both diagonal and nondiagonal components . in most cases dealing with adiabatic excitation , the problem can be reduced to the consideration of the two - level system perturbed by the diagonal and nondiagonal interactions .",
    "then , both components of the hamiltonian , i.e. , the two - level splitting and the nondiagonal perturbation , are time dependent .",
    "one can find instantaneous eigenstates of such a hamiltonian .",
    "these states are called adiabatic states if the system , being initially in one of them , follows this state .",
    "in contrast , the initial states , where the transition takes place , are called diabatic states .",
    "the diagonalization of the instantaneous hamiltonian takes into account the diabatic states coupling , incorporating the interaction parameter into the instantaneous eigenvalues .",
    "however , a new coupling appears again because of the time dependence of the transformation from the initial , diabatic basis to the adiabatic basis ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "inasmuch as the coupling between instantaneous eigenstates does not vanish , the following of the adiabatic states can never be perfect .",
    "since it is almost impossible to get rid of the state coupling by the time dependent transformation of the basis functions , the choice of the adiabatic basis is aimed to minimize the transition probability between the states , almost approaching in this sense to the fully adiabatic hamiltonian ( i.e. , the diagonal one ) when the coupling can be neglected .",
    "the estimation of the fraction of the system that is transferred from one adiabatic state to another during the interaction ( nonadiabatic correction ) is a main problem in this approach .",
    "this nonadiabatic correction is a measure of the nonadiabaticity of the process .",
    "it should be obvious that the searching for the adiabatic basis is an approximate approach .",
    "it was developed for the first time to treat the behavior of the two - level system subject to an excitation that couples the states if both the two - level splitting and the excitation are time dependent .",
    "only a few models of such a two - level system have analytical solutions . among them",
    "are the rosen  zener model with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the demkov ",
    "kunike model with @xmath2 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 , the landau  zener model with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the parabolic model with @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "although the last model has not an exact solution , it has been studied comprehensively ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here , @xmath8 is the amplitude of the diagonal component of the hamiltonian ( i.e. , the two - level splitting ) and @xmath9 is the amplitude of the nondiagonal component ( i.e. , the coupling perturbation ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 can represent arbitrary constants and @xmath14 is time .",
    "one can find these models and their solutions in , for example , suominen95 .",
    "the advantage of these models comes from the possibility to reduce their schrdinger equations to second order differential equations ( with time dependent coefficients ) whose solutions are known .",
    "for example , the schrdinger equation for the rosen - zener model can be reduced to an equation whose solution is the hypergeometric function and the schrdinger equation for the landau - zener model can be solved in terms of parabolic cylinder functions . for an arbitrary hamiltonian ,",
    "the quasi - classical approach based on the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation was developed by dykhne @xcite@xcite . in this method",
    ", the amplitude of the nonadiabatic transition is calculated under the assumption that the adiabatic levels cross in the complex time plane and the main contribution of the nonadiabatic coupling is given at the time of the level crossing .",
    "the latter is usually the branch point of the phase integral of the energies .",
    "the result becomes universal , i.e. , independent of the nonadiabatic coupling model and it is sufficient to take the leading term of the coupling at the crossing point .",
    "in this paper we consider adiabatic following of the dark , nonabsorbing state in the three - level system excited by two resonant fields .",
    "the adiabatic following of the dark state results in stirap ( population transfer ) .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the so called counterintuitive raman pulse sequence emerged as a result of the search for the generalization of the liouville equations for the @xmath15-level system using @xmath16 coherence vector theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "this pulse sequence consists of two fields coupling two low energy levels @xmath17 and @xmath18 with one common excited state @xmath19 .",
    "if one of the levels ( for example , @xmath18 ) is initially empty , then applying first the field which couples this state with level @xmath19 , and then the field coupling the populated state ( for example , @xmath17 ) with @xmath19 , it is possible to transfer the population of state @xmath17 to state @xmath18 , without appreciably populating the intermediate state @xmath19 .    later , the importance of the adiabaticity in the counterintuitive pulse sequence development was realized in @xcite  carrhioe90 .",
    "there is a particular superposition of states @xmath17 and @xmath18 that does not interact with the coupling fields and , if the development of the field amplitudes in time is properly chosen , this superposition state changes from state @xmath17 to state @xmath18 .",
    "if the three - level atom follows this superposition state , the atom population is transferred from state @xmath17 to state @xmath18 by the pulse sequence without populating the intermediate excited state @xmath19 .",
    "this noncoupled superposition state was first introduced by arimondo @xcite to explain qualitatively the dark resonance as population trapping in this state @xcite@xcite .",
    "the noncoupled state is often referred to as a dark state .    it is obvious that , if the dark state changes in time , a process must exist which tends to empty this state .",
    "the condition minimizing the dark state depopulation is formulated in @xcite .",
    "this is done _ ad hoc _ , without an estimation of the nonadiabatic correction for the excited probability amplitude .",
    "however , numerical calculations show that , if this condition is satisfied , the adiabatic population transfer @xmath20 is almost perfect .",
    "some attempts were undertaken to find a rigorous justification of the intuitively found adiabaticity condition and to estimate the amplitude of the excited state during the stirap pulse sequence ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) . in stenholm96 ,",
    "the so called ramp pulses were considered , which allow an exact solution .",
    "furthermore , with the help of the method developed for the two - level system by dykhne ( see the discussion above and refs .",
    "pechukas76@xcite ) , the nonadiabatic amplitude of the excited state @xmath19 is estimated for gaussian and hyperbolic secant pulses .",
    "this is possible because the liouville equation for the two - level atom in terms of the @xmath21 coherence vector ( bloch - vector model , see , for example , alleneber75 ) coincides with the schrdinger equation for the state probability amplitudes of the three - level atom excited by two resonant fields ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , shakhmuratov2001 ) .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite admit that the analytical approximations for the nonadiabatic corrections  _ have been introduced ad hoc without derivation _  and they  _ would really like to see more detailed investigations of the analytic behavior of the system discussed _  .",
    "fleischhauer with coauthors @xcite developed a different approach introducing higher - order trapping states .",
    "they define a @xmath22th  order generalized adiabatic basis , which is similar to the superadiabatic basis introduced for the two - level system in @xcite@xcite . by successive transformations from the diabatic basis to the adiabatic basis , then from this adiabatic basis , which can be considered as the adiabatic basis of the first order , to the next , i.e. , the second order adiabatic basis , etc . , the solution is presented as an infinite product of transformations .",
    "the general expression for the @xmath22-th transformation matrix is presented . however , it is hard to implement this scheme for an arbitrary pulse sequence .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new method that allows us to calculate the adiabatic and nonadiabatic components of the solution with controllable accuracy .",
    "the adiabatic component describes the part of the atomic probability amplitude visiting the excited atomic state during the pulse train and coming back to the dark state when the pulses are gone .",
    "the atom evolution following the adiabatic component of the solution resembles the excitation  de - excitation process induced by a soliton in the two - level atom .",
    "the nonadiabatic component is that part which is lost from the dark state and describes the fraction of the atomic probability amplitude that is left excited after the pulse train .",
    "we compare our result with the previous theories reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found corrections to the theory presented in @xcite and show that our result corresponds to the calculation of the infinite number of transformations proposed in @xcite .",
    "as an example of the validity of the method , we present also the solution of the rosen  zener and landau - zener models by our method ( see the appendix and the end of sections vi and vii ) .",
