    "a better understanding of solar spicules is essential to unlock the mysteries of the chromosphere and low solar atmosphere .",
    "these dynamic jet - like features dominate the solar limb and since their first reports they have been challenging to explain , as attested in various reviews @xcite . over the last decades spicules",
    "have been observed in a variety of filters and instruments ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the contribution of the _ hinode _ mission @xcite has been nothing short of revolutionary . from high quality time series of spicules in the  band of the _ solar optical telescope _ ( sot , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it emerged that there are at least two types of spicules @xcite .",
    "type i spicules have a slower rise and fall ( @xmath1 ) and long lifetimes ( @xmath2 minutes ) , with a parabolic motion in space - time diagrams , while type ii spicules have a faster upward rise ( @xmath3 ) followed by a fading from the  passband after @xmath4  s ; they are not observed to fall back down ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) .",
    "type ii spicules are the most abundant ( seen in quiet sun and coronal holes ) , while type i spicules appear mostly in and around active regions .",
    "the disappearance of type ii spicules from the  passband has fueled speculation that these may be heated to higher temperatures @xcite , possibly even to transition region ( tr ) or coronal temperatures as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , establishing the thermal evolution of spicules to the higher chromosphere and tr has been difficult because the spatial and temporal resolution of previous instruments is just barely enough to resolve their rapid motions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the recently launched iris mission @xcite is aimed precisely at observing the dynamic interface between the chromosphere and corona , therefore making it ideal for the study of spicules .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide an overview of the quiet sun spicule dynamics and thermal evolution as observed with iris , comparing them with the  spicules from _ hinode_/sot and their higher temperature counterparts from the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia , * ? ? ?",
    "we make use of a series of coordinated quiet sun observations obtained with iris , _ hinode_/sot and aia , taken on 2014 february 21 . from iris",
    "we use the chromospheric and tr slit - jaw filtergrams at 279.6  nm ( dominated by , at @xmath5  kk ) and 140.0  nm ( dominated by , at @xmath6  kk under ionization equilibrium conditions ) , taken with a 19  s cadence . from sot we use the 396.85  nm filtergrams ( dominated by , at @xmath7  kk ) from the broadband filter imager , taken with a 4.8  s cadence . from aia",
    "we use the 30.4  nm filtergrams ( dominated by , at @xmath8  kk ) , taken with a 12  s cadence .",
    "the target of the observations was the quiet sun at the south pole ( no coronal hole was visible ) , and the time series duration was 91 minutes .",
    "the iris field of view was centered at @xmath9 .",
    "we made use of iris calibrated level 2 data ( for details on the reduction see * ? ? ?",
    "the sot images were reduced using the same procedure as in . for aia",
    "we used calibrated level 1.5 images ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in all iris and sot filtergrams",
    "shown we applied a radial density filter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to enhance the visibility of spicules .",
    "the iris , sot , and aia spatial resolutions are approximately @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively . the sot and aia images were aligned and interpolated to the iris pixel size of @xmath13  pix@xmath14 .    additionally , we make use of a very large dense raster observed with iris at the solar north pole on 2013 october 9 at 13:10 ut .",
    "this raster has 400 positions observed with a spatial spacing of @xmath15 and a cadence of 9  s. the raster covered about @xmath16 and took one hour to complete .",
    "the spacecraft orbital velocity and spectrograph thermal drifts were compensated by fitting the position of the  279.947 nm line and subtracting its long - term trend from the signal .",

    "( animated parts of this figure are available to download at http://folk.uio.no / tiago / iris_spic/. ) [ fig : spic_panel ] ]      in figure  [ fig : spic_panel ] we show a comparison between the iris , sot and aia filtergrams .",
    "the  spicules are seen as a natural upward extension of the  spicules .",
    "they are consistently taller and in several cases twice as tall .",
    "the  spicules show a continuation of the  spicules and expand even farther . from the lower panel of figure  [ fig : spic_panel ]",
    "one can see that the  spicules extend just above the  spicules virtually everywhere .",
    "even accounting for the different spatial resolution , the iris spicules are broader and more nebulous than in sot , where individual spicule `` strands '' are seen more clearly .    only the longest spicules are seen in the  30.4 filter , because it is opaque in higher layers that obscure the shorter spicules .",
    "spicules extend just above the  spicules and their shape is blurrier , partly because of the lower spatial resolution , and presumably in part because of the more complicated radiative transfer .",
    "many of the  spicules have a much darker bottom third or half , with the top part of the spicule noticeably brighter .",
    "this is not generally seen in  or , and indicates that the bottom part of several spicules may not be hot enough to have significant  emission .",
    "this is clearly shown in the top panels of figure  [ fig : spic_panel ] ( and in the space - time diagrams of the same spicule a in figure  [ fig : xt ] ) . here",
    ", the  emission occurs primarily in the top half of the spicule , a situation that is relatively common .",
    "the spicules observed were mostly of type ii , showing a fast rise ( @xmath17 ) and then fading from the  filtergrams . in the iris filtergrams they have a similar upward velocity but continue to rise after they fade in , reaching heights up to 20  mm above the limb and often falling down later in a parabolic motion . in several cases this rise and fall",
    "is also seen in the  30.4  nm filtergrams . in figure",
    "[ fig : spic_evo ] we show one such event where a spicule fades in  but continues to evolve in the iris and aia filters .",
    "this suggests that such spicules are being heated out of the  passband , and continue evolving reaching higher layers and temperatures .",
    "this extended evolution leads to longer spicule lifetimes in the iris images , typically @xmath0",
    "s.    , where a view of these spicules is shown.[fig : xt ] ]    the spicule in figure  [ fig : spic_evo ] is in fact a rare case of a type ii spicule that is observed to fall back down in  much later after it fades . at @xmath18",
    "s in the intensity and in the space - time diagram it is possible to discern a faint trail from a descending spicule , roughly at the same time when the spicule is observed to fall back down by iris . with only the  images it would be difficult to associate this falling material with the original spicule , but taking into account the iris images it becomes clear that this is most likely falling material that has cooled down and therefore is visible again in . in figure  [ fig : spic_evo ]",
    "there are further examples of the thermal evolution of spicules . in the first frames the later stages of a different spicule",
    "are seen on the left side of the iris and aia panels , which had already faded from the  image . at around @xmath19",
    "s a different spicule rises diagonally , towards the upper right corner .",
    "this spicule is hardly visible in but prominent in the other filters ; it is presumably undergoing more vigorous heating .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xt ] we show space - time diagrams for two other spicules , illustrating the differences in temporal evolution for different filters .",
    "again , the spicules show a clear parabolic trajectory and similar lifetimes in all filters but .",
    "spicule a shows a common evolution where  is much brighter at the top of the spicule , and towards the later stages of its life .",
    "a close look shows that a very faint outline of the near - parabolic trajectory of spicule a is also traced in .",
    "spicule b also shows more  emission near its top . in some cases",
    "the  space - time diagrams look almost like half a parabola , brightening up near the later life of the spicule and coinciding with the instant where it fades in .          in figure",
    "[ fig : raster ] we show an overview of a dense raster .",
    "positive velocities are defined as towards the observer .",
    "the  lines have the advantages of a wide formation range @xcite and a core that is much brighter than the wings . from figure",
    "[ fig : raster ] it is clear how the disk counterparts of spicules arise naturally in bushes when observed in the wings of the k line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as one observes in wavelengths closer to the line core there are more spicules per bush . at the line core",
    "there is more opacity from the chromospheric canopy and the spicule footpoints are no longer visible",
    ". dopplergrams ( constructed by subtracting red and blue wing images at the same wavelength offset ) provide a view of the spicule line - of - sight velocities ( caused by the three kinds of spicule motion : upflow / downflow , transverse , and torsional , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and how spicule numbers increase when closer to the line core .    in the middle right and bottom right panels of figure  [ fig : raster ]",
    "we show the mean properties of the k line as function of the distance to the limb .",
    "the equivalent width , integrated from 100 to @xmath20 from the line core , decreases by half of its limb value at about 4.5  mm above the limb .",
    "the  lines get broader from the disk to the limb ; the fwhm increases sharply just after the limb , peaking at @xmath21  mm above the limb and then falling steeply . in the spatially - averaged spectra",
    "the  lines are strong even at considerable distances from the limb ( here defined as zero at 280.9  nm ) .",
    "the k line shows a double peak until about 6  mm above the limb , and a single - peaked emission profile is still seen beyond 12  mm above the limb . in the insets on the middle right panel of the figure",
    "we show sample spectra from adjacent spicules , both on disk and off - limb .",
    "these spectra show the same extended wings as the rapid blue - shifted events ( rbes ) and rapid red - shifted events ( rres ) observed on disk in other lines @xcite , confirming that off - limb spicules and disk rbes / rres have the same spectral signature .    in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : raster ]",
    "we show a  133  nm slit - jaw image taken at a particular instant of the raster . because of the long exposure of the raster , not all the structures seen in the slit - jaw are co - temporal with the features in the raster . nevertheless , it is still a useful comparison .",
    "the  image shows the limb spicules and also the brighter of their disk counterparts .",
    "the fainter disk features are not resolved in the  image , but instead appear as cloudy areas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "almost all of these cloudy features appear in the same loci of the spicule bushes from the  raster .",
    "the  140  nm slit - jaw images show essentially the same . in the bottom middle panel of figure  [ fig : raster ]",
    "one can see a tr image from the red wing of the  139.39  nm line where spicules and their disk counterparts are still visible .",
    "many of such spicules are a continuation of the  spicules , in particular when seen on disk .",
    "the most obvious example is the strongest bush in the raster , at @xmath22  mm . in the  images",
    "the spicules are just below the reference line in the figure ( cyan color ) , and in  they extend more than 5  mm above the reference line . a closer look shows that the same is true for almost all spicule bushes , even though in some cases they are noticeably fainter in .",
    "iris brings a comprehensive new look into the evolution and origin of spicules .",
    "the most clear result so far is that spicules undergo thermal evolution to at least tr temperatures .",
    "the fading of type ii spicules seen by sot is not observed in the iris filtergrams , and is in some cases associated with increased emission in the  filtergrams .  and  spicules continue to rise for @xmath23 mm more , evolving for several more minutes after fading from .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that such spicules are undergoing heating and disappear from the  passband , as previously suggested @xcite .",
    "such evolution is also seen in the candidate spicule modeled by @xcite , which disappears from  and continues in tr filtergrams .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling that the spicules in  are so different from , as one would expect both elements to be predominantly doubly ionized at about the same temperatures ( @xmath24  kk , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the persistence of  while  disappears could indicate time - dependent ionization effects or may stem from the much higher opacity of the k line ( mg is about 18 times more abundant than ca , and the k line is about twice as strong as the h line ) . this warrants further investigation .",
    "the  spicules behave as one would expect with spicular heating to tr temperatures : they rise farther and are often brighter near the top .",
    "they extend above the  spicules in nearly all cases , and undergo essentially the same time evolution ( in some rare cases spicules rise and _ fade _ in  while in  they rise and _ fall _ ) . the heating to tr temperatures",
    "is confirmed by the aia 30.4  nm channel , which shows similar dynamics and evolution to the  spicules , and is also seen in the spectral diagnostics .",
    "the presence of spicules in multiple filters underscores their multi - thermal nature , while the brighter tops in  suggest heating .",
    "type ii spicules show parabolic space - time diagrams in the iris and aia filters , but should not be confused with type i spicules .",
    "the distinction between the two types made by @xcite was that type ii were faster , much shorter lived features that faded from  filtergrams .",
    "our results confirm this .",
    "in addition , we now observe that this fading from  is associated with vigorous heating to higher temperatures .",
    "the fact that type ii spicules continue evolving in the iris filtergrams does not change the fundamental differences between the two types of spicules .",
    "some studies such as @xcite claimed that all  spicules behave as type i ( i.e. , slow and do not fade from the filtergrams ) , but their results could not be reproduced by , who analyzed their datasets and instead found type ii spicules dominant in quiet sun and coronal holes .",
    "the two types should not be confused .",
    "the group behavior of spicules is clearer in the iris observations .",
    "what is often perceived as one or two spicules in sot turns out to be a much wider structure in iris ( see figure  [ fig : spic_panel ] ) . with clearly defined multiple strands , these wide bunches of spicules",
    "have the same time evolution , and extend to areas with little or no emission in .",
    "such group behavior plausibly contributes to the appearance of seemingly co - spatial spicules in lower resolution observations @xcite .",
    "it is likely that only the cooler strands of such groups become visible in .",
    "the group behavior , multi - thermal nature and apparent heating of these spicules indicate that these features are likely not driven in the same way as dynamic fibrils",
    "@xcite even if the presence of parabolic paths is suggestive of the presence of a shock wave . instead , the vigorous heating suggests some form of magnetic heating , perhaps as a result of magnetic reconnection ( as suggested by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "detailed spectra from iris rasters show that the disk counterparts of quiet sun spicules are easily seen in the wings of chromosperic and tr lines .",
    "they rise in `` bushes '' from the magnetic network as previously reported @xcite , and both the on - disk and off - limb features show the same spectral signatures as the rbes / rres ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , providing more evidence that rbes / rres are the disk counterparts of spicules .",
    "spicules as depicted by iris are complex and multifaceted .",
    "a pattern of multi - thermal spicules with vigorous heating is emerging , and will place constrains on much needed theoretical modeling .",
    "the field is ripe for further studies ."
