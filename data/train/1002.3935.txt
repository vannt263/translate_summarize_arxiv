    "there are two methods which allow to determine the equilibrium shape ( ground state ) of the nuclei : the constrained hartree - fock method and the so - called macroscopic - microscopic method . though the latest generation of computers is able to perform very complicated calculations , in terms of running time , it is no so obvious to make systematic calculations for a large number of nuclei .",
    "a good alternative is to use the strutinsky method .",
    "the latter consists of associating the classical liquid drop model with some shell and pairing corrections built from a realistic microscopic model . based on such a model",
    ", we present a numerical method with its associated fortran program .",
    "the potential energy of deformation is deduced as a function of the shape of the nucleus .",
    "triaxial ( quadrupole ) shapes are considered in this work .",
    "the three semi axes of the ellipsoid are in fact connected to the both bohr parameters which are actually used in the calculations .",
    "the different steps of calculations are :    i)the energy of deformation of the liquid drop model is first calculated [ 4 ] .    ii)the schrodinger equation of a microscopic hamiltonian is built and solved to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "in fact we use the fortran program named `` triaxial '' already published in cpc . the microscopic model is explained in details in this paper and also in ref.[3 ] .",
    "\\iii ) the semiclassical energy is deduced from the same hamiltonian as ( ii ) is calculated on the basis of the wigner - kirkwood expansion [ 5 ] .",
    "iv)the shell correction is deduced as the difference between the sum of single - particle ( point ( ii ) ) energies and the same quantity smoothed semiclassically ( point ( iii ) ) .",
    "we use the so - called macroscopic - microscopic method @xcite to evaluate the potential energy of deformation of the nucleus .",
    "this method is based on the liquid drop model plus shell and pairing corrections deduced from a microscopic model @xcite.the deformation ( or potential ) energy of the nucleus is defined as the difference between the binding energy of the deformed drop and the non - deformed drop ( nucleus ) .",
    "@xmath0 here @xmath1 is a set of parameters defining the deformation .",
    "the case @xmath2 represents the spherical shape ( i.e. , the non - deformed nucleus ) .",
    "we recall that in the liquid drop model , the minimum is always obtained for the spherical deformation .",
    "this involves @xmath3 .",
    "of course , the liquid drop or weizsaker formula model contains several terms , but only two depend on the deformation of the nucleus , namely the surface and the coulomb energies . consequently , the other terms do not survive in the difference given by eq .",

    "it is clear that only two deformation parameters are necessary to specify the shape of the nucleus .",
    "the bohr parameters @xmath22 are more commonly employed in this type of calculation . for moderate deformations ,",
    "the link between the semi axes and the bohr parameters is given in ref .",
    "the elliptic integrals are evaluated with gauss quadrature formulae with 64 points .",
    "according to the strutinsky prescription , the shell correction to the liquid drop model is defined as the difference between the sum of the single - particle energies of the occupied states and the `` smoothed part '' of the same quantity : @xmath23 in fact the strutinsky procedure is done in such a way that the smoothed sum does anymore contains shell effects so that the above difference represents only the contribution due to the shell structure . in the strutinsky s method the smoothed sum is derived through the smoothed density of states @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the level density and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the so called order and smearing parameter of the strutinsky s procedure .",
    "the major defect of this method is that generally the results are usually more or less dependent on these two parameters .",
    "a method to diminish this dependence is to use the plateau condition , however in the case of finite wells this is not systematically guaranteed . in this respect , it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the level density given by the strutinsky method is nothing but an approximation of the semiclassical level density , i.e. a quantum level density from which the shell effects have been washed out .",
    "consequently , even though the strutinsky is simpler in practice , it is more interesting to work straightforwardly with the semiclassical density because the problem of the dependence on the two above parameters is in this way avoided .",
    "thus , it is simply recommended to perform the smoothing procedure with the semiclassical level density .",
    "the previous formula becomes in this case : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the semiclassical level density.even though it is not so obvious to derive a semiclassical density of states from a given quantum hamiltonian , there is for our case a rigorous solution ( in the sense where it the same quantum hamiltonian which is `` treated '' semiclassically ) .",
    "indeed , for exactly the same hamiltonian employed to determine the eigenstates , the semiclassical level density is deduced following the wigner - kirkwood method .",
    "the latter is based on the thomas - fermi approximation plus a few corrections appearing as a power series of @xmath30 in this theory , the particle - number is expressed as a function of the fermi level as follows @xcite:@xmath31   \\right\\ }   \\label{213}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the central field ( including the coulomb potential for the protons ) and the spin - orbit field ( see ref .",

    "finally , with obvious notation , the potential energy of deformation can be summarized as follows : @xmath91    where the shell and pairing corrections are due to separates contributions of neutrons and protons .",
    "two codes have been built for calculating the semiclassical energy .",
    "the first code is based on the general deformed case which consists of three fold integral ( subroutine scdefor ) and the second can only be used for the spherical shape with a one dimensional integral ( subroutine sclspher1 ) . then",
