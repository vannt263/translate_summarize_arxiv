    "two of the fundamental parameters driving the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time is their total gas mass , and gas mass surface density .",
    "the total gas mass of galaxies limits the total amount of stars that can form in a galaxy at any time , while its surface density is directly linked with the rate of star formation via the observed kennicutt - schmidt relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the increase of the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density up to redshifts 3 - 4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is theorized to be caused by the increase in the cosmic gas mass density ( and therefore the average total gas mass of galaxies ) with increasing redshift ( as suggested by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , directly measuring the gas mass density out to these redshifts is a difficult task .",
    "existing large area surveys of the 21 cm hi  fine - structure line that trace the atomic gas have only measured the local universe ( @xmath2 , e.g.  hipass , @xcite , and alfalfa , @xcite ) . in the near future , deeper surveys with the precursors for the square kilometer array ( ska ) such as dingo @xcite on the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) will reach at most @xmath3 @xcite . however , it will not be until ska is available that hi  will be observed in emission at @xmath4 , and even then it is expected to reach at most @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this leaves only hi  absorption line studies , such as damped ly@xmath6 systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the only determination of the evolution of the hi mass function over cosmic time .    for molecular gas ,",
    "surveys of large numbers of galaxies have been limited due to the difficulty of observing the transitions from the co molecule in the ( sub)mm .",
    "the two largest efforts have been the fcrao extragalactic co survey @xcite , which measured the co@xmath7 line in 300 nearby galaxies , and the cold gass survey @xcite which measured fluxes in the co@xmath8 line for a purely mass - selected sample of @xmath9 galaxies at @xmath10 , matched in galex , arecibo , and sdss imaging .",
    "the fcrao sample has recently been extended with co@xmath8 observations of a further 59 nearby galaxies as part of the herschel reference survey @xcite . at higher redshift",
    "the co lines are still observable , but samples are smaller in number . while molecular gas measures were originally limited to very luminous , rare objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more typical galaxies are now being observed out to @xmath11 ( e.g. , egnog ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and farther out to @xmath12 ( e.g. , phibss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a full review of these surveys available in @xcite . with alma now operating , the samples of high - redshift galaxy molecular gas masses will only increase .",
    "however , given its small instantaneous field - of - view , alma is a relatively slow survey instrument , and , while already providing impressive targeted observations , will not be suitable for very wide area blind co surveys at @xmath12 @xcite , though smaller blind searches have already been carried out in smaller regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another potential tracer of the total gas mass is the infrared emission arising from dust .",
    "the amount of dust has long been known to be associated with gas column within the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dust extinction has been used to map gas columns at higher dynamic ranges and spatial resolution than available from gas emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in extragalactic studies the lower physical resolution mixes lines of sight , making internal extinction a poor tracer of the gas column ( e.g.  @xcite , and see also @xcite ) , and relying on the rare occultation of relatively bright background sources is not feasible for large extragalactic studies .",
    "however , the dust continuum emission in the infrared ",
    "submillimeter range is a direct tracer of the total dust opacity and , if a mean grain emissivity is assumed , the dust column .",
    "the idea of using the sub - mm continuum emission to measure the mass of the ism has existed for a while , having been suggested by @xcite , and used by @xcite in nearby galaxies .",
    "as an independent tracer of the gas mass , the dust continuum has also been directly compared with co observations in nearby galaxies to constrain the conversion factor between co and gas mass ( i.e.  the `` x '' factor , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the review by @xcite ) .",
    "direct comparisons of the sub - mm continuum and gas content in galaxies have also been explored in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and this correlation has already been used to estimate the total gas masses in higher redshift galaxies by @xcite and @xcite .    yet",
    "the dust continuum emission is not a simple direct tracer of the gas mass .",
    "the dust emission is dependent upon the temperature of the dust grains , the conversion to dust column depends upon knowledge of the grain emissivity , and finally , the conversion of dust column to gas mass depends upon the dust to gas ratio . modelling",
    "the ir spectral energy distribution typically involves the use of both physically - based models for the dust grains and reasonable assumptions for the heating of the grains to determine the total dust column directly from the ir emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this approach has obtained reasonable results in many nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , systematic uncertainties lie in both the dust models and the assumptions on the heating radiation field ( and the parameters in each ) , as well as the fitting procedure itself , introducing another level of complexity in determining the interstellar gas mass .",
    "the recent work of @xcite demonstrated that using a simple modified - blackbody model for the dust emission and a constant conversion factor from dust to gas are not unreasonable assumptions for the determination of total gas mass .",
    "they found a good correlation of the herschel - based dust masses with total gas masses determined from hi and co data in ten nearby galaxies , with an estimated 25% error on the dust method .",
    "however , systematic uncertainties were found to dominate this method as well , with @xcite demonstrating the sensitivity of the determined dust mass to the fitted dust temperature , and the sensitivity of this dust temperature to both the assumed emissivity ( as demonstrated in detail in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the observed wavelengths fitted .    we can bypass these systematic issues by comparing directly the far - ir to submm continuum emission to the various tracers of the gas phases directly .",
    "we can then determine calibrations linking the monochromatic ir emission and gas tracers by exploring a wide range of objects , which also enable the exploration of dependencies on other physical parameters like gas - phase metallicity .",
    "a direct comparison of the sub - mm emission with gas tracers has already been explored somewhat by @xcite , who used a sample of 20 galaxies within the _ herschel_-atlas survey with existing hi  and new co data .",
    "they found that the sub - millimeter fluxes appear to be strongly associated with the diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases , and that the fir / co luminosity ratio decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "however , even though several ir fluxes were explored , the range in the sub - mm luminosities of the galaxies was small .",
    "the most detailed examination to date has been by @xcite , who used both local luminous ir galaxies and higher redshift submillimeter galaxies with 850@xmath13  fluxes to calibrate the ratio of sub - millimeter luminosity to the ism mass assuming a constant emissivity to mass ratio .",
    "they found that the ism mass and 850@xmath13  luminosity correlated within a factor of two for their galaxy sample , and then used this correlation to determine the ism masses in stacked submillimeter alma observations of high redshift galaxies .",
    "however their analysis was focussed on more luminous sources and may not hold for all galaxies .    to improve upon these surveys we use the most comprehensive nearby galaxy surveys available : the kingfish @xcite , things @xcite , and heracles @xcite surveys for the ir , hi , and co data , respectively .",
    "the galaxies in these surveys cover a wide range in metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rates , and with all these parameters measured in a consistent manner from the associated ancillary datasets .",
    "it thus represents one of the largest homogenous datasets for co and hi  in nearby galaxies , and covers the full ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from 70 to 500@xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the galaxies in the sample are near enough that they can be resolved and radial trends can be examined as well .",
    "this enables us to determine the correlation of sub - mm emission with gas mass over a wide range of galaxy parameters , and explore the limiting conditions where the sub - mm emission can be used . in the following section we introduce the surveys and the galaxy sample , followed by a description of the theory in section [ sec : irgaseq ] , and explore a direct comparison of the integrated ir emission to the total gas masses of galaxies in section [ sec : irgascorr ] .",
    "we explore the issues of internal variations and radial trends in section [ sec : radial ] , and summarize our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our galaxy sample arises from the intersection of three complementary large programs surveying nearby galaxies ; kingfish@xcite , things @xcite , and heracles @xcite . these programs provide us with tracers of both the integrated gas and dust masses of galaxies , and resolved maps down to @xmath14kpc scales extending well beyond the optical radii for the hi and ir data .",
    "the matched datasets result in 36 galaxies , ranging from dwarf galaxies to massive spirals , with the names and galaxy properties listed in table [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "all values were taken from @xcite and references therein except for the metallicity which is from @xcite when available .",
    "the sample is dominated by spiral galaxies and irregulars .",
    "the stellar masses and star formation rates both cover approximately 4 orders of magnitude , and approximately 2 orders of magnitude in specific star formation rates ( ssfr@xmath15 ) .",

    "the final h@xmath0 mass for each galaxy is given in table [ tab : masses ] .",
    "the total gas mass for all galaxies is then taken simply as the sum of the hi and molecular gas mass within our chosen apertures .",
    "given that our galaxies cover over 2 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity , an assumption of a constant co luminosity to molecular gas mass conversion factor may lead to biases , especially as different conversion factors have already been determined for several of the galaxies in our sample ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss this point further in the text , but this assumption must be considered when using any of our determined relationships .",
    "the use of the ir emission to trace the total amount of gas is premised on the simple assumption that gas and dust are always associated . assuming that the dust has a single temperature , @xmath356 , the ir luminosity of a galaxy at a frequency , @xmath357 , is linked to the total gas mass of a galaxy m@xmath358 via the equation , @xmath359 where @xmath360 is the dust to gas mass ratio , @xmath361 is the planck blackbody function , and @xmath362 is the dust emissivity at the frequency @xmath357 .",
    "a broad range of ir colors is seen within and between galaxies indicating variation of the mean dust temperature ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , driven by the variation of radiation field strengths experienced by dust in galaxies . however , we can limit the impact of these temperature distributions on the above equation in two ways ; firstly , for most of the kingfish galaxies , it is possible to reproduce their ir sed by having the bulk of the dust heated by a single diffuse radiation field , with only a small fraction being heated by radiation fields stronger than this ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus assuming a single temperature within galaxies for the longer wavelengths is a reasonable assumption .",
    "secondly , by concentrating on longer wavelengths that are well past the peak of the ir sed ( at @xmath363@xmath13 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we move closer to the rayleigh - jeans tail of the black body radiation which is only linearly sensitive to temperature .",
    "* particularly their figure 7 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* particularly their figure 12 ) have both shown that the assumption of a single temperature is reasonable , finding the temperatures of single modified blackbody fits to the integrated 100 - 500@xmath13  ir seds of galaxies in the herschel reference survey and herschel virgo cluster survey , respectively , lying within a factor of 2 ( @xmath364k and @xmath365k , respectively , with early type galaxies having higher temperatures ) .",
    "such a small range of temperatures result in only a factor of @xmath142 uncertainty in the dust mass estimates and hence a factor of 2 in the gas mass determined from the ir in the linear regime .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio and dust emissivity at a given wavelength are somewhat degenerate , with the determination of one relying on an estimate of the other . while estimates exist for these quantities in the local group , it is uncertain how they will vary across different galaxies .",
    "the emissivity is dependent on the composition of dust @xcite , and there have been suggestions that the emissivity will vary in molecular environments . the emissivity has also been suggested to vary with metallicity , such as seen in the lmc by @xcite , however @xcite found no strong trends when comparing more massive galaxies with dwarf galaxies . however , if it is assumed that emissivity at longer wavelengths does not change between galaxies , a clear trend of a decreasing dust - to - gas ratio with the metallicity of the galaxy is seen across the local group @xcite and nearby galaxies @xcite , and even if the emissivity is left free , a lower dust - to - gas ratio is seen in low metallicity dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the dust to gas ratio must be accounted for in any empirical calibration , as we discuss below .",
    "although equation [ eqn : dustlum ] indicates the direct link of gas mass and dust emission via the association of dust and gas , ir emission will also be indirectly associated with gas mass , or more precisely gas mass surface density via the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( ks relation , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an increase in the gas mass surface density has been empirically demonstrated to correlate on average with an increase in the star formation rate surface density on kpc scales ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given this increase in the sfr surface density , the interstellar radiation field that heats the dust",
    "is also expected to be higher , leading in turn to higher average dust temperatures and correspondingly higher ir continuum emission .",
    "this secondary correlation may actually limit the dispersive effect that dust temperature has on the gas mass  ir emission connection , and may even lead to a tighter correlation where the ir luminosity is more responsive to gas mass ( i.e.  where an increase in gas mass leads to both an increase in dust mass and increase in dust temperature due to the increased sfr , and thus a greater increase in ir luminosity ) .",
    "however , unlike the correlation of dust mass and gas mass , the ks relation will act non - linearly on the ir emission . the shortest dust wavelengths that measure the hot dust and peak of the ir emission will see the greatest impact of the increase in dust temperature , and thus also be more sensitive to any variation in the ks relation .      as a first comparison , we determine the simple correlations between the ir luminosities and total gas mass in galaxies . in table [ tab : pearson ] , we show the pearson correlation coefficient ( & spearman rank coefficient ) for all _ herschel _ bands against the total gas mass .",
    "a strong correlation is observed with all bands , with the strongest correlation existing between the longest wavelength ( i.e.  spire 500@xmath13 ) and the total gas mass .",

    "based on the high pearson correlation coefficients , we performed robust linear fits to each _ herschel _ band luminosity versus the total gas mass , of the form , @xmath368band , where band is the log of the luminosity in the given band ( in log@xmath369 ) .",

    "the fits to these galaxies show both a smaller dispersion and steeper slopes than the full sample .",
    "the spire 500 fit is the tightest , with only a 30% dispersion , similar to that found by @xcite in their comparison of gas masses with dust masses determined from fits to the ir sed in 10 nearby galaxies .    given that the full extent of a galaxy in the ir may not always be available , we have also repeated the fits using smaller apertures that are truncated at an optical radius , @xmath374 , using the values for the major and minor axes presented in table [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "these apertures are typically 30% smaller than the ir - encompassing apertures from @xcite that we use . however , as the ir light is generally concentrated to the optical disk , these smaller apertures contain a significant fraction ( @xmath375% ) of the ir light for most galaxies . only a few galaxies with clearly extended ir emission , mostly the smaller galaxies such as ngc3077 ,",
    "have significantly reduced ir fluxes due to the smaller aperture .",
    "similarly , most of the molecular gas is totally contained within an optical radius for all galaxies .",
    "yet the atomic gas can extend well beyond an optical radius , and is observed at greater than @xmath376 in some galaxies .",
    "truncating at @xmath374 reduces the total gas mass because of this extended emission ( this is discussed further in  [ sec : radial ] ) .",
    "we have performed these fits only for the three spire bands , as these show the strongest correlations in table [ tab : pearson ] , and are the most sensitive to extended emission ( and thus show the greatest change with reduced apertures ) .",
    "all fits to the reduced apertures , both to the full and non - dwarf galaxy sub - sample , find slightly flatter slopes than the original apertures , leading also to a larger intercept .",
    "this trend is driven by the dwarf galaxies , which have relatively larger hi gas disks , such that the smaller aperture preferentially reduces the gas mass relative to the ir , flattening the overall slope . thus biasing",

    "secondly , the lower mass galaxies tend to lie above the relation , leading to a much greater scatter , and limit the determination of the gas mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : l500mgas_l500 ] , we remove the mass weighting intrinsic to a luminosity - luminosity plot by plotting the ratio m@xmath381 against @xmath382 , which also emphasizes the scatter of the low - mass galaxies .",

    "the offset observed at low stellar masses in figure [ fig : l500mgas_l500 ] is clearly associated with a decline in the gas phase metallicity .",
    "given this , the most likely cause for this offset is the variation of the dust - to - gas ratio with metallicity .",
    "naively , we would expect the dust - to - gas ratio ( dgr ) to at least linearly decrease with metallicity due to the lack of metals from which to form , with recent works suggesting that a linear dgr to metallicity relation is a reasonable assumption ( * ? ? ?",

    "this effect will act to increase the offset we observe in figure [ fig : l500mgas_l500 ] , but will contribute less than a factor of two ( 0.3 dex ) to any relation .        while the correction for metallicity clearly works for the m@xmath394 relation at long wavelengths , at shorter wavelengths",

    "this lower dust shielding will lead to a lower molecular gas fraction due to increased h@xmath0 dissociation , and a relatively higher dissociation of the co molecule , and thus an increased @xmath378 factor . as we assume a constant @xmath378 factor , an increasing @xmath378 with metallicity ( due to the presence of  co  dark  molecular gas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will also cause the decrease in the molecular gas fraction that we observe ( if a variable @xmath378 is assumed , it is uncertain how much the molecular gas fraction will change with metallicity , see e.g. * ? ? ? * specifically their figure 3 ) .",
    "once the correlation of these ratios with stellar mass is accounted for , no association with other galaxy parameters such as sfr or ssfr is seen ( note however that these parameters correlate with stellar mass in our galaxy sample , as seen in sdss galaxies , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is surprising , given that the 160/500 ratio traces dust temperature , and that molecular gas is associated with star formation .",
    "however , it may be that smaller scale effects not seen in the integrated quantities , such as the spatial distribution of gas , dust and stars , is affecting the correlation to an extent that 2nd order effects are not seen .    in general , we find the best power - law fit to be : @xmath401 = -2.86 + 1.22 \\log ( \\nu{\\rm l}_{\\nu}(160\\mu m)/{\\rm l}_{\\odot})\\ ] ] with a dispersion of @xmath402 around this relation .",
    "however once a galaxy is molecular rich , it is uncertain how well the 160@xmath13  luminosity will trace m@xmath403 . as can be seen in figure [ fig : fmol_irratio ] , at high molecular fractions a broad range of 160@xmath13/500@xmath13  colors are possible .",
    "thus for the most massive objects , the 500@xmath13  luminosity is a better tracer of the molecular gas simply because m@xmath404 .",
    "similarly , given the uncertain effects of dust heating on this relation , extrapolating this to higher redshifts may be problematic .",
    "the sample of galaxies we explore here are typical local galaxies , and cover a range of luminosities and stellar masses ( as seen in table [ tab : galaxies ] ) , however these galaxies may not be representative of more luminous ir galaxies typically seen in sub - mm surveys .",
    "@xcite explore a slightly higher mass range than our sample , though with a significant overlap . for our full sample we find much flatter slopes than @xcite found for the ir versus hi , co(2 - 1 ) and co(3 - 2 ) luminosities .",
    "however for our more massive `` normal '' galaxy sample that overlaps the range observed in @xcite , our slopes appear very similar to those determined by ( * ? ? ? * specifically their figure 4 ) , at least for hi and co(2 - 1 ) , the lines we use for our total gas mass .",
    "however , while they do see trends with stellar mass and metallicity ( such as the decrease in l@xmath405/m@xmath406 with mass and metallicity ) , their dynamic range is not large enough to determine the relations we see here .",
    "@xcite explored the correlation of sub - mm luminosity with ism mass in a sample of sub - mm galaxies at @xmath407 , in addition to a local sample that overlaps our sample with 850@xmath13  detections , and a planck observation of our galaxy . assuming that all the gas was molecular and a similar conversion factor ( @xmath408 )",
    ", @xcite find a ratio of l@xmath409/m@xmath410 ergs@xmath20hz@xmath20m@xmath411 for the sub - mm galaxies , and similar values for the local galaxies ( for which the hi mass was also included ) .",
    "rearranging equation [ eqn : mgasl500 ] , we find a ratio at 500@xmath13  of @xmath412 ergs@xmath20hz@xmath20m@xmath411 for our normal galaxy sample , which , assuming a dust emissivity with a power - law of 1.8 , corresponds to @xmath413 ergs@xmath20hz@xmath20m@xmath411 , in good agreement with the sub - mm galaxy sample of @xcite .",
    "however , applying a single sub - mm emission to gas mass conversion factor , @xmath414 , to all galaxies removes any dependence on other galaxy properties .",
    "we find that for normal galaxies in the local universe , an assumption of a linear relation between sub - mm luminosity and gas mass is reasonable .",
    "given the range of ir luminosities explored in our work and in @xcite , it suggests that , while dust temperatures will affect the sub - mm luminosity to gas mass relationship , the variation in temperature is small enough that it has only a small impact in the rayleigh - jeans regime and thus the relationship .",
    "conversely , there appears to be a significant metallicity evolution over cosmic time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore to apply the observed l@xmath415m@xmath358 relation to all galaxies at higher redshifts , it is crucial that this evolution of the metallicity be accounted for .",
    "this can be done through a direct correction for an inferred metallicity , either directly measured or determined from a mass - metallicity relation , or through allowing the relation ( or @xmath6 ) to evolve with redshift using the metallicity evolution as a basis for the evolving dgr .",
    "an evolving dgr was allowed for in the work of @xcite , who calculated the total gas mass from ir observations in a sample of `` normal '' high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath416 ) . instead of using a direct correlation of sub - mm luminosity and gas mass",
    ", they first calculated the dust mass using model fits to their observed ir seds ( such as the * ? ? ?",
    "* model ) , and then converted to the total gas content using an empirical relationship between the dgr and metallicity determined locally @xcite . while this two - step approach may introduce systematic errors , @xcite find their determined gas masses consistent with the co luminosities ( assuming milky way conversion factors that also vary with metallicity , and assuming the gas is mostly molecular ) .",
    "an example of the application of using ir fluxes to determine the evolution of gas mass is the work of @xcite , who stacked the ir fluxes of galaxies with similar stellar masses , star formation rates and redshifts , to create representative ir seds .",
    "they then fit these seds using dust models , including simple modified blackbodies , to determine the dust masses of these objects , which they converted to a gas mass allowing for a variable dust - to - gas ratio dependent upon stellar mass and sfr . using these",
    "they find a strong correlation in the gas fractions of galaxies with their stellar mass and sfrs , and find strong evolution in both the gas fraction and star formation efficiency ( sfr / m@xmath358 ) with redshift .",
    "in the previous section , we only considered the galaxies as integrated objects , with a single gas mass and luminosity .",
    "however , the kingfish sample provides much more detail than this , and the sub - arcsecond capabilities of alma will mean , even at high - redshift , the continuum emission from galaxies can potentially be resolved ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus to explore the gas ",
    "l@xmath395 relation further , we break the galaxies into elliptical annuli using the position angles and axis ratios of the galaxies given in table [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "the annuli are chosen to be in steps of 2kpc along the major axis        in figure [ fig : annulisgasi500 ] we plot the ratio of the gas mass surface density and spire500 surface brightness for all annuli in our galaxy sample that satisfy the criteria that the annuli was larger than the resolution of the spire500@xmath13  beam ( 36 ) .",
    "the colors of the data indicate the position of the annuli in terms of the optical radius @xmath374 of each galaxy , as given in table [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates that within galaxies the radial profiles follow the same pattern as seen for the integrated luminosities ( i.e.  as in figure [ fig : l500mgas_l500 ] ) , albeit with a larger scatter .",
    "some of this scatter arises from faint background sources at large radii which have not been masked . as with the luminous galaxies",
    ", we see that for high surface brightness regions @xmath417/i@xmath395 is linear , but when we move to lower i@xmath395 we find an increasing trend of @xmath417/i@xmath395 .",
    "this trend is affected by both the intrinsic metallicities of the galaxies as well as the radial trends within galaxies , with a higher @xmath417/i@xmath395 ratio observed at larger radii .",
    "this is emphasized by the horizontal lines which indicate the median @xmath417/i@xmath395 ratio for annuli between @xmath418 ( blue ) , @xmath419 ( purple ) , and @xmath420 ( red ) .",
    "this radial @xmath417/i@xmath395 gradient is likely associated with the radial metallicity gradient within each galaxy , and when the observations are corrected for the metallicity gradient determined by @xcite for some of our sample , this gradient is reduced .",
    "however the gradient is not totally removed , and has a large scatter introduced by the uncertainties in the metallicity gradient ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on these uncertainties ) .    yet using the longer wavelength continuum emission is still a robust tracer of the total gas mass of galaxies , and the gas surface density for most of a galaxy .",
    "the robustness of the sub - mm continuum can be seen in figure [ fig : ngc628radial ] , where we compare the radial variation of the spire500 mean surface brightness , @xmath421 , against the mean gas mass surface density , @xmath422 , in ngc628 .",
    "using the radial determinations of the hi and h@xmath0 gas mass surface densities from @xcite , who stacked the heracles co observations to detect the low column density molecular gas at large radii , we can determine both the radial variation of the total gas mass and the molecular gas fraction in our sample .",
    "using the same 15  elliptical annuli as @xcite , we have determined the radial variation of the spire500 surface brightness ( note that 15  under samples the 36  spire 500 beam by a factor of 3 ) . for illustration purposes , we have scaled @xmath421 by a factor of 25 to be on the same scale as the total gas mass surface density .",
    "it is clear that the ir traces better the total gas mass surface density instead of either the h@xmath0 or hi gas alone in the inner radii .",
    "however , at radii beyond 0.7 @xmath374 there is an increasing deviation of the ir brightness relative to the gas mass density .",
    "a similar trend is seen for some of the other galaxies in our matched sample , such as ngc925 .",
    "however the trend is not seen in all galaxies , with resolution and inclination affecting the observed trends in some objects ( see the attached figures in the appendix ) .",
    "the point where the sub - mm surface brightness and gas mass density separate does not appear to directly correlate with the radius at which the gas becomes mostly atomic , emphasizing that the dust is not just tracing the molecular gas .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by galaxies which are predominantly atomic at all radii .",
    "neither does this separation appear to be related to the surface mass density of ngc628 becoming gas dominated . in figure",
    "[ fig : ngc628radial ] we also indicate the stellar surface density determined from spitzer 3.6@xmath13  data by querejeta et al .",
    "( in prep . ) using the data from the s4 g survey @xcite , arbitrarily scaled by 0.1 to be on the same scale as the gas mass density .",
    "the disk of ngc628 becomes gas dominated beyond the radius at which the ir deviates from @xmath422 ( at @xmath423 ) .",
    "the deviation of the sub - mm emission from the gas is more clearly seen in figure [ fig : ngc628gdr ] , where we plot the ratio of mean gas mass surface density to 500@xmath13  surface brightness as a function of radius for ngc628 . at the inner radii of the galaxy ,",
    "the @xmath424 ratio is flat and then increases in slope beyond @xmath425 . to demonstrate that this change is significant",
    ", we have shaded the data to indicate the fraction of pixels that are significant ( @xmath426 ) , with darker points indicating a larger fraction .",
    "this shading is conservative as we are integrating in annuli , meaning that we are more sensitive to diffuse emission at larger radii .",
    "even given this conservative estimate , it is clear that the measured values of @xmath424 ratio are significant out to @xmath423 .",
    "one possibility for this deviation is that we are seeing a change in the dust to gas ratio at these radii , possibly related to a variation in the radial metallicity gradient at the larger radii .",
    "however , @xcite measure gas - phase abundances out to @xmath427 for several of our galaxies , including ngc628 ( see their figure 7 ) , and no such changes in the abundance gradients are seen .",
    "the expected variation of the gas to dust ratio is indicated by the inverse of the metallicity gradient determined by @xcite , using both the @xcite or @xcite calibrations , as shown by the dashed and solid lines , respectively , on figure [ fig : ngc628gdr ] .",
    "these lines are both normalized to the value of @xmath424 at @xmath428 to emphasize the similarity ( or difference ) of the determined metallicity slopes compared to the observed variation of the @xmath424 ratio .",
    "however , the lines also demonstrate the issues in interpreting the metallicity gradient .",
    "the @xcite calibration follows reasonably well the observed @xmath424 ratio up to @xmath425 , beyond which a deviation from this slope is clearly visible . yet",
    "the @xcite calibration shows a much steeper slope , and , while reasonable below @xmath429 , over - estimates the observed ratio between 0.4 and 0.8 @xmath374 , and no deviation of the @xmath424 ratio relative to this gradient is seen at larger radii . which gradient is more representative of the true gas - phase abundance gradient is uncertain , though @xcite find a metallicity in between the two calibrations shown here at @xmath430 using temperature insensitive metallicity calibration based on fir fine structure lines , suggesting that the gradient may lay between these lines .",
    "the @xmath424 radial variations for the other galaxies in our sample are included in the online - only appendix .",
    "for all galaxies this ratio lies between @xmath431 , with the ratio becoming larger at larger radii .",
    "several galaxies also show a turn up in @xmath424 within @xmath432 , such as ngc6946 .",
    "the increase in the @xmath424 in these galaxy centres is likely associated with the decreased central @xmath378 values observed by @xcite in several of our galaxies , including ngc6946 .",
    "a central decrease in @xmath378 would mean that we overestimate @xmath422 at the center of our galaxies due to our assumption of a constant milky - way value , and hence over - estimate the @xmath424 ratio . for galaxies for which it is available ,",
    "we have also plotted the inverse of the determined metallicity gradients as in figure [ fig : ngc628gdr ] . for several galaxies ( e.g.  ngc3198 )",
    "the metallicity gradient is sufficient to explain the observed radial trend in @xmath424 , with no significant deviations seen .",
    "for some galaxies , i.e.  ngc4254 and ngc4321 , the metallicity gradients are much steeper than the observed @xmath424 ratio . given the observed gradients in gas and stellar surface mass densities , it is possible that the metallicity gradients are much flatter than have been determined for these objects . finally for several galaxies the same excess at large radii relative to the metallicity gradient as in ngc628",
    "is seen ( e.g.  ngc925 and ngc6946 ) .        for these galaxies which show a radial deviation in the @xmath424 ratio , like ngc628 and ngc925",
    ", another possibile explanation is that the different conditions in the outskirts of the galaxies lead to different dust properties which result in different emissivities .",
    "such a variation in the emissivity with radius for some of the kingfish galaxies has already been suggested by @xcite using sub - mm data and in m33 by @xcite .",
    "however , at least some part of this deviation at large radii must arise from the decrease in the mean interstellar radiation field available to heat the dust at these radii , as demonstrated by the radial decrease in stellar density relative to gas density in figure [ fig : ngc628radial ] .",
    "a weaker interstellar radiation field will lead to lower average dust temperatures and thus correspondingly weaker ir emission .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : ngc628radial_s250 ] , where we plot the same quantities as in figure [ fig : ngc628radial ] for ngc628 , but now with the shorter wavelength spire250@xmath13  band ( note the different scaling factor ) . while it is clear in this figure that a change in the ratio of gas mass to ir luminosity occurs at a similar radius , the ratio decreases much more rapidly .",
    "this implies a change in the ir slope , and thus either a decrease in dust temperature or a flattening of the dust power - law emissivity .",
    "a decreasing dust temperature would lead to a lower ir luminosity even without a variation of the dust to gas ratio .        in any case",
    ", it is clear from figure [ fig : ngc628radial ] and the other galaxies in the appendix that for the outskirts of many galaxies ( beyond @xmath433 ) , the ir emission no longer traces the total gas mass in the same manner . for the galaxies in our sample ,",
    "the total gas mass is dominated by the atomic gas at these radii . for many of our galaxies a significant fraction of hi is found outside the optical radius ( a median of 40% for our sample ) , and for several objects emission can be found even outside 2@xmath374 , with an obvious ( and unrepresentative ) example being ngc3077 with its extended tidal streams @xcite . by defining our apertures purely on the extent of the optical and ir emission , it is obvious that such extended gas disks will not be accounted for in the above relations , with the relations missing a large fraction of the total gas mass in some galaxies , like the hi rich dwarfs like ddo154 .",
    "however it is still an open question how much relevance this extended hi gas has on the galaxy as a whole , with all of the molecular gas and most of the star formation inside our chosen `` total '' galaxy apertures and it being uncertain whether this gas external to the galaxy will participate at all in future star formation events within the galaxy .",
    "the evolution of the gas mass density over cosmic time plays a direct role in the evolution of galaxies through its link to the star formation rate . yet",
    "measuring the gas mass directly of a large number of galaxies at high redshifts through line observations is technically difficult , and time consuming . as dust and gas",
    "are intimately associated , the dust infrared continuum may provide a more feasible way to determine the total gas mass of galaxies at high redshift . to demonstrate the use of the ir continuum as a gas tracer we have compared the total gas mass and ir luminosity of a well - studied sample of 36 nearby galaxies ( average distance  10mpc ) observed with the kingfish , things , and heracles surveys .",
    "these galaxies sample the peak of the mass function , with stellar masses from @xmath434 to @xmath435 , and , unlike the local merger - induced ulirgs , these galaxies have disk - like morphologies that are likely more representative of the main - sequence galaxies at high redshift observed in current and future deep sub - mm surveys .    we find a strong correlation between the total gas mass and ir luminosity in all herschel bands , with the strongest and tightest correlation found for the longest wavelength ( spire 500@xmath13 ) .",
    "the gas to luminosity ratio , @xmath436 , is found to increase with decreasing sub - mm luminosity , which can be ascribed to the declining metallicity associated with the lower galaxy masses of the low luminosity galaxies .",
    "this declining metallicity will lead to a lower dust to gas ratio , and therefore higher gas to dust luminosity ratio .",
    "we provide fits to the total gas mass versus ir luminosity relations for all herschel bands , which can be interpolated between to obtain an empirical relation to be used at any ir wavelength for determining the total gas mass ( whose coefficients are given in table [ tab : linearfitgas ] ) . to minimize the effects of metallicity",
    ", we also fit only galaxies with stellar masses greater than @xmath437 in our sample , which also results in a significantly reduced dispersion . for the spire 500 band",
    "we find that a linear relation is a reasonable approximation , and find that log@xmath438 $ ] , with a dispersion of only 0.118 dex .",
    "the molecular gas mass surface density has been demonstrated to be more tightly associated with the sfr than the atomic gas , thus we also provide calibrations for the molecular gas .",
    "we find similarly strong correlations , with the strongest correlation found for the pacs100 and pacs160 bands that lie at the peak of the ir emission , and are strongly correlated with the total ir luminosity .",
    "this correlation between l@xmath439 and m@xmath403 appears to be driven mostly by the correlation of both the average dust temperature ( as measured by pacs160/spire500 ) and molecular gas fraction ( l@xmath405/m@xmath358 ) with galaxy mass and metallicity , with dwarf galaxies showing both warmer dust and lower molecular gas fractions . given this correlation",
    ", we suggest that the l@xmath439m@xmath403 relation not be applied to higher redshifts .    using the resolved nature of the ir and gas surveys we employed in this survey , we also explored the correlations using elliptical annuli , and find the same correlations as the integrated comparisons , albeit with larger scatter .",
    "for most galaxies we find that the @xmath424 ratio increases with radius , as expected from the determined radial metallicity gradients .",
    "however , for some galaxies the @xmath424 relation is observed to deviate from the metallicity gradient at larger radii , becoming much larger .",
    "a drop in the mean dust temperature plays at least some role in this observed excess , given the decrease in stellar mass surface densities relative to gas surface densities , and supported by the observed steeper @xmath422 to @xmath440 relation relative to the @xmath441 radial relation .",
    "this deviation in the @xmath424 ratio in the outskirts in galaxies , and the extended hi disks not visible in the ir observed in a fraction of our galaxies , suggest that the mass of extended gas in galaxies can not be straightforwardly determined from the ir emission .",
    "however , even with these radial trends , the total gas mass of galaxies within their optical radius can be well determined within a factor of 2 by observations of the sub - mm dust emission , and typically to within 30% for typical ( log(m@xmath442 ) galaxies observed in high redshift samples ."
