    "the interference between two initially spatially - separated bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is a fundamental physical problem @xcite .",
    "the potential application of atom interferometry makes the theoretical and experimental researches on the interference mechanism become quite attractive . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical and experimental researches in the last ten years show that the physical mechanism of the interference phenomena between two initially independent bose condensates is a quite nontrivial problem .",
    "in fact , there exist considerable controversies about the physical mechanism of the interference phenomena for two initially independent bose condensates . presently , a popular interpretation about the interference patterns observed in @xcite for two initially independent condensates is the so - called measurement - induced interference theory @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed a new interpretation of interaction - induced interference theory @xcite , which agrees well with the mit s experimental results @xcite .",
    "recently , l. s. cederbaum _ et al _ @xcite supported the viewpoint that interatomic interaction plays an essential role in the observed interference phenomena .",
    "most recently , the theoretical work by d. masiello and w. p. reinhardt @xcite also showed the emergence of interference fringes in the presence of interatomic interaction .",
    "considering the fact that the interference mechanism between two initially independent bose condensates is a fundamental and subtle question , and the fact that two completely different theories ( i.e. measurement - induced interference theory and interaction - induced theory ) coexist , an important and urgent problem is to propose an experimental suggestion to test two different theories . in this paper",
    ", we give an experimental scheme to test two theories in future experiment based on the calculations of the density - density correlation .",
    "different from our previous works about the interaction - induced interference theory xiong1,xiong2,xiong - njp , xiong - coh and other works supporting this theory @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , the present paper gives the first calculations about the density - density correlation in the frame of interaction - induced interference theory .",
    "in mit s experiment @xcite , the density distribution ( first - order coherence ) was measured after the overlapping between two initially independent bose condensates . in the last few years , intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental studies shimizu , coherence - bec , hbt - cold , esslinger , jin , phase - fluc , elonged , bloch , phillips , bloch - fermi , aspect - fermion",
    "have shown that high - order correlation is very powerful in revealing the many - body quantum characteristics of ultracold atomic system .",
    "for example , the second - order correlation function was studied experimentally in esslinger to reveal whether atom lasers exhibit a truly laserlike behavior .",
    "we believe it is worthwhile to study the high - order correlation for two initially independent bose condensates , and ( up to our knowledge ) the previous theoretical studies about the role of interatomic interaction in the interference mechanism did not address this sort of problem yet xiong1,xiong2,xiong - njp , xiong - coh , band , reinhardt . based on the interaction - induced interference theory",
    ", we calculate the evolution of the density - density correlation after releasing a double - well potential trapping two independent condensates .",
    "we find that the interference fringes in the density - density correlation exhibit a special behavior of emergence and disappearance with the development of time . besides this interesting behavior",
    ", we also notice that there is an essential difference in the density - density correlation between interaction - induced interference theory and measurement - induced interference theory , and thus we suggest the experimental studies of the density - density correlation to test further the interference mechanism of two initially independent bose condensates .    because the interference mechanism is a quite subtle problem ,",
    "we think it would be quite useful to give a brief introduction to the problem , experimental facts and different theories .",
    "about ten years ago , the mit group gave strong evidence about the spatial coherence for bose condensates through the observation of clear interference patterns for two separated condensates @xcite .",
    "in mit s experiment , two separated condensates were prepared in a double - well system after evaporative cooling . after releasing the double - well trapping potential , two condensates expand and overlap with sufficiently long expanding time .",
    "after their overlapping , the mit group observed clear interference patterns for two completely different situations .",
    "( i ) when the chemical potential of the system is larger than the height of the center barrier of the double - well potential , the two condensates prepared after the evaporative cooling can be regarded to be coherently separated .",
    "in this situation , every atom is described by an identical wave function which is a coherent superposition of two wave packets in different wells .",
    "it is not surprising that clear interference patterns can be observed .",
    "in fact , the mit group did observe clear interference patterns in this situation .",
    "( ii ) if the chemical potential of the system is much smaller than the height of the center barrier so that the tunneling between two wells can be omitted , after the evaporative cooling for the cold atomic cloud in the double - well trap , two condensates prepared are spatially - separated and independent . here",
    "independent  means that any atom either exists in the left well , or exists in the right well .",
    "it is understandable that no atom s quantum state is a coherent superposition of the wave functions in two separated wells , because during the evaporative cooling precess , the losses of the atoms and interatomic collisions lead to strong decoherence between two wells , and the negligible tunneling can not restore the coherence between two wells even at zero temperature . in this situation ,",
    "the initial quantum state of the whole system at zero temperature is widely described by a fock state @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the number of particles in the left and right wells .",
    "the most exciting phenomenon in mit s experiment is the observation of clear interference patterns for the later situation ( two initially independent condensates ) . for two initially independent condensates , before the releasing of the double - well potential , there is no coherence between two condensates .",
    "exaggeratedly speaking , this is similar to the situation that there is no coherence or correlation between two condensates separately prepared in two different experimental apparatuses . for each condensate , there are no interference patterns during the free expansion .",
    "the interference patterns emerge after the overlapping between two condensates .",
    "thus , the experimental observation of the interference patterns means that a coherence between two initially independent condensates must be established by a physical mechanism .",
    "the fundamental question is what s the physical mechanism for this coherence - establishment process .    presently , the most popular viewpoint is the so - called measurement - induced interference theory @xcite .",
    "measurement - induced interference theory thinks that before the measurement of the density distribution , there is no interference term in the density expectation value even after the overlapping between two initially independent condensates . in measurement - induced interference interpretation , it is thought that the measurement process and the interference terms in the two - particle correlation @xmath3 would establish the coherence between two overlapping and initially independent condensates .",
    "when the number of particles is much larger than @xmath4 , with more and more particles being detected , the measurement induces the transformation from the fock state to a phase state : @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation operators for the left and right condensates , and @xmath8 is a random phase factor . after this transformation",
    ", it is argued that there would be interference patterns in the measurement result of the density distribution . in measurement - induced interference interpretation ,",
    "the interference terms in two - particle correlation function play a key role in the formation process of the phase state ( a clear introduction to this process can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , we found that interatomic interaction can establish the coherence between two initially independent condensates after their overlapping xiong1,xiong2,xiong - njp , xiong - coh . _ _  _ _ in our interaction - induced interference theory @xcite , it is argued that when interatomic interaction is considered , with the evolution of the whole quantum state ( the evolution of the quantum state is obtained by solving the many - body schrdinger equation ) , the interference patterns emerge definitely in the density expectation value , after the overlapping between two initially independent condensates .",
    "this means that the relative phase ( note that this relative phase is completely different from the insignificant relative phase between two initially independent condensates before the releasing of the double - well potential ) between two condensates after the establishment of the coherence is definite , and can be known in principle when the initial condition is known . in the measurement - induced interference theory , however , the relative phase @xmath8 is random in every single - shot experiment .",
    "thus , observing whether there is random relative phase ( i.e. random shift of the interference patterns ) in different experiments can give us direct test between measurement - induced interference theory and interaction - induced interference theory .",
    "however , more careful analyses show that this sort of experiment may be quite challenging . even for completely identical initial condition for the cold atomic cloud in the double - well trap , after the evaporative cooling , there are unavoidable particle - number fluctuations for the condensates in two wells ( i.e. for every experiment , the particle number in each well is different ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "if the interaction - induced interference theory is correct , the particle - number fluctuations will lead to a random relative phase approximated as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the difference of the chemical potential for two condensates ) . if @xmath11 , the experimental observation of the random shift of interference patterns could not give definite evidence to distinguish the measurement - induced interference theory and interaction - induced interference theory .",
    "for the parameters in mit s experiment , simple estimation shows that for the expansion time of @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath14 is the relative difference of the particle number in two wells . in mit",
    "s experiment , rough estimation shows that @xmath15 is larger than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in this situation , even random shift of the interference patterns was observed in mit s experiment , the interaction - induced interference theory can not be excluded .",
    "other technical noises would further challenge the test of two theories based on the measurement of the random relative phase in the density distribution .",
    "m. a. kasevich @xcite gave a very interesting discussion about the technical noise and random phase shift by pointing out that ` in the experiments of @xcite , the phase of the observed interference pattern did fluctuate , though it was not possible to unambiguously identify the mechanism of the fluctuations , because technical noise sources were also present in the measurements . ' .",
    "the above analyses show that further experimental studies are needed to reveal the interference mechanism for two initially independent condensates . in measurement - induced interference theory , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there would be clear interference fringes after the overlapping of two initially independent condensates . in our interaction - induced interference theory , even for the situation of @xmath17 and @xmath19 , there would be no observable interference fringes for sufficiently small interaction effect .",
    "in the extreme noninteracting situation , the interaction - induced interference theory gives a prediction that there is always no interference fringes in the density distribution for the initial fork state @xmath20 . in an experiment , by adjusting the particle number , separation between two wells and even interatomic interaction through feshbach resonance , one may test two different theories from the measurement of the density distribution .",
    "considering the fact that the interference mechanism is a very subtle problem , besides the test based on first - order spatial coherence , we believe high - order coherence can provide further important and at least complementary information about the interference mechanism .",
    "this is a little similar to the discrimination between a thermal light ( a series of independent photons ) and a laser beam based on the high - order correlation .",
    "another merit of the density - density correlation lies in that for the experimental conditions and parameters in the original work of ref .",
    "andrew , we can give important test about the interaction - induced interference theory and measurement - induced interference theory based on the experimental studies of the density - density correlation .",
    "we consider the following normalized density - density correlation function@xmath21this sort of density - density correlation was studied recently for ultracold bosons @xcite _ _  _ _ and fermions @xcite released from an optical lattice . based on the interaction - induced interference theory , at the beginning of the overlapping and due to the presence of interference term in the density - density correlation @xmath22 , there would be interference structure in @xmath23 . with further time evolution and",
    "when two condensates become fully coherent , the quantum state can be approximated as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath23 would become flat in this situation .",
    "this means that there is a behavior of emergence and disappearance for the interference fringes in @xmath23 based on the interaction - induced interference theory . in the measurement - induced interference theory , however , after the overlapping between two condensates , @xmath23 would always exhibit a flat behavior because the measurement makes the system become a phase state .",
    "these simple analyses show clearly that there is essential difference in @xmath23 between measurement - induced interference theory and interaction - induced interference theory .",
    "a merit in the measurement of the density - density correlation function is that small particle - number fluctuations during the evaporative cooling will not change significantly the structure of the density - density correlation function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the result of density - density correlation function based on the interaction - induced interference theory , while in sec .",
    "iii we give the prediction of density - density correlation function based on measurement - induced interference theory . in the last section , a brief summary and discussion are given .",
    "coherence establishment mechanism due to interparticle interaction is in fact widely known and appears in a large number of physical phenomena .",
    "a famous example is the quantum phase transition from mott insulator state to superfluid state for ultracold atoms in optical lattices bose - hubb , jaksch , qpt - exp , when the strength of the optical lattices is decreased adiabatically below a critical value .",
    "one should note that interatomic interaction plays key role in this quantum phase transition process . without the interatomic interaction , decreasing the strength of the optical lattices can make the wavepacket of the atoms exist  in the whole optical lattices , but all the atoms are in different and orthogonal quantum states .",
    "for the double - well system , the adiabatic varying of the center barrier has been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies show clearly that interparticle interaction and the adiabatic decreasing of the center barrier make the initial fock state @xmath25 become a coherently superposed state @xmath26 where the quantum state of all atoms become a coherent superposition of two wavepackets in different wells .",
    "most recently , we considered the general situation with unequal particle number in two wells , and the interaction - induced coherence process was also found , especially the josephson effect for too initially independent bose condensates was predicted @xcite . in mit",
    "s experiment , the double - well potential for two initially independent condensates was switched off suddenly to observe the interference patterns .",
    "this releasing of the double - well potential can be regarded as a non - adiabatical decreasing of the center barrier .",
    "although non - adiabatic process can be quite different from an adiabatic process , the interaction - induced coherence mechanism for the adiabatic process of the double - well system gives us inspiration that interatomic interaction could play important role in the interference phenomena observed in mit s experiment .    in our interaction - induced interference theory @xcite , the interatomic",
    "interaction plays a role of establishing the spatial coherence between two initially independent condensates .",
    "we assume that initially there are @xmath1 particles in the left condensate and @xmath2 particles in the right condensate .",
    "we assume further that the single - particle wave functions are respectively @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "after releasing the double - well potential trapping two independent condensates , even after their overlapping , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are always orthogonal without interatomic interaction . in the presence of interatomic interaction , however , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are no longer orthogonal after their overlapping .",
    "if we still use two orthogonal basis @xmath27 and @xmath29 , the non - orthogonal property between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is equivalent to the physical picture that there are coherent particle exchanges between the orthogonal basis @xmath27 and @xmath29 in the presence of interatomic interaction .",
    "we have verified rigorously that for large particle number , even a small non - orthogonality between @xmath27 and @xmath28 can lead to high  contrast interference fringes in the density expectation value @xmath30 xiong1,xiong2,xiong - njp .    when the non - orthogonal property between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is considered , it is obvious that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not commutative any more .",
    "simple calculation gives @xmath33=\\zeta ^{\\ast } = \\int \\phi _ { 1}^{\\ast } \\phi _ { 2}dv$ ] .",
    "in this situation , the many - body quantum state is@xmath34 @xmath35 is a normalization constant determined by@xmath36it is well - known that the field operator should be expanded in terms of a complete and orthogonal basis set .",
    "therefore , we construct two orthogonal wave functions @xmath27 and @xmath29 . assuming that @xmath37 , based on the conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 . introducing an annihilation operator @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",

    "<S> , we find that the interference fringes in the density - density correlation exhibit a behavior of emergence and disappearance with the development of time . </S>",
    "<S> we find essential difference for the density - density correlation based on interaction - induced interference theory and measurement - induced interference theory , and thus we suggest the density - density correlation to experimentally reveal further the interference mechanism for two initially independent bose condensates .    </S>",
