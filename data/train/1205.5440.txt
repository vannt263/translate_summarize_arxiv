    "after more than a century of intensive research , many - body physics is an increasingly thriving field describing most of the phenomena appearing in nature . its goal is to understand the macroscopic properties of large collections of interacting particles ( typically of the order of @xmath0 ) from their microscopic laws of motion . in typical situations",
    "the dynamics of the ensemble is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath1 whose complexity and vast dimension impedes a direct solution .",
    "however , many complex quantum phenomena can be understood solely from the low - energy spectrum of @xmath1 , such as quantum phase transitions , topological insulation and superconductivity , just to name a few .",
    "therefore a common strategy of many - body - physics is the derivation of a perturbative effective hamiltonian @xmath2 , which approximates the low - energy spectrum of @xmath1 and reduces the complexity of the problem by integrating out the high - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the most prominent examples of the success of this approach is the connection between the kondo model and the low excitation spectrum of the anderson model , which has been established in 1966 @xcite .",
    "it was achieved by a formalized version of ( quasi-)degenerate perturbation theory @xcite , which is nowadays known as _ schrieffer - wolff _ ( sw ) _ transformation _ and which paved the way for a deep understanding of these two distinguished models of condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "the many analytical and numerical applications of this perturbative tool in contemporary physics are far too numerous to list here exhaustively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum system to its environment , a paradigm shift could be observed in quantum physics in recent years , as the description of open systems moved into the focus of the field .",
    "many seminal works in the context of , e.g. , metrology in the presence of noise @xcite , dissipative quantum phase transitions @xcite , as well as dissipation assisted quantum state preparation and quantum computation @xcite , appeared over the past years .",
    "the situation for open systems in many respects parallels the considerations above . for markovian environments ,",
    "the system dynamics are described by a non - hermitian liouville operator @xmath3 . in many cases",
    "one is interested only in the low excitation spectrum of @xmath3 , which describes the steady state behavior of the system and comprises in many situations the relevant dynamics , since higher excitations are typically negligibly occupied during the system s evolution .",
    "one prominent example constitutes the emerging field of dissipative phase transitions , which is intimately related to the low excitation spectrum of the liouvillian @xcite .",
    "also the widespread method of adiabatic elimination of fast evolving degrees of freedom  routinely employed in the field of quantum optics",
    " corresponds to the derivation of a perturbative effective liouvillian describing to low excitation dynamics of a system .",
    "more formalized perturbative tools that accomplish the goal of deriving effective dynamics for open systems to second order have been developed for specific scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , the available tools for open quantum systems are far less advanced than their hamiltonian analogs .    in this paper , we present a formalized perturbation theory in the language of a generalized sw transformation , which adapts this formalism for markovian open systems .",
    "we consider the most general case of a liouvillian operator that features an internal hierarchy , i.e. , it can be divided into a unperturbed part and a perturbation @xmath4 . a non - unitary similarity transformation on @xmath3 dresses the zero eigenstates of @xmath5 ( i.e. , the unperturbed steady states ) with higher excitation eigenstates according to the perturbation @xmath6 and by construction decouples exactly the corresponding _ slow _ and _ fast space _",
    ", respectively .",
    "the projection of the transformed liouvillian onto this slow space ( spanned by the dressed steady states of @xmath5 ) reproduces the exact low excitation spectrum and describes the system evolution in the vicinity of the steady state . in analogy to the unitary sw transformation this effective liouvillian @xmath7 can naturally be expanded in orders of the perturbation parameter @xmath8 , yielding a systematic perturbative series of the low excitation spectrum and in particular the steady state properties .",
    "we stress the point that in contrast to previous perturbative approaches , our formalism works with minimal assumptions on the specific nature of @xmath5 and produces perturbative results to arbitrary order .",
    "the procedure formalizes the usual perturbative approach and corresponds to an adiabatic elimination of the fast evolving degrees of freedom .",
    "the phenomenon that the effective low - energy hamiltonian derived from integrating out high - energy degrees of freedom , often features a higher complexity than the original one , led in closed systems to the concept of perturbation gadgets @xcite . along these lines , the idea of _ dissipative gadgets _ ,",
    "i.e. , the engineering of dissipation for quantum state preparation and protection has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "the presented sw formalism provides a natural tool for designing dissipation according to the desired steady state properties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we derive the generalized sw transformation for open systems .",
    "we show , that in the new basis a subspace of slow dynamics decouples exactly from all fast degrees of freedom and we derive an effective liouvillian within this subspace in a perturbative series [ ] .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : xpls ] we employ the formalism in two generic examples , presenting two alternative strategies to evaluate the formal expressions for the effective liouvillians and discussing general properties of the different orders of the perturbation .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results and provide a brief outlook .",
    "we consider an open system whose evolution is governed by a markovian master equation .",
    "the corresponding liouville operator can be partitioned in a zeroth order term @xmath5 and a perturbation @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath8 denotes the dimensionless perturbation parameter .",
    "@xmath5 is a linear operator on the vector space of @xmath11 matrices ( @xmath12 is the dimension of the system hilbert space ) .",
    "we introduce the set of left and right eigenvectors for the non - hermitian operator @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath13 which are chosen to be biorthonormal @xmath14 and generically satisfy the completeness relation @xmath15 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath16 are in general complex .    since @xmath5 is the generator of a universal dynamical map ( i.e. , a contractive semigroup ) , its eigenvalues fulfill @xmath17 .",
    "the generated maps are trace preserving , which guarantees that the kernel of @xmath5 is at least one dimensional .",
    "we partition its spectrum in two subsets @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( throughout the paper we will refer to eigenvalues from the two sets and the corresponding eigenvectors with greek and arabic indices , respectively ) .",
    "the spectral gap of the unperturbed liouville operator is denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "the in general non - orthogonal projectors @xmath21 define the subspaces corresponding to the spectral sets @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these subspaces are in the following referred to as the slow ( defined by @xmath24 ) and fast ( defined by @xmath25 ) space , respectively , according to their evolution under the action of @xmath5 .",
    "we use this partition of the left and right eigenbases to introduce a block structure for arbitrary superoperators @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the space of linear operators acting on the system s hilbert space @xmath28 ( an example for such a superoperator constitutes the liouville operator @xmath3 itself ) , @xmath29 further we introduce block diagonal and block off - diagonal operators @xmath30 by construction the unperturbed liouville operator is block diagonal in this basis @xmath31 , while the perturbation in general contains both block diagonal and off - diagonal terms @xmath32 . in analogy to the hamiltonian schrieffer - wolff transformation our goal is to find a similarity transformation @xmath33 such that the two subspaces decouple @xmath34    being similar [ ] , the transformed ( @xmath35 ) and original ( @xmath3 ) liouvillian share the same spectrum . in the perturbative limit @xmath36 @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the superoperator @xmath37 ( referred to as _ effective liouville operator _ ) reproduce the exact low excitation spectrum of @xmath3 .",
    "the master equation @xmath38 thus describes accurately the steady state properties and low excitation dynamics , i.e. , the system evolution in vicinity of the steady state .",
    "in addition , the schrieffer - wolff transformation offers by construction a natural expansion of the effective liouvillian in the perturbation parameter @xmath8 .    in the following",
    "we generalize the generic procedure to construct the transformation matrix @xmath39 for hermitian matrices ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) to the non - hermitian case .",
    "it can be shown that does not uniquely define the decoupling operator @xmath39 .",
    "we will here only consider the so called canonical choice @xmath40 , where the generator s is imposed to be block off - diagonal @xmath41 .",
    "other choices of @xmath42 are possible , which then lead to different perturbation theory formalisms , as outlined in @xcite for the hermitian case . depending on the specific problem , alternative gauge choices for",
    "@xmath42 may prove to be advantageous .",
    "the discussion of the properties of the various formalisms represents an interesting subject for future studies .    to simplify the formalism we introduce a compact notation where the commutation with an operator @xmath43 is expressed via the superoperator @xmath44 defined via : @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath46 denotes an arbitrary operator .",
    "this notation allows for an compact representation of the similarity transformation @xmath47 + \\frac{1}{2 ! }",
    "\\left[[\\mathcal l , s],s\\right ] + \\hdots\\\\\\nonumber & = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i ! } \\hat s^ i\\mathcal l = e^{\\hat s } \\mathcal l.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we partition the latter superoperator into its odd and even powers @xmath48 the convenience of the canonical choice now becomes evident . while the odd operator @xmath49 changes block diagonal to off diagonal operators and vice versa , the even powers @xmath50 respects that structure .",
    "therefore we can rewrite condition @xmath51 where in the last step we used @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "can be solved formally using resolvent operator techniques . since by construction",
    "the slow space defined by the set @xmath22 contains only unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath54 , it is @xmath55 and the resolvent operator takes the simple form @xmath56 by construction the projection of the zero order liouvillian into the fast space @xmath57 has full rank and its inverse is well defined .",
    "for simplicity we denote @xmath58 .",
    "for block off - diagonal operators @xmath59 the resolvent operator fulfills @xmath60 as can be checked straightforwardly . applying this superoperator to gives the conditional equation for the generating matrix @xmath61 @xmath62 having derived a formal implicit expression for the transformation matrix @xmath61 , which renders the liouville operator block diagonal @xmath63",
    ", we now derive a compact expression for the diagonal blocks @xmath64 in terms of @xmath61 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "as before , the block off - diagonal structure of @xmath61 allows us to write @xmath64 as combination of even and odd powers of the superoperator @xmath65 @xmath66 where in the second line we used . using the basic trigonometric relation @xmath67 we find @xmath68 as discussed in @xcite all the above hyperbolic transformations are well defined for infinitesimal transformation matrices @xmath61 , which is guaranteed for appropriate perturbation parameters @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the perturbative correction to @xmath5 as @xmath69 since by construction @xmath70 the effective liouville operator in the slow space is given as @xmath71 and all dynamics in that space are at least of first order in the perturbation .    expanding @xmath61 in orders of the perturbation parameter @xmath8 in a taylor series @xmath72 and using one can deduce a recursive equation for the @xmath73 . with these results we can directly construct the perturbative correction @xmath74 via order by order .",

    "@xmath79    where we employed the notation introduced in and @xmath80 denotes the anti commutator .",
    "note that @xmath81 reproduces the well know second order result of adiabatic elimination in dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "in this section we will exemplarily employ the formalism developed above in two generic situations and present two alternative strategies to evaluate the expressions for the effective liouvillians of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : gas ] we consider the general setting of an ancilla system , which undergoes fast ( in general dissipative ) dynamics and is weakly coupled to a system .",
    "we adiabatically eliminate the ancilla to second order , employing the sw formalism .",
    "the coefficients of the effective liouvillian are expressed in terms of ancilla time correlation functions , which can readily be evaluated using the quantum regression theorem .",
    "if one finds a set of operator expectation values with equations of motions that close under the action of @xmath5 ( in finite dimensional hilbert spaces this is always the case ) , the effective master equation can be readily evaluated , even if the ancilla system is high dimensional and its dynamics complicated .",
    "we show that the effective liouville operator to second order is always of lindblad form @xcite , implying a markovian evolution of the system .",
    "if the zeroth order liuovillian @xmath5 is simple , it is advisable to explicitly calculate the matrices @xmath9 and @xmath82 . given these matrices , arbitrary orders of the perturbation can readily be evaluated according to . in section  [ sec : ms : to ] we consider an example recently studied in the context of superradiance in solid state systems @xcite , which features simple zeroth order dynamics .",
    "we calculate explicitly the effective liouvillian up to third order and show that the typically neglected third order has significant impact on the evolution of the system .      in the following we consider an example of how to apply the formalism in a generic ancilla setting .",
    "a system is weakly coupled to an ( unspecified ) ancilla system , which undergoes fast ( dissipative and/or coherent ) dynamics .",
    "the hilbert space of the total system is the product of the ancilla s and system s spaces @xmath83 .",

    "let us for simplicity assume that @xmath5 features a unique steady state @xmath87 such that the projector on the space of zeroth order steady states can be written in the simple form @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "in the last step we introduced the reduced density matrix @xmath89 . the weak coupling to the system is realized by the most general hamiltonian interaction @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are arbitrary hermitian ancilla and system operators , respectively . for notational convenience",
    "we will suppress the @xmath93-symbol in the following : @xmath94 .",
    "the full master equation thus reads @xmath95    note that the example we consider here corresponds to the often encountered situation of a bipartite system with separation of timescales .",
    "the ancilla evolution occurs on a timescale much faster than the system evolution .",

    "furthermore , the density matrix of the system remains positive throughout the evolution , although the third order liouvillian it is not obviously of lindblad form . in the following we show that in the limit @xmath172 one can recover lindblad form by adding terms of higher order in the perturbation . in this case , all non - lindblad effects are of an order that is deliberately neglected .    for @xmath172 , reduces to the simple expression ( in standard representation ) @xmath173 + i \\frac{g}{4\\gamma}\\gamma_{\\textrm{eff } } [ i^+ i^z i^- , \\mu ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term of @xmath170 can be combined with the first term of @xmath171 @xmath174 \\right ) \\\\\\nonumber = & \\gamma_{\\textrm{eff } } \\left ( e^{-i \\frac{g}{2\\gamma}i^z } i^- \\mu i^+e^{i \\frac{g}{2\\gamma}i^z } + o\\left[(g/\\gamma)^2\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used relation .",

    "the advantages of the presented method are twofold .",
    "first , minimal assumptions on the specific type of the zero order dynamics @xmath5 have to be made .",
    "the subspace to be eliminated can be high dimensional and undergoing involved dynamics .",
    "second , our approach in principle is an exact decoupling scheme , and can be applied to all orders in the perturbation .",
    "this property is of particular relevance for instance in numerical studies of low excitation spectra of the liouville operator , e.g. , in the context of dissipative phase transitions @xcite , and for error estimation in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the sw formalism provides a natural framework for the engineering of dissipative gadgets , e.g. , in the context of state preparation and protection @xcite .",
    "we employed the sw formalism exemplarily to two model systems and presented different schemes to evaluate the expressions for the effective liouvillians . in a generic ancilla",
    "setting , we proved that the effective evolution of the weakly coupled system is up to second order markovian , irrespective of the specific realization of the ancilla . in a second example we demonstrated",
    "that - in contrast to the standard schemes of adiabatic elimination - higher order corrections can readily be derived within the sw framework . in this model , the third order correction plays a significant role in the perturbative dynamics .",
    "further , we point out that the freedom of a gauge choice in the derivation of the transformation matrix could lead to a set of alternative perturbative approaches , which , in analogy to the standard sw transformation and depending on the specific problem , could prove to be advantageous under certain conditions .",
    "potentially , this gauge freedom could also be used to ensure lindblad form of the higher order effective liouvillians .",
    "lastly , we mention the numerous theoretical results @xcite ( e.g. , linked cluster theorem , additivity of effective hamiltonian ) , which have been derived in the context of coherent sw transformations as well as different variations of the sw method ( e.g. , continuous sw @xcite ) , which may have open system analogs",

    "we have to show positivity of the respective coefficient matrix @xmath178        we exploit that property in symmetrizing in the time arguments .",
