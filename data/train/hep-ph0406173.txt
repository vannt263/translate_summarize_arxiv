    "of recent years the proton spin puzzle has attracted much attention . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quark spin is found to be responsible for only a small amount of the proton spin .",
    "the gluon spin contribution is also estimated from the global analysis of the parton distribution function@xcite , but has yet large uncertainties .",
    "the experiment of polarized proton collision at rhic in progress is expected to give some clue to the gluon spin content .",
    "such being the situation , it is desirable to study the possibility that the orbital angular momentum may contribute to some extent to the proton spin and the orbital motion may induce intrinsic deformations of the baryons .",
    "non - spherical components in baryons have been discussed in the context of the color magnetic interaction@xcite , the electromagnetic transition@xcite and the generalized parton distribution@xcite .",
    "deformed baryon states are investigated also in soliton models@xcite .",
    "since the topological soliton is quantized to the fixed ( iso-)spin states by rotation , the intrinsic deformations directly correlate with orbital motions in this description . considering that the shape of the charge density is probed via the photon",
    ", we study the skyrme model coupled with the electromagnetic field .",
    "note that there are two kinds of terms which are brought about by the coupling of the gauge field ; non - anomalous terms through covariant derivatives and anomalous terms through the gauged wess - zumino ( wz ) term .",
    "the gauge fields are minimally incorporated through the covariant derivatives . using variation of an action obtained by the minimal replacement , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite computed configurations of the gauge field as well as the soliton and estimated the magnetic moment .",
    "they found that the dipole magnetic field is generated around the soliton and the magnetic moment has reasonable value .",
    "however the topological current is not taken into account in their variational equations .",
    "the topological baryon current is naturally incorporated in the maxwell equation if one considers the gauged wz term .",
    "the gauge fields affect the system not only through the covariant derivatives but also through the gauged wz term , which is not obtained by the minimal replacement of derivatives in the wz term .",
    "the gauged wz term is designed to account for the non - conservation of the axial current by the anomaly and to describe correctly anomalous processes like @xmath0 in the pion sector .",
    "this term possibly influences the system also in the soliton sector .",
    "above all , the gauged wz term is indispensable to assure the gauge invariance of conserved currents like the baryon current and the electric current as well .",
    "actually , the gauged wz term provides an anomalous contribution@xcite of the magnetic field to the isospin charge of the soliton .",
    "although the electromagnetic field is usually treated perturbatively owing to the small coupling constant , it is worth estimating the anomalous contribution of the gauge field as the wz term is essential for the anomalous baryon current .",
    "it is possible that the gauged wz term exerts significant influences on the physical quantities of the isospin fixed solitons . in this work ,",
    "we adopt an action including the gauged wz term and construct spin polarized skyrmions with a proper electric charge imposing boundary conditions upon the chiral field and the gauge field .",
    "we calculate the configuration of these fields and study the properties of the spin polarized skyrmions , particularly characteristic spatial structure of the electric charge , current and the magnetic field . through these results ,",
    "we discuss the intrinsic deformations of the charge density as well as the significance of the effects of the electromagnetic fields from the gauged wz term in the soliton model .",
    "we present a model written in terms of the chiral field and the gauge fields . to make it manifest how the gauge fields are incorporated in the system , we consider a chirally gauged model first in a general context and",
    "then restrict ourselves to a model coupled with the electromagnetic field only .",
    "the action of the chiral field consists of the non - linear sigma term , the skyrme term with pion mass term and the wess - zumino term as @xmath1 ^ 2   + \\frac{1}{8}m_\\pi^2f_\\pi^2({\\rm tr}u-2 ) \\right ) + \\vargamma_{\\rm wz } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the wess - zumino term , @xmath2 , is expressed compactly by the use of differential forms as @xmath3 with the abbreviation p.c .  for parity conjugate : @xmath4 .",
    "the covariant derivative for the chiral field is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "this action except the wess - zumino term and the pion mass term has the gauge symmetry and is invariant under the gauge transformation : @xmath6 the wess - zumino term is constructed so as to reproduce the chiral anomaly attended by this transformation and hence can not be obtained by the minimal replacement of differential operators which makes an action gauge - invariant .",
    "the noether current@xcite associated with the vector symmetry , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 , generated by @xmath8 is @xmath9[ud^\\mu u^\\dag , ud^\\nu u^\\dag ]      + ( { \\rm p.c . } ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -   \\frac{in_{\\rm c}}{48\\pi^2 } \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho }     { \\rm tr}\\ iq [ ( udu^\\dag)_{\\nu\\lambda\\rho}^3-      \\{u d_\\nu u^\\dag , f_{{\\rm r}\\lambda \\rho}+ \\frac{1}{2 }       u f_{{\\rm l}\\lambda\\rho}u^\\dag   \\ } - ( { \\rm p.c . } ) ]   , \\label{cur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the field strengths for the gauge fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 respectively .",
    "if we set @xmath14 to get the baryon current , only the last term  the contribution from the wz term  survives and we find the baryon number is equivalent to the winding number .",
    "therefore we can identify a baryon with a topological soliton in this model .",
    "now we restrict ourselves to study of the su@xmath15 chiral field and the u@xmath16 gauge field , @xmath17 .",
    "the electric charge matrix satisfies the gell - mann  nishijima relation : @xmath18 .",
    "a soliton of a unit baryon number is realized in the hedgehog form : @xmath19 with the boundary conditions @xmath20 .",
    "the electric potential is assumed to be spherical @xmath21 for simplicity , and the angular dependence of the vector potential is fixed as @xmath22 to match the ampre law .",
    "here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the polar and azimuthal angle respectively .",
    "all these do not depend on time and such a static configuration is always taken by the gauge transformation ( [ g - tr ] ) .",
    "even a ( time - dependent ) collective rotation of the chiral field can be described by taking @xmath25 as the rotation matrix , if one lets @xmath26 take a constant value in proportion to the angular velocity .",
    "the total lagrangian density including the kinetic term of the electromagnetic field is written in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29    + \\frac{s_f^2}{2\\epsilon^2}\\left[\\left(f^{\\prime 2}+\\frac{s_f^2}{r^2}\\right ) \\right(v^2\\sin^2\\theta -\\frac{(1+h\\sin^2\\theta)^2}{r^2}\\left )   -\\frac{f^{\\prime 2}}{r^2 } \\right ] \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{4}m_\\pi^2f_\\pi^2(1-c_f )    + \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2r^2}\\left[s_f^2 f^{\\prime 2}v + \\frac{1}{2}s_fc_fhv'\\sin^2\\theta -v\\left(f'h\\cos^2\\theta+ \\frac{1}{2}c_fs_f h'\\sin^2\\theta\\right)\\right ] \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2e^2}\\left(v^{\\prime 2}-4\\frac{h^2}{r^4}\\cos^2\\theta -\\frac{h^{\\prime 2}}{r^2}\\sin^2\\theta\\right )   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "after the angular integration and scaling @xmath32 by @xmath33 to be dimensionless , we are led to the variational equations ; @xmath34 the gauss law @xmath35 with the angular averaged charge density , @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and an equation deduced from the ampre law @xmath37 , @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the fine structure constant @xmath39 .",
    "note that the magnetic field @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 in r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) ) is instrumental in producing partly the electric charge @xmath42 as a source of the electric field @xmath43 and that @xmath43 contributes the electric current @xmath44 as a source of @xmath40 .",
    "this complementarity comes from the gauged wz term in the action which provides the anomalous couplings between electromagnetic field and the chiral field like @xmath45 .",
    "the term brings to @xmath46 an anomalous current of the dual field strength as @xmath47 with the non - vanishing pion field @xmath48 in the soliton sector .",
    "in addition to this , here we emphasize that the topological term of the baryon density is correctly incorporated in the charge density due to the gauged wz term , as one can see the first term in r.  h.  s.  of eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) .",
    "we solve the coupled equations ( [ eqf])-([eqh ] ) imposing boundary conditions for the fields , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the charge number of the soliton ( to be set at 1 or 0 ) and @xmath51 is a modified pion mass@xcite caused by ` rotation ' of the soliton .",
    "the angular velocity is turned to an asymptotic constant @xmath52 by a gauge transformation as mentioned previously and thus non - zero @xmath52 corresponds to a ` rotation ' of the soliton . in practical computing",
    ", we impose a boundary condition on @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 without any tuning of @xmath52 and confirm finite values , actually .",
    "however , the rotation matrix does not cover the whole su(2 ) group because the generator @xmath55 of u@xmath56(1 ) gauge group includes only the @xmath57 component of the isospin matrix .",
    "accordingly , @xmath58 can not be excluded from nucleon states without the casimir projection as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our treatment is not equivalent to the collective quantization of rotation fully , but to one - dimensional cranking .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath57 component of isospin ( as the electric charge minus one half of the baryon number ) is assured of a quantized value @xmath59 for the charged and neutral soliton ( @xmath60 ) only by the boundary conditions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , though this does not mean a topological quantization of isospin in contrast to that of the baryon number . since the asymptotic value @xmath52 affects the boundary condition of @xmath63 , the self - consistent approach we took to solve the differential equations corresponds to the variation after projection .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath57-component of the spin takes @xmath64 for the charged and neutral solitons , since the spatial rotation means the inverse iso - rotation for the hedgehog configuration and the photon contribution to the spin is negligible which we confirm numerically .",
    "therefore we regard the soliton as a spin polarized nucleon with possible admixture of the @xmath58 component .",
    "we solve the differential equations with the boundary conditions for proton ( @xmath65 ) and neutron ( @xmath66 ) using the relaxation method .",
    "three sets of parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chosen while @xmath69 is fixed at the physical pion mass .",
    "set i : @xmath70 is determined so that the charge radius of the proton is reproduced with physical pion decay constant .",
    "set ii : @xmath71 and set iii : @xmath72 are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we find that for set i , @xmath73 such that @xmath74 decreases by a few % compared with that of set ii .",
    "while this means @xmath63 for set i is squeezed , @xmath63 for set iii , on the contrary , swells compared to set ii .",
    "although the boundary condition constrains the fields to have the different asymptotic behavior , profiles of @xmath63 with sets ii and iii are almost the same as that obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the configurations of the electromagnetic field are also determined simultaneously , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vh ] .    .",
    "bold lines are for the charged soliton and thin lines are for the neutral one .",
    "the electric potentials ( normalized by @xmath33 ) with the asymptotic constants subtracted are shown by solid lines and @xmath75 s which determine the magnetic field are by dashed lines.,width=292 ]    the electric potentials display correctly the coulombic behavior for large @xmath76 , and the smeared peak near the origin means finite structures of soliton s charge unlike a point particle .",
    "the function @xmath28 gives the magnetic field as @xmath77 and the radial distance of their peak determines the size of the dipole magnetic field . the spatial distribution of the fields discussed in detail later .",
    "physical quantities with these parameter sets are shown in table [ tab ] .",
    ".static properties of the nucleon described by the soliton with several sets of parameters .",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the mean square charge , baryon number and magnetic radii . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for sets i and iii , the mass of solitons deviates from the experimental values , but these receive corrections of meson loop and higher chiral - order terms@xcite .",
    "mass differences between proton and neutron are of proper magnitude for all sets of parameters but show the opposite sign .",
    "this is because the spherical ansats for the electric field is oversimple to give the correct sign , though we take the electric field into account even for the neutron .",
    "in fact , the energy of the electric field contributes about 0.2% to the proton mass which is reasonable for the mass difference , while it almost vanishes for the neutron case .",
    "this setting is also reflected in the charge radius defined as @xmath81 with the charge density , @xmath82 which is obtained with assignment @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ cur ] ) and scaling to the dimensionless variables . for the proton",
    ", the positive charge density is piled up and the charge radius is well reproduced comparatively . for the neutron ,",
    "however , the positive and negative charge densities compete with each other and the charge radius of neutron is overestimated several times as much .",
    "the main contribution to the charge density , ( [ j0 ] ) , comes from the first term of the baryon - number density near the origin and from the last term of the isospin charge for the medium range .",
    "since the latter has a remarkable polar - angle dependence , the spatial distribution of the electric - charge density presents a deformed or a toric structure with a core according to the isospin , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ch ] .",
    "the baryon number density depends also on the polar angle through the gauge field , @xmath84 but it is almost spherical because the small fine structure constant suppresses the magnitude of field @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "the isospin charge is mainly contributed from the non - linear sigma term proportional to @xmath85 as is seen in eq .",
    "( [ j0 ] ) .",
    "this term affects the electric charge with the opposite sign for charged and neutral solitons , especially in the region such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chzen ] , the solid curves of the charged soliton change according to the polar angle and smoothly merge into the dashed lines of the neutral one at the polar region .",
    "although the angular - averaged density of the electric charge agrees with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath23 dependence makes an oblate shape for the charged soliton and a prolate positive - charge surrounded by a toric negative - charge for the neutral soliton .",
    "the deformed charge density is interpreted as a consequence of the centrifugal force accompanying the rotation of soliton .",
    "the radius of the negative - charge torus is about @xmath88 fm with the parameter set ii , which is governed by the distance @xmath73 such that @xmath89 .",
    "since such a deformed structure can not be realized for the nucleon with spin @xmath90 , the density distribution is interpreted to stand for an intrinsic deformation of the nucleon and also to reflect the admixed @xmath58 component .",
    "plane ( left ) and the neutral soliton in the @xmath91 space ( right ) calculated with the parameter set ii .",
    "note that the soliton spin is polarized along the @xmath57 axis .",
    "gray and black dots are positive and negative charges .",

    "our results in unit of the nuclear magneton are comparable to the experimental values including their sign .    the reasonable estimation of the magnetic moment results from the dipole magnetic field generated by the current of soliton",
    "actually , the magnetic field expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eb ] ) has a dipole structure induced by the circular current eq .",
    "( [ ji ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bj ] .",
    "these field configurations are the same for both of the charged and neutral cases , while the spin of the neutral ( charged ) soliton is polarized ( anti-)parallel to the @xmath57 axis .",
    "the radius of the circular current is also controlled by the scale @xmath73 satisfying @xmath89 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is understood also on an analogy with the meissner effect in the super conductor .",
    "the coefficient of the vector potential in the current , @xmath97 , plays a role of a square ` mass ' of the gauge field , because this factor can be read as the coefficient of @xmath98 in the action . in case of the hedgehog configuration ,",
    "the large ` mass ' region forms a torus whose core , as one can see from the factor @xmath99 , is located at the circle around the @xmath57-axis such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the configuration of the magnetic field is determined so as to avoid the large ` meissner mass ' region to save the total energy . as a consequence of this fact , the magnetic field coils around a genus of the torus .",
    "the axial coupling tends to be one half of experiments , which agrees with refs .",
    "the pion - nucleon sigma term evaluated from the symmetry breaking term results in the adequate value as shown in table [ tab ] .    in any case , contributions of the electromagnetic field via the gauged wess - zumino term are controlled by the fine structure constant and hence amount to 1% of the physical quantities , at most .",
    "therefore the complementary dynamics of the electromagnetic field is not conspicuous in the present situation .",
    "however , this anomalous contribution might be influential in high dense matter .",
    "we have studied the effects of the electromagnetic field coupling to the soliton configuration via the gauged wess - zumino term .",
    "we pointed out that the gauged wess - zumino term provides the maxwell equation with anomalous terms in the presence of the soliton .",
    "unless this term is considered , the topological baryon current can not correctly be incorporated in the charge density of variational equations .",
    "furthermore non - vanishing pion fields make the anomalous coupling @xmath102 effective in the soliton sector , and the electric and magnetic fields contribute complementarily to the source current of each other .",
    "such a current from the dual field strength is interesting theoretically , but in reality these effects are suppressed by the small coupling constant .",
    "because the anomalous contribution of the electric field is small , the spatial distribution of the electric current is mainly determined by the non - anomalous term of the isospin current . from this , it is concluded that the electric current has the toric configuration , and accordingly that the magnetic field has a poloidal structure coiling around the circular current according to the ampre law .",
    "this dipole magnetic field is understood as a consequence of the meissner - like effect .",
    "actually , the meissner ` mass ' of the gauge field is estimated from the chiral angle @xmath61 as @xmath103 corresponding to the condensate of the cooper pairs .",
    "contrast to the superconductor , the large mass region does not extend uniformly but forms a finite torus , and hence the magnetic flux quantization can not be achieved in our case .    as discussed above ,",
    "the symmetric axis of the torus of the field configuration is to be interpreted physically as a spin - quantization axis of the soliton .",
    "this leads us to a reasonable consequence that the magnetic moments evaluated from the asymptotic form of the poloidal magnetic fields are ( anti-)aligned with the spin of the charged ( neutral ) soliton .",
    "the theoretical value of the magnetic moment derived from the variational solution is of the same order as the experimental value of the nucleon .",
    "we have found that the electric charge distributions are distinctive for their polar angle dependence .",
    "the equatorial swelling of the isospin charge makes the difference while the spherical core of baryon number density is common to charged and neutral solitons .",
    "our results show that the charged soliton has the oblate shape of the charge density and the neutral soliton has the toric negative charge surrounding the prolate shape of positive charge .",
    "these distributions are consistent with the pion cloud rounding the nucleon or may imply a u - d diquark core accompanied by the other valence quark . in any case , the characteristic distributions of the charge density suggest the intrinsic deformation of baryons and the isospin - dependent quadrupole moment , which might be observed in the @xmath104 transition .    as in the dynamo theory for the planetary magnetic field ,",
    "a poloidal magnetic field may induce a toroidal magnetic field through the rotation of the soliton , and _ vice versa _",
    ", even though the physical scale is quite different .",
    "it is our future work to take account of this effect by extending the variational space of the magnetic field .",
    "the non - radial electric field is also important to estimate the mass of the proton and the neutron and to discuss a correlation between the orbital motion and the intrinsic deformation .",
