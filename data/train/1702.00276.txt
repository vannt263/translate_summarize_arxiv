    "the next generation wireless communication systems aim to achieve giga bit / s throughput to support high speed multimedia data service @xcite .",
    "since there exist ample amount of unutilized frequency spectrum in millimeter wave ( mmwave ) band ( 30 ghz-300 ghz ) , wireless communication over mmwave band is considered as a promising solution to achieve significant leap in spectral efficiency @xcite . however , one major limitation of mmwave communications is significant free space path loss , which causes large attenuation of signal power at the receiver .",
    "furthermore , the overall path loss gets worse when the signal goes through obstacles , rain , foliage , and any blockage to mobile devices .",
    "recently , active research on mmwave communication has been conducted in order to overcome these limitations @xcite . in mmwave band",
    ", many antenna elements can be integrated in a small form factor and hence , we can employ high directional beamforming using a large number of antennas to compensate high path loss .    in order to perform high directional beamforming ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate channels for all transmitter and receiver antenna pair .",
    "while this step requires high computational complexity due to large number of antennas , channel estimation can be performed efficiently by using the angular domain representation of channels @xcite . in angular domain ,",
    "only a few angular bins contain the most of the received energy .",
    "hence , if we identify the dominant angular bins ( which correspond to the angle of arrival ( aoa ) and the angle of departure ( aod ) ) , we can obtain the channel estimate without incurring computational complexity .",
    "basically , both aod and aoa can be estimated using so called  beam training \" procedure .",
    "the base - station sends the training beams at the designated direction and the receiver estimates the aod / aoa based on the received signals .",
    "widely used beam training method ( called  beam cycling method \" ) is to allow the base - station to transmit @xmath0 training beams one by one at the equally spaced directions .",
    "however , to ensure good estimate of aod / aoa , @xmath0 should be large , leading to significant training overhead .",
    "this problem becomes even more serious for the mobility scenario in mmwave communications .",
    "since the location of mobiles keeps changing , the base - station should transmit training beams more frequently to update aod / aoa estimates , causing significant drop in data throughput @xcite .",
    "recently , several adaptive beam training schemes have been proposed to improve the conventional beam training method @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a novel beam training method for mobility scenario in mmwave communications .",
    "our idea is based on the observation that for mobility scenario , the aod of the particular user does not change drastically so that continuous nature of the aod change can be accounted to improve the efficacy of the beam training .",
    "since this approach exploits temporal dynamics of aod , we call such beam training scheme  beam tracking \" .",
    "while the conventional method makes no assumption on the state of aod , we use statistical distribution of the aod given the previously state of aod . using the probabilistic model on aod change , we derive effective beam tracking strategy which employs transmission of two training beams from the base - station .",
    "optimal placement of two training beams in angular domain is sought by minimizing ( the lower bound of ) variance of the estimation error for aod . as a result",
    ", we choose the best beam pair from the beam codebook for the given prior knowledge on aod .",
    "our simulation results show that the proposed beam tracking method offers the channel estimation performance comparable to the conventional beam training methods with significantly reduced training overhead .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows ; in section [ sec_sys_model ] , we introduce the system and channel models for mmwave communications and in section [ sec_proscheme ] , we describe the proposed beam tracking method and the simulation results are provided in section [ sec_sim_result ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the system model for mmwave communications .",
    "first , we describe the angular domain representation of the mmwave channel and then we introduce the procedure for beam training and channel estimation .",

    "exhibiting @xmath3 multi - paths , @xmath26 has dominant value only in the @xmath3 elements and almost zero value for the rest .      for channel estimation ,",
    "the standard mmwave systems employ  beam training method \" where the base - station transmits the known symbols using the @xmath0 training beams and the mobile estimates the channel using the received signals .",
    "each beam training cycle consist of transmission of the @xmath0 training beams .",

    "note that the channel estimation is equivalent to estimation of @xmath51 from the received signal vector @xmath52 in ( [ eq : ffff ] ) .",
    "one widely used beam training strategy is  beam cycling \" which transmits @xmath0 training beams at the uniformly spaced directions .",
    "since this approach does not exploit the knowledge on the location of the mobile , the value of @xmath0 required for the receiver to achieve good channel estimation quality should be large .",
    "while adaptive beam training approaches have been proposed to improve the overhead of beam cycling @xcite , they require the feedback from the mobile during the same beam training cycle . in this section",
    ", we introduce the efficient beam training scheme which exploits the temporal dynamics of aod to reduce the training overhead of the conventional beam training methods .",
    "since the proposed scheme exploits the tracking of the time - varying aod for beam training , we will refer to our scheme as  beam tracking method \" .",
    "[ t ] +    fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_scheme ] depicts the proposed beam training protocol in comparison with conventional beam cycling scheme .",
    "while the conventional beam cycling transmits each beam one at a time towards all directions , the proposed scheme transmits only two beams toward the directions optimized by the proposed beam selection method . in the beginning",
    ", the proposed scheme does not have knowledge of the aod and hence it employs the conventional beam cycling .",
    "once the mobile obtains the estimate of the aod from the received signal , the aod estimate is fed back to the base - station .",
    "then , using the feedback from the mobile , the base - station select the best beam pair from the codebook @xmath30 , which promises the best channel estimation performance at the mobile .",
    "based on the received signals , the mobile performs the channel estimation and feeds back the aod again .",
    "these steps repeat for every beam transmission cycle .",
    "note that the proposed scheme uses the feedback obtained from the previous round of beam training so that the latency penalty due to feedback is small .",
    "this point is contrary to that for the adaptive beam training scheme in @xcite .      in order to design the proposed beam tracking scheme ,",
    "we employ the statistical model capturing the smooth characteristics of channels under mobility . specifically , we model the temporal dynamics of the aod using the markov random process .",
    "note that the distribution of the current value of aod depends only through the previous state of the aod .",
    "for example , the aod at the @xmath4th beam training cycle , @xmath53 is distributed by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the aod at the previous beam training cycle and @xmath56 is the variance of gaussian distribution .",
    "note that various distribution ( such as laplacian ) can be used instead of gaussian .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 indicates the extent of the mobility for the mobile .",
    "the stronger the mobility is , the larger @xmath56 gets .",
    "hence , in practice , we can find one dimensional mapping of the average speed of the mobile to the appropriate value of @xmath56 . as the aod is discretized in our model in ( [ eq : canon ] )",
    ", we can easily transform the distribution in ( [ eq : markov ] ) into that of discrete random variable .      for now , we assume that strong line of sight ( los ) exists , i.e. , @xmath57 . hence , we will omit the path index @xmath7 for the time being . as mentioned above , at the @xmath4th beam transmission cycle ,",
    "the base - station transmits the two beamforming vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 in a row . the beamforming matrix @xmath60 is obtained by choosing the two beam pair from the codebook @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath61 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the selected indices of beamforming vectors in the codebook .",
    "note that the codebook we generate includes the beamforming vectors with different beam - widths and with different steering directions at uniformly quantized angular bin .",
    "once the optimal beamforming vectors are selected , we can modify them accounting for the hardware limitation of mmwave systems @xcite .",
    "@xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the channel gain for los path .",
    "though the selection of the combining vector @xmath67 should be considered for the optimal beamforming design , we exclude the combining matrix from our design parameters for the sake of convenience .",
    "hence , we assume that the receiver obtains the correct estimate of the aoa and hence we can let @xmath68 .",
    "using @xmath69 , we get @xmath70 note that in ( [ eq : sep_measurement2 ] ) , the channel estimation boils down to estimating both the aod @xmath71 and the channel gain @xmath66 based on the model for @xmath72 .",
    "the joint estimation of the aod @xmath71 and the channel gain @xmath66 can be obtained from maximum likelihood ( ml ) criterion .",
    "the log - likelihood function is given by @xmath73 then , the ml estimate is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 note that the optimization in ( [ eq : opt ] ) is performed by searching for the candidate of @xmath71 minimizing the cost metric @xmath76 over uniformly quantized angular grid for representing the aod . in order to reduce the search complexity",
    ", we can restrict the search range within the angle formed by the two training beams @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme3 ] . )",
    "this allows for significant reduction in computational complexity required for estimation of the aod .",
    "alternatively , we can increase the resolution of aod estimation without incurring additional computational complexity .",
    "[ t ]       now , we present the proposed beam selection algorithm which selects the best beamforming vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the codebook @xmath30 that yield the best performance in aod estimation .",
    "note that we use the statistical distribution of the aod @xmath71 in the derivation of optimal beam selection .",
    "since it is not straightforward to derive the analytical expression for the mean square error ( mse ) , @xmath79 $ ] , we use the cramer rao lower bound ( crlb ) averaged over the distribution of @xmath71 as a performance metric .",
    "the fisher information matrix for joint estimation of @xmath71 and @xmath66 is expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82 .",

    "the average crlb is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is drawn from ( [ eq : model ] ) . in case",
    "when the distribution is discretized , we can replace the integration by the summation in ( [ eq : avgcrlb ] ) .",
    "note that we choose the best beamforming vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 which minimizes the average crlb , i.e. , @xmath88 note that the optimization in ( [ eq : cost_metric ] ) requires two dimensional search over all beam indices in the code book .",
    "fortunately , we observe that the directions for the optimized beam pair are symmetric with each other around the previous aod estimate @xmath85 .",
    "this allows us to conduct one dimensional search over the angle made between two beamforming vectors . in practical applications , we conduct the optimization for beam selection in offline and generate the look - up table which maps @xmath89 to the optimal beam indices directly",
    "though our derivation is based on the assumption that the previous aod @xmath85 is known , the assumption is not strict since we use the estimate of the previous aod fed back from the mobile . in order to compensate this mismatch , we refine the aod model introducing the perturbation error @xmath90 in @xmath91 and derive the crlb given the estimate of the previous aod @xmath92 in an iterative fashion .",
    "[ t ] +    so far , we have presented the new beam tracking strategy for single path scenarios .",
    "we can easily extend the proposed scheme for the scenario where there exist @xmath3 multi paths in mmwave channels . if the aods associated with each path are well separated in angular domain , it is possible to apply the proposed tracking scheme derived for single path for each individual path while ignoring the existence of other paths . in this scenario ,",
    "the base - station transmits two training beams for each of @xmath3 path , requiring @xmath93 beam transmissions in total .",
    "since we search for the aod estimate within the restricted range , we can separate each path from each other without negligible performance loss . when the different paths are clustered in angular domain",
    ", we have to find joint estimate of aods based on the received signals generated from @xmath93 beam transmissions .",
    "the optimization for designing @xmath93 beamforming vectors can be performed for each path .",
    "the estimation of @xmath3 values of aod can be performed via compressed sensing techniques such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide the simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed beam tracking method .",
    "we consider the base - station and the mobile equipped with @xmath94 antennas .",
    "we consider uniform linear arrays ( ulas ) antennas and the channel gain @xmath66 is modeled by i.i.d .",

    "the whole search range @xmath97 $ ] for the aod estimation is discretized into 192 angular bins .",
    "the codebook used for the proposed scheme includes the beamforming vectors formed by the steering vectors with 192 uniform directions .",
    "we add additional 192 steering vectors with wider beamwidth obtained by turning off the half of transmit antennas .",

    "[ fig : tracking_performance ] shows how time - varying aod is tracked by the proposed scheme .",
    "we compare our method with the conventional beam cycling method using the 32 training beams and the scheme using the fixed beam pair whose angle is 5 bins away from the previous aod estimate .",
    "we set the standard deviation in the distribution of aod to @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the signal to noise power ratio ( snr ) is set to 10 db .",
    "note that higher standard deviation indicates higher mobility for mmwave communications .",
    "it is shown that though the proposed scheme uses only two training beam , the proposed scheme produces the aod estimate close to the true value and achieves the performance comparable to the conventional beam cycling which requires 16 times longer training period .",
    "the fixed beam scheme does not exhibit good performance .",
    "this shows that the optimal beam selection can bring significant performance gain over the heuristics .    in fig.[fig :",

    "we compare our scheme with the conventional beam cycling methods using different resolutions as well as the fixed beam scheme .",
    "note that the mse performance is floored for all schemes as the snr gets higher since we use the discretized angular grid for aod estimation .",
    "we observe that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain in aod estimation over the conventional methods over all range of snr of interest .",
