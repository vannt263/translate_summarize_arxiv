    "it is generally believed that molecular clouds are turbulent ( see the reviews of @xcite ) .",
    "observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this turbulence appears to be highly supersonic with rms mach numbers of anything up to 20 or more .",
    "it is also thought that the alfvnic mach number is not significantly less than one , and may be much greater ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the amplitude of this turbulence makes it likely to be an important ingredient in both the dynamics of molecular clouds and the process of star formation @xcite and hence developing an understanding of this phenomenon is of considerable interest .",
    "many authors have addressed the issue of mhd turbulence in the context of molecular clouds using both the ideal mhd approximation @xcite and , more recently , various flavours of non - ideal mhd @xcite .",
    "three dimensional mhd turbulence involves the transfer of energy from an energy injection scale to ever smaller scales until the dissipation length scale of the system is reached .",
    "given that in molecular clouds the lengthscales at which multifluid effects become important are much larger than the viscous lengthscale , it is inevitable that these effects will have an impact on the energy cascade .",
    "when ambipolar diffusion is included in mhd turbulence simulations it has been found that it causes greater temporal variability in the turbulence statistics @xcite .",
    "although clearly of lesser significance @xcite , the hall effect is capable of inducing topological changes in the magnetic field which are quite distinct to any influence caused by ambipolar diffusion . in particular , it introduces a handedness into the flow which is of particular interest when considering the conversion of kinetic energy into magnetic energy .",
    "researchers working on reconnection and the solar wind have studied the hall effect in the context of turbulence and found that , although the overall decay rate appears not to be affected , the usual coincidence of the magnetic and velocity fields seen in ideal mhd does not occur at small scales @xcite .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) performed simulations of decaying , non - ideal mhd , molecular cloud turbulence incorporating parallel resistivity , the hall effect and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "they found that the hall effect has surprisingly little impact on the behaviour of the turbulence : it does not affect the energy decay at all and has very limited impact on the power spectra of any of the dynamical variables , with the exception of the magnetic field at very short length - scales .",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) extended the results of paper i to properly multifluid mhd turbulent decay .",
    "a system of three fluids , 1 neutral and two charged species , was simulated and , intriguingly , it appears that for the chosen system a full multifluid simulation is unnecessary and simple non - ideal mhd with temporally and spatially constant resistivities can give quite reliable results .    in this paper",
    "we use the hydra code @xcite to investigate _ driven _ , isothermal , multifluid mhd turbulence in a system consisting of 4 fluids ( 1 neutral and 3 charged ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine the influence of multifluid effects on the behaviour of driven turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "an added benefit of our properly multifluid approach is that we can self - consistently deduce the behaviour of the charged species and , in principle , make links with observations such as those of @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we outline the equations and numerical method ; in section [ sec : initial - conditions ] we specify our parameters , initial conditions and how we drive the turbulence in our simulations ; section [ sec : resolution - study ] contains the results of a resolution study demonstrating that the results we present are reasonably well converged ; section [ sec : results ] contains the results and analysis of our simulations and finally we draw conclusions from our work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we note here that we omit a discussion of the differences in line widths between the charged and the neutral species .",
    "the results associated with these differences require detailed discussion in their own right and are the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "molecular clouds are , to a great extent , weakly ionised systems .",
    "this allows us to make several simplifying assumptions , as follows :    * the bulk flow velocity _ is _ the neutral velocity * the majority of collisions experienced by each charged species occur with neutrals * the charged species inertia is unimportant * the charged species pressure gradient is unimportant    making these assumptions allows us to derive a relationship between the electric field and the current density .",
    "this generalised ohm s law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to avoid having to calculate the electric field explicitly from the charge distribution .",
    "once we have our generalised ohm s law , the system of equations for our weakly ionised flow is as follows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the species ( with @xmath2 denoting the neutral species ) , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass density of species @xmath1 , the velocity of species @xmath1 , the isothermal sound speed , the magnetic field , the identity matrix , the current density and the electric field in the neutral rest frame , respectively . the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the charge - to - mass ratios and the collision coefficient with the neutrals for species @xmath1 .",
    "these equations describe conservation of mass for all species , the neutral momentum equation , the induction equation , force balance for the charged species , the absence of magnetic monopoles , faraday s law and charge neutrality . in the work presented here we set @xmath12 .",
    "the electric field in the frame of the fluid , @xmath9 , is calculated from the generalised ohm s law for weakly ionised fluids ( e.g.   @xcite ) and is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 using the definitions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the parallel , hall and ambipolar resistivities respectively and are given by @xmath24 with the conductivities given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hall parameter for species  @xmath1 and is given by @xmath27      equations ( [ mass ] )  ( [ charge_neutrality ] ) are a nonlinear system of pdes and , in general , must be tackled using simulations . with modern techniques",
    "the system is relatively straightforward , with the exception of dealing with the right - hand side of equation ( [ b_eqn ] ) .",
    "the method used by hydra to integrate these equations has been elucidated previously in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so we only give a brief recapitulation of this here and refer the reader to these papers for a more in - depth discussion .",
    "the system is solved using an operator - split approach with three operators :    * the equations governing the neutrals are solved using a standard second order , shock capturing godunov scheme .",
    "the induction equation is also solved as part of this operator , but without incorporation of the non - ideal effects .",
    "the divergence of the magnetic field is controlled using the method of @xcite . *",
    "the magnetic diffusion terms are evaluated and applied using the super - time - stepping method ( for the ambipolar and parallel resistivity terms ) and the hall diffusion scheme ( for the hall term ) . *",
    "the velocities of the charged species are determined from equation ( [ charged_mom ] ) and the distribution of their densities are updated using a second order upwind scheme .",
    "the whole system of operators is stepped forward in time using strang operator splitting in order to ensure second order accuracy in time .    since molecular cloud material has very low kinematic viscosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , flows , these systems have a high prandtl number and thus we can consider them to be effectively inviscid . as with all higher - order schemes , our simulations incorporate artificial viscosity which smears discontinuities over around 3  5 grid zones .",
    "this artificial viscosity length scale is much less than that over which the multifluid effects act ( see , for example , figure [ fig : v - spec - res ] ) and thus our multifluid effects dominate at all scales above around 3  5 grid zones . formally , the prandtl number of the highest resolution simulations in this work is around 15 .",
    "the method is explicit and scales extremely well on massively parallel systems , displaying strong scaling from 8192 up to 294,912 cores with 73% efficiency on the jugene bluegene / p system in jlich , germany .",
    "we run our turbulence simulation in a cube of side 0.2pc with periodic boundary conditions on all faces .",
    "the density is initially uniform and has the value of @xmath28@xmath29 , assuming that the average neutral particle has a mass of 2.33@xmath30 ( where @xmath30 is the mass of the proton ) .",
    "the magnetic field is also initially uniform of strength 20@xmath31 g respectively .",
    "the ( isothermal ) sound - speed is chosen to be @xmath32cms@xmath33 or , equivalently , the temperature is 10k .",
    "the four fluids in the system are initially at rest . these parameters were chosen to be representative of molecular clouds on scales of 0.2pc and are based on the data in table 1 of @xcite . the grid used is uniform and made up of @xmath34 grid points with @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasise here that this work is directed at understanding the nature of multifluid mhd turbulence .",
    "a physical system with the properties just described will have a mass just below the jeans mass and so may well be subject to dynamically important self - gravity .",
    "however , it seems reasonable that the optimal way of approaching understanding the behaviour of molecular clouds is to first attempt to understand the turbulence , and then to introduce self - gravity .",
    "introducing all the physical effects at once runs the risk of producing results which , while possibly valid , are very difficult to interpret .",
    "the properties of the charged species are based on the data in @xcite .",
    "we make the approximation that the dust density is 1% that of the neutrals .",
    "the metal ions are assumed to be singly ionised and to have an average mass of 24@xmath30 and a mass density of @xmath36g@xmath29 . the electron density is then chosen to ensure local charge neutrality .",
    "this set - up results in an ionisation fraction of approximately @xmath37 and the system is therefore clearly weakly ionised .    in order to drive turbulence",
    "we add velocity increments to the neutral velocity at each time - step .",
    "the incremental velocity field , @xmath38 , is defined in a manner similar to @xcite .",
    "each component of @xmath38 is generated from a set of waves with wave numbers , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the amplitudes of these waves are drawn from a gaussian random distribution with mean 1.0 and deviation 0.33 while the phases of the waves are drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath41 .",
    "the waves are chosen such that the forcing is solenoidal .",
    "it is known that the precise nature of the forcing will influence the turbulence statistics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we focus on gaining some insight into the influences of multifluid effects on turbulence and leave a study of multifluid mhd turbulence under differing driving to a later date .    finally , to ensure a constant energy injection rate and zero net momentum injection , a quadratic equation must be solved to normalise @xmath38 . the resulting normalised incremental velocity field",
    "is then added on to the neutral velocity field .",
    "the rate of injection of energy is the same for all simulations in this work and is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the initial ( uniform ) density , @xmath44 is the length of side of the computational domain and @xmath5 is the ( isothermal ) sound speed . in our simulations",
    "this energy injection rate yields steady state turbulence with an rms mach number of around 4.5 and an alfvnic mach number of between 3 and 3.5 .",

    "we have presented the results of 4-fluid , mhd turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "the parameters chosen were matched to the observations of molecular clouds reported in @xcite .",
    "we performed a resolution study to ensure that the results presented , in terms of both the power spectra and the rms mach number , were not strongly influenced by resolution effects .",
    "we found that the rms mass - weighted mach number was not significantly decreased with the inclusion of multifluid effects , in spite of multifluid effects providing an effective pathway for removal of magnetic energy .",
    "the overall energy dissipation , then , appears not to be significantly affected by multifluid effects .",
    "this phenomenon is a result of the fact that the majority of the energy in a driven , turbulent system with the properties of a molecular cloud resides in kinetic energy and so an enhanced removal of magnetic energy does not significantly effect the global energetics of the system .",
    "we found that both the velocity power spectra of the neutrals and the magnetic field power spectra were strongly influenced by multifluid effects at all length - scales up to the driving scale ( 0.05pc ) . in multifluid mhd",
    ", the velocity power spectrum of the neutrals is found to have considerably less structure at all length - scales than those of the charged species .",
    "the electron and ion fluids behave almost identically to each other , while the dust displays some slight differences with the other charged species .",
    "this latter point arises largely from the requirement of local charge neutrality and the fact that the electrons and ions are the dominant charge carriers in the system .",
    "we also find , at very short length - scales , some signs of the hall effect in the power spectra of the charged species .",
    "thus we find , in common with the results presented in papers i and ii that multifluid effects are important up to quite large length - scales .",
    "this result appears to be in conflict with the observations of @xcite and we deal with this apparent contradiction in a forthcoming paper",
    ".    the differences in the power spectra of the bulk densities in the multifluid and ideal mhd systems are not as dramatic as those in the other variables , although there is somewhat less power in the distribution of the neutral density in the multifluid simulation than the bulk density in the ideal mhd one .",
    "interestingly , there is _ less _ power in the spectrum of the charged species density than the neutral species in the multifluid system .",
    "this is the opposite of what is found for the velocity power spectra .    for all species , and for all cases ,",
    "the density pdfs are found to be very close to log - normal .",
    "the neutral species in the multifluid simulation has a slightly less platykurtic ( flattened ) distribution than that in the ideal mhd case .",
    "the charged densities in the multifluid simulation have , in turn , less platykurtic distributions than the neutrals in that simulation with the dust actually having a leptokurtic distribution .",
    "each of these results is explained in terms of the ambipolar diffusion experienced by the multifluid system , and the fact that the charged species are more directly influenced by the magnetic field than the neutrals .",
    "finally , we find that multifluid effects do not significantly influence the centroid velocity increment structure functions .",
    "the computations for this work were carried out as part of the deisa - deci 6 project `` d - sturb '' .",
    "we also acknowledge the results presented in this paper were partly achieved using the prace research infrastructure resource jugene based in germany at the jlich supercomputing centre ."
