    "the renormalized stress - energy tensor ( rset ) @xmath0 is an object of fundamental importance in quantum field theory in curved space - time , since it governs , via the semi - classical einstein equations @xmath1 the back - reaction of the quantum field on the space - time geometry . computing the rset on a particular space - time background is a complicated process @xcite , and , for a quantum scalar field @xmath2 , it is informative to study first the renormalized vacuum polarization @xmath3 , which is considerably easier to compute and has many of the same features as the full rset .",
    "for example , although @xmath3 is a scalar object and hence can not distinguish between future and past event horizons , nonetheless , if it diverges at a horizon for a particular quantum state , then it is likely that the rset also diverges there .",
    "the vacuum polarization @xmath3 has been extensively studied by many authors for various black hole backgrounds , beginning with computations by candelas @xcite of @xmath3 for a massless , conformally coupled , scalar field on the event horizon ( and at infinity ) for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this was subsequently extended to the whole of the schwarzschild geometry in refs .",
    "@xcite ( exterior to the event horizon ) and @xcite ( interior to the event horizon ) .",
    "the corresponding calculation for massive scalar fields was done by anderson @xcite .",
    "other examples of calculations of @xmath3 on more general black hole space - times can be found in @xcite . as well as exact , numerical calculations ,",
    "a number of approximation schemes have been developed for various types of space - times , both for @xmath3 @xcite and the rset @xcite .",
    "of the three standard vacua for quantum fields on black hole space - times ( hartle - hawking @xcite , unruh @xcite or boulware @xcite ) , the hartle - hawking state has received the most attention in the literature .",
    "this is because the hartle - hawking vacuum possesses the most symmetries ( for example , time reversal symmetry ) and so is more straightforward to calculate .",
    "expectation values of observables in this state are also expected to be regular on the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "once the renormalized expectation values in a particular state ( say the hartle - hawking state ) have been computed , it is much easier to compute renormalized expectation values in another state because the difference between expectation values in two states does not require renormalization . a general method for computing @xmath3 on any static , spherically symmetric , black hole space - time for a state at either a fixed non - zero temperature or zero temperature was developed by anderson @xcite , and subsequently extended to calculations of the rset @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for an application of this type of approach to the space - time outside a star ) .",
    "this is the method we shall adopt in this paper .",
    "this approach works for computations of the hartle - hawking ( non - zero temperature ) and boulware ( zero temperature ) states , but not for the unruh vacuum .",
    "most of the work on @xmath3 and the rset to date has focussed on asymptotically flat black holes , such as schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm . however , there are many interesting features of quantum field theory on asymptotically de sitter black holes @xcite , when we have both a black hole event horizon and a cosmological horizon .",
    "the kay - wald theorem @xcite states that there is no thermal state on schwarzschild - de sitter black holes which preserves all the symmetries of the metric ( including time - reversal symmetry ) and which is regular on both the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "therefore there is no equivalent of the hartle - hawking state for this geometry .",
    "this may be understood heuristically as follows .",
    "a thermal state is expected to be regular at a horizon if the temperature of the state matches the temperature of the horizon . however , for schwarzschild - de sitter black holes , the temperatures of the event and cosmological horizons are not equal and therefore any thermal state can not match both temperatures . if we consider the more general case of reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes , then it is possible for the event and cosmological horizons to have the same temperature @xcite ( these are known as ` lukewarm ' black holes @xcite ) . therefore a natural question is whether the thermal state , constructed on these black holes at the natural temperature , is regular on both the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "a simple calculation for two - dimensional black holes @xcite shows that this is the case , but for four - dimensional black holes there is an unknown function in the rset which can only be found by direct calculation .",
    "we will return to the computation of this function in the near future @xcite , but in the present paper we will focus on the simpler computation of @xmath3 for this state .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ash ]",
    "we review the method of @xcite to calculate @xmath3 using point - splitting . as we are considering a thermal quantum state ,",
    "the euclidean green s function will be used .",
    "using temporal point - splitting , even with the points split the green s function contains apparent divergences .",
    "we present in section [ sec : finite ] a new approach to regularizing these divergences , based on dimensional reduction . once the point - split green s function is manifestly finite , the renormalization procedure is then relatively straightforward , following @xcite .",
    "the renormalized expectation value @xmath3 is computed numerically for lukewarm black holes in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "our numerical results indicate that @xmath3 is indeed regular on both the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "this is proved analytically in section [ sec : regular ] , in which we use an approximation for the field modes near the horizons , developed in ref .",

    "we should comment that the first terms in the expansions of @xmath273 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 do have @xmath12 and not @xmath224 in the denominator .",

    "the behaviour of the mode sum @xmath204 ( [ eq : modesum ] ) near a horizon is by far the most difficult part of @xmath3 to analyze .",
    "the reason for this is that the sums over @xmath50 are not uniformly convergent : more and more @xmath50 s are needed before convergence is reached as we get closer and closer to a horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wkb approximants @xmath124 ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) and @xmath280 ( [ eq : beta1 ] ) do not depend on @xmath50 when @xmath264 , as in this case @xmath117 ( [ eq : chi ] ) reduces to @xmath281 furthermore , the wkb approximants do not correctly reproduce the @xmath282 $ ] behaviour seen in the field modes ( [ eq : frobeniusmodes ] ) near the horizon .",
