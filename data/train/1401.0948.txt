    "if a super earth is transiting , its atmosphere may be observed via transmitted stellar radiation ( e.g. , bean et al .",
    "2010 ; croll et al . 2011 ; dsert et al . 2011 ; berta et al . 2012 ) and planetary thermal emission ( demory et al . 2012 ) .",
    "detection of super earths and characterization of their atmospheric composition with the transit technique are poised to accelerate . in the future",
    ", direct imaging will allow the super earths to be observed in reflected light and their atmospheres to be characterized in greater details ( e.g. , maire et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "a subset of super earths and mini neptunes will have thick atmospheres , which we define as the atmospheres that are thick enough to maintain thermochemical equilibrium at high pressures . at high pressures ,",
    "collisions between molecules in the atmosphere become so frequent that the molecular composition proceeds to thermochemical equilibrium ; in other words , the gibbs free energy of the mixture of molecules is minimized , because the system tends to reach the lowest gibbs free energy state .",
    "theoretical calculations show that jupiter s atmosphere is in thermochemical equilibrium for pressures higher than @xmath1 bar ( e.g. , fegley & lodders 1994 ) , and hot jupiter hd  189733  b s atmosphere is in thermochemical equilibrium for pressures higher than @xmath2 bar ( e.g. , moses et al .",
    "atmospheres on super earths / mini neptunes , similarly to the atmospheres on jupiter and hot jupiters , could obtain thermochemical equilibrium at depth if the atmosphere is thick enough to reach pressures higher than @xmath3 bar depending on temperature .",
    "we suggest many super earths / mini neptunes may have thick atmospheres because : ( 1 ) the constraints on planetary compositions from the mass and the radius of a super earth / mini neptune ( e.g. , valencia et al . 2007b ; rogers & seager 2010a ) usually can not exclude the possibility of a massive gas envelope ; ( 2 ) population synthesis studies of planet formation have suggested planets that are more massive than earth may accrete much more volatiles than earth and are more likely to have thick atmospheres ( e.g. , mordasini et al .",
    "2012 ; fortney et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "some super earths and mini neptunes may have thick atmospheres that are not mainly composed of hydrogen .",
    "super earths and mini neptunes obtain their atmospheres by capture from the nebula , degassing during accretion , and degassing from tectonic processes ( elkins - tanton & seager 2008 ) .",
    "first , starting out as an -dominated atmosphere accreted from the planet - forming nebula , the atmosphere on a super earth / mini neptune can evolve to become a non -- dominated atmosphere .",
    "this is because super earths and mini neptunes may have experienced more significant atmospheric loss than gas giants because they are not as massive as gas giants ( yelle 2004 ; yelle et al .",
    "2008 ; lammer et al . 2008 , 2013 ) .",
    "the result of atmospheric evolution on some super earths and mini neptunes should be preferential loss of light atoms ( i.e. , h and he ) and enrichment of more heavy atoms ( e.g. , c , o , n , s ) .",
    "second , a thick atmosphere may be formed by degassing during accretion on a super earth / mini neptune and its composition may be non -- dominated .",
    "although the outcome of accretion degassing depends on the accretion process and the material being accreted , it can be generally expected that a few percent of the planet s mass can be degassed to form an extensive atmosphere composed of hydrogen , oxygen , and carbon compounds ( elkins - tanton & seager 2008 ) .",
    "recent observations of gj  1214  b , a super earth / mini neptune of @xmath4 m@xmath5 , have hinted that the planet has an atmosphere with a mean molecular mass significantly larger than that of a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere ( e.g , bean et al .",
    "2010 ; berta et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "this work focuses on thick atmospheres of hydrogen , carbon , and oxygen as they are likely to be the most important building blocks of super earth atmospheres , and their relative abundance controls the molecular composition in thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "we are motivated to consider a wide range of carbon to oxygen elemental abundance ratio ( i.e. , the c / o ratio ) for thick atmospheres and here is why .",
    "first , if the thick atmosphere is formed by capturing the gases and ices in the planet - forming nebula , its c / o ratio should to a certain extent track the c / o ratio of the nebula and therefore the parent star ( bond et al . 2010 ; madhusudhan et al . 2012 ) .",
    "though still debated ( fortney 2012 ; nissen 2013 ) , stellar observations have shown that the c / o ratio of planet - hosting systems spreads over a wide range between 0.3 and 2.0 ( bond et al .",
    "2010 ; delgado mena et al . 2010 ; petigura & marcy 2011 ; teske et al .",
    "a significant fraction of planet - hosting systems may have c / o ratios greater than the solar c / o ratio ( petigura & marcy 2011 ; fortney 2012 ) .",
    "protoplanetary nebulae that are enriched in carbon have a different condensation sequence than the solar system , which may lead to the formation of carbon - rich terrestrial planets , i.e. carbon planets ( lodders 2004 ; kuchner & seager 2005 ; bond et al .",
    "2010 ; johnson et al .",
    "second , for a thick atmosphere originated from degassing of accretion of undifferentiated chondritic materials , the composition can be either oxygen - rich or carbon - rich depending on the nature of accreted materials . to be specific , accretion of group ci and cm",
    "carbonaceous chondrites would produce -dominated atmospheres , accretion of group cr , co , and ch carbonaceous chondrites would produce highly carbon - rich atmospheres with the c / o ratio greater than 1 , and outgassing of ordinary and enstatite chondrites would produce atmospheres with the c / o ratio close to 1 and various amounts of ( elkins - tanton & seager 2008 ; schaefer & fegley 2010 ) . after all , due to the uncertainty of the formation and evolution processes of planetary atmospheres , the c / o ratio of the protoplanetary nebula does not necessarily align with that of the planet formed therein , nor the c / o ratio of the planetary atmosphere necessarily aligns with that of the bulk planet mass .",
    "it is therefore plausible to consider super earth atmospheres to have a wide range of c / o ratios , from much lower than the solar ratio ( 0.5 ) to much higher than unity .    a model for thick atmospheres should compute chemical reaction kinetics and vertical transport in three pressure regimes : the low - pressure regime where photon - driven processes dominate ; the intermediate regime where vertical transport dominates ; and the high - pressure regime where thermochemical equilibrium dominates .",
    "we call such a model `` photochemistry - thermochemistry kinetic - transport model '' or simply `` photochemistry - thermochemistry model '' .",
    "a photochemistry - thermochemistry model is critical for the study of molecular compositions of any thick atmospheres , including the thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "the overarching reason is that the composition of the observable part of a thick atmosphere ( 0.1 mbar to 1 bar , depending on the wavelength ) is controlled by both chemical reactions and vertical transport . for thick atmospheres there is a competition between chemical reactions that drive the system to thermochemical equilibrium and vertical transport that tends to mix the atmosphere bringing parts of the atmosphere to disequilibrium .",
    "the division between the thermochemical equilibrium regime and the transport - driven disequilibrium regime is the so called `` quenching pressure '' .",
    "the quenching pressure has been worked out for -dominated thick atmospheres on jupiter and saturn ( prinn & barshay 1977 ; prinn & olaguer 1981 ; fegley & prinn 1985 ; fegley & lodders 1994 ) , and some brown dwarfs and hot jupiters ( fegley & lodders 1996 ; griffith & yelle 1999 ; cooper & showman 2006 ; line et al .",
    "2010 ; visscher & moses 2011 ; moses et al .",
    "the key point is that a full photochemistry - thermochemistry model that treats chemical kinetics and vertical transport is required to compute the quenching pressure and the molecular composition in the observable part of the atmosphere .    for completeness",
    "we summarize previous work on photochemistry - thermochemistry models for exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "models of extrasolar gas giants with thick atmospheres ( by definition -dominated and with codes applicable to the pressure levels at which thermochemical equilibrium is reached ) have been developed ( liang et al .",

    "2009a , b ; line et al .",
    "2010 ; visscher & moses 2011 ; moses et al . 2011 ; kopparapu et al .",
    "recently , models of super earth / mini neptune gj  1214  b having -dominated thick atmospheres have been developed by miller - ricci kempton ( 2012 ) .",
    "terrestrial exoplanets with thin atmospheres ( such that achieving thermochemical equilibrium at the surface is kinetically prohibited ) having a wide range of chemical composition have been studied by selsis et al . (",

    "the super earths and mini neptunes being observed represent a new situation of atmospheric chemistry in the middle between extrasolar giant planets and earth - like exoplanets , for which a self - consistent photochemistry - thermochemistry model applicable to non -- dominated atmospheres has not yet been developed .",
    "when the atmosphere is not -dominated ( but could still contain hydrogen ) , the atmospheric chemistry , especially the transport quenching of key species , will be different from the case of -dominated atmospheres .",
    "a unique challenge in developing a generic photochemistry - thermochemistry model for non -- dominated thick atmospheres is that the model can not assume a fixed background atmosphere ( taken for granted in previous work for atmospheres on gas giants ) .",
    "we aim at developing a photochemistry - thermochemistry model that can compute not only the trace gases , but also the abundances of major gases in thick atmospheres .    in this work we present the first comprehensive photochemistry - thermochemistry model for non -- dominated thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "we present simulations of exoplanet thick atmospheres with thermochemical equilibrium maintained at depth and photochemical processes and vertical transport controlling the compositions in the observable part of the atmospheres .",
    "section  2 describes our photochemistry - thermochemistry model , including the fundamental parameters for the model and numerical tests for model validation .",
    "we present our main findings regarding the molecular compositions of thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes in section  3 .",
    "we apply our self - consistent atmosphere models to known transiting low - mass exoplanet gj  1214  b , hd  97658  b , and 55  cnc  e , and present their synthetic spectra based on the photochemistry - thermochemistry simulations to provide observable predictions in section  4 .",
    "section  5 discusses the formation conditions for water - dominated atmospheres , chemical stability of gases in thick atmospheres , and the effects of disequilibrium chemistry in thick atmospheres .",
    "we conclude in section  6 .",
    "figure [ modelschematic ] schematically show the architecture of our photochemistry - thermochemistry kinetic - transport model for thick atmospheres on exoplanets .",
    "we design our model to have two levels of sophistication : the first level is a thermochemical equilibrium model to compute the atmospheric composition at thermochemical equilibrium , with the temperature - pressure profile computed by a coupled radiative - convective model ; the second level , beyond the thermochemical equilibrium model , is a kinetic - transport model that treats the effects of vertical mixing and photochemical processes on the molecular composition , with the temperature - pressure profile self - consistently computed based on the molecular composition from disequilibrium chemistry .",
    "the first - level thermochemistry model provides appropriate initial conditions , including the atmosphere s thermal structure and molecular composition , for the second - level kinetic - transport model .",
    "a unique feature in our photochemistry - thermochemistry model for non -- dominated thick atmospheres is that the model does not require specification of the main component of the atmosphere ( nor the mean molecular mass ) and instead the model takes the elemental abundances as the input parameters .",
    "all previous photochemistry models assume a specific dominant gas ( and therefore mean molecular mass ) and seek steady - state abundances of trace gases in the fixed background atmosphere",
    ". however , for applications to super earths , one can not assume any specific dominant gas , and the mean molecular mass needs to be self - consistently determined .",
    "we provide for the first time such a feature in our photochemistry - thermochemistry code . in the first - level thermochemistry model that includes a thermochemical equilibrium routine and a radiative - convective routine , we use a pressure level grid so that the mean molecular mass is no longer required .",
    "the mean molecular mass is synthesized from the thermochemical equilibrium composition profile , and then used to transform the pressure grid to an altitude grid . in the second - level photochemistry - thermochemistry model , we perform kinetic - transport simulation on a pressure - temperature - altitude profile which itself is updated by the radiative - convective calculation . our approach eliminates the need to specify a background atmosphere for kinetic - transport simulations of thick atmospheres , which makes our model uniquely suitable for applications in the study of super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "a thermochemical equilibrium model and a radiative transfer model are used iteratively to obtain stratified atmospheric compositions and temperature - pressure profiles that obey thermochemical equilibrium , radiative - convective equilibrium , and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we use the method of minimizing the total gibbs free energy as described in miller - ricci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to compute the thermochemical equilibrium composition based on elemental abundances .",
    "the temperature profiles are computed based on atmospheric compositions that obey thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "we compute the temperature - pressure profiles by balancing the stellar irradiation with planetary thermal emission . with a grey atmosphere assumption ( i.e. , mean opacities in stellar radiation wavelengths and in thermal emission wavelengths ) ,",
    "we compute the temperature - pressure profiles using the formulation of guillot ( 2010 ) .",
    "the opacities include absorption cross sections of , , , , , , , , , , , , , and generated from the hitran 2008 database ( rothman et al .",
    "2009 ) , and - collision - induced absorption from borysow ( 2002 ) .",
    "the temperature - pressure profiles are adjusted according to the appropriate adiabatic lapse rate to account for the onset of convection ( see miller - ricci et al .",
    "when the thermochemical equilibrium model and the radiative - convective model converge , we calculate the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere as a function of pressure and project the temperature - pressure profile to an altitude grid .",
    "the kinetic - transport model solves the one - dimensional continuity - transport equation for the steady state , viz .",

    "the production and loss rates are the summary of all contributions from relevant chemical and photochemical reactions in the atmosphere . the transport flux that couples different layers of the atmosphere is parameterized by eddy diffusion and molecular diffusion , i.e. , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath17 s@xmath12 )",

    "photochemical processes contribute dominantly to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms .",
    "the effect of photochemical processes confines to pressure levels above 0.1 bar , because ultraviolet photons that could dissociate atmospheric molecules usually only penetrate to the pressures of 0.1 bar due to rayleigh scattering and absorption by molecules in the upper atmosphere . in the intermediate pressure levels",
    ", the transport flux @xmath13 can be the major source and sink for species as compared with photochemical and chemical reactions .",
    "the reason is that the reactive radicals produced by photochemistry are usually not abundant because of the lack of photons that penetrate to these altitudes , and that the temperature and pressure ( and therefore reaction rates ) are usually not high in the intermediate pressures . in all , when all production and loss mechanisms are properly taken into account in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 , equation ( [ eqf ] ) is the governing equation for molecular compositions in any atmospheres .",
    "we have extended the photochemistry model described in hu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to the pressure regime in which thermochemical equilibrium holds . to make the model applicable to the pressure regime of thermochemical equilibrium",
    ", we include the contribution of the reverse equation for each forward equation into the production and loss terms in equation ( [ eqf ] ) .",
    "the reverse reactions are the reversal of the chemical reactions whose kinetic rates have been measured or computed for the studies of earth and planetary atmospheres ( chosen as forward reactions ) .",
    "the kinetic rates of reverse reactions ( @xmath26 ) and forward reactions ( @xmath27 ) are linked by the difference in the gibbs free energy of formation ( @xmath28 ) of the reactants and the products as @xmath29 } ( k_b't)^{n_p - n_r } , \\label{reverse}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the gas constant , @xmath23 is the temperature ( k ) , @xmath31 bar @xmath32 k@xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the number of products and reactants , respectively ( visscher & moses 2011 ) .    using equation ( [ reverse ] ) , we calculate the rates of the reverse reaction of each forward reaction in the reaction list of hu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that includes bimolecular reactions , termolecular reactions , and thermodissociation reactions .",
    "the gibbs free energies of formation are taken from the nist - janaf database ( chase 1998 ) , burcat & ruscic ( 2005 ) , and visscher & moses ( 2011 ) . for a number of reactions ,",
    "there are empirical measurement for both forward and reverse reactions , which provide an opportunity of validating this computation scheme . whenever possible , we adopt the empirical kinetic rate that have the widest temperature range ( i.e. , define as the forward reaction ) , compute the reverse reaction rate , and compare the reverse rate with its empirical measurements . for all tested reactions",
    "we find agreement within one order of magnitude , which validates our calculation of reverse reaction rates .",
    "another update to our reaction network for the model to be applicable to high pressures is that we have included the high - pressure limit rates for all three - body reactions and dissociation reactions . in the reaction list of hu",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) many three - body reactions only have low - pressure limit rates , which are appropriate for applications to thin atmospheres .",
    "we have added the high - pressure limit rates for the three - body reactions and thermo - dissociation reactions , based on recommended rates of the nist kinetics database , baulch et al .",

    "we have coupled our kinetic - transport model to the grey - atmosphere radiative - convective model . as the composition ( and therefore the mean molecular mass )",
    "might change as the photochemistry code steps forward , the temperature - pressure profile and the pressure - altitude conversion need to be updated to keep the atmosphere in radiative equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we therefore iteratively run the kinetic - transport routine and the radiative - convective routine for this update . in practice , the altitude grid is not re - calculated for each time step in kinetic - transport simulations .",
    "instead , as chemistry only has secondary dependency on the atmospheric temperature , we run the kinetic - transport code to convergence , and use the radiative - convective code to calculate the a temperature - pressure - altitude profile based on the converged kinetic - transport result .",
    "then , the new atmospheric profile , with the new mean molecular mass incorporated , is provided to the kinetic - transport code for another run .",
    "starting from the atmospheric structure profile provided by the first - level thermochemistry model , we find that the temperature profile typically converges with the disequilibrium chemistry composition within 3 iterations . here",
    ", by convergence we practically mean the variation of temperature between two successive iterations to be within 2% .",
    "the end results of atmospheric composition and temperature profile satisfy radiative - convective equilibrium , hydrostatic equilibrium , and the detail balance between production and loss by chemical and photochemical processes and vertical transport .    for the current model we focus on thick atmospheres on warm and hot super earths / mini neptunes , in which water vapor will not condense .",
    "table [ critical ] tabulates the critical temperatures of common gases in planetary atmospheres .",
    "water vapor , having a critical temperature of 647 k , stands out as having a much higher critical temperature than any other common volatiles made of c , h , o , and n elements .",
    "therefore it is possible for a certain class of planets that have equilibrium temperatures lower than 647 k , water vapor could condense to form oceans , and then the planets could be potentially habitable . for this paper ,",
    "we focus on the atmospheres in which water remains in its gas phase .",
    "we emphasize that most of the transiting super earths and mini neptunes discovered so far fall within our consideration .",
    "note that some minor constituents of the atmosphere , not included in our photochemistry - thermochemistry model , might condense out to form layers of cloud or haze .",
    "in fact , for super earth / mini neptune gj  1214  b and perhaps other loss - mass exoplanets potential layers of condensates could mask molecular features in their transmission spectra and affect interpretation of the spectra ( e.g. , fortney 2005 ; benneke & seager 2012 ; morley et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "after the photochemistry - thermochemistry simulation converges to a steady state , we compute the synthetic spectra of the modeled exoplanet s atmospheric transmission , reflection and thermal emission with a line - by - line radiative transfer code developed based on the concept outlined by seager & sasselov ( 2000 ) and seager et al .",
    "opacities are based on molecular absorption with cross sections computed from the hitran 2008 database ( rothman et al .",
    "2009 ) , molecular collision - induced absorption when necessary ( borysow 2002 ) , rayleigh scattering , and aerosol extinction computed based on the mie theory ( van de hulst 1981 ) .",
    "empirical absorption coefficients of at 750 - 940 nm are also included ( obrien & cao 2002 ) . the transmission is computed for each wavelength by integrating the optical depth along the limb path , as outlined in seager & sasselov ( 2000 ) . the reflected stellar light and the planetary thermal emission are computed by the @xmath35-eddington 2-stream method ( toon et al .",
    "1989 ) .      for a super earth / mini neptune with known stellar irradiation level ,",
    "the controlling factors for the molecular composition of its thick atmosphere are the elemental abundance , the efficiency of vertical mixing , and the internal heat flux .",
    "the elemental abundance determines the molecular composition at thermochemical equilibrium , the efficiency of vertical mixing determines to which extent vertical transport brings up gases from the thermochemical equilibrium regime , and internal heat flux determines the temperatures at high pressures that affect the compositions at thermochemical equilibrium . the elemental abundance rather than the background molecular composition is a fundamental parameter in our models for thick atmospheres , because an arbitrary combination of molecules may not be chemically stable in thick atmospheres ( a point that will be discussed later in section  5 ) .",
    "we emphasize the uniqueness of the photochemistry - thermochemistry solution . in mathematical terms",
    ", the mixing ratio profiles at the steady state obeys the continuity equation , a second - order ordinary differential equation whose solution is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions at both ends . for the upper boundary conditions , we place a zero - flux lid at the pressure level of @xmath36 pa for all gases except and , for which we apply the diffusion - limited escape rates . as such , our solutions of atmospheric chemical composition , for a certain planetary scenario with an assigned value for the eddy diffusion coefficient ,",
    "is uniquely determined by the lower boundary conditions , for which we apply the thermochemistry equilibrium compositions .",
    "we have run a number of test cases to verify the uniqueness from model simulations .",
    "for example , for an h : o : c ratio of 2:2:1 , the molecular composition can be either 50% 50% , or 50% 50% . under thermochemical equilibrium ,",
    "the deep atmosphere will be composed of 50% and 50% ; in a separate simulation , we start with 50% 50% and as the initial condition , the system naturally evolves to the steady - state composition of 50% 50% at high pressures , i.e. , the unique solution .",
    "the photochemistry - thermochemistry solution of the atmospheric chemical composition on an exoplanet is the only steady - state solution for a certain elemental abundance , vertical mixing rate , and internal heat flux .",
    "we have validated our photochemistry - thermochemistry model in pressure regimes for different physical processes .",
    "the model is applicable to the low pressures where photochemistry dominates , the intermediate pressures where vertical transport dominates , and the high pressures where thermochemical equilibrium dominates . for the low pressures where photochemistry dominates",
    ", the model in this paper reduces to the photochemistry model for thin atmospheres , which has been validated in hu et al .",
    "for the high pressures where thermochemical equilibrium dominates , we find that our kinetic model that balances all forward and reverse reactions gives identical results compared with direct minimization of the global gibbs free energy ( figure [ jupiter ] and figure [ hd189 ] ) .",
    "this straightforward mathematical validation implies that our calculation of reverse reaction rates is correct and our model is applicable for the regime of thermochemical equilibrium .    for the intermediate pressures in which vertical transport dominates , direct mathematical validation is not possible , because the steady - state solution is unknown .",
    "instead , we seek to validate our model in this regime by reproducing the results of observations of planets and other models .",
    "we have simulated the atmosphere of jupiter and the atmosphere of hot jupiter hd  189733  b , to compare with observations .",
    "we focus on reproducing the effect of vertical transport on the conversion in these atmospheres that have very different temperatures ( figure [ jupiter ] and figure [ hd189 ] ) .",
    "we describe the details of these model tests below .    for the deep atmosphere of jupiter ,",
    "the most important feature relevant for this investigation is the enhancement of mixing ratio in the observable parts of the atmosphere due to vertical transport .",
    "our model correctly predicts this enhancement in comparison with the observed mixing ratio of ( figure [ jupiter ] ) . we have also compared our simulated mixing ratios with those of the latest model for jupiter s deep atmosphere ( visscher et al .",
    "2010 ) and found agreement within a factor of 2 .",
    "the remaining discrepancy may be due to updated kinetic rates of several reactions that we have adopted . compared with reaction rates used in visscher et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we found that the rates for reaction have updated recommended values and the discrepancy in these rates can account for the minor discrepancy in the conversion rates between our models and the models of visscher et al .",
    "we have taken for this reaction the low - pressure limit rate from baulch et al .",

    "we have compared our results with a similar suite of simulations by visscher & moses ( 2011 ) and found agreement to within a factor of 2 .",
    "the efficiency of vertical mixing affects the steady - state mixing ratios of methane and other hydrocarbons significantly in the observable parts of the atmosphere .",

    "these figures show the theoretical range of atmospheric chemical composition ; different types of atmosphere may not be equally likely in reality .    before describing the non -- dominated atmospheres , we first show that if @xmath66 , thick atmospheres of super earths and mini neptunes contain abundant and therefore have the same chemical behaviors as atmospheres of gas giants .",
    "previous thermochemistry and photochemistry results regarding the thick atmospheres on gas giants are valid in these cases , including : is the dominant carbon species at equilibrium temperatures lower than @xmath1 k ; is the dominant carbon species at equilibrium temperatures higher than @xmath1 k ( line et al .",

    "we confirm all these behaviors in our simulations for super earths and mini neptunes having hydrogen - rich atmospheres ( see figure [ general_cho ] ) .",
    "in particular , we observe at the low temperatures where is the dominant carbon carrier and is the dominant oxygen carrier , the ratio / is equal to the c / o ratio ( figure [ general_cho ] ) , and in such cases the eddy diffusion coefficients have no effects on the abundances of or in the observable parts of the atmospheres . at the high temperatures where is the dominant carbon carrier , the mixing ratio of drops dramatically when @xmath41 exceeds 1 due to the fact that most oxygen atoms have to be bound with carbon atoms .",
    "the exact irradiation temperature for the - transition also depends on the internal heat flux ; and the exact mixing ratios of trace species , for example at the low temperatures and at the high temperatures , depend on the strength of eddy mixing and the uv flux of the parent star .",
    "now we turn to non -- dominated atmospheres . if the hydrogen abundance ( @xmath40 ) is lower than @xmath67 , is no longer the dominated gas in the atmosphere , and the atmosphere will contain abundant water vapor for low @xmath41 , and hydrocarbons ( i.e. , , , and ) for high @xmath41 .",
    "the water - rich atmospheres occur when @xmath68 and the hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres occur when @xmath69 , for an equilibrium temperature ranging from 500 to 2000 k ( figure [ general_cho ] ) . for the intermediate cases ( @xmath70 ) , the atmosphere will have abundant and , and their fractions are sensitive to @xmath40 . in addition , , , and can also take a significant fraction and their relative abundances depend on the temperature and the elemental abundance of the atmosphere ( figure [ general_cho ] ) . a general trend in this regime",

    "non -- dominated atmospheres differ from -dominated atmospheres mostly in the dependency on the carbon to oxygen abundance ratio . in general , the composition of a non -- dominated atmosphere is much more sensitive to carbon to oxygen abundance ratio than that of a -dominated atmosphere ( figure [ cho_ratio ] ) .",
    "this is because when the atmosphere is not hydrogen - rich , the composition is first and foremost constrained by the limited supply of hydrogen . to better illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider how the versus abundance ratio depends on @xmath41 for an example ( see the upper panel of figure [ cho_ratio ] ) . for -dominated atmospheres at the irradiation temperature less than @xmath72",

    "one might ask how this classification scheme depends on the parameters other than the elemental abundance and the irradiation temperature , e.g. , the internal heat flux that affects the temperature at depth , the eddy diffusivity that determines the efficiency of vertical mixing , and the uv flux that determines the efficiency of photodissociation . based on our numerical experiments",
    ", we find that : ( 1 ) the effect of the internal heat flux is to increase or decrease the temperature at the quenching pressure , which to a certain extent leads to the same effect as increasing or decreasing the irradiation level ; ( 2 ) the effect of changing eddy diffusivity and stellar uv flux in reasonable ranges is not critical for the species that has mixing ratios in the orders of @xmath73 , but may be critical for other minor species .",
    "the properties presented by figure [ general_cho ] can therefore be considered as general , if the irradiation temperature is regarded as a general proxy for the atmospheric temperature that could also contain contribution from internal heating . because the effects of the internal heat flux , the eddy diffusivity , and the stellar spectrum on minor species depend on specific atmospheric scenarios , we defer the discussion of that aspect to the subsequent sections dedicated to specific types of atmospheres .",
    "interestingly , for certain endmember scenarios of non -- dominated thick atmospheres , we find that the elemental abundance uniquely determines the amounts of major components in the atmosphere for a wide range of temperatures , and we derive analytical formulae of the molecular compositions for those scenarios .",
    "table [ para ] tabulates an exhaustive list of parameter regimes of the elemental abundance , and the derived formulae for mixing ratios of major components in these regimes .",
    "the fundamental principle that we use here is simply that all h , c , and o atoms in the atmosphere have to be bound to form a limited set of thermochemically stable molecules ( e.g. , , , , , , , , , etc . ) , to the extent that molecular forms of c , h , and o elements are thermochemically preferred over atomic forms ( which typically corresponds to an equilibrium temperature of less than @xmath74 k ) and that water vapor does not condense in the atmosphere ( which typically corresponds to an equilibrium temperature of greater than @xmath75 k ) . in the cases of @xmath76 and the cases of @xmath77 ,",

    "water - dominated atmospheres are defined as the atmospheres in which water is the most abundant gas .",

    "water - rich atmospheres exist when @xmath91 , but water - dominated atmospheres exist only when @xmath92 .",
    "the composition of the water - rich but not water - dominated atmospheres can be affected by the temperature , the efficiency of vertical mixing , and the stellar input spectrum ( see figure [ general_cho ] , [ chem_kzz ] , and [ chem_int ] ) .",
    "the mixing ratio of is highly sensitive to the irradiation level and the internal heat flux . with an irradiation temperature of 770 - 1200 k and a small intrinsic temperature of 35 k",
    ", the mixing ratio of can be as high as @xmath93 in a water - rich but not water - dominated atmosphere .",

    "we now turn to consider the minor components in the water - dominated atmospheres .",
    "the minor components of interest are , of course , the three stable forms of carbon , , , and .",
    "we here outline an analytical treatment for the carbon speciation in the water - dominated atmospheres , which is also applicable to study the thermochemical speciation of other elements in a given mixture of gases .",
    "when @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath76 , we may consider carbon as perturbation on a background atmosphere made of either , , or , ( table [ para ] ) .",
    "for carbon in a - system , we have the following balanced reactions : let @xmath96 be the equilibrium constant of reaction ( [ h2_ch4co ] ) , and @xmath97 be the equilibrium constant of reaction ( [ h2_coco2 ] ) .",

    "we find that when the atmosphere is mainly a - mixture ( @xmath103 ) , the main form of carbon is either at low temperatures or at high temperatures ( similar to gas giant atmospheres ) ; when the atmosphere is mainly a - mixture ( @xmath104 ) , the main form of carbon is always , regardless of temperature ( figure [ water_t ] ; also see figure [ chem_kzz ] for an example ) .",

    "the free oxygen in the atmosphere is basically the left - over oxygen after forming and ; in other words , free oxygen is expected when @xmath105 .",
    "the rise of free oxygen we present here is a result of the loss of hydrogen , rather than the photon - driven processes that only affects the upper atmosphere at @xmath106 bar ( see the upper panel of figure [ chem_kzz ] for an example ) .",
    "the caveat here is that we do not consider any material exchange between the atmosphere and the surface ( if there is a surface ) . the oxygen build - up from hydrogen loss",
    "could be prevented by active volcanic release of reduced gases or oxidative weathering of the surface , a process that has been proposed to have operated on venus ( e.g. , kasting 1997 ) .",
    "a side point is that the radical would be very abundant in such -- atmospheres , with mixing ratios varying between @xmath39 and @xmath64 .",
    "as radicals remove most other gases in the atmosphere rapidly , such a high concentration of necessarily implies that the any gas that reacts with without reforming pathways is not expected to be able to accumulate in the atmosphere .",

    "another new type of super earth atmosphere we find is hydrocarbon - rich atmosphere .",
    "the hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres are the conjugate situation of the water - rich atmospheres ; the difference here is that while the only stable  hydro - oxygen \" is , there are many stable hydrocarbons . based on our simulations , the potentially observable parts of a hydrocarbon - rich atmosphere may be composed of , , , , , and other higher - order hydrocarbons ( figures [ cho ] and [ cho1 ] ) . as the number of possible molecules in hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres exceeds the number of major elements in the atmosphere ( 2 ) , the main components are not uniquely set by the elemental abundance , and depend on other factors including the efficiency of vertical mixing and the temperatures in the atmosphere .",
    "for a super earth / mini neptune having a carbon - rich atmosphere , unsaturated hydrocarbons can become the dominant carbon - bearing gases in the atmosphere if the atmosphere loses most of its free hydrogen .",
    "when the atmosphere has free hydrogen ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) , carbon is in the most reduced form , , if the planet receives similar degree of irradiation as gj  1214  b ( see figure [ cho ] and figure [ hydrocarbon_t ] ) . if @xmath108 , the abundance of hydrogen in the atmosphere is not enough to saturate carbon , and and emerge as the main carbon carrier for decreasing hydrogen abundances ( see figure [ cho ] and figure [ hydrocarbon_t ] ) .",

    "1984 ) , which is driven by the photon - initiated dissociation of methane and is confined to pressures lower than 0.1 bar ( i.e. , the stratosphere ) . here , the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon is no longer a photochemical perturbation , but an inevitable result of hydrogen loss of the atmosphere .",
    "unsaturated hydrocarbons can be the dominant gases in evolved carbon - rich atmospheres on super earths , and they lead to spectral features that allow unique identification of carbon - rich atmospheres",
    ".    the mixing ratios of , , and in the hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres also depend on the internal heat flux and the efficiency of vertical mixing .",
    "first , the internal heat flux can directly affects the abundance of hydrocarbons through controlling the temperature at the quenching pressure .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ chem_int ] shows a case of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . this atmosphere is mainly composed of and , but also has a great deal of and .",
    "increasing @xmath57 from 35 k to 180 k , the mixing ratio of increases from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , and the mixing ratio of decreases from @xmath112 to @xmath111 . while the temperature changes dramatically by thousands of k at @xmath113 bar when @xmath57 increases from 35 k to 180 k ( i.e. , the planet s internal heat flux increases by 700 folds ) , the effect on the mixing ratios of the major components at the observable pressure levels is rather small .",
    "this is because elevating the internal heat flux moves up the quenching level and diminishes the effect of internal heating .",
    "second , the internal heat flux affects the manner that the mixing ratios of hydrocarbons depend on the eddy diffusivity . when the eddy mixing is more efficient , the quenching pressure becomes higher .",
    "if the planet has negligible internal heat flux , the atmosphere below the radiative layer would be close to isothermal , and then as a result of increasing pressure and constant temperature , a greater eddy mixing coefficient would lead to more in the observable part of the atmosphere .",
    "if the planet has significant internal heat flux , the atmospheric temperature would increase with pressure adiabatically at depth , and then the mixing ratio of should increase with more efficient vertical mixing ( figure [ hydrocarbon_t ] ; also see the upper - right panel of figure [ chem_kzz ] ) . in all , , , and have distinctive spectral features ; and their relative abundance may provide a probe to the processes of eddy mixing and internal heating in the deep atmosphere of a super earth that are otherwise not detectable .",
    "the results above are valid for hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres , which typically requires @xmath114 . if we loosen this requirement and consider the cases with @xmath115 , we find that the atmosphere is most likely to be dominated in . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the abundance of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the non -- dominated thick atmosphere of an exoplanet having similar temperatures as hd  97658  b would be at the level of 1000 ppmv in the observable part of the atmosphere , also significant in terms of driving spectral features .",
    "more efficient photolysis and less efficient vertical mixing would favor formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons . in all",
    ", we find that unsaturated hydrocarbons are abundant in non -- dominated carbon - rich thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes , and therefore they should be considered as one of the basic building blocks for super earth / mini neptune atmospheres .",
    "finally we turn to the minor components in hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres .",
    "the main form of oxygen in hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres is invariably . for a non -- dominated carbon - rich oxygen - poor atmosphere ( i.e. , @xmath117 , @xmath114 ) , we always find that @xmath118 , and @xmath119 becomes even smaller for higher temperatures or higher @xmath41 ( figure [ general_cho ] and figure [ cho_ratio ] ) .",

    "although we do not treat photochemical haze in this paper , we expect that non -- dominated carbon - rich atmospheres to be ideal environment to form photochemical haze , and therefore the transmission spectra produced by such kind of atmospheres are likely to be affected by haze .",
    "second , measurements of the thermal emission of this planet in the mid - infrared wavelengths yields a great deal of knowledge of its atmosphere .",
    "a hydrocarbon - rich atmosphere has little or , so its thermal emission spectrum should be dominated by the absorption bands of , , and ( figure [ spec_feature ] ) .",

    "however , it would be very hard to establish that the atmosphere is mostly composed of water vapor based on water vapor features alone .",

    "therefore , a confirmed nonexistence of methane feature in either transmission or thermal emission ( see figure [ spec_feature ] ) , in combination with a detection of water features , will provide sufficient evidence for a water - dominated atmosphere on a gj  1214  b like super earth .",

    "water - dominated atmosphere , if discovered , would be an exciting environment in our interstellar neighborhood because of its reminiscence of a habitable world . in fact ,",
    "one of preferred scenarios for the super earth / mini neptune gj  1214  b is that the planet has a signficant fraction of its mass as water based on mass - radius constraints ( rogers & seager 2010b ; nettelmann et al .",

    "we study the range of atmospheric composition of gj  1214  b in detail using our photochemistry - thermochemistry , and find that the water - dominated atmosphere exists at a carbon to oxygen ratio much smaller than the solar value . for a range of carbon to oxygen ratios ,",
    "we show a range of possible scenarios and their transmission and thermal emission spectra , and outline a number of possible ways to distinguish them by future observations in section 4.1 .    for a more general discussion beyond gj  1214  b , we suggest that identifying a water - dominated atmosphere may be harder than previously expected .",
    "there are two reasons for this suggestion .",
    "the first reason is that water vapor features in the transmission spectra are not effective in distinguishing a water - dominated atmosphere versus a water - rich atmosphere .",
    "this has been shown by benneke & seager ( 2012 ) with a quantitative retrieval method for super earth transmission spectra .",
    "this is also shown in figure [ spec_feature ] as an example , in which atmospheric scenarios with water vapor mixing ratios ranging from 1% to 70% have similar sizes of water vapor features in the transmission spectra .",
    "the second reason is that the mixing ratio of water vapor in a non -- dominated atmosphere is highly sensitive to the carbon to oxygen ratio ( figure [ cho_ratio ] ) . in particular , for a solar carbon to oxygen ratio , a non -- dominated atmosphere is not water - dominated , but such an atmosphere will have prominent water vapor features in its spectrum ( figure [ chem_kzz ] and figure [ spec_feature ] ) .",
    "therefore , identifying a water - dominated atmosphere not only involves measuring the water vapor features , but also require evaluating the carbon to oxygen ratio of the atmosphere , which warrants measurements of other gases in the atmosphere .",
    "moreover , a water - dominated atmosphere might be indigenously rare in nature . for a planet to have a water - dominated atmosphere",
    ", the planet has to start with an almost pure water ice envelope , with the fraction of methane ice of no more than 20% by weight .",
    "we show in section 3.2 that the carbon to oxygen ratio has to be less than 0.2 , much smaller than the solar ratio , for a thick atmosphere to evolve into a water - dominated atmosphere .",
    "such a condition on the planet s forming environment is quite confining , which might only be possible close to the snow line of a protoplanetary disk with a solar - like carbon to oxygen ratio .",
    "studies of the condensation sequence of volatile ices from protoplanetary nebula gases have shown that the ice compositions sensitively depend on the carbon to oxygen ratio of the nebulae ( e.g. , marboeuf et al .",
    "2008 ; johnson et al .",
    "2012 ) . even for a planet - forming nabula with a solar carbon to oxygen ratio",
    ", the ice mixture should have @xmath130% carbon by weight ( marboeuf et al .",
    "2008 ) ; and the carbon content in ice increases with increasing carbon to oxygen ratios of the nebulae , in particular for those with cold midplanes ( johnson et al . 2012 ) . to summarize",
    ", one could expect the super earths that are born as mini neptunes to have a wide range of carbon to oxygen ratios in their atmospheres , and a water - dominated atmosphere is one of many plausible atmospheric scenarios .",
    "this finding suggests that water - dominated atmospheres might be rare .",
    "one useful application of our photochemistry - thermochemistry model is to verify the chemical stability of atmospheric gases .",
    "the  million model \" approach has been developed to interpret the observations of exoplanet atmospheres ( e.g. , madhusudhan & seager 2009 ; benneke & seager 2012 ) .",
    "these methods seek best - fitted model spectra of planetary emission and transmission by exploring the full parameter space of molecular compositions .",
    "we have shown in this paper that not all combinations of gases are chemically stable in thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "for example , we find that methane is not compatible with water - dominated atmospheres on gj  1214  b. therefore , our photochemistry - thermochemistry model can be used in conjunction with the `` million model '' approach to eliminate a significant part of the parameter space , in terms of ruling out the unstable atmospheric scenarios and strengthening the interpretation of spectra .    as a general study on the stability of gases in thick atmospheres",
    ", we additionally simulate atmospheres initially composed of all possible 50%-50% molecular binary combination of , , , , and for an exoplanet like gj  1214  b. for each scenario , we derive the elemental abundance from the initial composition for the model input . for example , to simulate a 50% 50% atmosphere , we use an h : o : c ratio of 2:1:1 . the thermochemistry - photochemistry model result",
    "is then compared with the initial molecular composition , to determine whether such an initial state is chemically stable .",
    "we find that is compatible with all major stable gases of c , h , o elements , but is not compatible with equal amount of and .",

    "similarly , the - combination has the same elemental abundance as the - combination ; the atmosphere will have the composition of and at the steady state , and the - combination is not stable ( and therefore not a plausible scenario ) .",
    "these results imply that chemical stability has to be taken into account when deriving atmospheric molecular compositions from spectra of super earths and mini neptunes",
    ".      one might ask whether a kinetic - transport simulation is necessary for the study of super earths and mini neptunes , considering the fact that observations of their atmospheres will remain disk - averaged and have low spectral resolution for a long time . here , our two - level model framework ( figure [ modelschematic ] ) provides an opportunity to compare thermochemical equilibrium calculation with kinetic - transport calculation for a wide range of exoplanet thick atmospheres .",
    "_ temperature profile _ to what extent the temperature profile calculated under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium would differ from the profile consistent with the chemical composition resulted from the kinetic - transport modeling ?",
    "we find that among all models we have run , the variation of temperature caused by disequilibrium processes ( i.e. , photochemistry and vertical transport ) is maximally 10% with respect to the temperature profile that one would get assuming thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "in fact , for more than 90% of the cases , the effect of disequilibrium chemistry on the temperature is within 5% . for most cases the temperature would increases when considering disequilibrium processes like vertical transport , and the magnitude of such temperature variation increases with increasing eddy diffusivity .",
    "the most significant variation for the gj  1214  b simulations happen for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in these scenarios ,",
    "the increase of temperature is mostly due to and brought up by vertical transport to the pressure levels of 1 - 100 mbar .    _",
    "mean molecular mass and atmospheric structure _ the same question can be asked for the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere .",
    "we find that the most significant variation in the mean molecular mass caused by disequilibrium processes is decrease of the mean molecular mass above the pressure level of @xmath63 pa due to lift of light species by molecular diffusion .",
    "other than this , we also find that the fraction of major components of the atmosphere ( and therefore the mean molecular mass ) can vary significantly due to vertical transport only in the middle regime of figure [ zoo ] where , , , , and can coexist .",
    "the main effect is that vertical transport may homogenize the atmosphere and remove the dependency of mean molecular mass on pressure under thermochemical equilibrium , when the temperature is not too high .",
    "one such example is shown in figure [ mmz_var ] . in this example , the difference between the true mean molecular mass and the mean molecular mass consistent from thermochemical equilibrium is up to 40% in the observable part of the atmosphere .",
    "similar effects , but to a lesser extent , occur for other scenarios in the parameter regime of @xmath135 and @xmath132 .",
    "this finding demonstrates the necessity of the kinetic - transport computation for a self - consistent modeling of thick atmospheres on warm super earths and mini neptunes .    _",
    "planetary spectrum _",
    "the question that how disequilibrium chemistry would affect the emergent spectrum of a super earth / mini neptune is fairly involved , because the planetary spectrum depends on both the atmospheric thermal structure and the atmospheric chemical composition .",
    "we did not find a definitive trend comparing the spectra calculated for thermochemical equilibrium compositions and the spectra calculated for disequilibrium compositions . for transmission spectrum",
    ", our exploration of elemental abundances and temperatures shows that the error induced by assuming thermochemical equilibrium is in general within 1% of the planet s radius , and this error is mostly due to mean molecular mass differences . for thermal emission spectrum",
    ", we find that in some cases disequilibrium processes can cause very significant variation , for which an example is shown in figure [ mmz_var ] . in this example the synthetic spectrum based on thermochemical equilibrium would significantly under - predict absorption of methane , which is expected to be enhanced by vertical transport .",
    "therefore we suggest that self - consistent models are needed for understanding the physics and chemistry of thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "molecular compositions of a thick atmosphere at the pressure levels relevant to observations are controlled by vertical transport and chemical reactions at a deeper level .",
    "the idea of disequilibrium chemistry driven by vertical transport was originally proposed to explain the overabundance of and the deficit of in jupiter s atmosphere ( prinn & barshay 1977 ; prinn & olaguer 1981 ) and used to explain chemical composition of solar - system giant planets ( e.g. , fegley & prinn 1985 ; yung et al .",
    "1988 ; fegley & lodders 1994 ) .",
    "similar processes have also been suggested to operate on brown dwarfs and hot jupiters ( e.g. , fegley & lodders 1996 ; griffith & yelle , 1999 ; cooper & showman 2006 ; line et al .",
    "2010 ; madhusudhan & seager 2011 ; visscher & moses 2011 ; moses et al .",
    "in general , the chemical timescale of a certain molecule decreases with increasing pressure and temperature . at the pressure levels where vertical transport timescale is shorter than the chemical kinetic timescale , the molecule is well mixed ; at deeper levels in which the chemical timescale becomes shorter than the vertical transport timescale , the molecule s abundance is set by thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the molecule s abundance at observable pressure levels is set by thermochemical equilibrium at the level at which the vertical transport timescale equals the chemical kinetic timescale , i.e. , the quenching level .",
    "the most significant effects of vertical mixing are on the second most abundant carrier of major elements , and the most abundant carrier of minor elements .",
    "the abundances of the most abundant carriers of major elements , like , , and in water - rich atmospheres , are determined by the constraints of elemental abundances .",
    "indeed , the elemental abundance could uniquely determine the abundances of major components in some super earth thick atmospheres ( see table [ para ] ) .",
    "based on the major composition set by the elemental abundance , relatively minor constituents in the atmosphere are indicators of the effects of eddy mixing and disequilibrium chemistry .",
    "the minor constituents can be either the carriers of minor elements , like carbon species in a water - rich atmosphere ( figure [ chem_kzz ] ) and oxygen species in a hydrocarbon - rich atmosphere ( figure [ chem_kzz ] ) , or the second most abundant carriers of major elements , like in a - atmosphere ( figure [ chem_kzz ] ) .",
    "determining the major components and some of the minor components in atmospheres of super earths and mini neptunes like gj  1214  b via spectroscopy may offer a window to their deep atmospheres that are otherwise not detectable , and potentially enable the study of vertical mixing and internal heating on these planets .",
    "for a warm exoplanet like gj  1214  b , we find that for a wide range of composition , and an eddy diffusion coefficient ranging from @xmath136 @xmath17 s@xmath12 , the quenching pressure is @xmath137 bar .",
    "this is true for almost all types of atmospheres .",
    "what determines the abundance of the minor species is the interplay between eddy mixing that determines the quenching pressure , and the internal heat flux that determines the temperature at the quenching pressure .",
    "the so called `` minor species '' , although low in absolute amounts , may have significant imprints in spectra and therefore be detectable . for example , in a dominated atmosphere leads to prominent features in both transmission and thermal emission ( figure [ spec_feature ] ) .",
    "for a very hot super earth like 55  cnc  e ( equilibrium temperature higher than @xmath138 k ) , however , the atmosphere is very close to thermochemical equilibrium at all relevant pressure levels .",
    "for these planets , thermochemical equilibrium calculation would be efficient and adequate for studying the chemical properties of their atmospheres .",
    "a cumulative loss of hydrogen from atmospheres on super earths would result in the build - up of oxygen , unsaturated hydrocarbons , and other thermochemical and photochemical products . in this study",
    ", we neglect the possible material exchange between the atmosphere and the surface of a super earth .",
    "how would active atmosphere - surface exchange affect the atmospheric composition of a super earth ?",
    "first , surface emission of reduced gases ( e.g. , , , ) and exposure of unoxidized minerals ( e.g. , ) by volcanism can consume atmospheric oxygen and potentially prevent the formation of -rich atmospheres . without atmosphere - surface exchange , we predict some super earths that form in oxygen - rich nebulae will have -rich atmospheres due to loss of atmospheric hydrogen into the space ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "such -rich atmospheres may be short - lived due to atmosphere - surface exchange .",
    "a solar - system example reminiscent of this process is venus .",
    "if venus starts with an ocean and loses its ocean during the runaway greenhouse phase , a scenario supported by the detection of an atmospheric d / h ratio @xmath139 times higher than the terrestrial value ( e.g. , donahue et al .",
    "1982 ) , a massive -rich atmosphere up to 240 bars must have existed on venus ( kasting 1997 ) . however , today s venus atmosphere only has trace amounts of oxygen , which means that that much of oxygen has to be consumed over the history of venus .",
    "volcanic eruptions can release reduced gases ( e.g. , , , ) and expose unoxidized lithosphere ( e.g. , ) , which can consume atmospheric oxygen .",
    "it has been estimated that volcanic eruption rates on venus has to be a few times higher than the current volcanic eruption rate of earth to consume the left - over in 100 million years ( fegley 2008 ) . for a super earth to prevent the build up due to hydrogen loss , the level of volcanic activity would need to be at least comparable to earth s , depending on how fast the hydrogen loss is .",

    "for example , in an oxygen - rich atmosphere , emitted hydrogen would react with free oxygen to form water , a process that yields chemical energy . for another example , in an evolved carbon - rich atmosphere , emitted hydrogen would react with unsaturated hydrocarbons to form more saturated forms of carbon , a process that also yields chemical energy . as shown in figure [ water_t ] and figure [ hydrocarbon_t ] ,",
    "the scarcity of hydrogen , driven by atmospheric loss , is the controlling factor for the major components in water - rich atmospheres and hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres .",
    "therefore , hydrogen escape to the space could potentially results in a large chemical gradient between the atmosphere and the interior of the planet .",

    "one might also speculate that for suitable temperatures the photochemically produced hydrocarbons may condense and form haze layers in the atmosphere .",
    "in fact , such process has been proposed to occur on some hot jupiters ( zahnle et al .",
    "2009a ) and as one of the explanations for the flat transmission spectrum of gj  1214  b ( morley et al .",
    "however , it is highly complex to model the hydrocarbon chemistry and potential haze formation in planetary atmospheres , because most of the chemical kinetic rates remain unknown .",
    "we have developed and validated a one - dimensional photochemistry - thermochemistry kinetic - transport model for the exploration of compositions of thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes .",
    "the unique feature of our photochemistry - thermochemistry model is that our model can treat both -dominated atmospheres and non -- dominated atmospheres , and our model is able to compute the main components and the mean molecular mass of an atmosphere based on its elemental abundance .",
    "this feature makes our model uniquely suitable for the exploration of super earth atmospheres , which are expected to have diverse chemical compositions .    using the photochemistry - thermochemistry model ,",
    "we have outlined a roadmap to characterize thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes . using the hydrogen abundance ( @xmath40 ) and the carbon to oxygen abundance ratio ( @xmath41 ) as the primary parameters ,",
    "we classify thick atmospheres on super earths and mini neptunes into hydrogen - rich atmospheres , water - rich atmospheres , oxygen - rich atmospheres , and hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres .",
    "we find that when @xmath66 , the atmosphere has free hydrogen and chemically behaves like -dominated atmospheres on gas giants . when @xmath141 , the atmosphere is water - rich for small @xmath41 and hydrocarbon - rich for large @xmath41 . in the middle of these regimes",

    "we find that in a -depleted water - dominated atmosphere , most of the trace mixture of carbon has to be in the form of rather than or .",
    "therefore a detection of water vapor features together with a confirmation of nonexistence of methane features are sufficient evidence for a water - dominated atmosphere on an exoplanet having similar temperatures as gj  1214  b. if a water - rich atmosphere continues to lose hydrogen , free oxygen may be left over in the atmosphere to form oxygen - rich atmospheres .    for hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres , we find that it is the scarcity of hydrogen , which can be a result of preferred loss of light elements or the details of atmospheric outgassing as the planet formed and cooled , that drives the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon . and can be the dominant forms of carbon in some cases , and they are the hallmark molecules for carbon - rich atmospheres on super earths . therefore they should be considered among `` standard '' building blocks for atmospheres on super earths . also for hydrocarbon - rich atmospheres",
