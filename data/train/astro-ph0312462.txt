    "the first strong evidence for the existence of a kinematically hot and metal - poor stellar population in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has recently been obtained at the european southern obervatory s _ very large telescope _",
    "( minniti et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the radial velocities derived from the spectra of 43 rr lyrae stars imply a velocity dispersion of 53  @xmath8  10  km  s@xmath9 , which is larger than that of any other population in the lmc ( e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "1991 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the radial velocities of carbon stars , which represent the bulk population of the lmc disk , have a dispersion of @xmath10  km  s@xmath9 ( van der marel et al .",
    "simple equilibrium models of the carbon - star radial velocities suggest that the lmc disk is thick like the galactic thick disk and flared .",
    "therefore , the lmc is a disk galaxy that has a halo , but not a bulge , and in this regard it is like m33 ( van den bergh 1991 ) .",
    "it is not known how stellar halos form , or how they relate to the other spheroidal components of galaxies ( e.g. , wyse & gilmore 1988 ) .",
    "stellar halos are minor constituents of disk galaxies , and thus they can be difficult to detect .",
    "the proximity of the lmc therefore affords a unique opportunity to study an extragalactic stellar halo .",
    "how does the lmc s stellar halo compare to the milky way s stellar halo ?",
    "this question illustrates the point that the lmc is a benchmark for understanding galaxy formation and structure , and hence also why measuring the basic parameters of the lmc s stellar halo is important .",
    "an accurate model of the lmc s stellar halo also provides a basis for interpreting microlensing results .",
    "in fact the stellar halo is a new population unknown in detail to any prior discussion of lmc microlensing , although its possible existence has been considered ( e.g. , alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "measurements of the surface density of rr lyrae stars in the lmc have a venerable history of being used to study the lmc s stellar halo ( kinman et al .",
    "rr lyrae stars are also used to map the structure of the galactic stellar halo ( e.g. , wetterer & mcgraw 1996 ) , and thus their distribution in the lmc can be compared directly to these galactic data .",
    "the starting point for the present work is fig .",
    "12 of alcock et al .",
    "( 2000b ) where the radial profile of rr lyrae star counts in the lmc based on data from 16 macho survey fields was presented .",
    "there are several reasons why that analysis should be revisited .",
    "first , the primary conclusion of alcock et al .",
    "( 2000b ) regarding the star - count data was the good fit of an exponential disk model ; halo models were not thoroughly compared .",
    "in addition , new and more accurate catalogs of rr lyrae stars in 30 macho survey fields have since been compiled ( inclusive of the 16 noted above ) , and artificial star tests have now also yielded statistical completeness corrections .",
    "last , a new catalog of rr lyrae stars from the ogle  ii survey is available ( soszyski et al .",
    "2003 ) , and these data can be analyzed together with the macho  data .",
    "the results of this analysis are used to estimate the total mass and mass - to - light ratio of the lmc , and to make predictions about lmc microlensing .",
    "one way to describe the lmc stellar halo is with king s ( 1962 ) model for an isothermal system of particles modified by an external tidal field .",
    "the approximate formula for fits to surface brightness data is : @xmath11 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the projected radius , and the parameters are the central normalization ( @xmath13 ) , the core radius ( @xmath14 ) , and the tidal radius ( @xmath15 ) . for @xmath16 , eqn .",
    "( 1 ) simplifies to the `` hubble - reynolds '' profile .",
    "a good approximation for the density profile of a king model is the `` modified hubble '' function : @xmath17^{-3/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the spherical radial coordinate .",
    "the projection of the modified hubble function is exactly the hubble - reynolds profile , and thus @xmath19 for @xmath16 .",
    "the central density ( @xmath20 ) in mass units is related to the velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) by @xmath22 ( rood et al .  1972 ) .    the catalog of rr lyrae stars used by alcock et al .",
    "( 2000b ) is known to have serious systematic errors in the number of stars in some fields ( e.g. , alcock et al .",
    "the most accurate catalog of rr lyrae stars in the macho database has not yet been published , but was provided by k.  cook ( private communication ) for the present investigation .",
    "cook s summary refers only to stars that pulsate in the fundamental mode ( type rr0 or rrab ) .",
    "these are the easiest to detect due to their large pulsation amplitudes , and they are traditionally used to study the stellar halos .",
    "the completeness of the macho database is now also better understood because of artificial star tests that were part of the microlensing detection efficiency calculation ( alcock et al .",
    "unpublished plots of the fraction of artificial stars recovered in the macho database as a function of input magnitude were constructed by t.  vandehei ( private communication ) for 6 example `` chunks '' of macho image data .",
    "the completeness fraction of interest has been read off of vandehei s diagram at @xmath23 = 19.4 mag , which represents a typical lmc rr lyrae star .",
    "as expected , the fraction of recovered @xmath23=19.4 stars ( @xmath24 ) is correlated with the density of detected objects in each example sub - field ( alcock et al .",
    "the result of a linear fit is @xmath24 = 1.37@xmath25n / n@xmath26 = @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is detected objects per arcmin@xmath29 ( alcock et al .",
    "2001 , see their table 2 ) , n is the number of rr0 stars , and n@xmath26 is the estimated total number of all types of rr lyrae stars .",
    "this approximate correction has an uncertainty of 7% based on the standard deviation of the fit to the artificial data .    a new catalog of lmc rr lyrae stars has also recently been published by the ogle  ii survey ( soszyski et al .  2003 ) .",
    "this catalog includes rr lyrae stars in all pulsation modes , not just the rr0 stars .",
    "soszyski et al .  (",
    "2003 ) suggest that the completeness of their catalog is 95% , but this is not consistent with the calibration obtained below as a free parameter in the profile fit . in order to incorporate these data , the type rr0 stars from ogle  ii fields",
    "39 are binned into 55 equal - area ( 96.8 arcmin@xmath29 ) regions that blanket the central bar .",
    "i adopt a ratio of 1.37 for the total number of rr lyrae stars to the number of rr0 stars in stellar halos from kinman et al .",
    "this factor is included in the completeness correction formula above .",
    "note , however , that the soszyski et al .  ( 2003 ) catalog implies a ratio of 1.30 for the lmc .",
    "the estimate by kinman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is preferred because it is based on galactic data , which may be more accurate .",
    "in particular , the lowest - amplitude rr lyrae stars are mostly not of type rr0 , and thus it is possible that relatively fewer of these have been detected in the lmc , which would tend to lower the lmc ratio . in any case , the main conclusions of this work are not significantly affected by this assumption .",
    "the king - model fits are performed on the macho and ogle  ii surface brightness data ( @xmath30 mag / arcsec@xmath29 ) presented in fig .",
    "it is assumed that every rr lyrae star represents a luminosity of 6730 @xmath31 in halo stars ( kinman et al .",
    "i adopt a standard distance modulus of 18.5 mag ( 50.1 kpc ) , and a tidal radius of @xmath15 = 15 kpc ( van der marel et al .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath15 does not significantly affect the derived parameters ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "in all there are 85 nearly independent measurements and 5 parameters to fit .",
    "the free parameters are the center of the halo , @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( j2000 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath32 from eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , and the fractional incompleteness of the ogle  ii data",
    ". inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that the majority of macho and ogle  ii data points are on different lines - of - sight , and are thus independent .",
    "the analysis is simplified by assuming that all of the points are independent . an additional 7% error associated with the completeness corrections",
    "is added in quadrature with the @xmath33 errors , and these are the error bars shown in the main panel of fig .  1",
    ". the best fit has @xmath34/dof = 1.19  ( dof=79 ) and parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 kpc , and @xmath38 mag / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "this model is the solid line .",
    "the @xmath34/dof obtained lends strong support to the accuracy of the derived and adopted parameters .",
    "note that the definition @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "1 is not the same as the maximum central surface brightness of the halo , which reaches only 23.35 mag / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "the `` incompleteness parameter '' used in the fit is a way to scale the ogle  ii data to best match the profile of the completeness - corrected macho data , and on this basis the ogle  ii data employed are only about 80% complete .",
    "finally , inspection of a map of the fit residuals ( not shown ) reveals no indication of ellipticity . a main result of this calculation is the estimate of the core radius .",
    "the center of the distribution of rr lyrae stars agrees well with the infrared and optical centers of the lmc bar : @xmath0 = @xmath39 , @xmath2 = @xmath40 ( van der marel 2001 ) , and @xmath0 = @xmath41 , @xmath2 = @xmath42 ( de  vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ) , respectively . for comparison , soszyski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report @xmath0  =  @xmath43 , @xmath2 = @xmath44 for the center of the rr lyrae distribution in the ogle  ii catalog .",
    "overall , these estimates suggest that the lmc center is known to an accuracy of about 10@xmath45 .",
    "note that the rr lyrae center is grossly inconsistent the kinematic center of the gas , but it is consistent with the kinematic center of the carbon stars ( van der marel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "before microlensing surveys existed , surface density measurements of lmc rr lyrae stars were made by blinking photographic plate images .",
    "these data , although obtained by primitive methods , provide a direct test of the accuracy of the halo model derived above .",
    "in addition , the fields surveyed with photographic plates are located farther from the center of the lmc than the now available microlensing survey data , and thus they should be useful to constrain the tidal radius , and to test if the halo is spherical at these radii",
    ". of course the situation might not be so simple .",
    "for example , the possible existence of extra - tidal stars near the lmc s periphery could complicate the interpretation of the tidal radius .",
    "the photographic rr0 star - count data summarized by kinman et al .  ( 1991 ) are reproduced in table  1 , which lists the field name ( associated with a globular cluster in each field ) , the radial distance from lmc center , the area surveyed , and the observed number of rr0 stars .",
    "the numbers of rr0 stars expected according to the spherical halo model are listed for easy comparison .",
    "these data are also compared in the inset panel of fig .  1 .",
    "significant discrepancies are obvious .",
    "the worst case is the ngc1783 field where the observed number of rr0 stars is probably only about 50% complete .",
    "however , the agreement is fair in the two outermost fields ( reticulum & ngc1841 ) . inspection of the images of these fields underlines the fact that they are very empty , and thus confusion is not an issue , and that the rr0 stars are detected with reasonably high signal - to - noise .",
    "therefore , the photographic data should be interpreted with caution , but perhaps not dismissed entirely . finally , however , an attempt to fit eqn .",
    "( 1 ) to these photographic data yields no better constraint on the tidal radius than the current best kinematic estimate of @xmath46 kpc ( van der marel et al .",
    "the new model of the lmc stellar halo yields information about the total mass of the lmc complementary to what is already known from the rotation curve .",
    "the most accurate estimate of the maximum circular velocity of the lmc disk is based on carbon stars ( van der marel et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath47 km s@xmath9 at the last measured radius of 8.9 kpc . extrapolating out to the tidal radius implies a total mass of @xmath48 .",
    "the estimated total @xmath23-band luminosity of the lmc is @xmath49 in solar units , and hence the global mass - to - light ratio is @xmath50 ( van der marel et al .  2002 ; see also alves & nelson 2000 ) .",
    "if the stars in the core of the lmc s stellar halo have a maxwellian velocity distribution , then the expected velocity dispersion is @xmath51 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this is in good agreement with @xmath52 km  s@xmath9 measured by minniti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . adopting the measured estimates of @xmath21 and @xmath14 ,",
    "king s core - fitting method yields a central mass density @xmath53 kpc@xmath54 .",
    "the assumptions of king s method are that mass follows light , that the orbits of the rr lyrae stars are isotropic , and that the lmc is in equilibrium .",
    "the central surface brightness of the lmc is 20.56 mag / arcsec@xmath29 ( bothun & thompson 1988 ) , which therefore implies @xmath5 for @xmath19 . for the total @xmath23-band luminosity given above ,",
    "the predicted total mass of the lmc is @xmath55 .",
    "the error bars on the estimated mass - to - light ratio and total mass are dominated by the uncertainty of @xmath21 .",
    "instead of a spherical halo model , an exponential disk model fit to the data in  2 yields a radial scale length of @xmath56 kpc , a maximum central surface brightness of @xmath57  mag / arcsec@xmath29 , and @xmath34/dof = 1.19  ( dof=82 ) .",
    "this model is the dotted line in fig .  1 , and it is statistically indistinguishable from the best - fit halo model .",
    "( the center and incompleteness of the ogle  ii data are fixed to the values found above , but the results are the same if this assumption is relaxed . )",
    "an exponential is known to usually provide a good fit to the core of an isothermal , as found here .    although the lmc s halo and disk are kinematically different , the shape of the surface density profile of the rr lyrae stars is remarkably similar to that of the young disk .",
    "for example , the best - fit exponential scale length for the rr lyrae stars is very close to the scale length of the lmc s blue light : 1.46  kpc ( bothun & thompson 1988 ) . for comparison , the milky way s stellar halo as traced by rr lyrae stars does not look like an exponential disk ; it has a power - law density profile @xmath58 ( wetterer & mcgraw 1996 ) from 0.6 to 80 kpc , which projects to a surface density profile that is obviously different from exponential models that best represent the milky way s disk .",
    "the basic parameters of the lmc s stellar halo were unknown to any prior discussion of lmc microlensing ( e.g. , salati et al .  1999 ; gyuk et al .",
    "the following approximate calculation is the first to use a modified hubble density model .",
    "the optical depth for a thin inclined disk embedded in a distribution of lenses is given by ( gould 1993 ; guidice , mollerach & roulet 1994 ) : @xmath59^{3/2 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the spherical radial coordinate , @xmath60 is the density of lenses , @xmath61 is the distance between the observer and source stars , @xmath62 is the line of sight , and the density @xmath63 is from eqn .",
    "the approximation is to drop the term @xmath64 because the lmc s tidal radius is a factor of a few smaller than the lmc s distance .",
    "the constants in the denominator are : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is position angle relative to the far minor axis of the disk , the impact parameter is @xmath68 , and the disk has an inclination angle @xmath69 .",
    "the integration limit is @xmath70 .",
    "dwight ( 1961 ) solves the integral ( see eqn .",
    "380.013 ) , and thus : @xmath71\\ ] ] the first term in eqn .",
    "( 4 ) is an odd power of @xmath72 , which yields the highest values on the far side of the inclined disk .",
    "the lmc disk is generally known to contain interstellar dust , and this opacity will tend to suppress the rate of disk - on - halo lensing relative to halo - on - disk lensing . therefore , the existence of the lmc stellar halo implies a new local maximum in the lmc optical depth map whose location depends in part on the parameters of the halo as given by eqn .",
    "a ratio of @xmath73 = 1.6 is typical of stellar halos ( kinman et al .",
    "1991 ) , and this implies @xmath74 kpc@xmath54 for the lmc stellar halo following  2 . adopting a disk inclination of 34.7@xmath75 and a line - of - nodes at position angle @xmath76130@xmath75 measured east of north ( van der marel et al .",
    "2002 ) , eqn .",
    "( 4 ) predicts a maximum of @xmath77 at a distance of 0.95 degrees from center at position angle @xmath76220@xmath75 .",
    "this is nearest to microlensing events 4 , 5 , 22 , and 23 from alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ; their table  8) . excluding event 5 , which is caused by a lens in the galaxy , and event 22 , which is a peculiar supernova , events 4 and 23 account for an optical depth of @xmath78 . therefore , based on location and approximate contribution to the observed optical depth , it is possible that macho events lmc-4 and lmc-23 are halo - on - disk stellar self - lensing .",
    "the remaining events in the macho sample ( excluding 5 , 22 , and the self - lensing event lmc-14 ; alcock et al .",
    "2001b ) account for an optical depth of @xmath79 , which is not explained by stellar lenses in the lmc or galaxy .",
    "a king model fit to rr lyrae star - count data in the lmc yields the center of their distribution at @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 = @xmath3 ( j2000 ) and a core radius of @xmath4 kpc . as a check ,",
    "the predicted numbers of halo rr lyrae stars near the lmc periphery are compared with counts based on photographic plates . however , these data require a cautious interpretation .",
    "king s core - fitting method implies a mass - to - light ratio @xmath5 and total lmc mass @xmath6 .",
    "it is noted that the shape of the surface density profile of the lmc s halo is very similar to that of its young disk , which is not the case for the galactic disk and halo system .",
    "finally , the stellar halo is predicted to cause a local maximum of microlensing optical depth large enough to possibly explain macho events lmc-4 and lmc-23 , but not all of the observed events",
    ". further observations of rr lyrae stars that might test the spherical lmc halo model include more surface - density data near the tidal radius , more kinematic data , and accurate distances on multiple lines of sight .",
