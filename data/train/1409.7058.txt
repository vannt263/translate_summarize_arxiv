    "the lack of super - partner signals from new physics searches at lhc8 @xcite ( the lhc with @xmath10  tev ) , together with the measured value of the mass of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson @xcite , has led many authors to question whether weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) as realized by the minimal supersymmetric standard model is natural : _",
    "i.e. _ whether the weak scale exemplified by the values of @xmath11 or @xmath12 can be obtained without large fine - tuning of model parameters",
    ". the relative insensitivity of weak scale physics to physics at very high scales ( such as _ e.g. _ the unification scale @xmath13 in susy grand unified theories ) was for many years ( and remains ) one of the driving motivations for weak scale susy .",
    "we stress that weak scale susy theories do not suffer from the huge fine - tuning problem of the standard model ( sm ) : while fine - tuning in the sm is a part in @xmath14 , fine - tuning in weak scale susy theories , by any of several measures discussed in the literature , is typically no more than a part in @xmath15 , and often significantly smaller  @xcite .",
    "the well - known relation @xcite , = -^2 [ eq : mz ] obtained from the minimization of the ( renormalization group improved ) one - loop electroweak scalar potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) enables us to define @xmath16 , which measures the degree of cancellation between various contributions ( defined at the weak scale ) to obtain the measured value of @xmath17 . in ( [ eq : mz ] ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are radiative corrections which depend strongly on the value of third generation squark masses .",
    "expressions for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given in the appendix of ref .",
    "the electroweak fine - tuning parameter @xmath16 is defined by @xcite , max_i |c_i|/(m_z^2/2 ) , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "also , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 labels the various loop contributions included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz ] ) . requiring weak scale fine - tuning smaller than @xmath26",
    "then implies that , ||^2 < , [ eq : bound ] implying that higgsinos can not be very heavy  @xcite .",
    "term that then also enters the scalar higgs potential .",
    "this is the case in all models we know of . ]",
    "we emphasize that the existence of light higgsinos , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is a very robust feature of susy models with low fine - tuning .",
    "even with other measures of fine - tuning in the literature  such as @xmath29 which includes the effects of large logarithms from renormalization that occur in models defined at a high scale @xcite or the traditional measure @xmath30 @xcite which most readily incorporates correlations between weak scale parameters  light higgsinos are a must .",
    "this is often hidden because proponents of these measures often emphasize the contribution of top squark masses to fine - tuning , and the role of higgsinos is obscured .",
    "it has been noted , however , that correlations among model parameters ( such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _ etc . _ ) can lead to low @xmath16 along with @xmath33 @xcite even for tev scale top - squarks well beyond the lhc reach : see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath4-parameter occurs directly in ( [ eq : mz ] ) and renormalizes relatively little between the high scale and the weak scale , models with large @xmath34 are necessarily fine - tuned in any theory where the super - potential parameters and the soft - susy breaking parameters have independent origins .",
    "for this reason , we view light higgsinos as an essential feature of susy models with low fine - tuning  @xcite .    in most high scale models where parameters are defined at a scale @xmath35 , the higgs soft mass is typically driven via renormalization group evolution to large ( tev - scale ) negative values at the weak scale .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is adjusted ( tuned ) to gain the measured value of @xmath11 via the electroweak symmetry breaking constraint ( [ eq : mz ] ) . as a result , in most models with relatively heavy sparticles @xmath16",
    "is typically large  @xcite . to obtain a low values of @xmath16 ,",
    "however , we need @xmath36 to be driven through zero to a value close to @xmath37 at the weak scale . then , for moderate to large values of @xmath38 , we see from ( [ eq : mz ] ) that @xmath39 will also be close to @xmath17 .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been suggested to ensure this .",
    "perhaps the best known example occurs in the hyperbolic branch / focus point ( hb / fp ) region @xcite within msugra or its extension to include non - universal third generation matter scalar masses and @xmath40-parameters @xcite .",
    "non - universality of soft - susy - breaking parameters in the higgs sector also allows for low values of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "for instance , allowing independent choices for gut scale higgs mass squared parameters guarantees that one can adjust the high scale value of @xmath36 so that it runs down to a value not far from @xmath37 at the weak scale .",
    "indeed , this is the idea underlying the radiatively - driven natural susy ( rns ) framework ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) that we adopt for our analysis .",
    "low values of @xmath39 can also be obtained by allowing non - universality in the gaugino sector .",
    "models with high values of the gut scale wino mass parameter  @xcite or low values of the gluino mass parameter  @xcite that lead to relatively low values of @xmath34 have been suggested in the context of well - tempered wimps . in a recent study  @xcite ,",
    "martin has suggested a model where the susy breaking @xmath41-term also breaks the gut symmetry via a field that is a linear combination of a * 1 * and * 24 * dimensional representation of @xmath42 leading to a non - universal pattern of gut scale gaugino mass parameters  @xcite that results in a relatively small magnitude of @xmath4 .    at this point",
    "one may well wonder how the little hierarchy between the magnitude of @xmath4 ( required to obtain low values of @xmath16 ) and the sparticle mass scale ( typified by the gravitino mass @xmath43 in gravity - mediation ) arises in the first place : @xmath44 .",
    "the answer lies in the proposed solutions to the well - known @xmath4-problem : why is the magnitude of the supersymmetric @xmath4 term so much smaller than the planck scale ?",
    "these solutions all involve first forbidding the appearance of @xmath4 via some unspecified ( perhaps peccei - quinn ) symmetry , and then generating it via superpotential couplings to additional visible sector fields ( as in the nmssm @xcite ) or via non - renormalizable interactions with hidden sector fields in either the khler potential ( giudice - masiero or gm ) @xcite or the superpotential ( kim - nilles or kn ) @xcite . in gm , then one expects in gravity mediation that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimensionless coupling constant , while in kn then one expects @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking scale . in the former case ,",
    "the little hierarchy @xmath44 could result from small @xmath49 , while in the latter case it might be a reflection of a mis - match between pq and hidden sector mass scales @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "light higgsinos can be definitively searched for at electron - positron colliders provided that @xmath51 .",
    "it has been shown that at the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ) with 80% polarized electron beams  in addition to discovery ",
    "detailed measurements that unequivocally point to the higgsino origin of the signal should be possible  @xcite even in the very challenging case where the visible energy release in higgsino decay is as small as 10  gev .",
    "( corresponding to no worse than 3% electroweak fine - tuning ) , the mass gap between the next - to - lightest neutralino and the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is always larger than 10  gev .",
    "even smaller mass gaps below the gev level can also be explored at ilc via a very different technique @xcite . ]",
    "an ilc operating at @xmath52  gev should be able either to discover light higgsinos or decisively exclude the idea of natural susy with better than 3% ew fine - tuning , if gaugino mass unification is assumed .    in view of the importance of naturalness , it is critical to examine prospects for light higgsino discovery at the lhc where the light higgsino states @xmath28 and @xmath27 can be pair produced by quark anti - quark collisions via the processes , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the produced charginos and neutralinos then decay via @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are sm quarks and leptons , potentially resulting in various multi - jet plus multi - lepton signatures , including the much celebrated clean trilepton signature for susy .",
    "the problem , of course , is that in natural susy where @xmath61 the higgsinos states all have a mass close to @xmath34 , because the mass gaps @xmath62 and @xmath63 are proportional to @xmath64 and typically about 10 - 20  gev . as a result , the visible daughter jets and leptons from charginos and neutralino decays are very soft , and likely buried under sm backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a trigger for these soft events is an additional complication .",
    "this led various groups to consider lhc prospects for discovering light higgsinos produced in association with a hard qcd jet @xcite , a photon  @xcite , @xmath65 or @xmath66 boson  @xcite or even a higgs boson  @xcite , where the associated particle could serve as a trigger for the event , resulting in characteristic mono - something events with nothing other than the very soft debris from @xmath67 or @xmath68 decays .",
    "we are pessimistic about prospects for lhc discovery of higgsino pairs via detection of monojets or mono - photons .",
    "the problem is that although a statistically significant signal might be possible , the signal to background ratio is @xmath69% , _ without any discernable difference in the shapes of any distributions that characterize the jet or the photon _ @xcite .",
    "we find it difficult to imagine that the absolute rates for tails of qcd backgrounds will be known to better than a percent precision required to unequivocally discover the signal .",
    "it had been suggested  @xcite that lhc detection prospects of nearly mass degenerate higgsinos may be improved by requiring additional soft leptons in events . in a recent paper , han , kribs , martin and menon  @xcite",
    "have studied this possibility in the two - lepton plus jet channel .",
    "motivated by the importance of the issue of naturalness , we felt that an independent examination of this topic was warranted . while we broadly agree with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite ( that the higgsino signal may indeed be observable at lhc14 with 300 - 1000  fb@xmath0 ) , our analysis differs from that of han _",
    "_ in several important respects detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] .",
    "in addition , we show that the signal may also be detectable via the measurement of the rate asymmetry in monojet events with same flavour dileptons and monojet events with opposite flavour dileptons . unlike the signal from a cut - and - count experiment",
    ", the flavour asymmetry measurement does not suffer from the systematic uncertainty associated with the normalization of the background .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly outline the rns framework that we use for our analysis , and set up the model line that we use for our study .",

    "[ sec : calc ] where we also compare and contrast our calculations with those of han _",

    "[ sec : reach ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] with a summary of our results and our outlook for discovering natural susy at the lhc .",
    "the rns framework provides a setting for generating mssm spectra with @xmath16 in the 10 - 30 range .",
    "specifically , we generate these in the framework of the nuhm2 model  @xcite specified by the parameter set , m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  ,  m_a consisting of the familiar msugra / cmssm parameters specified at the gut scale , augmented by the weak scale parameters @xmath4 and @xmath70 .",
    "the ability to specify @xmath4 and @xmath70 independently of other parameters arises from the freedom to choose the gut scale values of the scalar higgs soft - susy breaking parameters independently of the @xmath71 , which is why the model is referred to as the non - universal higgs mass model with two additional parameters .",
    "if we choose @xmath72 then radiative corrections in ( [ eq : mz ] ) from top squark loop contributions @xmath73 are suppressed even for @xmath74  tev and @xmath75 .",
    "the large magnitude of @xmath76 at the same time lifts @xmath12 to its measured value because the top - squarks are highly mixed .",
    "then , if we adopt @xmath77  gev , we find @xmath16 in the 10 - 30 range as desired  @xcite .",
    "the rns spectrum is characterized by @xcite ,    light higgsino states @xmath28 and @xmath27 in the 100 - 300  gev range ( the lighter the better ) with a mass gap between the heavier higgsinos and @xmath78 of about @xmath79  gev ,    well - mixed third generation squarks with tev scale masses ,    @xmath80  tev so that gluino loop corrections do not uplift the top squark masses .",
    "first / second generation sfermion masses can be chosen to be in the 5 - 30  tev range without jeopardizing naturalness provided one of several degeneracy patterns within first / second generation sfermion multiplets is respected  @xcite . although not required by naturalness , we adopt this choice because it ameliorates the susy flavour problem by decoupling the new physics @xcite , and also addresses the proton decay @xcite and gravitino @xcite problems ( in models where gravitinos get a mass comparable to that of these scalars ) .    within the rns framework , the mass gaps between @xmath81 and the higgsino - like lsp @xmath78 decrease with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath63 consistent with @xmath83 is about 10  gev  @xcite .",
    "since lhc signals for higgsino detection become most challenging for small values of the mass gap , we adopt a nuhm2 model line ( where we vary that parameter @xmath4 which fixes the mass scale for the higgsino - like states ) m_0=5  tev ,  m_1/2=1  tev ,  = 15 ,  a_0=-1.6m_0 ,   m_a=1  tev , [ eq : mline ] which yields @xmath63 close to 10  gev for our initial analysis .",
    "( for completeness , we note that the lighter chargino mass tracks the @xmath68 mass and that @xmath84  gev for 100  gev @xmath85  250  gev which , as we will see below , covers the higgsino mass range accessible at even the high luminosity lhc . ) for the calculation of sparticle mass spectra and sparticle decay patterns we use the isajet 7.84 program  @xcite where we fix @xmath86  gev .",

    "in contrast , the cross section for @xmath100 production ( and also for @xmath101 production , not shown because it gives monojet events without any additional leptons ) is strongly suppressed .",

    "experiments should be sensitive to higgsinos at the @xmath255 level if @xmath292  gev , while the high luminosity upgrades should be sensitive to @xmath4 values as high as 210  gev : see fig .",
    "[ fig : cutreach ] . , our projections for the reach are sensitive to our assumptions about how well we can veto @xmath125-jets . here",
    ", we have conservatively assumed a tagging efficiency of just 60% for @xmath125-jets in the fiducial region , for the upcoming lhc run , as well as for the high luminosity upgrade of the lhc . ] it should be emphasized that the sensitivity in this figure is evaluated using just the expected statistical error in the background which is assumed to be measured or calculated , and does not include any error from the uncertainty of the background .",
    "inclusion of this systematic uncertainty will reduce the signal significance , and hence the reach .",
    "this could be relevant especially at the high - luminosity upgrade where the signal to background ratio for @xmath293  gev is just 5% .",
    "in addition to projecting the lhc14 reach of higgsinos from a traditional cut - and - count experiment , we have also evaluated the lhc reach obtained via the measurement of the flavour asymmetry variable introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym ] ) .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : asymreach ] that the lhc reach for @xmath4 via this measurement is just 10 - 15  gev smaller than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutreach ] .",
    "this procedure , however , has the important advantage that this reach is insensitive to systematic uncertainties from the background normalization .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : asymreach ] that , in contrast to the reach from the counting experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutreach ] , the reach via the flavour asymmetry measurement increases with increasing neutralino mass gap .",
    "we can not overstress the importance of the direct search for higgsinos as these could well be the only accessible superpartners at lhc14 .",
    "gluinos and first generation squarks may be in the multi - tev range without jeopardizing naturalness .",
    "top squarks may also be in the 1 - 2  tev range , well beyond the lhc reach .",
    "signals from wino production that could lead to characteristic same - sign dilepton events without hard jet activity  @xcite may well be accessible at the high luminosity upgrade of the lhc even if gluinos are inaccessible .",
    "but again , the accessibility of winos at even the high luminosity lhc is not guaranteed by naturalness considerations .    in summary",
    ", lhc14 will be sensitive to light higgsinos of natural susy models via the search for monojet events with identified os / sf dileptons , mostly from the decays @xmath281 .",
    "these dileptons necessarily have low invariant masses , @xmath294 .",
    "even with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath0 expected from a year of lhc operation at the design luminosity , the sensitivity of lhc14 experiments to higgsinos should reach beyond what was explored at lep200 , and up to about what may be observable at ilc250 @xcite .",
    "the lhc reach grows with integrated luminosity , but even with @xmath69 ab@xmath0 of integrated luminosity , the reach in @xmath4 extends to just over 200  gev . while the lhc can indeed probe models of susy with the smallest fine - tuning , it appears that an electron - positron linear collider with @xmath295  gev is essential for a complete exploration of natural susy models with less than 3% electroweak fine - tuning .",
    "it is , nonetheless , exciting that lhc14 could be a discovery machine for higgsinos of natural susy .",
