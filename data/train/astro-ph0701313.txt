    "the determination of @xmath0 is important for at least the following reasons : a ) it is one of the pillars of big bang cosmology and an accurate determination of @xmath0 permits to test the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , b ) the models of stellar evolution require an accurate initial @xmath2 value ; this is given by @xmath0 plus the additional @xmath2 produced by galactic chemical evolution , which can be estimated based on the @xmath1 ratio , c ) the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is needed to test models of galactic chemical evolution , d ) to test solar models it is necessary to know the initial solar abundances , which are different to the photospheric ones due to diffusive settling , this effect reduces the helium and heavy element abundances in the solar photosphere relative to that of hydrogen , the initial solar abundances can be provided by models of galactic chemical evolution , e ) the determination of the @xmath2 value in metal poor h  ii regions requires a deep knowledge of their physical conditions , in particular the @xmath2 determination depends to a significant degree on their density and temperature distribution , therefore accurate @xmath2 determinations combined with the assumption of sbbn provide a constraint on the density and temperature structure of h  ii regions .",
    "previous reviews on @xmath0 determinations have been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent determinations of @xmath0 are those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a critical discussion of these determinations has been presented by @xcite .",
    "most of the differences among these determinations are due to systematic effects .",
    "the error budget of the @xmath0 determination by @xcite is presented in table  1 . in this table",
    "the sources of error are listed in order of importance .",
    "the error budgets of @xmath0 determinations by other groups are different to that by @xcite for many reasons , each error budget depends on the sample of h  ii regions used and on the treatment given to the different sources of error .",

    "the most important source of error is the collisional excitation of balmer lines .",
    "neutral hydrogen atoms in excited states may form not only by the usual process of h@xmath6 recombination , but also through collisions of neutral hydrogen with electrons . the recombination cascade that follows such excitations contributes to the observed intensity of balmer lines , mimicking a larger relative hydrogen abundance and , hence , a smaller helium abundance . to estimate this contribution",
    "it is necessary to have a tailored photoionization model for each object that fits properly the temperature structure .",
    "the contribution to the balmer line intensities depends strongly on the temperature : therefore this effect , and consequently the associated error in its estimate , increases for h  ii regions of lower metallicity and consequently higher temperature .",
    "the second most important source of error is the temperature structure .",
    "most determinations neglect the possible presence of temperature variations across the h  ii region structure and assume that @xmath7(o  iii ) is representative of the zone where the he  i recombination lines form .",
    "however , other temperature determinations based on different diagnostics yield lower values ; furthermore , photoionization models do not predict the high @xmath7(o  iii ) values observed .",
    "these results indicate that temperature variations are indeed present in h  ii regions , and this result should be included in the @xmath2 determination @xcite .",
    "the best procedure to take into account the temperature structure is to self - consistently determine @xmath7(he  ii ) from a set of he  i lines by means of the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the @xmath2 abundances derived from @xmath7(he  ii ) are typically lower by about 0.0030 @xmath8 0.0050 than those derived from @xmath7(o  iii ) .",
    "the difference between both temperatures does not have a significant trend with the metallicity of the h  ii region , hence the systematic error introduced by the use of @xmath7(o  iii ) in the @xmath2 determination is similar for objects with different metallicities . the error quoted under `` temperature structure '' in table  1",
    "is the residual error due to the uncertainty in the @xmath7(he  ii ) determinations of the dataset by @xcite .",
    "the third most important source of error is the extrapolation of the derived @xmath2 values to zero metallicity through the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "this problem will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the fourth most important source of error is the uncertainty on the recombination coefficients of the he  i lines .",
    "to determine the @xmath0 value it is customary to use the @xmath2 values of a set of @xmath4 poor galaxies and to extrapolate the @xmath2 values to the case of @xmath9 using the following equation :    @xmath10    where @xmath4 is the oxygen abundance per unit mass . to obtain an accurate @xmath0 value ,",
    "a reliable determination of @xmath1 for @xmath4-poor objects is needed .",
    "the @xmath1 value derived by @xcite from observational results and models of chemical evolution of galaxies amounts to 3.5 @xmath3 0.9 .",
    "more recent results are those by @xcite who finds 2.93 @xmath3 0.85 from observations of 30 dor and ngc 346 , and by @xcite who , from the observations of 82 h  ii regions , find @xmath1 = 4.3 @xmath3 0.7 .",
    "we have recomputed the value by izotov et al . considering two systematic effects not considered by them : the fraction of oxygen trapped in dust grains , which we estimate to be 10% for objects of low metallicity , and the increase in the @xmath4 abundances due to explicit taking into account the presence of temperature fluctuations , which for this type of h  ii regions we estimate to be about 0.08 dex @xcite . from these considerations",
    "we obtain for the izotov et al . sample a @xmath11 .",
    "from chemical evolution models of galaxies it is found that @xmath12 depends on : the stellar yields , the initial mass function , the star formation rate , the age , and the @xmath4 value of the galaxy in question .",
    "models with substantial outflows of o - rich material can produce large @xmath1 ratios but they are ruled out by the low c / o values observed in irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite have produced chemical evolution models of the following types : closed box , inflow of gas , and outflow of gas of well - mixed material .",
    "they find that @xmath12 is practically constant for models with the same imf , the same age , the same star formation history , and an @xmath4 abundance smaller than @xmath13 4@xmath14 .",
    "they find also that @xmath15 for models with different star formation histories and different values of the upper mass limit of the imf .",
    "the results derived from the chemical evolution models are in very good agreement with the observations mentioned above .    based on the observations and models discussed , @xcite adopted a value of @xmath16 in the computation of the error budget presented in table  1 and the @xmath0 value presented in table  2 .    for models of galactic chemical evolution that reach values of @xmath17 at present time , the @xmath1 ratio of the interstellar medium increases with the @xmath4 abundance due to two effects : the helium production by low and intermediate mass stars and the increase of the helium yield of massive stars due to stellar winds .    as an example of the minor role that well mixed outflows play in the chemical evolution of galaxies in figure 1 we present the @xmath18 versus @xmath19 behavior for two chemical evolution models of ngc 6822 @xcite .",
    "these models have the same sfh , which was derived from observations , but are drastically different in their gas flow histories and show practically the same @xmath12 behavior .    to compute stellar evolution models with @xmath20 we propose to use the following relation for the initial @xmath2 and @xmath4 abundances @xmath21 for @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath2 increases faster with the increase of @xmath4 than in the previous equation .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath22 if the fraction of @xmath23 is known .",
    "based on observations of galactic and extragalactic h  ii regions , we propose to assume that , for models with @xmath20 , @xmath4 constitutes 55% @xmath24% of the total @xmath25 value , implying @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath17 the fraction of @xmath25 due to @xmath4 decreases due to the increase of the c / o , n / o and fe / o ratios with the increase of @xmath4 . from the chemical composition of the orion nebula and m17",
    "it is found that the fraction of @xmath25 due to @xmath4 drops to about 42% for @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "previous determinations of the @xmath28 ratio based on models or observations have been in the 1.0 to 6.0 range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that 25 years ago @xcite determined a value of @xmath29 , in excellent agreement with the recent results by @xcite .",
    "in table  2 we present some of the best @xmath0 determinations of the last few years . the @xmath0 values and",
    "their statistical errors are the ones presented in the original papers . after the statistical error we list the systematic error estimated by us , which depends on one or more of the following sources : a ) the change in the published emissivities of the he  i lines @xcite ; b ) the change in the published collisional excitation coefficients of the h  i lines @xcite ; and c ) the temperature structure of the h  ii region . adopting the new he  i emissivities ,",
    "the @xmath2 determination of individual h  ii regions is increased by about 0.004 .",
    "the change in the h  i collisional excitation coefficients goes in the same direction @xcite , although in this case the size of this effect varies from object to object and a tailored photoionization model for each object is needed to obtain a good estimate of it .",
    "both effects produce an increase in the @xmath0 determination : for the sample of h  ii regions used by @xcite , the increase in @xmath0 due to the adoption of the new he  i emissivities amounts to about 0.0040 , while the increase due to the adoption of the new h  i collisional excitation coefficients amounts to 0.0025 .",
    "finally , the @xmath2 value of individual h  ii regions decreases when the temperature structure of the h  ii region is taken into account , since in the self - consistent solutions for all the observed he  i line intensities , the lower @xmath7(he  ii ) values imply higher densities , the higher densities produce a higher collisional contribution to the he  i intensities , and consequently lower helium abundances . for the objects in the sample used by @xcite and @xcite , this effect decreases the @xmath2 determinations by amounts ranging from 0.003 to 0.009 .",
    "the @xmath0 determination by @xcite is affected by all three of the above sources of systematic error ; those by @xcite and @xcite are affected by sources a ) and b ) , while the one by @xcite is affected by source b ) .",
    "the disagreement between the @xmath0 derived by @xcite with the @xmath0 derived from wmap under the assumption of sbbn implies the need for `` new physics '' . the new physics needed to reconcile the two @xmath0 values turned out to be the `` new atomic physics '' by @xcite and @xcite . with the new physics @xcite found agreement , within the observational errors , between the observed @xmath0 value and that derived from the wmap results under the assumption of sbbn .",
    "the @xmath0 derived by @xcite together with sbbn implies that @xmath30 = @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the baryon closure parameter , and @xmath33 is the hubble parameter .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the value derived by @xcite from the wmap results under the assumption of sbbn , which amounts to @xmath30 = @xmath34 .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath0 derived by @xcite with the @xmath0 derived by @xcite from the wmap data together with the assumption of sbbn provides strong constraints for the study of non sbbn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in table  2 we also present our @xmath0 prediction for 2010 .",
    "we consider that in the next few years it will be possible to reduce the statistical errors in the @xmath0 determination to about 0.0020 by obtaining a new set of observations of brighter and slightly o - richer h  ii regions than the ones that have been used so far . a more extensive discussion of the relative advantages of these h  ii regions with respect to more metal - poor ones can be found in @xcite .",
