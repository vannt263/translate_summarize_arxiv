    "let us review the key results from @xcite .",

    ", it can be shown that @xmath221 and @xmath222 , which are in agreement with our conjecture for the cases @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively .",
    "the formal reason for anomalous scaling for @xmath192 is vanishing of the two - particle probability distribution function at @xmath225 .",
    "this is the most clear indication of anti - correlation between annihilating particles .",
    "this same phenomenon is responsible for zeros of multi - particle distribution functions as well . to explore the nature of these zeros starting from the exact recurrence relations of @xcite we were forced to use mathematica : exact expressions for correlation functions are written as linear combination of a variety of terms involving products of @xmath226 . at small separations",
    "these expressions simplify due to a number of cancellations which are not obvious . using mathematica to break through the tedious computations we find : @xmath227",
    "note that all distribution functions above vanish as the first power of separation between any pair of particles .",
    "hence we can make a conjecture about spatio - temporal behaviour of distribution functions for arbitrary @xmath5 : @xmath228 the above expression is a direct generalization of ( [ n234 ] ) based on permutation symmetry and self - similarity .",
    "it states that the spatial dependence of the probability density is given by the van - der - monde determinant of particles coordinates .",

    "moreover it turns out that all divergences of @xmath234 are also eliminated by reaction rate renormalization . for higher order composite operators one needs multiplicative renormalization .",
    "let @xmath235 be the bare ( dimensionless ) reaction rate , where @xmath111 is our arbitrary reference time .",

    "we obtained our results in a field - theoretic setting by identifying probability distributions of multi - particle configurations , at scales much smaller than correlation length , with composite operators in doi - zeldovich field theory .",
