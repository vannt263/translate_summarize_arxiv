    "[ fig : pot ] , three different types of two - dimensional substrates are overlaid with a rotated and detuned hexagonal lattice . in figure",
    "[ fig : pot](a ) , a hexagonal lattice is illustrated , leading to a superstructure with a six - fold symmetry of regions with better compatibility .",
    "the same symmetry occurs for a honeycomb lattice , displayed in figure  [ fig : pot](c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot](e ) is created by employing a quasicrystalline lattice consisting of squares and triangles . since a quasicrystal possesses at least two length scales per direction , the superstructure of compatibility regions is no longer periodic .",
    "for example , the square - triangle tiling that is used here ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) has two incommensurate length scales per direction .",
    "the compatibility regions are given by the length scale of the growing lattice and one length scale of the quasicrystalline substrate , while the second length scales causes a modulation of the compatibility regions such that the compatibility regions never repeat in exactly the same way .",
    "thus , the resulting pattern of a square - triangular and a hexagonal lattice shown in figure  [ fig : pot](e ) yields a six - fold symmetry but the repeating regions all differ slightly from each other . the growth of a nucleus with stripe symmetry on all three different substrate symmetries can be regarded and snapshots of this are shown in the corresponding figures  [ fig : pot](b , d , f ) .",
    "regions with density peaks above the threshold density are covered in black while white regions have density values below the threshold density . obviously , the black spots apart from the crystal correspond to compatible regions of the two lattice structures .",
    "as the growth process is similar in all presented cases , it can be extracted that for other kinds of substrate potentials , a crystal will grow in analogy to our prediction by a compatibility wave which drives the growth preferable at compatibility positions .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the dynamics of crystal growth for the case where a hexagonal nucleus of particles is placed on a patterned substrate .",
    "we found that due to the different length scales that occur in the direction of growth - one length scale given by the hexagonal crystal that is about to grow , and at least one other length scale by the substrate potential - no well - defined and connected crystal - fluid interface is obtained .",
    "in contrast , a compatibility wave drives the growth by favoring the regions of high compatibility of the two length scales . in principle",
    ", the same growth scenario also applies to the growth behaviour on more complex substrate potentials .",
    "the only relevant parameter that determines the position of the compatibility regions is the detune ratio of the two length scales .",
    "the compatibility wave concept is also relevant for molecular absorbate on atomic substrates .",
    "however , it is difficult to obersve directly for molecular systems .",
    "a possible application of the compatibility wave concept is that a crystal is grown and impurities are confined at positions predefined by the compatibility regions . as islands form before the crystal - fluid interface , impurities can be locally trapped instead of being pushed in front of the interface . as a second application",
    ", it can be possible to infer the structure and the properties of the initial nucleus from the occurrence of the compatibility regions and the positions of the islands .",
    "furthermore , the growth behaviour of a nucleus on a patterned substrate in a three - dimensional system may be strongly related to the presented 2d results .",
    "therefore , we believe that compatibility waves are important for a lot of systems where crystal growth processes on substrates with detuned length scales are studied and that the growth via a compatibility wave is a more suitable description than any scenario that requires a connected interface between the fluid and the crystalline phase .",
