    "the new horizons spacecraft will encounter pluto on july 14@xmath6 2015 ( stern , 2008 ) , after which , if an extended mission is approved , the spacecraft will alter course using onboard fuel reserves to target a more distant , much smaller trans - neptunian object ( tno )",
    ". this post - pluto encounter will likely be the only opportunity for a close flyby with any spacecraft of a member of this distant population of minor planets in the foreseeable future .",
    "no currently known object is accessible with the spacecraft s estimated post - pluto impulse budget of approximately @xmath7 m s@xmath8 , so a coordinated survey effort is ongoing in order to identify and characterize potential targets ( buie 2012 ) .",
    "this survey targets the sky position of objects which will fall into the accessible path of the new horizons spacecraft . in 2011 - 2012",
    "the search fields are very near neptune s trailing triangular lagrange point ( l5 ) .",
    "sheppard & trujillo ( 2010a ) discovered the first l5 neptune trojan , 2008 lc@xmath9 .",
    "our survey for a post - pluto new horizons target has serendipitously yielded the discovery of 2011 hm@xmath0 , a second long - term stable neptune trojan in the l5 cloud .    to date ,",
    "eight other long - term stable neptune trojans are known ; seven of these occupy the leading l4 cloud , and one occupies the trailing l5 cloud .",
    "there are other objects known to be temporarily co - orbital with neptune ; for example , the minor planet center lists 2004 kv@xmath9 as an l5 neptune trojan , but numerical integrations demonstrate that it becomes unstable on very short timescales , indicating that it is likely a scattering tno or centaur which is currently undergoing a transient resonant period , and does not represent a primordial neptune trojan ( gladman et al .",

    "the eight stable neptune trojans occupy a broad range of inclinations ( @xmath10 ) and libration amplitudes ( @xmath11 peak - to - peak , lykawka et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the new l5 neptune trojan identified by our survey is not only stably resonant over gyr timescales , it is also more highly inclined than any other known stable neptune trojan ( @xmath12 ) and brighter than any other known stable l5 trojan object in the solar system ( @xmath13 )",
    ". it may be a candidate for long - range imaging from the new horizons spacecraft in late 2013 , when it flies by at a minimum distance of approximately 1.2 au .",
    "observations from the spacecraft may constrain the phase behavior of the surface at large phase angles , and provide a validation exercise for future long - range imaging of other tnos in the post - pluto mission phase .    in this letter",
    "we outline the discovery circumstances of 2011 hm@xmath0 , its current state of physical and orbital characterization , and prospects for a new horizons long - range observational campaign .",
    "a coordinated observational campaign has been undertaken to identify a post - pluto encounter target for new horizons . between 2004 and 2005 ,",
    "a wide survey of moderate depth was performed with the subaru telescope and the suprimecam imager intended to search for bright candidates . in 2011 the survey strategy",
    "was modified to target the now much smaller core of the sky - plane distribution of accessible objects ( given the current understanding of the orbital distribution of the kuiper belt , eg .",
    "petit et al .",
    "2011 ) with much deeper observations in order to leverage the steep luminosity function of tnos .",
    "magellan megacam and imacs , subaru suprime - cam , and cfht megaprime were all brought to bear on the field in a coordinated effort .",
    "the fields of interest are deep in the galactic plane , near galactic coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( ecliptic @xmath16 , @xmath17 , buie 2012 ) , and are extremely crowded with background stars .",
    "detection of faint moving sources requires high image quality observations and the application of difference imaging to reduce source confusion .",
    "three independent difference imaging pipelines were developed to process the data in parallel , ensuring recovery of as large a fraction of moving objects in the fields as possible .",
    "all observations were referenced to a single master astrometric catalog , produced by the cfht megaprime camera and tied to 2mass astrometry using the megapipe calibration software ( gwyn 2008 ) .",
    "this catalog went much fainter than 2mass , allowing us to utilize long exposure times while still having many non - saturated stars to generate high - precision wcs solutions , and increased the precision and accuracy of our wcs solutions over all imagers we used compared to what would have been possible with the 2mass stars alone .    because the multiple independent pipelines were applied in some cases to the same data , not all astrometric measurements are entirely independent .",
    "see the appendices for a table of astrometry and an extended explanation of our approach to treating astrometric records from multiple pipelines .    in 2011 ,",
    "the target search area was approximately 2 square degrees , though this area was co - moving with the typical rates of tnos accessible to new horizons so the actual sky area is somewhat larger .",
    "cfht , subaru and magellan observations covered subsets of this region to varying depth , typically at least @xmath18 and at the deepest reaching a 50% completeness depth of @xmath19 in the central 0.18 square degree field ( this depth was measured by implanting synthetic moving sources of known brightness into our data , then blindly recovering them with our pipelines simultaneously with real tnos ) . at the current state of reduction",
    ", 25 probable new tnos have been discovered in the 2011 data ( as of the submission of this paper ) .",
    "2011 hm@xmath0 was first detected in magellan imacs observations from july 12 , 2011 , while at a heliocentric distance of @xmath20 au .",
    "recoveries in observations from subaru , magellan , and cfht spanning april 29 , 2011 to august 30 , 2011 indicated that 2011 hm@xmath0 s semi - major axis was consistent with that of neptune , but with large uncertainty . during the first re - observation of the new horizons fields in 2012 ,",
    "early - evening observations were made of 2011 hm@xmath0 ( which is now significantly outside the nominal new horizons survey fields ) and the one - year arc confirmed that the object was in a low - eccentricity orbit with a semi - major axis within @xmath21 of neptune s , consistent with the orbit of an object in 1:1 mean - motion resonance .",
    "all astrometry is available in table a1 .",
    "2011 hm@xmath0 was recovered in a parallel effort by the citizen scientists involved in ice hunters in the data acquired at magellan over april 2930 2011 .",
    "the ice hunters users provided a list of transients for one of our pipelines by identifying sources in difference images by visual inspection .",
    "users that contributed to the recovery are listed in the appendix .",
    "2011 hm@xmath0 is roughly a magnitude brighter ( @xmath22 ) than the next brightest tno discovered . to date",
    ", no other object has been found in any of the new horizons fields which is consistent with a neptune trojan , even though our survey has reached a depth at least 2.5 magnitudes fainter ( from @xmath18 up to @xmath23 ) over the rest of the survey field .",
    "for populations of minor planets with power - law luminosity functions of moderate slope ( @xmath24 ) which are continuous over the dynamic range of a given survey , the peak detection rate is generally found near the survey s 50% completeness magnitude . adopting a heaviside - function efficiency curve truncating at @xmath25 , for any continuous power - law luminosity function with slope @xmath26 steeper than @xmath27",
    ", we would expect @xmath28% of any neptune trojans detected by our survey to be fainter than 2011 hm@xmath0 .",
    "however , if the luminosity function truncates at @xmath29 , as indicated by sheppard & trujillo ( 2010b ) , then much steeper bright - object slopes would be consistent with the detection of a single object with the luminosity of 2011 hm@xmath0 in our survey .",
    "we therefore interpret the detection of 2011 hm@xmath0 along with the lack of any fainter detections as further evidence for a lack of intermediate - size planetesimals as suggested by sheppard & trujillo ( 2010b ) .",
    "the current barycentric orbital elements for 2011 hm@xmath0 are listed in table 1",
    ". of note is its very high inclination of @xmath1 , making it the highest inclination neptune trojan known .",
    "the only other known long - term stable l5 neptune trojan , 2008 lc@xmath9 , also has a high inclination at @xmath30 .",
    "the new horizons survey fields fall approximately @xmath31 from the ecliptic , and so are significantly more sensitive to lower inclination objects .",
    "2011 hm@xmath0 was discovered at an ecliptic latitude of @xmath32 , and given its inclination it spends less than 9% of its time at lower latitudes .",
    "the discovery of such a high inclination trojan prior to the discovery of any low inclination trojans in near - ecliptic fields lends support to the l5 neptune trojans being a highly excited population , as suggested by sheppard & trujillo ( 2010a ) . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath3310% of all jupiter trojans with @xmath34 have higher inclinations than 2011 hm@xmath0 .      using the _ mercury6 _ n - body integrator ( chambers , 1999 ) , we integrated the orbits of 7,000 clones of 2011 hm@xmath0 for @xmath35 years into the future to verify that within its uncertainties it is a long - term resonant object .",
    "these clones were sampled from a multivariate normal prior in the cartesian orbital basis , centered on the best - fit orbit with the covariance matrix generated by the _",
    "fit_radec _ and _ abg_to_xyz _ routines developed in association with bernstein & kushalani ( 2000 ) , assuming uniform astrometric uncertainties of @xmath36 on all data points . after translating their orbits into the heliocentric basis of _ mercury6 _ , the clones were integrated with the @xmath37 integration algorithm , along with the giant planets ( with the mass of the sun augmented by the mass of the terrestrial planets ) . all clones librated stably for the entire @xmath35 year integration . using the lower 3-sigma wilson score interval ( wilson 1927 ) we find that 2011 hm@xmath0 is resonant over @xmath38 years with @xmath39% confidence .",
    "a des - style three - clone , @xmath35 year integration and classification ( elliot et al . 2005 ) also indicates stable trojan behavior over this timescale .",
    "the integrated clones show average libration amplitudes of @xmath40 ( peak - to - peak , measured over individual libration cycles and then averaged ) over the @xmath35 year integration , with libration periods of @xmath41 years .",
    "the maximum libration amplitude over a single libration period experienced by any clone in the entire 10@xmath42 years of integration was 26.5@xmath43 , well inside the limits of long - term stability ( @xmath44 , nesvorn & dones 2002 ) .",
    "the approach of averaging individual libration cycle amplitudes removes the effects of longer - period oscillations in the orbit ; defining the libration amplitude by computing the rms of the resonant argument around its mean and assuming sinusoidal behavior results in an similar value of @xmath45 , while defining the amplitude as the difference between the largest and smallest resonant argument over the entire integration results in a larger estimate of @xmath46 .",
    "regardless of definition , all of these estimates are comfortably within the limits of stability . the mean libration center was found to be @xmath47 , consistent with the ideal center of the l5 cloud .",
    "a subset of 100 clones ( drawn from the same orbital distribution as the larger sample ) were integrated for 1 gyr .",
    "again , no clone became unstable over the integration .",
    "accounting for the smaller sample size , and again adopting the lower 3-sigma wilson score interval , we can assert that 2011 hm@xmath0 is stably resonant over a large fraction of the age of the solar system with @xmath48 confidence .",
    "the maximum libration amplitude reached over a single libration cycle by any of these 100 clones in the entire 1 gyr of integration was 37.1@xmath43 .",

    "other neptune trojans marked with error bars are colors of 2007 vl@xmath5 and 2006 rj@xmath4 measured in this work . ]    on the night of ut may 2324 , 2012 , observations with magellan imacs ( f4 camera , 2@xmath494 array of 2k@xmath494k e2v ccds , @xmath50 binning , in fast read mode ) measured the @xmath3 colors of 2011 hm@xmath0 .",
    "observations were made in photometric conditions , and the landolt standard 107 351 ( landolt 1992 : @xmath51 , slightly bluer than known neptune trojans @xmath52 , sheppard & trujillo 2006 ) was observed over the same airmass range ( @xmath53 ) to determine photometric zero - points and extinction coefficients ( no color term corrections were calculated or applied ) .",
    "exposure times for 2011 hm@xmath0 were 300s in each filter , and filters were cycled four times throughout the observations to ensure that any rotational lightcurve ( though no evidence was seen for one ) would not affect the color measurements . by choosing a standard star with similar color indices to our target population ,",
    "we minimize potential differences between the sdss photometric system and the native system of the imacs camera and filters due to un - characterized color terms .",
    "due to field crowding , photometry was performed on difference images , thus the reduction of the target was unavoidably different from the reduction of the ( stationary ) standard star .",
    "the images in each band were psf - matched ( using the isis package , alard & lupton 1998 ) to the image in that band taken at lowest airmass ( to limit the propagation of extinction correction error from our photometric standard calibration ) .",
    "a template image was constructed by taking the minimum pixel value across the stack of the four psf - matched images in each band , which was then subtracted off of each psf - matched image .",
    "the motion of the target was sufficient that in the four visits in each filter , the psf of the source did not overlap in all images in any pixel  but the motion was not so great as to cause any significant elongation of the target s psf .",
    "at this point , since all images are photometrically scaled to the image taken at lowest airmass , we estimated the zero - points and extinction coefficients for all difference images based on the lowest observed airmass in that band .",
    "photometry was extracted with a fixed aperture radius of @xmath54 fwhm , and while aperture corrections were determined for each image independently ( from the psf - matched , yet un - subtracted images ) , all were effectively identical ( as expected from the psf - matching ) .",
    "the solar system object search ( ssos ) service ( gwyn , hill & kavelaars 2012 ) provided by the canadian astronomy data centre also turned up un - published color measurements of two bright l4 neptune trojans  2007 vl@xmath5 , and 2006 rj10 .",
    "these data were collected by the cfht megaprime camera in photometric conditions in november of 2010 through @xmath3 filters .",
    "the megapipe software ( gwyn 2008 ) was used to perform photometric calibration for these data , and photometry for the two trojans was extracted from the calibrated images .",
    "the measured color indices were then transformed into the sdss system .",
    "table 1 lists the @xmath3 colors of all three objects , as well as these colors translated into the _ bvri _ system using the transformations from smith ( 2002 ) .",
    "these transformations were verified as accurate for similar tno surfaces by sheppard & trujillo ( 2006 ) .",
    "we find that the colors of 2011 hm@xmath0 are moderately red ; entirely consistent with the l4 neptune trojans measured by sheppard & trujillo ( 2006 ) as well as those measured here . in general the colors of the neptune trojans are consistent with the neutral centaurs or the jupiter trojans ( @xmath55 , fornasier et al .",
    "2007 ) ; figure 1 demonstrates the color of 2011 hm@xmath0 , the l4 neptune trojans , and their relation to other populations .",
    "the similar colors of the l4 trojans and 2011 hm@xmath0 supports both the l4 and l5 neptune trojan clouds sharing a common composition and environmental history , suggestive of a common origin .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of a long - term stable l5 ( trailing ) neptune trojan in data acquired to search for candidate trans - neptunian objects for the new horizons spacecraft to fly by during an extended post - pluto mission . </S>",
    "<S> this neptune trojan , 2011 hm@xmath0 , has the highest inclination ( @xmath1 ) of any known member of this population . </S>",
    "<S> it is intrinsically brighter than any single l5 jupiter trojan at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined its @xmath3 colors ( a first for any l5 neptune trojan ) , which we find to be similar to the moderately red colors of the l4 neptune trojans , suggesting similar surface properties for members of both trojan clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we also present colors derived from archival data for two l4 neptune trojans ( 2006 rj@xmath4 and 2007 vl@xmath5 ) , better refining the overall color distribution of the population . in this document </S>",
    "<S> we describe the discovery circumstances , our physical characterization of 2011 hm@xmath0 , and this object s implications for the neptune trojan population overall . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the prospects for detecting 2011 hm@xmath0 from the new horizons spacecraft during their close approach in mid- to late-2013 . </S>"
