    "they include    * the determination of @xmath0 over a wide range of scales : the dijet cross section is proportional to @xmath3 at leading order ( lo ) , thus suggesting a direct measurement of the strong coupling constant .",
    "however , the lo calculation leaves the renormalization scale @xmath4 undetermined .",
    "the nlo corrections substantially reduce the renormalization and factorization scale dependencies which are present in the lo calculations and thus reliable cross section predictions in terms of @xmath5 ( for a given set of parton distributions ) are made possible . * the measurement of the gluon density in the proton ( via @xmath6 ) : the gluon density can only be indirectly constrained by an analysis of the structure function @xmath7 at hera @xcite .",
    "the boson gluon fusion subprocess dominates the two jet cross section at low @xmath1 and allows for a more direct measurement of the gluon density in this regime .",
    "a first lo experimental analysis has been presented in @xcite .",
    "nlo corrections reduce the factorization scale dependence in the lo calculation ( due to the intital state collinear factorization , which introduces a mixture of the quark and gluon densities according to the altarelli - parisi evolution ) and thus reliable cross section predictions in terms of the scale dependent parton distributions are made possible .",
    "* the study of internal jet structure : nlo corrections in jet physics imply that a jet ( in a given jet definition scheme ) may consist of two partons .",
    "thus first sensitivity to the internal jet structure is obtained , like dependence on the cone size or on recombination prescriptions .",
    "these studies are also important for reliable qcd studies ( such as the @xmath8 or gluon density determinations ) .",

    "the determination of the polarized gluon structure function ( via @xmath6 ) in polarized electron on polarized proton scattering @xcite : the measurement of the polarized parton densities and in particular the polarized gluon density from dijet production at a polarized electron proton machine at hera energies would allow to discriminate between the different pictures of the proton spin underlying these parametrizations .",
    "we will analyze these effects in a subsequent publication .",
    "some theoretical aspects related to these studies are discussed in the following .",
    "the goal of a versatile nlo calculation is to allow for an easy implementation of an arbitrary jet algorithm or to impose any kinematical resolution and acceptance cuts on the final state particles .",
    "this is best achieved by performing all hard phase space integrals numerically , with a monte carlo integration technique .",
    "this approach also allows an investigation of the recombination scheme dependence of the nlo jet cross sections . for dijet production at hera",
    "such a nlo monte carlo program is mepjet .",

    "the real emission corrections involve @xmath15 and analogous anti - quark initiated processes .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are calculated by numerically evaluating the tree level helicity amplitudes as given in ref .",
    "the tree level matrix elements are numerically checked against the matrix elements in @xcite .",
    "they need to be integrated over the entire phase space , including the unresolved regions , where only two jets are reconstructed according to a given jet definition scheme . in order to isolate the infrared as well as collinear divergencies associated with these unresolved regions the resolution parameter @xmath16",
    "is introduced .",
    "this @xmath16 technique has already been successfully applied to next - to - leading order calculations of jet cross sections in @xmath17 annihilation and in hadronic collisions  @xcite .",
    "soft and collinear approximations are used in the region where at least one pair of partons , including initial ones , has @xmath18 and the soft and/or collinear final state parton is integrated over analytically . factorizing the collinear initial state divergencies into the bare parton distribution functions and adding this soft+collinear part to the @xmath19 virtual contributions for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 subprocesses",
    "gives a finite result for , effectively , 2-parton final states .",
    "in general this 2-parton contribution is negative and grows logarithmically in magnitude as @xmath16 is decreased .",
    "this logarithmic growth is exactly cancelled by the increase in the 3 parton cross section , once @xmath16 is small enough for the approximations to be valid .    as mentioned before the collinear initial state divergencies are factorized into the bare parton densities introducing a dependence on the factorization scale @xmath20 .",
    "in order to handle these singularities we follow ref .",

    "therefore , the effective 2-parton final state ( soft+collinear+virtual part ) does not depend on the recombination scheme .",
    "the essential benefit of the monte carlo approach in mepjet is that all hard phase space integrals over the region @xmath21 are performed numerically . since , at each phase space point , the parton 4-momenta are available , the program is flexible enough to implement arbitrary jet algorithms and kinematical resolution and acceptance cuts .    for the numerical studies below ,",

    "we require 40  gev@xmath31 gev@xmath23 , @xmath32 , an energy cut of @xmath33  gev on the scattered electron , and a cut on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath34 of the scattered lepton and jets of @xmath35 .",
    "in addition jets must have transverse momenta of at least 2  gev in both the lab and the breit frame .    within these",
    "general cuts four different jet definition schemes are considered for which we have chosen parameters such as to give similar lo cross sections .",
    "note however , that the phase space region for the accepted dijet events depends on the jetalgorithm and thus somewhat different event sets would be considered in an actual experiment . unless stated otherwise , and for all jet algorithms , we use the @xmath36-scheme to recombine partons , i.e. the cluster momentum is taken as @xmath37 , the sum of the 4-momenta of partons @xmath29 and @xmath38 , if these are unresolved according to a given jet definition scheme .",

    ", @xmath16 is an arbitrary theoretical parameter and any measurable quantity should not depend on it .",
    "one observes that for values smaller than 0.1  gev@xmath23 the results are indeed independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the strong @xmath16 dependence of the nlo cross sections for larger values shows that the soft and collinear approximations used in the phase space region @xmath57 are no longer valid , _",
    "i.e. _ terms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 become important .",
    "in general , one wants to choose @xmath16 as large as possible to avoid large cancellations between the virtual+collinear+soft part ( @xmath57 ) and the hard part of the phase space ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that factor 10 cancellations occur between the effective 2-parton and 3-parton final states at the lowest @xmath16 values in fig .",
    "1 and hence very high monte carlo statistics is required for these points .",
    "@xmath16 independence is achieved at and below @xmath60  gev@xmath23 and we choose this value for our further studies .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the importance of higher order corrections and recombination scheme dependencies @xcite of the two jet cross sections for the four jet algorithms .",
    "while the higher order corrections and recombination scheme dependencies in the cone and @xmath54 schemes are small , very large corrections appear in the @xmath39-scheme . in addition , the large effective @xmath61-factor ( defined as @xmath62 ) of 2.04 ( 2.02 ) for the two - jet inclusive ( exclusive ) cross section in the @xmath39-scheme depends strongly on the recombination scheme which is used in the clustering algorithm .",
    "such large dependencies are subject to potentially large higher order uncertainties , since the recombination dependence is only simulated at tree level in the nlo calculation .",
    "the large corrections and recombination scheme dependencies in particular in the @xmath39 scheme can partly be traced to large single jet masses ( compared to their energy in the parton center of mass frame ) . as has been shown in @xcite , 50 % of the events in the nlo cross section for the @xmath39 scheme ( with the @xmath36 recombination scheme )",

    "the very large median value of @xmath64 in the @xmath39-scheme implies that at nlo we are dealing with very different types of jets than at lo , and this difference accounts for the large @xmath61-factor .    in the jade - algorithm the @xmath61-factor",
    "is reduced from 1.48 in the @xmath36-scheme to 1.36 and 1.24 in the @xmath65 and @xmath66-schemes or the jade scheme in table i disagree with previous calculations @xcite .",
