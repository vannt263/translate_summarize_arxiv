    "the dynamics of black strings has been the subject of significant attention in recent years and several results have appeared in the literature indicating the evolution of a sufficiently long perturbed blackstring is likely richer than anticipated .",
    "considerable interest was initially sparked when gregory and laflamme @xcite , noted that in linearized perturbation theory black strings longer than a certain length become unstable .",
    "the work of horowitz and maeda shows that if the spacetime continues to be asymptotically predictable , black strings can not pinch - off in finite affine time @xcite and also presents additional arguments against the pinch - off possibility in lieu of the perturbed string evolving towards a stationary non - uniform string .",
    "this suggestion has spurred several papers and conjectures about what fate a perturbed string might encounter ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is not yet agreement on what the final fate might be and different analyses are being carried out to shed light on this issue .",
    "for instance , stationary solutions which are non - uniform in the extra dimension have been obtained @xcite but their entropy ( for dimensions lower than @xmath0 @xcite ) is too large for these solutions to be the end point of the dynamical evolution envisaged by horowitz and maeda@xcite .",
    "further analysis of highly distorted stationary strings have revealed the spacetime around the neck approaches one having a conical structure .",
    "it is therefore conjectured that a perturbed string can pinch - off discontinuously , experiencing a conical phase@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have also been presented which reveal the rich dynamics of a perturbed black string , where the initially exponentially fast varying geometry characterizing the ( highly distorted ) horizon neighborhood gives rise to a later stage where the dynamics are significantly slowed down @xcite .",
    "although lack of resolution prevented pushing the simulation further , a study of the late stages of the solution indicated that the possibility of the horizon pinching off in infinite affine time is quite possible @xcite . extrapolating the observed results further , the pinching off , if it happens , could proceed in a smooth way . though this possibility , as well as all other conjectures , awaits for numerical evolutions for a definitive statement .",
    "there is still much to be understood before a clear picture of the problem emerges .",
    "it turns out interesting information can be extracted by considering a sequence of initial data which aims to probe a region close to a bifurcation scenario .",
    "this line of work has been previously pursued by sorkin and piran @xcite inspired by related work in the study of binary black hole collisions . at the core of the idea",
    "is to find particular solutions at a given instant of time ( thus satisfying the constraint equations ) which describe a highly distorted black string ( as judged by their apparent horizons ) and examine what occurs as this distortion is made more extreme .",
    "the constraints are solved in the presence of a matter source with at least one free parameter characterizing its size . by varying this parameter",
    ", one can find hyperspherical black holes when the source is sufficiently compact and localized or black strings when the source is compact but distributed along the extra dimension . by fine - tuning this parameter",
    "one can thus study what type of transition is observed in highly distorted cases . to simplify the task of finding consistent data in the presence of this source a moment of time symmetry can be chosen , and so the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied .",
    "the solution of the hamiltonian constraint yields the data sought after . once this is found ,",
    "an analysis of the apparent horizon at that hypersurface gives an indication of what the behavior may be .",
    "unfortunately , this approach can not give the event horizon behavior , but since it must contain the apparent horizon , the latter does give some indication of how the former behaves .    in the present work we study the problem and obtain numerical solutions for a variety of sources which are chosen to probe deeply the transition region between black holes and strings .",
    "we consider a @xmath1 dimensional spacetime endowed with a @xmath2 symmetry and develop a code able to yield solutions of the initial data problem for einstein s equations at a moment of time symmetry in the presence of an arbitrary chosen source .",
    "this allows us to probe a family of solutions interpolating between hyperspherical black holes and black strings . to do so",
    ", we examine a sequence of solutions describing distorted black holes and strings and study their properties .",
    "we define such a sequence by varying the source while keeping the two relevant scales in the problem namely the adm mass per unit length of the spacetime and the asymptotic length of the extra dimension constant .",
    "this fact , coupled to the ability of examining arbitrary spherical dimensions and the use of computational techniques that let us probe significantly distorted strings are the main differences with the work presented in @xcite . as we will see",
    ", our results agree with most of those presented there , but also interesting differences arise .",
    "most importantly , we are able to produce arbitrarily distorted strings by appropriately varying the source considered . by analyzing these strings , we find features common to the solutions found in simulations of perturbed black strings which could explain the slow down of the dynamics observed there @xcite .",
    "the analysis of allowed solutions in arbitrary dimensions has recently revealed a possible interesting behavior at large enough dimensions @xcite through a linearized analysis of the solution s behavior .",
    "indeed these results would indicate in dimensions @xmath3 the conjecture of horowitz  maeda , namely that a perturbed string might settle down to a non - uniform stationary string , is quite more plausible than in lower dimensional cases .",
    "this is hinted by the behavior of thermodynamical quantities which revealed the transition from a uniform string to a distorted one is continuous for high enough dimensions .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider finding solutions for arbitrary dimensions and examine the possible differences that may arise .",
    "if this marked transition at sufficiently high dimensions is robust beyond the linear regime , its effects would likely be evident in the solutions obtained .",
    "however , obtaining such solutions in large dimensions is a delicate enterprise since fields near the origin acquire a much steeper gradient .",
    "furthermore , if one is interested in constructing highly distorted situations in particular to discern the behavior at a threshold of a very thin string numerical techniques capable of probing these scenarios must be employed . we thus adopt the following strategy to construct a code capable of dealing with these issues .",
    "we begin by extending the same approach followed in @xcite .",
    "we consider time - symmetric , space - like hypersurfaces and choose a conformally flat metric for simplicity : @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the dimension of a spacetime with @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "while the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied , the hamiltonian constraint becomes @xmath5 \\left [ \\frac{\\left ( d-4 \\right ) \\left ( d-3 \\right)}{2 }   - 1 \\right]/\\left(d-2\\right )                    + \\rho \\psi^3 = 0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : constraint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following the arguments given in @xcite , a well posed problem to solve for @xmath6 from eq .",
    "[ eqn : constraint ] can be obtained if the matter density is rescaled as @xmath7 .",
    "we solve the resulting equation with the use of finite element techniques .",
    "this enables a smooth mesh grading to support higher resolution near the matter density . converting eq .",
    "[ eqn : constraint ] into the weak form for finite element simulation also conveniently removes the coordinate singularity at @xmath8 .",
    "simulations used bilinear quadrilateral elements with full approximation scheme ( fas ) multigrid as the solver @xcite .",
    "we used the diffpack finite element toolkit @xcite in all development and production runs .    in the present paper we concentrate on the @xmath9 case both for testing purposes and to re - examine the results in @xcite with a well defined sequence that keeps both the adm mass and the asymptotic length of the extra dimension fixed",
    "we do so by appropriately varying the source .",
    "the results for higher dimensions will be presented elsewhere .    in five dimensions , eq .",
    "[ eqn : constraint ] becomes @xmath10 we chose @xmath11 for all simulations in the present case .",
    "the non - physical density @xmath12 was chosen to be @xmath13                + a\\exp\\left(-r^2/\\sigma_a^2\\right )   \\exp\\left(-z^2/\\sigma_b^2\\right ) , \\label{eqn : source}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the first term of this source is also identical to reference @xcite .",
    "the second term of the source is intended to increase the distortion of the black object horizon by increasing the matter density in the periodic direction close to @xmath8 .    in our sequence of solutions ,",
    "the amplitude , @xmath18 was varied to ensure the adm mass remained the same for all density distributions .",
    "the size of the periodic dimension , @xmath19 , was chosen identical to reference @xcite ( @xmath20 ) and longer ( @xmath21 ) so as to cover cases above and below gregory ",
    "laflamme s critical length .",
    "the adopted boundary conditions are as those in @xcite : reflection symmetries , @xmath22 along @xmath8 and @xmath23 along @xmath24 ; periodicity , @xmath25 along @xmath26 ; and robin , @xmath27 , at the @xmath28 outer boundary .",
    "the last condition ensures the asymptotic length of the extra dimension is constant .",
    "all our simulations have been carried out for different locations of the outer boundary given by @xmath29 without observing significant differences in the obtained solution .",
    "variations in the non - physical density distribution can produce either black strings or hyperspherical black holes . locating",
    "the apparent horizon indicates the type of black object present in the initial data .",
    "the apparent horizon is the outermost surface of zero - expansion of null rays . for initial data with vanishing extrinsic curvature",
    ", the apparent horizon satisfies @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the spatial indices of the space - like normal to the horizon surface . for black string solutions ,",
    "we consider the function @xmath32 and find the surface where @xmath33 by solving eq .",
    "[ eqn : horizon ] .",
    "for black hole solutions , we transform to spherical coordinates @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , following the approach described in @xcite .",
    "we then consider the function @xmath37 and locate the surface where @xmath33 .",
    "the code was tested using an independent residual evaluator .",
    "additionally , it was tested by recovering uniform black string and hyperspherical black hole solutions .",
    "further tests were conducted comparing cases using two entirely different finite element toolkits , flexpde @xcite and diffpack @xcite .",
    "the tests cases employed adaptive triangular meshes in the flexpde toolkit and graded quadrilateral meshes in the diffpack toolkit , with excellent agreement . in all cases , good convergence of the solution was observed .",
    "for instance , figure [ fig : convergence ] shows the error as reported by the independent residual evaluator for a uniform black string along the radius at @xmath38 at three resolutions .",
    "the convergence in the l2 norm is slightly better than first order .",
    "as expected , the absolute error is larger near the artificial matter distribution .",
    "a sense of the relative error with respect to the defined source is given by monitoring the error divided by @xmath39 .",
    "all results apart from the convergence tests used resolutions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , unless otherwise noted .    after validating the code",
    ", we proceeded to study both distorted strings and hyperspherical black holes .",
    "we first considered the behavior of distorted hyperspherical black holes . using the source given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : source ] , we fix both @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be 0.1 . this choice would produce a uniform hyperspherical black hole if the second term of eq .",
    "[ eqn : source ] were absent .",
    "we employ this second term to generate sequences of initial data by using increasingly larger @xmath44 values which produce more distorted black holes until a black string horizon results , holding @xmath45 constant .",
    "four classes of data are generated , each with a particular value for @xmath45 .",
    "the smaller the @xmath45 choice is , the more distorted the resulting horizon will appear . see figure [ fig : horizons ] .",
    "a useful quantity to monitor whether a black hole can be distorted so as to approach a black string is to consider the proper length between the two poles , as done in @xcite .",
    "we thus evaluate this quantity by considering @xmath46    for each of the four sequences of initial data , all approach @xmath47 even though the initial data generated using the smallest @xmath45 choices produced more distorted black holes than the largest choices .",
    "the deformation of the hole , @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 the proper distance along the @xmath51 and @xmath28 axis .",
    "the results for @xmath52 for different cases are shown in figure [ fig : distance ] .",
    "clearly , as indicated by the apparent horizon , there does seem to be an upper limit as to how close the poles can be even when black hole horizons could be found to be more distorted .",
    "this would indicate that the spacetime in between the poles is becoming considerably curved .",
    "we now turn our attention to a family of gradually more distorted black strings .",
    "the distortion of a black string , @xmath53 , is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the maximum / minimum areal radius of the apparent horizon .",
    "we fix @xmath56 and vary @xmath45 and @xmath44 ; this gives rise to black string solutions with large degree of distortions ( see figure [ fig : strings ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have found distortions up to @xmath57 without anything to prevent obtaining even larger distortions ( apart from discretization issues ) . to make this more evident figure [ fig : phase ] illustrates what the distortion @xmath53 vs @xmath44 is for three different values of @xmath45 ( recall that @xmath58 govern the source s deformation along @xmath28,@xmath51 directions ) . the same behavior is evident when the periodic dimension is larger than the gregory  laflamme critical length ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xstring ] ) .",
    "finally , we examine the kretschmann invariant @xmath59 value for different members of the sequence , in particular we consider the quantity @xmath60 which , as mentioned in @xcite , would give a value of @xmath61 for a uniform hyperspherical black hole while @xmath62 for a uniform stationary black string .",
    "interestingly , near the origin , the value of this invariant is close to @xmath61 while relatively close to @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , the region in between behaves in a way quite similar to that found at the late stages of the evolution in @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that the slow down observed there might be a result of the dynamical solution approaching a time symmetric phase .",
    "if this were the case it would give support to the conjecture that a `` breathing '' scenario might take place  @xcite .",
    "in this picture the deformed black string would reach a stage where the trend would reverse itself ; that is the waist of the string would grow while the bulge would shrink .",
    "whether this takes place would have to be elucidated by numerical evolutions .",
    "in the present work we have developed a code based on finite element techniques capable of providing solutions of the constraints describing highly distorted black holes and black strings in spacetimes with arbitrary dimensions @xmath1 endowed with an @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "we employed such code to investigate a sequence of solutions which contain a marginally trapped surface where both the adm mass and the asymptotic length of the extra ( periodic ) dimension are kept fixed .",
    "we have concentrated on the @xmath9 case to make contact with results presented in the literature .",
    "( the higher dimensional case is under investigation ) .",
    "the solutions are obtained by providing an arbitrary source ( subject to the requirements of the sequence ) which can be varied in different regions so as to produce highly distorted black holes and string .",
    "our solutions cover both stable and unstable regimes as far as the the ratio @xmath64 is concerned and the observed behavior is qualitatively similar in both cases .",
    "a study of the sequences obtained reveals several interesting features .",
    "first , arbitrary distortions can be obtained both in the black string and black hole phases .",
    "second , even though we can produce arbitrary distorted black holes , the proper distance between the poles seem to have an upper limit in how close these can be made to be as judged by the apparent horizon .",
    "third , we see no evidence of a conical structure developing at or near the waist in the apparent horizon region .",
    "the spacetime is smooth in the horizon s vicinity .",
    "note however that the apparent horizon would miss a conical structure at the event horizon unless the spacetime were stationary .",
    "last , the curvature invariant of the apparent horizon corresponding to highly distorted black strings would indicate that the bulge of the horizon approaches a hyperspherical black hole while the neck approaches a black string .",
    "interestingly , this is quite similar to the results obtained at the late stages of the black string simulations presented in @xcite .",
