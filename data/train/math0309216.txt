    "obtaining volume formulae for basic polyhedra is one of the basic and important problems in geometry . in hyperbolic space",
    "this problem has been attacked from its birth . an _ orthoscheme _ is a simplex of a generalization ( with respect to dimensions ) of a right triangle . since any hyperbolic polyhedra can be decomposed into finite number of orthoschemes , the first step of solving the problem is to obtain a volume formula for orthoschemes . in three - dimensional case",
    ", n.  i.  lobachevsky @xcite found in 1839 a volume formula for orthoschemes .",
    "thus the next step is to find a formula for ordinary tetrahedra .",
    "although the lengths of six edges of tetrahedra determine their sizes and shapes , in hyperbolic space it is known that the six dihedral angles also plays the same role .",
    "actually the valuables of the lobachevsky s formula mentioned above are dihedral angles , and following this way in this paper we obtain a volume formula for _ generalized _ hyperbolic tetrahedra in terms of the six dihedral angles ( the meaning of the term  generalized \" will be explained later ) .",
    "here we note that , by the fact mentioned previous paragraph , we can construct such a formula from that of orthoschemes .",
    "but in this case we have to calculate the dihedral angles of orthoschemes from those of tetrahedra .",
    "it is emphasized that what we want to obtain is the formula being able to calculate directly from the dihedral angles of a given generalized tetrahedron .",
    "the first answer to this problem was ( at least the author is aware ) given by w .- y .",
    "hsiang in 1988 . in @xcite",
    "the formula was presented through an integral expression . on the other hand , many volume formulae for hyperbolic polyhedra is presented via lobachevsky function or the dilogarithm function ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the first such presentation was given by y.  cho and h.  kim in 1999 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their formula was derived from that of ideal tetrahedra , and has the following particular property : due to the way of the proof it is not symmetric with respect to the dihedral angles .",
    "thus the next problem is to obtain its essentially symmetrical expression .",
    "such a formula was obtained by j.  murakami and m.  yano in about 2001 . in @xcite",
    "they derived it from the quantum @xmath0-symbol , but the proof is to reduce it to cho - kim s one .",
    "in hyperbolic space it is possible to consider that vertices of a polyhedron lie  outside the space and its sphere at infinity . \" for each such vertex there is a canonical way to cut off the vertex with its neighborhood .",
    "this operation is called a _ truncation _ at the vertex , which will be defined more precisely in section  [ sec_exist ] , and we thus obtain convex polyhedron ( possibly non - compact ) with finite volume .",
    "such a polyhedron appears , for example , as fundamental polyhedra for hyperbolic coxeter groups or building blocks of three - dimensional hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "since the volume of hyperbolic manifolds are topological invariants , it is meaningful , also for @xmath1-manifold theory , to obtain a volume formula for such polyhedra .",
    "r.  kellerhals presented in 1989 that the formula for orthoschemes can be applied , without any modification , to  mildly \" truncated ones at _ principal vertices _ ( see appendix for the definition and @xcite for the formula ) .",
    "this result inspires that murakami - yano s formula also may be applied to _ generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra _ , tetrahedra of each vertices being finite , ideal or truncated ( see definition  [ df_trunc ] for precise definition ) , and this is what we will prove in this paper ( see theorem  [ thm_volumeformula ] ) .",
    "here we note that , although the lengths of the edges emanating from a vertex at infinity are infinity , the dihedral angles may be finite .",
    "this is another reason why we take not the edge lengths but the dihedral angles as the valuables of our volume formula .    the key tool for the proof is so - called schlfli s differential formula , a simple description for the volume differential of polyhedra as a function of the dihedral angles and the volume of the apices .",
    "since the volume formula is a function of the dihedral angles , to apply schlfli s differential formula we have to translate the dihedral angles of a generalized tetrahedron to the lengths of its edges .",
    "this requirement yields a necessary and sufficient condition of a set of positive numbers to be the dihedral angles of a generalized simplex ( see theorem  [ thm_exist ] ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a generalized tetrahedron in the three - dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath3 whose dihedral angles are @xmath4 . here",
    "the configuration of the dihedral angles are as follows ( see also figure  [ fig_tetraangle ] ) : three edges corresponding to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 arise from a vertex , and the angle @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) is put on the edge opposite to that of @xmath5 ( resp .",

    "the dihedral angle varies from @xmath80 to @xmath226 .",
    "the angle @xmath80 corresponds to the regular ideal octahedron as we saw in theorem  [ thm_max ] , and the angle @xmath227 corresponds to the euclidean regular tetrahedron , corresponding to infinitesimally small hyperbolic regular tetrahedra .",
    "the dihedral angle of the regular ideal tetrahedron is @xmath228 .",
    "in this paper it is assumed that the truncation of a tetrahedron is  mild , \" namely each faces obtained by the truncations do not intersect each other in @xmath229 ( this is equivalent to the assumption of the interior of all edges intersecting @xmath213 ; see definition  [ df_trunc ] ) .",
    "what happens if we do not assume this condition , i.e. , if the truncation is  intense \" ?",
    "a three - dimensional _ orthoscheme _ is a tetrahedron with dihedral angles @xmath230 ( see @xcite for details ; another basic reference is @xcite ) .",
    "then the edge spanned by @xmath187 and @xmath188 is perpendicular to the face spanned by @xmath231 , and also the face spanned by @xmath232 is perpendicular to the edge spanned by @xmath189 and @xmath186 , which is the meaning of  an _ orthoscheme _ is a simplex of a generalization ( with respect to dimensions ) of a right triangle \" mentioned in introduction .",
    "two vertices @xmath187 and @xmath186 are called _",
    "principal vertices_.    for an orthoscheme , if two faces obtained by truncations at principal vertices intersect each other in the hyperbolic space , then the polyhedron becomes a cube with all faces lambert quadrilaterals ( i.e. , quadrilaterals with one acute and three right angles ) .",
    "such a cube is called _",
    "lambert cube_. in @xcite she also constructed a volume formula for lambert cubes .",
    "this formula is closely related to the one for orthoschemes , so the following problem naturally arises :      one of the first step of solving this problem is to see the relationship between the formula for mildly truncated orthoschemes in @xcite and our formula .",
    "her formula is presented via lobachevsky functions , and we can easily rewrite our formula with respect to it ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath233 ) ) . theoretically ours contains hers , but there is no direct transformation .",
