    "optomechanical system by coupling mechanical resonators to the fields of optical cavities can provide us available device to observe quantum mechanical behaviors of macroscopic system .",
    "it has been proved that entanglement of two resonators and of cavity and mirror can be generated by radiation pressure @xcite , while the pressure can be used to cool down the mirrors @xcite , and the analogy electromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon may happen in cavity optomechanical system @xcite and has demonstrated in experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , optomechanical system can be used as transducers for long - distance quantum communication @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the observation of strict quantum effects in quantum optics relies on the existence of strong nonlinear interaction between photons @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , photons tend to interact only weakly , thus enhancement of photon - photon interaction at the few - photon level is still a challenge in quantum optics .",
    "a lot of efforts are devoted to enhance the nonlinearity of photons @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown us that an optomechanical system can lead to nonlinear kerr effect , but it is very weak ( proportion to @xmath0 ) because usually the radiation pressure coupling strength @xmath1 is less than the frequency of the oscillator @xmath2 for weak coupling system .",
    "most recently , ludwig et .",
    "@xcite propose a scheme to enhance cross - kerr nonlinearity in double cavities with membrane in the middle where the tunnel rate between cavities weaken the negative influence of large value of the oscillator frequency .",
    "optomechanics experiments are rapidly approaching the single - photon strong - coupling regime @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however , for weakly driven systems @xcite , rabl @xcite has shown that photon blockade under single - photon strong coupling condition is affected by @xmath4 where for @xmath5 , no significant further improvement of the nonlinearity is achieved , and the nonlinear effects are suppressed by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , improving the nonlinearity beyond strong - coupling means deserves our investigation . in this paper , we consider weakly driven system with weak coupling @xmath7 and @xmath8 and put forward an alternative scheme to enhance and to modulate the photon - photon and photon - phonon cross - kerr nonlinearity by employing atomic coherence .",
    "we also show the nondemolition measurement of phonon and photon . comparing the scheme with max , rabl , num ,",
    "the photon - photon and photon - phonon cross - kerr nonlinearities not only can be enhanced but also can be controlled .",
    "we do not need single - photon strong coupling condition , which means that our scheme maybe easier to be realized .",
    "we consider atomic media trapped in a doubly resonant cavity with one partially transmitting fixed mirror and one movable mirror ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the two cavity modes with frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 couple to atomic transition @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the same detuning @xmath13 , and the classical laser field with rabi frequency @xmath14 interacts with the atoms between the transition @xmath15 with detuning @xmath16 .",
    "our model is similar with quantum beat laser @xcite except with one movable mirror .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hybrid system is given by     and @xmath17 with detuning @xmath18 , while the classical field drive the atomic level between @xmath15 with detuning @xmath19.,width=321,height=188 ]     @xmath20the free energy of fields and the atoms as well as their interaction is    @xmath21 ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term describes the energy of the two cavity modes with lowering operator @xmath22 and cavity frequency @xmath23 ( at equilibrium position ) .",
    "the second term represents the energy of the atoms and the interaction between the atoms and the cavity fields , where @xmath24 is the spin operator of the atoms , @xmath25 is the coupling between the cavity and the atoms , and @xmath14 is the rabi frequency of the classical field driving the atoms between @xmath26 and @xmath27    where the first term is the free energy of the mechanical oscillator with frequency @xmath2 , and the second term represents the coupling between the non - polarized two - mode fields and the mechanical resonator with radiation - pressure coupling @xmath28 , and the form of the coupling has been employed to cool the mirror in @xcite .",
    "we will show that the coupling among the cavity fields and the resonator can enhance the nonlinearity .",
    "@xmath29    describes the two - mode cavity fields driven by weak classical fields .",

    ". then @xmath33 ,   \\label{haf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the frequency difference between the two cavity modes .",
    "for simplicity , we have assume @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "one can see that the hamiltonian ( [ hfo ] ) contains the terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 which are the typically nondegenerate parametric amplification .",
    "that means , under certain range of parameters , one can obtain squeezed states between one of the cavity modes and the mechanical resonator .",
    "in addition , it had been shown in @xcite that the output field exhibits squeezing for single mode cavity optomechanics system under strong drive condition .",
    "for the present coupling system , the squeezing properties of the cavity fields deserve our further investigation using linearized theory under strongly driven condition .",
    "but , we here focus on the nonlinearity enhancement and show that the form of the coupling in ( [ hfo ] ) plays an important role for enhancement of the nonlinearity .",
    "firstly , we consider large detuning condition and derive the effective hamiltonian of @xmath41 ( [ haf2 ] ) , and the motions for the atomic operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by @xmath44under the large detuning conditions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , eq . ( [ elim ] )",
    "can be solved adiabatically by taking @xmath47 .",
    "the adiabatic solutions of @xmath42 and @xmath48 can then be substituted into the hamiltonian ( [ haf2 ] ) .",
    "the most of the atoms are in their ground state @xmath49 , thus , by elimination of the atomic variables the effective hamiltonian describing the interaction between the two mode fields can be written as@xmath50    where@xmath51with @xmath52 .",
    "we see that an additional interaction term between the two - mode cavity fields is introduced because of the interaction between atomic media and the fields . as shown in fig.1",
    ", the two - mode fields interact with the atoms between the transitions latexmath:[$%",
    "@xmath49 @xmath54@xmath26 ( similar with v - type configuration ) . even though most of the atoms are in their ground state , the participation of the atoms still induce a beam splitter type interaction shown in eq.([haff ] ) .",
    "it is the term proportional to the number of atoms that enhances the cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "although we study the large detuning case , the value of @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be large , because it is proportional to the number of atoms ; therefore we can switch into a picture rotating with @xmath57 @xmath58 and treat the other terms as perturbation . in order to do that ,",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ haff ] ) by defining @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and then we have @xmath61with@xmath62now we jointly consider hamiltonian ( [ hfo ] ) and ( [ haff2 ] ) and switch into a picture rotating with @xmath63 .",
    "then , we use the effective hamiltonian method proposed in @xcite and have the effective hamiltonian as @xmath64+u_{1}\\hat{c}_{1}^{\\dag } \\hat{c}_{1}+u_{2}\\hat{c}_{2}^{\\dag } \\hat{c% } _ { 2 } ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where@xmath65g^{2 } ,   \\notag \\\\",

    "therefore , to enhance the cross - kerr nonlinearity , we should decrease @xmath84 . if @xmath85 , the nonlinearity is larger than @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the frequency difference @xmath69 between two modes and the frequency difference @xmath87 between quasi - mode @xmath88 and @xmath82 can favor us do that .",
    "we can achieve our target by controlling the number of atoms and keep an appropriate value of @xmath69 .",
    "of course , in the above process , we should keep \\{@xmath89,@xmath90 so as to meet the condition of effective hamiltonian approximation . comparing with @xcite where the tunneling rate between two cavities is the key factor to enhance the nonlinearity ,",
    "the modulation of the nonlinearity by adjusting the number of atoms is easier to implement and control .",

    "@xmath91 is decreased by @xmath69 while this behavior can not exist just in single cavity optomechanical system @xcite .",

    "the environment of the cavity fields can be treated as zero temperature while the mirror should be in thermal field .",
    "( a ) : the evolution of @xmath100 for initial state @xmath101 , with @xmath102 ( solid line ) and @xmath103 ( dashed line ) .",

    "the other parameters are the same with fig.2.,height=283 ]    now we first illustrate the existence of cross - kerr nonlinearity within the system . for simplicity ,",
    "we omit the pumping fields and the loss of the fields and assume that the oscillator is in its ground state . in fig.3a , @xmath108 is in coherent state @xmath109 @xmath110 , and the mode @xmath111 is initially in fock state @xmath112 .",
    "if the system contains the cross- kerr nonlinearity with the term @xmath113 , then we will have @xmath114 , the @xmath115 mode acquires a phase .",
    "when the phase equals to @xmath116 , a two - photon controlled - phase gate is naturally implemented , from which a cnot gate can also be easily constructed @xcite .",
    "performing quadrature operator @xmath117 measurement by the homodyne apparatus , we know @xmath118 . employing the hamiltonian @xmath119 , we plot @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 in fig.3 .",
    "we see that the photon number almost keeps unchanged but @xmath124 oscillates with cosine function .",
    "in addition , the frequency of cosine function increases with the increasing of @xmath83 ( see fig.3a ) , that is to say , the strength of the cross - kerr nonlinearity enhances with the increasing of @xmath83 . for both of the quasi - mode initially in coherent state",
    ", fig.3b shows that the periods of the oscillation of @xmath125 and @xmath123 have nothing to do with different initial coherent state , only the amplitudes are affected by the coherent states .",
    "although we plot the figure from @xmath126 , one can clearly see that cross - kerr nonlinearity do exist in the two - mode optomechanical system .     via detection of @xmath127 ( a ) where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and the qnd of phonon number @xmath130 via detection of @xmath127 ( b ) where @xmath131 , @xmath132=@xmath133 , @xmath134 . for both of the figures @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 ( dashed line ) , @xmath139 ( solid line ) , and",
    "the other parameters are the same with fig.2.,height=283 ]    we now discuss the qnd of photon and phonon number via detecting the photon number of @xmath115 . in fig.4a , initially there is a single photon in mode @xmath140 , @xmath115 is in vacuum state , and the phonon is in thermal state with @xmath141 . in order to perform qnd in mode @xmath111 , we need a weak classical driving field to compensate the loss of the cavity so as to keep the single photon , and we also need a little bit strong driving field to pump mode @xmath115 . because of the detection of mode @xmath115 , we have assumed that the loss of mode @xmath115 is larger than that of @xmath111 and phonon mode .",
    "for the case @xmath142 in the present parameter region , the above condition by assuming @xmath143 can be realized .",
    "fig.4a clearly shows us that after a period of time evolution , the photon number of mode @xmath115 and @xmath111 are equal , which means that the leaking - out photon number of mode @xmath115 is exactly equal to that of mode @xmath140 ; thus we can perform qnd of @xmath111 by detecting @xmath115 .",
    "if we want to detect phonon number , we need the phonon excitations which can be obtained by employing the thermal field .",
    "fig.4b displays that under appropriate condition , the qnd of phonon number also can be performed by detecting the same mode @xmath115 , where we assume that the mode @xmath115 and @xmath140 are both initially in vacuum state , the phonon mode is in thermal state with @xmath144 , and the mode @xmath111 is not driven under the condition @xmath145 . from fig.4 , we conclude that two initial independent bosonic modes finally acquire identical intensity after evolution , which is the so called synchronization . in addition , the number of atoms does affect the behavior of synchronization . for less number of atoms ,",
    "the time of evolution to achieve synchronization is longer than that with more atoms . comparing dashed line ( @xmath102 ) with solid line ( @xmath107 ) ,",
    "we can clearly observe it .",
    "thus , the number of atoms do modulate the nonlinearity .",
    "we can enhance the nonlinear strength by increasing the number of atoms in the present region of parameters . as we know",
    "that nonlinear interaction is necessary for the emergence of synchronization @xcite ; therefore , we can safely say that the cross - nonlinearity within the present scheme really can offer us qnd photon and phonon numbers .    during the review process of the paper",
    ", we read the related works brkj , lemonde .",
    "for strongly driven optomechanical system , they included the nonlinear interaction term usually omitted by most works and shown that intrinsic nonlinear are observable even with a relatively weak optomechanical coupling .",
    "different from @xcite , we discuss the weakly driven and weak coupling condition , we do not employ the so called linearized optomechanics .",
    "most importantly , we put forward an alternatively scheme to enhance the cross - kerr nonlinearity via atomic coherence .",
    "we put forward a scheme employing atomic coherence to enhance the nonlinearity of optomechanical system . when the atoms interact with the two mode fields with large detuning condition , we adiabatically eliminated the degree of atoms . for weak coupling among the two mode fields and the mechanical resonator , we derived the effective hamiltonian and shown that the nonlinear coefficients can be enhanced by increasing the number of atoms at certain range of parameters .",
    "we also numerically studied the nonlinearity enhancement beyond the effective hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the potential quantum nondemolition measurement of bosonic mode .",
    "our results show that the present system exhibits synchronization , and the nonlinear effects provide us a means in performing qnd .    as to the realizability in experiment",
    ", we do not demand the strong coupling of atoms with the cavity , for example , our parameters satisfy @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "we also do not require strong coupling between the cavity fields and the mechanical resonator , and one can easily check that the so called strong coupling condition @xmath148 is not meet .",
    "although the above strong coupling conditions are achievable , the loosening of the coupling conditions is more realizable and is still valuable .",
