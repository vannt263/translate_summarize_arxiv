    "the formulation of the problem of dimer coverings goes back to the thirties  @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial problem of finding the exact number of such coverings has been solved in the early sixties for planar 2d lattices by means of pfaffian techniques  @xcite , which have been extended to calculate dimer - dimer and monomer ( i.e. unpaired sites)-monomer correlation functions  @xcite . notwithstanding",

    "dimer coverings of bipartite graphs in three dimensions have also been recently shown to be connected to gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "dimer models have also recently regained interest because quantum dimer models ( qdm ) , originally introduced by rokhsar and kivelson  @xcite , are among the simplest systems which exhibit ground - states with topological order and fractionalization  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study a model of _ interacting _ classical dimers on the square lattice , with an interaction that favors dimer alignment .",
    "the dimer coverings are close - packed , _",

    "the cg description implies that the introduction of monomers is a marginal perturbation at the kt point and hence leads to the emergence of another critical line .",

    "our numerical methods consist in mc simulations and exact diagonalization of the tm .",
    "we now describe these two methods in turn .",
    "we use a mc directed - loop ( or directed-``worm '' ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this method allows to make non - local moves in the dimer configurations by changing the positions of dimers along a closed loop , which can be quite large .",
    "this results in small autocorrelation times in the mc process , and permits to treat large systems ( up to @xmath147 in this study ) .",
    "moreover , the directed - loop algorithm captures the physics of test defects ( monomers ) in the dimer configuration as we discuss below .",
    "the algorithm indeed allows to calculate monomer - monomer correlation function ; conversely , this indicates that the performance of the algorithm is dictated by the physical properties of test monomers in the different physical phases .    for sake of completeness",
    ", we briefly describe below the algorithm following ref .   and specifying minor details where our specific implementation differs .",
    "one mc sweep of the algorithm consists of the three following steps :    * the worm , which can be seen as constituted by two monomers ( head and tail ) , is initially placed on top of a dimer configuration at a random site @xmath148 .",
    "* the site @xmath35 is connected to a neighboring site @xmath149 by a dimer in the background configuration ( this dimer is noted @xmath150 ) . the head of the worm is moved to @xmath149 and the dimer ( @xmath35,@xmath149 ) is removed , leaving the site @xmath149 with no dimer attached to it . out of the four neighbors of @xmath149 , one ( which we call @xmath151 )",
    "is selected according to a local detailed balance rule ( see below ) .",
    "a dimer is put between @xmath149 and @xmath151 . * if @xmath152 , the worm is finished and we are left with a new valid dimer configuration .",
    "otherwise , we rename @xmath153 and go back to step 2 .",
    "how does the worm , sitting at site @xmath149 ( and coming from site @xmath35 ) , choose the site @xmath151 where a dimer will be put in step 2 ? for this , we consider the _ weights _",
    "@xmath154 ( respectively @xmath155 ) contributed to the partition function by a dimer located between sites @xmath35 and @xmath149 ( respectively @xmath149 and @xmath151 ) . in the model of ref .",
    ", each dimer is given a certain fugacity and thus contributes solely a certain weight to the partition function . in our model ,",
    "the weight of a dimer @xmath150 is given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the number of nearest neighbors parallel to the dimer @xmath150 .",
    "once these weights are known , the probability @xmath158 to select a given site @xmath151 is imposed to satisfy a local detailed balance rule :    @xmath159    this leads to a set of equations ( `` directed - loop '' equations  @xcite ) corresponding to all the possibles values of local dimer configurations and the corresponding numbers @xmath160 .",
    "these equations are underdetermined , and we impose by experience  @xcite to minimize the bounce processes @xmath161 , _",
    "i.e. _ the case where the site @xmath151 is chosen to be the origin site @xmath35 ( the worm backtracks in its own path , which is _ a priori _ quite useless ) . for the specific model of ref .  , a solution minimizing the bounce probabilities and satisfying the local detailed balance equation was found analytically .",
    "more generally , such a solution can always be found numerically with linear programming techniques  @xcite .",
    "please note that at @xmath24 , the worm simply performs a random walk in the dimer configuration ( more precisely , all the even steps in the walk are purely random , the odd ones are dictated by the underlying dimer configuration ) .",
    "taking a snapshot of the configuration during the worm construction shows that two test monomers have been inserted in the dimer configuration , and thus connect the behavior of the worm to the monomer correlation function . the fact that the worm walk is _ locally _ detailed balance actually imposes the histogram of the distance @xmath162 between the worm s head and tail to be proportional ( up to a small correction factor ) to the monomer - monomer correlation function @xmath163 ( see precise definition in sec .",
    "[ sec : hight ] ) .",
    "the proof of this statement can be worked out along the lines of ref .  .",
    "the only subtlety is the following : the measurement of the correlation function is made at step 2 , before the selection of the next site @xmath151 . since all the future dimer positions @xmath164 are not equivalent ( they will contribute differently to the partition function ) and since the next dimer position is not yet decided , we have to correct the monomer - monomer correlation estimator by the inverse of the total weight contributed by all possible future positions , _ i.e. _ we increment the estimator of @xmath163 ( with @xmath162 the position difference vector between sites @xmath165 and @xmath149 ) by @xmath166 where @xmath167 . if all future position dimers are equivalent ( as in the model of ref .  ) , this factor is constant , and we can just simply identify the histogram of the distance @xmath162 between the worm s head and tail to @xmath163 .",
    "the worm algorithm therefore possesses the nice feature of being able to calculate @xmath163 , _ even if monomers are not allowed in the model_. this also indicates that the worm algorithm performances is bound to follow the physics of monomers : if the monomers are confined , the worms will be short , resulting in a merely local algorithm - which is known to display poor performances ( for example ergodicity problems ) .",
    "if the monomers are deconfined , worms will be long and will update a massive number of dimers - resulting in small autocorrelation times .",
    "the technical details of the mc calculations are as follows : simulations were performed on @xmath168 samples , up to @xmath169 for the full @xmath3 range , and up to @xmath170 for correlation functions for a few chosen temperatures .",
    "pbc are assumed .",
    "each mc sweep is constituted by a number of worms such that all the links of the lattice are visited once on average by a worm .",

    "<S> we give a theoretical interpretation of these results by mapping the model to a coulomb gas , whose coupling constant and associated exponents are calculated numerically with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> introducing monomers is a marginal perturbation at the kosterlitz - thouless transition and gives rise to another critical line . </S>",
    "<S> we study this line numerically , showing that it is in the ashkin - teller universality class , and terminates in a tricritical point at finite temperature and monomer fugacity . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of this work , we also derive analytic results relevant to the non - interacting case of dimer coverings , including a bethe ansatz ( at the free fermion point ) analysis , a detailed discussion of the effective height model and a free field analysis of height fluctuations . </S>"
