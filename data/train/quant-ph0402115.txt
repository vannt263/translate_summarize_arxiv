    "there exists a well - established and close analogy between classical optics and wave mechanics . indeed , the paraxial approximation of the helmholtz wave equation leads @xcite to a schrdinger equation . in the present article",
    "we argue that there might be another intimate relation between quantum mechanics and wave optics .",
    "the agents of this proposed connection are wigner s phase space distribution function @xcite and fresnel optics @xcite .",
    "the wigner function @xcite allows a formulation of quantum mechanics , which displays a close resemblance to classical statistical mechanics .",
    "it also provides the quantum mechanical probability distributions of variables such as position and momentum as marginals .",
    "moreover , the radon transform @xcite expresses the wigner function in terms of measurable rotated quadrature distributions , that is of a continuous set of tomographic cuts through the wigner function .",
    "it is in this context that we recall that the wavefunction in rotated quadrature variables is related @xcite to the wavefunction in the original variable by a fresnel transform .",
    "this fact is the first hint for a connection between the wigner function and fresnel optics @xcite .",
    "however , we suspect that there must be even closer ties between these topics .",
    "we present arguments supporting this conjecture but have to admit that we still lack a rigorous proof",
    ".    nevertheless , we offer these ideas as a tribute to our long term friend frank moss on the occasion of his 70^th^ birthday . from the creation of quantum vortices by a moving object in superfluid @xmath0 @xcite via noise in complex systems @xcite to neuro dynamics",
    "@xcite frank has covered many topics in physics .",
    "he has made many path breaking discoveries and has always been open to new ideas .",
    "it is only for this reason that we have the courage to propose an idea that has not been developed to its fullest extent .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly summarize the essential features of wigner s phase space distribution . here",
    "we emphasize a crucial property that expresses the value of the wigner function at a given point in phase space as an alternating sum of the energy statistics .",
    "an analogous relation exists in fresnel optics . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we review a representation of the field in the fresnel approximation as an alternating sum of inclination factors .",
    "we dedicate sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] to compare and contrast the two phenomena and elaborate on a possible connection between them .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in classical mechanics the state of a system and its future is completely determined when we specify its initial position _ and _ momentum .",
    "hence , a single point in phase space suffices to characterize a classical system .",
    "in contrast , the uncertainty principle prevents such a description of a quantum system . according to max planck",
    "a quantum state takes up at least an area of @xmath1 and the internal structure of the state follows from a quantum mechanical phase space distribution .",
    "there is an infinite number @xcite of such distributions .",
    "this feature is closely related to the question of operator ordering in quantum mechanics .",
    "all quantum mechanical distribution functions contain the same amount of information but bring out different features of quantum mechanics .",
    "a rather popular phase space function is the one @xcite proposed by eugene paul wigner in 1932 in order to understand quantum corrections to a thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to note that it already appeared earlier in papers by paul adrian maurice dirac @xcite and werner heisenberg @xcite on the thomas - fermi atom and on x - ray scattering from crystals , respectively .",
    "the recent years have seen a renaissance of the wigner function . in particular ,",
    "the field of quantum optics has profited immensely from the wigner function since it brings out most clearly the superposition principle in quantum mechanics . moreover ,",
    "wigner functions of quantum states have been reconstructed @xcite for various quantum systems , such as a single mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity , an ion stored in a paul trap , and a rydberg electron .",
    "the wigner function @xmath2 of a density operator @xmath3 follows from the fourier integral @xcite@xmath4 of the matrix elements @xmath5 of the density operator in position representation and @xmath6 denotes the conjugate variable of position @xmath7 .    for the case of a harmonic oscillator",
    "the wigner function at a phase space point @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the characteristic length scale of the oscillator , can be expressed as the alternating sum @xcite@xmath10 in this formula the energy distribution @xmath11 of the displaced quantum state @xmath3 enters . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the energy eigenstates and the displacement operator , respectively .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that the relation eq .",
    "( [ w_alpha ] ) holds true even for arbitrary but symmetric binding potentials .",
    "the representation eq .  ( [ w_alpha ] ) of the wigner function as an alternating sum has served as an extremely useful tool to reconstruct @xcite this phase space function .",
    "it is also the starting point of our expedition to fresnel optics .    in the top of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a spherical wavefront of radius @xmath14 and wavenumber @xmath15 that has originated from a source at @xmath16 . at a unit distance from the source its amplitude is @xmath17 . what is the strength of this wave at a given point @xmath18 appropriately away from the source ?    the huygens - fresnel principle expresses the strength @xmath19 of the wave as the integral @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the surface element at the point @xmath22 on the spherical wavefront and @xmath23 is the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "the integration extends over the surface of the spherical wave .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is an inclination factor and @xmath25 is the diffraction angle , that is , the angle between the normal at @xmath22 and the direction of the connection between @xmath22 and @xmath18 .    at this stage of the argument we can not recognize any relation between the wigner phase space function , eq .",
    "( [ wigner_def ] ) , and fresnel optics , eq .  ( [ u_def ] )",
    ". however , the geometrical representation of the huygens - fresnel integral , that is , the construction @xcite of the familiar fresnel zones provides the crucial clue .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we start from a sphere around @xmath18 with a radius equal to the distance between @xmath18 and the point where the spherical wave @xmath26 cuts through the line connecting @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "we add another sphere  now with a radius which is increased by half a wavelength  and continue this procedure of slicing the spherical wavefront into many layers . the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a two - dimensional cut through @xmath26 .",
    "the total strength at the point @xmath18 is then equal to the alternating sum @xcite@xmath27 where @xmath28 is a factor and _ @xmath29 _ is the inclination factor evaluated at the angle @xmath30 appearing at the crossing of the @xmath31-th circle with the spherical wave .",
    "the similarity of the expressions for the wigner function in terms of the energy distribution , eq .",
    "( [ w_alpha ] ) , and the strength of a fresnel wave in terms of inclination factors , eq .",
    "( [ psip ] ) , is astonishing .",
    "but maybe it is nothing more than a formal mathematical coincidence .",
    "immediately three reasons why we are tempted to agree with this evaluation of the situation offer themselves : ( i ) there does not seem to be an analogue to the fresnel zones in phase space .",
    "( ii ) the wigner function lives in phase space whereas the fresnel zones appear in real space .",
    "( iii ) there does not seem to be a general argument that explains why fresnel optics is preferred over other limits of optics .    in the next sections we address these objections one by one . in this process",
    "we will utilize one crucial tool , namely the semi - classical limit of quantum mechanics .",
    "it brings to light fresnel zones in phase space , connects phase space with real space and , most importantly , singles out fresnel optics from other limits of optics .",
    "we start by showing that a picture reminiscent of fresnel zones emerges in phase space .",
    "moreover , we give a geometrical meaning to the energy distribution @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ w_alpha ] ) .",
    "the concept of area of overlap in phase space @xcite is the bridge between the two apparently disconnected fields of fresnel optics and phase space .",
    "indeed , the rigorous approach is the wigner function .",
    "it allows us to represent @xcite the scalar product of two quantum states as the overlap in phase space .    however , a much more elementary algorithm springs from the picture of an energy eigenstate as a band @xcite in bohr - sommerfeld phase space . in this formalism",
    "the edges of the @xmath31-th band are determined by the familiar bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition @xmath33    for the case of a harmonic oscillator the edges of the @xmath31-th circular bohr - sommerfeld band are proportional to @xmath34 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this way",
    "we discover a picture that is reminiscent of the fresnel zones of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in this formalism",
    "the energy distribution @xmath35 of an arbitrary state is the overlap between the state represented appropriately in phase space and the bohr - sommerfeld bands .",
    "for the example of a coherent state , that is , a displaced ground state , it is thus given @xcite by the overlap of a circle representing the coherent state with these bands as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_overlap ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite already mentions briefly a connection to fresnel optics .",
    "hence , we can interpret the energy distribution in the definition eq .",
    "( [ w_alpha ] ) of the wigner function as the overlap in phase space between circular bands and a displaced state in the spirit of the fresnel zone construction .",
    "still , there seems to be an immediate contradiction between this phase space approach and the fresnel picture .",
    "indeed , the radii of the fresnel spheres increase linearly with @xmath31 whereas the edges of the bohr - sommerfeld bands increase only as the square root of @xmath31 .",
    "fortunately , here we focus on the wrong comparison . instead of concentrating on the radius of the sphere we should rather consider the radius of the fresnel zone . as indicated in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] this radius is the distance from the crossing point between the fresnel sphere and the wavefront @xmath26 to the point on the line @xmath36 .",
    "it increases with the square root of @xmath31 .",
    "thus the fresnel zones enjoy the same scaling law as bohr - sommerfeld bands .",
    "finally , there is still the lingering question of different spaces .",
    "the wigner function lives in phase space whereas fresnel optics acts in real space . to resolve this apparent contradiction we have to draw on another analogy : the vector model of angular momentum .",
    "we can represent the quantum state of an angular momentum of total value @xmath37 as a domain on a sphere of radius @xmath38 .",
    "states of a well - defined @xmath39-component of @xmath40 play a prominent role . in this case the domains on the sphere are @xmath41 belts as shown on the top of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . an angular - momentum vector with the @xmath39-component @xmath42 can be found anywhere in the @xmath43-th belt .",
    "a more sophisticated approach defines the wigner function of an angular - momentum state @xcite . in complete analogy to the wigner function eq .",
    "( [ wigner_def ] ) in position and momentum we can again associate positive and negative values with every point on the angular - momentum sphere .",
    "we emphasize that this picture of an angular momentum is still in real space .",
    "so where is phase space ?",
    "phase space for an angular momentum is real space ! moreover , in the limit of large positive values of @xmath37 we can relate angular - momentum phase space to that of the harmonic oscillator by making use of the stereographic projection @xcite shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this way we project the wigner function wrapped around the sphere onto a plane .",
    "we find the familiar wigner function of an energy eigenstate of a harmonic oscillator . from phase space of angular momentum living in real space",
    "we have gone to the phase space of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "`` never do a calculation unless you know the answer . ''",
    "this advice has always been and still is one of john archibald wheeler s first moral principles in science . in the case of wigner versus fresnel",
    "we have been good students of wheeler .",
    "indeed , we have an answer .",
    "moreover , we have many indications for the correctness of our hypothesis .",
    "we have presented the evidence : alternating sums define the wigner function as well as the strength of a fresnel wave .",
    "the quantities that enter the sums result from similar geometrical constructions .",
    "they even scale similarly .",
    "one final and rather general argument in favor of fresnel optics comes to our mind .",
    "again wheeler is our witness .",
    "as he points out @xcite fresnel optics and its quadratic phase factors giving rise to the cornu spiral play a crucial role in feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .    despite the wealth of arguments the calculation is still missing and",
    "may serve as an opportunity for a new collaboration with the birthday boy .",
    "happy birthday , frank !",
