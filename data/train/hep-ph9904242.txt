    "the only limits so far obtained for @xmath4 and @xmath8 are derived from analyses of the partial widths for @xmath9 , for @xmath10  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider for the first time the effects of anomalous charged current dipole moments on tau decays involving hadrons .",
    "we analyse the @xmath0 process which has largest branching fraction of all the tau decay modes .",
    "this process is particularly topical due to a recently reported difference of @xmath11 between the measured @xmath0 branching fraction and the ( lower ) value predicted using @xmath12 data in the neighbourhood of the @xmath13 meson resonances and the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis  @xcite . while this could be attributed to a fluctuation , we note that non - zero values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 would also yield a higher measured value for @xmath14 .",
    "we present predictions for the differential @xmath0 decay distributions and the partial width , @xmath15 , as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "typical errors are @xmath93 which is degraded compared to the full multi - dimensional fit but is still statistically more sensitive than the combined e and @xmath86 channels .",
    "the apparent disadvantage of the leptonic channels is , however , mitigated by the need to know @xmath32 for the @xmath0 channel which has a non - negligible systematic error , as discussed below .    in this paper",
    "we can not derive constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 from fits to the differential decay distributions due to a lack of the necessary experimental information .",
    "we can , however , determine constraints from the ( intrinsically less sensitive ) measurements of @xmath14 , as described below .",

[ brcvc ] ) , a systematic error of @xmath99% for radiative corrections not included in @xmath100  @xcite , and a systematic error of 0.3% for the effect of @xmath96 interference  @xcite .",

    "we constrain @xmath4 and @xmath50 to the ranges : @xmath103 these results are slightly more than two standard deviations from the sm expectations of zero which , though intriguing , can not be considered statistically compelling evidence of new physics .    the results may be compared to complementary results previously obtained from purely leptonic tau decays  @xcite , which are @xmath104 and @xmath105 or @xmath106 and @xmath107 at the 95% c.l .  @xcite .",
    "these are more restrictive than those we obtain from @xmath0 decays .",
    "this is partly due to the larger uncertainties in the theoretical and experimental values of the @xmath0 branching fractions . in principle",
    "these effects could be counteracted by a higher intrinsic sensitivity of the @xmath0 channel due to larger values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 relative to the leptonic modes . from our calculations , however , we see in retrospect that the numerical values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are smaller than their leptonic counterparts ( 0.5 and 0.1 respectively ) . therefore , if only the total rate information is used the @xmath0 channel is less sensitive than the leptonic channels , in contrast to the higher statistical sensitivity of the @xmath0 channel when the differential decay distribution is analysed .",

    "this constitutes the first such analysis of a hadronic tau decay mode .",
    "the analysis of the differential distributions for the @xmath0 decay mode is found to be statistically more sensitive than the corresponding analysis of purely leptonic modes , @xmath82 , irrespective of the tau polarisation .",
    "the branching fraction , @xmath14 , is also sensitive to @xmath4 and @xmath50 although less so than for the leptonic branching fractions .",
    "by comparison of the measured value of @xmath14 with the predictions of cvc , we determine @xmath108 and @xmath109 . which differ from the sm expectations by approximately two standard deviations .",
    "the values for @xmath4 and @xmath50 obtained from @xmath110 are consistent with zero .",
    "this could mean that the measured result for @xmath14 and cvc differ only due to a fluctuation , or that there is a theoretical or experimental uncertainty which is not correctly taken into account .",
    "the new @xmath12 data in the neighbourhood of the @xmath13 meson resonances should reduce the experimental uncertainty in the cvc prediction by a factor of almost two in 1999  @xcite . hopefully these data will clarify whether this is a statistical or systematic effect or the first indication of some new physics which affects hadronic tau decays but not purely leptonic decays .",
