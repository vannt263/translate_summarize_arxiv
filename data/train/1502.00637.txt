    "1999 ; faucher - gigure et  al .",

    "reliable values require direct measurements of lyc fluxes from a statistically significant sample ( @xmath251 ) of starburst galaxies to constrain the low escape fractions expected from a highly directional lyc escape geometry .",
    "for example , if theoretical models predict @xmath252 , with 5% of the lyc escaping from each side of a gaseous disk through perpendicular conical chimneys ( dove & shull 1994 ) , direct detections would be possible , on average , in only 5% of the observations .",

    "1 .   compared to ` enzo ` n - body hydrodynamical simulations of the low-@xmath17 igm with different values of the ionizing uv background , the observed distribution of ly@xmath2  forest absorbers ( @xmath258 ) lies intermediate between the hm01 and hm12 background calculations .",
    "a fit to the observations requires a factor - of - two increase in the uvb above hm12 with a recommended hydrogen ionization rate @xmath259 .",
    "2 .   the one - sided ionizing photon flux @xmath8  @xmath9  s@xmath10 at @xmath11 agrees with the observed igm metal ionization ratios , /  and /   ( shull et  al .  2014 ) , and suggests a 2530% contribution of ly@xmath2  absorbers to the cosmic baryon inventory .",
    "the increased ionizing background probably requires an increase in the escape fraction of ionizing ( lyc ) radiation from starburst galaxies above the low values ( @xmath46 ) adopted by hm12 .",
    "ionizing photons from galaxies with @xmath252 gives results consistent with previous uvb modeling ( shull et  al .",
    "1999 ) that found similar contributions from agn and starburst galaxies , with specific intensities ( erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10  hz@xmath10  sr@xmath10 ) at 13.6 ev of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "4 .   because lyc propagation through the ism is expected to be highly directional , detections of escaping photons depend on galaxy orientation and will require large surveys to obtain valid statistical inferences .",
    "future observational and theoretical work could significantly improve our characterization of the ionizing uvb at @xmath260 .",
    "we need better accuracy of the column - density distribution of ly@xmath2  absorbers at @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
