    "there are many unification models that try to combine the strong and electroweak interactions into a simple group .",
    "the simplest model is based on su(5 ) gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the minimal su(5 ) model predicts the good mass relation for the third generation ( i.e. @xmath5 ) at gut scale .",
    "however , it has a bad prediction for mass relations for the first and second generations ( i.e. @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) at gut scale .",
    "in addition , it does not naturally accommodate the right handed neutrino . on the other hand",
    ", the so(10 ) model accommodates all chiral fermions of one standard model generation plus a right handed neutrino within a 16-dimensional irreducible representation ( irrep . ) . also , minimal so(10 ) with only @xmath8 leads to the up quark mass matrix being proportional to the down quark mass matrix , so it is considered a good zeroth order approximation for ckm mixings . some models based on so(10 ) symmetry without including any family symmetry were proposed to explain most of the features of quarks and leptons @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , one is not really fully satisfied with only producing the fermion masses and mixing angles without explaining why we have three generations and without understanding the relation among generations , such as hierarchy and mixing angles .",
    "for example , the flavor symmetry @xmath2 @xcite@xcite can be employed to explain why the observed neutrino mixing matrix is in very good agreement with the so called tri - bi - maximal(tbm ) mixing structure @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be important to consider the underlying family symmetry .",
    "one of the best candidates for flavor symmetry is the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath2 , for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , it is the smallest group that has a 3-dimensional irrep .",
    "secondly , susy - so(10)@xmath9 @xmath2 symmetry solves fcnc problem since the scalar fermions , which belong to the 16-irrep of so(10 ) and transform as a triplet under @xmath2 , have degenerate masses .",
    "finally , it was shown that the tbm mixing structure can be obtained by imposing @xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "few models based on the so(10 ) @xmath9 @xmath2 group have been studied @xcite@xcite . in these models ,",
    "large higgs representations have been employed .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite , the authors employed a ( @xmath10,3 ) representation , where the first ( second ) entry indicates the transformation under so(10 ) ( @xmath2 ) , in order to produce the fermion masses and mixing angles for both normal and inverted neutrino mass spectra .",
    "besides employing the large higgs representation @xmath10 , the models in ref.@xcite contain more than one adjoint @xmath11 representation .",
    "it has been shown that only one adjoint higgs field is required to break so(10 ) while preserving the gauge coupling unification @xcite . also , using quite large higgs representation like @xmath10 leads to the unified gauge coupling being non - perturbative before the planck scale , which might be hard to obtain from superstring theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to construct so(10 ) @xmath9 @xmath2 model in which so(10 ) is broken to the standard model ( sm ) group in the minimal breaking scheme .",
    "this means using only a spinor - antispinor ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) to break the rank of so(10 ) from five to four , and the right handed neutrino gets a heavy mass from the antispinor higgs field ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "then one adjoint representation @xmath11 is used to break the group all the way to the sm group .",
    "recently , a numerical analysis for quark and charged lepton masses and mixings based on non - supersymmetric so(10 ) without flavor symmetry was done @xcite .",
    "the authors did not include the neutrino sector in the numirical fitting .",
    "their result for atmospheric angle was @xmath14 .",
    "however , as this paper shows , when the neutrino sector is included , the result is not only a better fit for atmospheric angle @xmath15 , but also the known light neutrino mass differences are accommodated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a general structure of the fermion mass matrices for the second and third generations is constructed .",
    "then , based on that structure , the fermion mass hierarchy and relations are explained . in section 3 , it is shown that introducing several 10-plets of matter fields to the model leads to the doubly lopsided structure which produces large neutrino mixing angles and small quark mixing angles simultaneously @xcite .",
    "then , some analytical expressions for quark masses and mixing angles at gut scale are derived in a certain approximation to the model parameters . in section 4 , exact numerical analysis",
    "is done to find the outputs at gut scale . to get predictions of fermion masses and mixings at low scale , the quark masses and mixing at gut scale will be run to the low scale by using renomalization equations . in section 5 , it is shown how to get a suitable right - handed neutrino mass structure that gives the correct fitting for atmospheric angle after combining the charged lepton contribution .",
    "section 6 is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , the renormalizable yukawa couplings of the sm fermions with the extra spinor - antispinor matter fields are considered as a concrete example of the model .",
    "the known matter fields of the sm ( quarks and leptons ) plus the right handed neutrino are contained in the three spinors ( @xmath16,3 ) , where @xmath17 stands for flavor index .",
    "the ordinary fermions , @xmath16 , do not couple with @xmath11 in the minimal so(10 ) . as a result , some of the predictions of minimal so(10 ) such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 will follow , which are badly broken in nature . therefore , extra heavy fermion fields must be introduced in order to allow the @xmath11 to couple directly with the quarks and leptons of the standard model .",
    "the transformation of the ordinary fermions and the extra matter fields under @xmath2 and the additional symmetry @xmath20 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "let us consider first the invariant superpotential @xmath21 under the assigned symmetry that contains the coupling of ordinary fermions with the spinor - antispinor matter fields .",
    "@xmath22 table 2 summarizes the transformation of the higgs fields needed to achieve a minimum breaking scheme and the higgs singlets needed to break @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "although in this model , the structure in eq.1 does not include the yukawa term @xmath23 which is forbidden by the discrete symmetry @xmath24 , the ordinary standard model fermions get their masses through their coupling with heavy extra fields .",
    "this is similar to how the light neutrinos get their masses through the coupling with the heavy right handed neutrinos in the known see - saw mechanism .",
    "the coupling terms in the superpotential @xmath21 can be represented diagrammatically as shown in fig.1 . after integrating out the heavy states ,",
    "the approximate effective operators can be read from the diagram . @xmath25",
    "the vevs of higgs fields can be written down in general form as : @xmath26 here the notation @xmath27 refers to a @xmath28 of su(5 ) contained in a @xmath29 of so(10 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 from eq.3 is a linear combination of so(10 ) generators .",
    "one can redefine , without loss of generality , the light fermion states as :    .the transformation of the matter fields under so(10)@xmath9@xmath2 and @xmath24 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to compare with experiment , the predicted fermion masses and mixing angles at the low energy scale are needed to be found .",
    "the above numerical values of the fermion masses and mixing angles which are obtained at gut scale have been evolved to the low scale in two steps .",
    "first , the running from gut scale to @xmath31 is done by using the 2-loop mssm beta function .",
    "the running factors denoted by @xmath32 depend on the value of @xmath33 .",
    "the known fermion masses and mixing data are best fitted with @xmath34=10 $ ] . the running factors for @xmath34=10",

    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the relevant renormalization equations can be found in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the results are ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath40=@xmath39)=(0.4456 , 0.5309 , 0.8188 , 0.83606 , 0.8454 , 0.98833 , 1.0151 ) .    by using the above renormalization factors , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , the following predictions at low scale can be obtained : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "note that the numerical value of @xmath67 is not in agreement with the experimental value @xmath68 @xcite . in order to fix this , the finite gluino and chargino loop corrections @xcite are required to be included to the down type quark masses ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath67 ) , which are denoted respectively by ( 1+@xmath71 ) , ( 1+@xmath72 ) , ( 1+@xmath73 ) .",
    "these corrections are proportional to the supersymmetric particle spectrum : @xmath74+\\frac{\\lambda^2_t}{16\\pi^2}\\frac{\\mu a_t}{m^2_{\\tilde t_l}-m^2_{\\tilde t_r}}[f(m^2_{\\tilde t_l}/\\mu ^2)-f(m^2_{\\tilde t_r}/\\mu^2 ) ] ) $ ] , where @xmath75 and the first ( second ) term refers to gluino ( chargino ) correction .",
    "similar expressions exist for @xmath72 and @xmath71 , but without the chargino contribution and @xmath76 .",
    "if the chargino loop corrections are negligible and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are degenerate , the equality relation @xmath80 is approximately satisfied . in order to get better fitting for down type quark masses ,",
    "let us take @xmath81 which gives @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . the comparison of the model predictions and experimental data at low scale is summarized in table 3 , where the quark and charged lepton masses , the ckm mixing angles ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , the neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , and the cp violation parameter ( @xmath91 ) are taken from @xcite .",
    "the masses are all in gev . although the model here predicts @xmath92 , the quantity @xmath93 is considered in table 3 , where it is assumed that the tiny up quark mass at gut scale may be generated either by including the coupling @xmath94 into the model or by considering higher dimensional operators .",
    "suppose @xmath95 , the model predictions of the quantities @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which are well - known from lattice calculation @xcite , are given in table 3 .",
    "the asterisks in table 3 indicate that the model predictions of neutrino mixing angles are obtained after including the neutrino sector in section 5 .",
    "up to now , the model gives excellent agreement with the known values for the ckm mixings , the quark masses , the charged lepton masses , cp violation parameter , and the neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath98 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "however , the whole picture is still not complete and the following question arises .",
    "what is the appropriate light neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath99 ) that gives not only the correct contribution to the atmospheric angle , but also the correct neutrino mass differences : @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xcite ? in the other words , we are looking for a suitable structure of right handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 since @xmath103 is fixed . recall that mns mixing matrix is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the unitary matrices needed to diagonalize the hermitian lepton matrix @xmath107 and the light neutrino matrix @xmath108 respectively .",
    "@xmath109 where @xmath108 is assumed to be real and symmetric .",
    "the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath103 in eq.23 has vanishing first row and column and the same is true for @xmath108 .",
    "so the matrix required to diagonalize @xmath108 is simply a rotation in the 2 - 3 plane by an angle @xmath110 while @xmath111 is determined numerically from the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "thus , the mixing matrix of neutrinos is given by    @xmath112    one can conclude the correct contribution of the neutrino sector to the atmospheric angle is around @xmath110=@xmath113 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath110=@xmath113 the neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath89 , @xmath88 , @xmath98 ) become ( 0.707 , 0.53 , 0.21 ) . in order to find the suitable right handed neutrino mass structure",
    ", one can easily prove the inverse of the see - saw relation .",
    "@xmath114 a similar technique was used in ref @xcite .",
    "note that one of the eigenvalues of @xmath108 is zero ( i.e. @xmath115 is singular ) , so the inverse of @xmath115 does not exist . to overcome this problem",
    ", one can generally define @xmath115=diag ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) and @xmath116 will not appear in @xmath102 . by using the numerical result of @xmath103 , @xmath110=@xmath113 , and @xmath117/@xmath118=0.178 ,",
    "the right handed mass structure can be presented numerically .",
    "@xmath119 from the above numerical mass matrix , one concludes @xmath120 , so to a good approximation , the above numerical structure can be represented analytically as follows : @xmath121 the constant @xmath122 should not be equal to one because then @xmath102 would be singular , but the constant @xmath122 should be around 1 .",
    "now our mission is to find the yukawa couplings that respect the symmetry of the model and lead to an analytical structure similar to eq.32 .",
    "this can be accomplished by considering the following yukawa couplings represented by feynmann diagram in fig.4 .",
    "@xmath123 where two fermion singlets @xmath124 and @xmath125 which couple with the singlet higgs @xmath126 have been introduced ( their transformation under so(10)@xmath9@xmath2 and the additional symmetry are shown in tables 1 and 2 ) . the singlet transformation of the product of three triplet under @xmath2 of the second term of eq .",
    "33 is given by @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 are the vev s components of @xmath126 . by assuming @xmath131=@xmath132",
    ", fig.4 leads to the desired right handed neutrino mass structure .",
    "@xmath133 by comparing the 2 - 3 block of the above structure with the mass structure in eq .",
    "32 , one can see the constant @xmath122 is equivalent to the quantity ( @xmath134 ) which is equal to one in the limit @xmath135 .",
    "so , let us expand the eigenvalues of the right handed neutrino mass structure in eq.34 around @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath136 one can see two of the right handed neutrino masses are approximately degenerate for small values of @xmath128 ( i.e. @xmath137 ) . by setting ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath138)=(@xmath139 , 0.125 , 0.994 , @xmath140 ) , the numerical fit for the neutrino mixing angles , the light neutrino masses and right handed neutrino masses are obtained as follows : @xmath141",
    "both largeness of neutrino mixing angles and the smallness of ckm mixing angles can be accounted for by a lopsided structure of the charged leptons and down quarks .",
    "this structure was obtained in several studies and has been used for many models of fermion masses .",
    "the model that has been studied here is the first susy grand unification model based on the gauge symmetry so(10 ) with the discrete family symmetry @xmath2 that leads to the doubly lopsided structure . a few works on so(10 )",
    "@xmath0 have recently been published , but what makes this work unique is the assumption of using the minimal set of higgs fields that break so(10 ) to the sm group .",
    "this assumption acts as an important guide for searching for good models .",
    "the possibilities of renormalizable yukawa interactions for quarks and leptons are very limited because the minimum higgs breaking scheme is imposed and the superpotential must respect the assigned symmetry of the model .",
    "based on that , a general mass structure for the heavy generations has been obtained which explains the following features : ( 1 ) @xmath142 , ( 2 ) @xmath143 , ( 3 ) @xmath144 .",
    "it is important to mention that another work @xcite got the same mass structure for heavy fermions . in that work",
    ", the authors did not employ the flavor symmetry and showed that the hierarchy between the second and third generations can be understood by choosing the specific direction of @xmath145 .",
    "also , they employed another adjoint higgs field @xmath145 to include the first family to their model . on the other hand , in this presented study , the above features of heavy fermions have been obtained by picking specific direction of @xmath145 , but the hierarchy between the three generations can be understood in the framework of @xmath2-symmetry . without adding another adjoint to the model , the first family is successfully included to the model and excellent predictions are obtained .    for fitting purposes , some approximate analytical expressions given in eq .",
    "26 are derived for mass ratios and mixing angles of the quarks and the leptons by combining the yukawa couplings represented by three feynman diagrams in figures 1 - 3 .",
    "however , exact numerical fitting at low scale was done . without including the neutrino sector , the model predictions at low scale for the masses and the mixing angles ( except the atmospheric angle ) of the quarks and the charged leptons , as well as cp violation parameter are in excellent agreement with data ( i.e. within 2@xmath146 ) .",
    "the atmospheric angle needes to be corrected by considering the neutrino sector .",
    "the symmetry of the model succeeds to produce the appropriate right handed neutrino structure that gives not only the correct contribution to the atmospheric angle , but also the correct neutrino mass differences .",
    "the neutrino contribution to the solar angel is negligible . besides , after combining the two contributions ( neutrinos and charged leptons contributions ) the neutrino mixing angle @xmath147 is predicted .",
