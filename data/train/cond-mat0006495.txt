    "the intermetallic compounds of the ybincu@xmath0 family exhibit an isostructural transition from high - temperature state with trivalent yb ions in the @xmath1 configuration to the low - temperature mixed - valent state with yb ions fluctuating between @xmath1 and @xmath2 configurations  @xcite .",
    "the transition is particularly abrupt in high - quality stoichiometric ybincu@xmath0 samples  @xcite with a transition temperature equal to @xmath3  k at ambient pressure ; the susceptibility and the resistivity drop at @xmath4 by more than one order of magnitude in cooling , while the volume expansion is small , @xmath5 .",
    "the valence change inferred from @xmath6 by using the usual ionic radii of yb@xmath7 and yb@xmath8 is about @xmath9 , which is consistent with the valence measurements by the @xmath10-edge absorption  @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature depends strongly on external pressure , magnetic field , and alloying  @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the experimental data is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we just recall the main points which motivate our choice of model .    the integer - valent phase ( @xmath11 ) is characterized by a curie - weiss susceptibility  @xcite with very small curie - weiss temperature @xmath12",
    ". the curie constant corresponds to the free moment of one magnetic f - hole in a @xmath13 spin - orbit state with @xmath14 .",
    "the electrical resistance is large and has a small positive slope ; it remains almost unchanged in magnetic fields up to 30 t  @xcite . in some systems , like yb@xmath15y@xmath16incu@xmath0 ,",
    "the magnetoresistance is slightly negative , while in ybincu@xmath0 ( or ybin@xmath15ag@xmath16cu@xmath0 for @xmath17 ) it is slightly positive  @xcite .",
    "the hall constant is large and negative , indicating a small number of carriers  @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric power has a rather small slope which one finds in a semiconductor with a nearly symmetric density of states  @xcite .",
    "recent data on the optical conductivity of ybincu@xmath0  @xcite shows the absence of a drude peak at high temperatures and a pronounced maximum of the optical spectral weight at about 1 ev .",
    "the high - temperature esr data for gd@xmath7 embedded in ybincu@xmath0 resemble those found in integer - valence semi - metallic or insulator hosts  @xcite .",
    "thus , the high - temperature phase indicates the presence of a well defined local moment but gives no signature of the kondo effect .",
    "the overall behavior of the high - temperature phase is closer to that of a semi - metal or paramagnetic small - gap semiconductor than to a kondo metal .",
    "the mixed - valent phase ( @xmath18 ) behaves like a pauli paramagnet with moderately enhanced susceptibility and specific heat coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the electrical resistance and the hall constant are one order of magnitude smaller than in the high - temperature phase  @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric power  @xcite has a very large slope typical of a valence fluctuator with large asymmetry in the density of states .",
    "the susceptibility , the resistivity and the hall constant do not show any temperature dependence below @xmath4 , which is also typical of valence fluctuators .",
    "the optical conductivity shows a major change with respect to the high - temperature shape .",
    "the peak around 1 ev is reduced , the drude peak becomes fully developed , and an additional structure in the mid - infrared range appears quite suddenly below @xmath4",
    "a large density of states at the chemical potential @xmath19 is indicated by the esr data as well  @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition at @xmath4 seems to be from a paramagnetic semimetal to a valence fluctuator .",
    "in contrast to usual valence - fluctuators , which are quite insensitive to the magnetic field , the ybincu@xmath0 family of compounds also exhibit metamagnetic transitions when @xmath20 .",
    "the yb moment is fully restored at a critical field @xmath21 , with a zeeman energy @xmath22 comparable to the thermal energy @xmath23 .",
    "the metamagnetic transition defined by the magnetoresistance or the magnetization data  @xcite gives an h - t phase boundary @xmath24 .",
    "the zero - temperature field @xmath25 is related to @xmath4 as @xmath26  @xcite .    to account for these features",
    "we need a model in which the non - magnetic , valence - fluctuating , metallic ground state can be destabilized by increasing temperature or magnetic field .",
    "above the transition , we need a paramagnetic semiconductor with an average f - occupancy that is not changed much with respect to the ground state .",
    "the correct model for this system is a periodic anderson model supplemented with a large falicov - kimball ( fk ) interaction term .",
    "the temperature or field induced transition suggests that one should place the narrow f - level just above the chemical potential @xmath19 .",
    "the hybridization keeps the f - count finite below the transition , while large f - f correlations allow only the fluctuations between zero- and one - hole ( magnetic ) configurations .",
    "the low - temperature phase is close to the valence fluctuating fixed point and shows no kondo effect .",
    "however , because of the falicov - kimball term , there is a critical f - occupation at which there is a transition into the high - temperature state with a large gap in the d- and f - excitation spectrum .",
    "the @xmath27 is driven to criticality either by temperature or magnetic field . in the high - temperature phase",
    "the hybridization can be neglected because the f - level width is already large due to thermal fluctuations , and quantum fluctuations are irrelevant .",
    "unfortunately , the above model would be difficult to solve in a controlled way , and here we consider a simplified model in which the hybridization is neglected at all temperatures .",
    "this leads to a spin - degenerate falicov - kimball model which explains the collapse of the non - magnetic metallic phase at @xmath4 or @xmath28 , and gives a good qualitative description of the high - temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , the deficiency of the simplified model is that it yields a negligible f - count in the metallic phase and predicts a large change in the yb valence at @xmath4 or @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear that we can not obtain the valence fluctuating ground state and maintain the average f - occupancy below the transition without hybridization - induced quantum fluctuations . in what follows ,",
    "we describe the model , explain the method of solution , and present results for static and dynamic correlation functions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the falicov - kimball model  @xcite consists of two types of electrons : conduction electrons ( created or destroyed at site @xmath29 by @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) and localized electrons ( created or destroyed at site @xmath29 by @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "the conduction electrons can hop between nearest - neighbor sites on the d - dimensional lattice , with a hopping matrix @xmath34 ; we choose a scaling of the hopping matrix that yields a nontrivial limit in infinite - dimensions  @xcite .",

    "the resulting hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath42 the model can be solved in the infinite - dimensional limit by using the methods of brandt - mielsch  @xcite .",

    "our calculations are restricted to the homogeneous phase .",

    "the numerical implementation of the above procedure is as follows : we start with an initial guess for the self energy @xmath71 and calculate the local propagator in ( [ eq : gloc ] ) . using ( [ dyson ] ) we calculate the bare atomic propagator @xmath72 and find @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "we compute the atomic self energy and iterate to the fixed point .    the iterations on the imaginary axis give static properties , like @xmath27 , the f - magnetization @xmath76 , and the static spin and charge susceptibilities .",

    "( [ eq : gloc ] ) to ( [ dyson ] ) on the real axis and obtain the retarded dynamical properties , like the spectral function , the resistivity , the magnetoresistance , and the optical conductivity . at the fixed point ,",
    "the spectral properties of the atom perturbed by @xmath53-field coincide with the local spectral properties of the lattice .",
    "we studied the model for a total electron filling of 1.5 and for several values of @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "the main results can be summarized in the following way .",
    "the occupancy of the f - holes at high temperatures is large and there is a huge magnetic degeneracy .",
    "the f - holes are energetically unfavorable but are maintained because of their large magnetic entropy . in fig.([n_vs_t ] ) we show @xmath27 as a function of temperature , plotted for @xmath77 , and @xmath78 from -0.2 to -0.7 . below a certain temperature , which depends on @xmath39 and @xmath36",
    ", there is a rapid transition to the low - temperature phase .",
    "the transition becomes sharper and is pushed to lower temperatures as @xmath36 decreases at constant @xmath39 .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to continuous crossovers here , since the region with first - order transitions leads to numerical instabilities .",

    "( [ chi_s_vs_t ] ) .",
    "the high - temperature susceptibility follows an approximate curie - weiss law , but the curie - weiss parameters depend on the fitting interval .    the interacting density of states @xmath83 for the conduction electrons is shown in fig.([dos_vs_omega ] ) for @xmath82 and @xmath84 , and for several temperatures .",
    "( the energy is measured with respect to @xmath19 . )",

    "note , the @xmath104 values in fig.([hc_vs_t ] ) differ by more than an order of magnitude , while the ratio @xmath106 is only weakly parameter dependent .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is also seen in the field - dependent electrical resistance @xmath107 which is plotted in fig.([h_resistance_vs_h ] ) as a function of @xmath102 , for several temperatures . a substantial change in the @xmath107 across @xmath104 or @xmath28",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "from the preceding discussion it is clear that falicov - kimball model captures the main features of the experimental data for ybincu@xmath0 and similar compounds . the temperature- and field - induced anomalies",
    "are related to a metal - insulator transition , which is caused by large fk interaction and triggered by the temperature- or the field - induced change in the f - occupancy . at high temperatures",
    ", we find a large gap in @xmath83 ; we expect a similar gap in the f - electron spectrum as well . at low temperatures ,",
    "both gaps are closed , and the renormalized f - level renormalizes down to the chemical potential .",
    "our calculations describe doped yb systems with broad transitions but appear to be less successful for those compounds which show a first - order transition .",
    "the numerical curves can be made sharper ( by adjusting the parameters ) but they only become discontinuous in a narrow parameter range .",
    "the main difficulty with the fk model is that it predicts a substantial change in the f - occupancy across the transition and associates the loss of moment with the loss of f - holes .",
    "but in the real materials the loss of moment seems to be due to the valence fluctuations , rather than to the reduction of @xmath27 .",
    "the description of the valence fluctuating ground state would require the hybridization and is beyond the scope of this work",
    ". the actual situation pertaining to yb ions in the mixed - valence state might be quite complicated , since one would have to consider an extremely asymmetric limit of the anderson model , in which the ground state is not kondo - like , there is no kondo resonance , and there is no single universal energy scale which is relevant at all temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the periodic anderson model with a large fk term will exhibit the same behavior as the fk model at high temperatures . indeed , if the conduction band and the f - level are gapped , and the width of the f - level is large , then the effect of the hybridization can be accounted for by renormalizing the parameters of the fk model . on the other hand ,",
    "if the low - temperature state of the full model is close to the valence - fluctuating fixed point with the conduction band and hybridized f - level close to the fermi level , then the likely effect of the fk correlation is to renormalize the parameters of the anderson model ."
