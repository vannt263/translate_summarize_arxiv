    "it is often not explicitly mentioned where the work goes to , but the only place work can go to are the externally controlled energy sources . similarly , the heat , i.e. the energy change minus the work , is established implicitly .",
    "for example , in the experimental realisation of classical landauer erasure with a colloidal silica bead trapped in an optical tweezer @xcite , the dissipated heat of erasure was calculated by knowing the applied tilting forces and integrating over the bead s dynamics .",
    "the second approach is to collect work in a separate work storage system @xcite , as illustrated by the weight in fig .",
    "[ fig : overviewpic ] and detailed in appendix  [ app : workstorage ] . both the implicit and the explicit treatment of work are equivalent in the sense that the results obtained in one approach can be translated into the other .    the thermodynamic assumptions made to prove eq .",

    "the projections considered here constitute just one example of the larger class of trace - preserving completely positive ( tpcp ) maps characterising quantum dynamics .",
    "of course , all tpcp maps can be interpreted thermodynamically with the assumptions stated above , resulting in an optimal average work given by a free energy difference .",
    "erasure is another such map whose study forged the link between information theory and thermodynamics .",
    "the benefit of discussing `` projections '' here lies in the insight that this focus provides : it uncovers that coherences offer the potential to draw work making it a genuine and testable quantum thermodynamic feature .",

    "adjusts the strength of the external b - field such that the spin state @xmath46 is boltzmann - distributed at temperature @xmath0 with respect to the energy gap of the hamiltonian at the end of the step , @xmath47 . in nmr or esr the b - field magnitude is tuned quickly on the @xmath48 timescale to achieve the desired energy gap . in the second step",
    ", emmy wants to implement a quasi - static evolution of the spin that is now thermal .",
    "she brings the spin in contact with the heat bath at temperature @xmath0 and quasi - statically adjusts the magnitude of the external b - field allowing the spin state to thermalise at all times . the final b - field , @xmath49 ,",
    "is chosen such that the final thermal state becomes @xmath50 . in esr",
    "this step can be realised by changing the external b - field slowly on the @xmath48 timescale so that the spin continuously equilibrates with its environment .",
    "finally , emmy isolates the spin from the environment and quickly changes the b - field to its original magnitude while the state remains @xmath50 .    during step 1 and 3",
    "the system was isolated and the average work drawn is thus just the average energy change . during step 2",
    "the average work is the equilibrium free energy difference between the final and initial thermal states at temperature @xmath0 , see appendix  [ app : spinexample ] for details . in nmr / esr the work contributions drawn from the spin system are done on the external b - field and the microwave mode .",
    "this could be detected by measuring the stimulated emission of photons in the microwave mode or observing current changes induced by the spins dynamics @xcite .",
    "the overall thermodynamic process has now brought the spin from a quantum state with coherences , @xmath3 , into a state without coherences , @xmath50 , while keeping the average energy of the spin constant .",
    "the net work drawn during the three steps adds up to @xmath51 showing the attainability of the optimum stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmeasure ] ) for the spin-1/2 example .",

    "we emphasise that this optimal implementation involves a finely tuned and controlled operation that relies on knowledge of the initial state @xmath3 .",
    "this is akin to the situation considered in @xcite where knowledge of the initial global state of system and memory is required for optimal erasure with side - information .",
    "it is important to distinguish this situation from that of maxwell demon s who has access to knowledge of the individual micro - states @xmath53 that make up the ensemble state @xmath54 , and who uses it to beat the second law @xcite . in the scenario considered here",
    "there is no knowledge of the individual micro - states @xmath53 and the process does not violate the second law , on the contrary , it is derived from it .",
    "the preceding discussion concerned the _ average _ work that can be drawn when operating on an ensemble of @xmath55 independent spins .",
    "this scenario contrasts with the single shot situation considered in a number of recent publications @xcite .",
    "in particular , two major frameworks @xcite have recently been put forward to identify optimal _ single - shot _ work extraction and work cost of formation in the quantum setting .",
    "these frameworks rely on a resource theory approach @xcite and make use of min- and max - relative entropies that originate from one - shot information theory .",
    "the optimal work extraction schemes of these frameworks require non - diagonal states to be decohered first to become diagonal in the energy basis .",
    "this decoherence step is assumed to not have an associated single - shot work .",
    "however , the present analysis of energy basis projections showed that thermodynamic projection processes can yield positive average work , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmeasure ] ) .",
    "therefore one may expect a positive work for removing coherences from a state @xmath3 in the single - shot setting , too . since our focus is the @xmath1 limit we will not aim to construct the single - shot case . nevertheless , to establish a notion of consistency between single - shot results @xcite and the average analysis presented here we now separate the projection into a diagonal part that can be analysed in the single - shot framework and a non - diagonal part that can be analysed in the average framework .",

    "the key observation was that thermodynamic projection processes can have a non - trivial work and heat .",
    "another instance where this has interesting repercussions is the quantum jarzynski equality @xcite .",

    "the work extracted from the system during the quantum non - equilibrium process turns out to be @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ensemble s state after the unitary evolution , and similarly the average exponentiated work is calculated .",
    "the above identification @xmath77 was made assuming that the system undergoes a unitary process with no heat dissipation .",

    "thus , while the energy difference for the projection is zero , @xmath82 , for states @xmath78 with coherences the entropy difference is not trivial , @xmath83 .",

    "we conclude that the suitability of identifying @xmath85 , and hence the validity of the quantum jarzynski _ work _",

    "an experimenter may have access not only to the system @xmath17 but also the auxiliary systems @xmath91 with which @xmath17 is correlated @xcite .",

    "the latter contribution was previously identified in an inspiring paper by zurek @xcite .",
    "it depends on the choice of projectors and is related to , but broader than , quantum discord @xcite which is optimised over all possible projectors .",
    "this means that even states of system and auxiliary that can be considered classically correlated ( i.e. no discord ) provide an advantage for drawing work contrasting with the erasure process where this only occurs for highly entangled states @xcite .",
    "the gap between these two sets of correlated states is an intriguing fact and calls for further exploration of the link between thermodynamics and information theory in the quantum regime .",
    "to conclude , erasure is not the only irreversible information processing task  in the quantum regime a second fundamental process exists that mirrors landauer s erasure .",
    "in contrast to the minimum heat limit of erasure , thermodynamic projection processes have a maximum work limit . while the former is non - zero for the erasure of classical _ and _ quantum bits , optimal thermodynamic projection processes have a non - zero work _ only _ when applied to quantum states with coherences . the optimal average work stated in eqs .",

    "experiments will be limited by practical constraints , such as achieving a quasistatic process and obtaining the maximum work for pure states which may require , for instance , very large b - fields .",
    "the derivation of the optimal work value is mathematically straightforward , just like that of landauer s principle .",
    "the result s significance is that it opens new avenues of thought and provides key input for the construction of a future quantum thermodynamic framework .",
    "for example , the developed approach opens the door to investigate the connection between microscopic statistical physics and macroscopic thermodynamics in the quantum regime . while it is straightforward to identify the thermodynamic work of quantum processes involving macroscopic ensembles , what is needed is a microscopic concept of work that when averaged , gives the correct macroscopic work .",
    "the microscopic work concept should be valid for general ( open ) quantum processes and quantum states ( including coherences ) , and only require access to properties of the system . while single - shot approaches have discarded coherences @xcite , fluctuating work approaches can not be applied directly to a system undergoing open quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "the observation is also important from the experimental perspective as testing quantum thermodynamic predictions will involve measurement  a projection process .",
    "we have argued that measurements , such as those required in establishing the jarzynski equality , are not necessarily thermodynamically neutral .",
    "indeed , they can be implemented in different physical ways and in general play an active role in thermodynamics , contributing a non - zero average heat and work .",
    "this new perspective gives physical meaning to the change of entropy in the debated quantum measurement process - it provides a capacity to draw work .",
    "specifically , work can be drawn when _",
    "coherences _ of a state are removed during an unselective measurement .",
    "finally , it is apparent that optimal thermodynamic projection processes require use of knowledge of the initial state @xmath3 , i.e. its basis and eigenvalues .",
    "one may be inclined to exclude use of such knowledge , particularly when considering projections in the context of measurement which is often associated with the acquisition of knowledge .",
    "such restriction would necessarily affect the set of assumptions ( t0-t3 , q0-q1 ) in the quantum regime .",
    "these could be changed , for example , to the second law not being possible to saturate ( cf .",
    "t2 ) or to choosing a new quantum non - equilibrium entropy that only considers the state s diagonal entries ( cf . t3 ) .",
    "the latter would mean a departure from standard quantum information theory where entropies are basis - independent .",
    "thus whichever approach one takes - not making or making a restriction - quantum coherences will contribute a new dimension to thermodynamics .",
    "they either lead to non - classical work extraction or they alter the link between information theory and thermodynamics in the quantum regime . the line drawn here between the assumptions ( t0-t3 , q0-q1 ) and results ( eqs .",
