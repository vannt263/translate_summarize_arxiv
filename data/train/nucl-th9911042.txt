    "pairing correlation between nucleons is a key ingredient to describe the structure of neutron stars and finite nuclei .",
    "there are two distinct ways of description of such _ finite - density _ nuclear many - body systems ; the non - relativistic and the relativistic ones .",
    "the latter incorporates the mesons explicitly in addition to the nucleons in terms of a field theory .",
    "both describe the basic properties such as the saturation with a similar quality in different manners .",
    "irrespective of whether non - relativistic or relativistic , however , various theoretical approaches can be classified into two types : one is realistic studies adopting phenomenological interactions constructed for finite - density systems from the beginning ( hereafter we call this the p - type , indicating  phenomenological \" ) , as often done in the studies of heavy nuclei . and the other is microscopic studies based on bare nucleon - nucleon interactions in free space ( the b - type , indicating  bare \" )",
    ". in relativistic studies , typical examples of these two types as for the particle - hole ( p - h ) channel are the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model and the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) method , respectively . as for the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel , that is , pairing correlation ,",
    "a bare interaction was used as the lowest - order contribution in the gap equation  @xcite in a study of the b - type  @xcite .",
    "this is thought to be a good approximation at least for the @xmath1 channel ( refs.@xcite , for example ) .",
    "the first relativistic study of the p - type of pairing correlation in nuclear matter was done by kucharek and ring  @xcite .",
    "they adopted a one - boson exchange ( obe ) interaction with the coupling constants of the rmf model , which we call the rmf interaction hereafter , aiming at a fully selfconsistent hartree - bogoliubov calculation , which we call the p1-type , in the sense that both the p - h and the p - p channel interactions are derived from a common lagrangian .",
    "but the resulting pairing gaps were about three times larger than those accepted in the non - relativistic studies ( see fig.[f6 ] ) .",
    "the reason can be ascribed to the fact that the coupling constants of the rmf model were determined by physics involving only low momenta ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 denoting the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter ) , and therefore the adopted obe interaction is not reliable at high momenta . after a five - year blank , some attempts to improve this were done  @xcite .",
    "but their results were insufficient .",
    "an alternative way is to adopt another interaction in the p - p channel while the single - particle states are still given by the rmf model .",
    "we call this the p2-type",
    ". there are some variations of this .",
    "the first one , which we call the p2a - type , adopts another phenomenological interaction for the p - p channel . actually , the non - relativistic gogny force  @xcite was used combined with the single - particle states of the rmf model for finite nuclei in ref.@xcite and subsequent works , and gave excellent results .",
    "the second variation , which we call the p2b - type , is to adopt a bare interaction that describes the high - momentum part realistically , the bonn potential , again combined with the single - particle states of the rmf model  @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "if one assumes that the rmf model simulates roughly the dbhf calculation , this p2b - type can be regarded as simulating the b - type calculation  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the results of these p2a- and p2b - types are very similar at densities @xmath4 .",
    "this supports a statement that the gogny force resembles a realistic free interaction in the low - density limit  @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) . but",
    "a clear difference can be seen at @xmath5 .",
    "this difference can also be seen in fully non - relativistic calculations ; compare the results in refs.@xcite and  @xcite , for example .",
    "the precise origin of this difference has not been understood well . a comparison after taking the polarization effects which have been known to be important at finite densities  @xcite into account may be necessary ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the third variation , which we call the p2b@xmath6-type , is to parameterize the p - p channel interaction in terms of a few scattering parameters .",
    "this was actually examined by being combined with the dbhf calculation  @xcite , which we call the b@xmath6-type ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this method is free from model - dependent ambiguities and meets the viewpoint of modern effective field theories  @xcite but is applicable only to dilute systems .",
    "these classifications are summarized in table 1 .    since we are interested in a wide density range where the @xmath1 gap exists and would like to respect the selfconsistency in the sense that both the p - h and the p - p channel interactions are derived from a common lagrangian , here we construct a phenomenological relativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction based on the rmf interaction ( the p1-type ) by adjusting to the pairing properties given by the rmf+bonn calculation ( the p2b - type ) . in other words , we aim at constructing an interaction similar to the gogny force in the sense that it reproduces the pairing properties given by the bare interactions in spite of the fact that it was constructed for the finite - density system from the beginning .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present our method of constructing a phenomenological p - p channel interaction for the superfluid gap equation .",
    "this procedure is applied both to the hartree and to the hartree - fock model . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss the pairing properties obtained in the hartree approximation .",
    "note here that we adopt the no - sea approximation throughout this paper and therefore the relativistic hartree model means the so - called relativistic mean field model . in sect .",
    "4 , the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations with or without the modulation of the high - momentum interaction are presented .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "we start from the ordinary @xmath7-@xmath8 model lagrangian density , @xmath9 the antisymmetrized matrix element of the rmf interaction @xmath10 derived from this lagrangian is defined by , @xmath11 under an instantaneous approximation , with tildes denoting time reversal . after a spin average and an angle integration are performed to project out the @xmath12-wave component , its concrete form is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 our policy of constructing a phenomenological interaction proposed above is to introduce a _ density - independent _ parameter @xmath15 so as not to change the hartree part with the momentum transfer @xmath16 which determines the single - particle energies , respecting that the original parameters of the rmf are density - independent . in the hartree - fock model",
    ", the @xmath17 part also contributes to the mean field .",
    "this will be discussed in sect.4 in detail .",
    "since the high - momentum part of the rmf interaction does not have a firm experimental basis as mentioned above , we suppose there is room to modify that part .",
    "needless to say , such a modification should be checked by studying independent phenomena , for example , medium - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "some adjustments of the density - dependent @xmath18 force to the ones that give realistic pairing properties have already been examined in the non - relativistic studies @xcite . among them , a fit to a bare interaction in the @xmath19 channel was done @xcite .",
    "we aim at a similar procedure in the relativistic model for the @xmath20 channel . in the preceding letter",
    "@xcite , the upper bounds of the momentum integration in the gap equation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the nucleon effective mass equation , @xmath23 where the spin - isospin factor @xmath24 = 4 and 2 indicate symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , respectively , were cut at a finite value @xmath15 , as usually done in condensed - matter physics , since the gap increases monotonically until reaching kucharek and ring s value when the model space is enlarged as shown in fig.3 of ref.@xcite , while @xmath25 is left unchanged .",
    "we call this method the sudden cutoff hereafter .",
    "this was done first in ref.@xcite by inspection .",
    "we proposed a quantitative method to determine @xmath15 , which is described below , and obtained 3.60 @xmath26 for the linear @xmath7-@xmath8 parameter set in ref.@xcite .",
    "this value almost coincides with their value , about 3.65 @xmath26 , for the nl2 parameter set .    in the present paper",
    ", we examine smooth cutoffs that weaken the high - momentum part ; a form factor @xmath27 , @xmath28 , is applied to each nucleon - meson vertex in @xmath29 while the upper bounds of the integrals are conceptually infinity .",
    "they are replaced numerically by a finite number , 20 @xmath26 which has been proved to be large enough in ref.@xcite . since there is no decisive reasoning to choose a specific form , we examine four types , @xmath30 note that the sudden cutoff above was applied to @xmath31 , not to @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is determined so as to minimize the difference in the pairing properties from the results of the p2b - type rmf+bonn calculation . assuming the p2b - type roughly simulates the b - type as mentioned in sect.1 , conceptually we aim at fitting to the pairing properties given by the fully microscopic b - type calculation .",
    "here we adopt the bonn - b potential because this has a moderate property among the available ( charge - independent ) versions a , b , and c  @xcite .",
    "the pair wave function , @xmath33 is related to the gap at the fermi surface , @xmath34 and its derivative determines the coherence length  @xcite , @xmath35 which measures the spatial size of the cooper pairs .",
    "these expressions indicate that @xmath36 and @xmath37 carry independent information , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , in strongly - coupled systems , whereas they are intimately related to each other in weakly - coupled ones",
    ". therefore we search for @xmath15 which minimizes @xmath40    where the subscripts  rmf \" and  bonn \" denote the rmf interaction including @xmath15 and the bonn - b potential , respectively , while the single - particle states are determined by the original rmf model in both cases .",
    "the actual numerical task is to solve the gap equation ( [ gapeq ] ) and the effective mass equation for the nucleon ( [ effmass ] ) .",
    "they couple to each other through eq.([spe ] ) and @xmath41 the parameters of the standard @xmath7-@xmath8 model that we adopt are @xmath42 91.64 , @xmath43 136.2 , @xmath44 550 mev , @xmath45 783 mev , and @xmath46 939 mev  @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 in @xmath48 is taken to be 11 ; @xmath49 0.2 , 0.3,@xmath50 , 1.2 @xmath26 .",
    "in the following , the results for symmetric nuclear matter are presented .",
    "those for pure neutron matter are very similar except that @xmath36 is a little larger due to a larger effective mass @xmath51 as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "minimizations of @xmath48 give the optimal values , @xmath52 7.26 , 10.66 , and 10.98 @xmath26 for the first three types of form factor , respectively , as shown in fig.[cutdep](a ) .",
    "we do not choose an optimal @xmath15 for the strong(b ) type because of its pathological @xmath15-dependence shown in fig.[cutdep](b ) .",
    "figure  [ cutdep](b ) shows that the @xmath15-dependence of these smooth cutoff cases is very mild , except for the strong(b ) type , in comparison with the sudden cutoff case .",
    "the very steep @xmath15-dependence in the strong(b ) case is due to the consecutive depression of the attraction and the repulsion at around @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in the strong(a ) case , although another smaller @xmath15 around 3 @xmath26 can give similar @xmath36 , @xmath55 and consequently @xmath56 exhibit an unphysical staggering at around @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we discard this .",
    "in addition , although the strong(a ) case with @xmath52 10.98 @xmath26 gives practically the same @xmath58-dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( in fig.[kfdep ] shown later ) , @xmath59 at @xmath60 brings about an unphysical staggering in @xmath56 and @xmath61 ; this leads to an oscillatory structure in @xmath62-space with a period @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we discard this , too .",
    "form factors with similar @xmath15 are also suggested in a study of medium - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the present results have a physical meaning .",
    "figure  [ kfdep ] presents the results for @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of the fermi momentum @xmath58 , obtained by using the cutoff parameters so determined . both the monopole and the dipole cases reproduce the results from the bonn - b potential very well , as the sudden cutoff case studied in ref.@xcite , in a wide and physically relevant density range , in the sense that pairing in finite nuclei occurs near the nuclear surface where density is lower than the saturation point  @xcite and that the calculated range of @xmath58 almost corresponds to that of the inner crust of neutron stars  @xcite",
    "this is our first conclusion . in the present method with a _ density - independent _ cutoff parameter ,",
    "some small deviations remain : the overall slight peak shift to higher @xmath58 in @xmath36 and the deviation in @xmath37 at the highest @xmath58 are brought about by the systematic deviation in the critical density where the gap closes , between the calculations adopting bare interactions and those adopting phenomenological ones as mentioned above .",
    "the deviation at the lowest @xmath58 is due to the feature that the present model is based on the mean - field picture for the finite - density system ; this is a different point from the three - parameter fitting in refs.@xcite .",
    "actually , in such an extremely dilute system , the effective - range approximation for free scattering holds well  @xcite .",
    "next we look into the momentum dependence at @xmath49 0.9 @xmath26 , where @xmath36 becomes almost maximum .",
    "figure  [ kdep](a ) shows @xmath61 .",
    "it is evident that the monopole form factor gives the result identical to the bonn - potential case as in the sudden cutoff case .",
    "this demonstrates clearly the effectiveness of the interaction constructed here .",
    "since we confirmed that the results of the monopole and the dipole cases coincide within the width of the line , hereafter only the monopole case will be shown as a representative .",
    "this quantity peaks at @xmath64 as seen from eq.([pairwf ] ) .",
    "the width of the peak represents the reciprocal of the coherence length .",
    "equation ( [ pairwf ] ) shows that @xmath61 is composed of @xmath56 and the quasiparticle energy @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ kdep](b ) graphs the former .",
    "the gaps of both the sudden cutoff and the monopole form factor cases are almost identical up to @xmath66 , and deviations are seen only at larger momenta where @xmath65 are large and accordingly pairing is not important .",
    "this is not a trivial result since the bare interaction is more repulsive than the phenomenological ones constructed here even at the momentum region where @xmath56 are almost identical as shown in fig .",
    "[ kdep](c ) .",
    "the reason why we compare the constructed _ p - p channel _ interaction with the bare interaction is as follows : although evidently the rmf interaction corresponds to a medium - renormalized one , not to a bare one , here we aim at constructing an interaction similar to the gogny force in the sense that it reproduces the pairing properties given by the bare interactions in spite of the fact that it was constructed for the finite - density system from the beginning .",
    "accordingly we compare them to see the difference between an effective and a bare interactions which give similar pairing properties .",
    "this figure indicates that the difference is roughly @xmath67-independent .",
    "here we turn to the dependence on @xmath62 , the distance between the two nucleons that form a cooper pair , in order to look into the physical contents further . the gap equation , before the angle integration that results in eq . ( [ gapeq ] ) ,",
    "can be fourier - transformed to the local form , @xmath68 in @xmath62-space in the non - relativistic limit  @xcite .",
    "one can see from this expression that , assuming @xmath69 is finite , @xmath70 is pushed outwards when @xmath71 has a repulsive core , as the brueckner wave functions  @xcite .",
    "this is related to an observation that the gap equation reduces to a schr \" odinger equation for the relative motion of the two particle that form a cooper pair in the limit of @xmath72 , i.e. , at high @xmath67@xcite .",
    "this , on the other hand , masks practically the differences in the repulsive interactions at short range , in other words , widely spread in @xmath67-space .",
    "the @xmath62-space pair wave functions , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a spherical bessel function , at @xmath49 0.9 @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "[ rdep](a ) .",
    "appreciable differences are seen only in the core region as mentioned above .",
    "the coherence length , that is a typical spatial scale of pairing correlation , is about 6 fm at this @xmath58 as shown in fig .",
    "[ kfdep](b ) ; this is almost one order of magnitude larger than the size of the core region .",
    "therefore , practically we can safely use the p - p channel interaction , including the sudden cutoff one , constructed here for the gap equation .",
    "figure  [ rdep](b ) shows the corresponding @xmath75 .",
    "the gaps are positive at the outside of the core and negative inside in all cases .",
    "note here that the gap equation is invariant with respect to the overall sign inversion ; we defined as @xmath76 .",
    "their depths at the inside region reflect the heights of the repulsive core . in the sudden cutoff case",
    ", @xmath75 behaves somewhat differently from others due to the lack of high - momentum components .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have shown that we can construct phenomenologically relativistic p - p channel interactions which give realistic pairing properties by introducing a _ density - independent _ momentum - cutoff parameter to the ( no - sea ) relativistic hartree model . to do this ,",
    "we have fully utilized the property that only the @xmath16 part of the interaction contributes to the hartree mean field . to see the further applicability of the method presented above , the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) model ,",
    "in which the @xmath17 part of the interaction also contributes to the p - h channel , should be examined . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhfb ) model with a momentum - cutoff form factor , by comparison with the corresponding hartree - bogoliubov calculation .",
    "an rhfb calculation with a sudden cutoff was previously done by guimares et al.@xcite .",
    "they obtained very large pairing gaps in the no - sea approximation ( fig .  4 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "before studying the effects of the form factor to modulate smoothly the high - momentum interaction , we examine the sudden cutoff  this is a straightforward extension of our previous calculation in ref.@xcite to the rhfb .",
    "the rhf model was described in detail in refs.@xcite , for example .",
    "the difference from the hartree model is the second term in fig .",
    "this introduces the space component of the vector selfenergy , @xmath77 , and all the lorentz components of @xmath78  the scalar @xmath79 , the vector ( time ) @xmath80 , and the vector ( space ) @xmath77  become momentum dependent : @xmath81 in contrast , in the hartree model , @xmath77 is not present , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are momentum independent , and @xmath80 is fully determined by the input density .",

    "( 5.76 ) - ( 5.79 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "the retardation effect is neglected here .",
    "note that the momentum dependence of @xmath84 is stemming from that of @xmath79 : @xmath85 ( see eq.([effmass ] ) ) .",
    "when pairing is introduced , @xmath86 is replaced by @xmath87 , and therefore @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( eq.([gapeq ] ) ) couple through eqs.([v2 ] ) and ( [ spe ] ) .",
    "when the momentum space is discretized to @xmath92 meshes , these quantities form a set of @xmath93-dimensional coupled non - linear equations ; this is a contrast to the @xmath94-dimensional ones  @xmath91 and a momentum - independent @xmath84 or @xmath79  in the hartree case .    in order to reproduce the saturation ,",
    "the coupling constants are adjusted to @xmath42 83.11 , @xmath43 108.05 with the masses being unchanged @xcite .",
    "we adopt this parameter set for the time being .",
    "other sets will be examined later .",
    "note that the pairing contribution to the energy density around the saturation point is negligible .",
    "first we compare the gap at the fermi surface calculated without a cutoff in rhfb and rhb , in fig .",
    "we call them the full calculations hereafter .",
    "the calculated gaps in the former are larger than those in the latter , by about 4 mev at the maximum , for example .",
    "this difference is brought about by that in the coupling constants rather than the fock effect itself @xcite .",
    "actually we confirmed that a hartree calculation with the coupling constants of the hartree - fock gave almost the same gaps as those given by the hartree - fock calculation although such a calculation destroys the saturation completely .",
    "this result reflects the property that the gap is not sensitive to the detail of the single - particle states .",
    "if the coupling constants of ref.@xcite , @xmath42 96.392 , @xmath43 129.260 are adopted , calculated gaps become even larger ; about 15 mev at the maximum , for example .",
    "but it is evident that this is still smaller than their calculated value in their fig .",
    "the reason for this difference is not clear .",
    "now let us introduce a sudden cutoff in the upper bound of the momentum integrations in @xmath95 s and @xmath91 as in the previous hartree case .",
    "the result is graphed in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] by the long - dashed curve .",
    "although a plateau appears around @xmath52 2 @xmath26 as in the corresponding case in fig .",
    "[ cutdep](b ) , the gap value of the present plateau is about 4.5 mev , which is larger than the physical value given by the bare interaction , about 2.8 mev at this density . applying the same procedure as in the previous hartree case ,",
    "the obtained optimal cutoff is 1.26 @xmath26 .",
    "this indicates that the attractive interaction alone accounts for the physical magnitude of the gap since the @xmath15 of the plateau corresponds to the @xmath67 at which @xmath55 turns from attractive to repulsive  @xcite .",
    "note that evidently the rhfb calculation with this sudden cutoff can not be applied to the case with @xmath96 .",
    "next we proceed to the smooth cutoff  the form factor in the nucleon - meson vertices .",
    "the monopole and the dipole types are examined here . their @xmath15-dependence is included in fig .",
    "the optimal cutoffs are @xmath52 3.40 @xmath26 and 5.02 @xmath26 for the monopole and the dipole types , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than the corresponding ones in the hartree cases since the original gap values given by the full calculation are larger .",
    "interestingly , however , their ratio , @xmath97 , almost coincides with that of the hartree case .",
    "the p - p channel interactions including the optimal monopole form factor are compared in fig .",
    "the high - momentum repulsive part , in particular at lower densities , is strongly suppressed in the rhfb case .",
    "this testifies the discussion about fig .",
    "[ f7 ] above that the optimal cutoffs are smaller . in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] we present @xmath36 and @xmath37 calculated by adopting the optimal cutoffs .",
    "they reproduce the values given by the bonn - b potential to an extent similar to the hartree case or a little better except @xmath36 of the sudden cutoff case . again",
    "the results of the monopole and the dipole form factors coincide with each other within the width of the line .",
    "although the pairing properties of the rhfb with the optimal form factor presented in fig .  [ f9 ] are essentially the same as those of the corresponding hartree calculation , an essential feature of the hartree - fock model is that the form factor can affect the saturation property .",
    "therefore we have to check this before concluding the applicability of the present procedure .",
    "the energy density is graphed as a function of the fermi momentum in fig .",
    "this figure can be compared with fig .",
    "40 in ref.@xcite . here",
    "the pairing correlation energy ( both cases ) and the cutoff contribution ( hartree - fock case only ) are additionally included .",
    "although these two curves almost coincide with each other at low densities , the cutoff effect destroys the saturation in the rhfb case .",
    "this is because suppressing the high - momentum repulsion breaks the balance between the attraction and the repulsion , and the latter contribute more at higher densities ( see fig .",
    "[ f8](a ) ) . to see this more closely , the cutoff dependence of the energy density without the pairing contribution at the saturation density , @xmath98 1.42 @xmath26 ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] . in the large-@xmath15 limit ,",
    "the energy densities approaches to about -15.69 mev , which is 0.38 % less bound than the original value in ref.@xcite , -15.75 mev , because of the instantaneous approximation .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath99 if we call the cutoff which reproduces the pairing properties and which does the saturation properties @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .    up to",
    "now , we used a parameter set of serot and walecka . to complete the discussion , other sets with different characteristics",
    "are also examined here .",
    "one is a set used by bouyssy et al . , @xmath42 69.62 , @xmath43 153.81 , @xmath44 440 mev , @xmath45 783 mev , and @xmath46 938.9 mev , which gives saturation at @xmath98 1.30 @xmath26@xcite .",
    "a distinct feature of this set is that the plateau appears at very small pairing gap ( see fig .",
    "this indicates that the repulsive part also contributes to the gap as in the hartree case , and accordingly , @xmath100 will be larger than in the case of serot and walecka s set . actually , the optimal monopole cutoff is 5.22 @xmath26 , which is larger than 3.40 @xmath26 in the previous case . but fig .",
    "[ f11 ] shows that still @xmath102 .",
    "another is a set used by jaminon et al.@xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this set is that the saturation ( at @xmath98 1.36 @xmath26 ) is given by introducing a  weak \" form factor  @xcite , @xmath103 from the beginning .",
    "note that here @xmath104 is the square of the 4-momentum transfer and therefore this contains a retardation effect .",
    "the parameters are @xmath42 93.87 , @xmath43 127.55 , @xmath44 550 mev , @xmath45 782.8 mev , and @xmath52 7.754 @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath105 is not shown explicitly , 939 mev is adopted .",
    "the rhfb calculation with this form factor under the instantaneous approximation gives pairing gaps which is larger than the physical values ; @xmath106 8.5 mev at the maximum , for example .",
    "this means that still @xmath102 is necessary to reproduce the physical pairing gap .",
    "in all the calculations above , the cutoff in the form factors is common to @xmath7 and @xmath8 . referring to the bonn potential and ref.@xcite , for example",
    ", @xmath107 is another option . of course",
    "large deviations from @xmath108 destroy the saturation at least when the coupling constants are kept unchanged .",
    "we examined some cases in a limited range , @xmath109 0.70 @xmath110 - 1.2 , but the results were negative .",
    "we have constructed phenomenologically a particle - particle channel interaction which suits the gap equation for nuclear matter .",
    "this was done by introducing a density - independent momentum - cutoff parameter to the one - boson exchange interaction derived from the lagrangian of the rmf model and adjusting it to the pairing properties obtained by the bonn - b potential .",
    "the model pairing properties were calculated by using the rmf model in the p - h channel and the bonn - b potential in the p - p channel utilizing the properties that the rmf model simulates crudely - matrices quantitatively . ]",
    "the @xmath111-matrices in the dbhf calculation and that the pairing properties are not sensitive to the detail of the single - particle states . by this procedure we aimed at constructing an interaction like the gogny force in the sense that it reproduces the pairing properties given by the bare interactions in spite of the fact that it was constructed for the finite - density system from the beginning .",
    "the actual determination of the optimal cutoff parameter was done by the method proposed in our preceding letter for the hartree mean field plus a sudden cutoff  @xcite .    in the present paper , first we applied this method to the ( no - sea ) relativistic hartree model plus various types of form factor which modulates the high - momentum repulsion that spoils the pairing properties . among the four types examined , the monopole and the dipole form factors exhibit desired properties .",
    "close analyses in momentum space and coordinate space have clarified that the gap equation involves a mechanism to mask the difference in the short - range repulsion between the bare and the in - medium effective interactions and that , in the typical spatial scale of pairing phenomena determined by the coherence length , practically there are no difference in the pairing properties .",
    "second we performed rhfb calculations with and without a momentum cutoff  a sudden cutoff and two types of form factor .",
    "the reason why we examined the rhfb separately is that the form factor which modulates the @xmath17 part of the interaction also affects the p - h channel .",
    "the same procedure was applied ; the resulting optimal cutoffs are smaller than those for the hartree model because the original gap values given by the full calculation without a cutoff are larger .",
    "interestingly , the ratio @xmath97 almost coincides with that for the hartree model .",
    "having confirmed that these optimal form factors reproduce @xmath36 and @xmath37 with a quality similar to that in the hartree calculation , we looked at the saturation curve of the energy density .",
    "although the results of the rhb and the rhfb each with the optimal form factor coincide with each other up to @xmath112 1 @xmath26 , the result for the latter starts to deviate at larger @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath102 is necessary in order also to reproduce the saturation simultaneously using the rmf interaction both in the p - h and the p - p channels .",
    "this holds also for the other parameter sets with characteristic features mentioned in the previous section .",
    "these results support the observation that the high - momentum components of the original rmf interaction should be refined .",
    "the modulated interaction obtained here by the proposed one - parameter fitting can be successfully used for the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov calculation .",
    "but its applicability to the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculation is limited to low densities .                                                                                            in eq.(11 ) with respect to the cutoff parameter @xmath15 .",
