    "recent progress in scattering theory  @xcite as well as the refinement of experimental analyses  @xcite have been revealing the precise pole position of the @xmath1 meson in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude , apart from the pioneering works in refs .",
    "@xcite ( as a review , see ref .",
    "these activities are establishing the existence of the @xmath1 meson , the lowest scalar - isoscalar resonance in qcd , as it is now listed in the table of the particle data group ( pdg )  . because naive constituent quark models with the @xmath4 description for the scalar mesons have difficulties in reproducing the light mass of the @xmath1 and the mass spectrum of scalar nonets , various internal structures beyond the simple @xmath4",
    "have been proposed : the four - quark state with strong diquark correlation  @xcite , the collective @xmath4 excitation  @xcite , the dynamically generated mesonic molecule  @xcite and the glueball  @xcite .",
    "although several approaches based on qcd have been performed  @xcite , the understanding of the structure of the lowest scalar - isoscalar meson has not been settled yet .",
    "it is our aim to study the internal structure of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "conventionally , the structure of hadrons has been examined by comparing the prediction of the model with the experimental information such as the mass spectrum , the decay properties , and the scattering phase shifts .",
    "an alternative approach is to study the response to the change of the internal / external parameter of the models .",
    "for instance , the structure of the @xmath1 meson was investigated by changing the number of colors ( @xmath5 ) which enables one to extract the @xmath4 component of the mesons  @xcite . following the latter philosophy , in this paper , we focus on the softening phenomena of the @xmath1 meson associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , possibly in hot and/or dense matter .",
    "although the @xmath1 meson has a huge decay width in vacuum , it might become a sharp resonance when chiral symmetry is partially restored in a medium with high temperature and/or density  @xcite . in this case the strong enhancement of the @xmath0 cross section is caused near the threshold in the @xmath6 channel , which is called the softening of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "there have been some attempts to observe the softening experimentally in order to establish the chiral symmetry restoration , but eventually it turns out that the separation of the medium effect from the final state interaction is difficult ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the linear sigma model  @xcite ,",
    "the mechanism of the softening is understood as the decrease of the bare mass of the @xmath1 meson , which leads to the suppression of the phase space and hence the spectrum shows a sharp peak .",
    "the threshold enhancement of the cross section is observed also for the dynamically generated @xmath1 meson without a bare field , owing to the in - medium reduction of the pion decay constant  @xcite . in this case , the mechanism of the softening would be attributed to the enhancement of the attractive @xmath0 interaction , which changes the resonance into bound state .",
    "it is important at this point to recall the property of the dynamically generated @xmath2-wave resonance .",
    "a special nature of the @xmath2-wave resonance is that , when the attraction is increased , the resonance pole on the second riemann sheet moves below the threshold keeping finite width , which is called the _ virtual state _ , prior to becoming the bound state on the first sheet .",
    "this will provide a novel softening pattern , which enables us to discriminate the different structure .",
    "our discussion will be based on a dynamical chiral model in which the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is constructed by respecting the chiral symmetry and unitarity , in order to describe the @xmath1 meson and the softening phenomena .",
    "the @xmath1 meson is expressed as a resonance pole in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude , and we can classify possible origin of the @xmath1 meson into three classes : ( i ) the chiral partner of the pion , ( ii ) @xmath0 molecule state dynamically generated by the @xmath0 attractive interaction , and ( iii ) the cdd ( castillejo - dalitz - dyson ) pole  @xcite whose structure originates in the other mechanism than chiral symmetry . since we study the @xmath0 scattering with the hadronic degrees of freedom , the structures caused by the qcd dynamics , such as the four - quark state and the glueball are classified into this category .",
    "note however that we are not able to pin down the origin of the cdd pole within the present framework .",
    "our classification is similar to the old discussion of the elementarity / compositeness of a particle  @xcite .",
    "we examine these structures of the @xmath1 meson and try to extract the influence of the different structure in the pattern of the softening .",
    "our approach , along the line with refs .",
    "@xcite , is rather schematic ; we utilize two - flavor chiral models and the symmetry restoration is accounted for by the reduction of the chiral condensate @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore not our aim to produce a realistic in - medium spectrum for the quantitative comparison with experimental data , for which one may refer to the state - of - the - art calculations  @xcite .",
    "rather , we want to study the qualitative behavior along with the symmetry restoration , which reflects the structure of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "although the physical sigma meson should be the mixture of different components , we examine simplified models in which the typical structures of the @xmath1 meson are realized .    we also consider the properties of the @xmath1 meson in the symmetry restoration limit for the discussion of the chiral partner of the pion . in refs .",
    "@xcite the possibility of the dynamically generated state as the chiral partner was discussed , based on the degeneracy of the masses in the restoration limit . here",
    "we study the coupling strength of the @xmath1 pole to the @xmath0 scattering state and show that the coupling property is also useful to discriminate the structure of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we formulate the dynamical chiral models to describe the @xmath8 scattering and the @xmath1 meson in section  [ sec : vacuum ] .",
    "the treatment of the symmetry restoration is presented in section  [ sec : restoration ] , together with the analysis of the behavior of the scattering amplitude in the symmetry restoration limit .",
    "numerical study is presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] ; preparing several models with different structure of the @xmath1 meson , we first analyze the amplitude in vacuum to clarify the origin of the pole , and then introduce the symmetry restoration to study the softening phenomena .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary .",
    "here we introduce the dynamical models to describe the @xmath0 scattering in @xmath9 and @xmath10 channel . based on an effective chiral lagrangian",
    ", the tree - level amplitude is derived as the interaction kernel .",
    "we extend the amplitude in a way consistent with chiral symmetry by introducing a parameter which governs the strength of the pole contribution .",
    "we then unitarize the tree - level interaction through the nonperturbative resummation to obtain the full scattering amplitude .      to derive the @xmath0 scattering amplitude ,",
    "we start from the effective chiral lagrangian of the linear sigma model in which the @xmath1 and @xmath11 fields are constrained by chiral symmetry and introduced as the chiral partner : @xmath12 ,     \\label{eq : lagrangian } \\\\",

    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and vacuum expectation value of the @xmath1 field becomes finite , @xmath16 .",
    "three parameters in the lagrangian @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are determined by the physical quantities in the mean - field level : the chiral condensate @xmath7 , the mass of the pion @xmath20 , and the mass of the @xmath1 meson @xmath21 .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath7 is the order parameter of the symmetry breaking and coincide with the pion decay constant @xmath22 at tree level .",

    "the lagrangian   can be rewritten in the nonlinear form by taking @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since this is nothing but the field redefinition , the nonlinearized lagrangian gives exactly the same result with the original form with @xmath28 fields  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlinearized @xmath29 fields are useful to understand the relationship with the chiral perturbation theory where the @xmath30 degrees of freedom is integrated out . in the following , utilizing both representations",
    ", we construct the scattering amplitude in a consistent way with chiral symmetry .",
    "now let us derive the @xmath0 scattering amplitude at tree level .",
    "crossing symmetry requires the @xmath0 scattering amplitude in general to be @xmath31 from the lagrangian  , the tree level contribution to the function @xmath32 is calculated as @xmath33 the last expression can be also derived from the nonlinearized lagrangian  @xcite . if the @xmath1 meson has a large mass and is irrelevant for the low energy scattering , the second term can be dropped and only the first term gives relevant contributions : @xmath34 which corresponds to the leading order contribution to the @xmath0 scattering in the chiral perturbation theory , and thus the second term of eq .   is a part of the next - to - leading order contributions in the low energy expansion . in order to investigate the contribution from the @xmath1 pole term",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath35 in front of the second term as @xmath36 this amplitude reduces to eq .   with @xmath37 and to eq .   with @xmath38",
    "it is worth noting that both eq .   and eq .   [ and therefore the second term of eq .",
    "] satisfy the adler condition @xmath39  @xcite .",

    ", we have examined the softening of the @xmath1 meson in four different models . by comparing model a and model b , we find that the softening of the dynamically generated @xmath1 meson is qualitatively different from the @xmath1 meson as the chiral partner .",
    "the formation of virtual state provides a novel softening phenomena for the dynamically generated sigma meson . in the energy region",
    "close to the threshold , the results in models c and d are similar to the model b , which can be understood by the dominance of the leading order term of low energy expansion .",
    "these observations leads to the following conclusions :    * if there is a bare @xmath1 pole term which approaches to the @xmath0 threshold energy region as we decrease the chiral condensate , the threshold enhancement is driven by the bare pole contribution and the spectral change and the pole trajectory will be those in model a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modela ] ) . * if the bare @xmath1 pole does not exist in the threshold energy region even with the symmetry restoration ( case ii for the symmetry restoration ) , the near threshold spectrum is dominated by the dynamically generated @xmath1 state and the results will be similar to those in model b ( fig .

    "fig : modelb ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the virtual state is essential for the novel softening pattern .",
    "we study the properties of the @xmath1 meson in the @xmath0 scattering associated with the restoration of chiral symmetry , in order to extract the quantity which reflects the origin of the resonance .",

    "it is rather nontrivial result that the dynamically generated @xmath1 behaves like the chiral partner in the symmetry restoration limit .",
    "the present framework grasps the essential feature of the @xmath0 scattering , such as chiral symmetry , analyticity , and unitarity .",
    "we point out the important role of the finite pion mass for the property of the @xmath1 meson associated with the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the finite pion mass changes the qualitative property of the softening , and the behavior of the @xmath1 pole in the restoration limit .",
    "we should however keep in mind that there are some more effects to be included in the realistic situation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath41 meson in @xmath48-channel exchange , @xmath98 channel in three flavors , u@xmath99(1 ) anomaly effect , and so on . among others",
    ", it should be interesting to study the softening phenomena in a framework with exact crossing symmetry  @xcite , since the effect of the crossed channels would be important for the softening behavior around the threshold and the bound state below the threshold .",
    "we hope that the present analysis provides a first step for the systematic study in more realistic framework .",
