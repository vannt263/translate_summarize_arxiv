    "electric circuits of one - dimensional quantum wires are described by laws quite different from those of corresponding classical systems .",
    "these laws are non - local , often quantized , and are generally difficult to derive .",
    "an important first step is the exploration of the properties of junctions of wires .",
    "the linear response conductance of a ( symmetric ) two - terminal junction in the limit of zero temperature has been found to be either zero ( repulsive ) or unity ( attractive interaction ) in units of the conductance quantum @xcite .",
    "most of the existing theories employ the exactly solvable tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) model , in which backward scattering is neglected @xcite .",
    "moreover , for simplicity the fermions are assumed to be spinless , in which case backward scattering only gives rise to a renormalization of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "furthermore , most of the early works on the problem of two tll - wires connected by a junction employed the method of bosonization , or , for special values of the interaction parameter , used a mapping on to exactly solvable models@xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation using a purely fermionic representation in terms of scattering states and a renormalization group ( rg ) approach for the conductance has been pioneered by @xcite .",
    "the latter formulation has several advantages over the bosonic approach .",
    "perhaps the most important difference is that it allows to describe the physically relevant system of a quantum wire ( with interaction between the fermions ) adiabatically coupled to reservoirs ( with negligible interaction ) , whereas the bosonic approach is formulated for the infinite system .",
    "the effect of a finite wire length has only been convincingly derived for a clean wire @xcite ; in the case of wires connected by a junction a plausible , but unproven ad hoc procedure has been proposed @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed below we have reasons to suspect that the latter procedure is not always correct .",
    "the fermionic scattering state approach is generally applicable , allowing for the study of wires with two impurities @xcite , of multi - lead junctions @xcite as well as the inclusion of spin , of backward scattering , @xcite of out of equilibrium situations , @xcite point contact in a quantum spin hall insulator @xcite .",
    "the original model calculation @xcite has been limited to weak coupling . it may be shown , however , that the method can be extended to work in the strong coupling regime as well , by summing up an infinite class of leading contributions in perturbation theory @xcite . in all cases considered so far it has been found that the method provides results in agreement with any available exact results , which builds confidence in its validity .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in the case of a two - lead junction , the contributions neglected in the above - mentioned partial summation are subleading and may be shown to vanish when the fixed points are approached .    generally , the transport behavior of one - dimensional systems at low energy / temperature is dominated by only a few fixed points ( fps ) of the rg flow .",
    "the most common and intuitively plausible fps are those with quantized conduction values , @xmath5 , in units of the conductance quantum @xmath6 ( we consider systems of spin - less fermions ) .",
    "there may , however , appear additional fps associated with noninteger conductance values , usually in the case of attractive interaction .",
    "a particularly well - studied case is that of a symmetric three - lead junction with broken chiral symmetry , as induced by a magnetic flux threading the junction .",
    "this latter problem has been studied by the method of bosonization in chamon2003,oshikawa2006 , and by the functional rg method inbarnabe2005 .",
    "these authors have identified a number of new fps , for attractive interaction .",
    "the discovery of these new fps has sparked interest in the problem of mapping out the complete fixed point structure of the theory , even though most of the interesting new physics appears to be in the physically less accessible domain of strongly attractive interactions .",
    "only the fully symmetric situation of identical wires ( @xmath4 , see below ) has been considered in @xcite . as we have shown in aristov2012a for weak coupling and will show below for any coupling strength , important new physics",
    "is missed by restricting the consideration to the symmetric case .",
    "one result found by @xcite deserves special attention : it is the claim that a new fixed point named @xmath7 ( dirichlet ) exists for strongly attractive interaction ( luttinger parameter @xmath8 ) , which is interpreted as describing multiparticle transport . as a consequence ,",
    "the conductance values at this fp are outside the domain of values allowed by a single particle @xmath9-matrix description . put differently , this requires the excitation of particle - hole pairs at the junction , with say the particle moving into lead @xmath10 , while the hole is going into lead @xmath11 . in our view , at least at zero temperature , and in the linear response regime , such processes are not occurring , because the phase space for particle - hole excitations tends to zero in this limit .",
    "as we will show below , we do not find a fixed point with the characteristics of @xmath7 , but in contrast we find two new fixed points , not discussed in refs .  [ ] .    in principle ,",
    "the y - junction set - up may be realized experimentally by a one - dimensional tunneling tip contacting a quantum wire .",
    "a magnetic flux threading the junction may be created by local magnetic moments at the junction , although this has not been realized experimentally so far .    in this paper",
    "we report results of an rg treatment of electron transport in the linear response regime through a junction of three spinless tll wires threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "we employ a fermionic representation as described in detail in@xcite .",
    "the method has formerly been used in @xcite in the case of y - junctions . more recently",
    "this approach has been used to derive the rg equations for the conductances of a y - junction connecting three tll wires in the absence of magnetic flux , for weak interaction @xcite , and in a recent work for any strength of interaction @xcite .",
    "in@xcite it was found that even in weak coupling , but beyond lowest order , interesting new structures appear .",
    "even a weak higher order contribution may change the rg - flow in a dramatic way . in the present paper",
    "we describe a similar effect : an asymmetry of the three wires of a chiral y - junction to the effect that in the tip wire the interaction strength @xmath12 is different from that in the main wire , @xmath13 , allows to access certain regions in interaction parameter space where a whole line of fixed points rather than a single fixed point is stable .",
    "this happens for attractive interaction only ( @xmath14 )  the line of stable fixed points is connecting two fixed points at two special manifolds of interaction values , ( a ) @xmath15 ; @xmath3 , or ( b ) whenever the condition @xmath16 , @xmath17 is met .",
    "along these fixed point lines the fp values of the conductances are continuously varying . results on this new aspect of transport through y - junctions within weak coupling have been reported in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend our theory into the strong coupling regime .",
    "we derive a general expression for the scale - dependent contribution to the conductances , valid for a junction with any number of leads and any values of interaction @xmath18 in lead @xmath19 .",
    "this result allows to derive rg - equations for the set of independent conductances in the given case .",
    "we go on to evaluate these general expressions for the three - lead junction of the @xmath20-type ( interaction @xmath13 in the main wire and @xmath12 in the tip wire ) in the presence of magnetic flux .",
    "then we determine the six physically allowed fps , and discuss their stability as a function of position in coupling constant space .    in order to compare our results with the recent findings of @xcite for a fully asymmetric junction , we extend our analysis by allowing for full asymmetry of the s - matrix at the junction , while keeping equal interaction in the main wires .",
    "this minimal modification enables us to elucidate the differences between our conclusions and those in @xcite .",
    "we show that the set of rg equations for the most general asymmetric chiral case can be easily derived in our formalism , and allows us to discuss the robustness of our results obtained for the partially asymmetric case ( @xmath21 ) with respect to further asymmetry .",
    "a full analysis of the case @xmath22 is , however , beyond the scope of the present study .",

    "it should be stressed again , that the scaling exponents at the points @xmath23 , @xmath338 , @xmath24 obtained in @xcite coincide with those , calculated within our approach earlier and in the present paper .",
    "let us look closer at the argument of the authors @xcite in favor of the @xmath7 point .",
    "they observe that the pair hopping operator at the fp @xmath24 becomes formally relevant for large attraction , which means that the rg flow generated by such a perturbation should move the system away from the @xmath24 point . at the same time , they show that the perturbations around the proposed @xmath7 points are irrelevant and the @xmath7 point is thus stable .",
    "they do not actually suggest any rg flow , connecting the fps @xmath24 and @xmath7 , because these points are proposed by an ansatz,@xcite rather than determined as zeros of the beta - function of a set of rg equations .",
    "we observe further that the bosonization approach suggests the existence of the stable fp @xmath7 at strong attraction , whereas the existence of such a point is not excluded at weaker attraction , when it only becomes unstable",
    ". therefore it should be meaningful to discuss values of conductance , which exceed the maximum allowed value for one - particle processes , for arbitrary interaction , in particular also for weak interaction .",
    "one may then hypothetically find examples of contributions from pair hopping , which may increase the conductance over its maximum value , even though the subsequent renormalization ( i.e. higher order corrections ) reduces this value to usual one .    from a formal perspective",
    ", contributions to the kubo formula of conductance involving fermion pair processes are certain vertex corrections , first discussed in the context of superconducting fluctuation contributions .",
    "these are the maki - thompson and aslamazov - larkin corrections @xcite .",
    "we showed , however , in our previous work @xcite that vertex corrections vanish at zero temperature in the limit @xmath339 .",
    "it is known that the criterion @xmath340 is crucial for obtaining the correct value of the conductance of the clean luttinger liquid with leads @xcite .",
    "this criterion however does not appear in the analysis of @xcite , where the presence of leads at @xmath341 is modeled at the end of the calculation by introducing `` contact '' resistances , which may be positive or negative depending on the interaction .",
    "after this modeling the authors @xcite conclude that the @xmath7 point exists also in the presence of leads and is characterized by the above values @xmath335 , in violation of the unitarity of the single - particle s - matrix .",
    "the proposed picture raises a natural question about the role of the length of the interacting region @xmath39 . in our fermionic analysis",
    "small @xmath39 correspond to the absence of any renormalization .",
    "by contrast , the result in @xcite reduces to the statement , that a sufficiently long finite region around the y - junction should lead at strong attraction between fermions to the peculiar behavior that a fermion coming from one fermi - liquid lead is scattered to another lead , and takes with it a partner fermion from a third lead .",
    "it is apparently suggested that the finite region close to the junction acts as a pump . if valid , such a picture should have a precursor at moderate strength of interaction .",
    "however , we quoted above the absence of such contributions in the direct perturbative calculations up to the third order in the interaction .",
    "we conclude that the most plausible resolution of the contradiction is that the _ ad hoc _ procedure of modeling the non - interacting outer leads used by @xcite is not correct .",
    "there is no reason why the `` contact resistances '' should be the same for the ideal ( clean ) tll - wire and wires connected by a junction , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented results for the effect of fermion - fermion interaction on the transport properties of three quantum wires joined at a y - junction .",
    "we employed the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model of spinless fermions to calculate the s - matrix and the conductances of this system for the case of equal interaction constants @xmath13 in the main wire and different interaction @xmath12 in the third wire . using a purely fermionic representation we are able to directly describe the physical situation of wires of length l adiabatically attached to reservoirs .",
    "we argue that in this case ( at least at zero temperature ) the scattering is purely elastic ( excitation of particle - hole pairs is excluded ) and therefore described by the single - particle s - matrix ( the s - matrix is strongly renormalized by interaction effects ) .",
    "we calculate the renormalization of the s - matrix from a set of three renormalization group equations for three conductances .",
    "the rg - equations are derived by calculating the leading scale dependent contributions to all orders in the interaction .",
    "these contributions are obtained by analytically solving a set of integral equations ( ladder summation ) . in our earlier work",
    "we have presented arguments suggesting that the selected contributions are the dominant ones , meaning that additional contributions do not change the scaling behavior near the fixed points @xcite .",
    "additional support for the correctness of our method is coming from the fact that our results agree with known results in all cases where these results are well founded .",
    "the relative simplicity of our method allows , however , to consider more complex problems not addressed before , e.g. in the present case anisotropic y - junctions at strong coupling .",
    "as demonstrated in our earlier work , the addition of even small non - symmetric perturbances to a highly symmetric system may change the rg - flow pattern in a qualitative way .",
    "for example , a second order contribution to the tunneling from a tip into a quantum wire is found to destabilize the fixed point corresponding to the tip separated from the ideally conducting wire @xcite .",
    "similarly , a small asymmetry in the interaction constants of tip and wire of a chiral y - junction leads to the appearance of lines of fixed points @xcite .",
    "the fully symmetric chiral y - junction has been studied in great detail by @xcite .",
    "these authors found the emergence of a pair of chiral fps , @xmath25 , which we confirm in our present analysis , extending the considerations to anisotropic interactions @xmath342 .",
    "they also conjectured a new and quite unusual fixed point termed @xmath7 , which in their interpretation involved `` andreev scattering '' , i.e. the tunneling of fermion pairs .",
    "such processes necessarily involve particle - hole excitations , which we exclude from the beginning ( these processes have vanishing phase space in the limit of zero excitation energy ) .",
    "the existence of the new fp was argued in @xcite to be necessary to complete the rg flow pattern .",
    "we agree that new fixed points are necessary at large attractive interaction .",
    "however , we find in the isotropic case a set of additional unstable chiral fps , @xmath216 , in the domain of attractive interaction , @xmath183 , serving a similar purpose .",
    "the emergence of @xmath216 allows to stabilize the fp @xmath26 . in the anisotropic case",

    "however , our results differ from theirs in two respects : we do not find their fixed point @xmath7 , which violates the unitarity of the single particle s - matrix , but instead find additional fixed points not discovered by them .",
