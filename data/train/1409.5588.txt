    "the term `` quasi - satellite '' was first used in a scientific publication by danielsson & ip ( 1972 ) while trying to explain the resonant behaviour of the near - earth object ( neo ) 1685 toro ( 1948 oa ) .",
    "however , this early mention was not directly connected with its current use .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the term was first introduced and popularized among the scientific community by mikkola & innanen ( 1997 ) , although the concept behind it was initially studied by jackson ( 1913 ) and the energy balance associated with the resonant state was first explored by hnon ( 1969 ) , who coined the term `` retrograde '' satellites to refer to them .",
    "further analyses were carried out by szebehely ( 1967 ) , broucke ( 1968 ) , benest ( 1976 , 1977 ) , dermott & murray ( 1981 ) , kogan ( 1989 ) and lidov & vashkovyak ( 1993 , 1994a , b ) .",
    "most of this early work was completed within the framework of the restricted elliptic three - body problem .",
    "the quasi - satellite dynamical state is a specific configuration of the 1:1 mean motion resonance with a host planet in which the object involved appears to travel around the planet but is not gravitationally bound to it , i.e. the body librates around the longitude of its associated planet but its trajectory is not closed .",
    "the first minor body to be confirmed to pursue a quasi - satellite orbit was 2002  ve@xmath4 that is companion to venus ( mikkola et al .",
    "objects in this dynamical state have been found following ceres and vesta ( christou 2000b ; christou & wiegert 2012 ) , jupiter ( kinoshita & nakai 2007 ; wajer & krlikowska 2012 ) , saturn ( gallardo 2006 ) , neptune ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012c ) and pluto ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012a ) .",
    "so far , jupiter has the largest number of documented quasi - satellites with at least six , including asteroids and comets ( wajer & krlikowska 2012 ) .",
    "our planet comes in second place with three detected quasi - satellite companions : ( 164207 ) 2004  gu@xmath0 ( connors et al . 2004 ; mikkola et al .",
    "2006 ; wajer 2010 ) , ( 277810 ) 2006  fv@xmath1 ( wiegert et al . 2008 ; wajer 2010 ) and 2013  lx@xmath2 ( connors 2014 ) . as such , these objects are not real , gravitationally bound satellites but , from earth s point of view , they appear to travel in the retrograde direction around it over the course of a year although they actually orbit ( in the prograde direction ) the sun .",
    "large amounts of interplanetary dust particles are also temporarily trapped in earth s quasi - satellite resonance ( kortenkamp 2013 ) and our planet hosts a small population of transient irregular natural satellites or mini - moons that may have been quasi - satellites before becoming temporarily bound to the earth ( granvik , vaubaillon & jedicke 2012 ; bolin et al .",
    "2014 )    here , we show that the recently discovered asteroid 2014  ol@xmath3 is a quasi - satellite companion to the earth .",
    "the object was originally selected as a co - orbital candidate because of its small relative semimajor axis , @xmath5 0.0002 au ; @xmath6-body calculations are used to confirm its current quasi - satellite engagement with our planet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly outline our numerical model .",
    "section 3 focuses on 2014  ol@xmath3 .",
    "section 4 reviews the current dynamical status of 164207 , 277810 and 2013  lx@xmath2 , using their latest orbital solutions .",
    "section 5 provides a comparative dynamical analysis between 2014  ol@xmath3 and the other three earth quasi - satellites .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "here , we use @xmath6-body calculations to study the librational properties of the principal resonant angle of 2014  ol@xmath3 with the earth in order to understand its current dynamical status . as an earth co - orbital candidate ,",
    "the key object of study is the oscillation of the difference between the mean longitudes of the object and the earth or relative mean longitude , @xmath7 .",
    "the mean longitude of an object is given by @xmath8 = @xmath9 + @xmath10 + @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the mean anomaly , @xmath10 is the longitude of the ascending node and @xmath11 is the argument of perihelion ( see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "an object is co - orbital to the earth if @xmath7 oscillates ( librates ) around a constant value ; if @xmath7 can take any value ( circulates ) , then we have a passing object .",
    "if @xmath7 librates around 0@xmath12 , we have the quasi - satellite state ; the minor planet orbits the sun in an approximate ellipse with the same ( mean ) period as the earth",
    ". however , when viewed in a frame of reference that corotates with the earth , the quasi - satellite follows a retrograde path around our planet over the course of an orbital period , the sidereal year . in principle , such motion is stabilized by the host planet .",
    "the stability of quasi - satellite orbits has been studied by mikkola et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and sidorenko et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations presented here were completed using a hermite integration scheme ( makino 1991 ; aarseth 2003 ) .",

    "relative errors in the total energy at the end of the simulations are @xmath13 .",
    "the equivalent error in the total angular momentum is several orders of magnitude smaller .",

    "in addition to the calculations completed using the nominal orbital elements in table [ elements ] , we have performed 75 control simulations for each object with sets of orbital elements obtained from the nominal ones within the accepted uncertainties ( up to 6@xmath15 ) that reflect the observational incertitude in astrometry . in any case , the control orbits start very close to the nominal ones as the gaussian errors are quite small ( see table [ elements ] ) .",
    "the computed set of control orbits follows a normal distribution in the six - dimensional orbital parameter space .",
    "the orbital evolution is computed in both directions of time at least for 30 kyr .",

    "in contrast , both nodes of 164207 are currently near the earth , the ascending node of 277810 is perturbed by mars and the descending one is relatively free from perturbations by venus ; the descending node of 2013  lx@xmath2 is perturbed by mars and its ascending one is also relatively free from perturbations by venus .",
    "the kozai resonance is effective in protecting the paths of 277810 and 2013  lx@xmath2 against close encounters with the earth ",
    "moon system as their nodes are away from it , stabilizing their orbits but makes the orbit of 164207 rather unstable . here",
    ", the libration occurs at @xmath11 = -90 , not 0or 180 . under these circumstances , aphelion and perihelion",
    "always occur away from the ecliptic plane . a common feature of the orbital evolutions of 164207 and 2014  ol@xmath3 is in their enhanced instability when compared to the other two .",
    "this translates into relatively frequent episodes in which we observe switching between resonant states .",
    "transfers between tadpole , horseshoe and quasi - satellite orbits are triggered by close encounters with the inner planets and those are the result of the libration of the nodes ( wiegert , innanen & mikkola 1998 ) .",
    "asteroids 277810 and 2013  lx@xmath2 do not exhibit kozai - like dynamics outside the timeframe in which they are quasi - satellites .",
    "although there are no two earth quasi - satellites alike , the closest dynamical relative to 2014  ol@xmath3 is 164207 .",
    "it also stays as an earth quasi - satellite for about 1 kyr ( see fig . [ all ] , second column , panel g ) which is consistent with previous results presented by wajer ( 2010 ) .",
    "it was a horseshoe librator prior to its capture as quasi - satellite and it will return to that resonant state after its eviction .",
    "figure [ all ] shows that only the earth - moon system plays a significant role in destabilizing its orbit ; contrary to previous results in wajer ( 2010 ) , venus does not appear to play a significant role in the current dynamical evolution of this object .",
    "the orbits of 164207 and 2014  ol@xmath3 can only be accurately calculated for a few hundred years forward and backward in time . in sharp contrast , 277810 remains in the quasi - satellite state for a long period of time .",
    "our calculations agree reasonably well with those of wajer ( 2010 ) , the object has remained in its current state for more than 15 kyr and it will remain there for a few thousand more years .",
    "discrepancies with wajer ( 2010 ) could be the result of using updated orbits and different physical models .",
    "chaotic orbits are not only sensitive to changes in the initial conditions but also to different dynamical models .",
    "although connors ( 2014 ) classifies 2013  lx@xmath2 as quasi - satellite , this is incorrect in strict sense because its orbit is hybrid .",
    "it is a persistent co - orbital companion to the earth that follows a compound quasi - satellite - tadpole orbit that encloses earth s lagrangian points l@xmath27 and l@xmath26 , as well as the earth itself ( see e.g. namouni 1999 ; namouni et al .",
    "1999 ) . in principle , close encounters are possible with mercury , venus , the earth and mars but the asteroid is temporarily protected against close approaches by a kozai - like resonance with jupiter .",
    "its dynamics is somewhat similar to that of the well studied apollo asteroid 10563 izhdubar ( 1993 wd ) although the argument of perihelion of this object librates around 90(see christou 2000a ) not 0 . even if not strictly a quasi - satellite , 2013  lx@xmath2 is the most stable of the group with a most probable duration of its current state in the range of 35 to 45 kyr",
    "in this paper , we have identified yet another earth quasi - satellite , 2014  ol@xmath3 .",
    "its dynamical status is temporary and it is not expected to last more than 1 to 2 kyr as this object is one of the most unstable known earth quasi - satellites ; its e - folding time is @xmath281 kyr . in the solar system and among the terrestrial planets , the earth has the largest number of detected quasi - satellites with four ; this is likely to be the result of observational bias , though .",
    "a comparative analysis of the short - term dynamical evolution of these objects shows that they are , dynamically speaking , very heterogeneous although three objects exhibit kozai - like dynamics .",
    "the identification of kozai librators among members of the neo population is not new ( see e.g. michel & thomas 1996 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013b ) .",
    "this indicates that the kozai resonance plays a significant role in the orbital evolution of many earth quasi - satellites and also in the chain of events that drives them into this particular resonance and away from it . in this context ,",
    "2014  ol@xmath3 is an outlier as it is the only currently known earth quasi - satellite not to be submitted to a kozai resonance .",
    "given their current orbits , none of the objects discussed here may impact our planet within the next few hundred (164207 ) 2004  gu@xmath0 and 2014  ol@xmath3 or even several thousand (277810 ) 2006  fv@xmath1 and 2013  lx@xmath2 years .",
    "although these four objects are currently experiencing quasi - satellite episodes within the 1:1 mean motion resonance with the earth , their dynamical contexts are quite different hinting at a richer picture of the quasi - satellite state than conventionally portrayed , with multiple pathways to the same resonant phase .",
    "the diverse dynamical histories found for the members of this group make a common origin for any pair of them rather unlikely .    in this work , relativistic terms and the role of the yarkovsky and yarkovsky  okeefe  radzievskii",
    " paddack ( yorp ) effects ( see e.g. bottke et al .",
    "2006 ) have been ignored .",
    "the non - inclusion of these effects has no impact on the evaluation of the present dynamical status of the minor bodies studied here but may affect predictions regarding their future evolution and dynamical history .",
    "in particular , the yarkovsky effect may have a role on the medium- and long - term evolution of objects as small as the minor bodies discussed here .",
    "proper modelling of the yarkovsky force requires knowledge on the physical properties of the objects involved ( for example , rotation rate , albedo , bulk density , surface conductivity , emissivity ) which is not the case for these minor bodies .",
    "perturbational effects arising from the co - orbital evolution with our planet may render these non - gravitational effects negligible , though .",
