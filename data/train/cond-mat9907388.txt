    "the symmetry and the dimensionality are important factors to determine the universality class of critical phenomena .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry is the simplest among the continuous symmetry , and statistical models with the @xmath2 symmetry has been studied intensively . a natural question",
    "then would be the effect of the symmetry breaking from the continuous @xmath2 to the discrete @xmath0 .",
    "a simple spin model with @xmath0 symmetry is the @xmath3-state clock model with a hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 runs over nearest neighbors , and @xmath6 takes integral multiples of @xmath7 .",
    "the standard xy model with @xmath2 symmetry is defined by the hamiltonian of the same form ; the only difference is that @xmath8 takes continuous values .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is fundamentally different from @xmath2 because of its discrete nature . on the other hand , for large @xmath3",
    ", it is natural to expect the @xmath0 symmetry to have similar effects to that of the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "understanding these two apparently contradictory aspects is an interesting problem .",
    "besides the theoretical motivation , there are some possible experimental realizations of the effective @xmath0 symmetry . for example",
    ", the stacked triangular antiferromagnetic ising ( sti ) model with effective @xmath1 symmetry may correspond to materials such as@xcite csmni@xmath9 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath0 model is well understood@xcite in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) . for @xmath10 ,",
    "there is an intermediate phase between the low - temperature ordered phase with the spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry and the high - temperature disordered phase .",
    "the intermediate phase is @xmath2 symmetric and corresponds to the low - temperature phase of the xy model .    on three dimensional ( 3d ) case ,",
    "blankschtein et al.@xcite in 1984 proposed an rg picture of the @xmath1 models , to discuss the sti model .",
    "they suggested that the transition between the ordered and disordered phases belongs to the ( 3d ) xy universality class , and that the ordered phase reflects the symmetry breaking to @xmath1 in a large enough system .",
    "it means that there is no finite region of rotationally symmetric phase which is similar to the ordered phase of the xy model .",
    "unfortunately , their paper is apparently not widely known in the related fields .",
    "it might be partly because their discussion was very brief and not quite clear .",
    "in fact , there has been a long - standing controversy on the the three - state antiferromagnetic potts ( afp ) model on a simple cubic lattice , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath5 runs over nearest neighbor pairs on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the order parameter of this model is not evident .",
    "however , previous studies revealed that the low - temperature ordered phase , which is called as broken sublattice symmetry ( bss ) phase@xcite , corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry . thus the effective symmetry of this model may be regarded@xcite as @xmath1 , although it is not apparent in the model .",
    "it is now widely accepted that there is a phase transition with critical exponents characterized by the 3d xy universality class@xcite , at temperature @xmath13 ( we set the boltzmann constant @xmath14 . ) on the other hand , according to numerical calculations , there appears to be an intermediate phase below @xmath15 and above the low - temperature phase .",
    "while there have been various proposals@xcite for the intermediate region , most reliable numerical results at present indicates that the intermediate region appears to be rotationally symmetric phase which is similar to the ordered phase of the 3d xy model@xcite .",
    "however , the `` transition '' between the intermediate region and the low - temperature phase is not well understood .",
    "according to the suggestion in ref .  , the intermediate `` phase '' would be rather a crossover to the low - temperature massive phase .",
    "on the other hand , there has been a claim of an intermediate phase@xcite also in the @xmath16-state clock ( 6cl ) model , which has the manifest @xmath1 symmetry . in a recent detailed numerical study",
    ", miyashita@xcite found that the intermediate region appears to have a rotationally symmetric character , as found in the afp model .",
    "however , through a careful examination of the system size dependence , he concluded that it is just a crossover to the massive low - temperature phase , and that the rotationally symmetric xy phase does not exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "his conclusion is consistent with the suggestion in ref .  .",
    "in this article , based on the rg picture , we derive a scaling law of an order parameter which measures the effect of symmetry breaking from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that the monte carlo results on the afp model in ref .",
    "is consistent with the scaling law , supporting the rg picture with a single phase transition .",
    "since the discussion of the rg picture in ref .   was rather brief , it would be worthwhile to present the rg picture here , with some clarifications and more details .",
    "we also make a straightforward extension to general integer @xmath3 from the @xmath17 case .",
    "a generic @xmath0 symmetric model may be mapped , in the long - distance limit , to the following @xmath18-type field theory with the euclidean action @xmath19\\ ] ] with the complex field @xmath20 and its conjugate @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22-term is the lowest order term in @xmath20 which breaks the symmetry from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "the phase transition corresponds to the vanishing of ( the renormalized value of ) the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature @xmath24 in the @xmath0 statistical system roughly corresponds to @xmath23 as @xmath25 where @xmath15 is the critical temperature .    in the absence of the symmetry breaking @xmath22",
    ", the transition belongs to the so - called 3d xy universality class .",
    "its stability under the symmetry breaking to @xmath0 is determined by the scaling dimension of @xmath22 at the 3d xy fixed point .",
    "it may be estimated with the standard @xmath26-expansion method .",
    "the lowest order result in @xmath26 can be easily obtained from the operator product expansion ( ope ) coefficients@xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtain the scaling dimension @xmath27 of @xmath22 in @xmath28 dimensions as @xmath29 @xmath27 is defined so that the effective strength of the perturbation @xmath30 at scale @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 near the xy fixed point .",
    "the case @xmath33 is actually the special case @xmath34 of the `` cubic anisotropy '' on the 3d @xmath35 fixed point@xcite . extrapolating the @xmath36 result to 3d ( @xmath37 )",
    ", we see that the @xmath0 perturbation is irrelevant at the 3d xy fixed point for @xmath38 .",
    "the threshold @xmath39 is estimated to be @xmath40 in @xmath36 in fact , @xmath41 and @xmath42 corresponds to the 3d ising and 3-state ( ferromagnetic ) potts model , which do not belong to xy universality class .",
    "thus @xmath39 is expected to be at least @xmath40 .",
    "this is consistent with the above result from @xmath36 .",
    "however , extrapolating the lowest order result in @xmath26 to 3d ( @xmath37 ) is not quite reliable ; the true value of @xmath39 might be larger than @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , we can make following observation . for @xmath43 , @xmath22 is marginal or irrelevant at the 3d gaussian fixed point ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus it is natural to expect them to be irrelevant at the more stable 3d xy fixed point , namely @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the numerical observation of the 3d xy universality class in 6cl and afp model strongly suggests that @xmath46 is irrelevant at the xy fixed point and hence @xmath45 . in the following ,",
    "we restrict the discussion to the irrelevant case @xmath38 .    for the @xmath2 symmetric case @xmath47",
    ", low - temperature phase @xmath48 is renormalized to the low - temperature fixed point .",
    "it describes the massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes on the groundstate with the spontaneously broken @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "let us call the low - temperature fixed point as ng fixed point . in terms of the field theory ,",
    "it is described by the @xmath2 sigma model ( free massless boson field ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angular variable @xmath51 .",
    "namely , only the angular mode @xmath50 remains gapless as a ng boson . in three dimensions , the coupling constant @xmath52 renormalizes proportional to the scale @xmath31 , and goes to infinity in the low - energy limit .",
    "the coupling constant may be absorbed by using the rescaled field @xmath53 so that the action is always written as @xmath54 .",
    "now let us consider effects of the symmetry breaking @xmath22 .",
    "the symmetry breaking term can be written as @xmath55 . using the rescaled field @xmath8 , the total effective action at scale @xmath31 becomes @xmath56 } , \\ ] ] where the factor @xmath57 comes from the scale transformation of the integration measure . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we should take @xmath58 limit .",
    "physically , it means that the @xmath2 symmetry is spontaneously broken so that the angle is fixed to some value @xmath59 in a single infinite system",
    ". then the taylor expansion of the cosine in @xmath60 becomes valid : @xmath61 }       = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty } c_j k^{3-j/2 } \\theta^j , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 for a nonnegative integer @xmath63 .",
    "the five terms @xmath64 are relevant perturbations . for any value of @xmath59 , some of the coefficients @xmath65 of these relevant terms are non - vanishing .",
    "we therefore conclude that , unlike the 2d case , the @xmath0 perturbation is always relevant for any value of @xmath3 at the ng fixed point . we emphasize that this conclusion is universal in three dimensions and independent of the microscopic model . shortly speaking",
    ", the @xmath0 perturbation gives mass to the pseudo ng boson @xmath8 , which would be massless ng boson in the absence of the perturbation .",
    "in contrast , in two dimensions the coupling constant @xmath52 of the free boson field theory is dimensionless , and the above argument does not apply .",
    "it is related to the absence of a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry .",
    "we now have a global picture of the rg flow as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgflow ] .",
    "the phase transition between the ordered phase and the disordered phase is governed by the xy fixed point .",
    "this means that the critical exponents are identical to those of the xy model .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical results . in the disordered phase above @xmath15",
    ", there will be no essential effect of the @xmath0 perturbation .",
    "however , the nature of the ordered phase is more interesting .",
    "the @xmath0 perturbation @xmath22 is eventually enhanced in the ordered phase below @xmath15 .",
    "it means that all region below @xmath15 belong to the massive phase with the spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "there is no rotationally symmetric intermediate phase , unlike the 2d case . only a precisely @xmath2 symmetric model with @xmath66",
    "is renormalized to the ng fixed point below @xmath15 , corresponding to the rotationally symmetric low - temperature phase .",
    "an interesting aspect of the rg flow diagram is that the @xmath0 perturbation is irrelevant at the 3d xy fixed point but is relevant at the low - temperature ng fixed point .",
    "this could be related to a nontrivial system size dependence found in a monte carlo renormalization group calculation@xcite . for @xmath24",
    "slightly less than @xmath15 , the symmetry breaking perturbation @xmath22 is renormalized to a small value by the rg flow , and remains small until the rg flow reaches near the ng fixed point .",
    "it means that the mass of the pseudo - ng bosons is suppressed by the fluctuation effect . at a finite scale ( for example in a finite size system ) , the ordered phase near @xmath15 is very similar to the low - temperature phase of the xy model .",
    "this naturally explains the numerical observation of the apparently rotationally symmetric `` phase '' in 6cl or the afp model . for larger @xmath3 ,",
    "the mass is more suppressed , and the low - temperature side of the transition appears to be @xmath2 symmetric until the system size becomes very large . however , for any finite @xmath3 , the low - temperature side of the transition @xmath67 is not truly massless nor @xmath2 symmetric in the thermodynamic limit , as already pointed out .",
    "based on the rg picture , we derive a scaling law on an order parameter @xmath68 which characterizes the symmetry breaking from the @xmath2 to @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "there are various possible definitions of @xmath68 . on the 6cl model ,",
    "miyashita@xcite numerically measured an order parameter @xmath69 which corresponds to the effective barrier height . on the afp model , heilmann , wang and swendsen@xcite studied @xmath70 , which is the fourier transform of the angle distribution density of average spins .",
    "the following consideration apply to the both cases .    for large enough @xmath71 and @xmath24 slightly lower than @xmath15",
    "we divide the rg flow to three stages , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ]    ( i ) : :    the rg flow near the 3d xy fixed point .",
    "the symmetry breaking    @xmath22 is irrelevant , and is renormalized    proportional to @xmath72 at length scale    @xmath31 .",
    "( ii ) : :    the rg flow from the neighborhood of the 3d xy fixed point to the ng    fixed point . for simplicity , we assume that the symmetry breaking    @xmath22 is unchanged in this stage .",
    "( iii ) : :    the rg flow near the ng fixed point .",
    "@xmath22 is    relevant , giving a mass to the ng boson .",
    "the length scale @xmath73 , at which the crossover from stage ( i ) to ( ii ) occurs , is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the correlation length exponent of the 3d xy universality class .",
    "thus , at the crossover , @xmath76 this also gives the effective value of the perturbation @xmath22 at the crossover from stage ( ii ) to stage ( iii ) .    in the presence of the @xmath0 perturbation",
    ", the spin configuration would be dominated by the ordered regions which are separated by domain walls in a large system .",
    "the free energy costed by the domain walls is proportional to their area , which scales as @xmath77 for the system size @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the effective `` barrier height '' is proportional@xcite to @xmath77 . combining this with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmdscale ] ) , we conclude that the order parameter is a function of a single scaling variable : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant .",
    "the function @xmath80 is universal , but of course depends on the definition of the @xmath68 . while the scaling by @xmath77 was used in ref .  , we find that the temperature dependence of the order parameter is also governed by a scaling .",
    "interestingly , the exponent @xmath81 is completely determined by the 3d xy fixed point .",
    "in the numerical study@xcite of the afp model , they claimed the existence of the intermediate phase , in which the order parameter @xmath70 is very small even for relatively large lattice ( upto @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , we re - analyze their data to demonstrate the scaling relation  ( [ eq : orderp ] ) , and hence the validity of the rg picture . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , we show the data taken@xcite from fig .  3 of ref .  .",
    "we chose @xmath83 to give the best scaling .",
    "the data for various temperature and various system sizes fall remarkably into a single curve as a function of the scaling variable @xmath84 .",
    "this supports the proposed scaling relation  ( [ eq : orderp ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if we approximate the effective potential by @xmath85 , the scaling function is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the modified bessel function .",
    "choosing @xmath88 , the scaled data agree with this simple function rather well .",
    "we note that the data appear to deviate from the scaling law for small @xmath89 .",
    "this may be due to the insufficient system size @xmath71 or the relatively large statistical error .",
    "we emphasize that the present scaling relation is a strong evidence of the single phase transition at the temperature @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the scaling of the `` spontaneous magnetization '' @xmath90 does not distinguish our picture and the `` intermediate phase '' scenario of ref .  .    on the other hand , the scaling function @xmath91 for @xmath69 in ref",
    "is linear in @xmath89 by definition .",
    "he indeed found that @xmath69 is scaled by @xmath77 .",
    "however he did not discuss the temperature depedence .",
    "we have attempted to analyze the data in figs .  6 and 7 in ref .",
    ", to find that they are roughly consistent with our scaling law  ( [ eq : orderp ] ) with the exponent @xmath92 .",
    "the estimate is difficult because there are only small number of temperature points available in ref .  .",
    "according to our picture , the exponent @xmath93 is a universal quantity determined by the 3d xy universality class .",
    "considering the available data , the above results on afp and 6cl models are consistent with the universality hypothesis , although not conclusive .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain more numerical data on these models to check our scaling law  ( [ eq : orderp ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath75 has been determined as @xmath94 for the 3d xy universality class@xcite . combining with the above estimates of @xmath93 , @xmath95 is estimated as about @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , the irrelevant eigenvalue @xmath96 has not been much discussed in the literature .",
    "the lowest order result  ( [ eq : yn1 ] ) in the @xmath26-expansion gives @xmath97 , which is not quite consistent with the numerical estimate .",
    "however , it is perhaps not surprising to obtain an inaccurate result in the lowest order of the @xmath26-expansion",
    ". it would be interesting to carry out the calculation to higher orders in @xmath26 , or to estimate @xmath96 by other means .",
    "in this article , we clarified a rg picture of phase structure of 3d @xmath0 symmetric models , which was introduced earlier by blankschtein et al.@xcite .",
    "there is no finite region of intermediate phase with a ( spontaneously broken ) @xmath2 symmetry , but only a crossover to a massive phase where the discreteness of @xmath0 is relevant .",
    "based on the rg picture , we have derived a scaling law of the order parameter in the 3d @xmath0 models the existing monte carlo data@xcite on the afp model , which was used to claim the intermediate phase , was shown to be consistent with the scaling law .",
    "thus we conclude that the rg picture is valid on the afp model , and there is only one transition at @xmath13 with the 3d xy universality class .",
    "we would like to make a few final remarks .",
    "firstly , we note that the rg argument used in the present article does not contradict to the transition of other than xy universality class , because only the local stability of the xy fixed point was discussed .",
    "it is possible that a lattice model with @xmath0 symmetry is renormalized to another ( unknown ) rg fixed point .",
    "actually , it appears somewhat controversial whether the transition of the sti model belong to the xy universality class@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the available numerical results strongly supports that the 6cl and afp models at the critical temperature are renormalized into the xy fixed point .",
    "once the transition is known to be xy universality class , the rg picture and the scaling law discussed in this article should apply to the ordered phase , for the temperature slightly below the critical point .    secondly , as discussed in ref .",
    ", the `` bare '' value of @xmath22 ( at a small length scale ) may have opposite sign in some circumstances .",
    "namely , the minima and maxima of the potential of @xmath50 are swapped . in such a case",
    ", the ordered phase may correspond to the permutationally symmetric sublattice ( pss ) phase proposed in ref .",
    "for the afp model , or the incompletely ordered phase ( iop ) proposed in ref .   for the 6cl model .",
    "in the vicinity of the critical point , the temperature dependence of the bare @xmath22 is not essential because the leading dependence on the temperature is determined by the critical effect , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : orderp ] ) .",
    "however , it may be important in a wider temperature range . in particular , if the bare @xmath22 changes sign at some temperature @xmath98 lower than @xmath15 , we would have a transition@xcite at @xmath98",
    "such a transition would be controlled by the ng fixed point .",
    "the existing numerical data indicates that there is no such phase transition in the standard afp model on the simple cubic lattice or in the standard 6cl model .",
    "however , such a transition may be possible in some modified models@xcite .",
    "in fact , blankschtein et al.@xcite argued it to exist in the sti model .",
