    "thermodynamics is the study of the flow of heat and the transformation of work into heat .",
    "our understanding of thermodynamics is largely confined to equilibrium states .",
    "linear irreversible thermodynamics is an extension of the 19th century concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics to systems that are sufficiently close to equilibrium that intensive thermodynamic variables can be approximated by the same functions of local state variables , as would be the case if the entire system was in complete thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "moreover these traditional concepts are limited in application to large systems or averages over an ensemble of states , referred to as the  thermodynamic limit \" .",
    "inventors and engineers endeavour to scale down machines and devices to nanometer sizes for a wide range of technological purposes .",
    "however , there is a fundamental limit to miniaturisation since small engines are _ not _ simply re - scaled versions of their larger counterparts .",
    "if the work performed during the duty cycle of any machine is comparable to thermal energy per degree of freedom , then one can expect that the machine will operate in  reverse \" over short time scales .",
    "that is , heat energy from the surroundings will be converted into useful work allowing the engine to run backwards . for larger engines , we would describe this as a violation of the second law of thermodynamics , as entropy is consumed rather than generated . until recently ,",
    "this received little attention in the nanotechnology literature , as there was no theory capable of describing the probability of entropy consumption in such small engines .",
    "in the last fifteen years , several fluctuation theorems have been proposed that revolutionise our understanding and use of thermodynamics .",
    "firstly these new theorems lift the requirement of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this allows thermodynamic concepts to be applied to finite , even small systems .",
    "secondly , these new theorems can be applied to systems that are arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "thirdly for the first time , these theorems explain how macroscopic irreversibility appears naturally in systems that obey time reversible microscopic dynamics .",
    "resolution of the loschmidt ( irreversibility ) paradox had defied our best efforts for more than 100 years .",
    "one of these fluctuation theorems , the evans - searles fluctuation theorem ( evans - searles ft ) @xcite , results in a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics so that it applies to small systems , including those that evolve far from equilibrium .",
    "another , the crooks fluctuation theorem ( crooks ft ) @xcite provides a method of predicting equilibrium free energy difference from experimental information taken from nonequilibrium paths that connect two equilibrium states .",
    "this ft can be used to derive the well known jarzynski equality @xcite , which expresses the free energy difference between two equilibrium states in terms of an average over _ irreversible _ paths .",
    "both fts are at odds with a traditional understanding of 19th century thermodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , these theorems will be essential for the application of thermodynamic concepts to nanotechnology systems which are currently of such interest to biologists , physical scientists and engineers .      in many areas of physical chemistry ,",
    "researchers strive to understand new systems through deterministic equations of motion .",
    "they seek to quantify microscopic forces and understand how a system responds to external perturbations , using techniques such as molecular dynamics simulation . at the heart of this endeavour",
    "is the notion that if the equations of motion or trajectories of the system are known , then any question about that system may be answered . however , such deterministic equations ( such as newton s equations ) are time - reversible , so that for every trajectory there exists a conjugate , time - reversed trajectory or  anti - trajectory \" which is also a solution to the equations . the relative probabilities of observing bundles of conjugate trajectories can be used to quantify the  macroscopic reversibility \" of the system : if the probability of observing all trajectories and their respective anti - trajectories are equal , the system is said to be reversible ; on the other hand , if the probability of observing anti - trajectories is vanishingly small , we say that the system is irreversible .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics stipulates that a system evolves irreversibly in one  time - forward \" direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the probability of all anti - trajectories is zero . however , the second law strictly applies to large systems or over long time scales and does not describe the reversibility of small systems that are of current scientific interest , such as protein motors and nano - machines .",
    "this long - standing question of how irreversible macroscopic equations , as summarised by the second law of thermodynamics , can be derived from reversible microscopic equations of motion was first noted by loschmidt@xcite in 1876 and has been a paradox since then .",
    "boltzmann and his successors have simply side - stepped this issue with boltzmann stating  as soon as one looks at bodies of such small dimension that they contain only very few molecules , the validity of this theorem [ the second law of thermodynamics ] must cease \" @xcite    the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) of evans & searles @xcite describes how a finite sized system s irreversibility develops in time from a completely time - reversible system at short observation times , to an irreversible one at long times .",
    "it also shows how irreversibility emerges as the system size increases .",
    "that is , it bridges the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions , relating a system s time - reversible equations of motion to the second law , and provides a quantitative resolution to the long - standing irreversibility paradox .",
    "specifically , the ft relates the relative probabilities , @xmath0 , of observing trajectories of duration @xmath1 characterised by the dissipation function , @xmath2 , taking on arbitrary values @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively : @xmath5 it is an expression that describes the asymmetry in the distribution of @xmath2 over a particular ensemble of trajectories .",
    "the dissipation function , @xmath2 , is , in general , a dimensionless dissipated energy , accumulated along the system s trajectory ; expressions for @xmath2 differ from system to system .",
    "however , any trajectory of the system that is characterised by a particular value @xmath6 has , under time - reversible mechanics , a conjugate or time - reversed anti - trajectory with @xmath7 . in this way , the lhs of the ft has also been interpreted as a ratio of the probabilities of observing trajectories to their respective anti - trajectories .",
    "the dissipation function , @xmath2 , is an extensive property , _",
    "i.e. _ , its magnitude scales with system size , and it also scales with the observation time , @xmath1 .",
    "thus , eqn  [ eqn : ft ] also shows that as the system size gets larger or the observation time gets longer , anti - trajectories become rare and it becomes overwhelmingly likely that the system appears time - irreversible , in accord with the second law .",
    "that is , the evolution of a large macroscopic system proceeds preferentially in one direction .",
    "in addition , eqn  [ eqn : ft ] also shows that the ensemble average of the dissipation function is positive for all @xmath1 for all nonequilibrium systems and for any system size ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath8 , @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this as the second law inequality .      from classical thermodynamics ,",
    "the work done by an external field to drive a system from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state is equivalent to the change of free energy , @xmath9 , between the states , only in the special case where the path is traversed quasi - statically .",
    "that is the path between the two states must be traversed so slowly that intermediate , as well as the initial and final states of the system , are all in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "crooks fluctuation theorem ( crooks ft ) @xcite states something quite remarkable . in the case of paths that are traversed at arbitrary rate , ranging from quasi - static to  far - from - equilibrium \" , the distribution of trajectories , characterised by the work done by the external field over the duration of the trajectory , follows @xmath10}. \\label{eqn : crooks}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath13 is the initial temperature of the system on which the external field does work , or equivalently the temperature of the surroundings with which the system is initially at equilibrium .",
    "this expression is similar to evans - searles ft in that it relates distributions of trajectories , characterised by an energy , specifically the work , @xmath14 .",
    "while eqn  [ eqn : ft ] describes the asymmetry in the distribution of trajectories starting from the same initial distribution , crooks ft , eqn  [ eqn : crooks ] , relates trajectories initiated from two different equilibrium states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "that is , it considers ( i ) a distribution , @xmath17 , of _ forward _ trajectories , @xmath18 , where the free energy change between equilibrium states a and b is @xmath19 , and ( ii ) the distribution , @xmath20 of _ reverse _ trajectories , @xmath21 where the respective equilibrium free energy change is @xmath22 . like the ft ,",
    "crooks ft also quantifies how irreversibility evolves out of reversible equations of motion .",
    "a perfectly reversible ( quasi - static ) system is one where the work required to traverse @xmath23 is equal but opposite in sign to the work required in the time - reversed trajectory , @xmath18 .",
    "thus the rhs of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : crooks ] is unity for these reversible paths and @xmath24 , in agreement with classical thermodynamics .",
    "taking the ensemble average of @xmath25 and using the crooks ft gives , @xmath26 here the notation @xmath27 implies an ensemble average using the distribution function of state a , and the work is measure over forward trajectories @xmath18 . this expression",
    "was first posed by jarzynski in 1997 @xcite before eqn  [ eqn : crooks ] was discovered , and is known as the jarzynski equality . it states that the free energy can be determined by measuring the work , @xmath14 , done by an external field along dynamical paths that connect the two states .",
    "these forward paths may be traversed _ at arbitrary rates _ , so that the intervening states may not be in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this provides a completely new way of treating thermodynamics .",
    "if instead of averaging the work , you average the exponential of the work , then you can calculate the equilibrium free energy difference from information obtained along _ nonequilibrium _ paths .",
    "on the practical side , eqn  [ eqn : jarzynksi ] , suggests that measuring work on small microscopic processes could yield thermodynamic quantities @xmath9 that are traditionally inferred by calorimetric measurements .",
    "the importance here is that in order to understand molecular - scale processes , it is necessary to probe them using molecular time / length scales .      in the following section we will introduce some background concepts required for understanding the derivation and consequences of the fts .",
    "we introduce general equations of motion for nonequilibrium systems and give expressions for the work and heat transferred from the systems .",
    "we discuss how thermostatting is achieved in simulations , and in particular discuss the thermostatting mechanisms that produce a canonical equilibrium distribution , since it is the canonical state that was originally treated in the crooks ft . in section 3",
    "we review the concepts of the original ft derivation made by evans and searles for systems governed by deterministic mechanics . today , many proofs exist for the fts , extending to systems described by quantum , _ e.g. _ @xcite and stochastic dynamics _ e.g. _ @xcite . here",
    "we limit our review to the original deterministic treatment and to concepts central to the understanding the ft in the context of modern statistical mechanics and its applications .",
    "we extend this description to provide a derivation of the crooks ft for deterministic systems so as to demonstrate the similar basis it has with the evans - searles ft , and we refer collectively to these as the fts .",
    "these derivations consider the response of equilibrium systems to external perturbations .",
    "however , we also show how steady state fluctuation relations can be derived for systems that approach a unique steady state , and in those cases , how the fts can be used to obtain einstein and green - kubo relations . in section 4",
    "we review applications of the fts to experimental and model systems .",
    "the degrees of freedom for a system of particles can be the represented by the vectors of time - dependent generalized coordinates , @xmath28 , and momenta , @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , a single point in the system s phase - space is denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "consider a closed system that is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir . from equilibrium statistical mechanics , we know that the equilibrium probability distribution of the system is given by the canonical distribution function , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the equilibrium partition function , and @xmath33 is the internal energy is the phase - variable corresponding to the internal energy . for simplicity , we will use the term  internal energy \" to refer to @xmath33 , and will refer to the thermodynamic internal energy @xmath34 as the ",
    "mean internal energy \" .",
    "] which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies , @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the system .",
    "adiabatic _ system can exchange energy with its environment in the form of work .",
    "we can think of work as the form of energy exchange that is directly controllable by the environment .",
    "for example , it might be desirable to change the mean internal energy , @xmath37 of the system , and this can be achieved by externally controlling some parameter @xmath38 in the potential energy function of the system , @xmath39 .",
    "examples of such @xmath38-parameters include the switch on an externally applied electric field in a crystalline salt , the trapping constant in an optical trap holding a colloidal particle , or a mathematical agent that changes the size of lennard - jones spheres in a computer simulation .",
    "we emphasise this mode of external control by formally making @xmath38 time - dependent and by writing the internal energy as @xmath40 when an external agent does work on a system without changing its underlying equilibrium state , which has mean internal energy @xmath41 , we refer to that field as a purely dissipative field , denoting it generally by @xmath42",
    ". this dissipative field does not figure in the underlying equilibrium distribution or partition function , but drives the system away from equilibrium . while it may be possible to represent the external agent using either @xmath42 or @xmath38",
    ", we choose the convention that if @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the system will always relax to an ( nondissipative ) equilibrium state , and that if @xmath45 , the system will never relax to a nondissipative state .",
    "this distinction may depend on the state of system ( _ e.g. , _ fluid or solid ) . examples of such dissipative fields include a fluid under a shear flow , dragging a colloidal particle in a fluid , and an electric field acting on a molten salt . under adiabatic conditions ( _ i.e. _ the rate of heat exchange with the reservoir is @xmath46 ) , the combined action of both kinds of external agents , _",
    "i.e. , _ a time dependent potential represented by a @xmath38-parameter and a dissipative field @xmath42 , results in the equations of motion , @xmath47 with @xmath48 given by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fullham ] . is a  force \" , and",
    "neither does it have to always be a vector .",
    "for example , it could be a second order tensor , such as the velocity gradient tensor in a fluid .",
    "the coupling tensors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions of @xmath51 and have no explicit time - dependence , and are formally one tensorial order higher than @xmath42 . ]    for an externally driven adiabatic system , the rate of increase of @xmath33 must be identically equal to the rate of work @xmath52 done on the system by the environment .",

    "moreover , in most applications of interest , such systems typically function in an environment of constant temperature .",

    "several other mathematical constraints can be constructed , all of which may be argued to be  artificial \" .",
    "we will discuss the implications of such artificial thermostats , and the constraints they must satisfy shortly .",
    "as the system is closed , an increase in the internal energy must equal the sum of work done on the system by the environment and the heat added to the system by the thermostat .",
    "however , it is clear that the functional form of the expression for the rate of work must still be given by the relation in eqn .",

    "one of the most important consequences of the evans - searles ft is that it shows how macroscopic irreversibility can eventuate from microscopically reversible equations of motion . as described above",
    ", the systems we are considering are microscopically time - reversible .",
    "the evans - searles ft defines the variable @xmath2 which is a time - averaged phase variable and is zero for all initial phases if the system is macroscopically reversible , but will be non - zero for some initial conditions if it is macroscopically irreversible .",
    "furthermore , the evans - searles ft shows that @xmath145 for any ergodically consistent , microscopically time - reversible system , and only zero if the system is at equilibrium .",
    "the significance of the evans - searles ft has been discussed in @xcite , and other features are discussed in sections 3.4 below    however , where does the irreversibility come from ? in obtaining the evans - searles ft , it is assumed that the initial distribution function is known and then , typically , the response of this system to a field , @xmath42 , or variation of @xmath38 is considered .",

    "these are sufficient conditions for the crooks ft to be valid , but the condition of reversibility can be relaxed to some degree , and stochastic versions this ft exist .",
    "thus far , we have focused upon fts that apply to a system driven out of an initial equilibrium state by an external field , characterised by @xmath42 , or a parametric change in the potential characterised by @xmath182 .",
    "indeed , the evans - searles ft applied to systems driven from a known initial state over transient trajectories , is often referred to as the transient fluctuation theorem ( tft ) . however , according to the derivations of the evans - searles ft , the initial phase - space distribution is not restricted to time - invariant or even equilibrium distributions .",
    "the only requirement the evans - searles ft places on the initial distribution function is that it is known and expressible in the ostensible dimension of the equations of motion ( this is not the case for crooks ft ) .",
    "here we consider the fts applied to trajectories under a steady - state ; _ i.e. _ , the system is acted upon by a purely dissipative , constant external field , @xmath42 .",
    "there are two steady - sate fluctuation theorems ( ssfts ) that appear in the literature .",
    "both can be traced back to the original paper on fts @xcite that focused upon isoenergetic equations of motion ; but it is only later that two separate theorems were distinguished : ( i ) the steady - state version of the evans - searles ft @xcite and ( ii ) the gallavotti - cohen ft @xcite .",
    "in its simplest formulation , the ssft of evans & searles involves a rearranged from of eqn  [ eqn : ft ] applied in the long time limit to trajectories of a system wholly in a nonequilibrium steady - state ; _ i.e. _ the distribution function is time - invariant . a more complete derivation of the ssft valid under conditions including the decay of correlations is available @xcite ; however here we provide a simpler presentation that is physically compelling , and suitable for those primarily interested in a scientific justification .",
    "the argument of the evans - searles ft , applied to the steady state is @xmath183}\\nonumber\\\\ & = &   \\ln{\\bigg[\\frac{f^{ss}({\\bf \\gamma}_0,0)}{f^{ss}({\\bf \\gamma}^\\ast_t,0)}\\bigg]}-\\int_0^t\\lambda({\\bf \\gamma}_s , s)ds \\label{eqn : omegass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is now the phase - space distribution function associated with a steady - state , rather than with an equilibrium state ( as in the evans - searles ft applied to transient trajectories ) .",
    "however , typically this definition of @xmath185 is difficult to to implement .",
    "firstly , steady - state distribution functions for the types of deterministic dynamics under consideration are not generally known .",
    "what is known is that , in the steady - state , the dynamics approach a strange attractor that has a different fractal dimension to the ostensible phase space .",
    "even if we knew the details of this attractor , it would still be difficult to apply the evans - searles ft as it describes bundles of phase - space trajectories in the phase - space dimension and not in the dimension of the strange attractor .",
    "note however , that there are special cases where these steady - state distribution functions can be expressed simply and exactly under stochastic equations of motion , and eqn [ eqn : ft ] may be applied @xcite .",
    "in general these steady - state distribution functions are not known , and consequently , it is not possible to construct exact expressions for @xmath185 for deterministic trajectory segments of duration @xmath1 that are wholly at a nonequilibrium steady - state .",
    "however an approximate steady - state dissipation function can be constructed from trajectories initiated at a known equilibrium , in the absence of the dissipative field , @xmath42 .",
    "this distribution function is often referred to as the kawasaki distribution function @xcite , and can be considered to form the basis of the formal proof@xcite . at time @xmath186 , the dissipative field is introduced , and we can express @xmath2 associated with this trajectory in terms of its instantaneous rate of change , @xmath187 at time @xmath78 : @xmath188 here , @xmath189 is some arbitrary long time , say several maxwell times , so that the fluid has completely relaxed into a steady - state .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is cast as a sum of transient and steady - state contributions with the steady - state contribution , identified as the steady - state dissipation function , @xmath185 , used to approximate @xmath2 with an error or order @xmath190 .",
    "it is instructive to express these dissipation functions as time - averages , @xmath191 such that @xmath192 we make the physically compelling argument that , in the long time limit , the distribution function for steady - state trajectories will asymptotically converge to that for the full transient trajectories : @xmath193    however , the fluctuations in @xmath194 also vanish in the long time limit , and , in order that the ssft be of any importance , it is necessary that these fluctuations vanish more slowly than @xmath195 , the error in the @xmath194 approximation . to argue that this is the case , we re - express @xmath194 as a sum over contiguous trajectory segments of duration @xmath196 : @xmath197 if @xmath196 is larger than the longest correlation time in the system , then the sum @xmath198 is composed of independent segments and the variance in the sum is proportional to the number of segments or @xmath199 .",
    "the factor @xmath200 in front of the sum decreases the variance of the sum by a factor @xmath201 .",
    "thus , the standard deviation of the steady state dissipation function , @xmath202 , along a steady - state portion of a trajectory is inversely proportional to @xmath203 , and decays at a slower rate than that of the error in the approximation of @xmath204 with @xmath202 .",
    "consequently , we can approximate @xmath204 in the ft , eqn [ eqn : ft ] , with the steady - state dissipation function @xmath205 , leading to the ssft @xmath206      the fluctuation relation of the gallavotti - cohen ft can be written @xmath207 where the average phase space compression factor ( or the divergence of the flow ) , measured in the steady state , is given as@xmath208 the original proposal of this ft @xcite was made for the special case of isoenergetic dynamics , for which @xmath209 .",
    "however , subsequently the work of gallavotti and cohen @xcite strongly suggests that under appropriate conditions eqn  [ eq : gcft ] ( and with a restriction on the values of @xmath210 @xcite is restricted to values of @xmath15 bounded by a value @xmath211 : @xmath212 . in the small field limit this value",
    "is given to leading order as @xmath213 @xcite . ] ) can be applied to a larger class of dynamical systems ( e.g. constant temperature systems ) .",
    "they arrived at eqn   [ eq : gcft ] through a formal derivation @xcite , which drew upon the sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measure ( for a discussion see @xcite ) , which requires the dynamics to be an anosov diffeomorphism @xcite .",
    "a necessary but insufficient condition for this is that the dynamical system must be hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "this means that the number of expanding and contracting directions on the attractive set must be equal , or in other words the number of positive and negative finite time lyapunov exponents must be equal and no zero exponents are allowed . in general , the equations of motion , eqn [ eqn : fulleom ] , do not form an anosov diffeomorphism . to address this",
    "gallavotti and cohen introduced a new hypothesis , termed the chaotic hypothesis @xcite , , of a many - particle system can be regarded as a mixing anosov map . '' in @xcite the term `` transitive anosov map '' was used to mean `` mixing anosov map '' . ]",
    "which , for the purposes of the gallavotti - cohen ft , allows many - body dynamics to be treated as an anosov diffeomorphism .",
    "unfortunately , as yet , there is no way to independently ascertain if a physical system may be treated as anosov diffeomorphic .",
    "the requirements for the valid application of the gallavotti - cohen ft to physical systems are therefore extremely difficult to establish .",
    "there is a large body of computer simulation results , for various processes , that have tested the steady state fluctuation theorems , e.g. @xcite , .",
    "we known of no case for which the gallavotti - cohen ft converges faster than the evans - searles ft . for temperature regulated dynamics ,",
    "when the dissipative field strength is very small , the gallavotti - cohen ft can take extremely long times to converge .",
    "indeed as the dissipative field strength approaches zero the amount of time it takes the gallavotti - cohen ft to converge diverges @xcite . to understand this",
    "consider the arguments of the evans - searles ft and the gallavotti - cohen ft .",
    "when the field strength approaches zero so does the instantaneous dissipation function .",
    "more precisely the average value of the instantaneous dissipation function , to leading order , is @xmath214 , and the standard deviation is @xmath215 .",
    "for the phase space compression factor , the mean is @xmath216 and the standard deviation is @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the amplitude of the standard deviation at equilibrium .",
    "the difference between the behaviour in the amplitude of the fluctuations , @xmath219 , for these two quantities is crucial . as @xmath220 approaches zero so to does the amplitude of the fluctuations in @xmath221 but not those in @xmath88 . now",
    "the form of the fluctuation formulae is asymmetric . in the limit @xmath222 ,",
    "eqn [ eqn : ssft ] ( the ssft ) remains consistent with a given trajectory segment being equally likely to occur as its anti - trajectory segment .",
    "this is a necessary condition for equilibrium .",
    "in contrast eqn [ eq : gcft ] ( the gallavotti - cohen ft ) is not consistent with this , due to the fluctuations in @xmath88 remaining finite when @xmath222 .",
    "one way this could be resolved is for the time averaging , or the time for which the gallavotti - cohen ft is given to converge , to be so long that there are no significant fluctuations remaining .",
    "however it is specified by the theory @xcite that the largest fluctuations for which the gallavotti - cohen ft may be validly applied vanishes in the small field limit .",
    "the evans - searles fluctuation theorem , as well as crooks fluctuation theorem have been reviewed here as recent theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "here we show that the fts , and in particular the evans - searles ft , is completely consistent with the long - standing and well - known relations in the field , namely the einstein - sutherland relation @xcite and the green - kubo relations .",
    "the einstein - sutherland relation dates back to the very early days of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ; it can be written as @xmath223 this important relation describes the average steady - state velocity of a particle , @xmath224 , under an applied field , @xmath42 , to the variance in the particle s displacement over time in the absence of the field , which is commonly referred to as the diffusion constant , @xmath225 , where @xmath226 .",
    "starting from the evans - searles ft , we reformulate a generalised form of this einstein - sutherland relation , and from that , the green - kubo relations .",
    "while this does not produce new results , it demonstrates the fts consistency with important existing theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , and it also emphasises / clarifies the conditions necessary for the application of these theories , as we show later , in the case of supercooled liquids .    to derive the more generalised version of the einstein - sutherland relation , eqn [ eq : gk - suthe ] , from the ft , we first need to identify the product of the particles drift velocity and the applied field , @xmath227 , as a specific example of a dissipative field flux , that we have represented by @xmath228 , which , in the case of the flux and constant field being in the same direction , we write more simply as @xmath229 . under steady - state",
    ", the time - averaged dissipative flux is defined as @xmath230 where @xmath189 is a time long enough after the application of the field so that the system is at a steady - state . the steady - state fluctuation theorem , eqn [ eqn : ssft ] ,",
    "may then be written as @xmath231 in the limit of long time , we may invoke the central limit theorem , which states that close to the mean the distribution of @xmath232 will be gaussian . additionally in the limit of small field strength , values of @xmath233 close to the mean will dominate : @xmath234 now as the variance in the distribution of @xmath233 is independent of the field direction or sign of @xmath235 , then , to leading order in @xmath236 , the variance behaves as @xmath237 the ssft , eqn [ eq : gk - ssft ] , the central limit theorem eqn [ eq : gk - gauss ] and eqn [ eq : gk - variance ] combine to give a generalised einstein - sutherland relation : @xmath238    it is generally known that the einstein - sutherland relation is only valid to linear order in the field , @xmath235 .",
    "however , the ft provides more detailed understanding of how this relation fails under large fields .",
    "when the field is increased , the mean dissipative flux , @xmath239 will also increase , figure  [ fig : gaussian ] .",
    "when the mean is large relative to the standard deviation , then for every typical value of the flux @xmath240 , its conjugate value @xmath241 in the ssft will be represented in the wings of the distribution where the central limit theorem no longer applies . in this instance , the generalised einstein - sutherland relation is invalid , even if the equilibrium variance @xmath242 is replaced with the variance under steady - state , or @xmath243 .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of planar shear have shown that the breakdown of the central limit theorem dominates over the approximation of ignoring terms of @xmath244 or higher in the variance that describes the distribution near its mean .",
    "@xcite . in the case of a single ,",
    "tagged particle , interacting with a constant field , and embedded in a supercooled liquid , the amount of time it takes for the the steady - state ft to converge as well as the the time it takes for the distribution to become gaussian , increases rapidly upon approach to the glass transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , the variance decreases with time .",
    "as this time increases the variance decreases inversely proportionally . as the nominal glass transition is approached the strongest field for which a linear response may be observed in the steady state , vanishes .",
    "the variance of the flux may be expressed in terms of the integral,@xmath245 in the long time limit , the second term on the rhs vanishes and @xmath246 combing this with the generalised einstein - sutherland relation , eqn [ eq : gk - gen - einstein ] , gives the celebrated green - kubo theory for steady - state : @xmath247 it can be used to obtain a transport coefficient in terms of equilibrium fluctuations in the form of an autocorrelation function .",
    "one might wonder why the green - kubo theory holds such important status given that the presentation here shows it to be equivalent to the einstein - sutherland relation .",
    "in contrast to the einstein - sutherland relation the green - kubo theory is also applicable to time dependent phenomena .",
    "a time dependent version of the green - kubo theory can not be obtained from the ft which must satisfy definite time parity conditions .",
    "an example of where the ft has been used is couette flow or planar shear @xcite using the sllod equations of motion@xcite , which in the absence of a fictitious thermostat and for the case of constant shear rate @xmath248 , are equivalent to newtons equations of motion .",
    "as we are controlling the shear rate externally we identify it as the external field @xmath249 and the flux as @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the @xmath252 element of the pressure tensor .",
    "the dissipative field or entropy production for couette flow is then @xmath253 the shear viscosity @xmath254 is the rate at which work is being done on the fluid divided by the product of the volume and the shear rate squared .",
    "the green kubo expression for the viscosity is thus @xmath255 and the einstein - sutherland expression is @xmath256 if the system is very viscous , the green - kubo expression , eqn [ eq : gk - viscosity - gk ] , will require a long time to converge and consequently , the generalised einstein - sutherland expression , eqn [ eq : gk - viscosity - einst ] , will probably be the better method to extract the viscosity in such a situation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if we wish to calculate the self - diffusion coefficient for a very viscous system , the einstein - sutherland expression for the diffusion @xmath257 , can be very slow to converge while the green kubo expression , @xmath258 , will usually converge quite rapidly @xcite .",
    "much of the work done in developing and extending the fluctuation theorems was accomplished by theoreticians and mathematicians interested in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . until 2002 ,",
    "demonstrations of the theorems were limited to computer simulations and there were no practical experimental demonstrations of the theorems , despite the range of interests in nano / micro machines , or molecular devices that impose nanometer scale displacements with piconetwon scale forces .",
    "such small machines include single biomolecules that act as molecular motors and whose experimental observation highlight the nonequilibrium phenomena described by the fts .",
    "linear motors , such as the action - myosin or the kinesin - microtubule motor are fuelled by proton currents or atp hydrolysis and function as integral parts of cellular metabolism , and consequently , they work under inherently nonequilibrium conditions@xcite . over time , on average , these molecular engines must not violate the second law ; however occasionally they run  backwards \" , converting heat from the surroundings to generate useful mechanical / chemical energy .",
    "this work , done on the molecular time and length scales , will have a natural variation or spread of values , and the conjecture is that this is governed by the fts .    in 2002",
    "the fts were demonstrated experimentally by two independent groups , each with a unique focus and both using optical tweezers .",

    "an optical trap is formed when a transparent , micron - sized particle , whose index of refraction is greater than that of the surrounding medium , is located within a focused laser beam .",

    "as there is no change in state of the underlying state of the system , and the field has even time - parity , the evans - searles ft and the crooks ft reduce to the same expression and equivalently describe the distributions of @xmath268 we expect , from the second law , that work is done to translate the particle - filled optical trap , or @xmath269 , but according to the fts there should also be a nonvanishing probability of observing short trajectories where @xmath270 , that is thermal fluctuations _ provide _ the work . indeed ,",

    "work is the change in the internal energy that occurs with the change in the trapping constant : @xmath281 note that @xmath14 will always be positive if the trap strength is @xmath282 and consequently , distributions for @xmath14 can not be gaussian . as all trajectories must initiate under equilibrium conditions under @xmath274 ,",

    "furthermore , if we consider the probability distribution of @xmath14 for both the _ forward _ or capture direction , and the _ reverse _ or release direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath287 , @xmath288},\\ ] ] it is straightforward to show that these distributions trivially obey crooks ft .",
    "notice that in the context of the capture experiment , crooks ft depends only upon the equilibrium distribution of initial particle distribution : these equilibrium distributions are independent of , for example , the viscoelastic response of the suspending fluid .",
    "an alternative experiment , say where the trapping constant changes linearly over some time period is different ; there @xmath14 is accumulated over the time period over which @xmath261 is changing and the distribution of @xmath14 depends upon the response or microrheology of the fluid .",
    "in contrast , the dissipation function , @xmath2 depends sensitively upon the non - equilibrium trajectory , and upon the material properties of the surrounding fluid @xcite .",
    "the dissipation function is then @xmath289 = \\frac{k_0-k_1}{2}({\\bf r}^2_t - { \\bf r}^2_0).\\ ] ] notice that if we consider a cyclic protocol where the external field had even time - parity , _ i.e. _ @xmath290 , that is , we would  capture \" at @xmath74 and  release \" at @xmath186 , then @xmath291 , and the evans - searles and crooks fts would again reduce to the same expression .",
    "these experiments were simple , but important demonstrations of the fts .",
    "these experiments can also be related to fluctuation theorems derived under stochastic equations motion , a topic not covered in this review .",
    "the motion of a single colloidal particle in a purely viscous solvent is accurately described by a stochastic langevin equation ; _ i.e. _ , the degrees of freedom of the solvent molecules are integrated over the timescale of the colloidal particles motion to yield a friction coefficient and uncorrelated gaussian noise . as demonstrated by wang _",
    "et al _ @xcite , from the stochastic , inertialess langevin equation of motion , you can construct the evans - searles ft in much the same manner as was done for deterministic dynamics .",
    "this is important evidence against the notion that macroscopic irreversibility is due to the coarse - graining or separation of time - scales of the system s degrees of freedom : for the optically - trapped particles , both langevin equations of motion as well as fictitious thermostatted deterministic equations ( md ) showed the monotonic decrease in @xmath2 as the trajectories evolved in time . on the other hand ,",
    "if a system s dynamics are well described by stochastic langevin dynamics , with uncorrelated gaussian noise , then we are assured that the fts will hold . indeed , several simple model experiments , including optically trapped colloidal particles in purely viscous media , can be described using stochastic langevin dynamics and consequently one could argue that these experiments confirm the langevin dynamics rather than the fts .",
    "however more recently , carberry_et al _ , confirmed the ft using an optically trapped bead in a viscoelastic solvent , where the stochastic equations of motion require a dissipative term with memory , from which the fts have yet to be directly derived .",
    "this experimental confirmation is indeed a confirmation of the fts , rather than a confirmation of the dynamics that satisfy the fts .      in 2002",
    "et al _ @xcite measured the tension - induced , unfolding transition of a p5abs domain in a single rna molecule . to do this",
    "they tethered the ends of a single dna - rna hybrid molecule containing the p5abc domain to micron - sized colloidal beads whose surfaces were chemically functionalised .",
    "these beads act as `` handles '' to grab and manipulate the single molecule in an optical trap .",
    "one bead is weakly held in an optical trap while the other bead is held in a micropipette whose position / translational speed is controlled by a piezoelectric actuator . as the micropipette is translated relative to the optical trap , the chain is stretched and the tension in the chain is determined by the optical force , @xmath292 acting on the bead in the trap . in this way ,",
    "liphardt _ et al _ constructed force - extension profiles of a single biomolecule , focussing specifically on a window of extensions over which the p5abs domain unfolded . over a @xmath293 m extension range",
    ", they found that , typically , the force increased monotonically against the entropic elasticity of the chain s contour , but at @xmath294pn the force was either constant or decreased slightly for a further @xmath295 m indicative of unfolding of the domain , before increasing monotonically again .",
    "the time - reverse path corresponds to retraction of the chain ends , creating the same force - extension profile for the re - folding of the domain . when the chain was unfolded slowly ( corresponding to small @xmath296 ) , the folding - unfolding processes were reversible , i.e. , the work done ( force integrated over extension ) of the forward ( unfolding ) and reverse ( re - folding ) paths were roughly equal but of opposite sign .",
    "when the chain was unfolded quickly , a hysteresis loop appeared in the forward - reverse force profile and the @xmath14 to fold and unfold differed in magnitude , due to the macroscopic irreversibility .",
    "theoretically , the distributions @xmath297 and @xmath298 at any given protocol or stretching rate , @xmath296 , should obey crooks ft : however , it is clear that variation in @xmath14 due to experimental error or approximations in analysis must be minimal in comparison to the inherent variation in @xmath14 that arises from the irreversibility of the process . furthermore , it is important to experimentally sample a sufficient number of trajectories , @xmath103 : as the protocol rate , @xmath296 , increases and the process is driven further away from a quasi - static or equilibrium process , the required number @xmath103 grows as  rare \" trajectories in the distribution become important as explained in figure  [ fig : crookrv ] .",
    "successive single molecule manipulations in an optical trap can be difficult , limiting the maximum possible number of trajectories .",
    "however , liphardt _ et al _ constructed @xmath299 stretching profiles , unfortunately an insufficient number to describe the distributions , but fortunately sufficient to the show that @xmath9 obtained from jarzynski s equality could be determined to within @xmath267 from their @xmath103 experimental trajectories . in",
    "later work from the same group , collin _",
    "et al_@xcite similarly used optical tweezers to construct experimental work distributions and demonstrate crooks ft for the folding / unfolding of an rna hairpin and an rna three - helix junction .",
    "these results demonstrate that nonequilibrium single molecule measurements , when analysed in conjunction with the fts can provide thermodynamic information , even though these single - molecule events may not be at equilibrium .",
    "more importantly , these papers introduced to the single - molecule force spectroscopist , a proper analysis / interpretation of force measurements .",
    "several other more recent experimental demonstrations of the fts have appeared in the literature in the last couple of years .",
    "garnier and ciliberto @xcite demonstrated the fts by measuring the fluctuating voltage of a resistor in parallel with a capacitor , driven out of equilibrium by a constant current flow ; schuler _ et al _ @xcite excited a single defect center in a diamond using an intensity - modulated laser , forming a two - state system ; and douarche _ et al _ @xcite , experimentally checked the jarzynski equality and crooks ft against the thermal fluctuations of a mechanical oscillator in contact with a heat reservoir .",
    "applications of the ft to model systems need not be experimental . to date",
    "the ft has been used in theoretical descriptions / computer simulations of sheared liquids _",
    "@xcite , chemical reactions @xcite molecular motors @xcite , granular gases @xcite , and glasses @xcite .",
    "finally , through its application to time - dependent shear of viscoelastic fluids , the ft has been used to resolve a long - standing problem in linear irreversible thermodynamics @xcite . the reference to @xmath300 as the entropy production is taken from linear irreversible thermodynamics , which asserts that , in local equilibrium , the entropy source strength is the sum of products of irreversible thermodynamic fluxes and forces @xcite . by the second law",
    "we then expect that @xmath301 is always negative .",
    "however for time dependent processes in viscoelastic fluids this is not always the case . in the steady - state",
    "the free energy @xmath302 , the mean internal energy @xmath41 , the temperature @xmath13 and the entropy @xmath303 will all be constant .",
    "in local equilibrium , where the entropy transported to the reservoir is given by @xmath304 , we have @xmath305 .",
    "this leads us directly to the conclusion that @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the rate at which entropy is being spontaneously produced , due to the external field @xmath220 .",
    "if we are not in the steady state or are not in local equilibrium we can not show that , @xmath308 .",
    "indeed for time dependent proccesses in viscoelastic fluids @xmath309 may be positive for periods of time . for a system initially in equilibrium , subject to a purely dissipative process , _ i.e. _ , @xmath310 , the time averaged value of the entropy production , rather than the more traditional instantaneous entropy production , can be shown from the jarzynski equality to form the inequality that specifies the time direction .",
    "this was demonstrated in simulations of time - dependent planar shear of viscoelastic fluids @xcite where the instantaneus value of @xmath309 was indeed shown to be negative for periods .",
    "furthermore , this inequality is valid for time dependent processes which may be arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "this review has focused on two important fundamental fluctuation relations , the evans - searles and the crooks fts , with some discussion on steady state fluctuation relations ( evans - searles ssft and the gallavotti - cohen ft ) and important relations that can be derived from these .",
    "the new understanding of thermodynamic reversibility that has been obtained from the fts has been described in detail , as has the determination of free energy differences between equilibrium states from study of nonequilibrium paths . in this context",
    "the jarzynski equality has been presented .    however , there is much work on fts that has not been covered in this review .",
    "the theoretical description above has focused on systems whose equilibrium equations of motion preserve a canonical distribution function .",
    "this requirement is not necessary , and the application of the evans - searles ft to a wide range of combinations of ensembles and dynamics is well known @xcite . furthermore , the crooks ft has been extended to allow treatment of other ensembles including constant pressure ensembles @xcite .",
    "granular systems @xcite and systems undergoing chemical reactions @xcite have also been studied .",
    "as discussed above , we have focused on deterministic derivations due to our interest in emergence of irreversibility from reversible equations of motion , however there has been extensive work on stochastic versions of the evans - searles ft ( see @xcite for early work in this regard ) , and it is straightforward to see that the requirement of microscopic reversibility is not essential in its derivation - existence of the reverse trajectory is sufficient .",
    "the original derivations of the crooks ft and the jarzynski equality used stochastic dynamics , and it is only more recently that derivations for deterministic systems have appeared @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , versions of fts applicable to quantum systems have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "fluctuation relations for phase variables other than the dissipation function can be straightforwardly obtained for those phase variables that are odd with respect to time reversal .",
    "these relations are more complex than the dissipation - function ft @xcite .",
    "local fluctuation relations have also be derived @xcite .",
    "finally , as the functional form of the dissipation function in the ft depends on the initial ensemble of the system , satisfaction of an ft that is derived assuming a particular distribution function provides evidence that the correct ensemble had been assumed .",
    "this has proved useful in the study of glasses @xcite .",
    "some experimental studies of the fts have been discussed .",
    "these have allowed confirmation of the relationships in real physical systems .",
