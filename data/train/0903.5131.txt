    "the effect of current - driven switching in magnetic junctions  @xcite attracts continuing attention because of possible using this phenomenon for high - density information processing .",
    "one of the most important problems is lowering the current density threshold corresponding to instability of the initial magnetic configuration and switching it to another one with different resistance .",
    "various ways have been proposed to solve the problem , namely , using magnetic semiconductors with their lower saturation magnetizations  @xcite , choosing the layer materials with proper spin resistances  @xcite , and so on . in this note",
    ", we consider an additional possibility of lowering the threshold current density corresponding to instability and switching the magnetic configuration of the magnetic junction .",
    "we consider a magnetic junction consisting of a pinned ferromagnetic layer 1 , free ferromagnetic layer 2 , an ultrathin spacer in between , and nonmagnetic layer 3 closing the electric circuit .",
    "the current flows perpendicular to the layer planes ( cpp mode ) .",
    "the free layer thickness  @xmath0 is assumed to be small in comparison with the spin diffusion length in that layer and the domain wall thickness . in such conditions ,",
    "the macrospin approximation  @xcite is applicable . in this approximation , the modified landau ",
    "gilbert ( llg ) equation contains additional terms describing two different mechanisms of the spin - polarized current influence on the magnetic lattice , namely , the spin torque transfer effect  @xcite and the spin injection effect  @xcite . the relative role of these mechanisms depends on the system parameters , specifically , the gilbert damping constant .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that with suitable choice of the layer spin resistances and not too small damping constant , the injection mechanism predominates over the spin torque transfer mechanism .",
    "such a situation is assumed below .",
    "we use a coordinate system with  @xmath1 axis along the current direction and  @xmath2 plane parallel to the layers plane .",
    "the easy axis of free layer 2 is parallel to  @xmath3 axis , while the easy axis of layer 1 is oriented at some angle with respect to  @xmath3 axis .",
    "when the spin injection predominates over the spin torque transfer , the llg equation has the first integral in form of a magnetic energy consisting of the zeeman energy , the anisotropy energy , the demagnetization energy , and the nonequilibrium _ sd _ exchange energy proportional to the spin - polarized current density  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic energy is a function of the angles determining orientation of the free layer magnetization with respect to the easy axis of the layer , the external magnetic field , and the pinned layer magnetization ( which is parallel to the easy axis of this layer ) .",
    "the angles depend on the current density because of the sd exchange interaction .",
    "the minima of the magnetic energy correspond to the stable equilibrium states .",
    "the switching occurs when the stable equilibrium state of the system disappears or converts to unstable one ( which corresponds to a maximum of the energy ) .",
    "we assume below that the spin resistance  @xcite of the free layer is much lower than the spin resistances of the pinned and nonmagnetic layers .    under assumptions",
    "mentioned , the ( dimensionless ) magnetic energy with the current direction corresponding to the electron flow from the pinned layer to the free one takes the form  @xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 here the following notations are used :  @xmath6 is the external magnetic field ,  @xmath7 is the anisotropy field of the free layer ,  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 angles determine directions of the free layer magnetization and the external magnetic field , respectively , reckoned from the free layer easy axis ( @xmath3 axis ) ,  @xmath10 is analogous angle for the pinned layer ,  @xmath11 is the dimensionless constant of _ sd _ exchange interaction ,  @xmath12 is the spin relaxation time ,  @xmath13 is the spin polarization of the pinned layer conductivity ,  @xmath14 is the bohr magneton ,    in absence of the magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) and the current ( @xmath16 ) , there are two stable configurations ,  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 . at  @xmath15 and  @xmath19 ,",
    "the antiparallel relative orientation of the ferromagnetic layers ( @xmath18 ) becomes unstable , and switching occurs to parallel configuration ( @xmath17 ) at  @xmath20 .",
    "the stability analysis shows that the instability occurs at lower threshold current density if the initial configuration is not collinear .",
    "the minimal threshold current density  @xmath21 takes place when the angle between the easy axes of the pinned and free layers is equal to  @xmath22 .",
    "and  @xmath23 denote magnetizations of the pinned and free layers , respectively . ]",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "let the pinned layer easy axis and the magnetization vector  @xmath24 be directed at the angle of  @xmath25 with respect to  @xmath3 axis , while the initial ( in absence of the current ) direction of the free layer magnetization corresponds to  @xmath18 . when the current through magnetic junction is turned on and increases , the magnetization vector  @xmath23 of layer 2 deviates from the initial direction . when the current density reaches value  @xmath26 , that vector takes the position  @xmath27 .",
    "at that moment , instability occurs and vector  @xmath23 abruptly turns to a new position  @xmath28 . at further increase in current , vector  @xmath23 tends to stand parallel to  @xmath24 .",
    "if the current is turns off , vector  @xmath23 takes the position  @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the switching of vector  @xmath23 is realized from  @xmath18 to  @xmath17 position with threshold current density  @xmath21 , half as much as the threshold for collinear configuration .",
    "if magnetic field  @xmath6 is applied along  @xmath24 vector , the threshold current density reveals further decrease to @xmath29 at  @xmath6 value close to but slightly less than the halved anisotropy field  @xmath30 , the instability threshold can be lowered considerably .",
    "note , that participation of the magnetic field does not prevent locality of the effect , because the magnetic field  @xmath31 can not do switching alone , without the current .",
    "the switching effect leads to change in resistance ; this is of the same origin as the well - known giant and tunnel magnetoresistance effects .",
    "the current density through a tunnel junction with  @xmath32 angle between the layer magnetizations is  @xcite @xmath33 where  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 are the current densities for parallel ( @xmath36 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath37 ) configurations , respectively . in the example considered ( @xmath25 ) ,",
    "@xmath38 angle is equal to  @xmath39 just before the switching and  @xmath40 just after the switching .",
    "therefore , the junction resistance relative change due to the switching is @xmath41 where  @xmath42 is the standard magnetoresistance ratio  @xcite corresponding to the switching from one collinear configuration to another ( opposite ) one",
    ".    the threshold of the switching by a magnetic field can be lower up to two times also when the field is applied at an angle to the easy axis of the layer , in comparison with the collinear configuration  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the field is of exchange nature , but the result is similar .",
    "it should have in mind , however , that the exchange switching , unlike the conventional switching by a magnetic field , is localized at the atomic level .",
    "this fact opens new practical possibilities .",
    "the calculations show that the threshold current density corresponding to switching the free layer magnetization to opposite direction can be lowered up to two times if the pinned layer of the junction is noncollinear with the easy axis of the free layer .",
    "such an effect allows varying conditions of experiments .    with more complex anisotropy",
    "when several easy axes present a many - level switching is possible in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this result to the exchange switching by a spin - polarized current is of great interest .",
