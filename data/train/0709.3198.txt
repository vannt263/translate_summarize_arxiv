    "<S> the temperatures of interstellar dust grains are analyzed using stochastic simulations , taking into account the grain composition and size and the discreteness of the photon flux . </S>",
    "<S> grains of radii smaller than about 0.02 @xmath0 m are found to exhibit large temperature fluctuations with narrow spikes following the absorption of uv photons . the temperatures of such grains may rise by a few @xmath1 10 k for very short times , but they do not rise above 80 k even for irradiation field intensities of photon dominated regions . the distribution of grain temperatures is calculated for a broad range of grain sizes and for different intensities of the interstellar radiation field , relevant to diffuse clouds and to photon dominated regions . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the average grain temperature on its size is shown for different irradiation intensities . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the average temperatures of grains with radii smaller than about 0.02 @xmath0 m are reduced due to the fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the average temperatures of grains of radii larger than about 0.35 @xmath0 m are also slightly reduced due to their more efficient emission of infrared radiation , particularly when exposed to high irradiation intensities . </S>",
    "<S> the average temperatures @xmath2 of silicate and carbonaceous grains are found to depend on the radiation field intensity @xmath3 according to @xmath4 , where the exponent @xmath5 depends on the grain size and composition . </S>",
    "<S> this fitting formula is expected to be useful in simulations of interstellar processes , and can replace commonly used approximations which do not account for the grain temperature fluctuations and for the detailed properties of interstellar dust particles . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of the results on molecular hydrogen formation are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that grain - temperature fluctuations tend to reduce the formation rate of molecular hydrogen , and can not account for the observations of h@xmath6 in photon - dominated regions , even in the presence of chemisorption sites .    </S>",
