    "events containing vector bosons and heavy - flavor jets constitute valuable data samples for a variety of physics analyses at both cdf and d0 experiments at the fermilab tevatron @xmath0 collider .",
    "for example , an event sample containing a @xmath1 boson and @xmath2-jet(s ) is a golden sample for the higgs search at low masses , studies of top quark production and properties , and also searches for the beyond - the - standard - model phenomena .",
    "thus , the measurements of cross sections for qcd production of vector boson + heavy - flavor jets are important not only to enhance our understanding of qcd but also to better understand the backgrounds to other important physics studies",
    ". presented below are recent measurements by the cdf and d0 experiments on these processes .",
    "r0.39    cdf has made a measurement of the @xmath3-jets cross section  @xcite using 1.9 fb@xmath4 of @xmath0 collision data at @xmath5 tev . the event sample used in this measurement",
    "is selected from the high @xmath6 electron and muon samples by requiring a reconstructed isolated electron with @xmath7 gev or muon with @xmath8 gev/_c _ , missing transverse energy ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 gev , and one or two jets with @xmath7 gev and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath2-jets are `` tagged '' by the presence of a displaced secondary vertex within the jet arising from the decay of the long - lived @xmath12 hadron .",
    "the @xmath2-tagged jet sample includes background contributions from charm and light - flavor ( lf ) jets .",
    "the fraction of @xmath2-jets in the @xmath2-tagged sample is estimated by performing a fit to the invariant mass of all charged tracks associated with the secondary vertex as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wb ] ; on average , @xmath2-jets have a larger mass than @xmath13-jets and lf jets due to the hierarchy of @xmath12 , @xmath14 and lf hadron masses .",
    "there are non - negligible contributions to @xmath3-jet candidates from processes other than qcd @xmath3 production .",
    "the largest background contribution comes from qcd multijet production in which there is no real @xmath15 , but a combination of jets faking leptons , mismeasured jet energy , or semileptonic @xmath2-decay make the events pass through all the event selections .",
    "the other major background sources are @xmath16 production and single top quark production .",
    "the qcd multijet production contribution is estimated using data , and the other background contributions are estimated from mc predictions .",
    "the cross section for @xmath2-jets with @xmath7 gev and @xmath11 from qcd @xmath3 production is measured to be @xmath17 which is higher than the alpgen prediction of 0.78 pb by @xmath18 .",
    "this large disagreement is somewhat unexpected and indicates a need for an improved theoretical prediction for this process .",
    "the @xmath19-jets production has been studied by both d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite .",
    "the dominant production diagrams contributing to the @xmath19-jets final state are ( a ) @xmath20 ( @xmath21% ) and ( b ) @xmath22 ( @xmath23% ) in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd predictions .",
    "the cross section is sensitive to the @xmath2-quark density in the proton , and thus the cross section measurement provides important information for the @xmath2-quark density which is so far indirectly extracted from gluon density .",
    "a good understanding of the @xmath2 density is essential to accurately predict the production of particles that couple strongly to @xmath2-quarks including supersymmetric higgs bosons and single top production .",
    "@xmath19-jets production is also a major background in searches for the higgs production in the @xmath24 channel .",
    "cdf has recently updated the measurement on @xmath19-jet production using 2.0 fb@xmath4 of data .",
    "the measurement was made using jets with @xmath7 gev and @xmath25 tagged as @xmath2-jets by the secondary vertex algorithm in @xmath26 and @xmath27 events and the results are summarized in table .",
    "[ tab : zb ] .",
    "the high statistics in the data used in the recent analysis also allowed the first measurement of differential distributions , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zb ] together with several theoretical predictions .",
    "the data are in general agreement with the data , but differences at the level of up to 2@xmath28 are observed .",
    "both alpgen and mcfm nlo predictions lie somewhat below the data at low jet @xmath29 ( @xmath30 @xmath6 ) , but agree better with data at higher jet @xmath29 ( @xmath30 @xmath6 ) .",
    "pythia is in good agreement with data at low jet @xmath29 , but less so at higher jet @xmath29 .",
    "large variations in theoretical predictions are not well understood and need to be resolved .",

    "@xmath31 events are produced by @xmath32 ( @xmath33% ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35% ) in the sm .",
    "thus , the production cross section is sensitive to the @xmath36-quark pdfs in the proton at a scale on the order of the @xmath15 mass , and it is also sensitive to the element of the ckm matrix @xmath37 .",
    "also , @xmath38 is an important component of the w+1 and 2 jet samples , that are used in searches for _ e.g. _ a single top , the higgs boson , and a supersymmetric top , and the searches will benefit from good understanding of qcd @xmath38 production .",
    "both cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite studied w+single @xmath13 production recently . in both measurements ,",
    "@xmath39 events are selected by requiring a high @xmath6 isolated electron or muon with large @xmath9 .",
    "charm jets are identified from their semileptonic decay by looking for a muon within the jet ; this charm jet identification algorithm is referred to as the soft lepton tagging ( slt ) algorithm .",
    "@xmath31 events are identified by utilizing the charge correlation between a lepton from @xmath15 decay ( @xmath15 lepton ) and slt muon , _",
    "i.e. _ , the difference between events in which the @xmath15 lepton and slt muon have opposite charge ( os ) and events in which they have same charge ( ss ) .",
    "the @xmath38 production mainly leads to os events ; however most of background processes such as the @xmath40 production give os and ss events almost equally .",
    "therefore , events from @xmath38 production can be extracted from the excess of os - ss events .",
    "r0.40    figure  [ fig : wc ] ( top ) shows the number of os - ss events as a function of slt muon @xmath6 measured by cdf , with an excess which is consistent with the presence of the @xmath38 production . after taking into account the os - ss events from backgronds , such as @xmath15+light - flavor jets , drell - yan , and qcd multijet production ,",
    "the cross section of the @xmath38 production for @xmath41 gev/_c _ and @xmath42 is measured to be @xmath43 pb which is in good agreement with the nlo pqcd prediction of @xmath44 pb .",
    "d0 measured the cross section ratio @xmath45 , since in the ratio many systematic uncertainties cancel .",
    "the measurment was made as a function of jet @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wc ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the cross section ratio integrated over @xmath46 gev/_c _ and @xmath47 is measured to be @xmath48 which is somewhat higher but consistent with the alpgen prediction of @xmath49 .",
    "final states containing a vector boson and heavy - flavor jets appear in many interesting physics processes .",
    "the good understanding of qcd production of such final states is critical for physics analyses at the tevatron and also at the upcoming lhc , and both cdf and d0 collaborations have made extensitive studies on these processes .",
    "it was found that @xmath31 and @xmath50 measurements are well described by the state - of - the - art recent theoretical calculations ; however , the measurements on the @xmath51-jets and @xmath52-jet indicate a need of an improved understanding of these processes . the measurements with improved precision from the tevatron experiments would be the keys for deeper understanding of these processes and benefit for future physics analyses at the tevatron and also at the lhc .    9 cdf collaboration , cdf public note 9321 .",
