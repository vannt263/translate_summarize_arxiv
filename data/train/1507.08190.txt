    "@xmath39 stands for @xmath100}_0 $ ] or @xmath99}_j$ ] , and @xmath47 is the momentum fraction of this photon to the electron or positron .",
    "then the @xmath109-expression can be rewritten as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the energy of the internal gluon . in small @xmath6 region",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath109 reduces exponentially with the increment of @xmath108 and could be very small , leading to large contributions to the production cross - section .",
    "in addition to the topology , the lbs photon density function provides another important factor for large production cross - sections .",
    "a bigger energy @xmath104 corresponds to a bigger rapidity @xmath112 , and vice versa . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger photon momentum fraction @xmath47 indicates more @xmath39 events with larger energy can be achieved . as shown by fig.([pdf ] ) , the lbs photon density function behaves moderately in small and intermediate @xmath47 regions and increases fast when approaching to its allowable largest @xmath47 .",
