    "star forming activity in galaxies is closely related to the distribution and physical conditions of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the large - scale surveys , which are represented by columbia - univ .",
    "de chile co surveys , had investigated the global distribution of gmcs , structures of molecular gas both in space and velocity , and the total amount of the molecular gas in the milky way @xcite . in addition , the detailed structures , the size , and the mass of individual galactic regions and gmcs are also revealed by observations of @xmath11co ( @xmath12=10 ) , @xmath11co ( @xmath12=21 ) and @xmath13co ( @xmath12=10 ) lines , mostly with small and middle telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the global distribution of physical conditions such as temperature , density and column density over the gmcs is still unclear because such observations have been carried out only in lower transition lines of co.    we made survey observations in the @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 43 ) emission line toward the orion - a gmc to derive the physical properties of molecular gas over the gmc , with the same angular resolution of as those of the previous @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) and @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 21 ) observations @xcite .",
    "this enables us to directly compare the intensities of the different co transitions and thus to estimate the temperature and the column and volume densities of the gas .",
    "the orion - a gmc is the most suitable site for studying massive star formation because of its close distance to the sun ( @xmath14 pc by @xcite ) .",
    "star formation is ongoing in the integral - shaped filament with the extent of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 pc ) , along the north - south direction , which consists of several components such as omc-1 to -5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite surveyed the orion - monoceros region in the @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) line with the 1.2-m telescope ( of hpbw ) as a part of columbia - univ .",
    "de chile co survey .",
    "they determined the spatial extent of three gmcs , orion a , orion b and mon r2 ( figure [ ori10 ] ) , where the mass was evaluated to be 1.0 @xmath17 , 0.8 @xmath17 , and 0.9 @xmath18 , respectively , comparing with the virial mass , the lte mass , and the co mass .",
    "@xcite re - observed the same region in the same line with uniform sampling .",
    "@xcite mapped orion - a and -b gmcs in the @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 21 ) line using the tokyo - nro 60-cm survey telescope . the @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 21)/@xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) intensity ratio was almost unity on the main structure of the clouds , hii regions , reflection nebulae , and the western edge of the clouds .",
    "they estimated the gas density over the gmcs using the intensity ratio by the large velocity gradient method , and the densities of the main and peripheral regions were @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "@xcite surveyed the orion - a gmc in the @xmath13co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) line with the at&t bell laboratories 7-m telescope ( of angular resolution ) . the @xmath13co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) map revealed that the overall structure of the cloud is filamentary .",
    "this morphology indicates that the northern part of orion a is compressed and supports massive star formation .",
    "the southern part is however diffuse and exhibits chaotic spatial and velocity structure , supporting only intermediate- to low - mass star formation .",
    "the integral - shaped filament is about 0.5 pc wide , at least 13 pc long , and has a mass of @xmath22 estimated from the @xmath13co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) data .",
    "@xcite explained these properties as resulting from the compression of the interstellar medium by a superbubble driven by the orion ob association .",
    "@xcite also mapped the orion - a gmc in the @xmath13co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) line and found 39 filamentary structures . @xcite mapped the same cloud in @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 21 ) , @xmath13co ( @xmath12=21 ) , and c@xmath23o ( @xmath12 = 21 ) and derived temperature and density by comparing their data as well as @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) , @xmath13co ( @xmath12=10 ) , and c@xmath23o ( @xmath12 = 10 ) data .",

    "fuji submillimeter - wave telescope found that the distribution of [ c@xmath24i](@xmath25p@xmath26@xmath25p@xmath27 ) is quite similar to that of @xmath13co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) .",
    "the gmc accompanies the orion ob1 association , which is known as a typical stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "the association consists of several subgroups named ob1a - d from the northwest of the gmc .",
    "the numbers of stars in subgroup a , b , c , and d are 53 , 31 , 34 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "ages of the subgroups have been thought to be almost older from the northwest .",
    "ob1a , the oldest subgroup is 11 myr old . ob1b and ob1c were formed 15 myr ago in the close generation , while @xcite analyzed that the ob1c subgroup is older than the ob1b subgroup .",
    "ob1d subgroup , located at the nearest to the orion - a gmc and known as the orion nebula and ngc1976 , was estimated less than 1 myr old .",
    "the differences in ages and evolutional stages of the orion - a ob1 subgroups and the gmc can be interpreted as the result of the sequential star formation , such as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the global star formation history of the orion ob1 association and the gmc is therefore crucial to understand the formation of a stellar cluster and triggered star formation scenarios .",
    "several observations indicated that there are gradients in morphology , in velocity structure , and in intensity of emission lines over the orion - a gmc .",
    "the temperature - weighted velocity maps of the @xmath11co lines traced the substantial velocity gradient from the north ( @xmath28 km s@xmath29 ) to the south ( @xmath30 km s@xmath29 ) over the gmc @xcite .",
    "the origin of the velocity gradient has been attributed to rotation of the gmc @xcite or to large scale expansion driven by the stellar winds of the orion ob1 association @xcite .",
    "@xcite also advocated the latter , because there were evidences of interaction between the orion ob1 association and the orion - a gmc .",
    "for example , there are sharp @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) intensity drop and velocity shifts with respect to the main component of the cloud at the edge of the cloud , which are attributed to expanding shells driven by an hii region , the orion nebula , excited by young massive stars in ob1c .",
    "the integrated intensity ratio of [ c@xmath24i](@xmath25p@xmath26@xmath25p@xmath27)/@xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 32 ) also shows a gradient from north ( @xmath310.1 ) to south ( @xmath311.2 ) @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the [ c@xmath24i](@xmath25p@xmath26@xmath25p@xmath27)/@xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 32 ) ratio was interpreted as a consequence of the temperature gradient .",
    "in addition , heating by the orion ob1 association may be responsible for the global gradient .",
    "the diffuse interstellar material may have been swept up and accumulated by the ob1 association through the processes that made the temperature and intensity gradients in the orion - a gmc .",
    "some authors suggested that the triggered star formation is occurring by the interaction between the orion ob1 association and the orion - a gmc @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the details of the observations .",
    "the results of the survey , the distribution and velocities over the gmc , are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the physical properties of the molecular gas using the @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 43 ) data with other archival data and also discuss the triggered star formation in the gmc . in the last section ,",

    "the results also indicate a gradient of the temperature that ranges within @xmath125=20 k in the south to 80 k in the north .",
    "the non - lte analysis shows that the kinetic temperature and the density are increasing near the co front including g208.375 - 19.0 .",
    "the gas associated with the edge of the northeast part of the cloud including the co front is warm ( @xmath173 k ) , dense ( @xmath174 @xmath20 ) , and optically thin .",
    "this indicates the global compression of the gas in the northern part of orion a. this may be caused by the heating by uv emission from ob stars or compressing of the gas by an accumulation of the diffuse gas to the co front that relates with the triggered star formation .",
