    "the ubiquitous presence of impurities in condensed matter systems is often a contentious problem .",
    "but they are also responsible for such intriguing phenomena as anderson localization and the kondo effect .",
    "while impurities and their effects are often a concern or subject of experiments , they can also be used as an experimental tool .",
    "for instance , by probing the scattering or bound states induced by a single localized impurity , information about the underlying microscopic  as opposed to thermodynamic  properties of the impurity - free bulk can be obtained .",
    "a striking example of this is in high - temperature superconducting systems , where tunneling experiments have been able to measure the local density of states near an impurity atom , in the superconducing state .",
    "@xcite the spatial structure of which is related to the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter , or cooper - pair wave function of the bulk , e.g. , @xmath3- or @xmath4-wave . similarly ,",
    "a fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) system can support exotic quasiparticles that carry a fractional charge .",
    "these quasiparticles , predicted by laughlin,@xcite were first observed in the nonequilibrium shot - noise of the current carrying fqh edge states.@xcite more recently , experimental evidence of fractionally charged quasiparticles occurring in the bulk@xcite has been found , as well as through numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite    on the theoretical side , the effects of impurities on fqh systems has been a topic of great interest .",
    "prior works have mostly focused on the effects of a single localized scalar or magnetic potential on the local density .",
    "@xcite here , we report on another interesting aspect , which involves probing the impurity - induced bound states in a fqh system to test for the existence of localized fractionally charged laughlin - quasiparticles . to this end",
    ", we numerically calculated the spectral function of a fqh droplet by exact diagonalization in the presence of an attractive impurity potential and extracted the spectral weights of the resulting bound states . in principle",
    "the bound - state spectral weight(s ) correspond to the fraction of a bare electron in the bound state , i.e. , the fractional charge .    in a noninteracting system",
    "the spectral weight of a bound state @xmath5 is unity . for a landau - fermi liquid @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the so - called wave - function renormalization , or quasiparticle amplitude , which roughly corresponds to the fraction of a bare electron that remains in a quasiparticle .",
    "because an incompressible ground state of a fqh system is believed to support fractionally charged laughlin quasiparticles , the presence of an attractive impurity potential could bind one or more of these quasiparticles into a localized state .",
    "furthermore , jain s highly successful composite fermion theory @xcite and the elastic model of conti and vignale@xcite predict a fermi - liquid - like spectral peak at the chemical potential that corresponds to a single - particle excitation of a bound complex of multiple composite fermions , which re - forms an electron quasiparticle .",
    "the electron - quasiparticle peak has not been observed in tunneling experiments or in exact diagonalization studies of finite - sized systems,@xcite including the present one .",
    "these non - laughlin - quasiparticles , if present , could also be bound to an impurity potential .",
    "a signature of this would be a bound - state spectral weight that approaches unity .",
    "for the largest system sizes studied in the present work , we do find such a state , but , owing to finite size effects , its identification as an electron - quasiparticle remains tenuous .    in the following section , we outline how impurity bound",
    "states and energies can be identified within standard diagrammatic many - body theory for the single - particle green s function , with and without electron - electron interactions , using the @xmath8-matrix formalism .",
    "after which , details are given in secs .",
    "[ sec : fqhe on a haldane sphere ] and [ sec : spectral function ] for the exact numerical calculations of the green s function and relevant spectral function for a finite - sized fractional quantum hall system , in the spherical geometry .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the location of the possibly complex poles , in frequency space , of the single - particle green s function determines the energies and lifetimes of the single - particle excitations of the system .",
    "@xcite for example , in a noninteracting impurity - free system , the fourier transformed zero - temperature ( retarded ) green s function is @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the system volume , @xmath12 the chemical potential , and @xmath13 is the dispersion . as one expects , the poles of @xmath14 occur when @xmath15 . in the presence of an attractive impurity potential , additional poles can form .",
    "these indicate the impurity - induced bound states . for a static impurity potential @xmath16 , and neglecting electron - electron interactions for the moment , the dyson equation for the time - ordered green s function",
    "is @xmath17 where the self - energy @xmath18 .",
    "any additional poles of @xmath19 that are related to the impurity are more easily determined by rewriting dyson s equation into a @xmath8-matrix equation . by iterating the green s function",
    "can also be expressed as @xmath20 where the so - called @xmath8-matrix is given by @xmath21 as the poles of the clean system are given by @xmath22 , from eq .   any additional ones , related to the impurity , must be determined by poles of the @xmath8-matrix .    in one - dimension and for a delta - function impurity potential , the @xmath8-matrix equation can be straightforwardly solved .",
    "its single pole @xmath23 , below the bottom of the band , corresponds to the well - known solution of schrdinger s equation for the bound - state energy of an attractive delta - function potential . near the bound - state energy , the local density of states",
    "@xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the normalized bound - state wave function .",
    "the spectral weight @xmath5 of the bound state is then @xmath27 although in two- and three - dimensions a delta - impurity potential must be treated more carefully , bound states in noninteracting quantum hall systems have been extensively studied .",
    "@xcite    as electron - electron interactions dominate in the fractional quantum hall regime , they must also be included in the calculation of the electron green s function , along with the impurity potential .",
    "the @xmath8-matrix formulation of the impurity problem can be generalized to a interacting system.@xcite in general , interactions lead to a finite lifetime of bound states producing a resonance , or quasi - bound state . additionally ,",
    "as shown in the following , interactions renormalize the impurity potential .",
    "this renormalized or effective potential can support additional quasi - bound states .    for a system with electron - electron interactions , for example coulomb",
    ", dyson s equation retains the same form , but now the self - energy @xmath28 contains both electron - electron correlations and impurity scattering diagrams .",
    "these two contributions can be formally separated by writing @xmath29 , where @xmath30 contains all irreducible diagrams that involve only the coulomb interaction between electrons , and @xmath31 contains all diagrams with at least one impurity potential .",
    "@xmath31 accounts for the bare impurity potential and terms involving combinations of both the impurity and coulomb interaction to all orders .",
    "dyson s equation can then be formally rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the exact interacting green s function in the absence of the impurity .",
