    "recently , magnetic - field - induced superconductivity ( fisc ) has been observed in organic superconductors @xmath4   and @xmath3  @xcite , where bets is bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene . in these salts ,",
    "localized spins on fe@xmath5 exhibit antiferromagnetic long - range order at ambient pressure at low temperatures .",
    "the fisc in these compounds is considered to be due to the jaccarino - peter mechanism  @xcite , where the localized spins are aligned uniformly at high fields .",

    "they have fitted the experimental phase diagrams by fisher s theory  @xcite based on the jaccarino - peter mechanism .",
    "the resultant upper critical field of low - field superconductivity is much smaller than their experimental data .",
    "they have suggested that the reason for the discrepancy is that the jaccarino - peter - fisher theory does not take into account the antiferromagnetic long - range order at low fields  @xcite .    in recent works ,",
    "one of the authors has extended the jaccarino - peter mechanism to antiferromagnetic superconductors with canted spin structures in magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the canted spin structure generates the ferromagnetic moments that create exchange fields acting on the conduction electrons through kondo interactions .",
    "if the kondo interactions are antiferromagnetic , the exchange fields partly cancel the zeeman energy . as a result",
    ", the pauli paramagnetic pair - breaking effect can be largely reduced , and the upper critical field can exceed the pauli paramagnetic limit ( chandrasekhar and clongston limit )  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism occurs even in the presence of the orbital pair - breaking effect  @xcite .",
    "we call this mechanism an extended jaccarino - peter mechanism in this paper .",
    "since the canted antiferromagnetic phase occurs in the compound @xmath3   for @xmath6  @xcite , we apply the mechanism to this compound .    in the compound @xmath3 ,",
    "the fisc has been observed both for @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams for @xmath6 and @xmath9 are rather different , and it is attributed to the anisotropy of the fermi surface and the kondo interactions between the localized spins and the conduction electrons .",
    "we take into account the fermi surface anisotropy by effective masses .",

    "they have performed the quantitative calculations of the upper critical fields for type - ii superconductors nb , nbse@xmath10 , and mgb@xmath10 using fermi surfaces obtained by first - principles calculations  @xcite .",
    "a theory of the upper critical field for layered superconductors has been proposed by lebed and yamaji  @xcite , and developed by lebed and hayashi  @xcite .",
    "they have found that when the layer spacing is large the upper critical field exhibits a reentrant transition or an enhancement at low temperatures in the quantum region , due to an effect of dimensional crossover induced by the magnetic field  @xcite . in the compounds @xmath3 , however , since the upper critical field of the low - field superconductivity did not exhibit either a reentrant transition or an enhancement in the experimental phase diagrams , the dimensional crossover does not seem to take place .",

    "therefore , the lorentz force acting on the electrons on the fermi surface near the @xmath222 axis becomes stronger and superconductivity is more suppressed when @xmath217 decreases .",
    "the order parameter of @xmath2-wave pairing has nodes on the @xmath222 axis , while that of @xmath1-wave pairing has the largest amplitude there .",

    "[ fig : d2c ] that the fflo state does not occur for @xmath2-wave pairing in low - field superconductivity near @xmath204 .",
