    "at a first glance it may seem surprising that many chaotic dynamical systems have explicit analytical solutions .",
    "but many examples are readily at hand .",
    "the shift map @xcite @xmath0 for instance , is `` bernoulli '' @xcite , the strongest form of chaos .",
    "nevertheless the shift map is readily solved explicitly , @xmath1 another example is provided by the logistic mapping @xmath2,\\ \\",

    "but what about the quantized versions of classically chaotic systems , commonly known as quantum chaotic systems@xcite ? here ,",
    "too , the answer is affirmative .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that regular quantum graphs provide a large class of explicitly solvable quantum chaotic systems . in order to strengthen first analytical and numerical results presented in @xcite ,",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the explicit periodic orbit expansions obtained in @xcite are more than formal identities",
    ". we will prove below that ( i ) the spectrum of regular quantum graphs is computable explicitly and analytically , state by state , via convergent periodic orbit expansions and ( ii ) the periodic orbit series converge to the correct spectral eigenvalues .",
    "the main body of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the basics of quantum graph theory and derive the general form of the spectral equation . in sec .",
    "iii we define regular quantum graphs . in sec .",
    "iv we present the explicit periodic orbit expansions of individual eigenvalues of regular quantum graphs .",
    "we also specify a summation scheme that guarantees convergence to the correct results .",
    "the derivations presented in sec .",
    "iv are mathematically rigorous except for one step where we interchange integration and summation to arrive at our final results .",
    "this is a `` dangerous operation '' , which is not allowed without further investigation .",
    "this point is resolved in sec .",
    "v , where we present the analytical proofs that justify the interchange of integration and summation performed in sec .",
    "this result establishes that the periodic orbit expansions investigated in this paper converge in the usual sense of elementary analysis . in sec .",
    "vi we investigate the convergence properties of the periodic orbit series obtained in sec .",
    "we prove analytically that there exists at least one quantum graph for which the convergence is not absolute , but conditional .",
    "according to riemann s well - known reordering theorem ( see , e.g. @xcite , volume ii , page 33 ) , it is possible to reorder the terms of a conditionally convergent sum in such a way that it converges to any prescribed number .",
    "this is the reason why in sec .",
    "iv we place so much emphasis on specifying a summation scheme that guarantees convergence of the periodic orbit sums to the correct spectral eigenvalues . in sec .",
    "vii we present an alternative way of solving the spectral equations of regular quantum graphs : lagrange s inversion formula .",
    "although a perfectly sound and fast - converging method for solving the spectral equation , it lacks the physical appeal of periodic orbit expansions which are based on concrete physical objects such as periodic orbits and their geometrical and dynamical properties . in sec .",
    "viii we discuss our results , point out promising research directions and conclude the paper .",
    "since many scientists will find the existence of convergent periodic orbit expansions surprising , we found it necessary to establish this result with an extra degree of rigor .",
    "this necessarily requires strong , but somewhat technical proofs .",
    "however , in order not to break the flow of the paper , we adopt a hierarchical approach presenting the material in three stages .",
    "the most pertinent aspects of our results are presented in the main text as outlined above .",
    "supporting higher - level , but formal , material is presented in appendix a. lower level material , such as formulae , definitions and lemmas , is relegated to appendix b.    in order for the proofs to be convincing , and to be accessible to a wide readership , we used only concepts of elementary undergraduate analysis in our proofs , altogether avoiding advanced mathematical concepts , such as distributions @xcite .",
    "this is an important point since our paper seeks mathematical rigor on a common basis acceptable to all readers . in this spirit",
    "the alert reader will notice that we completely avoid the use of dirac s delta `` function '' @xcite .",
    "this is necessary since the delta `` function '' is a distribution @xcite , a concept we found to be highly confusing for the general reader .",
    "although there is nothing `` wrong '' with the delta `` function '' , if treated properly as a distribution or linear functional , the confusion surrounding the delta `` function '' started with von neumann s critique @xcite at a time when the modern tools of distribution theory were not yet available . therefore , although ultimately completely unjustified , von neumann s critique @xcite tainted the delta `` function '' to such an extent that it still ca nt be used in a rigorous context without causing heated debate",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity and clarity of our arguments , we prefer to avoid it . as a consequence ,",
    "the presentation of the material in this paper and all of our proofs are conducted without using the concept of level densities , which are usually defined with the help of dirac s delta `` function '' .",
    "we emphasize that there is a fundamental difference between an analytical solution and an _ explicit _ analytical solution .",
    "while the spectral equation for quantum graphs is known in great detail @xcite , and periodic orbit expansions for the spectral density and the staircase function of quantum graphs are known @xcite , these results are all implicit .",
    "this means that they do not yield the spectral eigenvalues in the form `` @xmath5 '' .",
    "it is the novelty of this paper to obtain explicit analytical expressions of this type for a wide class of quantum chaotic systems , and prove their validity and convergence with mathematical rigor .",
    "the properties of the laplacian operator on graphs have been studied in great detail in the mathematical literature @xcite and the study of quantum mechanics on graphs has attracted considerable attention among chemists and physicists ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , especially in the quantum chaos community @xcite . the purpose of this section is to acquaint the reader with the main ideas of quantum graph theory .",
    "since many excellent publications on the theory of quantum graphs are available ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we will present only those ideas and facts that are of direct relevance to the subject of this paper .",
    "a quantum graph consists of a network of bonds and vertices with a quantum particle travelling on it .",
    "an example of a graph with ten bonds and six vertices is shown in fig .  1 . the number of bonds is denoted by @xmath6 , the number of vertices by @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we focus entirely on finite quantum graphs , i.e. @xmath6 , @xmath8 .",
    "we define directed bonds on the graph such that the bond @xmath9 connecting vertex number @xmath10 with vertex number @xmath11 is different from the bond @xmath12 connecting the vertices in the opposite direction .",
    "there are @xmath13 directed bonds .",
    "it is useful to define the linearized bond index @xmath14 : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 connected .",
    "the index @xmath17 labels sequentially all @xmath6 directed bonds of the graph with @xmath16 . for the directed bonds @xmath9 with @xmath18 we define @xmath19 . this way the sign of the counting index reflects the directionality of the bond .",
    "the network of bonds and vertices defines the graph s topology .",
    "the topology of a graph alone does not completely specify the quantum graph .",
    "this is so because , for instance , the bonds of the graph may be dressed with potentials @xcite",
    ". since the quantum graphs we study in this paper are finite , bounded systems , their spectra are discrete .",
    "the spectrum of a quantum graph is obtained by solving the one - dimensional schrdinger equation on the graph subjected to the usual boundary conditions of continuity and quantum flux conservation . a particularly useful way of obtaining the spectral equation for a given quantum graph is the scattering quantization approach @xcite which yields the spectral equation in the form @xmath20=0 , \\label{specdet}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the quantum scattering matrix of the graph @xcite and @xmath22 is the wave number , related to the energy via @xmath23 . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to know that the @xmath21 matrix is of dimension @xmath24 and can be decomposed into @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath24 unitary matrix and @xmath27 is a diagonal matrix of the form @xmath28\\ \\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda ' } , \\ \\",
    "\\lambda,\\lambda'=\\pm 1,\\ldots,\\pm n_b \\label{dd}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the ordering of the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ( [ decomp1 ] ) is neither unique nor important in the present context .",
    "it depends on the details of how `` in '' and `` out '' channels are assigned to the indices of the @xmath21 matrix .",
    "since the computation of the energy spectrum involves only traces and determinants , the precise ordering of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ( [ decomp1 ] ) does not affect our final results .",
    "physically the quantities @xmath33 are the time - reversal invariant parts of the bond actions @xcite . a possible time - reversal breaking part of the bond actions",
    "is understood to be absorbed in the matrix @xmath32 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we will in the following refer to @xmath34 as the bond action of the bond @xmath35 .",
    "in this paper we focus exclusively on scaling quantum graphs @xcite . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath32 is a constant matrix , independent of @xmath22 , and the actions @xmath33 in ( [ dd ] ) split into the product @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant , the reduced bond action of the bond @xmath35 .",
    "physically the scaling case is an important case since it describes systems free from phase - space metamorphoses @xcite .",
    "scaling systems of this type arise in many physical contexts , for instance in microwave cavities partially filled with a dielectric @xcite , or rydberg atoms in external fields @xcite .",
    "it is possible to write ( [ specdet ] ) as a linear combination of trigonometric functions whose frequencies are directly related to the bond actions . in order to derive this representation we start by noting that @xmath38=\\det\\left(s^{1/2}\\right)\\ , ( -4)^{n_b}\\ , \\prod_{l=1}^{2n_b}\\ , \\sin(\\sigma_l/2 ) , \\label{dstruc}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the eigenphases of the unitary matrix @xmath21 . > from ( [ dstruc ] )",

    "are frequently referred to as words , we adopt the symbol @xmath212 to denote a particular necklace . for a given necklace @xmath212",

    "we note the identity @xmath222 in evaluating the functions defined above , we have to be very careful to take note of the cyclic nature of binary necklaces .",
    "therefore , for example , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , which also checks ( [ ident ] ) .",
    "in addition we define the set @xmath227 of all binary necklaces of length @xmath132 .",
    "let us look at @xmath228 .",
    "this set contains three necklaces , @xmath229 , @xmath230 ( cyclic rotation of symbols ) and @xmath231 .",
    "the necklace @xmath229 is not a primitive necklace , since it consists of a repetition of the primitive symbol @xmath208 .",

    "length 1 leads to the two cases @xmath246 and @xmath247 , where the symbols @xmath209 and @xmath208 , respectively , are repeated @xmath241 times .",
    "so , except for these two special necklaces , any necklace of prime length @xmath241 is automatically primitive .",
    "thus there are @xmath248 different necklaces with @xmath140 symbols @xmath208 and @xmath249 symbols @xmath209 , where the factor @xmath250 takes care of avoiding double counting of cyclically equivalent necklaces . in total , therefore , we have @xmath251 primitive necklaces of length @xmath241 , in agreement with ( [ nneck ] ) .",

    "there are only very few exact results in quantum chaos theory .",

    "the main result of this paper is an analytical proof of the validity and the convergence of the explicit spectral formulas ( [ explic ] ) and ( [ explic  ] ) , respectively .",
    "this result is novel in two respects .",
    "( i ) while periodic orbit expansions of the spectral density and the spectral staircase of a quantum system are basic tools of quantum chaos , the very concept of a periodic orbit expansion for individual spectral eigenvalues is new .",
    "( ii ) due to the exponential proliferation of the number of periodic orbits with their ( action ) lengths , it is frequently assumed in the quantum chaos community that periodic orbit expansions are formal tools at best , but do not converge .",
    "we proved in this paper that , at least as far as regular quantum graphs are concerned , and despite the exponential proliferation of periodic orbits in this case @xcite , the periodic orbit expansion ( [ explic  ] ) converges in the usual sense of elementary analysis .",
    "this result is also new .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of ( [ explic  ] ) is theorem t2 ( appendix a ) , i.e. an analytical proof that there is exactly one spectral point in every root cell @xmath90 . in discussions with our colleagues we found that while many pointed out the necessity of justifying the interchange of integration and summation in ( [ inter ] ) ( now established in sec .",
    "v with t3 ( appendix a ) ) , many were initially puzzled by the existence of root intervals and the organization of the spectral points into root cells , now guaranteed by t2 ( appendix a ) .",
    "this is so because regular quantum graphs have a positive topological entropy @xcite and are in this sense quantum chaotic systems .",
    "hence the spectrum of regular quantum graphs is expected to be `` wild '' , in complete contrast to the fact , proved in this paper , that the spectrum of regular quantum graphs can actually be organized into regular root cells . in this sense",
    "regular quantum graphs are closely related to other quantum chaotic systems that also show marked deviations from the expected universal behavior @xcite . as a specific example we mention chaotic billiards on the hyperbolic plane generated by arithmetic groups @xcite .",
    "we hope that the pedagogical presentation of the proofs in appendices a and b , with their hierarchical structure and the use of only elementary analysis concepts will help to establish theorems t2 and t3 ( appendix a ) , and their consequence , the existence of explicit , convergent periodic orbit expansions .",
    "we mention that the spectral equation ( [ specequ ] ) of a finite quantum graph is an example of an almost periodic function @xcite .",
    "more information on the analytical structure of the zeros of almost periodic functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are many basic quantum mechanical problems that lead to transcendental equations of the type ( [ specequ ] ) .",
    "so far the recommended method is to solve them graphically or numerically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the results presented in this paper , a third method is now available for presentation in text books on quantum mechanics : explicit analytical solutions .",
    "when the regularity condition ( [ regul ] ) is satisfied , either the lagrangian inversion method or the periodic orbit expansion ( [ explic  ] ) may be employed .",
    "since the lagrangian method is a purely mathematical tool without immediate physical meaning , the periodic orbit expansion may be preferred due to its direct physical relevance in terms of concrete classical physics .    having been established with mathematical rigor in this paper , formula ( [ explic  ] ) may serve as the starting point for many further investigations .",
    "we mention one : since according to ( [ explic  ] ) @xmath73 is known explicitly , so is the level spacing @xmath335 .",
    "this may give us an important handle on investigating analytically and exactly the nearest - neighbor spacing statistics @xmath336 @xcite of regular quantum graphs .",
    "whatever the precise properties of @xmath336 will be , one result is clear already : due to the existence of the root - free zones @xmath113 , established in sec .",
    "iii , @xmath336 is not wignerian . thus , regular quantum graphs will join the growing class of classically chaotic systems which do not show the generic properties of typical quantum chaotic systems .",
    "a corollary of some significance is the following . since we proved that for regular quantum graphs there is exactly one root @xmath73 of ( [ specequ ] ) in @xmath90 , this proves rigorously that for regular quantum graphs the number of roots of ( [ specequ ] ) smaller",
    "than @xmath22 grows like @xmath337 ( weyl s law @xcite ) .",
