    "this provides us with two main objections for a finite bare ghost dressing function :    * a finite value of @xmath7 requires , through , that @xmath57 be zero ; taking into account the fact that the subdominant terms , which vanish as @xmath52 , are supposed not to be logarithmic contributions but , at least , of the order of @xmath58 we are forced to conclude that zero is the _ only _ allowed finite value that the bare ghost dressing function can hit for to be consistently satisfied .",

    "the fact that , when multiplied by @xmath67 , it gives a finite result in the infinite cut - off limit does not suffice .",
    "as we have already recalled , it has to differ from its asymptotic value by inverse powers of the cut - off , which is obviously wrong in where @xmath68 only converges up to inverse powers of the _ logarithm of the cut - off_. the same is true for @xmath23 .",

    "thus , as done in @xcite , one can consider @xmath70 to be renormalised by @xmath53 .",

[ revisiting ] [ sec3 ]    lattice simulations first provide us with estimates for bare quantities ( correlation functions ) in the lattice regularization scheme , where the role of the regularization cut - off is played by the inverse of the lattice spacing , @xmath28 . in present simulations @xmath28 is moderate , ranging from @xmath74gev@xmath9 for @xmath11 up to @xmath75gev@xmath9 for @xmath76 .",
    "those bare quantities should be further renormalised by applying mom - like schemes . that this multiplicative renormalisation procedure works has been proven by reisz in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the remaining corrections due to finite spacing ( vanishing in the continuum limit ) are considered to behave as powers of the lattice spacing .",
    "those renormalised quantities are usually the reliable result of the simulations and the ones directly connected with physical predictions . on the contrary , the recent work  @xcite we discussed above supplies a prediction for a bare quantity : the bare ghost propagator dressing function .",
    "therefore , the non - renormalised lattice estimates for this dressing function deserve by themselves a particular interest , as far as they could allow us to test that prediction .    in the last few years , many works have been devoted , at least partially , to the lattice computation of the ghost propagator .",
    "they mainly follow ref .",
    "@xcite in writing the faddev - popov operator as a lattice divergence : @xmath77 where the operator @xmath78 reads @xmath79 those definitions , complemented with conversion routines between the lie algebra and the lie group , allow for a very efficient lattice implementation .",
    "some details about the procedure for the inversion of the faddeev - popov operator and some results will be found in @xcite .",

    "the lattice simulations clearly favour the first type and it is implied in the coming discussion that we are in this situation .",

    "we shall comment briefly on the various parameters it involves .",
    "insofar as the gluon propagator reaches a finite non - zero value at vanishing momentum ( as it appears to be true on the lattice ) , @xmath94 takes a finite value which depends on the cut - off by inverse powers .",
    "thus , the dominant ( in relative terms ) @xmath59-dependent part of @xmath25 in the vicinity of 0 ( i.e. the second term in the bracket of ) _ does not require any renormalisation _ , _  = 1 + n h_1   ( q^2 ) + o(q^2 )  .",
    "this ( quasi-)independence of the slope with respect to the cut - off is of course important to ensure multiplicative renormalisability , since the latter demands that the @xmath59-dependence of the bare and renormalised green s functions be the same up to negative powers of the cutoff . on the contrary the global multiplicative factor @xmath7",

    "however this does not tell how @xmath109 depends on @xmath27 .",
    "we have generalized the solution recently proposed by kondo for the zero - momentum ghost dressing function and the kugo - ojima parameter , @xmath43 , by deriving eqs .",
    "( [ sols ] ) where both kugo - ojima parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath44 appear written in terms of @xmath7 and the horizon function , @xmath120 , at any finite cut - off . in particular , we have shown that the one relating @xmath43 and @xmath7 , after applying the gap equation , , is close to be verified by lattice estimates for @xmath121gev , but that this is a pure coincidence due to the small cut - off in lattice calculations .",
    "we have argued that neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 can be multiplicatively renormalised .",
    "indeed , from the anomalous dimension of the ghost propagator renormalisation constant we conclude that no solution with a cut - off independent bare @xmath7 is possible . if the gap equation is valid , for @xmath52 , then @xmath122 and @xmath123 such that @xmath124 .",
    "if one relaxes the gap equation  , one can satisfy @xmath45 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the kugo - ojima condition @xmath125 is asymptotically fulfilled for the bare @xmath0 while the renormalised ghost dressing function is finite and non zero .",
    "we have argued that lattice qcd , notwithstanding some similarity with the gribov - zwanziger approach , has no reason to fulfill zwanziger s horizon gap equation .",
    "we have shown , however , that this fact will not change much about our conclusions concerning the ghost propagator .",
    "our major conclusion about the ghost propagator is obtained from the joint use of lattice data and of a result stemming from the ghost propagator dyson - schwinger equation : this result consists in a simple and cut - off independent formula for the ghost propagator dependence at small momentum .",
    "if we choose 1.5 gev as the renormalisation scale , we get from lattice f(1.5 ) 1.6 f_r(0,1.5 ) 2.2 .",
    "this has of course to be refined particularly regarding finite volume effects which should be considered with more care .",
    "the major point in this note , from the point of view of the renormalisability of the theory , is that lattice artefacts behave as powers of @xmath29 ( in this case @xmath126 ) .",
    "of course at @xmath127 lattice spacing is not yet small and this leads to a significant uncertainty which deserves further study .",
    "any statement from lattice concerning bare quantities has to be taken with great caution since the very slow logarithmic dependence has chances to escape numerical observation .",
