    "observations of the @xcite trough in the spectra of intermediate redshift quasars , coupled with large fluctuations in the mean transmission of the forest , provide the most direct evidence for the tail - end of reionisation occurring around @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , to date only a handful of ultraviolet ( uv ) quasar spectra suitable for detailed analyses of the forest have been obtained ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the transmission is sensitive to small fractions only , and is thus unsuitable for probing the earliest stages of reionisation .",
    "fortunately , the impact of reionisation on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can still be probed , albeit indirectly , over a wider redshift baseline with the existing wealth of high quality , high signal - to - noise forest data .",
    "firstly , the increased temperature of the igm expected following reionisation ( @xcite ) will thermally broaden absorption lines in the forest ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is some evidence that observed line widths are consistent with a sudden increase in the igm temperature around @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , although the error bars on the measurements are large and not all studies agree on this result ( @xcite ) . secondly , the residual fraction in the igm , which is in photo - ionisation equilibrium with the metagalactic uv background , will be lowered through the temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if the temperature of the igm rises suddenly following reionisation , a similarly sudden decrease in the fraction , and hence the observed forest opacity , will result ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , in a study using 1061 moderate resolution quasar spectra obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , statistically measured such a departure from the otherwise smooth , power law evolution of the forest opacity .",
    "a sudden decrease of around @xmath8 per cent was observed in the effective optical depth at @xmath1 , followed by a recovery to its former power law evolution by @xmath9 . @xcite",
    "have subsequently reconfirmed the @xcite result by using 86 high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra obtained with keck / hires / esi and magellan / mike to directly measure the opacity .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have also recently detected a narrow dip in the forest effective optical depth at @xmath1 , albeit at a low level of statistical significance ( @xmath10 ) , using another set of 40 high resolution spectra obtained with vlt / uves .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter t02 ) compared detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the forest to the @xcite data and interpreted this feature as indirect evidence for photo - heating during reionisation . however , recent theoretical studies indicate it is difficult to explain this narrow feature in the opacity evolution by invoking a rapid temperature boost in the igm alone",
    ". @xcite used analytical and numerical arguments to demonstrate that there are too few hard photons available to heat the entire igm by the required amount ( @xmath11 ) over the timescale on which the observed opacity decreases ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "state - of - the - art radiative transfer simulations also indicate that reionisation and reheating will be an extended rather than sudden process , with the volume averaged igm temperature rising gradually from higher redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "a rapid injection of energy into the igm during reionisation is thus unlikely to explain the sharp initiation of the observed dip in the forest opacity .",
    "somewhat separate to this argument , however , is the explanation for the subsequent _ recovery _ of the observed opacity to its former power law evolution by @xmath9 .",
    "let us assume that the narrow dip in the forest effective optical depth is indeed initiated by a large , rapid temperature boost in the igm following reionisation ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "although this will not occur over the whole igm , such rapid heating is not necessarily excluded in localised patches close to quasars with very hard spectra , where the requisite hard photons are abundant .",
    "following reionisation , the thermal evolution of the igm at low density is dominated by the balance between photo - heating and adiabatic cooling due to hubble expansion ( @xcite ) . however , if the opacity evolution were driven by the thermal state of the igm alone through the recombination rate , any subsequent recovery in the opacity due to adiabatic cooling would occur over a hubble time  too long to explain the rapid recovery in the @xcite feature .",
    "the study of t02 instead demonstrated that this interpretation is too simplistic .",
    "they found that the hydrodynamical response of the igm following a sudden reheating , coupled with the impact of the extra electrons liberated during reionisation , are enough to drive the opacity back to its former power law evolution by @xmath9 as observed by @xcite  much earlier than one would expect using the simple argument above .    to date",
    ", the only dedicated study of the impact of reionisation on the forest effective optical depth using high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the igm has been performed by t02 .",
    "@xcite recently presented a detailed analysis of the evolution of the forest opacity using radiative transfer simulations of reionisation .",
    "however , their study necessarily used low resolution , post - processed dark matter simulations , and they were thus unable to model the impact of the gas hydrodynamics on the recovery of the forest opacity . in light of these recent observational and theoretical results",
    "we therefore re - examine the impact of reionisation on the evolution of the forest opacity using semi - analytic modelling and high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the igm .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the explanation for the _ recovery _ of the dip observed in the forest opacity .",
    "this paper is therefore closely related to the work presented in @xcite , where the issues surrounding the _ initiation _ of the feature first detected by @xcite ( _ i.e. _ the plausibility , or lack of , for the rapid photo - heating of the igm ) were examined in detail .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in  2 with a brief review of the relationship between the forest opacity and the underlying physical properties of the igm . in ",
    "3 we use a semi - analytic model to examine the evolution of the forest opacity following photo - heating in the igm during inhomogeneous reionisation . motivated by these results ,",
    "we then proceed to model the forest opacity in more detail using hydrodynamical simulations of the igm .",
    "the simulations are described in  4 , and the evolution of the forest opacity in the simulations is presented in  5 . in  6",
    "we investigate the impact of sudden reheating on the igm gas distribution and peculiar velocity field ; we find that our simulations are unable to reproduce the narrow feature observed in the forest opacity evolution .",
    "finally , we consider alternative explanations for the observational data in  7 before concluding in  8 .",
    "the forest of absorption lines observed in the spectra of high redshift quasars originates from the neutral hydrogen remaining in the intervening , low density igm following reionisation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean normalised flux of the forest , @xmath13 , is the simplest observable quantity , and it is often expressed as an effective optical depth    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the underlying optical depth in each pixel of the spectrum or spectra from which @xmath16 is measured . assuming the igm is highly ionised and in photo - ionisation equilibrium with the metagalactic uv background , and the low density igm ( @xmath17 ) follows a power - law temperature density relation , @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , the optical depth at @xmath19 may be written as ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )    @xmath20 @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the present day baryon and matter densities as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath24 for the present day hubble constant @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the normalised gas density , @xmath27 is the gas temperature at mean density , @xmath28 is the slope of the temperature density relation and @xmath29 is the hydrogen photo - ionisation rate .",
    "the power - law temperature dependence is due to the case - a recombination coefficient , and @xmath30 accounts for the extra electrons liberated during reionisation ; @xmath31 prior to reionisation and @xmath32 afterwards for a helium fraction by mass of @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effective optical depth can then be estimated by integrating over all possible igm densities @xmath34 .",
    "( [ eq : fgpa ] ) is the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( fgpa ) , and although it ignores the effect of redshift space distortions on the forest opacity , it clearly elucidates the relationship between the opacity and the underlying physical properties of the igm . a sudden decrease in the effective optical depth ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )",
    "can thus be attributed to an increase in the igm temperature , either by raising @xmath27 or changing will increase the temperature in underdense ( overdense ) regions of the igm while decreasing the temperature in overdense ( underdense ) regions . whether raising or lowering @xmath28 subsequently decreases",
    "the effective optical depth of the forest thus depends on redshift . at @xmath35",
    "the forest opacity is mainly sensitive to underdense regions in the igm .",
    "lowering @xmath28 therefore decreases the effective optical depth at @xmath36 by producing hotter , more highly ionised voids ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "typical values adopted for @xmath28 in forest models lie in the range @xmath37 , although there is some evidence to suggest a more complex relationship between temperature and density , perhaps with @xmath38 , may be required to reproduce the observed forest flux distribution ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath28 , an increase in the photo - ionisation rate , or a combination of both . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in the free electron fraction will raise the opacity by reducing the recombination timescale .",
    "both an increase in the igm temperature and an @xmath39 per cent change in the free electron fraction will be associated with reionisation . keeping these points in mind",
    ", we now proceed to describe a semi - analytical model for inhomogeneous reionisation which utilises this useful approximation .",
    "before analysing our detailed hydrodynamical simulations , we first consider a simplified semi - analytic model which illustrates the difficulty of reproducing the localised feature observed by @xcite in the forest .",
    "although this model is unable to compute many of the detailed properties of the forest ( such as line broadening and the impact of peculiar velocities ) , it has the virtue of including inhomogeneous reionisation @xcite , which our hydrodynamical simulations do not .",
    "the model is based on the calculations presented in @xcite , who examined how reionisation can affect the temperature - density relation of the igm , and we refer the reader there for more details .    in brief , the model has three parts .",
    "the first determines the reionisation history of gas elements of a given density in the igm @xcite . for most of our calculations ,",
    "we assume that the probability that an element is reionised at any particular time is independent of its density , simply tracing the mean ionisation history , @xmath40 .",
    "we also compare to a  density - driven \" model in which high - density regions are ionised first ( because they sit near the biased regions that host quasars ) .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of reionisation suggest that the ionised regions are large and rare enough that this correlation is weak @xcite , so we usually use the density - independent model",
    ". we will assume that reionisation ends at @xmath41 , consistent with the calculations below , and that hydrogen reionisation ( which only affects the temperature of gas for which helium is still singly - ionised ) occurs at @xmath42 ; the latter has little effect on our calculation .    to make this comparison as straightforward as possible",
    ", we assume that @xmath40 is simply proportional to the mass in galaxies with @xmath43 ( in other words , these massive galaxies contain supermassive black holes that have gone through bright quasar phases ) .",
    "this provides a reasonable approximation to the quasar emissivity ( compared to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the luminosity function of @xcite ) and also leads to fast reionisation , with over @xmath44 of the ionisation occurring after @xmath45 , if reionisation ends at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient is to follow the thermal evolution of each gas element after reionisation .",
    "we again use the method presented in @xcite , which is in turn based on @xcite .",
    "we include all of the relevant atomic cooling , heating , recombination , and photo - ionisation processes , as well as adiabatic expansion ( and collapse for overdense regions ) .",
    "after reionisation , the dominant processes are photo - heating and adiabatic cooling , which together determine the asymptotic , nearly power law , temperature - density relation @xcite .",
    "the chief uncertainty in this model is the initial temperature after reionisation , @xmath46 , which depends in a non - trivial manner on the spectrum of the photons ionising the gas parcel @xcite .",
    "this may itself be inhomogeneous in the igm , because low - energy photons will be absorbed near their hosts , leaving many of the ionisations to be done by hard photons @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a range of possibilities for @xmath46 .",
    "our fiducial model takes @xmath47  k , larger than is typically expected in order to exaggerate the effect of heating ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    finally , in order to compute the average optical depth we need to assume an igm density distribution , @xmath48 ( averaged by volume ) , as well as the distribution of temperatures and ionisation rates at each density .",
    "we will use the density distribution recommended by @xcite :    @xmath49 \\ , d \\delta .",
    "\\label{eq : pvd}\\ ] ]    this form fits cosmological simulations at @xmath50@xmath51 quite well .",
    "note that the underlying simulation had somewhat different cosmological parameters than the currently preferred values ; it is , however , accurate enough for the qualitative calculations that follow .      to compute the effective optical depth",
    ", we assign each volume element of known density an optical depth according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fgpa ] ) .",
    "our model makes no predictions about the amplitude of the ionising background , and for simplicity we set @xmath52 over the entire redshift range @xmath50@xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with constraints derived by comparing observational data to simulations of the forest at @xmath54 ( @xcite ) , and yields a mean transmission reasonably close to the observed values .",
    "we choose the temperatures by following gas elements of the appropriate density after their most recent reionisation event using the thermal evolution code described above , with the reionisation redshifts distributed according to the overall ionisation history .",
    "we then calculate    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the probability distribution of temperatures for elements at density @xmath34 and is the effective optical depth .",
    "again , we emphasise that this ignores peculiar velocities of the gas , line blending ( and indeed the wings of every line ) , and the clustering of the absorbers , but it provides a qualitative description of the evolving transmission .",
    "[ fig : taueff - analytic ] shows some example histories computed in this manner . as a basis for comparison , the dotted curve ignores reionisation and assumes a constant ionising background and igm temperature ( @xmath57  k ) .",
    "this does not quantitatively match the observed evolution ; it merely serves to show that , without reionisation , our model produces smooth , nearly featureless evolution .     if we ignore reionisation and set @xmath57  k throughout .",
    "the other curves include reionisation at @xmath41 , as described in the text .",
    "the short - dashed , solid , and dot - dashed curves assume @xmath58  k , respectively .",
    "the long - dashed curve assumes @xmath59  k but that reionisation proceeds from high to low densities.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the other curves assume that helium reionisation ends at @xmath60 .",
    "the short - dashed , solid , and dot - dashed curves assume @xmath61  k , respectively ( all relatively large in order to exaggerate the effect ; see @xcite for self - consistent estimates of the plausible temperature range ) .",
    "the long - dashed curve takes @xmath62  k and assumes that reionisation is density - dependent @xcite ; this aspect of reionisation has only a small effect on the mean transmission .",
    "this is because the forest is sensitive to only a narrow range of densities near the mean , where the density modulation is modest anyway .",
    "according to these models , reionisation can certainly induce a feature in @xmath63 , so long as the temperature increase is large enough . in all cases",
    ", @xmath63 falls relatively steeply until @xmath64 before levelling off and returning closer to the expected evolution without reionisation .",
    "the shape is generic within these reionisation models , although note that the downward turn in is still significantly shallower than that observed in the observational data ( @xcite )",
    ". the pre - reionisation phase can be steepened by making reionisation occur faster , but the model assumed here is not far from empirical estimates of the evolution of the quasar emissivity . moreover , compressing reionisation into a short time interval limits the temperature jump that it can induce , because the photo - ionisation timescale associated with high - energy photons ( which provide the most efficient heating ) is quite long @xcite .    however , the post - reionisation evolution is completely generic and easy to understand . in this regime ,",
    "the thermal evolution is dominated by the competition between photo - heating and cooling by adiabatic expansion .",
    "the timescale for the cooling is therefore the expansion , or hubble , time  a substantial fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "there is no way to avoid this behaviour for the temperature history , and to the extent that the ly@xmath65 forest depends only on these temperatures , reionisation can not induce a _",
    "narrow _ feature in the transmission which recovers quickly to its pre - reionisation evolution .",
    "of course , we have emphasised that the forest is indeed more complex than this model , because of peculiar velocities , geometric effects , and line blending . in principle , these can induce a narrower feature , and t02 appealed to just such an effect to explain the @xcite feature . in their simulations , once the reheated gas in the igm became overpressurised with respect to its surroundings it started to expand , resulting in a sudden change in the peculiar velocity gradients in the igm .",
    "this extended the absorption lines in redshift space by shifting absorption from the saturated line cores to the wings , increasing the line equivalent widths and hence the mean opacity . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will examine all of these effects in more detail using new hydrodynamical simulations that do include a detailed reconstruction of the ly@xmath65 forest .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations in this study are performed using an upgraded version of the publicly available parallel tree - sph code gadget-2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all simulations have a box size @xmath66 comoving mpc and contain @xmath67 gas and dark matter particles .",
    "the mass of each gas particle is @xmath68 and the gravitational softening length is @xmath69 of the mean linear interparticle spacing .",
    "this adequately resolves the forest at @xmath70 ( @xcite ) and provides just over twice the mass resolution of the simulations used in the t02 study .",

    "] star formation is included using a simplified prescription which converts all gas particles with overdensity @xmath72 and temperature @xmath73 into collisionless stars , significantly speeding up the simulations .",
    "outputs are saved every @xmath74 in the redshift range @xmath70 , enabling a very fine sampling of the simulation data with redshift .",
    "the ionisation state of the gas particles is computed in the optically thin limit using a non - equilibrium ionisation algorithm which follows the abundances of six species : h  @xmath75 , h  @xmath76 , he  @xmath75 , he  @xmath77 , he  @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xcite ) . the ultraviolet background ( uvb ) model of @xcite ( hereafter hm01 ) including emission from quasars and galaxies is used to compute the h  @xmath75 , and photo - ionisation and heating rates .",
    "this model is in good agreement with observational constraints on the metagalactic photo - ionisation rate ( @xcite ) , although we set the hm01 photo - ionisation and heating rates for all species to zero at @xmath80 in order to match the simulations of t02 .",
    "the uvb is assumed to be spatially uniform in all our simulations .",
    "this will be a reasonable approximation at the photo - ionisation edge at @xmath81 , when the mean free path for hydrogen ionising photons is much larger than the average separation between ionising sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a full radiative transfer implementation is required to model the impact of inhomogeneous reionisation on the forest opacity ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "although reionisation does not _",
    "directly _ impact forest effective optical depth , our simulations do not capture the effect of the resulting fluctuations in the igm temperature , which do impact on the effective optical depth through the temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient .",
    "however , our simulation volume is @xmath66 comoving mpc , which is small on comparison to the @xmath82 comoving mpc scales on which large temperature fluctuations are expected ( @xcite ) .",
    "although not ideal , our assumption of instantaneous reheating on this smaller scale is therefore a reasonable approximation .",
    "furthermore , note that hm01 implicitly assumes that is reionised at all redshifts , _",
    "i.e. _ only exists in the dense absorbers which they model .",
    "radiative transfer effects obviously modify the form of the uv background prior to reionisation ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , both in ionising radiation above 4 ry and in reprocessed radiation from lyman series and two photon emission .",
    "thus , the uv background could be quite different before reionisation is complete .",
    "we comment on this more in  [ section : ionizing_background ] .",
    "the simulations were all started at @xmath83 , with initial conditions generated using the transfer function of @xcite .",

    "five hydrodynamical simulations , listed in table  [ tab : sims ] , were performed for this study .",
    "the simulations use different models for the thermal and ionisation evolution of the igm , but aside from the s3 model , which we shall discuss later , are identical in all other respects .",
    "the different thermal histories are constructed by increasing the hm01 photo - heating rate in the simulations ( _ e.g. _ t02 ;  @xcite ) .",
    "this mimics spectral hardening due to radiative transfer effects during reionisation by boosting the mean excess energy per photo - ionisation ( @xcite ) .",

    "the study of t02 used hydrodynamical simulations performed with a modified version of the @xmath97 code hydra ( @xcite ) .",
    "hydra employs a single step time integration scheme where all particle positions are advanced on the minimum timestep required throughout the simulation volume .",
    "in contrast , gadget-2 uses individual timesteps for each particle .",

    "this enables efficient use of computational resources and substantially improves code performance .",

    "this can delay the impact photo - heating on the gas and could potentially affect our numerical results .",

    "we find these effects are nevertheless insufficient to reproduce the narrow feature observed in the evolution , suggesting that a sudden increase in the igm temperature at @xmath4 following reionisation is unable to adequately explain the data .",
    "thus far we have established that even in the presence of a sudden increase in the igm temperature at @xmath4 ( but see @xcite ) , the narrow dip observed in the effective optical depth by fg08b can not be reproduced in our hydrodynamical simulations of the forest . however , before proceeding it is worth briefly emphasising that the purported `` narrowness '' of the @xmath63 feature is a somewhat model - dependent statement .",
    "for instance , if we consider the @xmath161 plane , fg08b characterised the width of the feature by fitting a power - law and a gaussian `` bump '' .",

    "in contrast , the fg08b feature stands out visually , and more objective measures we have applied to the data ( _ e.g. _ , a regularised derivative of the data as used in edge - finding algorithms ) tend to confirm that impression .",
    "the fact that it is seen in at least three independent data sets further hints that it is not a data artifact .    additionally , a decomposition into the required evolution in the ionising background ( as in the next section ) will also depend on the assumed igm thermal evolution .",
    "the opacity scales as @xmath162 ; the effect of gas temperature and the photoionisation rate on @xmath63 are impossible to disentangle without independent estimates for one or the other . in this work",
    "we have demonstrated that sudden heating on its own can not reproduce the @xmath63 feature .",
    "however , a sudden global heating event followed by a gradual downturn in the photo - ionisation rate at @xmath163 could still reproduce the data . on the other hand ,",
    "there is good reason to suppose that such a sudden , global boost to the igm temperature is unlikely in the first place .",
    "our previous work has demonstrated that reionisation likely produces too little heating to produce a substantial opacity decrease over the short timescale required @xcite . in the next section",
    "we therefore assume the temperature boost during reionisation occurs over an extended period of time ( our e1 model ) .",
    "this model also resembles the results from recent radiative transfer simulations performed by @xcite .",

    "we have found that , even if the igm temperature increases suddenly , we can not reproduce a narrow feature in the optical depth .",
    "following a sudden temperature increase .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , recent studies indicate that a rapid global temperature boost is unlikely in the first place ( @xcite ) .",
    "] thus a narrow peak at @xmath1 in the otherwise approximately constant value of @xmath175 from @xmath182 is instead required to reproduce the evolution measured by fg08b .",
    "this could be associated with a sharp modulation in the ionising emissivity or the mean free path of ionising photons , or indeed a combination of both effects ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : qgamma ] ) .",
    "however , while appealing to the stellar contribution to the photo - ionisation rate for an increase in the emissivity is in principle acceptable given the uncertainties involved in deriving the stellar ionising rate from observations at @xmath134 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , there is no apparent reason why such a narrow peak should occur at @xmath1 .    instead",
    ", we suggest it is more likely that any modulation of the hydrogen photo - ionisation rate is associated with dense and lyman limit systems .",
    "unlike the low density igm , such systems have dynamical , cooling and recombination times which are comparable or shorter than the @xmath183 years associated with the width of the @xmath63 feature .",
    "they can modulate the hydrogen ionising background , either by changing the hydrogen ionising emissivity ( by the reprocessing of ionising photons into lyman series , balmer , or two - photon emission , all of which can ionise hydrogen ) , or the mean free path of ionising photons , since their opacity will be altered by changes in their size or temperature .",
    "furthermore , a sharp change in the emissivity or opacity will then be imprinted on the ionising background on a timescale comparable to the mean free time of an ionising photon , or @xmath184^{-1 } \\sim 0.24 $ ] where @xmath185^{1.5}$ ] is the abundance of lyman limit systems @xcite , and we assume @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "this is certainly well within the range required to explain the feature .",
    "we now proceed to give some brief examples of these effects .    *",
    "_ helium recombination radiation _",
    "+ a large fraction of the hydrogen ionising background may be radiation from higher frequencies that is reprocessed by dense systems .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that @xmath188 per cent of @xmath189 comes from reprocessed radiation at @xmath190 ; similarly @xcite find that about @xmath191 per cent of @xmath189 comes from reprocessed radiation .",
    "this has two components : recombinations of hydrogen to the ground state , and reprocessing of ionising photons into lyman series , balmer , or two - photon emission , all of which can ionise hydrogen .",
    "the latter obviously undergoes rapid evolution during the process of reionisation , particularly toward the tail end of reionisation when the mean ionising background can rise rapidly ( although there could be large fluctuations in the background throughout the reionisation process ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "recent calculations indicate the contribution of recombination radiation to the uv background could be smaller than previous estimates ( @xcite ) . +",
    "another potentially important effect comes from the reprocessing of lyman series photons in an optically thick igm @xcite .",
    "lyman series photons between ly@xmath192 ( at @xmath193  ry ) and the lyman limit ( 4 ry ) are degraded to ly@xmath65 photons , balmer or lower frequency radiation .",
    "the magnitude of this effect depends strongly on the opacity of the igm , which of course evolves rapidly during reionisation .",
    "while this may not appear to be particularly significant ( since such photons can already ionise hydrogen ) , the degradation to lower energies implies that the hydrogen photo - ionisation rate can be significantly modulated .",
    "in particular , selection rules forbid ly@xmath192 photons from being converted into ly@xmath65 photons , and the reduction of two - photon emission from ly@xmath192 reprocessing at the end of reionisation could reduce the hydrogen ionisation rate , helping to produce the downturn in the photo - ionisation rate . + * _ the size of lyman limit systems _",
    "+ in this work , we have thus far argued that hydrodynamic effects associated with the heating of the igm during reionisation have little effect on @xmath63 . while this is true of the low - density gas responsible for most of the absorption in the forest , it is not true of higher density systems which have smaller dynamical timescales , @xmath194 . since lyman limit systems ( llss ) dominate the opacity of the post - reionisation igm , a sudden change in the sizes of these systems can then modulate the mean free path of ionising photons .",
    "+ we may consider this as follows . at the end of reionisation , although most of the igm has been reheated , self - shielded llss , in which the helium is still predominantly in the form of he  @xmath77 , will still remain .",
    "self - shielding to ionising photons occurs for column densities @xmath195 .",
    "assuming the size of an absorber with overdensity @xmath34 is the local jeans length ( @xcite ) , this column density corresponds to a characteristic overdensity + @xmath196 + where @xmath197 is the photo - ionisation rate .",
    "the column density of an absorber with overdensity @xmath34 is ( @xcite ) + @xmath198 + self - shielding to ionising photons therefore happens at an column density of @xmath199 , well short of the column density of @xmath200 associated with llss .",
    "thus , at face value it may seem that reionisation can not substantially affect llss , and hence the mean free path of ionising photons .",
    "however , llss are also likely to be associated with the less dense outer regions of llss .",
    "a strong increase in external pressure due to the reheating of the igm during reionisation then means that the system will no longer be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the pressure gradient compresses the gas , until pressure equilibrium is once again restored ( a similar mechanism has been invoked for globular cluster formation , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", llss could decrease in size , and increase in density .",
    "alternatively , if hard photons can penetrate and heat the gas in the high density regions ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the lls could instead expand .",
    "+ for simplicity , let us for the moment assume that any change in density occurs isothermally ( see below for more discussion ) . if the absorber expands or contracts to a new overdensity @xmath201 , then ( since @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) , @xmath204 , while the cross - section of the absorber @xmath205 .",
    "assuming that @xmath206 is independent of @xmath34 ( the opacity is dominated by llss , so the result will be most affected by @xmath206 for such systems ) , the mean free path of ionising photons will be altered by a factor + @xmath207}{\\int_{0.1}^{\\infty } f^{-2/3 } \\tau^{-1.5 } \\left [ 1 - { \\rm exp}(- f^{5/3 } \\tau ) \\ , d\\tau \\right]},\\ ] ] + where the lower limit @xmath208 is the optical depth at which systems self - shield from ionising radiation .",
    "this is a non - monotonic function with a minimum at @xmath209 ; however , it does not exceed unity until @xmath210 .",
    "thus , if systems compress , the hydrogen photo - ionisation rate falls ; if they expand , it increases .",
    "however , more quantitative exploration of this possibility requires careful simulation of the lls with coupled hydrodynamics and radiative transfer , particularly since the equilibrium temperature also strongly affects opacity .",
    "in addition , a caveat to this argument is that although the dynamical timescale of an individual lyman limit system is comparable to that required for the modulation of @xmath211 , a globally averaged change in the mean free path still requires the size of all the lyman limit systems to change over a short time interval . + * _ the temperature of lyman limit systems _",
    "+ yet another possibility is that the temperature of llss itself changes during reionisation , altering their opacity .",
    "a rapid increase in the injection of photons at 3 ry from reprocessed radiation implies that the ionising background hardens significantly , which could result in a significant change in the equilibrium temperature .",
    "this could be further modulated by the hydrodynamic effects mentioned above .",
    "note that the equilibrium temperature of llss is a non - trivial function of density in photo - ionisation equilibrium , particularly in the presence of metal line cooling @xcite .",
    "generally , as a system becomes denser , the equilibrium temperature falls , since the efficiency of cooling increases as the ionisation parameter falls @xcite .",
    "this exacerbates the increase in opacity due to the density increase .",
    "non - monotonic evolution of the temperature of the llss ( which have short cooling times since they cool radiatively , rather than adiabatically ) could thus modulate their opacity , as well as the mean free path and the photo - ionisation rate .",
    "we have used a semi - analytic model of inhomogeneous reionisation and high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the forest to investigate the impact of sudden reheating on the evolution of the forest effective optical depth .",
    "our semi - analytic model indicates that any injection of energy into the igm during inhomogeneous reionisation will produce a well understood and generic evolution in @xmath63 , where a reduction in the opacity from @xmath212 to @xmath5 is followed by a gradual , monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low density igm .",
    "this behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow dip ( @xmath213 ) of around 10 per cent in at @xmath1 which has now been detected by three independent observational studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , our semi - analytic model does not include a detailed reconstruction of the forest .",
    "we therefore also analyse five high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the igm to investigate the effect of various thermal histories on the effective optical depth .",
    "we find that sudden reheating at @xmath4 results in a sharp decrease in @xmath63 , although we note that such a large , sudden increase in the igm temperature is nevertheless unlikely to occur over the entire igm at once ( @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption may nevertheless be appropriate in localised regions around quasars with hard spectra , and in small volumes similar to the box size of our hydrodynamical simulations .    although the assumption of sudden , homogeneous reheating does indeed successfully reproduce the initiation of the dip observed by fg08b , our simulations are still unable to account for the rapid _ recovery _ of the narrow dip in the evolution by @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of the 8 per cent increase in the free extra fraction following reionisation on is small , and any resulting increase in is instead countered by the simultaneous flattening of the power - law temperature - density relation during instantaneous , homogeneous reionisation at @xmath4 .",
    "redshift space distortions in the forest attributable to the response of the gas to the extra energy injected into the igm are also unable to account for the observed recovery of @xmath63 .",
    "we find that sudden reheating does indeed produce larger , more positive peculiar velocity gradients corresponding to regions of newly expanding gas , but the absolute changes in the velocity field are generally small in comparison to typical line widths , except in the most overdense regions in the simulation . such regions are , however , rare and thus contribute little to the average opacity .",
    "we have tested the robustness of this result with respect to the time integration scheme employed in gadget-2 , and we find this has little impact on our numerical results .",
    "in contrast , if reionisation is an extended process , then in agreement with the recent study by @xcite we find the effective optical depth will evolve smoothly with redshift .    as a consequence , we must instead appeal to a narrow peak in the metagalactic hydrogen photo - ionisation rate at @xmath1 to reproduce the feature in our simulations .",
    "this could potentially be modulated by lyman limit systems , which have recombination , cooling and dynamical times comparable to or less than the timescale associated with the width of the feature . in particular , we suggest that radiative transfer effects from reionisation itself could be responsible , either by altering the emissivity of reprocessed recombination photons , or by changing the opacity of lyman limit systems and hence the mean free path of ionising photons .",
    "however , further detailed investigation is still required to establish the origin of this intriguing feature in the redshift evolution of the forest opacity .",
