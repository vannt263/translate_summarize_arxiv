    "two decades ago , studies of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicted that quarks and gluons can be liberated from hadrons and , at appropriately high energy densities , a new state of the matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) will be formed @xcite .",

    "nucleus - nucleus collisions can be described by parton interactions in perturbative qcd inspired models @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "hard and semi - hard scatterings among partons dominate the reaction dynamics .",
    "these collisions are able to drive the parton system toward thermal equilibrium very effectively @xcite , but chemical equilibrium may not be established @xcite .",
    "equilibration strongly depends on the actual parton densities in the colliding nuclei and the microscopic processes on the parton level .",
    "the behavior of the parton densities at small @xmath7 is not fully established : newer parametrizations of the parton densities already greatly increase the energy density of the initial state @xcite and the introduction of softer semi - hard scatterings ( a smaller @xmath8 cutoff on the minijet cross section ) could yield a parton system very close to equilibrium a short time after the primary collisions .    during the time - evolution of the parton system , in parallel with the thermalization",
    ", many collective phenomena can appear .",
    "the massless color degrees of freedom , the quarks and gluons , are strongly interacting , as described in the framework of finite temperature qcd @xcite .",
    "in this theory , temperature dependent thermal quark and gluon masses are introduced which can dramatically affect the phenomenological description of the time evolution .",
    "massive fermionic and bosonic excitations can be derived in many ways , _",
    "e.g. _ by considering leading order medium effects on the qcd self - energy @xcite .",
    "since the behavior of the qgp and its high - temperature excitations are not well understood , it is challenging to find measurable tests of this behavior in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in general , open charm @xcite , direct photons and dilepton production @xcite can be used as direct probes of the early parton dynamics and the evolution of the qgp .",
    "primary charm production from the initial nucleon - nucleon collisions has been calculated and can be substantial @xcite , especially when up - to - date parameterizations of the parton densities which increase at low @xmath7 , are used @xcite . in the most recent calculation of initial charm production @xcite in au+au collisions , extrapolated from @xmath9 collisions , a total of 9 ( 450 ) _ initial _",

    "@xcite , shadowing can reduce the yield in the central region by up to a factor of two , depending on the @xmath0 pair mass and transverse momentum .",
    "the amount of secondary charm production in the qgp phase is an open question @xcite .",
    "if the parton system is dilute @xcite , secondary charm production would be suppressed because of the low parton fugacities .",
    "furthermore , at rhic the charm mass is 2 - 3 times larger than the expected temperature scale , @xmath10 gev , and much greater than the bare light quark masses .",
    "thus in this case , even in a fully equilibrated plasma charm production is not significantly enhanced . at the higher lhc energy ,",
    "the predicted initial temperatures , @xmath11 gev , are close to the charm mass .",
    "one can then expect a larger thermal charm production rate than at lower energies , perhaps comparable to the initial yield .",
    "charm production in the plasma by massless quarks and gluons is small because the massless partons must be very energetic to overcome the @xmath0 pair mass threshold .",
    "however , the effective thermal quark and gluon masses generated by the plasma could significantly enhance the thermal charm yield , perhaps even approaching the initial yield after shadowing has been included .",
    "this additional charm production is a possible probe of massive excitations in the qgp which could test the level of thermalization and the evolution of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "furthermore a large charm quark multiplicity would favor the production of exotic phenomena such as multi - charm hadron production @xcite .",
    "the influence of massive gluons on strangeness production has already been investigated @xcite and found to have a negligible influence on the total strangeness production rate . however , that calculation considered massless light quarks and a temperature region , @xmath12 mev , only slightly above @xmath13 . here",

    "the pure gluon system , with its larger @xmath115 , remains above @xmath13 for at least 2.5 fm at rhic .",
    "for both the parton and minijet gas , the higher initial temperatures at the lhc make the finite parton masses more effective in slowing the evolution , in part because the effective parton masses are larger for the higher temperature .",
    "the increase in the number of degrees of freedom between a pure gluon gas and a quark - gluon gas is clearly reflected in the difference between the energy densities of the two systems , shown in figs .",
    "1(c - d ) and 2(c - d ) . note that in both cases at rhic , the energy density of the massive gluon gas is actually reduced relative to the massless gluon gas .",
    "this is due to the temperature gradient of the gluon mass .",
    "a similar effect is also observable in the minijet quark - gluon gas . in all these cases , the temperature is not large compared to the effective masses , causing the reduction . at the much higher temperatures of the lhc ,",
    "although the effective masses are increased , the energy density is increased by the inclusion of the finite parton masses .",
    "we note that at rhic , the energy density of the minijet gas actually drops below 1 gev/@xmath128 for @xmath129 fm , even though the temperature remains above @xmath13 until @xmath127 fm in the quark - gluon system and until @xmath130 fm in the gluon gas .",
    "this suggests that the assumption of an equilibrated minijet gas at rhic is perhaps questionable .",
    "the speed of sound in the medium remains close to that of an ideal gas , as shown in figs .",
    "1(e - f ) and 2(e - f ) . as expected , in the massless gluon case ,",
    "the deviation of the dot - dashed curve from the ideal gas result is due to the finite current strange quark mass even though the light quarks and gluons are massless . in this case",
    ", the system moves further from the ideal gas behavior at later times as the temperature becomes comparable to @xmath132 .",
    "when the system is composed of massive gluons only , the deviation from an ideal gas is largest because the effective gluon mass is larger than the effective quark masses .",
    "the addition of the lighter massive quarks into the system tends to bring the sound speed closer to the ideal gas value . at the lhc",
    ", the higher temperature keeps the system closer to the ideal gas limit than at rhic .",
    "the volume of the system , crucial to the determination of the charm yield , increases as shown in figs .",
    "1(g - h ) and 2(g - h ) .",
    "since the volume depends on the rapidity extent of the plasma , the relatively lower energy density and pressure of the gluon gas require a larger spatial extent to ensure that the energy of the system is equal to @xmath112 .",
    "because we have changed the initial conditions according to the composition of the minijet gas , the volume changes less than the parton gas volume .",
    "in this section , we present our results on the @xmath0 production rates .",
    "the parton gas produces the largest @xmath0 yield because of the slower time evolution demonstrated in the previous section .",
    "since the time evolution of the quark and gluon effective masses determines the relative enhancement of charm production by the massive excitations , we show the time dependence of the effective masses in a quark - gluon system in fig .",
    "the finite current strange quark mass at zero temperature results in a slightly higher effective strange quark mass compared to the effective light quark mass .",
    "it also reduces the time dependence of the strange quark effective mass .",
    "the larger slope of the gluon effective mass as a function of temperature results in a faster decrease in gluon mass as a function of time . we have shown the effective masses for as long as @xmath133  the minijet gas at rhic is at @xmath13 when @xmath134 fm . at later times ,",
    "the finite masses become less effective for producing charm .",
    "we remark that the running coupling constant , @xmath135 , is also a function of time .",
    "the weaker coupling at later times also reduces the yield .",
    "the initial rate is approximately a factor of two larger when the quark degrees of freedom are included . at the beginning of the evolution ,",
    "the rate is nearly independent of the initial parton mass .",
    "however , since the system cools more slowly with massive initial partons , the rate is larger at later times in the massive case .",

    "charm production only occurs during the early part of the evolution . at rhic , production by the parton gas",
    "is essentially over after @xmath136 fm while production from the minijet gas is ended by @xmath137 fm .",
    "note however , that @xmath0 pairs continue to be produced at much later times when the partons are massive , especially at the lhc .",
    "this is particularly true for the massive quark - gluon gas .",

    "the parton gas results are given in fig .",
    "4(a - b ) and 5(a - b ) . here ,",
    "although the production rate is larger when both quarks and gluons are included , the final number of @xmath0 pairs produced during the evolution of the system does not strongly depend on the composition of the plasma at rhic because the larger rate is compensated by a correspondingly smaller volume .",
    "the yield from a massless quark - gluon gas is about 15% larger than that from a massless gluon gas . for massive initial quarks and gluons ,",
    "the difference in the composition changes the yield by only 8% , as seen in table 1 .",
    "when @xmath138 gev , the yield is increased 44% for a massive gluon gas relative to a massless gluon gas and 32% in the massive quark - gluon system . if @xmath139 gev , the enhancement due to the massive partons is reduced to 36% for the gluons alone and to 29% for the quark - gluon gas .",
    "the yield at the lower mass is about 3.5 times larger than when @xmath140 gev .",
    "some of the enhancement can be accounted for by the slower temperature evolution .",
    "after the system has evolved for 10 fm , the temperature of the massive gluon gas is approximately 10% larger than the massless gas .",

    "the thermal charm yield from the minijet gas is thus negligible compared to the initial charm rate @xcite .",
    "the influence of the massive partons is also reduced for the minijet gas . for @xmath138",
    "gev , the yield is only increased over the massless case by 23% in a gluon gas and 14% in a quark - gluon gas .",
    "the influence of the charm mass on the yield is also stronger for the minijet gas  the yield decreases by a factor of 4 - 5 with the larger charm mass .",
    "the enhancement due to the effective parton mass is more substantial at the lhc , as seen in figs .  6 and 7 and in table 2 .",
    "the massive quarks and gluons have a more significant effect on the temperature evolution of the parton gas .",
    "the temperature is 27% higher after 10 fm with massive gluons and 20% higher for massive quarks and gluons .",
    "the enhancement of the yield is also larger : when @xmath141 gev , the yield is 94% larger in the gluon gas and 70% higher in the quark - gluon gas .",
    "increasing the charm mass only reduces the total yield by a factor of 2.5 , thus the yield is less dependent on the charm mass at the higher temperature . note",
    "that here the charm yield from the massive quark - gluon system , 250 pairs after 10 fm , is similar to the initial nucleon - nucleon rate @xcite .",
    "the minijet gas is more effective at producing charm at lhc than at rhic .",
    "although the initial time remains short , @xmath115 is 40% larger in the minijet gluon gas and 10% larger in the minijet quark - gluon gas than in the parton gas .",
    "therefore the minijet charm yield is only a factor of two to six smaller than the parton gas yield and the minijet thermal charm yield also becomes a significant fraction of the initial production .",
    "note also that the enhancement due to the massive partons is largest in the minijet gluon gas  a factor of 2.5 increase over that from a gas of massless gluons because the temperature of the massive gluon gas is 50% larger .    in ref .",

    "the initial temperature was nearly the same as the parton gas @xmath115 used here but the initial time was closer to that of the minijet gas , @xmath143 .",
    "however , a larger , constant , @xmath144 kept the yield from being reduced . when initial conditions identical to those used here are chosen for the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the results are quite similar . while the details of the expansion are somewhat different , we have checked that our massless charm production cross sections are in exact agreement with those in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to study the dependence of the enhancement on the charm pair mass",
    ", we also calculate the thermal charm pair mass distributions for rhic in fig .  8 and for the lhc in fig .",
    "9 . generally , the thermal charm mass distributions are steeper than those charm pairs produced in the initial nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for the initial charm pair mass distributions . )",
    "the shapes of the mass distributions for each of the four cases we have studied with our two sets of initial conditions are quite similar , especially for the parton gas where @xmath115 is the same in all cases .",
    "the shapes of the distributions from the minijet gas at rhic are also similar although the initial yield is larger from the gluon gas because of its higher @xmath115 .",
    "the enhancement is generally largest for low mass charm pairs , not far above threshold . at lhc ,",
    "where the enhancement is greatest , the distributions with the massive excitations included approach the mass distributions for the massless case only at @xmath145 gev .",
    "we have investigated a new mechanism for enhancing thermal charm production by a quark - gluon plasma : massive excitations in the plasma state .",
    "we chose two different sets of initial conditions , a parton gas and a minijet gas , and calculated the thermal charm yield from each for both massless and massive quarks and gluons . in our calculation",
    "we assumed that the system stayed in thermal and chemical equilibrium during the expansion .",
    "therefore , our charm yield is an upper bound on secondary charm production .",
    "the largest charm production was found when a parton gas was assumed because the characteristic thermalization time was @xmath146 fm .",
    "then the parton gas lifetime was long , more then 10 fm .",
    "at rhic we obtained a 30 - 40% enhancement with massive gluons and quarks while at the lhc , a 50 - 100% enhancement may be expected . with @xmath1 gev , the charm mass used in recent calculations ,",
    "we obtained 4.9 secondary charm quark pairs at rhic and 245 charm pairs at lhc .",
    "note that these numbers , upper limits on secondary charm production , are similar to the expected initial charm production @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath90 gev , secondary charm pair production is reduced to 1.3 pairs at rhic and 94 pairs at lhc .",
    "the lifetime of the minijet gas was significantly shorter than the parton gas due to the short thermalization time , @xmath147 fm .",
    "this difference strongly reduced the charm yield from the minijet gas compared to the parton gas .",
    "the typical lifetime of the minijet gas was of order 2.5 fm although at rhic the temperature of the quark - gluon gas dropped below @xmath13 after only 1.5 fm .",
    "the fast expansion reduces the influence of the massive quasi - particles at rhic where the initial temperature of the minijet gas was also smaller than the initial temperature of the parton gas .",
    "the enhancement was typically 20% with massive quarks and gluons but the total yield , 0.016 pairs from the quark - gluon gas , was very small compared to the initial charm rate .",
    "although the expansion was also fast at the lhc , the much higher initial temperature , @xmath148 gev , generated large charm production rates . with @xmath1",
    "gev we obtained 38 secondary charm quark pairs from a quark - gluon gas and 100 pairs from a gluon gas while with @xmath139 gev , the yield was 16 and 47 pairs respectively . note that the minijet gluon gas result is only a factor of two smaller than the corresponding parton gas yield at lhc .",
    "our results show that , regardless of the initial conditions , the massive excitations of the quarks and gluons significantly enhance charm production by the plasma . introducing thermal gluon and quark",
    "masses slowed the expansion of the system .",
    "the longer lifetime of the plasma as well as the reduced threshold for charm production with massive quarks and gluons leads to an enhancement of charm production over the massless case .",
    "thus charm enhancement in heavy ion collisions could be an excellent probe of the presence of collective excitations in the deconfined plasma .",
    "if such enhanced charm production , beyond that predicted from the initial nucleon - nucleon collisions is observed , it could be expected that other exotic phenomena due to massive quark and gluon excitations may be found .",
