    "following the suggestion of  ( 1986 ) , several groups are now engaged in searches for dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) using gravitational microlensing , and many candidate microlensing events have been reported .",
    "reviews of microlensing in this context are given by  ( 1996 ) and roulet & mollerach ( 1996 ) .",
    "previously @xcite we conducted an analysis of 2.1 years of photometry of 8.5 million stars , and found 68 microlensing events , implying an optical depth towards the lmc of @xmath11 for the 8-event sample and @xmath12 for the 6-event sample ( @xcite , hereafter  & , respectively )",
    ". interpreted as evidence for a macho contribution to the milky way dark halo , this implied a macho mass out to 50 kpc of @xmath13 .",
    "depending on the halo model this meant a macho halo fraction of between 15% and 100% , and a typical macho mass of 0.1 to 1 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the eros group has reported 2 candidates @xcite , consistent with the above results .",
    "recently the eros s updated and expanded survey , erosii , has reported two new events that they interpret as limiting the amount of halo dark matter @xcite , but are consistent with both  and the results of this paper .",
    "the ogle @xcite collaboration also reported one lmc microlensing event in 1999 .",
    "all claimed lmc events have characteristic timescales between @xmath15 and @xmath16 days , while searches for short - timescale events with timescales 1 hour @xmath17 10 days have revealed no candidates to date @xcite allowing important limits to be set on low mass dark matter .",
    "in addition , two candidates have been observed towards the smc @xcite , but the small number of events , location of the lenses , and large expected smc self lensing rate reduce their usefulness as a probe of the dark halo .",
    "conclusions based on our previous work suffered due to poisson error as a result of the small number of events . increasing the time span monitored from 2.1 years to 5.7 years and increasing the number of monitored fields from 22 to 30 , gives 13 to 17 events ( depending on the cuts used ) , as well as greatly increases our sensitivity to long duration events and therefore to higher mass machos .",
    "it also increases coverage over the face of the lmc , providing a useful tool to distinguish between various interpretations of the microlensing events .",
    "in addition , while our previous analyses contained the most careful evaluations of microlensing detection efficiency ever done , we have made several important improvements , and have thoroughly tested the robustness of our methods .",
    "in addition we have more fully and carefully investigated sources of potential background to microlensing , in particular lmc variable star background ( i.e. , bumpers ) and supernovae in galaxies behind the lmc .",
    "for example , one candidate event classified in a97 as microlensing ( lmc-10 ) is now removed as a probable background supernova .",
    "the nature of microlensing implies that many of our events will be low signal - to - noise , so to test the robustness of our results and to estimate systematic error due to our event selection methodology , we present two independently derived sets of selection criteria , with two corresponding sets of events and efficiency determinations .",
    "one set is designed to select only high signal - to - noise events and is modeled on the selection criteria used in .",
    "the other is designed to be inclusive of lower signal - to - noise events and also exotic microlensing events , and makes heavier use of several new statistics .",
    "while the number of microlensing candidate events selected by the two sets of cuts differ , the corresponding efficiencies compensate , and the resulting optical depth values , halo fractions , etc .",
    "are essentially the same .",
    "this suggests that the systematic error in our optical depth , etc . due to",
    "our choice of cuts is small .",
    "finally , we implement an improved likelihood analysis that self - consistently incorporates currently available information on known stellar backgrounds .    the increase in number of events , improved efficiency determination , and more thorough investigation of systematic errors and backgrounds , such as bumpers and supernovae ,",
    "makes the results of this paper the most accurate to date . at this point , uncertainties in the model of the milky way and the model of the lmc",
    "dominate both the quantitative and interpretational aspects of microlensing as a probe of dark matter .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec - obs ] we outline the observations and photometric reductions . in   [ sec - det ]",
    "we describe our microlensing event selection criteria , present the resulting candidates , and discuss several sources of background to microlensing , including bumpers and supernovae . in   [ sec - eff ] we estimate our detection efficiency , which has been improved in a number of ways . in   [ sec - dist ]",
    "we show the distributions of the selected events in the color - magnitude diagram , location on the sky , and impact parameter .",
    "we compare with predicted distributions , thereby testing the microlensing hypothesis . in ",
    "[ sec - implic ] we provide various analyses of the sample .",
    "we calculate the optical depth , and discuss why it is a factor of two smaller than in .",
    "we perform a likelihood analysis that explicitly includes models of the milky way and lmc stellar populations to find new estimates of the macho contribution to the dark halo and the number of expected events from known stellar populations .",
    "we find new favorable mass ranges for the lenses if they are halo objects .",
    "we also discuss various interpretations of our results , including the possibility that no machos exist and all the lensing is due to stellar lenses .",
    "note that many of the reduction and analysis procedures used here are very similar to those in  & , to which we refer extensively .",
    "a more rigorous description of our detection efficiency , which is only briefly outlined in this paper , may be found in the companion paper , alcock  ( 2000a ) , and in vandehei ( 2000 ) .",
    "the reader is encouraged to consult these papers to understand the details of the experiment , but we will repeat the main points here for clarity .",
    "the macho project has had full - time use of the @xmath18-meter telescope at mount stromlo observatory , australia , since 1992 july .",
    "observations are scheduled to be completed at the end of 1999 december .",
    "details of the telescope system are given by hart ( 1996 ) and of the camera system by stubbs ( 1993 ) and marshall ( 1994 ) .",
    "briefly , corrective optics and a dichroic are used to give simultaneous imaging of a @xmath19 arcmin@xmath20 field in two colors , using eight @xmath21 pixel ccds . as of 1998 march , over",
    "70,000 exposures had been taken with the system , over 5 tbytes of raw image data .",
    "about @xmath22 are of the lmc , the rest are of fields in the galactic center and smc .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the first 5.7 years of data from 30 well - sampled fields , located in the central @xmath23 of the lmc ; field centers are listed in table  [ tab - fields ] , and shown in figure  [ fig - lmc ] .",
    "the observations described here comprise 21,570 images distributed over the 30 fields .",
    "these include most of our observations of these fields in the time span of 2067 days from 1992 september 18 to 1998 march 17 as well as a fraction of our observations taken between 1992 july 22 and 1992 august 23 when our system was still in an engineering phase .",
    "the mean number of exposures per field is @xmath24 , with a range from 180 to 1338 .",
    "the sampling varies between fields ( table  [ tab - fields ] ) , since the higher priority fields were often observed twice per night with an average of about 4 hours between exposures .",
    "the photometric reduction procedure was very similar to that described in  & ; briefly , a good - quality image of each field is chosen as a template and used to generate a list of stellar positions and magnitudes .",
    "the templates are used to `` warm - start '' all subsequent photometric reductions , and for each star we record information on the flux , an error estimate , the object type , the @xmath25 of the point spread function ( psf ) fit , a crowding parameter , a local sky level , and the fraction of the star s flux rejected due to bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "details of the macho image data and photometry code ( sodophot ) are provided in alcock  ( 1999c ) .",
    "the resulting data are reorganized into lightcurves , and searched for variable stars and microlensing events .",
    "the lmc 5.7-year photometry database is about 200 gbytes in size .",
    "for the 22 fields reported on in , we have well calibrated photometry @xcite , but for the eight new fields our photometry has been only roughly calibrated on a global basis ( see   2 in ) .",
    "event selection is generally based on this rough calibration , but as noted below , we report the well calibrated magnitudes and colors when possible .",
    "we have corrected a minor complication in  where , for software - related reasons , we had used different templates for the first and second year s reductions of 6 of our fields . for these fields",
    "there was not a one - to - one correspondence between the set of stars in the 2 distinct years used , and the first and second years had to be analyzed separately .",
    "all photometry in these 6 fields have been re - run using the new generation of templates and the lightcurves have now been merged onto a common photometric system .",
    "the data set used here consists of about 256 billion individual photometric measurements . discriminating genuine microlensing from stellar variability , background , and systematic photometry errors is hard , and the significance of the results depends upon the event selection criteria .",
    "the selection criteria should accept ` true ' microlensing events , and reject events due to intrinsic stellar variability and instrumental effects .",
    "the determination of our event selection criteria could not be made before looking in detail at the lightcurves .",
    "we had to discover various background sources and learn how to perform event selection from the data we gather itself , making the selection criteria dependent on the data .",
    "as much as possible we have tried to base the selection criteria upon our monte carlo artificial events ( see   [ sec - eff ] ) . although this allows us to place cuts along natural breaks in parameter space ( which lessens the sensitivity of the final results on the exact placement of the cut ) it did not allow us to fully explore the background of variable stars .",
    "this adds some subjectivity to our analysis , which we quantify below by considering two limiting cases .    for each lightcurve , we compute a set of over 150 temporal variability statistics .",
    "we use two levels of statistics : level-1 statistics are calculated for all stars , while level-2 statistics are calculated only for those stars that pass the level-1 selection criteria .",
    "we have developed selection criteria (  cuts \" ) that use the level-2 statistics to distinguish microlensing from backgrounds such as variable stars and noise .",
    "the selection criteria have evolved over the course of the experiment . as the volume of data on a lightcurve increases , the meaning of some statistics change in subtle ways .",
    "thus one must be careful not to blindly apply selection criteria from one data set to another .",
    "for example , a fit @xmath25 to a constant flux star over 2.1 years of data will not necessarily be the same when computed using 5.7 years of data , due to changes in weather patterns ( and thus seeing & sky level ) and the ccd camera over the course of the experiment .",
    "in addition , in order to increase our sensitivity to low signal - to - noise and exotic microlensing , our level 1 criteria ( see below ) have been loosened relative to those used in .",
    "this means that our set of level-1 candidates contains more variable stars and other noisy events , thus requiring changes to the final level-2 selection criteria .",
    "because of the changes in the level-1 criteria , the selection criteria used in  are no longer appropriate for the year 5.7 data .",
    "about 45 lightcurves , 26 of which are clearly noise or variable stars , would pass the  criteria applied to the current data .",
    "we select the events using two different and independently developed sets of level-2 selection criteria .",
    "this allows us to explore possible systematic error due to the choice of cuts . while the goal of both sets of cuts is to select as many microlensing lightcurves as possible , while rejecting as many non - microlensing lightcurves as possible , the two sets of cuts were explicitly developed with complementary philosophies in mind .",
    "the first selection criteria ( hereafter referred to as criteria a ) was designed to be rather tight , only accepting events with a single highly significant bump in either passband , while requiring the baseline to remain very flat , as expected in simple microlensing .",
    "these cuts resemble those in  and for the most part statistics similar to those described in  were employed .",
    "the second selection criteria ( criteria b ) was designed to be rather loose , in an attempt to search for exotic or low signal - to - noise microlensing candidates .",
    "this second set of cuts also looked for a single significant bump in either passband with a flat baseline , but made use of some new statistics not available in .",
    "the new statistics ( described below ) better characterize and filter out some variable stars and noisy events . to conservatively estimate the subjective nature of our event selection , marginal events suspected of being supernova , etc .",
    "are preferentially rejected from set a , but kept in set b.    note that as long as the experiment s event detection efficiency is calculated properly , and the selection criteria are sufficiently stringent to accept only real microlensing events , changes in the selection criteria should be accounted for in the efficiency calculations , and the details should not greatly affect the final results ( in the limit of a large number of detected events ) .",
    "this statement implicitly ignores exotic microlensing events such as binary lens or parallax microlensing events which have lightcurves that differ from those used in our efficiency determination .",
    "we have not determined our efficiency for exotic events , but selection criteria b is designed , in part , to be more sensitive to such events .",
    "furthermore , a much more sensitive search for exotic lensing events has been carried out , and none were found .",
    "so , we do expect that the difference between selection criteria a & b is a reasonable indication of our selection criteria systematic error , and we find that this difference is fairly small as outlined here and discussed in ",
    "[ sec - implic ] .",
    "we have summarized the old ( ) and new selection criteria ( a & b ) in table  [ tab - cuts ] . in   [ sec - cuts ]",
    "we briefly describe some of the analysis and statistics used by these selection criteria and in   [ sec - events ]",
    "we present the set of events selected by criteria a & b. in   [ sec - background ] we identify two main sources of background to microlensing and discuss how they can be removed from the true microlensing pool .",
    "finally , in   [ sec - nevents ] we remove our identified background events and summarize the final sets of microlensing candidates ( the final set a & b ) used to compute the results of this paper .",
    "photometric measurements with questionable psf fit , too much crowding , missing pixels , or cosmic rays are flagged as suspect and removed from further consideration .",
    "the event detection then proceeds in two stages .",
    "the first stage , defining a level-1 collection of candidate events , is similar to that described in ; a set of matched filters of timescales 7 , 15 , 45 , and 100 days is run over each lightcurve .",
    "if after convolution , a lightcurve shows a peak above a pre - defined significance level in either color , it is defined as a ` level-1 candidate ' .",
    "we also make use of a new filter that looks for bumps of any duration and add these lightcurves to the level-1 pool of candidates .",
    "( we found no additional candidates by this change , however . ) for level-1 candidates , a full 5-parameter fit to microlensing is made , and many level-2 statistics describing the significance of the deviation , goodness of fit , etc .",
    "are calculated .",
    "we use the standard point - source , point - lens approximation @xcite .",
    "the 5 free parameters of the fit are the baseline flux in red and blue passbands @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the 3 parameters of the microlensing event : the minimum impact parameter in units of the einstein radius , @xmath28 , the einstein diameter crossing time , @xmath29 , and the time of maximum magnification , @xmath30 .",
    "later , instead of @xmath28 we will often use the fit maximum magnification @xmath31 , which is more closely related to the observed light curve .",
    "lightcurves passing loose cuts on these statistics are defined as ` level-1.5 ' candidates , and are output as individual files along with their associated statistics . in the present analysis , there are approximately 150,000 level-1.5 candidates , almost all of which are variable stars or noise .",
    "some of the important statistics used by both criteria a & b are the chi - squares of various fits .",
    "for example , a powerful signal - to - noise statistic is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath25 values for the constant flux and microlensing fits , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is the effective ` significance ' of the event summed over all data points .",
    "@xmath36 refers to the @xmath25 of the microlensing fit in the  peak \" region where @xmath37 .",
    "a reduced @xmath25 of the microlensing fit outside the interval @xmath38 is also computed , @xmath39 .",
    "other useful statistics include the average values of crowding for a star , the microlensing fit values , the magnitude and color , the number of 2-sigma high points in the peak region , the number of points on the rising and falling side of the peak region , and the number of points outside the peak region .    based upon our experience gained in  &  we have developed a number of new statistics .",
    "one such statistic is the fraction of points in the peak that lie above the lightcurve s median , @xmath40 .",
    "this new statistic is useful for removing events with spurious deviant points associated with crowding / seeing induced fluctuations , satellite / asteroid tracks and other causes . to further help in removing similar spurious events we also compute the fraction of points in the peak rejected due to bad psf measurements , @xmath41 , and large crowding values , @xmath42 .",
    "we have found it beneficial to concentrate on statistics that help in rejecting variable star background .",
    "one such statistic is the ratio of powers in the two passbands , @xmath43 .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 is the sum of the absolute values of the flux away from the median in the blue bandpass , and likewise for @xmath45 for the red bandpass .",
    "our variable star background generally has more power in the red than in the blue , while our monte carlo microlensing events tend to have equal power in both passbands , even when heavily blended ( that this is the case is not surprising given the fact that the color difference between any two stars in the lmc is somewhat restricted )",
    ". a second new statistic on the ratio of powers in each filter , @xmath46 is also computed , but uses only points measured simultaneously in both filters and is thus normalized differently than @xmath43 . to further help reject variable stars we compute a cross - correlation coefficient between the red & blue filters , @xmath47 , but use only data points that are outside the peak of the event , @xmath48 , to avoid the peak contributing .",
    "a powerful new statistic for rejecting variable stars is a robust reduced chi - square fit to a constant flux , @xmath49 , also computed outside the interval @xmath48 .",
    "another new signal - to - noise statistic we compute is @xmath50 , which is a @xmath25 from the baseline counting only upward excursions in the filter window and subtracting a penalty per measurement in the bin so that 2-sigma points break even .",
    "we subtract the largest single date contribution ( 1 or 2 points ) to ensure robustness against single strongly deviant observations .",
    "we also compute a similar @xmath25 for the second most significant non - overlapping filter trigger , @xmath51 .",
    "the statistic @xmath50 is very similar to @xmath52 , and a comparison of the two on both real data and artificial data yields similar results , even though the latter is derived using the microlensing shape .",
    "this gives us added confidence that a cut on @xmath52 is not very ` shape ' dependent .",
    "we have opted to use @xmath52 throughout , but make use of the second peak significant @xmath51 to ensure the uniqueness of the event .",
    "this statistic is useful for eliminating variable stars , but must be used with caution to avoid missing exotic lensing events such as binary lenses or sources that could exhibit a second ` bump ' .",
    "similarly , cuts on @xmath53 and @xmath49 could potentially bias against detecting widely separated binary microlenses .",
    "we ran our selection criteria with and without these cuts to ensure that no exotic lensing events were missed .",
    "no additional candidates were found .",
    "our set a selection criteria are designed to accept high quality microlensing candidates , while using mainly the statistics described in .",
    "some of the cuts on these statistics have been loosened as we have developed a better understanding of our variable star background ; for example the cut on magnification was loosened from @xmath54 to its present value @xmath55 , because our main background of variable stars , a class of blue variables called bumpers ( see below ) , almost never show fit magnifications larger than 1.5 , and are well isolated in the color magnitude diagram .",
    "we also loosened our main significance cut @xmath56 ( from 500 in ) because a number of other statistics were tightened .",
    "these include , @xmath57 ( from @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average red / blue error in magnitudes ) which is a signal - to - noise cut , @xmath60 to reject variables ( from @xmath61 in ) and @xmath62 ( from @xmath63 in ) , another signal - to - noise cut .",
    "this later cut is somewhat more reliant on the shape of the 5 parameter microlensing fit and increases the likelihood of rejecting exotic microlensing ; for this reason , criteria b below does not use this cut .",
    "our set b selection criteria are designed to accept any lightcurves with a significant unique peak and a fairly flat baseline .",
    "our selection criteria b are summarized in figure  [ fig - cuts ] which illustrates our two most important signal - to - noise cuts : the cut on magnification @xmath64 and the cut on @xmath65 .",
    "events that passed the basic cuts ( all cuts used by criteria b minus the ordinate & abscissa cuts of figure  [ fig - cuts ] ) are shown as solid dots and labeled .",
    "the final cut on magnification @xmath64 and @xmath65 are shown as solid lines ( for comparison dotted lines for criteria a are also illustrated ) .",
    "open circles indicate events which fail criteria b s bumper cut and solid squares events which fail criteria b s uniqueness cut .",
    "the new statistics on the number of points rejected in the peak region , @xmath66 , and the fraction of points above the baseline in the peak , @xmath40 are useful for eliminating spurious noise - induced events .",
    "new statistics on uniqueness , @xmath51 , the passband power ratio @xmath46 , the red / blue cross - correlation coefficient outside the peak @xmath47 , and the robust @xmath49 baseline statistic are useful in removing periodic and quasi - periodic variable stars .",
    "we have also more carefully characterized our main source of variable star background , the bumpers , in a magnitude  color  magnification space ( see figure  [ fig - cmd - cuts ] ) . with the background of variable stars",
    "more effectively removed we can reduce both our reliance on any ` shape ' dependent criteria and lower the significance level of a detection . in ",
    "[ sec - eff ] we demonstrate the relative looseness of criteria b over a as well as the decreased dependence on shape . however , one potential difficulty with criteria b is its inability to discriminate against some types of variable stars , such as cvs and sns , that might exhibit strongly asymmetric and/or chromatic lightcurves during the ` event ' but remain constant for long periods of time .",
    "supernova removal is discussed separately in more detail below .",
    "see table  [ tab - cuts ] for a complete list of the individual cuts used by selection criteria a and b.      we find 19 lightcurves that pass criteria a and 29 lightcurves that pass criteria b ( before applying the supernova cuts described below ) .",
    "all the lightcurves passing criteria a also pass criteria b. the 29 lightcurves are shown in figure  [ fig - events ] and their microlensing fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab - events ] .",
    "events that do not pass criteria a are marked with an asterisk .",
    "parameters for fits including the possibility of blending with an unlensed star in the same seeing disk as the lensed star are given in table  [ tab - blend ] .",
    "the unblended fits are displayed as a thick line in figure  [ fig - events ] , used for all statistics except comparison with supernova .",
    "note that our events here are numbered as in  to avoid any possible ambiguity .",
    "thus the first event described here that was not described in  is event  13 .",
    "finding charts for the events , as well as the full lightcurves can be found on the internet at    six of these 29 lightcurves ( 1a , 1b , 10a , 10b , 12a and 12b ) actually correspond to only three stars that occur in field overlap regions ; the two lightcurves for each star are based on independent data and reductions .",
    "two lightcurves are also of the same star ( 7a and 7b ) but were not in field overlaps .",
    "event  7 was bright enough and in a locally crowded enough region that some of the flux from the primary ( 7a ) contaminated a secondary ( 7b ) neighbor causing a spurious detection .",
    "event  7a passed both criteria a & b , while event  7b passed only criteria b due to its low signal - to - noise .",
    "thus before supernova removal there are 16 unique events found by the criteria a , and 25 unique events found by the criteria b.        as noted in  a potential source of background to microlensing is a class of bright blue variables which we refer to as bumpers .",
    "although associated with be stars , which are known to show periodic outbursts in our galaxy , the true nature of these variable stars is still unknown .",
    "however , it is possible to eliminate bumpers as a serious source of background as they can be well isolated in a multi - parameter space .",
    "for example , microlensing fits to bumpers seen in our data almost never return magnifications larger than 1.5 , typically much less , as can be seen in figure  [ fig - cuts ] ( open circles ) .",
    "one does not have to be confined to magnifications above 1.5 as the bumpers are also well isolated in the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as illustrated in figure  [ fig - cmd - cuts ] . here",
    "a typical cmd of the lmc is shown with a scattering of small dots .",
    "the 29 lightcurves that pass selection criteria b are shown as filled circles and labeled .",
    "as in figure  [ fig - cuts ] open circles indicate events which fail criteria b s bumper cut .",
    "filled boxes indicate events which fail criteria b s magnification cut @xmath67 .",
    "the final cut on brightness @xmath68 and color  magnitude  magnification ( the ` bumper ' cut ) are marked as solid lines for criteria b ( for comparison the dotted line illustrates the ` bumper ' cut for criteria a ) .",
    "if a potential event falls within the boxed region labeled ` @xmath54 ' then it must have a magnification greater then 1.75 to be included in the criteria b set of events .",
    "we have visually inspected the @xmath69 bumper candidate lightcurves and confirm that the vast majority of them show the slight asymmetry and other characteristics typical of the bumpers described in .",
    "in fact , due to the cut on uniqueness these bumpers have only single bumps and evidently represent one - time only bumpers or bumpers with inter - bump intervals longer than 5.7 years .",
    "another serious source of potential contamination in microlensing surveys , that has not been given sufficient attention before , are supernovae ( sn ) occurring in galaxies behind the lmc .",
    "these background sn are picked up in the crowded fields , and their host galaxies are not always easy to identify in ground ",
    "based images .",
    "the fact that they occur only once and show a flat baseline before and after the ` event ' make sn interlopers a serious concern .",
    "a first step in understanding this source of contamination is to estimate the number of sn we might see during the course of the experiment . because of the recent interest in sn type ia as standard candles , the rate of sn ( both type i and ii ) occurring in field galaxies is now fairly well known .",
    "we use a typical rate of 0.5 sn / year/@xmath70 with peak magnitude brighter than @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the duration of the experiment is 5.7 years and covers 13.5 @xmath70 , which suggests we should have approximately 38 sn in our data set .",
    "this does not include our sn detection efficiency and so is an overestimate .",
    "we expect our efficiency for detecting sn to be on the order of 5 - 15% , similar to that of detecting microlensing events ( see   [ sec - eff ] ) , due to the similar shapes of the corresponding lightcurves , implying we are likely to see @xmath72 sn in the current data set .",
    "if the density of galaxies behind the lmc is average , then the probability of finding a galaxy in proximity of a star should be low .",
    "therefore , a robust way of eliminating potential sn interlopers would be a search for a background host galaxy in an image .",
    "if such a galaxy were found within a pre - determined radius , the microlensing interpretation would be unlikely .",
    "since the area covered by nearby galaxies is small , the correction to our experimental efficiency would be small .",
    "unfortunately , our ground  based images do not have the resolution and low enough sky count to perform such a search with confidence .",
    "we do have hst observations of 8 of our events ( see table  [ tab - summary ] ) and these give us high confidence that 6 of them are not sn as there are no obvious background galaxies anywhere near these events .",
    "two events for which we have an hst image ( events  10 and 12 ) do show a fairly bright spiral galaxy within 5 arcsecs .",
    "in retrospect , the host galaxy for event  10 shows up in our ground  based images but could not have been recognized as a galaxy without further data .",
    "this event was noticeably asymmetric in  and was classified as a marginal microlensing candidate . in calculating the optical depth , it was rejected from the 6 event sample , but included in the 8 event sample . although the effect of its inclusion was small , increasing the reported optical depth of the 8 event sample by only 7% , its presence underscores the need to take the potential sn contamination seriously .    unfortunately , with an incomplete sample of hst images we are unable to follow the above prescription to reject sn interlopers completely .",
    "we have requested hst time to observe the remaining events , and have examined the best available ground based images for evidence of a background galaxy .",
    "however , we can also use the shape of the lightcurve to help distinguish sn from microlensing . even though the lightcurves of sn type ii are not well understood and exhibit a wide range of behavior , sn of type ia have been studied in detail .",
    "their lightcurves are very similar once distance , reddening , and a shape parameter are allowed for @xcite . in addition , type ia s probably dominate the sn rate in flux limited samples @xcite . using the sn type ia templates of riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) transformed to the macho photometric system ,",
    "we have applied a 6 parameter sn type ia fit to all 29 lightcurves .",
    "the 6 free parameters of the fit are the baseline flux of the photometered object in red and blue passbands @xmath26 , @xmath73 , and 4 parameters that describe the sn type ia lightcurve : the time of peak @xmath74 , the distance modulus in red band @xmath75 and blue band @xmath76 ( fit independently to account for the possibility of reddening ) and a shape parameter @xmath77 which parameterizes how sn of type ia become longer in duration when intrinsically brighter .",
    "emperically , we discovered that by allowing any acceptable value of @xmath77 , in many cases our best fit sn shape was well outside the range of observed sn ( e.g. @xmath78 ) .",
    "this was especially true for high - quality microlensing events , where the sn template provides a poor fit to the shape of the lightcurve .",
    "we therefore limit our range in @xmath77 to be between -0.5 and 0.75 , and note that for most of the events with poor sn fits , we find @xmath77 pegged at one of these values .",
    "the sn type ia fits are displayed as a dashed line for the events we categorize ( see below ) as sn in figure  [ fig - events ] and the fit parameters for all 29 lightcurves are given in table  [ tab - sn ] .",
    "we summarize all the relevant available information for the 29 events in table  [ tab - summary ] .",
    "columns 2 - 4 compare the blended microlensing fits @xmath79 with the sn type ia fits @xmath80 .",
    "a positive value of @xmath81 indicates a better fit to blended microlensing , while a negative value a better fit to sn type ia .",
    "inspection of table  [ tab - summary ] reveals 10 lightcurves ( 8 events ) that are better fit by sn type ia . as a consistency check column 5 indicates the presence or absence of an obvious background galaxy within @xmath82 arcsecs as determined using the best available image of the event ( image source given ) .",
    "this background galaxy identification is subjective .",
    "part of the problem is the severe crowding of the ground - based images used ( macho or ctio images ) . in every case , where a galaxy is probably present the fit to a sn type ia template is preferred over the blended fit , giving us some assurances of the overall correctness of the procedure .",
    "we have no spectra to confirm the hypotheses that any of these 8 events are , in fact , sn of type ia . but given the fact that we should see 26 sn in our survey we feel it is nevertheless prudent to eliminate these 8 events as potential interlopers .",
    "we thus implement as our final cut ( on both selection criteria a & b ) the requirement that the blended microlensing fit be preferred over the sn type ia fit , or @xmath83 .",
    "this eliminates events  10 and 12 from set a and events  10 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 24 , and 26 from set b. event 22 , clearly not a type ia , is a special case and will be discussed later .",
    "the advantage of using this simple cut is that we may quantify the effect it has on the detection efficiency ( see   [ sec - eff ] ) .",
    "the effect is negligible since less then 0.7% of artificial standard microlensing events are falsely rejected by this cut .",
    "there are several important caveats to using the sn ia fits to reject potential sn interlopers .",
    "first , both microlensing and sn come in a variety of flavors .",
    "although type ia have well defined lightcurves , other types of sn are not so well behaved ( types ib , ic , iip , iil , etc . ) and can come in a variety of durations and asymmetries .",
    "we note here that two of our sn interlopers ( events  11 and 24 ) are likely to be sn type iip as judged by the plateau seen in both passbands about 25 - 50 days after maximum ( never seen in both passbands for type ia )",
    ". however , even these lightcurves are usually better fit by sn type ia than blended microlensing , mostly due to the asymmetry that sn lightcurves typically exhibit .",
    "second , exotic microlensing such as found in binary lenses or parallax events , could mimic the asymmetry of type ia sn .",
    "there are several reasons why we believe that this is not a major problem : 1 ) event 9 , a binary lens event , is better fit by a single lens microlensing lightcurve than a sn ia lightcurve , 2 ) out of many microlensing events towards the galactic bulge less than 10% are of clearly exotic type @xcite , 3 ) exotic microlensing should show the `` wrong '' sign of asymmetry 50% of the time , and we have no examples of this among our events .",
    "however , two events do stand out as potentially worrisome .",
    "event 26 is better fit by sn type ia , but does not show a clear background galaxy in our deepest ctio 0.9 m images .",
    "it could be an example of exotic lensing . for purposes of this paper",
    ", we reject this as a potential sn interloper , but must await a better image before making any definitive conclusions on this event .",
    "event  22 is our longest duration event and is clearly asymmetric to the eye .",
    "however , even with the clear asymmetry this event is better fit with blended microlensing than with a sn type ia , mainly because type ia s are not observed to last this long .",
    "the asymmetry of this event is well fit by microlensing parallax , which would be a natural explanation given the very long duration of this event .",
    "there is also no strong evidence of a galaxy in ground - based images , though the object is slightly extended .",
    "microlensing parallax is a good explanation for this event , and if this interpretation is correct , it appears that the lens is probably a white dwarf in a flattened halo or thick disk population.@xcite on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that event  22 belongs to a class of sn (  slow \" type iin ) similar to sn 1988z @xcite . therefore , in the spirit of our selection criteria , we reject event 22 from the exclusive set a and keep it in the inclusive set b. since event  22 is our longest duration event and therefore contributes maximally to the optical depth , this is also the conservative approach to exploring the sensitivity of our results to the selection criteria .      here",
    "we briefly summarize the events that will constitute set a & set b. the main results of this paper rest upon these two sets of candidate microlensing events .",
    "criteria a selected 19 lightcurves corresponding to 16 unique events ( events  1 , 10 , & 12 in field overlaps ) . of these 16 unique events two",
    "( events  10 & 12 ) are rejected as sn interlopers due to the final sn cut @xmath83 and an unexplained event  22 is rejected in the spirit of criteria a being exclusive .",
    "this leaves set a containing 13 events :  1 , 4 - 8 , 13 - 15 , 18 , 21 , 23 , & 25 .",
    "criteria b selected 29 lightcurves corresponding to 25 unique events ( events  1 , 10 , & 12 in field overlaps and event  7 duplicated via contamination ) . of these 25 unique events 8 ( events  10 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 24 , & 26 ) are rejected as sn interlopers . here",
    ", we do not reject event  22 but leave it in the set as a potential exotic lensing event . as a result , set",
    "b contains 17 events :  1 , 4 - 9 , 13 - 15 , 18 , 20 - 23 , 25 , & 27 .",
    "the detection probability for individual events depends on many factors , e.g. the 3 event parameters @xmath64 , @xmath1 , @xmath30 , and the unlensed stellar magnitude , as well as our observing strategy and weather conditions .",
    "such a complicated dependence is most naturally found with a monte carlo technique .",
    "we may simplify the dependence to some extent by averaging over the known distributions in @xmath64 , @xmath30 , the stellar magnitudes , and the known time - sampling and weather conditions , to derive our efficiency as a function only of event timescale , @xmath84 .",
    "we have computed our detection efficiency using a method similar to that outlined in , but with a number of improvements . a full discussion of the method , with detailed results , is given in alcock  ( 2000a ) and vandehei ( 2000 ) .",
    "briefly , we generate simulated microlensing events with @xmath1 logarithmically distributed in the range 12000 days over the slightly wider time interval , @xmath85 to 2277.0 , and add these simulated events into the extended time span of observations .",
    "a large database of artificial star tests is used to simulate the effects of blending .",
    "a number of systematic photometric effects , including the response of flux , error bars , and the photometric flags outlined in   [ sec - obs ] are also included .",
    "the monte - carlo procedure takes into account the actual spacing and error bars of the observations , so any variations in sampling frequency , weather , seeing , etc .  between the  data set and the current data set",
    "are automatically accounted for .",
    "one of the primary shortcomings of the efficiency analysis presented in   was a lack of faint ` stars ' in the artificial star tests , which are used to add simulated events . in the current analysis ,",
    "a large number of faint stars down to @xmath86 are used .",
    "this is 2.5 magnitudes fainter than in .",
    "it is also 2.5 magnitudes fainter than our faintest detected objects .",
    "the present analysis also makes use of a much larger database of artificial stars ( @xmath87 ) sampled over a larger ( @xmath88 ) and more fairly distributed set of observing conditions ( stellar density , seeing , & sky ) .",
    "another major improvement , not fully recognized as a major source of uncertainty in , is a normalization of our fields to the underlying luminosity function .",
    "a main issue in efficiency determination is the distinction between  objects \" and stars .",
    "objects are flux concentrations identified by the photometry code as stellar - like objects .",
    "each object is typically a blend of many underlying lmc stars , any one of which can undergo microlensing , and it is important to identify the correct density of underlying lmc stars in each of our fields .",
    "the present efficiency is based on all stars in our fields , even those not uniquely identified because of signal - to - noise or crowding effects .",
    "these are accounted for by integrating the detection efficiency per star over the true underlying luminosity function ( lf ) in the lmc .",
    "our lf in the lmc is derived from a combination of ground - based macho photometry ( for stars with @xmath89 ) and multiple hst wfpc2 fields in the lmc bar ( for stars with @xmath90 ) and is described in alcock  ( 2000a ) and alcock  ( 1999c ) .",
    "the shape of the lf appears universal in most of our fields and is well constrained for @xmath91 .",
    "but , any reasonable deviation from the adopted shape down to @xmath92 has little effect on our efficiency @xcite .",
    "an important and yet uncertain factor is the normalization of the lf in each of our fields , which determines our effective sensitivity or exposure in star - years . because our exposure in _ object - years _ is well known and the efficiency should converge at some magnitude ( as fainter stars contribute less and less ) we have chosen to factor this normalization into the efficiency .",
    "thus our efficiency is properly defined as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the efficiency per star to @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the normalization , or the number of stars per object ( defined as the ratio of the true number of stars with @xmath97 to the number of sodophot objects ) .",
    "the value of @xmath96 is @xmath98 stars per object and represents a weighted average over all 30 fields .",
    "the limiting magnitude @xmath99 was chosen because the efficiency for durations @xmath100days converges .",
    "the efficiency for longer durations does not converge by @xmath99 , and thus these are likely underestimated , with the underestimation becoming worse for longer duration events .",
    "the exact point and speed of convergence is sensitive to the assumed shape of the lf and the cuts used , with criteria a converging more rapidly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since none of our 13 - 17  events have durations longer than 300 days our efficiency determination for them is sound .",
    "the uncertainty in the efficiency is dominated by the uncertainty in the normalization , which we estimate to be @xmath101 ( see @xcite for a more detailed error budget ) .",
    "efficiency results are shown in figure  [ fig - eff ] .",
    "selection criteria a is shown as a _ solid _ line and criteria b as a _ dotted _ line .",
    "also shown for comparison are the efficiencies presented in  ( _ long dash _ ) and  ( _ short dash _ ) .",
    "note that the efficiencies presented here have been scaled by a normalization term that accounts for the increased exposure due to all stars in our fields , down to @xmath99 ( as described above ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the efficiency defined in this manner is not constrained to lie below one , though in practice it always does .",
    "this efficiency is defined relative to an ` exposure ' of @xmath102 object - years , which arises as follows : there are 11.9 million lightcurves in our total sample , and 20% occur in field overlaps .",
    "the relevant time span is the 2087-day interval over which we add the simulated events ; thus the exposure is @xmath103 objects @xmath104 object - years .",
    "this exposure is 3.4 times larger than in .",
    "note that number of stars in field overlaps has increased from 12% in , due to additional fields and a more careful calculation of the field overlap size .",
    "the most striking difference between the previous two data sets (  & ) and the current set is the much higher efficiency at long durations .",
    "most of this difference is a reflection of having 5.7 years of data instead of 2.1 years .",
    "explicit cuts in a97 were made that removed any events with @xmath105 days , while the current cuts both use @xmath106 days .",
    "we also made a slight modification to our observing strategy intended to increase our sensitivity to long duration events .",
    "however , some of the difference also lies in a quirk of the year 2 data set . in a97",
    ", six of the densest fields had their lightcurves cut in half , roughly , due to an early generation of templates used to reduce the photometry for these fields .",
    "as described in   [ sec - obs ] the photometry for these six fields has been re - run with the new generation of templates and the lightcurves merged onto a common photometric system .",
    "the effect of this was a lowered efficiency in  for events with durations longer than @xmath107days ( mainly due to the required 40 baseline points in the ` halved ' lightcurves ) .",
    "the problem did not exist in the year 1 data , thus the rather similar behavior of year 1 and year 2 at large @xmath1 , even though the later had twice the coverage .",
    "the relative looseness of selection criteria b over criteria a discussed in   [ sec - cuts ] ( i.e. 17 vs. 13 events ) is well illustrated in figure  [ fig - eff ] . only for short durations , @xmath108days , is criteria a more efficient , due to criteria b s larger number of required high points ( @xmath109 ) as compared with criteria a ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "less than half of the difference in efficiency between criteria a & b is explained by the different @xmath64 cuts ; given @xmath64 cuts of 1.49 & 1.34 for criteria a & b respectively , we naively expect criteria b to recover 17% more events .",
    "in fact , only event  27 ( 7% ) would have been missed had criteria b s @xmath64 cut been increased to 1.49 .",
    "the remainder of the difference lies primarily in the effect of two cuts .",
    "many of the events that failed criteria a did so because they failed either the cut in @xmath65 or the cut in @xmath53 . both of these cuts have been tightened from their year 2 values . from our monte carlo events",
    "we find that tightening these two cuts has the following two effects : ( 1 ) lessens our sensitivity to moderately or strongly blended events , and ( 2 ) tightening the @xmath65 cut also decreases sensitivity to exotic microlensing and other asymmetric lightcurves , such as supernovae .",
    "for example , the slightly asymmetric event  26 did not pass criteria a because of the cut @xmath62 . as a result , set a has fewer events removed by the supernova cut .    in alcock ( 2000a )",
    "we describe in detail a robust way of statistically correcting for the @xmath1 bias induced by blending .",
    "briefly , this method is an integration over the lf of the median @xmath1 bias induced by blending in our sample of monte carlo events . as a check that this method gives a truly unbiased optical depth estimate we ran a series of secondary monte carlo simulations that make use of this correction and a number of galactic halo models . the statistical correction ,",
    "although it blurs the individual events together , does a satisfactory job of reproducing an unbiased optical depth .",
    "the primary shortcoming of the present efficiency analysis is that all simulated events are assumed to be  normal \" microlensing events with a single lens , a point source , and constant velocities .",
    "this assumption is used in the present analysis for simplicity and because of the highly uncertain characterization of exotic lensing events .",
    "a careful study using selection criteria much looser than criteria a & b has convinced us that it is unlikely that we have missed any exotic lensing events in the present data set . the primary concern is what effect the addition of exotic lensing might have on our detection efficiency ( in particular because of binary lensing events ) . although this is as yet uncertain it is probably a small effect due to the small number of exotic lensing events seen so far and the fact that criteria b does find some exotic lensing events .",
    "there are a number of statistical tests that can be performed on microlensing event distributions to test the hypothesis that events are gravitational microlensing , or to test hypotheses regarding the lens population .",
    "as the sample of events becomes larger these tests become important discrimination tools .",
    "an important model - independent test of the hypothesis that we have observed gravitational microlensing is to compare the distribution of peak magnifications to the theoretical prediction .",
    "it is convenient to switch variables from the maximum magnification ( @xmath111 ) to the minimum distance of approach between the macho and the line of sight , in units of the einstein radius , @xmath112 .",
    "events should be uniformly distributed in @xmath28 ; this distribution is then modified by the experimental detection probability which is typically higher for small @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the observed and predicted distributions for our lmc events for both selection criteria are shown in figure  [ fig - umin ] .",
    "a k - s test shows a probability of @xmath113 of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value 0.172 for criteria a by chance , and a probability of @xmath114 of being worse than 0.202 for criteria b. the binary event  9 is excluded from this comparison .",
    "we conclude that the distribution of events in @xmath28 is consistent with the microlensing interpretation .",
    "the @xmath28 distribution and the high magnification events may be used to lend support to the microlensing interpretation of our lower magnification events .",
    "our high magnification events are striking , and are clearly separated from the background in figure  [ fig - cuts ] . if these high magnification events are accepted as microlensing then there must exist many more microlensing events with smaller peak magnification .",
    "figure  [ fig - umin ] shows that we find these in just the right proportion .",
    "the gravitational microlens does not distinguish between types of stars , so naively one expects microlensing to occur uniformly on every type of source star .",
    "however , both selection criteria a & b employ various signal - to - noise cuts that bias us against detecting microlensing events on faint stars .",
    "in addition , the measured baseline flux of an event may be significantly larger because of the blending of non - lensed flux , and it is not always possible to accurately determine the amount of blending .",
    "that is , the blending fits in table  [ tab - blend ] may not be reliable , since there is considerable fit parameter degeneracy between @xmath111 and the blend fraction .",
    "thus , detected microlensing candidates , while occurring on many types of source stars , may not follow the observed distribution of stars ( or rather objects ) exactly .",
    "figure  [ fig - cmd ] shows a cmd with each of the 17 microlensing candidates , along with all the closest 200 stars around each candidate .",
    "most of the events lie along the faint main sequence where most of the observed lmc stars reside .",
    "event  5 is quite red for its brightness and could represent a foreground population of bright m  dwarf lenses as noted in , but as a whole the distribution in the cmd is quite representative . the distribution of events is not clustered in luminosity or the color magnitude diagram and is consistent with the microlensing interpretation .      for microlensing by machos smoothly distributed in the galactic halo , or stellar lensing by stars in the milky way thin or thick disk ,",
    "we expect the detected events to be distributed across our fields in proportion to the local exposure",
    ". an extended lmc halo population could also form a smooth distribution .",
    "in contrast , models in which lmc disk and bar stars dominate the lensing population predict that the lensing events will be concentrated within the lmc ( @xcite , but also see alves & nelson 1999 where a flared disk could widen this distribution to some extent ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - lmc ] indicates that the detected events are apparently spread evenly across our 30 fields . to quantify this impression we perform two simple tests . for criteria a & b we computed a concentration parameter , @xmath115 , as described in gyuk  ( 1999 ) .",
    "this parameter is a mean spatial separation between all combinations of events . for our two selection criteria",
    "we find @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where the error bars have been estimated using the observed number of events and the models of gyuk ( 1999 ) ( private communication ) .",
    "these numbers should be compared with predictions from the various models of lmc self  lensing .",
    "gyuk  ( 1999 ) find @xmath118 over the macho 30 fields for all their lmc disk+bar self  lensing models , and @xmath119 for lmc disk+bar+halo and galactic halo models .",
    "thus by this measure our event distribution is inconsistent with their most favored lmc disk+bar self  lensing at the @xmath120 level , but is consistent with an extended lens population such as is expected for a galactic or lmc halo population .",
    "our second test is illustrated in figure  [ fig - lmc_space ] where the cumulative distribution in spatial distances on the sky , as measured from the optical center of the bar ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , is plotted .",
    "also shown are two predictions based on the models of gyuk ,  ( 1999 ) : the dashed line is the predicted distribution for uniform lensing ( lmc disk+bar+halo ) over the face of the lmc , convolved with our detection efficiency per field @xcite , and the dotted line is the favored lmc disk+bar self  lensing model , also convolved with our detection efficiency per field . for criteria a , a k - s test yields a probability of @xmath123 of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value 0.342 for the disk+bar model . for the disk+bar+halo model",
    "there is a probability of @xmath124 of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value 0.204 . for criteria",
    "b , a k - s test yields a probability of @xmath125 of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value 0.349 for the disk+bar model and for the disk+bar+halo model there is a probability of @xmath126 of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value 0.220 .",
    "we note that these results are dependent on a direct comparison to the 30 fields used in this analysis , and that the lmc disk+bar self  lensing predictions are inconsistent with the data at the 93% c.l .",
    "one difference between a relatively smooth distribution of events over the face of the lmc caused by a galactic population and that caused by a lmc halo is a slight east - west asymmetry due to the @xmath127 tilt of lmc s disk .",
    "this tilt would induce a slightly higher optical depth on the western side of the lmc , due to the longer path length through any lmc halo .",
    "no such east - west asymmetry should exist if the microlenses are due to a galactic population . a casual inspection of figure  [ fig - lmc ] hints at the possibility of such an east - west asymmetry .",
    "however , a simple monte carlo shows that the asymmetry is not statistically significant given the number of events in our sample .",
    "we start with the implied microlensing optical depth , which is compared with the optical depth expected from known populations of stars along the line of sight to the lmc .",
    "we then discuss our likelihood estimate of microlensing rate , macho masses , and optical depth for both the dark halo and known stellar populations .",
    "the simplest measurable quantity in a gravitational microlensing experiment is the microlensing optical depth , @xmath128 , which is defined to be the instantaneous probability that a random star is magnified by a lens by more than a factor of 1.34 .",
    "this probability depends only on the density profile of lenses , not on their masses or velocities .",
    "experimentally , one can obtain an estimate of the optical depth as    @xmath129    where @xmath130",
    "object - years is the total exposure , @xmath131 is the einstein ring diameter crossing time of the @xmath132th event , and @xmath133 is its detection efficiency . here , and below , we use the statistically corrected values of the blended durations @xmath134 ( table  [ tab - blthat ] ) .",
    "these take into account the fact that our typical star is blended , and so the fit @xmath1 is typically underestimated .",
    "this statistical correction depends upon the selection criteria used and is described more fully in   [ sec - eff ] .",
    "it is also convenient to define the function    @xmath135    which is the contribution to @xmath136 from a single observed event with timescale @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath137 values for each of our events are also listed in table  [ tab - blthat ] for both selection criteria .    using the criteria a set of 13 events , we find ( tables [ tab - tau ] and [ tab - taucl ] ) an optical depth for events with durations @xmath138 days @xmath139 days of @xmath140 . with the criteria",
    "b set of 17 events , we find @xmath141 .",
    "this is to be compared with @xmath142 for a typical dark halo consisting entirely of machos and with predicted @xmath143 to @xmath144 from known stellar populations ( from table  [ tab - stars ] below ) . subtracting the stellar lensing background from our observed optical depth",
    ", we find that the observed excess is about 15%-25% of the predicted microlensing optical depth for a typical all - macho halo of equation  ( [ eq - stdhalo ] ) below .",
    "this optical depth estimate has the virtue of simplicity ; however , since the events are `` weighted '' @xmath145 , it is hard to assign meaningful confidence intervals to @xmath128 without assuming some particular @xmath1 distribution .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig - tau ] , which shows the contribution to the sum in equation  ( [ eq - taumeas ] ) from events in various bins of @xmath1 . in comparison with a97",
    ", we note that while the contributions become large at large @xmath1 , they are substantially smaller in the 100 - 300 day range due to the increased baseline and looser cut @xmath146 days . the large contribution at long @xmath1 implies that the overall uncertainty in @xmath128 is greater than simple poisson statistics based on 13 or 17 events",
    ". however , this uncertainty will continue to decrease as the experiment progresses .",
    "for example , in a97 we estimated that should we expect to have observed on average 1 additional event with @xmath147 days ( but happened to observe no such event ) , the real @xmath128 would have been a factor of two higher , and we were not able to exclude such a possibility with any confidence .",
    "the equivalent situation with the current data set is less dangerous , as such a missed event would result in a real @xmath128 being only about 20% higher .",
    "however , our optical depth estimate is valid only for a specific mass or timescale interval .",
    "the likelihood method of   [ sec - likely ] gives another way of estimating the optical depth and the errors on the optical depth .",
    "figures  [ fig - tau - vs - umin ] and [ fig - tau - vs - delc2 ] show the dependence of the the measured optical depth on the @xmath148 and @xmath149 cuts .",
    "the heavy curves indicate @xmath136 for set a while the light curves give @xmath136 for set b. for the binary event we have assigned a @xmath148 value of 0.573 , which is the value obtained for the single - lens fit .",
    "figures  [ fig - tau - vs - umin ] and [ fig - tau - vs - delc2 ] clearly indicate that our optical depth results are not very sensitive to our cut values .",
    "the @xmath136 values generally do not vary by more then the @xmath150 statistical error bars for @xmath148 and @xmath149 cuts in the ranges @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we note the largest single contribution is from event 22 , which was included in set b and excluded in set a.      why is our new value of the optical depth a factor of two smaller than the value reported in ?",
    "the reasons are manyfold and somewhat difficult to separate out completely . by far the largest effect",
    "can be classified as poisson in nature .",
    "we list the causes in order of decreasing effect on the optical depth .    inspection of figure  [ fig - events ] reveals that a disproportionate number of our ` high ' quality events were observed in the first 2.1 years of the data set .",
    "events  1 , 5 , 7 , and 9 are all of high quality .",
    "only event  14 , 21 , 23 , in the following 3.6 years stand out as having comparable quality .",
    "this ` qualitative ' feel for the events is backed - up by the fact that in the first 2.1 years , 6 - 7 events were observed : a rate of 2.9 - 3.3 events / year . and for the last 3.6 years only 7 - 10 events were observed : a rate of 1.9 - 2.8 events / year .",
    "since the efficiency has not changed drastically over this interval , we conclude that while the exposure increased by a factor of 3.4 , the number of events did not .",
    "that is , we got ",
    "lucky \" during the 2.1 years of  and detected more microlensing than average .",
    "this possibility was reflected in the large poisson errors quoted in a97 .",
    "another reason the optical depth reported in  is large compared to this work is related to the splitting of the top 6 fields for analysis described in   [ sec - obs ] .",
    "these 6 fields represented @xmath153 of our exposure in object - years . because they were split into two sets of lightcurves of approximately one year duration the efficiency was lowered for durations @xmath154 days .",
    "at least 4 of the events in the 8 event sample of  ( events  5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ) contributed somewhat more to the optical depth then they would have had the top 6 fields not been split for analysis .",
    "this in itself was not in error , for one would have expected that one or two events would have been missed because of the splitting of the top 6 fields and these ` missed ' events would have counter - balanced the decreased efficiency . by chance ,",
    "no such events were missed , as is evident in the current analysis where the top 6 fields have been merged and analyzed as full lightcurves .",
    "we estimate that this  small numbers \" ( poisson ) effect increased the optical depth reported in  by @xmath155 .    for reasons discussed in more detail in   [ sec - eff ] ( and alcock , 2000a ) ,",
    "our detection efficiency is somewhat higher than in .",
    "briefly , we neglected a contribution from faint stars with @xmath156 and thus our efficiency in  had not yet converged for durations @xmath154 days . in addition , our new normalization , which has been more carefully determined using hst data , and has more realistically estimated errors leads to a somewhat increased sensitivity .",
    "together , these effects spuriously increased the optical depth in by @xmath157 with respect to the current results .",
    "this is within our estimated uncertainty .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec - sn ] , one of the events used in  ( event  10 ) is most likely a sn interloper .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the presence of an obvious spiral galaxy in our hst frames of this event and the fact that it is quite reasonably fit by a type ia sn lightcurve .",
    "the effect of this interloper spuriously increased the optical depth by @xmath158 in the 8 event sample and had no effect on the 6 event sample ( which rejected it ) .",
    "while the current analysis is the most careful yet performed and a substantial improvement over earlier efforts , there are still a number of errors or potential errors that exist in our results .",
    "the errors due to small number statistics are included in the error bars we report ( about 30% uncertainty ) .",
    "the errors due to model dependency are explored by considering a range of models .",
    "we believe these are the largest errors in our results . in this short section and",
    "in table  [ tab - tauerrorbudget ] we list some other sources of error that might be worth considering in more detail in the future .    _ normalization of star to object ratio : _ the ratio of actual lmc stars to sodophot objects varies across our fields , and it is very difficult to accurately estimate .",
    "we have hst images for three areas , and attempt to tie together macho object based photometry to the hst star - based photometry to create a unified luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "we estimate a 20% uncertainty in our final results because of this .",
    "issues include the underlying luminosity function , the magnitude calibration of our objects , blending effects in matching the object lf to the stellar lf , and the unknown effects of crowding , seeing , and sky in the template images , among several others .    _",
    "selection criteria : _ since we do not have a complete understanding of the background , and because we examine our data before deciding upon the selection criteria , it is possible that we differentiate background and microlensing in an imperfect and/or biased way .",
    "we implemented two independent sets of selection criteria as a test of our sensitivity to this bias .",
    "we estimate about a 20% uncertainty due to our selection criteria .",
    "_ correction to @xmath1 : _ blending causes the durations of events to shift from their naive fit values .",
    "we chose to correct for this in a statistical manner , and estimate about a 3% uncertainty in this correction .",
    "this is due to several factors , but mainly the uncertainty in the true @xmath1 distribution which is needed to make the correction .",
    "_ binary source stars : _ locally most stars reside in binary or multiple star systems , and it is expected that this is also true of lmc stars .",
    "our lmc luminosity function does not include a correction for this .",
    "this is a complicated correction which will be uncertain since the binary fraction for lmc stars is not known .",
    "we did not make an estimate of the size of this effect , but will consider it in a later paper .",
    "_ exotic microlensing : _ we do not explicitly add binary - lens microlensing or other exotic lensing into our artifical lightcurves . thus our efficiencies for these are unknown . we did try to explore two sets of selection criteria to detect any gross sensitivity of our results to this effect , but a proper calculation should be done in the future .    _",
    "others : _ there are several other sources of systematic error that have been considered . for example , in the artifical star monte carlo we assume that all flux added goes to the nearest sodophot object .",
    "direct tests show that this is not true in about 3% of the cases .",
    "the effect of this mis - identification is not known , but could be around 3% .",
    "some other small errors are discussed in alcock ,  ( 2000a ) and vandehei ( 2000 ) , and a summary is given in table  [ tab - tauerrorbudget ] .",
    "finally we note that due to the complex nature of systematic errors , it is not straightforward to combine them with each other or with statistical errors .",
    "for example , systematic errors can be strongly asymmetric .",
    "we estimate our total systematic error to be in the range of 20% -30% , though even this range is uncertain .",
    "we compare the number of detected events and the distribution of observed timescales , @xmath1 , with predictions from models of various lens populations .",
    "microlensing can occur when any compact object travels in front of a monitored star , so we expect microlensing events from any population of stars , remnants , or dark compact objects that lie between us and the lmc .",
    "luckily , much is known about the density and velocity distribution of stars and remnants in the milky way and lmc .",
    "less is known about the dark halo of the milky way ( and even less about the dark halo of the lmc ) , but we can leave the fraction , @xmath159 , of dark objects that can lens , as well as the masses , @xmath160 of these objects , as free parameters which we determine using a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "this analysis was done in a97 , with 6 or 8 observed microlensing events .",
    "we found values of @xmath159 between 0.15 and 1.0 at 90% confidence level ( cl ) , and macho masses @xmath160 between 0.1 and 1.0 @xmath14 .",
    "the large uncertainty in these results came largely from small number statistics , but also from uncertainty in the models . in the current analysis",
    ", we have a larger number of events and an improved efficiency determination , so we can reduce the poisson and some systematic errors . here",
    "we also make improvements to our likelihood analysis , most notably the inclusion of realistic estimates of the stellar lensing background within the likelihood function .",
    "we note that the results of this section still depend heavily upon the models of milky way and lmc .",
    "we will come back to this point in   [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "the microlensing event rate @xmath161 is more model - dependent than the optical depth @xmath128 .",
    "rate @xmath161 depends on the event timescales via the mass function of machos and their velocity distribution , but the uncertainties in @xmath161 are given purely by poisson statistics .",
    "thus @xmath161 is useful in quantifying the errors on any measurement , once a halo model is specified .",
    "the number of observed events is given by a poisson distribution with a mean of    @xmath162    where @xmath163 object - years is our total ` exposure ' , and @xmath164 is the total differential microlensing rate , @xmath165 for a typical dark matter halo ( equation  [ eq - stdhalo ] ) consisting of 100% machos , the total rate of microlensing events with @xmath166 is given by equation  ( a2 ) of : @xmath167 events / star / yr .",
    "thus if all machos had the same mass and our efficiency were 100% , we would expect about @xmath168 events in the present data set .",
    "the average timescale of an event scales oppositely , @xmath169 , since the product of the two gives the optical depth which is independent of the macho masses , @xmath170 .",
    "thus , although the optical depth is independent of macho mass , in a real microlensing experiment statements on the macho content of the halo will be dependent on the macho mass .",
    "however , the masses of the lenses are constrained , since we measure the distribution of event timescales .",
    "we consider four stellar components and a dark component of the milky way , and a stellar and dark component of the lmc . given our exposure and efficiency , and a model of the density , velocity distribution , and mass function of a lens population , we can calculate the expected microlensing optical depth , microlensing rate , distribution of event durations , and the number of expected events detected in our experiment .",
    "a summary of the results are shown in tables  [ tab - stars ] and [ tab - like ] .",
    "for the lmc self - lensing model , we note that the rate depends strongly on the position on the sky , so the values we report depend on the 30 specific fields we monitor .",
    "we model the density of the milky way and lmc thin and thick disks as double exponentials @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath174 is the total mass of the disk , @xmath175 is the scale height , and @xmath176 is the scale length . instead of specifying the total mass , milky way disks are often specified by the column density , @xmath177 , at the solar circle , @xmath178 kpc , and the relation is @xmath179 for simplicity , we characterize the velocity distribution of a disk as a constant rotation velocity , @xmath180 , with some isotropic dispersion , @xmath181 , in addition .    for the normal milky way thin disk we use parameters : @xmath182 kpc , @xmath183 kpc , @xmath184 , @xmath185 kpc , @xmath186 km / s , and @xmath187 km / s .",
    "this gives a total thin disk mass of @xmath188 later , we will discuss models ( e.g. , model f ) with a maximal thin disk , and a smaller dark halo . in that case",
    "we use the above parameters except with @xmath189 , which gives @xmath190    for the milky way thick disk we use parameters : @xmath182 kpc , @xmath191 kpc , @xmath192 , @xmath185 kpc , @xmath186 km / s , and @xmath193 km / s , for a total mass of @xmath194 .    for the lmc disk we use the preferred parameters from gyuk  ( 1999 ) , @xmath195 kpc , @xmath183 kpc , @xmath196 km / s , @xmath197 km / s , and @xmath198 .",
    "the lmc disk self - lensing also depends upon its distance , @xmath199 kpc , inclination , @xmath200 , and position angle , @xmath201 .",
    "these are the parameters we use when considering the lmc disk plus lmc dark halo model . for the pure disk ( no lmc halo ) case , we conservatively increase @xmath174 to @xmath202 , in good agreement with recent analysis of the lmc rotation curve ( @xmath203 @xcite , corresponding to central surface densities of 190 @xmath204 and 320 @xmath204 respectively .",
    "we do not consider a separate bar component , since the bar mass is strongly limited by the hi kinematics @xcite .",
    "the milky way spheroid density is modeled as @xcite @xmath205 with no rotation , and an isotropic velocity dispersion of @xmath206 km / s .    for the lmc we consider two main cases : 1 ) pure disk / disk self - lensing , and 2 ) disk / disk self - lensing plus an lmc dark halo consisting of fraction @xmath159 of machos , with @xmath159 being the same fraction used for the milky way dark halo .",
    "later , we also consider the possibility of an all stellar lmc halo .",
    "for the milky way dark halo we consider three models : s , b , f , which were used in a96 and a97 .",
    "the density of model s is given by    @xmath207    where @xmath208 is the halo density , @xmath209 is the local dark matter density , @xmath210 is galactocentric radius , @xmath211 is the galactocentric radius of the sun , and @xmath212 kpc is the halo core radius . with the standard thin disk , this model has a total rotation speed at 50 kpc of 200 km / s , with 190 km / s coming from the halo .",
    "we assume an isotropic maxwellian distribution of velocities with a 1-d rms velocity of @xmath213 , and assume a @xmath77-function macho mass function of arbitrary mass @xmath160 .",
    "note that we always multiply the above density by the macho halo fraction @xmath159 , implicitly assuming that the remaining @xmath214 fraction of the halo is filled with some exotic particle dark matter or other non - lensing matter .",
    "dark halo models b and f are power - law models @xcite , and are discussed in detail in a96 , and a97 .",
    "model b has a very large dark halo and a standard thin disk , giving a rising rotation curve that reaches 258 km / s at 50 kpc .",
    "model f has an extremely low mass halo , somewhat inconsistent with the known galactic rotation curve , and a very massive disk . at 50 kpc",
    ", the model f halo contributes 134 km / s towards a total of 160 km / s rotation speed .",
    "finally , for the lmc halo we follow gyuk  ( 1999 ) and use the same density distribution as model s above , but with a central density of @xmath215 , @xmath216 kpc , @xmath217 km / s , and a tidal truncation radius at 11 kpc . in this model",
    "the mass of the lmc halo in the inner 8 kpc is @xmath218 and the total mass of the halo is @xmath219 .",
    "this is a somewhat extreme model , probably larger than allowed by the lmc rotation curve . like the milky way halo",
    ", the lmc halo is assumed to consist of a fraction @xmath159 of machos all of mass @xmath160 .",
    "it is conceivable that the lmc macho halo fraction and make - up is different than the macho fraction in the milky way halo , and we consider this possibility in the next section .",
    "we note that no substantial stellar component of an lmc halo has yet been observed .    for the stellar lensing populations we integrate the microlensing rate over a mass function .",
    "there have been several recent determinations of the present day mass function ( pdmf ) , but it is not clear that the mass function determined locally is valid for all the stellar populations we model .",
    "however , for simplicity we will use the pdmf of gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1997 ) for all the stellar populations . table  [ tab - stars ] shows some properties of the stellar population calculated from the models above .",
    "it also shows the expected number of microlensing events from each population found by the likelihood method , and thus including the effect of our efficiency calculation and selection criteria .",
    "these results differ to some degree from those presented in a97 for several reasons .",
    "first , the models we use are different in some cases , and we are using a different pdmf .",
    "second , and most importantly , we explicitly do not count lenses that are too bright to be detected as microlensing in our experiment .",
    "we have an explicit cut at around @xmath220 magnitudes , and so stars brighter than this can not be found as lenses .",
    "our monte carlo shows that this cuts the expected number of thin disk stellar lensing events by more than half , with smaller effects for thick disk , spheroid , etc . and almost no effect for lmc disk lensing .",
    "the results displayed in table  [ tab - stars ] , use the full monte carlo for all stellar distributions .",
    "we find the most likely values of halo fraction @xmath159 and unique macho mass @xmath160 using our set a ( 13 events ) and set b ( 17 events ) , and their corresponding efficiencies .",
    "the likelihood function is    @xmath221    where , @xmath222 and each @xmath223 is the theoretical rate of microlensing derived from model @xmath224 .",
    "the distributions @xmath225 for stellar populations are integrated over a mass function @xcite as described above , and are calculated using code described in gyuk  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the results are dependent on the model so we explore a range of possible halos , including a standard halo ( model s from a96 and a97 ) .",
    "we also use two other dark halo models .",
    "we choose model b from a96 and a97 , because it is about as large a halo as the data will allow .",
    "we also choose model f from a96 and a97 because it has a nearly maximal disk and a very low mass halo , and therefore is as small a halo as the data allows .",
    "these models are described in detail in a96 .",
    "we do not show models a , c , d , or g from a96 and a97 , or other possible halo models since they are in general intermediate between the extremes of models b and f. model s is a common pseudo - isothermal sphere @xcite with an asymptotic rotation velocity of 220 km / s , while models b and f are power - law evans models @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab - like ] shows the results for all the models , and figures  [ fig - like - cow ] , [ fig - like - b ] , and [ fig - like - f ] show the corresponding likelihood contours .    for model",
    "s , the resulting likelihood contours , assuming a @xmath77-function halo mass function , are shown in figure  [ fig - like - cow ] .",
    "the probabilities are computed using a bayesian method with a prior uniform in @xmath159 and @xmath226 .",
    "we show likelihood contours for both our 13 event sample and our 17 event sample , and with and without the lmc halo .",
    "the best fit values and errors are given in table  [ tab - like ] .",
    "the errors shown in the table are one - sigma errors .",
    "the peak of the likelihood contours gives the most probable mass and halo fraction for a given model and for set a with an lmc halo we find @xmath227 , @xmath228 .",
    "for the corresponding set b , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 .",
    "we calculate the one - dimensional likelihood function by integrating over the other parameter and find ( for set a without an lmc dark halo ) a most likely macho mass @xmath231 , and most likely halo fraction @xmath232 .",
    "the errors given are 68% cl .",
    "the values for set b are @xmath233 and @xmath234 . for model",
    "s , the 95% cl contour includes halo fractions from about 8% to about 50% , and machos masses from about 0.12 @xmath14 to 1.1 @xmath14 , depending upon the selection criteria and lmc model used .",
    "the likelihood method gives an optical depth for the halo population of @xmath235 almost independent of the section criteria , the lmc model , and the galactic model .",
    "there are several important comments to be made .",
    "first , sets a and b give results that are remarkably similar , implying that the systematic error introduced by our selection criteria methodology is small .",
    "the important parameters of estimated macho halo fraction are nearly identical using the two different sets of events and efficiency determinations .",
    "the estimated typical macho mass does vary between the two sets of events , but the values lie within one sigma of each other .",
    "this difference in lens mass comes partially from the rejection of event 22 from set a.    second , consistent with our optical depth estimates , the values of the halo fraction are approximately a factor of two lower than we found in a97 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec - why ] , this is mainly a result of finding more events per unit exposure during the first two years , but is also due to changes in efficiency , etc .",
    "we note that the optical depths reported in table  [ tab - like ] are the estimated macho contribution , and do not include the background of stellar microlensing .",
    "the contributions from stellar background are shown in table  [ tab - stars ] .",
    "the values found here are quite similar to those found directly in   [ sec - tau ] .",
    "third , our new confidence intervals are substantially smaller than those of a97 due to the larger number of events .",
    "even though the central values have changed , there is reasonable overlap of our new contours with the a97 contours , and our new most likely values lie within the a97 90% confidence region .",
    "next , for model s with a large lmc disk , but no lmc dark halo , and set a , we expect a total of 3.0 events from stellar background sources , with the majority coming from lmc self - lensing .",
    "for the same model and set b , the number of expected background events is 3.9 . in both cases",
    "the predicted number of background events is substantially below the number of detected events .",
    "thus , if these models are correct , the microlensing events are very unlikely to come from the known stellar populations .    for the case of an lmc halo plus lmc disk , lmc disk self - lensing must be smaller since part of the lmc rotation curve is supported by the halo .",
    "in this case some of the lensing can come from the dark halo .",
    "this changes the predictions of macho halo fraction , since the lmc halo contributes very little to the total mass of the milky way , but relatively more to the microlensing .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab - like ] , for model s we find 1.1 events from the lmc halo , and 2.1 background events using the set a. for set b we find 1.4 lmc halo events , with 2.7 background stellar events .",
    "again , the expected number of background events is significantly smaller than the number of observed events .",
    "when an lmc dark halo is included the events from the lmc halo count towards dark matter that is not uniformly spread across the sky . the predicted values change from @xmath236 to @xmath237 and from @xmath238 to @xmath239 for set a , and from @xmath240 to @xmath241 , and from @xmath242 to @xmath243 for set b. the change in macho fraction is small because our lmc halo has an optical depth of @xmath244 , substantially smaller than the @xmath245 contributed by model s , and the lmc disk contributes more background when no halo is present .",
    "the most likely total mass in machos in the milky way dark halo ( within 50 kpc ) shows an expected drop of about 10% , ( from @xmath246 to @xmath247 ) when an lmc dark halo is included . as we discuss below , with model f , which has a very small milky way halo , the change in @xmath159 and the change in total macho mass is much more substantial .",
    "finally we note that with a typical halo model like s , the likelihood contours in all cases rule out a 100% macho halo at high significance .",
    "this was not true in a97 , or in any previous microlensing data set .",
    "( but see the very recent eros ii reports @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our sensitivity to events longer than a thousand days is small , so we can not rule out dark matter objects with masses of tens of solar masses .",
    "several interesting features can be seen in table  [ tab - like ] and figures  [ fig - like - cow ] , [ fig - like - b ] , and [ fig - like - f ] .    examination of the likelihood contours show that with our new data set , the uncertain nature of the milky halo dominates over poisson error and the systematic error caused by our selection criteria . for each model ,",
    "the most likely values and confidence limits are nearly the same , while between models there are significant differences .",
    "this is an improvement over a96 and a97 where small number statistics dominated the errors .",
    "the values found are typically within 1.5 sigma of those reported in a97 , but a factor of two smaller for reasons given above .",
    "as noted in a96 and a97 , the most likely halo fraction , @xmath159 , depends strongly on the halo model , with massive halos such as model b giving small macho fraction ( @xmath248% ) , medium halos such as model s giving medium values ( @xmath249% ) , and very low - mass halos such as model f giving large fractions ( @xmath250% - 60% ) . however , there are some model independent conclusions that can be drawn .",
    "the total predicted mass in machos within 50 kpc ( column 5 ) is about @xmath251 for all models .",
    "this is again a factor of two smaller than reported in a97 for the same reasons .",
    "however , for very small halos , such as model f , the total macho mass is somewhat dependent on the model of the lmc halo . with no dark lmc halo ,",
    "masses up to @xmath252 are found , while with a large dark lmc halo , the prediction drops to @xmath253 .",
    "this is because this mw halo has an optical depth of only @xmath254 , compared to @xmath255 for our lmc halo .",
    "so with the large macho fraction caused by the very small mw halo , the lmc halo can contribute substantially to microlensing without contributing much to the mass within 50 kpc .",
    "note , however , that when one sums the _ total _ macho contribution to microlensing optical depth ( mw halo plus lmc halo ) , the result is @xmath256 almost completely independent of the mw and lmc halo models .",
    "this is shown in column  6 of table  [ tab - like ] .",
    "these values and their confidence intervals are simple to interpret statistically , since each model provides a distribution of event durations . thus the subtleties discussed in section  [ sec - tau ] are absent .",
    "we note that these values include only the lmc and mw halo contributions , and are close to the values we obtained in our direct estimates of optical depth .",
    "interestingly , for models s and b , halos consisting 100% of machos are strongly ruled - out .",
    "even for the rather extreme model f , and no lmc halo , a 100% macho halo is ruled - out .",
    "the only way this data is consistent with a 100% macho halo is if there is an extremely small mw halo coupled with a very small lmc halo .",
    "this is the strongest limit to date on an all macho halo and is a major result of this work .",
    "we note that we do not set strong limits on dark matter objects with masses in the tens of solar mass range .",
    "however , the @xmath251 in machos found in this work still represents several times the mass of all known stellar components of the milky way . if the bulk of the lenses are located in the halo , then they represent the dominant identified component of our galaxy , and a major portion of the dark matter .    while @xmath257 and the total mass are fairly model independent , as discussed in a96 and a97 ,",
    "the typical mass of a macho , @xmath160 , is not .",
    "lighter halo models such as f have a smaller implied macho mass @xmath258 , while heavier halos such as b have @xmath259 , and medium halos such as s giving @xmath260 .",
    "sets a and b also differ slightly in this parameter .",
    "we conclude that our estimate of @xmath160 is not very robust , but that masses below the brown dwarf limit of @xmath261 are quite unlikely .",
    "therefore , the nature of the lenses remains unclear .",
    "finally , using table  [ tab - like ] , and comparing the number of expected events from the mw halo with the number of expected events from known stellar populations , one can ask how strong is the case for any macho contribution to the dark matter . for set a , the known stellar background ranges from 2.1 to 3.2 events depending upon the lmc and mw halo model . for set b",
    ", the range is 2.7 to 4.2 stellar events .",
    "if our models of the mw thin disk , thick disk , spheroid , and lmc disk are adequate then it is very unlikely to find 13 ( or 17 ) events when expecting no more than 3.2 ( or 4.2 ) ( probability less than @xmath262 in both cases ) .",
    "we note that the lmc disk we use in the pure - disk model is conservatively large ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "the question remains whether an lmc halo could supply the observed microlensing .",
    "the halo we use is a good fit to the available data , ( @xmath264 within 8 kpc ) , and the rotation curve for this halo plus lmc disk is a good fit to the data @xcite .",
    "now , due to the lack of stellar tracers found with velocity dispersion of the @xmath265 km / s expected for a halo population , we have assumed that this lmc halo is dark .",
    "a large dark halo is , of course , typical of dwarf spiral galaxies such as the lmc . so assuming the halo consists of a fraction @xmath159 of machos , is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "table  [ tab - like ] shows almost no difference in predicted background or other quantities for models s and b that have medium to large dark halos ; however , for the very small halo model f , nearly half the expected events come from stars or the lmc halo .",
    "the likely final halo fraction , is still nearly 50% , but with substantially larger error bars .",
    "figure  [ fig - like - f ] shows , however , that even in this case , a no - macho halo is quite unlikely .",
    "recently , several groups @xcite have considered lensing by an extended stellar population around the lmc , and have obtained different estimates of the optical depth contribution .",
    "interestingly , graff ,  ( 1999 ) claim tentative ( @xmath266 ) detection of a kinematically distinct population .",
    "we therefore explore the effect this would have on our maximum likelihood analysis , by considering the effect of an lmc halo consisting of macho fraction @xmath159 and a milky way halo with no macho population ( thus presumably consisting entirely of exotic elementary particles ) .",
    "the likelihood maximum for such a model gives @xmath267 , and @xmath268 for set a , and gives @xmath269 , and @xmath270 for set b. thus a possible non - dark - matter explanation for our results is an lmc halo of mass @xmath271 , consisting of stellar - like objects that have not yet been convincingly observed .",
    "this value of lmc halo mass is somewhat extreme , though there are published models with masses this high .",
    "clearly it is important to discover , or convincingly rule - out , the possibility of a large lmc stellar halo .",
    "we have detected between 13 and 17 microlensing events towards the lmc .",
    "the implied optical depth , microlensing rate , and macho halo fraction are a factor of two smaller than found in our previous work , but are consistent with previous results within the errors of small number statistics .",
    "the larger number of events allows us to reduce the poisson error considerably , which along with our improved efficiency analysis and study of sources of systematic error , means that the interpretation of the microlensing events is now dominated by uncertainties in the models of the milky way and lmc .",
    "we find that the number of events is not consistent with known lens sources and our measured optical depth , @xmath272 , is significantly larger than allowed by known galactic and lmc stellar populations .",
    "the total implied mass in machos within 50 kpc is @xmath273 , quite independent of the dark halo model .",
    "this is substantially larger than all known stellar components of the galaxy .",
    "however , one of our most important conclusions is that a 100% all macho milky way halo is ruled out at the 95% c.l . for a wide range of reasonable models .",
    "one explanation of our results is a milky way halo consisting of about 20% machos .",
    "another possibility is an lmc halo that dominates the microlensing , and no machos in the milky way halo .",
    "the spatial distribution of events makes lensing entirely by a stellar population in the lmc disk or bar less likely , but given the highly uncertain nature of an lmc halo , a previously unknown stellar component or an lmc halo consisting of macho dark matter , could explain the measured optical depth , the number of observed events and their spatial distribution on the sky .",
    "we note , however , that no known lmc stellar population exhibits kinematics of this nature .",
    "it would help to constrain the kinematics of old populations in the lmc and to look for new populations that could represent the lenses .",
    "a direct measurement of the distance to some lmc lenses would be especially useful in distinguishing the two possibilities above .",
    "there is intriguing evidence for a population of white dwarfs ( ibata 1999 ; mndez & minniti 1999 ) in the hubble deep fields ( north and south ) , consistent with the milky way halo hypothesis .",
    "these results were spawned primarily by the recent work of hansen ( 1999 ) on low temperature white dwarf cooling curves .",
    "although the identification of these faint - blue objects as white dwarfs remains to be confirmed and the small sample size restricts an accurate estimate , the suggestion that these white dwarfs could contribute 1/3 to 1/2 of the dark matter in the milky way is certainly stimulating in light of the present work .",
    "a third epoch hdf image to check the proper motion of these objects should help confirm or rule - out this hypothesis .",
    "a galactic halo composed of @xmath274% by mass of white dwarfs would seem to be a natural explanation of both the microlensing data and this newly observed population , but the formation of such objects and the chemical enrichment they would cause trigger serious concern @xcite .",
