    "the central density profile of dark matter halos around galaxies and galaxy clusters is now highlighted in the dark matter cosmology .",
    "@xcite have performed cosmological n - body simulations based on cold dark matter models and show that the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos have self - similar profiles . the profile ( hereafter , nfw profile )",
    "is thought to be the final relaxed state of self - gravitating collisionless particles and thereby called a universal profile .",
    "the nfw profile has a central cusp diverging as @xmath4 .",
    "recent simulations with higher resolution have confirmed existence of a universal profile but show that the central density profile gets steeper and is better represented by @xmath5 @xcite although slight variation of the central density profiles from halo to halo is reported @xcite .",
    "rotation curve measurements for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that central density profiles are flat and a density profile with a central cusp is inconsistent with the mass distribution of dwarf galaxies . to solve the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the observations for dwarf galaxies , @xcite have proposed that the dark matter has a finite cross - section to allow strong self - interactions between the dark matter particles themselves .",
    "this type of dark matter is called self - interacting dark matter ( hereafter , sidm ) .",
    "the introduction of the self - interaction may reduce the central mass concentration found in the universal profile obtained by pure collisionless dark matter simulations .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of central density profiles of dark matter halos is one of the key questions to solve the nature of the dark matter .    both observational and theoretical studies",
    "have been done to constrain the sidm cross - section .",
    "higher resolution measurements of rotation curves of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have rejected the central profile of @xmath6 although the data can not discriminate whether the central density profiles have constant density cores or @xmath7 cuspy profiles .",
    "miralda - escude ( 2000 ) has shown that ellipticity of the dark halo core of the lensing cluster is rather high using the strong lensing data .",
    "he has proposed to use the measured ellipticity to give an upper limit on the sidm cross - section . @xcite",
    "have performed n - body simulations of cluster formation with various values of sidm cross - sections .",
    "they show that a few collisions per particle per hubble time at the halo center can substantially affect the central density profile .",
    "therefore , precise measurements of central density profiles can provide a strong constraint on the sidm cross - section .",
    "we examine how a number ratio of radial arcs to tangential arcs depends on the central density profile of galaxy clusters .",
    "a radial arc is a gravitationally lensed image whose major axis lies in the radial direction of a cluster - lens potential .",
    "a tangential arc is a gravitationally lensed image whose major axis lies in the tangential direction of a cluster - lens potential .",
    "we define ` radial arc statistics ' as a statistical average of number ratios of radial arcs to tangential arcs found in a certain cluster sample .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed an arc statistics for probing the central density profile of galaxy clusters . in their arc statistics , the absolute frequency of finding arcs appeared in a cluster must be used . however , the absolute frequency of finding arcs in a certain cluster sample is known to be sensitive to yet uncertain parameters e.g.   evolution of background galaxies and details of mass distribution of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "no model has succeeded to reproduce the observed high frequency of finding arcs yet . as shown in this paper ,",
    "the proposed radial arc statistics is free from the systematic errors coming from above uncertainties . throughout this paper , a cosmological model of @xmath8",
    "is assumed .",
    "the density profile we use is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale radius , @xmath11 is the critical density times the ( dimensionless ) characteristic over - density , and adopted values of @xmath12 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a projected mass @xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the line - of - sight direction . ) and @xmath19 the lens equation reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a source position , @xmath22 is an image position , @xmath23 is called lens parameter and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the angular distance from the observer to the lens , @xmath26 is that from the lens to the source galaxy , @xmath27 is that from the observer to the source galaxy , and @xmath28 is the critical surface mass density . for example",
    ", @xmath29 corresponds to a cluster at redshift of @xmath30 with a virial temperature @xmath31 kev and a source redshift of @xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an expected number ratio of radial arcs to tangential arcs is calculated by calculating a ratio of a cross - section forming radial arcs to that forming tangential arcs .",
    "it is assumed that source galaxies are circular and their size is infinitesimal , i.e.   lensing magnification matrix is same everywhere in the source and is represented by that at the source center . a quantity @xmath33 represents stretching - contracting factor in the radial direction of a lens potential . a quantity @xmath34 represents stretching - contracting factor in the tangential direction of a lens potential .",
    "hereafter , we use the word ` radial arc ' for an image which satisfies @xmath35 and ` tangential arc ' for an image which satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "the axis ratios of a radial arc @xmath37 and a tangential arc @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the radial and tangential cross - sections are calculated by solving the following inequalities : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the threshold axis ratio .",
    "we calculate ratios of radial cross - sections to tangential cross - sections for @xmath42 .",
    "the nfw profile corresponds to @xmath43 .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the expected number ratios of radial arcs whose axis ratios are larger than the threshold value @xmath41 , to tangential arcs which have the same threshold axis ratio , against the threshold axis ratio @xmath41 .",
    "calculations were done for @xmath44 and @xmath45 which cover almost all practical combinations of cluster redshifts and their masses , and source redshifts .",
    "figure 1 shows that the number ratios drastically vary with @xmath12 values and variation due to variation of @xmath46 values is much smaller .",
    "this indicates that the number ratios of radial arcs to tangential arcs in a certain cluster sample is a powerful probe for the central density profile of galaxy clusters .",
    "biases in selection of a cluster sample may be reflected in biases of cluster masses and their redshifts , and the deepness of the observations which is equivalent to source redshifts .",
    "changing values of these parameters only results in change of @xmath46 values .",
    "therefore , insensitivity of the radial arc statistics to @xmath46 values shows that the selection biases of a cluster sample less affects the constraint from the radial arc statistics on the central density profile .",
    "a dramatic increase of the radial arc number with increasing of @xmath12 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 found in figure 1 can be understood as follows .",
    "when the central density profile is gentler than @xmath49 , a lens could have radial caustics where the stretching factor in the radial direction become infinite , and radial arcs are produced in two different ways @xcite .",
    "when the central density profile is gentler than @xmath6 , radial arcs are produced only when source galaxies touch the radial caustics .",
    "on the other hand , when the central density profile is steeper than @xmath6 , the width of the source image along the tangential direction is contracted .",
    "therefore , radial arcs can be produced without significant stretching in the radial direction . as a result",
    ", the number of radial arcs are dramatically increased when the central density profile is steeper than @xmath6 . since intrinsic source size of @xmath50 galaxies at a redshift of @xmath51 which are the dominant sources of observed arcs ,",
    "is @xmath51 arcsec , high resolution instruments with the full - width - at - half - maximum of better than @xmath52 arcsec . , like _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , _ subaru _ etc .",
    ", is required to make a reliable sample for the radial arc statistics .",
    "in table 1 , we list clusters for which existence of radial arcs were reported . in most of the cases ,",
    "the radial arcs are thin and small .",
    "special attention is necessary to find a radial arc even on the _ hst _ images",
    ". the listed clusters in table 1 could be only a set for which existence or non - existence of radial arcs have been securely checked .",
    "this sample is , of course , not uniform and is highly biased by the interests of the observer for each cluster .",
    "however , as mentioned in previous section , our radial arc statistics is little affected by the selection biases .",
    "we could safely use this sample for the comparison with theoretical results .",
    "the hyphenated arcs in table 1 are folded or separated but nearly folded images and , therefore , each ` hyphenated arcs ' is counted as a single arc because those ( nearly ) folded images are produced from a single source .",
    "the length of these arcs is calculated as a half ( in the case of merging of two images ) or one third ( in the case of merging of three images ) of the total length . since all of the reported radial arcs have axis ratio larger than @xmath53 , the threshold value can be set to @xmath53 .",
    "tangential arcs with axis ratios larger than @xmath53 in the same clusters are also listed in table 1 .",
    "table 1 shows that the observational number ratio of radial arcs to tangential arcs is @xmath54 on average .",
    "this indicates @xmath55 .",
    "the central density profile with @xmath56 over - produces radial arcs and can be rejected . on the other hand ,",
    "the central density profile with @xmath57 predicts too few radial arcs compared with the observed results and also can be rejected .",
    "therefore , the radial arc statistics supports that the central density profile of cluster is in the range of @xmath58 and dark matter is collisionless at least on the cluster scale .",
    "we have shown that the radial arc statistics which is defined as a number ratio of radial arcs to tangential arcs appeared in a certain sample of clusters , strongly depends on the central density profile , and is almost independent of other cluster properties and source redshifts . therefore",
    ", our radial arc statistics which uses the number ratio can provide a robust test to constrain the central density profile of galaxy clusters .",
    "a tentative comparison with observations shows that the cluster central density profile is as steep as @xmath58 .",
    "this result indicates that the dark matter should be collisionless at least in cluster scale .",
    "therefore , even if the dark matter has a finite collision cross - section of the self - interaction @xmath1 , the mean free time @xmath59 of a dark matter particle ( mass @xmath3 ) should be longer than a cluster age @xmath60 .",
    "the mean free time @xmath59 can be estimated as @xmath61 where @xmath62 km / s is a cluster 3d velocity dispersion , assuming that a characteristic density of the dark matter in clusters is represented by @xmath11 . assuming a cluster redshift of @xmath30 , its virial temperature of @xmath63 kev , and a cluster age of @xmath64 gyr , the upper limit is obtained as @xmath65 . according to the numerical simulations",
    "@xcite , this upper limit allows weak self - interaction of the dark matter which produces a finite core in cluster mass distribution .",
    "therefore , the above mentioned upper limit on @xmath66 should be taken as conservative limit . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the collision rate expected from this small cross - section in the dwarf galaxies is too small to reproduce core radii of dwarf galaxies inferred from rotation curve measurements .",
    "therefore , the existence of cores in dwarf galaxies is still mystery .",
    "although we have assumed infinitesimal source size , this assumption is valid only if a variation of the lensing amplification within a source is negligible . in figure 2",
    ", we show the width of the region on the source plane which satisfies the condition of eq.(6 ) for a infinitesimal source .",
    "the width is scaled by @xmath27 , for each threshold axis ratio using a typical value of @xmath67 and @xmath68 mpc . since size of @xmath50 galaxy",
    "is @xmath51 arcsec at a redshift of @xmath51 which is the dominant source for arcs , figure 2 shows that the infinitesimal source approximation could provide reasonable estimations for the frequency of the tangential arcs but this assumption could not be good approximation for estimating the frequency of radial arcs for @xmath69 .",
    "the quantitative studies of the effect of the finite source extents as well as the lens - clusters ellipticity and irregularity in mass distribution , will be done in the forthcoming paper .    the cluster sample used for comparison with theoretical prediction",
    "should be improved .",
    "it should be mentioned , for example , that all the clusters listed in table 1 are xd clusters .",
    "an xd cluster is a cluster which has a bright elliptical galaxy at the center of the x - ray emission .",
    "since radial arcs are expected to appear in the very central region of a galaxy cluster and all the radial arcs listed in table 1 are found near cds , it must be checked whether a local central density increment by the mass of the cd galaxy plays an important role on forming radial arcs",
    ". therefore much more number of clusters , including non - xd clusters , should be included in the radial arc statistics sample by future high resolution observation .",
