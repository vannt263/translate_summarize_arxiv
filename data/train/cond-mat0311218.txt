    "one dimensional driven diffusive systems have been shown in the last decade to demonstrate a variety of non - trivial types of behavior .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems with local interactions , driven systems were shown to exhibit boundary induced phase transitions , phase separation and spontaneous symmetry breaking even when the dynamics is local @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon was first demonstrated for a driven two - species model with open boundary conditions , which became known as the ` bridge model ' @xcite .",
    "this model is defined on an open lattice , where two species of particles , which can be thought of as carrying opposite ` charges ' , are moving in opposite directions .",
    "although the dynamical rules which define the model are symmetric under charge exchange and left - right reflection , a mean - field approach and monte carlo simulations showed the existence of two phases in which this symmetry is broken .",
    "this result was subsequently supported by an exact solution for the limit of small extraction rates at the boundaries @xcite . until recently , studies of one dimensional driven systems focused on conserving bulk dynamics .",
    "non - conserving dynamics was only considered at certain sites , namely defect sites or boundaries .",
    "recently , the existence of phase transitions in driven systems without bulk particle conservation was demonstrated , both for finite non - conserving rates @xcite and for rates which scale to zero with the system size @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a variant of the bridge model , in which non - conserving dynamics is introduced in the bulk of the system .",
    "all dynamical rates , both conserving and non - conserving , respect the cp - symmetry between the two species of particles . by its nature , this dynamics acts to balance the densities of the two species .",
    "if the non - conserving transitions occur at finite rates , spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur .",
    "however , we find that when these rates are inversely proportional to the system size , spontaneous symmetry breaking appears . this model is related to the single - species non - conserving asymmetric exclusion process which was introduced and studied recently @xcite . as in that model ,",
    "the two - species model exhibits new phases with localized shocks .",
    "transitions in the phase diagram can be understood by considering the position of the localized shocks .",
    "furthermore , the phenomenon of induced localized shocks is observed , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains the definition of the model . in section [ sec : mft ] we calculate the phase diagram within mean - field approximation , for some cases where the bulk dynamics of the two species are decoupled .",
    "different limits of the model are discussed , and in particular the phase diagram of the bridge model is recovered as the non - conserving rates are reduced to zero .",
    "next , we present in section [ sec : mc ] results of monte - carlo simulations , and compare them with the predictions of mean - field analysis . the phenomenon of induced shocks is addressed in section [ sec : induced ] . in section [ sec :",
    "toy ] we present an exact solution for the case where fluctuations in the number of particles in the system are taken to zero .",
    "a physical picture is introduced and analyzed in section [ sec : pic ] .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the model considered in this paper is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath0 .",
    "each lattice site can either be occupied by a positive ( @xmath1 ) particle , occupied by a negative ( @xmath2 ) particle , or vacant ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the system evolves through three types of stochastic rates : in the bulk of the system particles move on the lattice according to the rates @xmath4 in addition , each site in the bulk of the system , @xmath5 , can change its state with rates @xmath6 corresponding to charge exchange , desorption of a particle from the lattice , and adsorption of a particle at an empty site . at the boundaries particles",
    "may be introduced and removed . at the left boundary ,",
    "site @xmath7 , positive particles are introduced and negative particles are removed with rates @xmath8 while at the right boundary , @xmath9 , negative particles are introduced and positive particles are removed with rates @xmath10 note that all dynamical rules , conserving and non - conserving , are cp - symmetric , namely symmetric under the exchange of positive - negative charges and left - right directions .",
    "generalizations of this model to the case were both types of particles can move in both directions , and when the dynamical rules break the cp symmetry , will be considered elsewhere .",
    "considering the bulk non - conserving rates , one distinguishes three possible scenarios @xcite .",
    "if the rates are finite , in the thermodynamic limit the bulk densities are dominated by the non conserving kinetics .",
    "otherwise , if the rates decay to zero faster than @xmath11 , the bulk non - conservation should have no effect , and the properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit are identical to those with bulk conservation .",
    "the third case , which we consider here , is the one in which the non - conserving rates scale down linearly with the system size .",
    "it is useful to introduce the notation @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .    without the non - conserving dynamics in the bulk of the system , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates2 ] ) , the model is identical to the bridge model introduced in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "let us summarize first the known results for this model",
    ". at @xmath15 mean - field analysis predicts the following phase diagram @xcite .",
    "two phases which obey the cp - symmetry of the model are identified : a maximal - current phase , where the bulk density of each species equals @xmath16 , and a low - density phase , where the bulk densities of both species are identical , both smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the model exhibits two phases in which the symmetries are broken . in one phase , termed the low - high phase , one of the species , spontaneously chosen , sustains a bulk density larger than @xmath16 , while the bulk density of the other is smaller than @xmath16 . in the other phase both species",
    "sustain low albeit non - equal densities .",
    "this phase spans a very small area of the mean - field phase diagram , and is very difficult to recover in monte - carlo simulations .",
    "consequently , the existence of this low - density asymmetric phase under noisy dynamics has been the subject of some debate @xcite .",
    "the model considered here can be thought of as two interacting single - species totally asymmetric exclusion processes with bulk non - conservation ( nc - tasep ) .",
    "the nc - tasep is an extension of the well - known totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite with bulk absorption and desorption dynamics . using mean - field calculations @xcite , which were argued to be exact @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagram of this model was obtained .",
    "in addition to the three phases of the tasep , namely the maximal - current phase , the high - density phase and the low - density phase , it was found that the nc - tasep may also exhibit four additional phases .",
    "the most interesting one is a shock phase which consists of a localized shock in the bulk of the system , separating a low - density region to its left from a high - density region to its right . in the bulk - conserving tasep shocks appear only on the boundary line between the high - density and low - density phases . on that line a delocalized",
    "shock appears in the system . as the position of the shock is equally probable at any site in the system , the average profile on the transition line is linear .",
    "in contrast , the nc - tasep exhibits a distinct phase in which a localized shock , whose position is selected by the dynamics , is present .",
    "the existence of this phase plays a main role in our analysis of the two - species model .",
    "the maximal - current phase of the tasep appears in the nc - tasep only when the two non - conserving rates , namely particle absorption and desorption , are equal . in this case there",
    "exist three more phases .",
    "these include a low - max phase , in which the density increases linearly from a boundary density @xmath17 towards density @xmath16 , where it remains constant for the rest of the system ; a max - high phase , in which the density rises linearly from a constant profile of density @xmath16 to a boundary density @xmath18 ; and a low - max - high phase , in which the density rises linearly from a left - boundary density @xmath17 towards @xmath16 , where it remains constant up to a point where it climbs linearly again towards a right - boundary density @xmath18 .",
    "in this section we study the mean - field equations of our model in the thermodynamic limit @xmath19 .",
    "we introduce the occupation variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) if site @xmath24 is occupied by a positive ( negative ) particle , and @xmath3 otherwise .",
    "the densities of the positive and negative particles are then defined by @xmath25 where angular brackets denote averaging over realizations .",
    "the time evolution of the particle densities is governed by @xmath26 where the currents are given by @xmath27 and the source terms are @xmath28 at the boundaries the source terms vanish , and the currents are given by @xmath29 the mean - field theory for this model is defined by replacing two - point correlation functions with products of one - point averages .",
    "within this approximation , the currents become @xmath30 in the steady - state all time derivatives vanish , and one has @xmath31 defining @xmath32 , one notices that in fact @xmath33 and @xmath34 are conserved throughout the lattice , and @xmath35 .",
    "the case @xmath36 is special , as in this case the bulk equations ( [ eq : evolution ] ) with the mean - field currents ( [ eq : mfbulk ] ) are decoupled .",
    "the currents and source terms in this case are just @xmath37 \\nonumber\\\\ j^{-}_{i } & = & m_i\\left(1-m_{i-1}\\right ) & \\eqspace s^{-}_i & = & \\frac{\\omega}{n}\\left[1-(2+u_d)m_i\\right]\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] in the bulk of the system , the hopping rates for say a positive particle do not distinguish between a negative particle and a vacancy . also , the fact that attachment of a positive particle is limited by the presence of negative ones , is exactly compensated by the charge exchange rate .",
    "the coupling between the two species is limited in this case only to the boundaries . following @xcite ,",
    "one readily notices that upon the definition @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the problem is reduced to two single - species nc - tasep .",
    "one process corresponds to the positive particles with injection rate @xmath40 at the left boundary and ejection rate @xmath41 at the right , and the other to the negative particles with injection rate @xmath42 at the right boundary and ejection rate @xmath41 at the left .",
    "the two processes may or may not share the same phase .",
    "the latter case corresponds to a phase of the two - species system , where the symmetry between the two species is broken . in the other case",
    ", it may be that the average densities of the two species are not equal , although the two lie in the same phase of the corresponding nc - tasep .",
    "a trivial restriction on the possible phases in the model is @xmath43 at all sites .",
    "this immediately excludes several possibilities , such as ones which mix the high - density phase of one species with anything but the low - density of the other .    in this section",
    "we explore the possible phases in the bulk decoupled case .",
    "symmetric phases are presented first , followed by asymmetric phases . in the symmetric phases , @xmath44 ,",
    "so for these phases only @xmath40 is quoted in the following . for the asymmetric phases it is always assumed , with no loss of generality , that the positive particles are in the majority .",
    "when describing density profiles we always take a language in which the lattice is rescaled to the segment @xmath45 $ ] .",

    "we now turn to describe the emerging phase diagram .",

    "in fact , all asymmetric phases reside in regions of phase space where the low - density symmetric state is also stationary . which of the solutions is realized is a matter of stability , as will be discussed shortly .",

    "note that at the higher value of @xmath58 no asymmetric phases exist , while at the smaller value all phases described in the previous section exist .",
    "this fact will be addressed below .",
    "taking @xmath58 to zero the original phase diagram of the bridge model is retrieved , as discussed in subsection [ sec : omega0 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , all asymmetric phases reside in regions of phase space in which the symmetric low density is also a stationary solution of the mean - field equations . on the mean field level ,",
    "the realization of one stationary solution rather than the other is a matter of initial conditions . in all cases both",
    "the symmetric and asymmetric solutions are linearly stable . however , any initial condition for which the density of at least one of the two species is higher than @xmath16 in some region evolves into the state of broken symmetry .",
    "thus a disordered initial condition , in which the density of particles at any site is an independent uniformly distributed random variable , resides in the basin of attraction of the asymmetric solution .    considering the model beyond mean - field approximation , where the dynamics is noisy",
    ", one expects a random perturbation to take the system away from the symmetric solution . in physical terms",
    "this can be understood by the fact that nucleation of a high density domain leads to its flow towards the boundary , where it reduces the inflow of particles of the other species due to the exclusion interaction .",
    "once the symmetry is broken , the high density phase expands and takes its steady state position .",
    "this picture is substantiated in a quantitative manner for the limit @xmath98 in section [ sec : toy ] .",
    "note that this line of argument can not be followed for the asymmetric low phase .",
    "so far we have considered the case @xmath99 , where detachment of particles from the bulk is suppressed . in this case",
    "the non - conserving rates allow for attachment of particles of either species with rate @xmath100 and for charge exchange with rate @xmath101 .",
    "while the former process affects the densities of both species in the same way , the charge exchange process tends to diminish the density difference between species .",
    "thus it is clear that for large @xmath102 , when this process becomes dominant , the asymmetric phases will vanish .",
    "this effect can only increase in the presence of detachment , which acts stronger on the majority species . in the case",
    "@xmath99 we find that the high - low phase ceases to exist beyond @xmath103 .",
    "the shock - low phase vanishes at @xmath104 , and with it the low asymmetric phase .",
    "the vanishing of the asymmetric phases can be understood in a more quantitative manner from the blockage picture described in section [ sec : pic ] .      in the limit of @xmath105",
    "the non - conserving model considered here must coincide with the bridge model . in this limit",
    ", the point @xmath106 defined above is shifted towards the origin .",
    "the point @xmath93 is pushed to infinity , which means that the low - max - high symmetric phase can not exist .",
    "the boundary line between the low symmetric and the shock symmetric phase is given generally by @xmath107 thus @xmath108 for all @xmath89 as @xmath105 , and the shock symmetric phase can not exist . furthermore the low - max symmetric phase vanishes in this limit .",
    "the boundary between this phase and the maximal - current phase , @xmath109 coincides in the limit @xmath105 with its boundary with the low phase , @xmath110 thus , of the symmetric phases only the maximal - current phase and the low phase remain in the @xmath105 limit , as expected from the bridge model .    as for the asymmetric phases , one notices in the same way that as @xmath58 decreases , the high - low phase region grows on the expense of the shock - low phase . as @xmath105 ,",
    "the boundary lines of both phases coincide , and the shock - low phase ceases to exist .",
    "exact expressions for these phase boundaries are rather lengthy , and are omitted here .",
    "finally , the low density asymmetric phase takes in the @xmath105 limit its form as in the bridge model .",
    "7 cm    we now turn to consider a more general case , still within the bulk - decoupled regime ( @xmath112 ) , where the non - conserving dynamics includes detachment of particles .",
    "this case corresponds to the nc - tasep with non - equal attachment and detachment rates .",
    "the phase diagram of that model includes only three phases : high density , low density and localized shock .",
    "all phases where a part of the profile is constant at @xmath16 do not exist .",
    "this comes from the fact that the equilibrium density of the kinetics is given by the langmuir density rather than @xmath16 .",
    "the phase diagram of our model in the case @xmath111 exhibits only two symmetric phases - the symmetric low - density phase and the shock symmetric one .",
    "all asymmetric phases which were obtained for the case @xmath113 are also present here . as in the nc - tasep ,",
    "the density profiles in this case are not linear , but rather curved .",
    "this makes the analysis of the phase diagram somewhat more cumbersome , although not different in principle from the one presented in section [ sec : wd0 ] .",
    "details of this calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "in figure [ fig : pdwd ] we plot the mean - field phase diagram for the cases @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is defined as before by @xmath117 . the boundary line between the asymmetric low - density phase and the symmetric low phase is not presented .",
    "we could not obtain the boundary densities in this phase in a closed form . for several values of @xmath116",
    "we have found numerically that this line lies just above the transition line between the shock - low phase and the asymmetric low phase .",
    "certainly , the region of phase space covered by this phase does not increase compared with the case @xmath118 .",
    "it is readily noticed that the part of phase space spanned by the high - low asymmetric phase decreases as @xmath119 is increased .",
    "this is expected from the fact that the detachment process acts stronger on the majority phase , thus reducing its density . for any given @xmath58 the detachment process",
    "can be increased to a level in which the high - low asymmetric phase does not occur .",
    "the detachment process can be considered as cooperating with the boundary ejection rate @xmath41 , and competing with the boundary injection rate @xmath89 .",
    "it is no surprise then that the asymmetric shock - low phase grows in the @xmath89 direction of phase space and shrinks in the @xmath41 direction as @xmath119 is increased . in the regions of phase space which compose the three phases identified only for the case @xmath99 , the density profiles approach continuously , as @xmath119 is decreased towards zero , to the ones described in the corresponding phases of the @xmath99 case .",
    "as was already noticed in earlier works about the bridge model @xcite , the mean field phase diagram captures the correct topology of the phase boundary lines .",
    "the exact location of the boundary lines , however , is shifted in the noisy model with regard to those of the mean field solution . for our model",
    "we did not try to obtain the exact location of the phase boundary lines from monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "still we note , based on our simulations , that these lines can not lie too far from those of the mean - field phase diagram obtained in the previous section . here",
    "we concentrate on giving evidence for each of the phases by finding representative points in parameter space . in figure",
    "[ fig : mcprofiles ] we present the density profiles of the two species in the different phases as obtained from mc simulations .",
    "the profiles in each phase were taken at the same parameters as the respective mean field profiles shown in figures [ fig : mfsymm ] and [ fig : mfasymm ] .",
    "for all phases shown here the mean field profiles capture the features of the noisy model .",

    "finally , a positive ( negative ) particle can change its species with rate @xmath155 @xmath156 , and move from one particle block to the other .",

    "this corresponds to a symmetric shock phase in the model , where the shock position of the positive particles is @xmath172 , with @xmath166 given by ( [ eq : toyfixedpt ] ) .",
    "otherwise the system is in the high - low asymmetric phase , with the line @xmath173 serving as the transition line between the two phases .    for the bulk - decoupled case , @xmath174 and @xmath15 , it is illuminating to compare these exact results with the ones obtained by mean field .",

    "the mean field transition line between the two phases ( [ eq : conds ] ) is identical , to first order in @xmath41 , to the line @xmath173 of the toy model .",
    "also the shock position @xmath67 calculated in the toy model is identical to first order in @xmath41 to the one ( [ eq : shockposition ] ) calculated in mean field .",
    "this result also holds in the case @xmath111 .",
    "we thus conclude that the mean - field solution is exact to first order in @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we combine the mean - field and stability analysis , the simulation results , and the toy model into a physical picture . following",
    "@xcite we term it the _ blockage picture_.    qualitatively , typical configurations in the asymmetric phases can be described in terms of blocks of the two species , which spread from the ` exit ' boundary into the system ( figure [ fig : blockage ] , and compare the toy model description in the previous section ) .",
    "the density profile within each block is not constant , but this feature is not relevant here . as mentioned above , a block of one species stalls the entry of particles of the other species through the boundaries , thus serving as a blockage . the possibility of particles to enter the system in the bulk serves to stabilize the domain size .    in the high - low phase the block of the majority species covers the entire system , while in the shock - low phase the block is limited to some part of the system .",
    "the fluctuations in the size of this block , corresponding to the width of the localized shock , are limited to an area of size @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the minority block in both phases is unstable in the sense that the domain wall between it and the bulk region drifts towards the boundary .",
    "averaging over the positions of the domain wall results in the exponential decay of the mean field density profile from the left boundary .",
    "in @xcite it was observed that an instantaneous configuration in the low - density asymmetric phases comprises a small block of the majority phase , which is limited to the vicinity of the boundary .",
    "the formation of this block prevents particles of the other species from entering the system , thus leading to symmetry breaking .",
    "however , this block does not survive for times which are exponential in the system size .",
    "the block picture is extended into the symmetric shock phase . here",
    "the two blocks are covering equal distances from the ` exit ' boundaries .",
    "the sizes of the two blocks are again macroscopic and localized , in the sense that the size fluctuations vanish as @xmath176 .",
    "we now turn to describe the different phases of the model in the language of block configurations . to this end",
    "we take a stroll along a line of constant @xmath89 in the phase diagram , starting from the symmetric shock phase and going up in @xmath41 .",
    "this line is chosen such that it cuts through all asymmetric phases .    in the shock symmetric phase ,",
    "the two blocks inhibit , in a symmetric way , the inflow of particles of the opposite species .",
    "increasing @xmath41 decreases the sizes of the two blocks .",
    "however , as long as their size is macroscopic , the blocks keep their role of lessening the ability of particles of the other species to enter the system .",
    "as the boundary line is approached , the size of the blocks is reduced to zero . now",
    "the road is open for both species to enter the system . due to fluctuations ,",
    "the formation of a block is inevitable . as @xmath41",
    "is increased beyond the transition line into the shock - low phase , the possibility rises that this block will be stabilized by the non - conserving dynamics . a spontaneously created block of one species , which now has a stable macroscopic size , hinders particles of the other species and breaks the symmetry between the two species .",
    "as @xmath41 is increased from its value at the boundary line between the symmetric shock phase and the shock - low phase , the size of the block of the majority species increases .",
    "this is due to the coupling between the ejection rate @xmath41 and the effective injection rates , which at this region of phase space serves to increase @xmath177 ( in mean - field this can be seen from eqs .",
    "[ eq : effective ] , [ eq : bcsl ] ) . at some value of @xmath41 ,",
    "the block reaches the size of the entire system , and there it stays for some range of @xmath41 .",
    "this , in fact , is the high - low phase of the system .",
    "as @xmath41 is increased further the size of the majority block shrinks back , and the system is again in the shock - low phase .",
    "the transition from the shock - low phase to the high - low phase at some @xmath41 , and the re - entrance to the shock - low phase at some higher @xmath41 , occur at these points where the size of the majority blockage becomes identical with the size of the system .",
    "towards the boundary line between the shock - low phase and the low - density phase the size of the majority block vanishes .",
    "the existence of a reminiscent block which yields the asymmetric low phase , as discussed in @xcite , can be either attributed to fluctuations of the localized shock , or to an alternative mechanism .",
    "15 cm    to make the blockage picture more quantitative , we calculate the size of the majority block in each phase .",
    "this is done within mean - field for the bulk - decoupled case . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath113 , where the profiles of the blocks are linear .",
    "the block size is then just @xmath178 , where the shock position @xmath67 is given in ( [ eq : shockposition ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : xs ] ( a ) we plot the size of the block as a function of @xmath41 at constant @xmath58 and @xmath89 . using the picture",
    "described above , one can identify the phase boundaries .",
    "the value of @xmath41 at which the blockage first disappears corresponds to the shock - symmetric to shock - low line .",
    "the two values between which the blockage spans the system are identified as the two lines between the shock - low and high - low phases .",
    "finally , the higher @xmath41 at which the blockage disappears completely corresponds to a transition into a low - density phase .",
    "it is easy to verify , by comparing with the mean - field phase diagram , that these are indeed that transition points between the phases .",
    "note that the low asymmetric phase escapes this picture .",
    "it is also possible to describe in terms of the block size ( or alternatively the shock position ) the fact that asymmetric phases disappear as @xmath58 is increased .",
    "the non - conserving dynamics in the bulk of the system serves to sustain the localized shock . keeping @xmath89 constant , for example",
    ", the increase in the amplitude of the non - conserving rates drives the position of the shock out of the system , thus decreasing the maximal size of the blockage . in terms of phases , this would decrease the segment on the @xmath41 axis in which the shock is localized at the ` entry ' boundary ( the high - low phase ) , down to a point where the shock can not get so far and the phase disappears . beyond this point ,",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : xs ] ( b ) , the position of the shock is driven back towards the ` exit ' boundary , thus reducing the shock - low phase until it is finally gone .",
    "in this work a two - species one - dimensional model , with dynamics which is not conserving both at the boundaries and in the bulk , has been studied .",
    "the dynamics is symmetric under charge exchange and left - right reflection . by definition the non - conserving dynamics in the bulk of the system acts to diminish the difference between the densities of the two species .",
    "nevertheless we have found that the symmetry between the two species can be broken even in the presence of bulk non - conserving processes .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram , obtained for the case where the bulk dynamics of the two species becomes decoupled , exhibits three phases in which the symmetry between the species is broken .",
    "one of these is unique to the case where the bulk dynamics is not conserving , and results from a localization of shocks in the density profiles .",
    "all asymmetric phases reside in regions of phase space where symmetric low - density profiles are another fixed point of the mean - field dynamics .",
    "however , stability arguments shows that it is the asymmetric solution which should be expected to survive fluctuations .",
    "indeed , comparing with monte - carlo simulations , two asymmetric phases are confirmed .",
    "the third , in which the average density of both species is below @xmath16 is more difficult to determine .",
    "in contrast to the bulk - conserving case , in this model the density profiles are generally not flat .",
    "in particular , localized shocks may be generated in the bulk of the system . in the general case , when the particle current of one species depends on the density of the other , a localized shock in the density profile of one species induces a shock in the other .    in the asymmetric phases , as well as in the shock symmetric phase",
    ", typical configurations can be described in terms three blocks .",
    "the leftmost block has a high density of negative particles , the middle block has a low density of particles of both species , and the right block is mainly occupied by positive particles .",
    "this observation serves to define a toy model which describes the dynamics of the system in terms of a two - dimensional random walker . solving the toy - model yields an exact solution for the case where the exit rates and the non - conserving rates are taken to zero .",
    "the results coincide with the ones obtained in mean - field at this limit . for the general case",
    "a more qualitative picture emerges , which serves to describe the phase transitions in the model in terms of the block sizes .",
    "the bulk of this work , as well as of those which studied the bridge model , has focused on the case in which the dynamics of the two species is decoupled in the bulk .",
    "the other , more general case , was studied only by numerical means , both on the mean - field level and in monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this enabled us to observe induced shocks .",
    "a more detailed study of this case by analytical means should shed more light on this phenomenon .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram of the nc - tasep is expected to be exact @xcite , while monte - carlo results suggest that this is not the case here .",
