    "surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) is the resonant excitation of the surface electromagnetic wave propagating at the metal - dielectric interface @xcite .",
    "this technique has become an important research tool in biophysics .",
    "the interest in it has been spurred by its potential for biosensing , the appearance of commercial instruments , and the general interest in plasmonics @xcite .",
    "the spr technique measures the refractive index or optical absorption with high sensitivity and is particularly advantageous for biosensing since ( i ) it is a label - free method @xcite , and ( ii ) it can monitor the kinetics of biological processes in real time .",
    "several overviews summarize spr applications in biology and biochemistry @xcite .",
    "in particular , spr in the visible range has been used to study membranes @xcite and cell cultures @xcite .",
    "the spr technique has been used in several modalities such as spr - enhanced fluorescence @xcite , spr imaging @xcite , and spr spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the majority of the spr applications use laser sources operating in the visible range .",
    "recently , however , several spr techniques operating in the near - infrared range have appeared @xcite , some of which use an ftir spectrometer as a light source @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional spr technique that operates with a laser source and employs angular interrogation , the ftir - spr technique operates with a continuum wavelength source and employs wavelength interrogation .",
    "so far , the ftir - spr techniques have utilized glass - based optics that limited its operation to the nir range .",
    "we extended the ftir - spr technique to mid - ir range using a zns prism @xcite .",
    "next , we will examine new opportunities offered by this technique .",
    "* _ high sensitivity_. since conductive losses in the infrared range are lower than those in the visible range , the infrared spr can be more sensitive than its visible range counterpart .",
    "* _ penetration depth _ of the surface plasmon in the visible range is very short .",
    "this is beneficial for studying very thin layers but detrimental for studying cells and cell cultures .",
    "the infrared surface plasmon penetrates much deeper and is more appropriate for studying cells . *",
    "_ fast multi - wavelength measurements_. the ability to detect spr at varying wavelengths and/or varying angles allows `` tuning '' the surface plasmon resonance to any desired spectral range in order to achieve high sensitivity and appropriate penetration depth . *",
    "_ spectroscopy_. since many biomolecules have specific absorption bands in the infrared range ( `` fingerprints '' ) , performing multiwavelength spr measurements in the spectral range of fingerprints , in principle , allows these biomolecules to be identified selectively .",
    "next , we will analyze the spr in the infrared and identify those niches where it is especially useful for biosensing .",
    "then we will discuss several ftir - spr applications developed in our group .",
    "surface plasmon ( sp ) is an electromagnetic wave @xmath0 that propagates along the metal - dielectric interface and exponentially decays in the perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "the surface plasmon dispersion relations in the dielectric and in the metal are correspondingly @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the wave vector in free space , and @xmath3 are the complex dielectric permittivities of the metal and of the dielectric , correspondingly , where @xmath4 . when the surface plasmon propagates along the interface between two unbounded media ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] ) , its wave vector is : @xmath5 surface plasmon is a @xmath6 wave .",
    "the ratio of the longitudinal and the transverse field components is @xmath7 in the dielectric medium , and @xmath8 in the metal .      because of the limited penetration of the surface plasmon wave into a dielectric medium , it is widely used in monitoring the refractive index of thin dielectric layers .",
    "the most widely used kretschmann excitation geometry includes a high - refractive - index prism , a thin metal film , and a dielectric medium in contact with the this film ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prism ] ) .",
    "the reflectivity as a function of the incident angle ( or wavelength ) exhibits a sharp minimum at a certain angle @xmath9 corresponding to the surface plasmon excitation @xcite . by measuring the resonant angle / wavelength",
    ", one can determine the refractive index of the dielectric medium with high accuracy .",
    "the sensitivity of this technique is limited by the angular width of the surface plasmon resonance , @xmath10 .",
    "next , we will develop compact expressions for the spr angle and width , @xmath11    the resonance condition is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the refractive index and @xmath14 is the wave vector in the prism .",
    "equations [ k - x],[excitation ] yield the resonant angle @xmath15 this angle always exceeds the critical angle @xmath16 to recast these expressions using an external angle ( see fig . [",
    "fig : prism ] ) , we apply snell s law and obtain : @xmath17 where s @xmath18 is the angle at the base of the prism ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prism ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : example ] compares the spr in the visible ( @xmath190.633 @xmath20 m ) and in the infrared ( @xmath191.4 @xmath20 m ) range .",
    "the spr appears as a pronounced reflectivity dip . in the visible range , this dip is wide and appears well above the critical angle , whereas in the infrared range , this dip is very narrow and is very close to the critical angle .",
    "the depth of the surface plasmon resonance in kretschmann geometry is fine - tuned by the careful choice of the metal film thickness , @xmath21 .",
    "note that the surface plasmon propagating along a thin metal film is not a true surface wave but rather a leaky wave that radiates a considerable part of its energy back into the prism @xcite .",
    "for the optimal metal film thickness , the reflectivity at the resonant angle achieves its minimum value and approaches zero ( the so - called critical coupling regime ) , whereas radiation losses are equal to intrinsic losses ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the radiation affects the surface plasmon dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ k - x ] ) as well .",
    "the resonant angle ( eq . [ theta - sp ] ) is slightly shifted by 1 - 1.5@xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 is changed more significantly : in the critical coupling regime it increases by a factor of two with respect to that given by eq .",
    "[ k - x ] @xcite .",
    "since we focus on the biological applications of the surface plasmon resonance , we will next consider only water - based samples .",
    "we will assume that the metal film is composed of gold and that its thickness is optimal , i.e. , it corresponds to the critical coupling regime .",
    "since the dielectric constant of gold at infrared frequencies is very high , @xmath25 , losses are small , @xmath26 . if the dielectric losses are also small , then @xmath27 , then @xmath28 . under these conditions ,",
    "we obtain useful expressions for the real and imaginary parts of the surface plasmon wave vector propagating along the gold film with optimal thickness : @xmath29 ( note that @xmath4 . ) the surface plasmon penetration depth into the dielectric is @xmath30 the surface plasmon propagation length along the metal - dielectric interface is @xcite @xmath31 since the dielectric constant of the metal in the infrared range is very high , @xmath32 , then @xmath33 ( this is valid even if the loss tangent of the metal is high , @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , the conductor loss contribution to @xmath35 is negligible and it is determined mainly by the dielectric loss .    to estimate the surface plasmon resonance width , @xmath10",
    ", we noted that eq .",
    "[ excitation ] yields @xmath36 .",
    "we replaced @xmath37 by @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a numerical constant that depends on how the spr width is defined ( fwhm or differently ) .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ external],[width ] , we obtain @xmath40 for realistic parameters of the prism and the sample ( @xmath41 ) , the angular dependence of the prefactor , @xmath42 , is very weak and it can be replaced by a numerical constant . using eq .",
    "[ k - x  ] , we recast eq .",
    "[ width - ext ] as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 absorbs all numerical constants . a comparison of the exact numerical calculations for the zns prism and water as a dielectric medium yields @xmath45 .",
    "an approximate expression for the spr width is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the incident beam divergence . although the spr width can be calculated exactly using fresnel reflectivity formulae , eqs .",
    "[ width - ext1],[divergence ] are more amenable to analysis .",
    "the spr width is a crucial factor that determines the sensitivity of the spr technique .",
    "the latter is usually @xcite defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the reflectivity and @xmath50 . after recasting this expression using an angular variable ,",
    "we obtain @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum sensitivity is achieved at some angle that corresponds to the sloping edge of the surface plasmon resonance , where reflectivity sharply drops from unity to almost zero .",
    "hence @xmath52 the first factor here is determined by the spr width ( eqs . [ width - ext],[divergence ] ) , whereas the second factor , @xmath53 , is a smooth function of the refractive index that is derived from eqs .",
    "[ theta - sp],[external ] .    to characterize thin dielectric layers with a thickness smaller than the surface plasmon penetration depth @xmath54 ( eq . [ delta - z ] , the spr sensitivity is defined as follows @xcite , @xmath55",
    "we will now consider practical aspects of the infrared surface plasmon resonance in the biological , i.e. , water - based samples .",
    "although spr at infrared frequencies can be excited in many metals @xcite , the requirement of biocompatibility leaves gold as the only choice . for the near ir , one can use bk-7 or sf-11 glass prisms , whereas for mid - ir , one can use zns or znse prisms .",
    "the range of wavelengths / angles where spr can be excited is determined by the dielectric losses in water and by the conductive losses in the gold film .",
    "figure [ fig : water ] shows dielectric losses ( upper panel ) and the refractive index of water ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is clear that spr at the au / water interface can be excited only in several `` allowed '' spectral windows where water absorption is sufficiently low .",
    "figure [ fig : water ] shows the spr angle vs. the wavelength , as predicted by eqs . [ theta - sp],[external ] ( lower panel , right @xmath56-axis ) .",

    "the surface plasmon resonance is overdamped and the surface plasmon wave quickly attenuates , yielding @xmath60 .    in the context of sensing biological cell cultures , it is useful to compare the surface plasmon propagation length , @xmath35 , to the lateral size of the cell , @xmath61 @xmath20 m . in the spectral ranges @xmath62 @xmath20 m and @xmath63 m , the surface plasmon propagation length is small , @xmath64 , and reflectivity in the spr regime is the sum of the contributions of individual cells . in the spectral ranges @xmath65 @xmath20",

    "however , a small penetration depth precludes studying the cell interior . in the spectral range @xmath69 @xmath20 m , the surface plasmon penetration depth is @xmath70 @xmath20 m .",
    "hence , the surface plasmon wave penetrates deep enough to study events in the cell cytoplasm but not in the nucleus . for the wavelength range",
    "@xmath71 @xmath20 m , the penetration depth is comparable to the cell size ; hence , the whole cell volume is accessible for the surface plasmon .",
    "figure [ fig : width ] shows the spr width vs. wavelength , as given by eqs .",
    "[ width - ext1],[divergence ] .",
    "the exact calculation , using fresnel reflectivity formulae , yields almost the same results . note that in the near - infrared range ( @xmath72 @xmath20 m ) , where water optical absorption is negligible , the spr width is determined by conductor losses . on the other hand , at @xmath73 @xmath20 m",

    "@xmath21 decreases with increasing wavelength , in such a way that the operation in mid - ir requires 10 - 12-nm - thick gold films ; this approaches the practical limit at which continuous gold films can be fabricated .",

    "we consider several regimes in which the ftir - spr technique can be used to study biological objects .",
    "these objects ( cell membrane , single cell , cell culture , etc . ) have different sizes and the surface plasmon propagation there is also different .",
    "indeed , the sp propagation depends on the relation between the spatial extent of the sp wave and the characteristic size of the sample .",

    "next , we will present several biological applications of the ftir - spr technique .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows our experimental setup based on the bruker equinox 55 ftir spectrometer .",
    "the light source is a tungsten lamp equipped with the kbr beam splitter .",
    "the infrared beam is emitted from the external port of the spectrometer and passes through a collimator consisting of a pinhole mounted at the common focal plane of two au - coated off - axis parabolic mirrors with a focal length of 76.2 mm and 25.4 mm , correspondingly . for the 1-mm - diameter pinhole ,",
    "the beam diameter is 3 - 4 mm and the beam divergence is @xmath80 .",
    "the collimated beam passes through the grid polarizer ( specac , ltd . ) and is reflected from the right - angle zns prism ( isp optics , inc . ) mounted on a @xmath81 rotating table .",
    "another parabolic mirror focuses the reflected beam on the liquid - nitrogen - cooled mct ( hgcdte ) detector .",
    "a temperature - stabilized flow chamber ( with a volume of 0.5 ml ) is in contact with the gold - coated base of the prism .",
    "the gold film thickness is chosen according to the targeted wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : width ] , inset ) .    to operate this setup , we first choose the desired incident angle .",
    "then we mount the sample and measure the reflectivity spectrum for the @xmath82-polarized beam .",
    "this spectrum is used as a background for further measurements .",
    "then we measure the reflectivity spectrum for the @xmath83-polarized beam .",
    "normally , this is done with 4- @xmath84 resolution and 16 scan averaging .",
    "we used the ftir - spr technique for precisely measuring the refractive index of solutions .",
    "our motivation was to monitor physiologically important glucose concentrations in water and in human plasma @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been performed earlier using spr in the visible range @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : glucose ] shows the reflectivity spectra of pure water and of 1@xmath85 d - glucose solution measured using our setup .",
    "the spectral range around 4000 @xmath84 corresponds to the short - wavelength spr , and the small peak at 2000 @xmath84 corresponds to the long - wavelength spr . adding glucose affects the whole reflectivity spectrum , in such a way that the spr resonance is red  shifted .",
    "the maximal reflectivity change occurs at 4600 @xmath84 .",
    "the inset shows that the reflectivity at @xmath86 linearly increases with increasing glucose concentration .",
    "the slope of this linear dependence yields sensitivity , @xmath87 riu@xmath88 .",
    "taking into account the actual beam divergence of 0.8@xmath23 , the experimental sensitivity is consistent with the approximate expression given by eq .",
    "[ s - bulk ] ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : sens - bulk ] ) .",
    "here we studied glucose uptake by erythrocyte suspension in the pbs medium @xcite .",
    "briefly , fresh human red blood cells ( rbcs ) were washed four times in pbs by centrifugation .",
    "the supernatant and buffy coat cells were discarded and rbcs were resuspended in glucose - free pbs to yield @xmath89 v / v . for complete glucose depletion",
    ", cells were incubated for 60 min at 22@xmath23 c in pbs . then",
    ", rbcs were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh pbs containing the required concentrations of d - glucose supplemented with l - glucose , to keep the total glucose concentration ( osmolarity ) equal to 20 mm .",
    "the spr measurements were performed at 22@xmath23c to slow down cellular glycolysis .",
    "our measurements were performed using a zns prism coated with a 12-nm thick au film .",
    "we chose the wavelength @xmath194 @xmath20 m at which the surface plasmon penetration depth , @xmath904.5 @xmath20 m ( fig . [ fig : penetration - depth ] ) , is comparable to the typical erythrocyte diameter .",
    "although the sensitivity at this wavelength is low ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sens - bulk ] ) , the use of such a long wavelength here is mandatory in order to sense the processes inside erythrocytes .",
    "the average distance between the erythrocytes is @xmath9117 @xmath20 m .",
    "the surface plasmon propagation length , @xmath9230 @xmath20 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propagation - length ] ) , exceeds the distance between erythrocytes .",
    "hence , in the `` coherence area '' of the surface plasmon wave , ( @xmath93 ) , there are 1 - 2 erythrocytes .",
    "the erythrocytes intensively absorb d - glucose , which affects their refraction index and probably their shape .",
    "the optical reflectivity from the erythrocyte suspension changes correspondingly .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : erythro ] shows that , upon addition of d - glucose , reflectivity in the spr regime rapidly increases with time , until saturation occurs .",
    "the rate of this process increases when cells are exposed to higher glucose concentrations .    in another experiment",
    ", cells were exposed to a solution containing 20 mm d - glucose supplemented with 20 @xmath20 m of the glut-1 inhibitor , cytochalasin b ( cb ) .",
    "a negligible reflectivity change was observed in the presence of the inhibitor .",
    "similarly , minor changes in the reflectivity were detected when cells were exposed to a plain buffer solution .",
    "we interpret these results as follows : the erythrocytes absorb d - glucose ( but not l - glucose ) , and this affects their refraction index . although the exact mechanism by which the surface plasmon wave interacts with the erythrocytes is not yet clear , we believe that the observed spr variation is associated with d - glucose uptake by erythrocytes because ( i ) the rate of spr change is determined by the glucose concentration and ( ii ) the spr change is inhibited by cytochalasin b , as expected .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that ftir - spr measurements specifically sense a glucose - dependent transport process .",
    "this conjecture is corroborated by the dielectric spectroscopy measurements on similar suspensions @xcite .",
    "we succeeded in growing cell cultures directly on the au - coated prism @xcite .",
    "these include human melanoma ( mel 1106 ) , mdck , and hela cells that form monolayers with a typical confluence of 60 - 80@xmath85 . in a typical experiment ,",

    "the temperature in the flow chamber was controlled within 0.1@xmath23c while the buffer solution was constantly pushed through the chamber at a flow rate of 5 @xmath20l / min using a motorized bee syringe pump .",
    "after 5 - 7 minutes of equilibration , we measured the reflectivity in the spr regime .",
    "the measurements lasted up to 6 hours , after which , the cells usually die , most probably from the lack of co@xmath94 .",
    "understanding surface plasmon propagation in the cell monolayer necessitates further discussion .",
    "indeed , the cells have irregular shapes with a lateral size of @xmath95 @xmath20m@xmath96 and a height of 1 to 6 @xmath20 m . since the cells contain up to 25@xmath85 organic molecules",
    ", their average refractive index exceeds that of water .",
    "this results in an angular shift of the spr resonance ( eq . [ theta - sp ] ) for the zns / au / cell interface , compared with the zns / au / water interface .",
    "however , even at high cell confluence , some parts of the au - coated prism are still uncovered by cells .",
    "these au patches may exhibit an unshifted spr , provided their size exceeds the sp propagation length , @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ fig : hela ] summarizes our studies of the hela cell monolayers grown on an sf-11 gold - coated glass prism .",

    "the corresponding penetration depth is also small , @xmath900.7 @xmath20 m ( fig .",

    "figure [ fig : hela ] shows angular - dependent reflectivity for different cell coverages ( confluences ) . in the absence of cells , there is a single dip at @xmath98 53.4@xmath23 that corresponds to the surface plasmon resonance at the zns / au / water interface . in the presence of hela cells",

    "was mounted into a flow chamber and was equilibrated in growth medium for 5 - 7 minutes at 37@xmath23 c. then we added 10 mm of m@xmath114cd - chol ( methyl - beta - cyclodextrin loaded with cholesterol ) , which is known to enrich the cells by cholesterol .",
    "we measured ftir - spr spectra before and after adding the drugs .",
    "figure [ fig : cholesterol ] shows that after exposure to m@xmath114cd - chol , the spr is red - shifted .",

    "interestingly , the spr here is blue - shifted , indicating that the average refractive index in the measured volume decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : holo ] , inset ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the spr shift results from accumulation of organic molecules in the cell ( this would increase the refractive index ) .",
    "the blue shift indicates that the cells become `` diluted '' , as if the growth solution penetrates into cells .",
    "this is consistent with the biological picture of endocytosis that includes transferrin - induced vesicular transport .",
    "* in the context of biosensing , the lack of convenient laser sources and of enhanced water absorption were considered as major impediments for extending the surface plasmon resonance technique into the mid - ir range .",
    "we demonstrated here that there are several spectral windows , whereby clever choice of wavelength , beam collimation , angle of incidence , and metal film thickness , the spr technique can achieve sensitivity that is comparable and even higher than that in the visible range .",
    "* surface plasmon resonance in mid - ir can be used to study cells and cell cultures .",
    "this technique is well matched for the sensing of cells since the surface plasmon penetration depth in the infrared range is just on the order of the cell size .",
    "this is in contrast to the surface plasmon in the visible range , whose penetration depth is too short to probe the processes inside the cell cytoplasm .",
    "however , to develop the ftir - spr technique into a useful tool for studying cells , one must theoretically analyze surface plasmon propagation and scattering in a cell monolayer .",
    "* the waveguide modes in cell culture may develop into a useful tool to study cell - cell attachment and cell adhesion to substrates .",
    "* the most challenging task in the field of ftir - spr is to convert it into a spectroscopic tool that allows measuring the ftir absorption / dispersion spectra in the regime of the surface plasmon resonance .",
    "the sensitivity of this technique should surpass that of ftir - atr @xcite and allow detection of biomolecules according to their `` fingerprints '' .",
    "we are grateful to s. shimron for preparing the cell cultures and for significantly contributing to the spr experiments associated with them , to l. livshitz for his help in erythrocyte studies , as well as to n. melamed - book and a. m. weiss for confocal microscope images and processing .",
