    "the abundance of galaxy clusters provides a very direct way to estimate @xmath1 , the linear theory @xmath14 density fluctuations in comoving spheres of @xmath15 , extrapolated to redshift zero ( peebles , daly & juszkiewicz 1989 ; frenk 1990 ; white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; ikebe 2002 ; pierpaoli 2003 ; schuecker 2003 ; henry 2004 ) .",
    "this parameter sets the normalisation of the matter power spectrum .",
    "as the cluster abundance varies rapidly with @xmath1 , the main difficulty in this method is not the determination of the abundance , but knowing the mass of the objects under consideration .",
    "the current @xmath16 per cent uncertainty on the value of @xmath1 ( see viana 2003 and henry 2004 for recent discussions of cluster - based estimates ) brackets important differences in the formation histories of dark matter haloes .",
    "this has implications for a broad range of topics , such as the redshift at which gravitationally bound structures first form , the merger histories of galaxy - sized haloes and the concentration of the dark matter density profile within haloes .",
    "many of the cluster samples used so far to determine @xmath1 have been based on the rosat x - ray all sky survey .",
    "it is clearly desirable to supplement these estimates with others derived from independent cluster samples , where the clusters are found using different techniques .",
    "there are already a number of studies that have estimated the galaxy cluster mass function using catalogues of optically selected objects ( bahcall & cen 1993 ; biviano 1993 ; girardi 1998 ; martnez 2002 ; bahcall 2003 ) . in this study , the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group ( 2pigg ) catalogue ( eke 2004a ) is used , in conjunction with mock galaxy catalogues , to provide a new estimate of the mass function .",
    "the use of mock catalogues extends the previous work by quantifying some of the systematic biases inherent in the method .",
    "the group luminosity function , that is the abundance of groups as a function of their total luminosity , has previously been determined using galaxy redshift survey data by moore , frenk & white ( 1993 ) , marinoni , hudson & giuricin ( 2002 ) and martnez ( 2002 ) .",
    "the 2pigg catalogue increases the number of available groups by a factor of approximately two relative to the work of martnez ( 2002 ) , who used the earlier data release from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the group luminosity function provides an indirect way to measure the mass function if one knows how to relate mass to luminosity .",
    "for instance , if the statistical uncertainties on the cluster dynamical mass estimates are significantly larger than those on the cluster luminosities , then the combination of the group luminosity function with a typical cluster mass - to - light ratio will yield a more accurate estimation of the cluster mass function than would be found from directly using the dynamical masses . turning this around ,",
    "given a theoretical mass function and a measured group luminosity function , one can infer the mapping from mass to luminosity as a function of group size ( marinoni & hudson 2002 ) .",
    "this picks out the group scales at which mass is most efficiently turned into starlight and , as such , encodes important clues about the process of galaxy formation ( benson 2000 ; van den bosch , yang & mo 2003 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "mock galaxy catalogues , constructed from n - body simulations of the @xmath17cdm cosmology combined with a semi - analytical model for placing galaxies into dark matter haloes , are used to estimate how group - finding in the 2dfgrs leads to biases in the recovered cluster mass and group luminosity functions .",
    "then the 2pigg catalogue is used to estimate the cluster mass and group luminosity functions , and the mass - to - light ratio for groups .",
    "this final quantity is inferred under the assumption that the group mass function is given by the fit to the halo mass function measured in n - body simulations , as described by jenkins ( 2001 , j01 ) . given the typical halo mass , or equivalently circular speed , at a given luminosity , one can compare these results with the observed tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ; bell & de jong 2001 ) . under the assumption that observed tully - fisher galaxies lie in typical haloes , this determines the conversion from observed rotation speeds of galaxies to halo circular velocities .",
    "this result has some bearing on the long - running debate concerning the ability of galaxy formation models to match the galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation simultaneously ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole 1994 ; heyl 1995 ) .",

    "section  [ sec : lf ] contains the group luminosity function results , which are applied to determining the group mass - to - light ratio variation in section  [ sec : mol ] . in section  [ sec : tf ] , the halo mass - to - light ratios are compared with the observed tully - fisher relation .",
    "the construction of the 2pigg catalogue is described in detail by eke ( 2004a ) .",
    "this paper also discusses the generation of mock galaxy catalogues from a combination of dark matter n - body simulations and semi - analytical galaxy formation models .",
    "the catalogue has been constructed from the two contiguous patches in the 2dfgrs ( colless 2001 ) , which contain a total of @xmath18 galaxies . of these",

    "both the semi - analytical models of cole ( 2000 ) and benson ( 2003 ) have been used to place galaxies into the dark matter distributions in the two simulation cubes .",

    "the stripes traced out by the points are a result of the distinct flux limits in different patches of the survey .    in all of what follows",
    ", the group sample will be restricted to the @xmath40 objects , because at higher redshifts , less than half of the total group luminosity is contained in visible galaxies and the correction for this missing light becomes too uncertain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : correctl ] ) . for the same reason",
    ", the volume at @xmath41 will also be excised .",
    "when calculating the abundance of groups , it is necessary to know the volume surveyed .",

    "if a group is defined to comprise at least @xmath43 galaxies , then the group @xmath42 could be approximated by the @xmath42 of the @xmath43th most luminous galaxy in that group .",
    "this takes into account the variable sky coverage as a function of flux in the 2dfgrs .",
    "however , for @xmath44 , this ignores the possibility that the set of galaxies linked together by the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm may not remain grouped at different redshifts , when the linking volume has changed in size and the set of galaxies satisfying the flux limits of the survey may have changed to the extent that parts of the group are no longer joined . to deal with these issues exactly",
    "would be awkward .",
    "these complications are minor though , because the linking volume changes with redshift to take into account the varying sampling of the galaxy distribution .",
    "consequently , the @xmath42 of the @xmath43th most luminous galaxy is used to define the group @xmath42 throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the mock catalogues can be used to gauge the extent to which this choice biases the results .",
    "of course , for the group luminosity function , @xmath45 can be used , in which case the @xmath42 value is correct .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the accuracy with which dynamical masses can be estimated varies rapidly with the number of galaxies sampling the group potential ( see figure 3 of eke 2004b ) .",
    "errors in estimated masses coupled with the steep decline in the abundance of clusters , groups with masses above @xmath46 , as a function of increasing mass , lead to systematic biases in the inferred abundance of clusters .",
    "this happens because more low - mass objects are scattered to higher masses than are scattered down from those higher masses .",
    "consequently , the abundance of high mass galaxy clusters will be systematically overestimated as a result of the uncertainties in measuring the individual cluster masses .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfbias ] for the mock catalogues , which compares the mass functions recovered from groups samples of different @xmath47 at @xmath48 in the mocks with the mass function of dark matter haloes in the simulation cube .",

    "error bars represent the standard deviation among the results from @xmath50 different mock catalogues made using the hubble volume simulation ( evrard 2002 ) .",
    "norberg ( 2002 ) provide a detailed description of how the mock catalogues are constructed .",
    "hawkins ( 2003 ) have shown that the galaxies in mock catalogues made from the hubble volume simulation cluster like those in the 2dfgrs , suggesting that the use of these mocks is appropriate . cosmic variance only increases the statistical errors by @xmath16 per cent relative to the @xmath51-weighted poisson errors .",
    "note that restricting the sample to include only groups containing large numbers of galaxies introduces incompleteness at lower masses , which , to some extent , counteracts the overestimation of the mass function due to mass measurement errors .",
    "nevertheless , as fig .",
    "[ fig : mfbias ] shows , the abundance is still overestimated by a factor of @xmath52 for @xmath53 . for the remainder of this section , @xmath54 and @xmath55 will be used .",
    "these cuts restrict the sample to @xmath56 clusters .",
    "the dynamically - inferred group masses show more scatter about the true halo mass in the simulations than masses inferred using the total group luminosity and a typical mass - to - light ratio ( eke 2004b ) .",
    "thus , one can produce a more robust estimate of the cluster mass function by using the cluster total luminosity function and a typical mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this is shown , at least for the highest masses , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfbias2 ] .",
    "the median mass - to - light ratio for all mock groups with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) has been used as a global shift to the cluster luminosity function to infer the mass function ( dotted line ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio varies little for these most massive objects ( eke 2004b ) , so this simple shift is appropriate .",
    "also shown is the j01 fitting formula for the mass function that describes the population of haloes from which the model curve is sampled . hereafter in this paper , only recovered mass functions obtained using the cluster luminosity function and the cluster mass - to - light ratio , as shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfbias2 ] , will be considered .    in order to place constraints upon the normalisation of the power spectrum ,",
    "it is necessary firstly to model the bias in recovering the mass function and secondly to compare the measured mass function in the 2pigg catalogue with the biased models for each value of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : mfbias3 ] shows the j01 mass functions for two different values of @xmath1 , before and after applying a shift to account for the measurement errors .",
    "an approximation to the bias introduced by measuring the mass function is to translate the j01 curves to the right by @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "these shifts provide the best @xmath61 fits ( assuming weighted poisson errors ) to the mass functions measured from the mock group catalogues for both values of @xmath1 . the uncertainty on the size of these translations , judging by the change in @xmath61 of the resulting fits , is @xmath62 per cent in mass for the cole ( 2000 ) mocks .",
    "the shifts required for the mocks made using the benson ( 2003 ) semi - analytical procedure differ by @xmath63 per cent from the cole ( 2000 ) mocks .",
    "thus , one should consider these corrections to be uncertain by @xmath16 per cent in mass .",
    "with these shifts , each model curve can be converted into a mass function in measurement space .",
    "note how the measurement bias is larger for the lower value of @xmath1 , where the clusters are more difficult to detect because of the lower contrast .",
    "this , unfortunately , reduces the power of the test , but it is nevertheless apparent that these two different values of @xmath1 can still be distinguished .",

    "error bars again are the @xmath51-weighted poisson errors .",
    "this neglects the @xmath16 per cent additional contribution from cosmic variance , which is minor relative to the systematic uncertainties inherent in this method .    by assuming that the convolving function generates a mean shift that varies linearly with @xmath1 and not at all with @xmath2",

    "using values of @xmath75 or @xmath76 changes the value of @xmath1 by less than @xmath77 per cent for @xmath22 . while the statistical uncertainty upon the estimate of @xmath78 is small ( @xmath16 per cent ) , the systematic correction that has been applied to account for the measurement bias is substantially bigger ( @xmath9 per cent ) .",
    "it is worthwhile reiterating that the probability contours involve extrapolating the noisy fits of convolving functions to the mock recovered mass functions , so this systematic shift is quite rough .",

    "errors on the various curves are usually of the order of @xmath80 per cent .",
    "some of the variation from one study to another will come from assuming different power spectrum shapes ( @xmath81 ) , but this dependence is quite weak ( seljak 2002 ; rhodes 2004 ) so the excess scatter between the curves is a sign of other systematic effects . for the cluster abundance - based measurements , the main source of systematic differences comes due to the choice of the mass - observable relation ( see henry 2004 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the total @xmath10-band group luminosity function is a distribution that , unlike the galaxy luminosity function , can readily be compared with theoretical dark matter halo mass functions . in section  [ sec : mol ] the group luminosity function will be used in conjunction with theoretical mass functions to derive halo mass - to - light ratios .",
    "[ fig : dlf1 ] shows how well the @xmath10-band group luminosity function can be recovered from a mock catalogue . only the groups with @xmath82 are included in the calculation of these curves .",
    "as the upper limit in redshift is increased , the typical correction for luminosity in galaxies fainter than the flux limit increases .",
    "consequently , the recovered luminosity functions become increasingly biased high . on the other hand ,",
    "if the maximum redshift is too restrictive , then there are insufficient clusters , and the volume probed may no longer be representative of the universe as a whole .",
    "the choice of @xmath83 is a compromise between these two competing factors .",

    "the 2dfggc results lie lower , because of the requirement that their groups contain at least @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "the 2pigg group luminosity function also lies somewhat above those of moore and marinoni et al .",

    "this should make these curves directly comparable with the other results in the @xmath10 band .",
    "both the moore and marinoni studies probe smaller volumes than in the 2pigg case , so cosmic variance may be partly responsible for the lower abundance of @xmath94 groups found in these earlier studies .",

    "it is worth noting that the mass - to - light ratio as a function of group luminosity obtained by matching abundances is not the same as the median mass - to - light ratio of groups in each particular luminosity bin .",

    "after all , the model mass function has been assumed to be appropriate for the real universe , and the galaxy luminosity function in the model has been scaled so as to match that of the 2dfgrs . the only possibility for the corrected 2pigg results to differ from the model in fig .",
    "[ fig : molmh3 ] is if the group luminosity functions differ , despite the identical global galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "thus , the measurement of an increase in 2pigg mass - to - light ratio as group size decreases from @xmath107 is , if not inevitable , to be expected merely from the fact that the faint end slope of the galaxy luminosity function is flatter than that of the @xmath17cdm mass function at low masses .",
    "the extra information available here comes from the fact that the group luminosity function is tracing the same structures probed with the mass function measurements .",
    "consequently , the normalisation of the mass - to - light ratio is not predetermined but , in fact , recovered in addition to the variation with group size .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : molmh3 ] show how the typical halo mass varies with halo luminosity . for a particular definition of a halo , one can convert this to a relation between the halo circular speed and the halo luminosity via @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the mean enclosed density of the halo , taken to be @xmath113 times the critical value .",
    "( note that this value is not exact because the identification of the groups is done using a fof algorithm , rather than growing a sphere out to a particular density contrast . )",
    "this relation is reminiscent of the tully - fisher relation between galaxy luminosity and rotation speed at the edge of the visible galaxy . for low luminosity systems",
    ", a central bright galaxy usually dominates the total group luminosity , so the galaxy and group luminosities are likely to be quite similar .",
    "[ fig : tf2 ] shows the median ratio of the brightest galaxy to total group luminosity , as a function of total group luminosity .",
    "the mock and 2pigg curves are very similar , with the main difference being that the brightest galaxy in the bigger mock groups typically contains a slightly higher fraction of the total group luminosity than in the 2piggs .    if one were to apply the median shift of fig .",
    "[ fig : tf2 ] to convert the group luminosity to the typical luminosity of the brightest contained galaxy , then equation  ( [ tf ] ) could relate galaxy luminosity to halo circular speed at the virial radius .",
    "then , one might reasonably ask , given the tully - fisher relation and the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : molmh3 ] , what is the relationship between the galaxy rotation speed and the halo circular speed for galaxies with @xmath114 ?",
    "the answer to this question is contained in fig .  [",
    "fig : tf ] .",
    "the @xmath92-band tully - fisher relation of bell & de jong ( 2001 ) has been converted to @xmath115 , and is shown with a dotted line .",
    "note that these authors advocate the use of @xmath116 to characterise the velocity derived from the galaxy rotation curve .",
    "the dashed curve shows the halo circular velocity from equation  ( [ tf ] ) as a function of luminosity ( ie the group luminosity multiplied by the factor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf2 ] to convert it to a galaxy luminosity ) .",
    "a solid line traces the ratio of @xmath117 to @xmath118 . how should this figure be interpreted ? if one considers a galaxy with @xmath119 , then the tully - fisher relation of bell & de jong gives @xmath120 , whereas the abundance matching method implies that it typically lives in a halo with circular speed @xmath121 . for less luminous galaxies ,",
    "these two velocities become more similar , so that the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve corresponds to a speed that is approximately the same as the circular velocity of the host halo .",
    "the suggestion that the galaxy rotation speed is similar to the halo circular velocity is broadly in accord with the results for the @xmath122-band tully - fisher relation in the semi - analytical galaxy formation models of cole ( 2000 ) and croton 2005 .",
    "they found that the galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation could be matched simultaneously when the galaxy rotation speed was assumed to equal the halo circular velocity .",
    "however , one would expect as baryons concentrate in the centres of galaxy - sized potential wells , they would drag in dark matter , leading to galaxy rotation speeds that are a few tens of per cent larger than the halo circular velocity . in this case , the tully - fisher relation is no longer reproduced by the model .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn from hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation by navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) and eke , navarro & steinmetz ( 2001 ) , and also from the analysis of de jong ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is possible that the comparison above could be misleading ; perhaps the galaxies included in tully - fisher samples are atypical .",
    "if the observed set of galaxies lie in either unusually luminous or unusually low concentration haloes , then this might reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the low observed rotation speeds and the higher expected values .",
    "for example , the semi - analytical model behind the mock catalogues used in this work predicts that the distribution of masses of haloes with @xmath123 has a @xmath124 scatter that equates to @xmath9 per cent in halo circular speed .",
    "if , for some reason , the galaxies selected in the tully - fisher measurements lie in the less massive haloes at that particular luminosity , then this could have a very significant impact in reducing the dark matter contribution to the observed rotation curves .",
    "similarly , if typical tully - fisher galaxies happen to lie in atypically unconcentrated haloes , then the dark matter contribution to the observed rotation curves would again be reduced .",
    "the 2pigg catalogue has been used to measure the mass and luminosity functions of groups and clusters . by combining the measured abundance of clusters as a function of luminosity , with a typical mass - to - light ratio , the cluster mass function",
    "is measured more accurately than by using the dynamically - inferred masses directly . after removing a bias due to measurement errors in the abundance , using that found in mock catalogues constructed from @xmath17cdm n - body simulations",
    ", the 2pigg mass function implies that @xmath125 for @xmath5 . while the statistical uncertainty on this value is around @xmath126 per cent , the systematic correction that has been applied is closer to @xmath127 per cent .",
    "the uncertainty in this correction , coupled with the systematic uncertainty in the normalisation of the estimated cluster masses ( the value of @xmath79 in equation  [ mass ] ) , currently limits the precision of this determination of @xmath1 to @xmath9 per cent . to decrease this uncertainty significantly",
    "would require a more detailed understanding of how the observed galaxies populate the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "the group luminosity function is in good agreement with previous studies for groups with total @xmath10-band luminosity exceeding @xmath128 . at lower luminosities ,",
    "the abundance of 2piggs is somewhat larger than has previously been found from smaller samples .",
    "matching this abundance to that of haloes of a given mass in @xmath17cdm simulations gives the mass - to - light ratio as a function of group size .",
    "this indirect method combined with the direct estimates of eke ( 2004b ) at higher luminosities allows the recovery of the variation of the group mass - to - light ratio over almost four orders of magnitude in group luminosity .",
    "the resulting function has a minimum value of @xmath129 at group luminosity @xmath130 . finally , the group mass - to - light ratio was used to infer the halo circular speed as a function of group luminosity .",
    "comparison to the observed tully - fisher relation for galaxies suggests that , at a given galaxy luminosity , the observed rotation speed is similar to the typical halo circular speed .",
    "the dependence of the group mass - to - light ratio on group luminosity provides a key test of various feedback processes invoked in models of galaxy formation ( benson 2000 ; benson 2003 ; croton 2005 ) .",
    "the agreement between the indirect determination at low luminosities presented in this paper and the results of the semi - analytical @xmath17cdm model assumed in the construction of the mock catalogues is encouraging .",
    "a direct determination based , for example , on a deeper redshift survey is desirable .",
    "we would like to thank christian marinoni for his very helpful comments concerning different wavebands .",
