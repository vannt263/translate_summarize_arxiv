    "the concept of the resonance graph appears quite naturally in the study of perfect matchings of molecular graphs of hydrocabons that represent kekul ' e structures of corresponding hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that it has been independently introduced in the chemical @xcite as well as in the mathematical literature @xcite ( under the name @xmath3-transformation graph ) and then later rediscovered in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the zhang - zhang polynomial of the molecular graph and the cube polynomial of its resonance graph was established for benzenoid systems @xcite , tubulenes @xcite , and fullerenes @xcite . the zhang - zhang polynomial counts clar covers with given number of hexagons , i.e.conjugated 6-cycles .",
    "for some recent research on the zhang - zhang polynomial see @xcite the resonance energy is a theoretical quantity which is used for predicting the aromatic stability of conjugated systems . in the conjugated - circuit model ,",
    "the resonance energy is determined with conjugated cycles of different lengths ( see @xcite ) , not only with 6-cycles . among them , only 6-cycles and 10-cycles have uniquely determined structure . therefore , we introduce the concept of the generalized zhang - zhang polynomial , which considers both of them . in this paper",
