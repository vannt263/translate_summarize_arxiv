    "in general , a phase operator approach to one - dimensional fermions comprises several features :    * extending the linearized dispersion near the fermi energy with respect to fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 to all values of @xmath5 and adding an anomalous vacuum of filled negative energy states , kronig s identity @xcite can be used to transform the free hamiltonian into a free bosonic form involving phonon - like density fluctuation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
