    "this paper explores using standard wireless devices which measure only received signal strength ( rss ) to monitor and localize the breathing of a person , who does not wear any device , in a residential environment . in comparison ,",
    "existing breathing monitoring methods either require sensors in contact with the body , or require specialized and expensive radar devices @xcite .",
    "the core of the idea of non - contact breathing monitoring via rss is that some links rss values , on a particular channel , are highly sensitive to motion near the link line ( the line between transmitter and receiver ) , and that those links can be used , in the absence of other motion , to estimate the person s breathing rate , and in addition , to estimate that a breathing person is near that link line . from many links rss data , and from measurements on multiple frequency channels",
    ", we can estimate breathing rate and perform breathing localization .",
    "one of the core challenges is that these same links also experience rapid change due to other movement , for example , if a person s limb moves .",
    "our methods are robust to these normal occasional movements because it identifies when a sudden movement occurs , subtracts its effects out , and can still then estimate breathing rate in periods containing that motion .",
    "our work is the first , to our knowledge , to use rss measurements to locate where that breathing is occurring .",
    "a significant body of related research has shown that people moving people can be located in a building using a static wireless network that measures links rss values @xcite .",
    "this can be done through walls @xcite , using a variety of statistics of the measured rss .",
    "however , state - of - the - art rss - based non - cooperative localization methods require either : 1 ) _ motion _ , that is , a person to be moving at least once during the course of the time in which measurements are collected @xcite , or 2 ) _ empty - area calibration _ , measurements of the rss from the period of time when the area was cleared of any people @xcite . even systems sophisticated enough to adaptively learn to distinguish the statistics of rss during crossing vs.  no crossing require some periods of both to occur @xcite . in an search and rescue operation or a building fire , people may be unconscious and thus motionless by the time emergency responders arrive , and thus a non - cooperative user localization system may not be able to locate them . although some work on robotic rf sensor networks has demonstrated the ability to image concrete structures @xcite , work has not yet shown that a motionless person could be located without prior empty calibration . in this paper , we show a method that would locate a stationary but breathing person without an empty - area calibration , although we note that we do not test it through walls or in rubble .",
    "as another application , using standard wireless networks for contact - free breathing monitoring may be useful for health care and wellbeing .",
    "one may be able to use a wireless network deployed in a bedroom as a baby breathing monitor , or as part of an in - home sleep apnea diagnostic system .",
    "elder care systems which track and monitor an elderly person s location and activities for abnormal changes could use breathing rates as additional context information . as of",
    "yet , we have not developed algorithms to identify or distinguish the breathing rates of two people in the same room .",
    "however , in these applications , breathing monitoring is most critical when the person is alone , and thus no other person is present to notice their apnea or their stoppage of breathing .",
    "finally , in general , breathing rate provides a measure of a person s context , and context - aware computing systems could benefit .",
    "perhaps `` smart '' homes could also be `` empathetic '' and respond appropriately when your at - rest breathing rate is abnormally high .",
    "a scary movie could adapt to the viewer s measured level of stress .    in the area of contact - free breathing monitoring",
    ", most systems use specialized radars .",
    "doppler radar devices can be used @xcite , but slow and small breathing movements mean that the doppler shift is very low unless the center frequency is very high . as a result ,",
    "commercial doppler radar breathing monitoring products are expensive and out of reach for many applications . for example , the kai medical `` continuous '' system @xcite , although not yet fda approved , is said to be priced at $ 2000 .",
    "ultra wideband impulse radars can estimate breathing as well as heart rate @xcite .",
    "radar propagation losses are of order @xmath1 in free space @xcite , as opposed to @xmath2 for transmission @xcite , and thus radar devices either have limited range or high transmit power . regarding the latter ,",
    "uwb devices are severely limited in transmit power by regulation , and thus compliant devices have a low range .",
    "we believe that use of a standard wireless network offers a low - cost alternative for residential breathing monitoring .",
    "our initial work was presented in @xcite , which introduced rss - based breathing monitoring , presenting algorithms for estimating breathing rate and detecting the absence of breathing .",
    "the methods were experimentally verified on a subject in a hospital bed , using transceivers placed within centimeters of the subject s body .",
    "the report shows that links in a deep fade are the ones most likely to measure changes when the person breathes .",
    "our breathing rate estimator is compared to the method of @xcite in section [ s : monitoring ] .",
    "this paper makes several advancements :    1 .",
    "this paper is the first to demonstrate that breathing can be monitored using wireless networking devices meters , as opposed to centimeters , away from the person .",
    "in addition , we use measurements on multiple frequency channels , and quantify the improvement possible compared to single - channel rss measurements in section [ s : numberofchannels ] . our testbed and experimental setups are described in section [ s : experiments ] .",
    "2 .   this paper presents an algorithm to estimate and avoid motion interference , and as a result , estimate breathing rate even during windows of time in which there is motion in the environment .",
    "the subject in @xcite was completely stationary , except for an expanding and contracting chest .",
    "when the person moves , for example , coughs , scratches an itch , moves an arm or leg , or changes position in bed , the method of @xcite becomes unable to estimate breathing rate for a period of time ( _ e.g. _ , 30 s ) .",
    "fundamentally , this is because the links most sensitive to chest motion are also those most sensitive to other motion .",
    "our method shows dramatic breathing rate estimation performance improvements . using 30 seconds of data , our method s breathing rate estimates have average error of 1.0 bpm , compared to 1.7 bpm for @xcite .",
    "our breathing rate estimation algorithm and experimental results are presented in section [ s : monitoring ] .",
    "third , the paper is the first to develop and test an algorithm to locate a breathing but otherwise stationary person . without any empty - room calibration or training period",
    ", we estimate an image map of breathing intensity in the deployment area , and locate the breathing from the highest point in the image .",
    "we see average localization errors of about 2 m. our localization algorithm and experimental results are presented in section [ s : localization ] .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss future research directions in section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the testbed network , the residential environment in which the tests are conducted , and the testing procedure .      in general , we suppose there is a network of @xmath3 transceiver nodes which can operate on one of @xmath4 frequency channels .",
    "link @xmath5 has transmitter ( tx ) @xmath6 , receiver ( rx ) @xmath7 , and frequency channel @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , each tx / rx / channel combination is a different logical link . in our experiments , @xmath9 because all links are connected , but full connectivity is not necessary for breathing monitoring .",
    "we assume that each link s rss is measured at regular intervals with period @xmath10 by sending and receiving a packet .",
    "note that newborns have the highest breathing rates , near 37 breaths per minute ( bpm ) , or 0.62 hz , and adults at rest breathe near 10 - 14 bpm , or 0.23 hz @xcite .",
    "to sample at the nyquist rate , sufficient for a newborn monitoring application , our sampling rate would need to be more than 1.24 hz .",
    "we denote the @xmath11th rss on link @xmath5 as @xmath12 $ ] , in db units .",
    "future work could extend the presented algorithms for irregularly sampled data .    in our experiments ,",
    "we use the ti cc2531 dongle node @xcite , an ieee 802.15.4 compliant radio .",
    "the cc2531 transmits with transmit power 4.5 dbm in the 2.4 ghz ism band , and can select from one of 16 frequency channels .",
    "a multi - channel tdma protocol is used in which each node transmits in sequence , and after all nodes slots , nodes switch synchronously to the next frequency channel @xcite .",
    "a node s packet transmission includes its node i d and the rss of the most recent packet received from each other node .",
    "a sink node that overhears all packets stores the data for post - processing .      in our first experiment ,",
    "the _ apartment experiment _",
    ", we deploy @xmath13 nodes , each at a height of 0.9 meters .",
    "our protocol uses @xmath14 , specifically , 802.15.4 channel numbers @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , selected to overlap the least with wifi .",
    "each link is measured each @xmath19 ms .",
    "this is a sampling rate of 2.3 hz .",
    "the testbed network is deployed in the apartment shown in figure [ f : apartmentmap ] .",
    "node locations are indicated with circles on the map .",
    "the apartment is on the third floor of a fully - occupied six story building in downtown salt lake city , utah .",
    "it is an actual person s residence , and is furnished , as can be seen from the photo of the living and kitchen areas in figure [ f : apartmentphoto ] .",
    "tests are conducted on a saturday between noon and 1:00 pm . during the tests ,",
    "other people are sometimes heard in the hallway outside of the apartment and in neighboring apartments .    as a large apartment building in a metropolitan area",
    ", there are many sources of 2.4 ghz interference .",
    "the apartment has its own wireless router , and more than ten strong wifi access points are observed , and although the channels are chosen to have the least overlap with wifi , they are not perfectly orthogonal .",
    "microwave ovens and cordless phones also exist in the nearby environment .",
    "* tests : * five tests are conducted . in each",
    ", the experimenter stays in a single location for 3 - 7 minutes and maintains maintains a constant breathing rate of 10 bpm using a metronome .",
    "the experimenter is instructed to sit or stand still at the location , but to move as required to be comfortable , _ i.e. _ , move an arm or leg or change position .",
    "the experimenter made some movement , on average , twice per minute .",
    "in the tests , the experimenter is located : ( 1 ) standing in the kitchen ; ( 2 ) sitting by the dining table ; ( 3 ) sitting on the sofa ; ( 4 ) laying in bed ; and ( 5 ) sitting on the toilet .      our second experiment , the _ nap experiment _ , is conducted in the master bedroom on the second floor of a house , as shown in figure [ f : map_nap_experiment ] .",
    "@xmath20 nodes are deployed in a 5.3 m by 5.3 m area , at power outlet locations or in power strips in the room .",
    "we placed two nodes per power outlet , one on the floor and the other at a height of about 0.48 - 1.65 m. the height of the high nodes varied because they are placed on top of furniture ( bedside table , dresser , table , etc . ) . in this experiment ,",
    "@xmath21 channels are measured , specifically , ieee 802.15.4 channels 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 and 26 . here",
    ", the sampling period was 179.6 ms , for a sampling rate of 5.56 hz .",
    "there is also wifi interference at this location , with one wireless router on the first floor below the bedroom .",
    "a laptop at location ( 2 m , 0.5 m ) records data and sends it over wifi to a server , ensuring some level of wifi interference to the breathing monitoring system .",
    "a single 66-minute long test is conducted .",
    "the experimenter starts collecting data on the laptop , walks to and climbs into the bed , and takes a nap .",
    "in contrast to the previous experiments , no ground truth is known for the experimenter s breathing rate , as no separate breathing monitoring sensor is attached to the person , and the person can not maintain a constant breathing rate while sleeping .",
    "after time 65 minutes , the person wakes up , gets out of bed and stops the data recording .",
    "the person moved at least once during sleep , since it was noted that he did not wake up in the same position that he went to sleep .",
    "in @xcite , an rss - based breathing rate estimator is proposed which , in short , calculates the power spectral density ( psd ) over each link using the most recent @xmath22 samples , sums the psd over @xmath23 links , and estimates the breathing rate as the frequency at the maximum of the sum psd .",
    "mathematically , @xmath24",
    "e^{-j 2\\pi f t n}\\right|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the minimum and maximum breathing rates which the system is set to allow , @xmath27 is the current time , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 $ ] is the change in rss compared to the mean , defined as @xmath30 = r_l[n ] - \\bar{r}_l,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the average rss on link @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath29 $ ] the _ rss signal _ because the mean rss carries no information about breathing , and in fact , a strong dc component overwhelms any other frequency contained in the data . in @xcite , dc removal",
    "is performed using a 7-tap iir filter . however , we find that setting @xmath32 $ ] , _ i.e. _ , the window average , has superior performance over a wide variety of experiments we have conducted .",
    "when comparing our method , to be fair to the spirit of the method in @xcite , we use this window average in ( [ e : meanremoval ] ) .",
    "the challenge faced by the rss - based breathing monitoring in general , and the basic method in particular , is that the links which best measure the person s chest movement are also those that best measure other motion in the environment .",
    "this other motion , which we term `` motion interference '' , can hide the breathing - induced changes . from our observation , motion interference and breathing cause notably different types of changes .",
    "while breathing causes slow , periodic rss changes , motion interference typically causes sudden changes .",
    "for example , a person who rolls over in bed , or moves a foot , causes fast rss changes during their movement .",
    "when the person stops moving , a link s rss typically settles to an average value different than before the movement .",
    "if such a shift occurs during the @xmath22-sample window , subtracting the mean as in ( [ e : meanremoval ] ) will not suffice to remove the strong low - frequency component in the rss signal .    instead , we propose to detect each time index during which a sudden rss change occurs .",
    "we call these detected time indices `` breakpoints '' . at each breakpoint",
    ", the system is allowed to forget the previous link rss averages and calculate new averages . by doing so , we are able to perform more accurate mean removal , and thus make breathing rate estimation more robust to motion interference .",
    "the t - test is an appropriate statistical detection test to perform this task .",
    "the t - test is a generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) of the change in mean between two groups of data @xcite , in our case , one group of rss signal samples prior to the time - under - test ( the sample index at which we want to detect a change in mean ) , and another same - duration group of data after the time - under - test .",
    "specifically , the group t - score is , @xmath33 = \\frac { \\grave{r}_l[n ] - \\acute{r}_l[n ] } { \\max\\left\\ { \\epsilon , \\sqrt { ( \\grave{\\sigma}^2_l[n ] + \\acute{\\sigma}^2_l[n ] ) / q } \\right\\}},\\ ] ] for each link @xmath5 and time @xmath34 , where @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] are the average of the @xmath37 samples of @xmath38 $ ] before and after time @xmath11 , respectively , @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] are the sample variances of @xmath38 $ ] before and after time @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath41 is used to prevent division - by - zero .",
    "we use @xmath42 in our experiments .",
    "next , at each time @xmath11 we compute the root - mean - squared ( rms ) average of @xmath43 $ ] over all links @xmath5 , @xmath44 = \\left ( \\frac{1}{l } \\sum_{l=1}^l \\tau^2_l[n ]   \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] time @xmath11 is a breakpoint index if @xmath45 \\ge \\gamma$ ] , where @xmath46 is a predetermined threshold . for any time window , we also consider the starting time index and ending time index as breakpoints . at the current time @xmath27 , with a window length @xmath22 , the starting and ending time indices are @xmath47 and @xmath27 .",
    "breakpoints are used to remove the mean from the raw rss as follows : @xmath48 = r_l[n ] - \\tilde{r}_l[n],\\ ] ] where @xmath49 $ ] is the average of @xmath38 $ ] for all @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is latest breakpoint before or at time index @xmath11 , and @xmath53 is the earliest breakpoint after time @xmath11 .",
    "essentially , the mean model @xmath49 $ ] is piecewise constant , with transition times at each breakpoint . after performing mean removal in ( [ e : meanremovalbreakpoint ] ) , we use our new rss signal @xmath29 $ ] in ( [ e : psd ] ) to perform breathing rate estimation .    .breathing rate estimator and experiment parameters . [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in prior work @xcite , nodes used only one channel .",
    "we are interested in whether our performance has improved due to the measurement of multiple channels . here , we test the performance during the nap experiment when only links from a subset of the channels are used .",
    "we test each possible ( non - empty ) subset of the five measured channels , and plot the rms - median performance in figure [ f : nap_rmsdm_subset_channels ] .",
    "first , using all @xmath20 nodes , we see average performance improves as the number of utilized channels increases , although slowly . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the average rms - median is 1.56 bpm , while when using all @xmath21 channels , the value is 0.91 , a 41% reduction .",
    "the result is much more pronounced when re - running the test using only the nodes @xmath55 .",
    "these were a set of four sensors at height 67 cm closest to the bed , which achieve a rms - median of 0.83 when using all @xmath21 channels .",
    "the improvement for this set , when increasing from one to four channels , is dramatic .",
    "the average rms - median with @xmath54 for this set of nodes is 2.54  thus five channels achieves a 73% reduction .",
    "interestingly , in some cases , a lower number of channels and a lower number of nodes can actually improve performance .",
    "we do not believe that it is better , on average , to use fewer sensors or fewer channels , because we may not know ahead of time which sensor positions will be best , and we ca nt know ahead of time which set of channels is best .",
    "regardless , future work may exploit adaptive methods to select channels from among those that can be measured , or adapt which set of sensors should be operating , in order to best estimate breathing rate .",
    "such adaptive protocols could dramatically reduce the energy used in a breathing monitoring rf sensor network .",
    "further , it would seem that better algorithms , which are more aligned with the statistics of the measured data , should be developed so that it does nt _ degrade _ performance when more links data is included .",
    "this paper demonstrates key advances for the use of rss in a wireless network to monitor the breathing of a person in the deployment area .",
    "first , we introduce a new method for mean removal that makes the method robust to small movements , a key requirement to be able to perform rss - based breathing monitoring in real - world residential scenarios .",
    "second , we show that the link psd at the breathing rate can be used to estimate the location of the breathing person .",
    "we test both advances using a multi - channel network deployed in an apartment building .",
    "the results show the possibilities for accurate and reliable breathing monitoring and localization of a breathing person for a variety of applications .",
    "the area of wireless network breathing monitoring has many unanswered questions .",
    "what are good statistical and radio propagation models that explain a link s ability to measure breathing as a function of the person s position ? can adaptive algorithms and protocols be used to reduce the sampling requirements , and thus reduce the traffic and energy required for breathing monitoring ? how should breathing be measured with other wireless hardware , such as 802.11 devices ? what algorithms should be used to monitor and track the breathing of multiple people in the same deployment area ? what wlan protocols could be used to prevent an adversary from surreptitiously using someone s wireless network to eavesdrop on their breathing ? each of these questions may result in interesting and useful research directions .",
