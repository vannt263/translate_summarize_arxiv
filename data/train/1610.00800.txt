    "]    with the emergence of graphene as one of the hottest research topics in recent years , interest in quasi-2d materials has been rising steadily . an important characteristic of these systems are phonon spectra .",
    "state - of - the - art atomistic calculations of phonon frequencies based on _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) start with the calculation of the hessian ( or force - constant ) matrix using energy differences associated with finite displacements of all atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the phonon frequencies are then obtained from the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix constructed from the hessian matrix .",
    "this approach works very well for all phonons except for long - wavelength acoustic modes in quasi-2d systems .",
    "there , all practical implementations require the use of very large supercells , dense k - meshes , and a highly converged basis to obtain a sufficiently accurate dynamical matrix .",
    "even small inaccuracies caused by computer resource limitations commonly lead to imaginary frequencies in long - wavelength flexural za modes  .",
    "this artifact has nothing to do with a structural instability , but is rather intrinsic to the way the dynamical matrix is constructed and diagonalized .",
    "even though this shortcoming does not affect other modes much , its unphysical consequences have been discussed widely .",
    "so far , no practicable , predictive and accurate alternative approach has been proposed to determine the frequency of long - wavelength za modes , which  among others ",
    "play an important role in thermal conductivity of graphene nanoribbons  @xcite .    to address the long - standing problem with the computation of long - wavelength flexural za modes in atomically thin layers",
    ", we propose a quantitatively predictive and physically intuitive approach based on continuum elasticity theory .",
    "we describe a layer , independent of its thickness , by a membrane , characterize its elastic behavior by a @xmath0 elastic matrix as well as the flexural rigidity @xmath1 .",
    "we present simple quantitative expressions for frequencies of long - wavelength acoustic za and  for the sake of completeness  also for the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) and transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes , which we determine using 2d elastic constants calculated by _ ab initio _ density functional theory .",
    "the calculated spectra accurately reproduce observed and calculated long - wavelength phonon spectra of graphene and phosphorene , the monolayer of black phosphorus .",
    "our approach also correctly describes the observed dependence of the radial breathing mode frequency on the diameter of carbon fullerenes and nanotubes .",
    "use of continuum elasticity theory as a means to determine the frequencies of long - wavelength acoustic phonons is well established  @xcite , including its extension to plates of finite thickness  .",
    "elastic constants have also been related to specific phonon modes in graphene  . yet independent of thickness , any plate can be mapped onto a 2d elastic membrane .",
    "even though quantifying its elastic response to uniform static stress is all that is needed to correctly reproduce all three acoustic branches in the long - wavelength limit , this knowledge has been used only in a limited fashion to calculate phonon spectra of quasi-2d systems . in the following ,",
    "we introduce a @xmath0 elastic stiffness matrix for 2d membranes and relate it to the commonly used @xmath2 elastic matrix for 3d systems .",
    "we then derive quantitatively predictive , simple expressions for long - wavelength acoustic phonon frequencies in these structures based on the 2d elastic constants and flexural rigidity d , which we determine using static dft calculations for the deformation energy of unit cells with few atoms . the quadratic frequency dependence on the crystal momentum for za and the linear dependence for la and ta modes is quantitatively reproduced near the brillouin zone center using these 2d elastic constants and @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , our approach is limited to long - wavelength acoustic modes . to obtain the full phonon spectrum ,",
    "these results can be combined with those of atomistic dft calculations , which do not display convergence problems for optical and short - wavelength acoustic modes .",
