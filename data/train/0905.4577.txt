    "astrophysics observables tell us that @xmath4 of the matter in the universe is not described in terms of the standard model ( sm ) matter .",
    "thus , the search for the traces of new physics is a fundamental problem of particle physics .",
    "there are two strategies to look for the effects of new physics : experiments at high energy and experiments at low energy . in high - energy experiments",
    "it is considered that due to a huge amount of energy the heavy degrees of freedom presumably characteristic of the sm extension sector are possible to excite . in low - energy experiments it is huge statistics that compensates the lack of energy by measuring the rare processes characteristic of such extensions . at present",
    ", there is no any evidence for deviation of sm predictions from the results of high - energy experiments and we are waiting for the lhc epoch .",
    "on the other hand , in low - energy experiments there are rough edges indicating such deviations .",
    "the most famous example is the muon @xmath5 .",
    "below it will be shown that due to recent experimental and theoretical progress the rare process @xmath0 became a good sm test process and that at the moment there is a discrepancy between the sm prediction and experiment at the level of @xmath1 deviation .",
    "in 2007 , the ktev collaboration published the result @xcite for the branching ratio of the pion decay into an electron - positron pair @xmath6 the result is based on observation of 794 candidate @xmath7 events using @xmath8 as a source of tagged @xmath9s .",
    "due to a complicated chain of the process and a good technique for final state resolution used by ktev this is a process with low background .",
    "the rare decay @xmath10 has been studied theoretically over the years , starting with the first prediction of the rate by drell @xcite . since no spinless current coupling of quarks to leptons exists ,",
    "the decay is described in the lowest order of qed as a one - loop process via the two - photon intermediate state , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . a factor of @xmath11 corresponding to the approximate helicity conservation of the interaction and two orders of @xmath12",
    "suppress the decay with respect to the @xmath13 decay , leading to an expected branching ratio of about @xmath14 . in the standard model contributions from the weak interaction to this process are many orders of magnitude smaller and can be neglected .",
    "process with a pion @xmath15 form factor in the vertex.,width=188 ]    to the lowest order in qed the normalized branching ratio is given by@xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the form factor of the transition @xmath23 with off - shell photons .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath19 is defined uniquely as @xmath24 it comes from the contribution of real photons in the intermediate state and is model independent since @xmath25 .",
    "using inequality @xmath26 one can get the well - known unitary bound for the branching ratio @xcite@xmath27    one can attempt to reconstruct the full amplitude by using a once - subtracted dispersion relation @xcite @xmath28 if one assumes that eq .",
    "( [ i m ] ) is valid for any @xmath29 , then one arrives for @xmath30 at @xcite@xmath31 , \\label{rqb } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the dilogarithm function . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ rqb ] ) takes into account a strong @xmath33 dependence of the amplitude around the point @xmath34 occurring due to the branch cut coming from the two - photon intermediate state . in the leading order in @xmath35",
    "( [ rqb ] ) reduces to @xmath36    thus , the amplitude is fully reconstructed up to a subtraction constant .",
    "usually , this constant containing the nontrivial dynamics of the process is calculated within different models describing the form factor @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been shown in @xcite that this constant may be expressed in terms of the inverse moment of the pion transition form factor given in symmetric kinematics of spacelike photons@xmath38.\\label{r0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 is an arbitrary ( factorization ) scale .",
    "one has to note that the logarithmic dependence of the first term on @xmath39 is compensated by the scale dependence of the integrals in the brackets . in this way",
    "two independent processes becomes related .",
    "in order to estimate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) , one needs to define the pion transition form factor in symmetric kinematics for spacelike photon momenta .",
    "since it is unknown from the first principles , we will adapt the available experimental data to perform such estimates .",
    "let us first use the fact that @xmath41 for @xmath42 in order to obtain the lower bound of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) . for this purpose , we take the experimental results from the cello @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations for the pion transition form factor in asymmetric kinematics for spacelike photon momentum which is well parameterized by the monopole form @xcite @xmath43    for this type of the form factor one finds from eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) that @xmath44 thus , for the branching ratio we are able to establish the important lower bound which considerably improves the unitary bound given by eq .",
    "( [ unitb ] ) @xmath45    it is natural to assume that the monopole form is also a good parametrization for the form factor in symmetric kinematics @xmath46 the scale @xmath47 can be fixed from the relation for the slopes of the form factors in symmetric and asymmetric kinematics at low @xmath48 @xcite , @xmath49 that gives @xmath50 .",
    "note that a similar reduction of the scale is also predicted by ope qcd from the large momentum behavior of the form factors : @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "thus , the estimate for @xmath52 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rcleo ] ) by shifting the lower bound by a positive number which belongs to the interval @xmath53 $ ] @xmath54 with this result the branching ratio becomes @xmath55 this is @xmath56 standard deviations lower than the ktev result given by eq .",
    "( [ ktev ] ) .",
    "the @xmath57 decay can be analyzed in a similar manner . as in the pion case",
    ", the cleo collaboration has parameterized the data for the @xmath2-meson in the monopole form @xcite : @xmath58 which is very close to the relevant pion parameter . then following the previous case ( with evident substitutions )",
    ", one finds the bounds for the @xmath59 limit of the amplitude @xmath60 as @xmath61 and for @xmath62 one gets again eq .",
    "( [ rcleo ] ) .",
    "the obtained estimates allow one to find the bounds for the branching ratios @xmath63 it is important to note that for the decay @xmath60 we get the upper limit for the branching .",
    "this is because the real part of the amplitude for this process taken at the physical point @xmath64 for the parameter @xmath65 remains negative and a positive shift due to the change of the scale @xmath66 reduces the absolute value of the real part of the amplitude @xmath67 . at the same time , considering the decays of @xmath68 and @xmath2 into an electron - positron pair , the evolution to physical point ( [ rqb ] ) makes the real part of the amplitude to be positive for the parameter @xmath69 and the absolute value of the real part of the amplitude increases in changing the scales of the meson form factors .",
    "the predicted branchings are given in the table and compared with existing experimental data .",
    "the so - called unitary bound appears if in ( [ b ] ) only the imaginary part of the amplitude which is model independent is taken into account .",
    "the cleo bound corresponds to the estimate of the real part of the amplitude basing on the cello and cleo data on the meson transition from factors @xcite .",
    "the fourth column of the table contains the predictions where in addition the constraint from ope qcd on the transition form factor for arbitrary photon virtualities is taken into account@xcite .",
    "the results that take into account the mass corrections to the amplitude @xcite , mainly due to powers @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the pseudoscalar meson mass and @xmath72 is characteristic scale of the pion transition form factor , are given in the fifth column of the table .",
    "they are essentially visible for @xmath73 meson decays .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath2 decay to muons the mass correction shifts the theoretical prediction in the direction to the unitary bound and thus opposite to the experimental result @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be very desirable to check experimentally the predicted bounds for the process",
    "@xmath60 . also note the recent measurement by the wasa / celcius collaboration @xcite which improves the upper limit for the branching @xmath62 .    for @xmath74",
    "decays there appear new thresholds in addition to the two - photon one . in general , this violates the unitary bound because the correction @xmath75 gains an imaginary part at @xmath76 @xmath77 as it is seen from the table , this happens for the @xmath78 channel .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the predictions for this channel are quite accurate .",

    "therefore , it is extremely important to trace possible sources of the discrepancy between the ktev experiment and theory",
    ". there are a few possibilities : ( 1 ) problems with ( statistic ) experiment procession , ( 2 ) inclusion of qed radiation corrections by ktev is wrong , ( 3 ) unaccounted mass corrections are important , and ( 4 ) effects of new physics . at the moment",
    ", the last possibilities were reinvestigated . in @xcite ,",
    "the contribution of qed radiative corrections to the @xmath10 decay , which must be taken into account when comparing the theoretical prediction ( [ bt ] ) with the experimental result ( [ ktev ] ) , was revised . comparing with earlier calculations @xcite ,",
    "the main progress is in the detailed consideration of the @xmath108 subprocess and revealing of dynamics of large and small distances .",
    "occasionally , this number agrees well with the earlier prediction based on calculations @xcite and , thus , the ktev analysis of radiative corrections is confirmed . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the mass corrections are under control and do not resolve the problem .",
    "so our main conclusion is that the inclusion of radiative and mass corrections is unable to reduce the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction for the decay rate ( [ bt ] ) and experimental result ( [ ktev ] ) .",
    "if one thinks about an extension of the standard model in terms of heavy , of an order of @xmath109 gev or higher , particles , then the contribution of this sort of particles to the pion decay is negligible .",
    "however , there is a class of models for description of dark matter with a mass spectrum of particles of an order of 10 mev @xcite .",
    "this model postulates a neutral scalar dark matter particle @xmath110 which annihilates to produce electron / positron pairs : @xmath111 .",
    "the excess positrons produced in this annihilation reaction could be responsible for the bright 511 kev line emanating from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the effects of low mass vector boson @xmath112 appearing in such model of dark matter were considered in @xcite where the excess of ktev data over theory put the constraint on coupling which is consistent with that coming from the muon anomalous magnetic moment and relic radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , the pion decay might be a filtering process for light dark matter particles .",
    "let us now consider the amplitude @xmath113 in the context of the constituent quark model @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the pion form factor is given by the quark - loop ( triangle ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) diagram with momentum independent constituent quark mass .",
    "the result for the form factor in symmetric kinematics is given by @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 , and the amplitude at zero is @xmath116 it is interesting to remind that in asymmetric kinematics the form factor has double logarithmic asymptotics at large momentum transfer @xmath117 @xcite @xmath118    recently babar collaboration announced new data @xcite on pion transition form factor @xmath119 at very large @xmath48 up to 40 gev@xmath120 .",
    "the data are in strong contradiction with massless qcd predicting asymptotic @xmath121 behavior with single logariphmic modulation in leading order . however , the babar data are well fitted by ( [ ftt ] ) if the parameter @xmath122 is taken as @xmath123 mev .",
    "then the amplitude at zero is @xmath124 which is still far from numbers corresponding to ktev : @xmath125 . in @xcite",
    "it was also noted that in order to get reasonable estimate of the hadronic vacuum polarization to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon it is necessary to take the quark mass rather small @xmath126 mev , the value which is close to the pion mass .    within perturbative qcd one possible scenario to explain the form factor growth faster than expected",
    "is to assume that the full resummation of perturbative logarithms is important . indeed , sometime ago manohar augmented @xcite that for the pion transition form factor in kinematics when one photon is virtual and other is quasireal the resummation effects dominate its behavior at large fixed @xmath127 and probably babar ( if confirmed ) observes these effects ( logarithmic or powerlike ) .",
    "5[fig : largenenough ]    .",
    "the data are from cello @xcite , cleo @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations .",
    "the dashed line is massless qcd asymptotic limit .",
    "the solid line is the form factor calculated from massive triangle diagram , eq .",
    "( [ ftt ] ) , with mass parameter taken as @xmath128 mev.,width=340 ]    further independent experiments at kloe , na48 , wasaatcosy , bes iii and other facilities will be crucial for resolution of the problem with the rare leptonic decays of light pseudoscalr mesons .",
    "also it is important to confirm the theoretical base for maximally model independent prediction of the branchings by getting more precise data on the pion transition form factor in asymmetric as well in symmetric kinematics in wider region of momentum transfer that is soon expected from babar and belle collaborations .",
