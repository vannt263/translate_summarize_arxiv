    "in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite , the charged - current electro - weak interactions amongst three generations of quarks involve a complex , unitary @xmath1 matrix , @xmath2 , known as the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "its elements , , determine the relative ( weak ) couplings of up - type ( , @xmath3 ) and down - type ( , @xmath4 ) quarks to the @xmath5  boson .",
    "the matrix @xmath2 is determined by four independent parameters , one of which can be used to describe cp violation ( cpv ) . a parameterization developed by wolfenstein emphasizes the hierarchy of elements by expanding them in powers of the sine of the cabibbo angle : @xmath6 .",
    "the other three parameters are labelled @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , with @xmath9 describing the level of cpv . in the improved wolfenstein parameterization",
    "@xcite , using @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the matrix reads :    @xmath12    the unitarity constraint results in six orthogonality equations which can be expressed geometrically by six uts in the complex plane .",
    "all triangles have the same area , @xmath13 , which determines the level of cpv : @xmath14 .",
    "most triangles are squashed , , one side is very much smaller than the others .",
    "however , there is one `` golden triangle '' with all sides of approximately equal size ( , @xmath15 ) , determined by products of ckm elements that are experimentally most accessible :    @xmath16    it is customary to re - scale its sides by @xmath17 , resulting in a triangle in the complex plane with a unit - length baseline on the real axis .",
    "the ut in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 plane has sides of length : @xmath20    in order to over - constrain the ut as a test of the sm , it is thus imperative to measure as many of the angles as possible , and improve the measurements of the relatively poorly known elements , , and  which determine the sides .",
    "( note that  and  are know to about 0.1% and 1% , respectively . )    six ckm elements , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , can currently be determined directly from tree - level processes .",
    "the remaining three elements , @xmath24 , involve the top quark and are currently accessible only via loop processes in the @xmath25 and @xmath26  system ( , rare @xmath25 and @xmath26  decay , and @xmath27 mixing ) . in the lhc",
    "/ lc future , @xmath24 and @xmath22 will be measured at tree level from top and @xmath5  decay , respectively , possibly with very high precision  @xcite .",
    "a general problem in determining ckm matrix elements arises from the fact that they enter into the charged currents between _ quarks _ , whereas experiments observe initial and final states containing _ hadrons _",
    "and/or leptons .",
    "the `` dressing '' of quarks makes for strong - interaction effects that are difficult to deal with , in particular since one is often in the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the problem is somewhat simplified for semi - leptonic decays , because the ( leptonic ) @xmath5  decay is well - understood and can be factored out .",
    "the formalism to evaluate ( weak ) decay amplitudes of hadrons is that of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and renormalization group evolution . using a scale , @xmath28 , long- and short - distance contributions",
    "are separated into perturbative ( and thus calculable ) wilson coefficients , @xmath29 , and non - perturbative hadronic matrix elements , @xmath30 , written in terms of local operators generated by qcd and electroweak interactions : @xmath31    the tool of choice to get at hadronic matrix elements , in particular for _ exclusive _ final states , is lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , which has recently made great strides towards unquenched calculations , which could eventually yield quantifiable errors at the @xmath32(1% ) level . until then , other methods ( , @xmath33  expansion , qcd sum rules , chiral perturbation theory , ) have to be used , the results of which are usually formulated in terms of ( meson ) decay constants and form factors ( ffs ) .    in case of the heavy - to - heavy @xmath34 transition , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",
    "can provide an absolute normalization for ffs at @xmath35 and in the infinite quark mass limit , with corrections of the order of only 10% .",
    "unfortunately , no such luck for the heavy - to - light @xmath36 transition : the ff absolute normalization ( and possibly the @xmath37 dependence ) must be calculated from the ground up .",
    "_ inclusive _ ( semi - leptonic ) decays of @xmath26  mesons turn out to be particularly favorable , for their treatment in the framework of heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) allows a well - defined expansion of the decay rate in powers of @xmath38 ( perturbative part ) and  ( non - perturbative part ) :    @xmath39\\ , ,   \\label{eq : gbxellnu}\\ ] ]    where the first ( and dominant ) term represents the well - known quark spectator model rate ( containing @xmath40 ) .",
    "non - perturbative corrections are suppressed by at least two powers of  and can be expressed in terms of a small number of measurable parameters .",
    "this approach is valid only under the _ ab initio _ assumption of quark - hadron duality , which needs experimental verification . as has been advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the semi - leptonic data itself can be used to test for duality violations by checking consistency among a variety of ope - calculated variables .",
    "@xmath41 normalizes the baseline of the ut and determines the wolfenstein parameter @xmath7 ( together with @xmath42 , which is very precisely known ) .",
    "@xmath41 can be determined from the decay @xmath43 by measuring the differential decay rate : @xmath44    and extrapolating the ff @xmath45 to the kinematic limit @xmath46 , where hqet provides an absolute normalization in the form of the isgur - wise function : @xmath47 . in the limit of infinite quark masses , @xmath48 .",
    "finite - mass and perturbative qed / qcd corrections are subsumed into the @xmath49 factor , yielding @xmath50 .",
    "this value for @xmath51 results from a combination of quark model , ope sum rule , and ( quenched ) lqcd calculations .",
    "it is promising to note that the lqcd calculation can provide a rather detailed breakdown of the errors , with the single largest one being statistical in nature .",
    "issues affecting this type of measurement are the assumed shape of the ff , parameterized in terms of its slope , @xmath52 , at @xmath53 , the relative vector and axial vector contributions to the ff , and the treatment of feed down background from hadronic systems heavier than the @xmath54 . a particular problem for experiments running on the  resonance lies in understanding the detection efficiency for the slow charged pion in the @xmath55 decay .",
    "an important cross check is a simultaneous measurement of the @xmath56 decay , so far performed only by cleo .",
    "all these issues need to be tackled in order to improve the measurement beyond the current 5.2% error ( which is , however , dominated by the theoretical error on @xmath51 ) . moreover , the @xmath43 and @xmath57 data should be fit together to reduce the error on the ff slope , since the slopes in both channels are related to each other in a calculable way .",
    "the lep  working group ( wg )  @xcite has combined the belle , cleo , and lep measurements of @xmath58  @xmath52  note that those two quantities are highly correlated  after adjusting for common inputs .",
    "most measurements and their errors are changed only slightly by this procedure , except for the aleph result for which @xmath58 and @xmath52 increase by 1.5 @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is four times as large as the old one .",
    "unfortunately , the cited ref .",
    "@xcite does not provide quite enough information to reconstruct these calculations . despite these changes ,",
    "the aleph and cleo measurements remain rather far apart , resulting in a somewhat low confidence level ( cl ) of only 5% for the new wa .",
    "one should also point out that the @xmath41 value extracted from the exclusive cleo measurement by dividing out the above @xmath51 comes out rather high compared with the ( presumably correlated ) inclusive cleo measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath41 can also be extracted from the _ inclusive _ semi - leptonic branching fraction ( bf ) @xmath61 . in order to distinguish prompt leptons ( in @xmath62 ) from cascade leptons ( in @xmath63 ) ,  experiments use a double - lepton technique : a high - momentum lepton tags the opposite @xmath26 , allowing to measure a signal - lepton down to center - of - mass ( com ) momenta of @xmath64 by exploiting charge and angular correlations .",
    "table  [ tab : inclbsl ] shows the most current set of  measurements , which are consistent with the lep average .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ inclusive @xmath26 semi - leptonic bfs . in calculating the  average , the systematic errors have ( wrongly ) been assumed to be uncorrelated among experiments . _ [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : inclbsl ]    after subtracting the ( small ) @xmath65 contribution , these bfs can be used to determine @xmath41 , albeit with a 5.9% theoretical error . as indicated in connection with equation  [ eq : gbxellnu ] ,",
    "the theoretical error can be reduced by expressing the non - perturbative contributions to the semi - leptonic width in terms of three parameters ( at order @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 , , and , all of which are _ measurable _ up to uncertainties of order @xmath68 .",
    "the parameter  is readily determined from the @xmath69  mass splitting ; the other two require more elaborate measurements .    several experiments have embarked on a program to measure ( and thus @xmath70 ) and  from a variety of moments in semi - leptonic and radiative @xmath26  decay data .",
    "for example , cleo has measured the first moment of the photon energy in @xmath71 to determine , and the first moment of the hadronic mass - squared , , recoiling against the di - leptons in @xmath62 to determine . with these parameters as input , the above - mentioned ( inclusive ) semi - leptonic bfs have been used to determine @xmath41 with a 2.6% total error ( and consistent with the exclusive result ) .",
    "this all looks very promising and should improve even further , with preliminary cleo  @xcite and delphi  @xcite measurements of lepton energy moments in @xmath62 on their way .",
    "one trouble spot has emerged , though , highlighted by the preliminary measurement of  minimum lepton com momentum ,  @xcite : while they obtain a result consistent with cleo for the same cut of 1.5 , they find a  dependence of  that can not be described by the cleo values for  and  ( but _ can _ be described by ope using a different set of parameter values ) .",
    "this inconsistency suggests that some of the underlying assumptions hqe is based on require further scrutiny .",
    "the second side of the ut , @xmath72 , is determined by @xmath73 ; see equation  [ eq : rurt ] .      using the ope , the inclusive semi - leptonic bf @xmath74 can be related to @xmath75 with an accuracy of @xmath76% .",
    "unfortunately , experiments can only observe a small portion of this decay : the overwhelming @xmath62 background forces them to impose stringent analysis cuts , selecting a very restricted region of phase space near kinematic boundaries ( , high lepton momentum , and/or low hadronic mass ) . under those circumstances",
    ", ope can not reliably predict the ( partial ) decay rate due to non - convergence .",
    "the theorists way out of that is a `` twist expansion '' with the complete series of terms re - summed into an incalculable structure function ( light - cone distribution function ) , describing the fermi motion of the @xmath77  quark inside the the @xmath26  meson .",
    "this structure / distribution function determines the decay rate at leading order , with sub - leading twist corrections suppressed by ( higher ) powers of .",
    "historically , it has been modeled in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ way , with the theoretical uncertainty in the fraction of events passing the analysis cuts estimated by varying the shape parameters .",
    "this uncertainty can be removed in principle , though , because the structure / distribution function is a property of the @xmath26  meson itself and can thus be determined ( to leading order ) in other processes , for example , @xmath71 .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is an uncontrollable uncertainty for @xmath73 , estimated at @xmath78% , from transferring the @xmath71 structure / distribution function to @xmath65 due to the sub - leading @xmath32 ( ) corrections .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite presents an actual calculation of the dominant source of power corrections , verifying the size of the effect , with a residual uncertainty for @xmath73 of only a few percent .",
    "the issue of sub - leading corrections needs to be resolved among the theorists , because it affects the recent lepton - endpoint @xmath73 measurements from cleo  @xcite and  @xcite in one of two ways : either the theoretical error associated with this needs to more than double ( dominating then any other single error ) , or the value of @xmath73 needs to change by @xmath79% ( corresponding to @xmath80 of the theoretical error associated with this previously ) . on top of all of this , one has to worry about the restrictive analyses introducing quark - hadron duality violations , for which no estimate whatsoever exists currently .",
    "one can nevertheless hold out hope for the future of ( inclusive ) @xmath73 measurements because of the enormous data samples becoming available at the  @xmath26  factories .",
    "the most promising analysis technique with hundreds of millions of @xmath26s is that of fully reconstructing one of the two @xmath26s in the event , thus gaining complete control over the kinematics of the semi - leptonically decaying signal @xmath26 .",
    "this allows rather precise neutrino reconstruction , and charm suppression without kinematic cuts using particle identification ( , no kaon on the signal side ) .",
    "furthermore , one can hope to use lepton momentum , hadronic mass , and di - lepton mass simultaneously to isolate @xmath65 while retaining sufficient inclusiveness for ope convergence and quark - hadron duality .      the very same @xmath26  reconstruction ( breco ) technique will work beautifully for exclusive decays , , @xmath81 , providing very clean signals , with signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratios @xmath82 . already with the data samples belle and",
    "have in hand , the breco technique is favored over the conventional analysis pioneered by cleo .",
    "the main problem for extracting @xmath73 from these @xmath26  decay channels is again theoretical in nature : a transition ff is needed , which can currently be calculated only with uncertainties in the @xmath83% range .",
    "all hopes rest , again , on lqcd to eventually provide unquenched calculations with much improved precision for channels with stable particles ( , @xmath84 ) or _ narrow _ resonances ( , @xmath85 ) .",
    "fully - leptonic @xmath26  decay provide the theoretically cleanest way to determine @xmath73 : @xmath86    unfortunately , the current best lqcd determination of the @xmath26  decay constant comes with a 15% error : @xmath87 . with a sm expectation of @xmath88 , observation of this decay",
    "is just around the corner , exploiting again the breco technique .",
    "hopefully , lqcd will manage to push down their error as fast as the @xmath26  factories accumulate data .",
    "the third side of the ut , @xmath89 , is determined by @xmath90 .",
    "it can be extracted from , the @xmath91 mass difference measured in mixing : @xmath92    where lqcd provides  @xcite @xmath93 with a 17% uncertainty .",
    "it has been customary to use the _ ratio _ @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the corresponding mass difference from @xmath96 mixing , because the _ ratio _ @xmath97 was believed to be better known ( and most other factors cancel ) .",
    "using @xmath98 together with the lep / sld / cdf mixing amplitude analysis , @xmath99 at 95%  cl , one can get a significant constraint on @xmath89 : @xmath100 =                    \\frac{1}{\\xi^2 } \\lambda^2 r_t^2 \\label{eq : dmddms}\\ ] ]    however , it was recently discovered  @xcite that @xmath101 might have to change by 4@xmath102 and assume an error twice as large as currently , resulting in a much relaxed constraint on @xmath89 .",
    "( inclusive ) @xmath41 is becoming a precision quantity with an uncertainty of less than 3% ; it could become even more precise with better measurements of hqe non - perturbative parameters  barring quark - hadron duality violations .",
    "@xmath73 is far from that , with an uncertainty of about 15% .",
    "there are good prospects , though , for significant improvements over the next few years : new analysis approaches can significantly reduce both the experimental _ and _ theoretical errors of the inclusive measurements .",
    "the exclusive measurements will equally benefit , contingent upon sufficient progress in lqcd .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath103 are awaiting a more precise @xmath101  ratio from lqcd and , more importantly , a _ measurement _ of ( not a _ limit _ on ) @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath104 will benefit from consistent neutron @xmath105-decay data on @xmath106 and from better pion @xmath105-decay data .",
    "@xmath107 is awaiting a ( theoretical ) conclusion on the right value and error for the @xmath108 transition ff .",
