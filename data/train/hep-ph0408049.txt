    "the discovery of single - top - quark production will be the flagship measurement of run ii at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "preliminary run ii results @xcite are already surpassing the limits set by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations using data from run i. over the next few years , the single - top - quark cross sections will be accurately measured at both the fermilab tevatron @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in order to compare the coming measurements of single - top - quark production to theory ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the predictions for jet distributions , and the associated uncertainties is required .",
    "the measurement of single - top - quark production will provide an excellent opportunity to study the charged - current weak - interaction of the top quark . within the standard model ,",
    "a measurement of the cross section allows direct extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodvtb ] we see that @xmath3 appears in the leading - order ( lo ) feynman diagrams for @xmath1-channel production @xcite , @xmath0-channel production @xcite , and @xmath4-associated production @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on @xmath0-channel and @xmath1-channel production , which have sizable cross sections , and may be distinguished experimentally by the number of @xmath5 tags in the final state @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath4-associated production cross section is small at the tevatron , and no differential next - to - leading - order calculation exists , @xmath4 production is not addressed here .",
    "= 3.125 in    models that extend the standard model often predict large corrections to @xmath0-channel or @xmath1-channel production , but not to both @xcite . anything that produces an anomalous coupling @xcite , or flavor changing neutral current @xcite , between the top quark and any other quark opens new production modes in the @xmath1-channel , but only slightly reduces the fraction of @xmath5 jets in @xmath0-channel production .",
    "conversely , any process that allows a new intermediate particle , such as strong dynamics @xcite , a charged top - pion @xcite , kaluza - klein modes of the @xmath6 @xcite , or a @xmath7 boson @xcite , would enhance @xmath0-channel production , but is highly mass suppressed in @xmath1-channel production . in fact , @xmath0-channel single - top - quark production has been found to be the most sensitive probe of high - mass charged vector @xmath8 bosons @xcite at the tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite .    both @xmath0-channel and @xmath1-channel production are important in direct searches for cp violation @xcite , @xmath9-parity - conserving supersymmetry @xcite , and @xmath9-parity - violating supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "both channels also contribute a significant background to all signals that include @xmath10 with , or without , @xmath5 tags .",
    "these backgrounds appear in a number of higgs search channels @xcite and other new physics , such as @xmath9-parity - conserving @xcite and @xmath9-parity - violating @xcite supersymmetry searches .",
    "the analytic form of the fully differential next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) cross section for @xmath0-channel and @xmath1-channel production of a single top - quark plus one jet appears in ref .",
    ". the spin - averaged version of that calculation is available from this author in the form of a fortran program called ztop , and is used in this paper .",
    "a recurring theme throughout the analysis of the kinematic distributions is that the next - to - leading - order calculation describes _ jets _ , and not partons .",
    "this affects the questions that may be asked about the final state , and contributes additional challenges to the matching between theory and experiment .    the ultimate goal of performing differential calculations at next - to - leading order is to improve the quantitative connection between theory and experiment .",
    "as important as the distributions themselves , is a reliable estimate of the uncertainties in these distributions .",
    "previous estimates of the uncertainties in the parton luminosities and kinematics @xcite have been somewhat rough , and are revisited with more careful analysis .",
    "analytic calculations are not typically compared to raw data , but rather to event generators , such as herwig @xcite and pythia @xcite , that have been tuned to fit the data .",
    "it is vital to determine whether these event generators at least predict the shapes of the measured distributions accurately .",
    "we will see that the current event generators provide very poor predictions of both @xmath0-channel and @xmath1-channel production .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . a general search strategy for discovering single - top - quark production appears in sec .",
    "[ sec : discovery ] .",
    "this lays the groundwork for discussing the event rates in terms of the number of jets in the final state .",

    "the paper concludes in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] with a few directions for improvement .",
    "the final state for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-channel production of single top quarks contains two jets plus the decay of a @xmath6 boson . in order to extract the signal from the backgrounds ,",
    "the decay of the @xmath6 to an electron or muon , and a neutrino is used .",
    "the most serious background for single - top - quark production is the production of @xmath11 pairs @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath11 pairs that will be reconstructed in detectors at the tevatron is about 5 times the total number of single - top - quark events in the 1 @xmath5-tag sample , and about 10 times the number in the 2 @xmath5-tag sample . because there is already a top quark in the final state",
    ", the essence of any study will be to reduce the @xmath11 background , while maintaining a measurable signal .    the most effective method to discover single - top - quark production uses a `` jet veto , '' which was first proposed in ref .",
    "this method relies on the observation that in @xmath11 production , the extra top quark tends to produce additional high-@xmath12 objects ( leptons or jets ) in the final state .",
    "the basic strategy is to form a sample of two jets , a lepton , and missing transverse energy @xmath12 .",
    "if there are any additional isolated `` hard '' jets or leptons then the event is rejected .",
    "the term `` hard '' can be loosely defined to refer to any jet or lepton with @xmath13@xmath14 gev , and @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "experimentally , the `` jet veto '' is identical to separating the final states into a @xmath17 jet exclusive sample and a @xmath18 jet inclusive sample .    we observe in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite that placing cuts anywhere in the region of @xmath19@xmath14 gev for every jet yields the same significance .",
    "the reason is that acceptance for events that contain an extra radiated jet in the signal increases as the cut is lowered ( thereby failing to pass the cuts ) at the same rate that the acceptance for the highest-@xmath12 jet increases .",
    "hence , in order to avoid a sharp drop in efficiency , the jet veto should be set at the same @xmath12 as the cut on the second - highest-@xmath12 jet .",
    "the largest remaining background is @xmath20 production  dominantly @xmath21 in the 1 @xmath5-tag sample , and @xmath22 in the 2 @xmath5-tag sample",
    ". this background decreases as a function of reconstructed top - quark mass .",
    "hence , a top - quark mass cut reduces this to an acceptable level .",
    "if a top - quark mass cut can not be used , e.g. , because of poor jet - energy resolution , other discriminates will have to be found .",
    "however , these will be ineffective without the corrections described in sec .  [",
    "sec : eventgen ] .    the detection strategies of refs .",
    "@xcite should be merged into a program of three successive measurements .",
    "the first stage measures the @xmath17 jet signal with at least 1 @xmath5 tag .",
    "this sums over all single - top - quark production modes , and requires the least amount of integrated luminosity for discovery . as data",
    "is accumulated , the samples can be split into independent subsets with 1 or 2 @xmath5 tags . the 1 @xmath5-tag sample can be used to study @xmath1-channel production , and the 2 @xmath5-tag sample can be used to study @xmath0-channel production .",
    "fully differential next - to - leading - order cross sections predict _ jet _ distributions ; they do not predict parton distributions . the consequences of this can be subtle , and require care when comparing fixed - order calculations with data , or with showering event generators . to understand these comparisons , only distributions for top - quark production at the tevatron are examined .",
    "distributions for antitop - quark production at the tevatron differ solely by the signs of the pseudorapidities , and figures would be redundant . since the physics issues are identical , no jet distributions for the lhc are shown .",
    "the challenge of calculating differential cross sections is in how to deal with final - state infrared singularities .",
    "different methods have different solutions in detail , but they all impose one of two conditions : include a jet definition , or include a hadronization function .",
    "the first consequence of including a jet definition in the base theoretical calculation is that the same choice of jet definition must be used in any comparison to data .",
    "this may appear obvious , but it contains a subtlety : how do you compare a jet that consists of a few partons with one that contains multiple particles ? in sec .",
    "[ sec : jetdef ] we will see the effect of the choice of jet definition on theoretical distributions .",
    "comparisons between theory and experiment are actually made at the event generator level , rather than directly with data .",
    "hence , in sec .  [ sec : eventgen ] we will adopt an effective solution for matching the nlo calculations to the event generators .    before presenting nlo distributions , we must first understand which distributions are appropriate to calculate .",
    "we might be tempted to look at the lo diagrams and ask for the corresponding nlo distributions , but this would not be useful in general . consider the lo diagram for @xmath1-channel production in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodvtb](a ) . if we plot the nlo transverse momentum of the jet that includes the final - state @xmath23 quark , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlod ] that the calculation is not very stable .",
    "the massive dipole formalism ( mdf ) and phase space slicing ( pss ) calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite provide the same results at the same scale .",
    "the methods only differ in the bin that exactly includes @xmath24 gev , which is an artifact of the different subtractions methods , and in any case not observable .",
    "= 3.125 in    the problem with fig .",
    "[ fig : nlod ] is that the shapes of the distributions are not stable compared to scale variation or perturbative order . at leading order",
    "the @xmath23 quark recoils against the massive top quark , and so has a finite distribution at small @xmath25 . at nlo",
    "the distribution takes an arbitrary value that depends on the choice of scale .",
    "also the shapes at larger ( i.e. measurable ) @xmath25 change between orders , which leads to the false impression that the nlo jets are softer than the lo parton .",
    "this figure demonstrates the danger of interpreting _ jet _ results in _ partonic _ language .",
    "the distribution that should have been plotted is the transverse momentum of the highest-@xmath26 jet . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nloj1 ] we see that this distribution is stable in shape at different orders in perturbation theory , and for different scales . in fact the difference between the lo and nlo distribution is smaller than the nlo scale uncertainty .",
    "we also see that the choice of scale effects only normalization .",
    "hence , we have a very well - predicted quantity .",
    "= 3.125 in    what stabilizes the @xmath26-ordered jet at nlo if the `` @xmath23 '' jet is so unstable ?",
    "the answer is that when the @xmath23 quark becomes softer , the parton that recoils against the top quark is a @xmath27 that came from initial - state splitting of a gluon .",
    "hence , the kinematically stable jet has a different flavor content than the lo jet .",
    "we are fortunate that we can not distinguish experimentally the difference between a jet that started from an up or down quark .",
    "if the jet is produced with a charm or bottom quark , however , we have to track it explicitly because it might be taggable . in the case of @xmath1-channel single - top - quark production , this is ckm - suppressed and occurs less than 1% of the time in the light - quark initiated side of the diagram .",
    "once we look at @xmath26-ordered jets , we will have to keep track of how often the leading jet includes a @xmath5 quark from the other incoming hadron .",
    "this will not cause any stability problems , however , since there are no overlapping singularities between the light - quark and heavy - quark initiated parts of the diagrams .",
    "we have seen the stability of the distribution of the highest-@xmath26 jet between leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "there are two historically relevant questions .",
    "first , how well are the leading jet and top quark distributions modeled by @xmath28 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : prodt](a ) ] or @xmath29 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : prodt](b ) ] parton - level calculations ?",
    "second , how do typical cuts effect the distributions of the top quark and jets ?",
    "the analysis of leading - order @xmath28 production plus showering is postponed until sec .",
    "[ sec : eventgen ] , when we observe the failure of the current event generators to reproduce the jet spectrum .",
    "= 3.125 in    the analytic form of the @xmath1-channel cross section has the same form as double deep - inelastic - scattering ( ddis ) @xcite .",
    "color conservation enforces a natural factorization of the scales . the fermion line in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodt](a ) that does not include a top quark probes a proton with the dis scale @xmath30 , which is identical to the virtuality of the @xmath6 boson through nlo .",
    "the fermion line that does connect to a top quark sees the dis scale for massive quarks of @xmath31 .",
    "another reasonable choice for both scales is the mass of the top quark .",
    "the difference between using the ddis scales , or the top - quark mass is less than 3% at next - to - leading order .",
    "but the cross section and distributions do not change from lo to nlo when the ddis scales are used .",
    "this is an indication of the relation of this calculation to the extraction of parton distribution functions , and dis in general .",
    "even though the leading - order diagram for @xmath1-channel single - top - quark production was known to include a @xmath5 quark in the initial state , the process was modeled by using the @xmath32 diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodt](b ) at leading order in refs .  @xcite . to the extent that the analytic form of the cross section is expected to look like double deep - inelastic - scattering @xcite",
    ", this diagram was expected to give a reasonable approximation of the shape of the nlo top - quark distributions .",
    "indeed , the @xmath33 and pseudorapidity @xmath34 distributions of the top quark are well modeled by the lo @xmath35 calculation . these distributions for @xmath1 production at the tevatron ( a 1.96 tev @xmath36 collider ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tbjptt ] and [ fig : tbjetat ] .",
    "= 3.125 in    = 3.125 in    the diagram @xmath32 should have no visible effect on the distributions of the highest-@xmath26 jet . in figs .",
    "[ fig : tbjptj ] and [ fig : tbjetaj ] we see that there is no difference between the true lo distributions , and the one obtained from @xmath32 alone .",
    "this is an additional confirmation that there is a real separation of physics between the @xmath37 vertex , and the vertex with no top quark .",
    "while this is a nice confirmation of the double - dis interpretation , this means that the distributions for the highest-@xmath26 jet are more central , and slightly harder than indicated by the old approximation .",
    "hence analyses , like that in ref .",
    "@xcite slightly underestimated the true signal .",
    "= 3.125 in    = 3.125 in    finally , let us examine the jet distributions as a first step in understanding the necessity of the next - to - leading - order calculations . in particular , we focus on the distributions that will be required for sec .  [",
    "sec : eventgen ] .",
    "the simple cuts in table  [ tab : cuts ] separate the signal into two subsamples : @xmath38 jet exclusive ( @xmath20 in the experiments , or the `` jet veto '' of ref .",

    "uncertainties arising from the normalization of the distributions produced by the event generators can only be calculated when the fits are performed .",
    "the last uncertainty comes from the fact that the top quark is not decayed in this analysis .",
    "a leading - order estimate already limits this uncertainty to less than 2% for the distributions and search strategy discussed here . however ,",
    "if angular correlations are measured @xcite , or extreme cuts are used , then this uncertainty may be enhanced .",
    "a simple remedy would be to include the decay of the top quark by combining the complete published next - to - leading - order spin - density matrices for production @xcite and decay @xcite into a single program .",
    "the motivation for performing differential calculations at next - to - leading order is to improve the connection between theory and experimental results .",
    "typically , this connection is made through the use of a showering event generator .",
    "these event generators begin with leading - order matrix elements , and model the effects of soft initial and final - state showering , and hadronization .",
    "the essential question is whether these modified leading - order calculations are sufficiently predictive for the final states that will be measured . for pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite ,",
    "the answer is a resounding no .",
    "we begin by examining @xmath1-channel single - top - quark production at the tevatron ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of the situation at the lhc ) .",

    "[ fig : phprod ] . beginning with the correct lo diagram for @xmath38 jet production ,",

    "the origin of the problem is that the showering event generators only produce additional @xmath5 jets from the soft angular - ordered initial - state radiation .",
    "all jets produced this way lead to distributions that are too soft and too far forward .",
    "= 3.15 in    = 3.15 in    the failure of pythia and herwig to model the @xmath47-jet final state has several important consequences : analyses and acceptance studies using pythia or herwig will lead to approximately a factor of 3 underestimate of the cross section in the @xmath22 bin .",
    "this means the cross section for discovery is larger than currently estimated .",
    "however , this also means that the background to other physics analyses has been severely underestimated .",
    "the obvious case is for @xmath0-channel single - top - quark production , which is distinguished from @xmath1-channel production by the number of @xmath5 tags .",

    "the origin of this artifact in pythia is that @xmath0-channel production is implemented by producing a @xmath8 that is set to have the same mass as a real @xmath6 boson .",
    "the problem is that the scale is hard - coded to be the @xmath8 mass .",
    "hence , this extra radiation comes from using too small a scale .",
    "the scale should be something on the order of the invariant mass of the @xmath53 pair @xcite , or at least the top - quark mass .",

    "historically , the ability to interpret the measurement of the single - top - quark cross sections was expected to be dominated by theoretical uncertainties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainties ] , we see that these uncertainties , while still large , are under much better control .",
    "the uncertainty in the top - quark mass completely dominates the prediction for the @xmath0-channel cross section , but this will improve with additional data",
    ". the measurement of the @xmath0-channel cross section will be statistics limited at the tevatron , and difficult to distinguish from backgrounds at the lhc @xcite .",
    "hence , the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath0-channel production should be smaller than the expected experimental accuracy at either a high - luminosity tevatron , or the lhc .    current theoretical uncertainties in @xmath1-channel production limit extraction of @xmath3 to about @xmath76 .",
    "the next - to - leading - order distributions presented in secs .  [ sec : etvsnlo ] and [ sec : gentchan ] improve the kinematic uncertainty in @xmath1-channel production , so that parton distribution function uncertainties will dominate our ability to interpret the data .",
    "this uncertainty could be reduced by measuring the ratio of @xmath1-channel production to @xmath77 production . however , the latter cross section is small , and thus we should consider alternate possibilities , such as @xmath78 or @xmath79 exclusive final states .",
    "any improvement in the measurement of the @xmath5 or gluon distributions at scales near the top - quark mass , and proton momentum fraction @xmath80 near @xmath81 , will directly reduce the remaining theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the availability of fully differential next - to - leading - order calculations for hadronic processes has begun a new era of precision comparisons between theory and experiment . in order to fully realize the potential of these theoretical improvements",
    ", we must first understand how to interpret the calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlopred ] , we see that nlo calculations produce _ jet _ distributions in the final state , rather than _ parton _ distributions .",
    "this forces us to describe the results in terms of @xmath12-ordered jets , rather than nlo distributions of a specific quark .",
    "it further ties the theoretical results to the explicit choice of jet definition .",
    "we see in sec .",
    "[ sec : jetdef ] that the effect of jet definition on the shapes of distributions is larger than all theoretical uncertainties combined .    finally , fixed - order calculations are generally compared to showering event generators , such as pythia and herwig , rather than directly to data , in order to understand detector efficiencies .",
    "therefore , we must understand how to compare next - to - leading - order jets to jets produced from showering .",
    "a simple matching scheme is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : gencor ] , that uses the nlo calculation to normalize the measurable event samples .",
    "ultimately , we would like to have a next - to - leading - order event generator that can handle initial - state and final - state interferences .",
    "now that the theoretical predictions for single - top - quark production are under control , a few questions remain regarding the decay of the top quark .",
    "one of the most interesting features of single - top - quark production is the possibility of measuring the polarization of the top quark @xcite . the program used to produce distributions for this paper , ztop ,",
    "does not decay the top quark .",
    "however the complete analytic nlo spin - density matrices for production do appear in ref .",
    "@xcite , and could be combined with the known nlo decays from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a spin - dependent program would allow an estimate of the uncertainties associated with using alternate search strategies , such as cutting on @xmath82 , the scalar sum of the transverse energies of the particles in the event .",
    "it is clear from the distributions in sec .",
    "[ sec : eventgen ] , that the @xmath82 for single - top - quark production is larger than predicted at lo in the @xmath17 jet inclusive sample .",
    "the inclusion of top - quark decay is necessary to determine whether this is a serious problem or not .",
    "ultimately , a program that includes decays will be necessary to determine whether the single - top - quark background to new physics , such as higgs production , has been greatly underestimated , or whether specific cuts accidentally reduce the discrepancies .",
    "for now , however , we have a reliable theoretical calculation , and method for matching to event generators , that will allow for accurate interpretation of single - top - quark production data when it is discovered .",
