    "we point out that if a pulsar with a mass exceeding @xmath93 at the 2@xmath88 or even 3@xmath88 level would be observed in the future , this would impose severe constraints on the stiffness of the nuclear eos . for the set of eos tested here , only the stiffest models , i.e. d@xmath94c , dd - f4 , bbg , and dbhf would remain viable candidates .",
    "it has been suggested that pulsar  b in the double pulsar system j07373039 may serve to test models proposed for the eos of superdense nuclear matter.@xcite one of the interesting characteristics of this system is that the mass of pulsar  b is merely @xmath95.@xcite such a low mass could be an indication that pulsar  b did not form in a type - ii supernova , triggered by a collapsing iron core , but in a type - i supernova of an onemg white dwarf driven hydrostatically unstable by electron captures onto mg and ne.@xcite the well - established critical density at which the collapse of such stars sets in is @xmath96 . assuming that the loss of matter during the formation of the neutron star is negligible , a predicted baryon mass for the neutron star of @xmath97 was derived in ref .  .",
    "this theoretically inferred baryon number range together with the star s observed gravitational mass of @xmath98 may represent a most valuable constraint on the eos , provided the above key assumption for the formation mechanism of the pulsar b is correct.@xcite if so , any    viable eos proposed for neutron star matter must predict a baryon number in the range @xmath99 for a neutron star whose gravitational mass is @xmath100 .",
    "we may contrast this result with that of an independent calculation,@xcite where for pulsar  b a baryon mass of @xmath101 has been obtained .",
    "the authors of ref .   discussed caveats such as baryon loss and variations of the critical mass due to carbon flashes during the collapse .",
    "the effect of 1% and 2% mass loss on the usefulness of this constraint to exclude model eos is shown in fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : m_n ] .",
    "aside from neutron star masses , kilohertz quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) seen from more than 25 neutron star x - ray binaries ( lxmbs ) can be used to put additional constraints on the high - density eos .",
    "a pair of such qpos is often seen from these systems.@xcite in all currently viable models for these qpos , the higher qpo frequency is close to the orbital frequency at some special radius .",
    "for such a qpo to last the required many cycles ( up to @xmath102 in some sources ) , the orbit must be outside the star . according to general relativity theory",
    "the orbit must also be outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "gas or particles inside the isco would spiral rapidly into the star , preventing the production of sharp qpos .",
    "this implies@xcite that the observation of a source whose maximum qpo frequency is @xmath103 limits the stellar mass and radius to @xmath104 the quantity @xmath105 ( with @xmath21 the stellar angular momentum ) is the dimensionless spin parameter , which is typically in the range between 0.10 and 0.2 for these systems . equation ( [ eq : qpo ] ) implies that for given observed value @xmath103 the mass and radius of that source must be inside a wedge - shaped area , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : m - r ] .",
    "since wedge becomes smaller for higher @xmath103 , the highest frequency ever observed , 1330  hz for 4u  0614 + 091@xcite , places the strongest constraint on the eos . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : m - r ] , the current qpo constraints do not rule out any of the eos considered here .",
    "however , because higher frequencies imply smaller wedges , the future observation of a qpo with a frequency in the range of @xmath106  hz would rule out the stiffest of our eos .",
    "if there is evidence for a particular source that a given frequency is close to the orbital frequency at the isco , then the mass is known to a good accuracy , with uncertainties arising from the spin parameter .",
    "this was first claimed for 4u  182030,@xcite but complexities in the source phenomenology have made this controversial .",
    "more recently , careful analysis of rossi x - ray timing explorer data for 4u  1636536 and other sources@xcite has suggested    that sharp and reproducible changes in qpo properties are related to the isco .",
    "if so , this implies that several neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries should have gravitational masses between @xmath107 and possibly @xmath108.@xcite in fig.[eos - blaschke - fig : m - r ] we show the estimated mass of @xmath109 for 4u  1636536 .",
    "recently , mass - radius constraints have been reported for the accreting compact stars xte j1739 - 285@xcite and sax j1808.4 - 3658@xcite ( sax j1808 for short ) which are based on the identification of the burst oscillation frequency with the spin frequency of the compact star .",
    "it is almost impossible to fulfill the constraints from rx j1856 ( and other high - mass candidates ) and sax j1808 ( which favors a soft eos ) simultaneously so that the status of sax j1808 is currently controversial .",
    "it is likely that the small radius estimate of leahy et al.@xcite is a consequence of the underestimation of higher harmonics when only timing data are analyzed and not also the energy spectra.@xcite neutron star xte j1739 - 285 and its possible implications for the eos are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the nearby isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( rx j1856 for short ) belongs to a group of seven objects which show a purely thermal spectrum in x - rays and in optical - uv .",
    "this allows the determination of @xmath110 , the ratio of the photospheric radius @xmath111 to the distance @xmath112 of the object , if the radiative properties of its photosphere are known .",
    "rx j1856 is the only object of this group which has a measured distance obtained by hubble space telescope ( hst ) astrometry .",
    "after the distance of 117  pc @xcite became known several groups pointed out that the blackbody radius of this star is as large as 15 to 17  km .",
    "although both the x - ray and the optical - uv spectra are extremely well represented by blackbody functions they require different emission areas , a smaller hot spot and a larger cooler region .",
    "the overall spectrum could also be fitted by blackbody emission from a surface showing a continuous temperature distribution between a hot pole and a cool equator , as expected for a magnetized neutron star .",
    "the resulting blackbody radii are 17  km ( two blackbodies ) and 16.8  km ( continuous temperature distribution)@xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt the result of the continuous temperature fit , @xmath113 km .",
    "more recent hst observations of rx j1856 indicated larger distances of up to 178  pc .",
    "a distance of around 140  pc for rx j1856 is considered a conservative lower limit.@xcite for a distance of 140  pc the corresponding radius is 17  km.@xcite although some questions  in particular that of the distance  are not yet finally settled , the recent data support an unusually large radius for rx j1856.5 - 3754 .",
    "an additional test to the mass - radius relationship is provided by measurements of the gravitational redshift of line emissions from the surfaces of neutron stars .",
    "the gravitational redshift , @xmath114 is given in terms of the star s gravitational mass and radius according to @xmath115 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : moi ] , the dependence of @xmath114 on star mass is shown for two representative eos .",
    "the disputed measurement of @xmath116 for exo 0748 - 676@xcite allows for both an unconfined hadronic core composition as well as a deconfined quark - core composition.@xcite a measurement of @xmath117 could not be reconciled with the hybrid star models suggested here , while the hadronic model would not be invalidated by redshift measurements up to @xmath118 .",
    "the observed data of the relativistic double pulsar psr j0737 + 3039 did allow a determination of the moment of inertia ( moi)@xcite of that star , which may be used to put further constraints on the eos of neutron stars.@xcite results for the moi computed for the eos of this paper are shown in fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : moi ] . due to the fact that the mass 1.338 @xmath119 of psr j0737 + 3039 a is in the vicinity of the suggested critical mass region , the quark matter core is small and",
    "the expected    moi of the hybrid star will be practically indistinguishable from that of a pure hadronic one .",
    "the situation would improve if the moi could be measured for more massive objects , because the difference in the moi of both alternative models for masses as high as @xmath120 could reach the @xmath121 accuracy level .",
    "an absolute upper limit on the spin frequency of a pulsar is given by the mass shedding limit , at which the velocity of the stellar surface equals that of an orbiting particle suspended just above the surface . for a rigid newtonian sphere",
    "this frequency is given by the keplerian frequency,@xcite @xmath122 this formula was found to describe the mass shedding points for a sample of neutron star eos extremely well.@xcite however , both deformation and general relativistic effects are very important so that eq.([eos - blaschke - nu_k ] ) needs to be modified",
    ". it has been found@xcite that with a coefficient of 1045 hz , eq.([eos - blaschke - nu_k ] ) approximately describes the maximum rotation rate for a star of mass @xmath123 and non - rotating radius @xmath84 , independently of the eos .",
    "the observation of rapidly rotating pulsars can therefore constrain the compactness and might eventually lead to the elimination of eos that are too stiff , since the latter lead to stars that are too big .",
    "if the recent discovery of burst oscillations with a frequency of 1122 hz in the x - ray binary xte j1739 - 285@xcite and their identification with the star s spin frequency turns out to be correct , this object would spin at a rotational period of 0.89  ms , rendering it the first sub - millisecond pulsar ever observed , imposing severe constraints on the eos .",
    "the boundary for the mass - radius relationship reads in this case@xcite @xmath124 as can be seen from the left panel in fig .",
    "[ eos - blaschke - fig : m - r ] , this constraint would rule out all neutron stars of masses @xmath125 .",
    "only neutron stars computed for the stiffest eos of our collection ( d@xmath94c , dd - f4 , bbg and dbhf ) remain viable . in concluding this section , we mention that an important test of the transport properties of the matter inside sub - millisecond pulsars arises from the r - mode instability.@xcite this constraint on superconducting quark matter in neutron stars has recently been discussed for the putative sub - millisecond pulsar xte j1739 - 285,@xcite where it was argued that this object must be either a strange star or a quark - hadron hybrid star .    in passing we mention that rotational instabilities in rotating stars , known as gravitational radiation driven instabilities , set a more stringent limit on rapid stellar rotation than mass shedding from the equator.@xcite these instabilities originate from counter - rotating surface vibrational modes which at sufficiently high rotational star frequencies are dragged forward . in this case gravitational radiation , which inevitably accompanies the aspherical transport of matter ,",
    "does not damp the instability modes but rather drives them .",
    "viscosity plays the important role of damping these instabilities at a sufficiently reduced rotational frequency such that the viscous damping rate and power in gravity waves are comparable .",
    "the most critical instability modes that are driven unstable by gravitational radiation are the @xmath126-modes and the recently discovered @xmath12-modes.@xcite the latter may severely constrain the composition of compact stars that would rotate at sub - millisecond periods.@xcite",
    "compact stars in binary systems in general undergo during their evolution a stage with disc accretion leading to both , spin - up and mass increase .",
    "initial indications for a spin frequency clustering in low - mass x - ray binary systems , reported by measurements with the rossi - xte , have lead to the suggestion to interprete such a correlation as a waiting - point phenomenon where star configurations cross the border between pure neutron stars and hybrid stars in the spin frequency ",
    "mass plane.@xcite a systematic analysis of the critical line for a deconfinement phase transition in the phase diagram for accreting compact stars@xcite has revealed that the suggested population clustering due to the phase transition shall rather lead to a mass clustering effect .",
    "for strange stars , however , such an effect shall be absent.@xcite for generic polytropic forms of the eos of quark and hadronic matter , the relationship between softness or hardness of the eos and the structure of this phase diagram has been demonstrated in ref . .",

    ". there might be other reasons for the mass clustering of spinning pulsars,@xcite but the suggestion to relate it to a phase transition in the interior can not be excluded .",
    "if true , it would be a strong constraint for the hybrid eos and suggest a critical density for deconfinement in compact stars at about 0.4  @xmath128 ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) .",
    "we want to point out that the non - zero quark chemical potential ( @xmath130 ) domain is a rather poorly understood region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "fundamental approaches , like solving the in - medium qcd schwinger - dyson equations in a specific qcd model @xcite to obtain a quark matter eos are demanding . this well justifies the description of a quark matter phase within three - flavor njl - type models , giving access even to diquark pairing channels at reasonable expense.@xcite",
    "neutron stars cool for the first @xmath131 years through neutrino emission from their cores , which is followed at later times by photon emission .",
    "we simulate this behavior by using the cooling code developed in refs .. the cooling calculations are performed for different hadronic eos , different assumptions about superconductivity , and different stellar crust models .",
