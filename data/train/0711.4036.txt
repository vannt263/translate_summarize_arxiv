    "the study of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) bound state with faddeev method based on an angular momentum decomposition , which includes spin - isospin degrees of freedom , after truncation leads to a set of a finite number of coupled equations in two variables for the amplitudes and one needs a large number of partial waves to get converged results @xcite,@xcite . in view of this very large number of interfering terms",
    "it appears natural to give up such an expansion and work directly with vector variables . on this basis",
    "recently three- and four - body bound states have been studied in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) approach where as a simplification the spin - isospin degrees of freedoms have been neglected in the first attempt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "considering the spin - isospin is a major additional task , which will increase more degrees of freedom into the states and will lead to a strictly finite number of coupled equations . in this paper",
    "we implement this task by including the spin - isospin degrees of freedom in 3n bound state formalism .",
    "we formulate the faddeev equations with nn interactions as function of vector jacobi momenta , specifically the magnitudes of the momenta and the angles between them .",
    "we obtain a strictly finite number of coupled three - dimensional integral equations in 3 variables for the amplitudes which greatly simplifies the calculations without using a pw decomposition .",
    "we solve the coupled faddeev integral equations for calculation of triton binding energy with bonn - b potential .",
    "the input to our calculations is the two - body @xmath0-matrix which has been calculated in an approach based on a helicity representation and depends on the magnitudes of the initial and final momenta and the angle between them @xcite .",
    "the bound state of three pairwise - interacting nucleons is described by faddeev equation :    @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stands for the free hamiltonian . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two - body transition and permutation operators .",
    "the total anti - symmetrized wave function @xmath5 of 3n system is composed of three faddeev components as @xmath6 and @xmath7 guarantees that @xmath5 is totally antisymmetric . in order to solve equation ( [ eq.1 ] ) in momentum space we introduce the 3n basis states in a 3d formalism as , @xcite : @xmath8    as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) the basis states involve two standard jacobi momenta and consequently the angular dependence explicitly appears in these jacobi vector variables , whereas in a standard pw approach the angular dependence leads to two orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ". therefore we couple the spin quantum numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the total spin @xmath13 and its third component @xmath14 as : @xmath15 . for the isospin quantum numbers similar coupling scheme leads to total isospin @xmath16 . for evaluating the faddeev equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , we need to evaluate the matrix elements of two - body @xmath0-matrix and permutation operators . they have been evaluated in detail in ref . @xcite as :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are the spin - isospin part of free 3n basis states and @xmath19 are clebsch - gordan coefficients . for derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) the anti - symmetry property of the faddeev component as well as the physical representation of the two - body t - matrix @xcite are used . in order to solve this equation directly without employing pw projections ,",
    "we choose the spin polarization direction parallel to the @xmath20-axis and express the momentum vectors in this coordinate system .",
    "since the angular momentum quantum numbers do nt appear explicitly in our formalism , therefore the number of coupled equations which are fixed according to the spin - isospin states are reduced .",
    "this is an indication that the present formalism automatically consider all partial waves without any truncation on the space part . considering the spin - isospin degrees of freedom for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 states yields the same number of coupled equations and it leads to 8 , 12 , 16 and 24 coupled equations for different combinations of total spin - isospin states @xmath23 : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . in a standard pw approach",
    "the infinite set of coupled integral equations is truncated in actual calculations at sufficiently high values of angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "if one assumes that the nn @xmath0-matrix acts up to @xmath28 and @xmath29 then the number of channels will be 5 , 18 , 26 , 34 and 42 , while the total isospin is restricted to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in order to test our realistic 3d formalism for 3n bound state we solve the eight coupled faddeev three - dimensional integral equations corresponding to total spin - isospin states @xmath24 for @xmath31h case .",
    "we calculate triton binding energy with bonn one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potential in the parametrization of bonn - b @xcite and in an operator form which can be incorporated in 3d formalism @xcite .    as shown in table [ table1 ] our calculations for bonn - b nn potential in 3d",
    "approach yield the value @xmath32 $ ] for @xmath31h binding energy , which is in good agreement with the converged value @xmath33 $ ] of faddeev calculations in pw scheme for @xmath34 . as we can see from this comparison our result provide the same accuracy while the numerical procedure is actually easier to implement ."
