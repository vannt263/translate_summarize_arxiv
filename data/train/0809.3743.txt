    "transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) for inclusive single - particle production in polarized high - energy proton ",
    "proton collisions have historically motivated a huge theoretical and experimental effort to understand the role of spin and intrinsic parton motion in hadronic processes ( see ref .  [ ] for an up - to - date review ) . at present , other asymmetries are experimentally at reach for meson production in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , in the drell - yan ( dy ) process , or in inclusive two - particle production in proton  proton collisions , which are considered safer from a theoretical point of view . many leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries can be studied for such processes , in a context where factorization has been proven and some universality issues for the soft , transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) functions involved , like the sivers distribution and the collins fragmentation function ( ff ) , have been clarified . the interplay among different theoretical models ( the collinear twist - three formalism  [ ] and tmd approaches )",
    "has also been analyzed , at least for some kinematical regimes .",
    "ssa s in inclusive single - particle production in hadronic collisions look more involved .",
    "being twist - three effects , several competing mechanisms may contribute .",
    "factorization holds in the collinear twist - three approach  [ ] ; however , in phenomenological applications , leading order ( lo ) unpolarized cross sections are used , which often underestimate experimental data . on the other hand",
    ", factorization has never been proven for tmd approaches , and has to be assumed . other open points concern the universality properties of the tmd functions .",
    "nevertheless , the study of ssa s in @xmath1 processes is still very important and useful . together with the well - known fixed target results of the fermilab - e704 collaboration , an increasing amount of challenging high - energy experimental data are becoming available from rhic experiments , with enlarged statistics and kinematical coverage . at this stage ,",
    "a combined phenomenological analysis of these results with sidis and @xmath2 data can give crucial information on the universality properties of the sivers and collins functions and on possible factorization - breaking terms in hadronic collisions in the kinematical regimes experimentally accessible .",
    "in our phenomenological analysis we adopt an lo pqcd approach including spin and intrinsic motion ( @xmath3 ) effects and all leading - twist polarized tmd distribution and fragmentation functions , which keep their simple partonic interpretation  [ ] .",
    "the complete @xmath3 kinematics is included also in the partonic cross sections . as already mentioned , for this approach factorization has not been proven yet , and has to be considered as a reasonable assumption deserving careful phenomenological tests .",
    "the same is true for the ( assumed ) universality of the tmd functions involved .    in the context of the generalized parton model and the helicity formalism the polarized differential cross section for the inclusive process @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are two spin-1/2 hadrons ( _ e.g. _ two protons ) and @xmath7 an unpolarized particle ( _ e.g. _ a meson or a photon ) , reads schematically ( see ref .  [ ] for details ) : @xmath8 when summing over all partons and their helicities , all allowed combinations of tmd pdfs@xmath9ffs@xmath9polarized partonic cross sections appear  [ ] . by taking appropriate sums and differences of these cross sections ( with @xmath10 or @xmath11 changing sign )",
    "all spin asymmetries can be written down .",
    "as an example , the transverse ssa , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "notice that for the single - particle production case considered here , keeping at least the dominant @xmath3 dependence in the partonic cross sections is crucial in order to get a non - vanishing ssa ( this is not the case for double spin asymmetries ) .",
    "this also explains why , although involving leading - twist tmd pdf s and ff s , the global effect is higher - twist in @xmath15 .",
    "again , this is not the case for inclusive double - particle production , where an observed low - energy scale is present ( _ e.g. _ the unbalanced two - particle total transverse momentum ) .",
    "we recently realized that a sign mistake was present in our calculation of the ssa s in hadronic collisions in the @xmath17 channel contribution to the collins mechanism ( see also ref .",
    "this induced strong cancelations among the dominant partonic channels at large @xmath18 , leading , together with non trivial effects due to azimuthal phase integrations , to a sizeable suppression of the collins effect and a potential dominance of the sivers contribution  [ ] . after correction",
    "this conclusion gets substantial change .",
    "although the role of azimuthal phases is confirmed , for e704 and rhic kinematics the collins effect is not strongly suppressed anymore .",
    "therefore , it can play a substantial role and mix with the sivers mechanism .",
    "let us however stress that the corrected sign mistake _ plays no role _ in several phenomenological analyses recently performed by our group  ( see ref .",
    "[ ] and refs . therein ) . in particular , there is no change for : 1 ) the sivers asymmetry in @xmath19 and in the drell - yan process , and for the @xmath20 transverse polarization in unpolarized hadronic collisions ; 2 ) the azimuthal sivers and collins asymmetries in sidis processes ( no gluonic channel is involved at lo ) ; 3 ) the gluon sivers effect in @xmath21 at rhic energies .",
    "furthermore , there are practically no changes for the bounds on the gluon sivers function recently derived from the rhic - phenix @xmath22 data at mid - rapidity .    in the rest of this section we will present a selection of the most significant variations in the phenomenological analyses which _ are _ affected by this correction ( an extended and comprehensive paper is in progress ) .",
    "the old results were obtained with parameterizations for the tmd pdf s and ff s which are not at present the most updated ones . in order to avoid confusion , and to clearly show the effect of the correction , we will present results using _ exactly _ the same choices adopted in the original calculations .",
    "an analysis of the collins effect in @xmath16 collisions with the most up - to - date parameterizations is also in progress .",
    "some preliminary results will be discussed in the next section . in ref .",
    "[ ] we have considered the maximized contribution of the collins mechanism to the transverse ssa for the process @xmath23 in the kinematical configurations of the e704 and star experiments .    in fig .",
    "[ coll - fig - e704 ] we compare the results for the e704 kinematics obtained before and after correction of the collins contribution .",
    "although the significant role of azimuthal phases in depleting the contribution at medium - large @xmath18 is confirmed , the suppression of the collins effect at large @xmath18 is significantly reduced .",
    "notice , however , that the plots show the maximized potential effect , with all partonic contributions saturated and added with the same sign .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "[ coll - fig - star ] we compare results , before ( ref .  [ ] ) and after correction , for the sivers and collins contributions to the @xmath24 ssa at the rhic - star kinematics .",
    "different maximized contributions are shown separately ( quark sivers , gluon sivers and transversity@xmath9collins terms ) . again , after correction the suppression of the maximized potential collins contribution to the ssa is sizeably reduced at large @xmath18 ( sivers terms are clearly unaffected ) .    in a recent paper  [ ] ,",
    "some of us have shown how predictions in very good agreement with rhic data for pion ssa s can be obtained by using the central values of the parameterizations for the sivers  [ ] and transversity distributions and the collins function  [ ] then available from fits to the sidis and @xmath2 data . while the agreement with star data for @xmath25 is still good ( see left plot in fig .",
    "[ newfits - star ] ) , fig .",
    "[ coll - fig - uni ] shows how for brahms measurements our corrected predictions overestimate the data , somehow weakening the conclusions reached in ref .",
    "[ ] .    in conclusion , there is indeed a significant reduction of the collins mechanism due to azimuthal phase factors . after correction , however , this effect alone is not sufficient to rule out sizeable collins contributions to meson ssa s in @xmath16 collisions , at least for the e704 and rhic kinematics .",
    "therefore , and in contrast with ref .",
    "[ ] , we can not exclude a more complicated ( but even more interesting ) situation in which both sivers and collins effects may potentially give significant and comparable contributions to single - particle ssa s in hadronic collisions .",
    "the analysis of the previous section was performed exactly in the same conditions as in the original papers . in the meantime both the amount and the precision of experimental data have significantly increased . moreover , a new set of meson fragmentation functions , the dss set , has become available  [ ] which was obtained by including in the fit unpolarized cross sections and multiplicities for meson production in @xmath16 collisions and in sidis .",
    "this set has a much larger @xmath27 quark component for kaon ff s and a much larger lo gluon component than previous sets , for both pions and kaons .    the available sidis experimental data probe a ( relatively ) limited region of the bjorken variable , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 )",
    ". the parameterizations of the tmd distributions involved are therefore almost unconstrained at large light - cone momentum fractions .",
    "this implies large uncertainties in the predictions for ssa s in @xmath16 collisions at large positive @xmath18 .",
    "the new high - precision belle data put instead more stringent constraints on the collins ff . the latest hermes data on kaon ssa s are challenging , since positive kaons have on the average larger sivers asymmetries than positive pions .",
    "this is difficult to understand in the simplified valence - like scenario adopted in the previous fits .",
    "therefore , we have recently performed  [ ] a new fitting procedure for quark and , for the first time , sea - quark sivers functions , using the dss set and optimizing some parameters in order to : a ) maximize the sensitivity in the @xmath28 region covered by the hermes and compass results ; b ) describe well the kaon data .",
    "a new preliminary parameterization of the transversity and collins functions , using the new sidis and @xmath2 data is also available  [ ] .",
    "details and features of the new fits and parameterizations have been already presented in this workshop ( see the contributions of m.  boglione and a.  prokudin ) . in figs .",
    "[ newfits - star ] and [ newfits - brahms ] we compare predictions for pion ssa s in @xmath16 collisions at rhic , using the corrected collins contribution and the central - value parameterizations of the sivers , collins and transversity functions as obtained respectively in the previous ( left plots ) and in the new ( right plots ) fits .",
    "the results for star kinematics look much worse with the new fits , which however seem to reconcile ( after correction of the collins contribution ) our predictions with the brahms results ( see fig .",
    "[ coll - fig - uni ] ) .",
    "these preliminary results must be taken with great care .",
    "as already discussed , sidis results do not constrain the large @xmath30 behaviour of the tmd distributions . as a consequence , predictions for ssa s at large",
    "@xmath28 or @xmath18 can be affected by huge uncertainties .",
    "they can also be strongly dependent on simplifying assumptions ( necessary to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit ) involving the parameters governing this large @xmath30 behaviour . in the new fits  [ ] , in the effort to probe the role of sea quarks in detail",
    ", we adopted the same large @xmath30 behaviour for all sivers distributions .",
    "this is at variance with the old valence - like fits  [ ] , where the large @xmath30 behaviour of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quark sivers functions were left totally independent .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ newfits - star ] clearly show that in order to have a sizable sivers ssa at large @xmath18 , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quark sivers functions _ can not _ have the same large @xmath30 behaviour .",
    "notice that this is not in contradiction with the results of the new fits , since present sidis data are basically unaffected by these details .",
    "concerning the collins contribution , it is indeed bigger after correction .",
    "however , for neutral pion production large cancelations between the leading and non - leading collins functions ( which result with opposite signs from the fits ) prevent it to be very large .",
    "let us also remark that the huge lo gluon component of the dss set gives a large contribution to the denominator of the ssa but almost no contribution to its numerator ( dominated by quark initiated terms ) .",
    "this discussion allows us to understand the preliminary results of figs .",
    "[ newfits - star ] and [ newfits - brahms ] .",
    "clearly , in order to better investigate the possibility of simultaneously explain sidis and @xmath16 data on meson ssa s with a universal set of tmd functions , we need to perform , in the lack of experimental sidis data at large @xmath28 , a more detailed analysis .",
    "this is in progress and will be presented elsewhere ."
