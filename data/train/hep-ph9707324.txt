    "the study of topological or vacuum defects is of importance in many areas of contemporary physics . in high energy physics ,",
    "a defect will generically occur during a symmetry breaking process where different parts of a medium choose different vacuum energy configurations , and the non - compatibility of these different vacua forces a sheet , line , or point of energy where these non - compatible vacua meet .",
    "the relevant vacuum order parameter then becomes indeterminate  this is the defect .",
    "a defect may be topological  @xcite , in that it is the topology of the vacuum that simultaneously allows formation , and prevents dissipation , of these objects  but other types of defect are also possible .",
    "for instance , a defect may be stable dynamically ( i.e.  classically , due to energy considerations ) but not topologically , as it happens for semilocal @xcite or electroweak @xcite defects .",
    "a defect can even be ` topological ' and unstable , as in the case of textures  @xcite , but nonetheless of physical importance .",
    "in cosmology , there has been much speculation that topological defects ( stable or otherwise ) might have played an important role in structure formation  @xcite . in general",
    ", there are two main concerns when considering the cosmological effects of topological defects : their gravitational effects and their dynamics .",
    "any theory concerning galaxy formation must be able to allow or constrain the presence of strongly self - gravitating objects .",
    "but the dynamics of the defects are in fact even more important , for it is the dynamics that determine to a large extent the shapes of the gravitating defects .",
    "for instance , if cosmic strings did not intercommute , any network would rapidly become tangled and would not obey a scaling law ; such a configuration would be in conflict with the universe we see around us today .",
    "even with intercommutation  @xcite , strings which are strongly rigid and hence straight will have different gravitational effects to those that are very crinkly  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of a defect is generally assumed to be approximated by an effective action , a description which models the rather large numbers of degrees of freedom of the full field theory by the smaller number of degrees of freedom based on the position of the core of the defect .",
    "attempts to derive effective actions or equations of motion for topological defects have commonly focussed on the strong coupling limit , meaning that of large values of the coupling coefficient @xmath0 of the relevant higgs field . in this limit , the defect becomes infinitesimally thin and effectively decouples from the other ( infinitely massive ) particles in the field theory .",
    "the study of the effective motion of topological defects has been extended  @xcite away from the limit @xmath1 to cases for which the thickness is small but not exactly zero .",
    "the resultant effective action generically contains a ` zero - thickness ' term proportional to the area of the defect  @xcite , and extrinsic curvature terms which appear at quadratic order in the thickness  @xcite .",
    "the exact form of these second order terms is dependent on whether an ` off - shell ' or ` on - shell ' approach has been used to derive the effective action as was explained using the example of the domain wall in  @xcite , and one finds that in a self - consistent order by order solution of the equations of motion , the only quadratic correction appearing is due to the geometry of the defect worldsurface , and is proportional to its intrinsic ricci curvature  @xcite . for the domain wall , this term gives corrections to the motion , however for the string this term is a topological invariant ",
    "proportional to the euler character of the worldsheet  and hence does not give any correction to the nambu equations of motion .",
    "the leading order corrections to the motion of a cosmic string were shown by one of us , @xcite , to appear at quartic order in the string width . in this paper , a systematic expansion of the geometry and field equations clarified an earlier discrepancy concerning second order ` twist ' terms  @xcite , and derived the fourth order action of the string , which is @xmath2 ,        \\label{anderson}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the ricci and extrinsic curvatures of the worldsheet ( to be defined in the next section ) , and the @xmath5 are numerical coefficients depending on the field theory modelling the vortex ( to be defined in section  [ sec : correct ] for the abelian - higgs model ) . unlike the domain wall ,",
    "whose background solution , and extrinsic curvature corrections can be expressed analytically  @xcite , the prototypical cosmic string solution , the nielsen  olesen vortex  @xcite , does not have a closed analytic form , hence these coefficients must be evaluated numerically .",
    "as soon as one calculates corrections to the nambu action , it becomes of general concern whether or not these corrections cause the motion of the defect to be ` rigid ' or ` antirigid . '",
    "the implications of extrinsic curvature terms for string motion have been well - explored  @xcite , however , it is not always easy to decide _ a priori _ ( especially for the fourth order terms ) whether the strings will be rigid or not , or indeed what one means by rigid  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we address these issues .",
    "we determine the numerical values of the @xmath5 for the abelian - higgs model by solving the perturbed field equations for the non - flat worldsheet .",
    "we then derive the fourth order equations of motion from anderson s action and calculate corrections to three ` test case ' trajectories : the circular loop , the travelling wave , and the helical breather .",
    "these three solutions display different characteristics which should be mirrored in the corrections to the nambu motion if the rigidity of the string is to be determined .",
    "the loop collapses to a point  @xcite , and rigidity would be indicated by a retardation of this collapse .",
    "a travelling wave on the other hand has been shown to be an exact solution of the full field theory  @xcite , and should not exhibit any corrections if our approach is to be trusted . the helical breather",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) is a time dependent solution which is never singular .",
    "rigidity for this trajectory is more subtle , since the helical breather is never singular , however , we could call the string rigid if the tendency of the correction is to lower the magnitude of the scalar curvature of the worldsheet . as we will see , it is rather difficult to give an intuitive criterion for rigidity .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section we review the formalism for the derivation of the effective action . in section  [ sec : correct ] we rederive anderson s action , and present new numerical results evaluating the coefficients appearing in the action . in section  [ sec : eom ] we derive the equations of motion of the fourth order string , and in section  [ sec : traj ] we calculate corrections to three test trajectories . in section  [ sec : rigid ] we discuss the question of rigidity and conclude .",
    "in this section we review the formalism required for the derivation of the string effective action .",
    "this formalism is largely based on the contents of  @xcite .",
    "the problem of building the effective action is to reduce some four - dimensional field theoretic action integral @xmath6 to some two - dimensional worldsheet integral @xmath7 we follow the canonical approach by setting up a coordinate system based on the worldsheet , and expanding the action and equations of motion around this worldsheet . by `",
    "expand ' we mean that we do not expect in one go to be able to solve the full equations of motion and integrate out ( otherwise why find an effective action ) but that we will be able to express the equations of motion for the system in terms of an expansion in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radius of the string , and @xmath10 a typical scale of the extrinsic curvature of the worldsheet .",
    "we then solve the equations of motion in the directions perpendicular to the worldsheet , and integrate out the four - dimensional action  ( [ actfour ] ) over these degrees of freedom to get an action of the form  ( [ actwo ] ) .",
    "we will look at the particular case of a u(1 ) local string in flat spacetime ( signature @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is a vortex solution of the abelian - higgs model @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the usual gauge covariant derivative , and @xmath14 the field strength associated with @xmath15 .",
    "we rewrite the field content of this model in the usual way :    [ changevar ] @xmath16 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that the vacuum is characterised by @xmath17 . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is now the field strength of @xmath20 . by making a compensating gauge transformation in @xmath15 ,",
    "we have absorbed the unphysical gauge degree of freedom of the theory . for future reference , here are the equations of motion for the new fields :    [ eomxp ] @xmath21    these equations are known to admit vortex solutions , the best known being that due to nielsen and olesen  @xcite  a solution corresponding to an infinite straight static string .",
    "a vortex solution is characterised by the fact that the scalar field phase has a non - zero winding number around an axis corresponding to the zeroes of the higgs field ( x=0 ) .",
    "if we choose the string axis to be aligned with the @xmath22-axis , then a gauge can be chosen in which the vortex solution takes the form @xmath23      \\nabla_\\mu \\theta\\ ] ] in cylindrical polar coordinates , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy the ( generically ) second order coupled differential equations :    [ no ] @xmath26    and we have introduced the bogomolnyi parameter @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the global string , and @xmath29 is the critical ( supersymmetric ) string for which the equations of motion factor to two coupled first order equations :    @xmath30    intuitively we expect the solution for a general worldsheet to be very close to the nielsen ",
    "olesen solution in suitable coordinates , and that we might be able to expand the fields , and therefore the action , around this approximate solution .",
    "let us now try to make this idea more concrete .",
    "first we choose a worldsheet - based coordinate system .",
    "( note this will only be valid within the radii of curvature of the worldsheet . )",
    "we start by coordinatising the worldsheet by @xmath31 and @xmath32 as usual .",
    "since we are in flat space , at each point on the worldsheet we have a well defined orthogonal flat two - plane , and such orthogonal planes do not intersect within the radii of curvature of the worldsheet .",
    "thus we can thicken the worldsheet to a worldblanket by defining @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be constant on such orthogonal planes .",
    "since the worldsheet @xmath33 has codimension 2 , it has two associated families of unit normals @xmath34 .",
    "we choose a cartesian parametrisation of the orthogonal planes such that @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath36 define a coordinate system in the vicinity of the worldsheet .",
    "in general it will not be possible to choose this system to be globally orthogonal , however , we will assume that the normal fields have been chosen so that the departure from orthogonality is minimal , i.e. of order of the extrinsic curvature of the worldsheet .    because we no longer have a flat coordinate system ,",
    "the connection will no longer be trivial , although the curvature components should still vanish . in order to examine the form of these relations , we use a gauss ",
    "codazzi approach  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for more of a physicist s approach ) . for shorthand",
    "we denote by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) the coordinates @xmath39 , the worldsheet by @xmath33 and the minkowski spacetime by @xmath40 .",
    "the _ first fundamental form _ @xmath41 of @xmath33 is defined as @xmath42 the tensor @xmath41 acts as a projector onto @xmath33 , but is still a tensor in the 4-dimensional spacetime . for the metric _ intrinsic _ to the worldsheet",
    ", one uses the familiar @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the spacetime coordinates of the submanifold @xmath33 .",
    "this gives an interpretation of @xmath33 as both a worldsheet in spacetime and a two - dimensional manifold with its own intrinsic geometry .",
    "one can define the intrinsic curvature of @xmath33 in the standard way , and the extrinsic curvatures , or _",
    "second fundamental forms _ , by @xmath45 these extrinsic curvatures @xmath4 measure how @xmath33 curves in @xmath40 .",
    "since the codimension of the worldsheet is greater than one , we also have a non - trivial _ normal fundamental form _",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47 is the alternating symbol on two indices .",
    "this represents how near to orthogonality the worldblanket coordinate system is ; it measures the rotation of the @xmath48 in their own planes as one moves around the worldsheet .",
    "note that , despite lying tangent to @xmath33 , @xmath49 is a gauge dependent object , depending on the choice of the normal fields ",
    "an so(2 ) gauge group .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 is the connection on the normal bundle of @xmath33 .",
    "now , we may write @xmath50 where the symmetrization is understood to be only acting on indices of the same type , so that the ` @xmath51 ' above does not participate in any symmetrization . this now indicates an alternative definition of the second fundamental forms : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the lie derivative with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "we may now use the riemann identity in flat space to derive the following relation for the extrinsic curvatures : @xmath54 therefore , contracting with @xmath55 gives @xmath56 in addition , note that @xmath57 and @xmath58    the system of equations  ( [ altk][lien ] ) give the ` equations of motion ' for the geometry of the system , which together with  ( [ eomxp ] ) form the full equations of motion for the string .    in order to extract a low energy effective action , we will need to expand these quantities and equations of motion in terms of the thickness of the string , @xmath9 . to do this",
    "systematically we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents a typical radius of curvature of the worldsheet .",
    "we then define the _ zero thickness limit _ to mean @xmath62 with @xmath63 , the energy per unit length of the string , fixed .",
    "note that this may not necessarily mean that the string width _ is _ zero , since instead the extrinsic curvature could be zero ( a flat worldsheet ) .",
    "however , if @xmath64 , this limit corresponds to the conventional @xmath65 limit .",
    "we now redefine coordinates so that the worldsheet has thickness and curvature of order unity by setting    [ rescale ] @xmath66    and redefining for consistency the following variables    [ redefine ] @xmath67    the worldsheet geometry equations  ( [ altk][liebeta ] ) become    [ unitgeom ] @xmath68 \\\\      { \\cal l}_j k_{_i\\mu\\nu } & = & \\epsilon k_{_i\\sigma(\\mu } k_{_j\\nu)}^\\sigma \\\\      { \\cal l}_j k_{_i } & = & - \\epsilon k_{_i\\mu\\nu}k_{_j}^{\\mu\\nu } \\\\      { \\cal l}_j \\omega_\\mu & = & 0 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the field equations  ( [ eomxp ] ) become : @xmath69 \\bigg\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   & & = { \\hat p}_\\mu { \\hat p}_\\nu g^{\\mu\\nu}x - { \\frac12 } x(x^2 - 1 ) \\label{xorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 \\bigg\\ } + \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\epsilon \\ , \\partial_a \\bigg\\ { \\sqrt{-g } \\bigg [ g^{ak}g^{jl }      { \\hat f}_{kl } + ( g^{ak}g^{jb } - g^{ab}g^{jk } )      ( \\partial_k { \\hat p}_b - \\epsilon \\partial_b      { \\hat p}_k ) + \\epsilon g^{ab } g^{jc } { \\hat f}_{bc } \\bigg ] \\bigg\\ }      \\bbox{\\bigg ) } \\nonumber \\\\    & & = -\\beta x^2 ( g^{ij } { \\hat p}_i + g^{ja}{\\hat p}_a ) \\label{piorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath71 \\bigg\\ } + \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\epsilon \\ , \\partial_b \\bigg\\ { \\sqrt{-g } \\bigg [      g^{bk}g^{al } { \\hat f}_{kl } +      ( g^{bc}g^{al } - g^{bl}g^{ac})(\\epsilon\\partial_c{\\hat p}_l      -\\partial_l{\\hat p}_c ) +   \\epsilon g^{bc}g^{ad }      { \\hat f}_{cd } \\bigg ] \\bigg\\ } \\bbox{\\biggr ) } \\nonumber \\\\    & & = -\\beta x^2 ( g^{ja}{\\hat p}_j + g^{ab}{\\hat p}_b ) .",

    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "we first consider the @xmath75 limit , with the metric and fundamental forms taking their geometrically defined values on the worldsheet .",
    "since @xmath75 is also the flat worldsheet limit , we expect that the fields will take the nielsen ",
    "olesen form , which indeed turns out to be the case . in the next section",
    "we will go to higher orders in @xmath59 , deriving the corrections to the geometry and fields , and hence the corresponding effective action .",
    "however , for the moment we conclude this section by proving that the nielsen ",
    "olesen solution is in fact the leading order behaviour for the vortex fields around the worldsheet .    to zeroth order @xmath76",
    "hence all geometrical quantities take their worldsheet values , @xmath77 etc .",
    "hence @xmath78 and thus the equations of motion for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are    [ xpzero ] @xmath81    these are solved by the nielsen ",
    "olesen solution , which is plotted in figure  [ fig : no ] against @xmath82 for @xmath29 : @xmath83    substitution of this solution back into  ( [ actfour ] ) yields the familiar nambu action .",
    "it is the corrections to this action we are interested in .",
    "we now derive the leading order corrections to the nambu action . in order to calculate quantities away from the worldsheet , such as the metric",
    ", we must perform a taylor expansion off the worldsheet @xmath84 however , in calculating the lie derivatives of the metric and its determinant some fortuitous cancellations occur . first note that @xmath85 and also that @xmath86 which follows from a trace identity for the @xmath87 matrix @xmath88  @xcite . hence to all orders , the metric and the volume jacobian are given by    @xmath89.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this gives all the information on the geometrical contributions to the action .",
    "now let us turn to the field theoretic contributions .",
    "first note that since @xmath90 vanishes by the equations of motion , first order field corrections contribute at second order in the action , and second order corrections at fourth order .",
    "to first order we may read off the equations for the corrections to the fields as    [ first ] @xmath91    the first two equations do not apparently lend themselves to a straightforward solution , however , we note that the equation of motion for the worldsheet obtained by varying the nambu action is @xmath92 which would indicate that the ` driving ' terms in  ( [ first_a ] , [ first_b ] ) vanish and hence the appropriate solution is @xmath93 . indeed , @xcite demonstrated that unless the trace of the extrinsic curvature vanished on the defect , the first order perturbation equations have no solution that is regular and bounded .",
    "thus in fact the appropriate solutions to the first two equations of ( [ first ] ) are @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the last equation of  ( [ first ] ) is solved by  @xcite @xmath96 the presence of this term , as pointed out in  @xcite , guarantees the gauge invariance of the effective action to worldsheet so(2 ) gauge transformations , for on substituting in the form of the fields , this correction to @xmath97 exactly cancels the ` twist ' terms of maeda and turok , and we arrive at the second order result    [ firstact ] @xmath98    where    [ fcoeff ] @xmath99    for the fourth order action we need the second order corrections to the fields , the volume factor already being exact to all orders . from  ( [ xorder][paorder ] )",
    "we may read off the equations for these as    [ xpsecond ] @xmath100    to simplify these , and to remove the explicit @xmath88-dependence we will decompose in cylindrical harmonics by setting    [ secondh ] @xmath101    where @xmath102 this gives two sets of coupled second order differential equations    [ zerohh ] @xmath103    and    [ secondeq ] @xmath104    there are no additional corrections to @xmath97 at this level .    in the critical case @xmath29",

    "this ` loop rigidity parameter ' is plotted against @xmath118 on figure  [ fig : rigidity ] , and its negativity means that the loop is antirigid and tends to collapse faster than in the nambu approximation .",

    "now note that while the frequency of oscillation is decreased by the same amount , and the higher frequency term is still the same , the amplitude is now uniformly increased for all @xmath118 . if , as before , we take @xmath29 , we now find @xmath225,\\ ] ] in other words an _ increase _ in the amplitude of oscillation accompanies a similar decrease in its frequency .",
    "one can not immediately see from this solution whether or not the behaviour is rigid , however , an analysis of the ricci curvature near @xmath226 shows that it is in fact increased  a behaviour consistent with antirigidity ! a calculation of the dependence of the curvature on general @xmath164 is presented in the appendix . the algebra is more complicated but the results are the same : all helical breathers display both rigid and antirigid characteristics .",
    "the results of our helical breather calculations therefore appear rather ambiguous .",
    "if we wish to identify rigidity by the behaviour of a corrected trajectory  whether it increases or decreases curvature  we are forced to calculate the effect on the curvature ( see appendix ) and then the results appear to depend on the initial conditions .",
    "what this shows is that the ` decrease in curvature ' criterion for rigidity is too nave to be reliably applied in all situations .",
    "we now want to determine whether a string can be labelled ` rigid ' or ` antirigid ' . to do this",
    ", we use an argument based in that of polyakov  @xcite , which consists in determining how the action varies under a rescaling of the spacetime coordinates @xmath227 .",
    "such transformations alter the scale of crinkles of the worldsheet and magnify or reduce small - scale structure , hence rigidity would be indicated by a extremum of the energy or the action with respect to the rescaling parameter @xmath0 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rescale ] .",
    "out starting point is the action  ( [ fourth ] ) , which can be written @xmath228 where the matrix @xmath229 is defined as @xmath230    as @xmath231 , this can be expressed as @xmath232,\\ ] ] with @xmath233 the area of the worldsheet for the range of @xmath234 being integrated over and @xmath235 proportional to the euler character of @xmath33 . also ,    @xmath236    we now rescale @xmath227 , so that for @xmath237 the worldsheet is expanded and for @xmath238 it is shrunk . then ,    @xmath239    and thus @xmath240 , @xmath241 .",

    ", we can work in the conformal gauge , @xmath249 , and we find @xmath250 if we impose the nambu equations of motion , @xmath251 , this determinant is strictly negative .",
    "hence , since @xmath252 is positive , we see that @xmath242 is unbounded , because the the coefficients multiplying @xmath253 and @xmath254 have opposite signs .",
    "we must therefore conclude that the string is antirigid .",
    "this does not mean that _ all _ the trajectories of the string exhibit antirigidity , but rather that it is impossible for all trajectories to be rigid .",
    "let us illustrate this by considering the trajectories of the previous section .",
    "for the collapsing loop , @xmath255 , and as we noticed , @xmath256 determines alone the shape of @xmath242 .",
    "this simplification came from the fact that the loop is flat , and therefore has only one nonvanishing extrinsic curvature .    for",
    "the travelling wave , @xmath257 , which is consistent with our observation of no corrections to this trajectory .    in the case of the helical breather , both @xmath258 and @xmath248 are non - zero , so we do not expect results to depend on @xmath184 . even though the action is unstable to the scaling of the worldsheet",
    ", what is happening with the helical breather is that the correction does not always have a non - zero projection on this unstable mode .",
    "however , we would expect a general correction of the breather to exhibit an instability .    to sum up :",
    "we have reviewed the derivation of the effective action for a u(1 ) local cosmic string to fourth order in the ratio of string width to worldsheet curvature .",
    "we presented numerical results calculating the coefficients of these fourth order terms .",
    "we then derived the equations of motion for the string to fourth order , and calculated corrections to a sample of well - known trajectories .",
    "we have given a general argument for antirigidity of the cosmic string to fourth order , however by reference to our examples have shown that not all trajectories need behave in an ` antirigid ' fashion  rigidity it appears is rather like a theorem , it may work in special cases , but one needs only find a single counterexample to disprove it .",
