    "exclusive reactions induced at high momentum transfer in few body systems provide us with an original way to study the production and propagation of hadrons in cold nuclear matter . in very well defined parts of the phase space ,",
    "the reaction amplitude develops a logarithmic singularity which enhances the cross section . here",
    ", the reaction amplitude is on solid ground since it depends only on on - shell elementary amplitudes and on low momentum components of the nuclear wave function  @xcite . on the one hand",
    "this allows the determination of the scattering cross section of short lived particles . on the other hand",
    "this allows the study of the propagation of exotic configurations such as the onset of color transparency .",
    "the concept of color transparency follows from the underlying structure of qcd : interactions between `` white '' objects depend on their transverse size  @xcite . a hard scattering of the probe produces recoiling particles with small transverse size , whose",
    "the subsequent interactions in nuclear matter are reduced .",
    "there is no doubt that color transparency should occur .",
    "the question is where and when .",
    "the difficulty resides in the fact that such an exotic configuration evolves quickly toward the asymptotic state of the detected hadron : in order to observe color transparency , the characteristic scale of this evolution should be larger , or comparable , to the size of the largest nuclei .    to date there is no convincing evidence for color transparency in photon and electron induced reactions .",
    "the reason is that most of the attempts were performed in semi - exclusive kinematics . in the a(e , ep )",
    "reactions  @xcite for instance , it is very likely that the values of the only available hard scale , @xmath0 , are too low to observe color transparency in the quasi - free kinematics channels , where the energy of the ejected nucleon @xmath1 and the photon four - momentum are not independent ( @xmath2 ) . in the range of values of @xmath0 accessible today , the life time of the small object is of the order of the distance between nucleons rather than the nuclear radius . for instance , at the highest @xmath3 gev@xmath4 where data exist , the energy of the outgoing proton is only 3 gev and its characteristic evolution distance  , with @xmath5  gev@xmath4 . when @xmath6  gev , one gets @xmath7  fm ] is no more than 1.5 fm , closer to the internucleonic distance rather than the size of the nucleus .    a signal has been reported in a(e , e@xmath8 ) reactions , at fermi lab .",
    "@xcite and desy  @xcite .",
    "however , it comes from a subtle interplay between the attenuation of the hadronic component of the virtual photon in the entrance channel and the onset of color transparency in the exit channel ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an experiment  @xcite has been completed recently at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) to disentangle these two effects : one has to wait the final analysis for a more definite answer .",
    "the way to overcome these difficulties is to study reactions induced by photons in few body systems : exclusive reactions allow the formation length of the hadron to be adjusted to the distance between nucleons  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics should be chosen so that the interactions of the emerging hadron with a second nucleon are maximal .",
    "this occurs when the produced hadron propagates on - shell and rescatters on a second nucleon at rest ( triangular logarithmic singularity ) . a clear signal for color transparency would be the suppression of the final state interaction peak when the momentum transfer increases",
    "this situation is more comfortable than in the more classical study of quasi elastic scattering of electrons from heavy nuclei , where one looks for a change of a flat level of attenuation of the outgoing nucleon , instead of the evolution of a well defined peak .",
    "this conjecture  @xcite has been tested in two studies of the @xmath4h@xmath9 reaction that have been completed recently at jlab : the first  @xcite with two magnetic spectrometers in hall a ; the second  @xcite with the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer  @xcite ( clas ) in hall b. the preliminary results do not exhibit a signal of color transparency ( within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties ) in the range @xmath10  gev@xmath4 , when compared to the latest prediction  @xcite of the various interaction mechanisms .",
    "it may occur earlier in exclusive photo - production of mesons .",
    "the reason is that mesons are made up of two quarks .",
    "they may recombine more easily , through the exchange of one hard gluon only , and prepare a configuration with a small transverse extension which further evolves toward its asymptotic size .",
    "the second reason is that the hard scale is provided by the four momentum transfer @xmath11 which happens to define the interaction volume , while the virtuality @xmath0 of the photon that is exchanged in @xmath12 reactions defines the scale of observation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a hint has been reported in the @xmath13he(@xmath14,p@xmath15 ) and @xmath16o(@xmath14,p@xmath15 ) channels recently studied at jlab  @xcite . however , the signal is weak and again these are semi exclusive reactions .",
    "the signal must be confirmed by completely exclusive measurements .",
    "[ pi1 ]    the simplest example is the reaction @xmath4h@xmath17 in the energy range @xmath18 gev . for real photons",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath11 , between the incoming photon and the outgoing pion , sets the size of the interaction volume . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pi1 ] , the on shell rescattering peaks corresponding to @xmath19 or @xmath20 interactions are clearly separated .",
    "such a logarithmic singularity has already been observed at lower energies  @xcite . at the top of each peak , the rescattering amplitude is dominated by low momentum components of the deuteron wave function and on mass shell elementary reaction amplitudes ( see ref .",
    "the elementary reaction @xmath21 is well reproduced by a model based on the exchange of saturating regge trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22-nucleon , as well as the nucleon - nucleon , elementary scattering amplitudes are almost entirely absorptive , and well under control at high energy  @xcite .",
    "the rescattering amplitudes are therefore on solid grounds  @xcite : the method can be calibrated at low values of the four momentum transfer @xmath11 .",
    "a signal of color transparency would be the reduction of the @xmath19 rescattering peak when @xmath11 increases .",
    "it could happen sooner in the strange sector , where the strange quark may play a special role .",
    "alternatively , the method will allow a determination of the cross section of hyperons ( @xmath23 ,  ) or vector mesons ( @xmath24 , j/@xmath25 ,  ) scattering with nucleons , or the interactions between other unstable hadrons .",
    "more generally it offers us a way to access the mechanisms of the formation of hadrons in cold nuclear matter .",
    "i have already presented these conjectures in several conference talks  @xcite and prospect reports . in the mean time",
    "the clas collaboration at jlab has completed , with an unprecedented statistics , a study  @xcite of the interactions of a real photon beam ( maximum energy 3.7 gev ) on a deuterium target : it provides us with a unique testing ground of these ideas and the method .",
    "this article is not one more attempt to predict the size of the signal of color transparency : too many parameters are unknown and although we already know what are the qualitative expectations , only experiments will allow us to quantify the effect .",
    "this article is rather an attempt to provide a comprehensive recollection and update of the various matrix elements in the meson production sectors and to provide a base line calculation in a dedicated kinematical range , already accessible at jlab at 6 gev and its further upgrade to 12 gev , from which any deviation will be meaningful .",

    "the model is a straightforward update of the diagrammatic approach  @xcite which has been successful in the analysis of meson production reactions at lower energies ( let s say in the resonance region ) .",
