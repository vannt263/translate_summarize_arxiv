    "the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) is an important test for galaxy formation models .",
    "experimentally our knowledge of the sfh comes from @xcite up to @xmath5 and from observations of color - selected lyman break galaxies @xcite , ly@xmath6 emitters @xcite , uv+ir measurements @xcite , and grb observations @xcite at higher @xmath4 ( hereafter , these will be refereed to as h2006 , m2007 , b2008 , o2008 , r2008 , c2007 , y2008 and w2009 , respectively ) .",
    "however , direct high-@xmath4 measurements constitute an extreme challenge even for the most powerful telescopes and remain sparse .    due to their high luminosity grbs",
    "can be used as sfh probes into the very distant universe @xcite , potentially to higher redshifts than allowed by galaxies alone .",
    "for example , grb 090429b at @xmath7 @xcite is the current record - holder object , followed by a @xmath8 galaxy @xcite and grb 090423 , at @xmath9 @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the redshift distribution of grbs can give us important clues on the early stages of cosmic history .",
    "in practice , the connection between grbs and the underlying host galaxy star formation mode is far from trivial ( see e.g. @xcite ) , thus making the probe value subject to uncertainties .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show how _ principal component analysis _",
    "( pca ) can be used to map the grb redshift distribution onto the cosmic sfh in a model - independent way .",
    "pca has already been applied to other astrophysical and cosmological contexts @xcite , and recognized as a useful tool to reconstruct parameters without the introduction of _ ad hoc _ parameterizationscdm model with wmap7 best fit parameters @xcite , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 km s@xmath2 mpc @xmath2 . ] .",
    "we assume that the formation rate of long grbs ( duration longer than 2 sec ) follows closely the sfh ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the comoving rate of observable grbs , @xmath12 is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the field of view of the experiment , @xmath15 is the grb formation efficiency , @xmath16 is the beaming factor of the burst , @xmath17 is the fraction of grbs with measured redshift and @xmath18 is the luminosity threshold of a given experiment . in the following we discuss in detail each of the terms in eq .",

    "we define telescope - related quantities in eq .",
    "( [ psigrb ] ) after _ swift _ specs , i.e. @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 .. ] the overall grb rate depends on @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the opening angle of the jet . according to @xcite the average value of @xmath23 . using a radio transients survey , @xcite placed the upper limit @xmath24 .",
    "we set @xmath25 as a fiducial value .    the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath26 , determines the fraction of stars massive enough to leave a black hole remnant .",
    "current theories indicate that the threshold mass to trigger a grb is @xmath27@xcite .",
    "however , only a fraction @xmath28 @xcite of black holes resulting from supernova explosion actually gives rise to a grb ; to be conservative , we considered @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the grb formation efficiency factor per stellar mass is @xmath30 for simplicity , we assume a  standard \" salpeter imf , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 @xcite .    the number of detectable grbs depends on the instrument sensitivity and intrinsic isotropic grb luminosity function . for the latter ,",
    "we adopt a power - law distribution function of @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the luminosity threshold is then @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the luminosity distance and @xmath39 is the bolometric energy flux limit of the instrument . in what follows we set @xmath40 @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ psigrb ] ) we can determine the number of observed grbs with redshift in ( @xmath4 , @xmath41 ) over a time interval , @xmath42 , in the observer rest frame : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the comoving volume element per unit of redshift .",
    "our observable , i.e. the cumulative number @xmath45 of grbs up to redshift @xmath4 , is given by @xmath46 so far we have discussed the physical meaning of all terms in eq .",
    "( [ psigrb ] ) except the sfh .",
    "since our aim is to build a model which is independent from the specific form of @xmath47 , we avoid making hypothesis about this quantity . instead , our intention is to derive @xmath47 by using pca and a ( mock or real ) data set whose data points are @xmath48 pairs .",
    "the main goal of pca is the dimensionality reduction of an initial parameter space through the analysis of its internal correlations .",
    "suppose we have a model composed by @xmath49 parameters .",
    "if two of them are highly correlated , they are actually providing the same information .",
    "this means that it is possible to rewrite the data in a new parameter space consisting of @xmath50 terms , with minimum loss of information ( for a complete review see @xcite ) .",
    "this new set of parameters are recognized as the principal components ( pcs ) , or the eigenvectors of the fisher information matrix , .",

    "we investigate a specific quantity , @xmath58 , which can be written as a function of the parameters @xmath59 . in this context , the likelihood function is given by @xmath60 and the fisher matrix is defined as @xmath61 brackets in eq .",

    "is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the set @xmath62 forms a complete base of uncorrelated vectors .",
    "this allows us to use a subspace of @xmath62 , @xmath66 , to rewrite @xmath58 as a linear combination of all the elements in @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the data is then used to find the values of the linear expansion coefficients , @xmath68 ( for a detailed discussion see i2011 ) .",
    "the question of how many pcs should be used in the final reconstruction , or how to choose the dimensionality of @xmath66 , depends on the particular data set analyzed and our expectation towards them .",
    "to provide an idea of how much of the initial information ( variance ) is included in our plots , we shall order them following their _ cumulative percentage of total variance_. a reconstruction with the first @xmath69 pcs encloses a percentage of this value @xmath70 it is important to emphasize that each added pc brings its associated uncertainty ( @xmath71 ) into the reconstruction .",
    "so , although the best - fitted reconstruction converges to the  real \" function as m increases , the uncertainty associated also raises . as a consequence , the question of how many pcs turns into a matter of what percentage of total variance we are willing to enclose .      to specify our method of sfh reconstruction from grb data ,",

    "first , we need to properly choose our data set .",
    "since only grbs with measured redshifts can be used in our analysis , the question of how the redshift measurements were obtained must be examined carefully .",
    "grbs redshifts are generally obtained from optical afterglow spectra using absorption lines or photometry , or from the spectrum of the host galaxy using emission lines . as pointed by @xcite ,",
    "different methods yield different redshift distributions : a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : swift_hist ] illustrates this point .",
    "most noticeably , the grb redshift distribution determined from their hosts lacks very high-@xmath4 events .",
    "moreover , emission ( and to a lesser extent , absorption ) lines are susceptible to a selection effect known as the  redshift desert \" in the range @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "additional bias sources are preliminary discussed by @xcite . to avoid systematic errors affecting the overall redshift distribution , our data sample",
    "is composed by 120 _ swift _ grbs with redshift determined from absorption lines and photometry ( gray region in fig .",
    "[ fig : swift_hist ] , top panel ) .",
    "the next step is to choose the appropriate redshift bin width . in principle",
    ", the quality of the reconstruction should increase with the number of bins .",
    "however , as grb are discrete events , if we pick a bin width based on the available data ( for example , in such a way that each bin has at least one grb ) , the bins will be too wide ( @xmath116 ) . in this case , the assumption that the sfh is constant inside the bin will not hold , leading to reconstructions with bad resolution . to overcome this limitation we performed a gaussian kernel fit for a kernel @xmath117 , bin width @xmath118 and a total of @xmath119 bins . ] to the data ( black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : swift_hist ] , top panel ) .",
    "now we have a continuous probability distribution function ( pdf ) for @xmath120 , which follows the real data distribution and allows us to set the bin width as small as required .",
    "we kept @xmath94 and use the pdf to calculate the cumulative number of observed grbs in each bin .",

    "the procedure was successfully validated using synthetic data and next applied to actual _ swift _ data ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    it is important to highlight that the approach is completely independent of the initial choice of the theoretical model parameter vector , @xmath57 .",
    "this has the obvious advantage of avoiding any a priori hypothesis on the sfh , @xmath123 .",
    "however , the degeneracy between @xmath123 and any other factor we are failing to take into account can not be removed , i.e. the reconstructed sfh contains also the behavior of all the agents influencing the determination of @xmath45 and not included in the model .",
    "for example , @xcite have argued that grb progenitors will have a low metallicity .",
    "such an effect would be a consequence of the mass and angular momentum loss caused by winds in high - metallicity stars .",
    "this would prevent such stars of becoming grbs and consequently , change their expected redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "we implicitly considered that this and other such effects will span within the error bars in our analysis .    in spite of the remaining uncertainties , which are probably less severe than those affecting other methods aimed at recovering the high-@xmath4 tail of the sfh",
    ", there are robust indications that we can gather from the analysis of our results .",
    "the first is that the combination of grb data and pca suggest that the level of star formation activity at @xmath124 could have been already as high as the present - day one ( @xmath1 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is a factor 3 - 5 times higher than deduced from high-@xmath4 galaxy searches through drop - out techniques , similarly to the trend found by @xcite .",
    "if true , this might alleviate the long - standing problem of a photon - starving reionization ; it might also indicate that galaxies accounting for most of the star formation activity at high redshift go undetected by even the most deep searches .",
    "finally it is worth noticing that a sustained high-@xmath4 star formation activity is consistent with predictions of reionization models that simultaneously match a number of observable experimental constraints as the gunn - peterson effect , thomson free - electron optical depth , lyman limit systems statistics etc .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "given the expected large growth of grb detections from the next generation of instruments , the method proposed here promises to become one of the most suitable and reliable tools to constrain the star formation activity in the young universe .",
