    "similar in - plane anisotropic magnetic correlations were also observed in the iron - based superconductors @xcite that are highly frustrated , too , where its microscopic origin , from the ellipticity of the electron pockets or the competing exchange interactions associated with the local - moment magnetism , is still being strongly argued @xcite .",

    "this indicates that the afm ordering observed in srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 is indeed of long range in character in comparison with the reported extremely - broad magnetic diffuse scattering which was attributed to the presence of short - ranged magnetic ordering in polycrystalline sr@xmath59o@xmath2 ( _ re _ = ho , er , dy ) samples in the study of reference @xcite . with the same method utilized in the analysis of the data as shown in * figure  [ fig6]a * , we also analyze the npd peak of the nuclear bragg ( 2 , 0 , 0 ) reflection as shown in * figure  [ fig6]b * and extract that @xmath60  .",
    "this indicates that @xmath61 = 66(3)% basically in accord with the compatibility between ordered magnetic and nuclear crystalline domains extracted with our single - crystal neutron - scattering data .",
    "since our npd data were collected from a pulverized srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal , that @xmath62 is @xmath3 2.5 times larger than @xmath63 may indicate that there have strong magnetic and crystalline domain effects in single - crystal srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 , or a large part of spins are blocked probably due to a pining effect by strains accumulated during single crystal growth . in any case , this difference between single - crystalline and polycrystalline samples in turn supports the fact that there is a strong magnetic frustration in single - crystal srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "further studies with high pressures would be of great interest .    in most cases ,",
    "the strength of the indirect magnetic interactions such as conventional double- or super - exchange @xcite can be influenced more or less by the value of the revelent bond angle @xcite , e.g. the @xmath43tb - o - tb bond angles in srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 as listed in * table 1 * ( see also * figure  [ fig7 ] * ) .",
    "however , the respective values of @xmath43tb - o - tb display no appreciable difference within accuracy between 0.5 and 10 k ( * table 1 * ) , below and above the @xmath64 , respectively , which may indicate an invalidity of the two conventional magnetic coupling mechanisms ( double- or super - exchange ) in srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the study of srtm@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and in excellent agreement with our transport study , where any attempts to measure possible resistivity in srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 from 2 to 300 k were fruitless .",
    "we estimate that the resistance of the single crystal measured is beyond at least 10@xmath65 ohm .",
    "we thus conclude that srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 is a robust insulator , and the electrons responsible for the incommensurable antiferromagnetism are mainly from the localized 4@xmath66 shell of the ionic tb@xmath54 ions . in this localized picture , the interionic exchange interactions dominate for the formation of the magnetic structure @xcite .",

    "by contrast , the interaction between the nn tb2 ions is blocked unexpectedly ( * figure  [ fig3]b * ) .",
    "there is no appreciable difference in the nn tb - tb bond length , i.e. , the _ c _ lattice constant , between 0.5 and 10 k ( * table 1 * ) , which probably rules out the potential direct exchange interaction consistent with the fact that unpaired 4__f _ _ electrons are deeply embedded under the @xmath67 shells and also indicates that the prevalent dipole - dipole interaction is subjected to some condition , i.e. , the octahedral distortion as discussed below , in agreement with the study of srtm@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as a non - kramers ion , tb@xmath54 ( @xmath68 ) in principle keeps the time reversal symmetry and does nt show any energy degeneracy in the presence of the purely - localized electric field .",
    "however , we refine two kinds of octahedra as shown in * figure  [ fig7 ] * : tb1o@xmath34 and tb2o@xmath34 , corresponding to the partially - ordered and totally - frozen tb1 and tb2 ions , respectively",
    ". the average octahedral distortion @xcite can be quantitatively measured by the parameter @xmath46 defined as : @xmath69}}^2 $ ] , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the six tb - o bond lengths along the six crossed directions ( * figure  [ fig7 ] * ) and the mean tb - o bond length ( * table 1 * ) , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath46 values of the tb1 and tb2 ions are in the same magnitudes as those of the mn@xmath54 kramers and mn@xmath72 non - kramers ions , respectively , in the jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted regime of single - crystal la@xmath73sr@xmath74mno@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this sharp contrast implies that the tb1 ions are strongly distorted , while the tb2 ions behave normally within the non - kramers scheme .",
    "therefore , the @xmath46 magnitude that reflects the ion local symmetry and thus the strength of the surrounding cef directly determines the existence of the magnetic ordering , which is supported by the observation that below @xmath75 the respective @xmath46 values of the tb1 and tb2 ions change oppositely with temperature ( * figure  [ fig8 ] * ) .",
    "we therefore infer that one possible reason for the formation of the incommensurable magnetic structure is the modulated distribution of the @xmath76 valence electrons which modify the surrounding environment experienced by the localized unpaired 4__f _ _ electrons .",
    "the corresponding modulation of the local symmetry may plausibly be attributed to the spatial zigzag - type tb arrangements along the _ a _ and _ b _ axes in the process of forming the crystallographic domains .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the honeycomb columns run straightly along the _ c _ axis , and there is no spin modulation at all in that direction .",
    "based on the refined tb - o bond lengths , we deduce two distortion modes for the tb1o@xmath34 and tb2o@xmath34 octahedra ( * figure  [ fig7 ] * ) , respectively . the possible product of the tb1",
    "subjected stress - vectors ( small arrows ) should point qualitatively to the direction of the tb1 moment , implying a strong single - ion anisotropy .",
    "this jt - like distortion mode leads to the large @xmath46 value of the tb1 ions , and possibly lifts further the degenerate multiplets .",
    "by contrast , the tb2 ions are subjected to opposing stresses in all the three pair - directions . in this case , the octahedral distortion strongly depends on their competing strengths .",
    "this mode makes the small @xmath46 value of the tb2 ions and their potential total magnetic moments quenched vitally .",
    "the maximum tb1 moment size is mere 1.92(6 ) @xmath33 , 21.3(7)% of the theoretical saturation value ( @xmath77 9 @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is of particular interest to explore the frustrating mechanism .",
    "the virtual non - kramers state of the tb2 site reduces the total moment size per molar formula by 50% .",
    "the tb1 moment fluctuates like a wave defined as @xmath27 = @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a spin coordinate along the _ a _ axis and @xmath80 is a phase parameter .",
    "the existence of the strong single - ion anisotropy indicates a large cef effect which should be comparable to the energy scale of the magnetic interactions . we have shown the clear evidence for a large magnetic exchange anisotropy ( * figure  [ fig5 ] * ) , which is ascribed to the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction . the nn magnetic arrangement is fm ( * figure  [ fig3]b * ) , implying no possibility for a magnetic frustration .",
    "the nnn magnetic configurations display a dual character , i.e. , fm and afm for the equivalent tb11 and tb12 sites , respectively .",
    "this sharp difference may frustrate the heisenberg - exchange coupled nnn spins .",
    "to summarize , we have synthesized large enough srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals suitable for neutron scattering studies and revealed a modulated spin structure in srtb@xmath1o@xmath2 with the highest afm transition temperature at @xmath81 4.28(2 ) k in the sr@xmath59o@xmath2 family , which provides a technically friendly platform to explore the related magnetic coupling and frustrating mechanisms .",
    "our studies show that the localized tb1 moments lie in the _ bc _ plane with the fm chains along both the _ b _ and _ c _ directions and the afm modulation mainly along the _ a _ axis .",
    "we have found two distinct octahedra for the non - kramers tb@xmath54 ions : tb1o@xmath34 being strongly distorted , corresponding to the partially - ordered moments ; tb2o@xmath34 being frustrated entirely in the non - kramers state .",
    "therefore , the octahedral distortion has a decisive influence on the hund s rule magnetic ground state @xmath82 and the related frustrations .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is crucial in determining the direction of the ordered moments .",
    "the direct nn interaction results in a fm arrangement for the tb1 ions along the _ c _ axis , and the different nnn tb configurations ( fm and afm ) further lift the magnetic frustration .",
