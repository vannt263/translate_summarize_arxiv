    "<S> the non - traditional application of statistical physics to many problems of interdisciplinary nature has been growing steadily in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has been recognized that the study of statistical and complex systems can provide valuable tools and insight into many emerging interdisciplinary fields of science @xcite . in this context , the mathematical modeling of social phenomena allowed to perform quantitative investigations on processes such as self - organization , opinion formation and spreading , cooperation , formation and evolution of social structures , etc ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , a model for social influence proposed by axelrod @xcite , which aims at understanding the formation of cultural domains , has recently received much attention @xcite due to its remarkably rich dynamical behavior .    in axelrod s model , </S>",
    "<S> culture is defined by the set of cultural attributes ( such as language , art , technical standards , and social norms @xcite ) subject to social influence . </S>",
    "<S> the cultural state of an individual is given by their set of specific traits , which are capable of changing due to interactions with their acquaintances . </S>",
    "<S> in the original proposal , the individuals are located at the nodes of a regular lattice , and the interactions are assumed to take place between lattice neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> social influence is defined by a simple local dynamics , which is assumed to satisfy the following two properties : ( a ) social interaction is more likely taking place between individuals that share some or many of their cultural attributes ; ( b ) the result of the interaction is that of increasing the cultural similarity between the individuals involved .    by means of extensive numerical simulations , it was shown that the system undergoes a phase transition separating an ordered ( culturally polarized ) phase from a disordered ( culturally fragmented ) one , which was found to depend on the number of different cultural traits available @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of the model was also studied in different complex network topologies , such as small - world and scale - free networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations considered , however , zero - temperature dynamics that neglected the effect of fluctuations .    following axelrod s original idea of incorporating random perturbations to describe the effect of _ cultural drift _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , noise was later added to the dynamics of the system @xcite . with the inclusion of this new ingredient </S>",
    "<S> , the disordered multicultural configurations were found to be metastable states that could be driven to ordered stable configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of disordered metastable states depends on the competition between the noise rate , @xmath0 , and the characteristic time for the relaxation of perturbations , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for @xmath2 , the perturbations drive the disordered system towards monocultural states , while , for @xmath3 , the noise rates are large enough to hinder the relaxation processes , thus keeping the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath1 scales with the system size , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 , the culturally fragmented states persist in the thermodynamic limit , irrespective of the noise rate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , an extension of the model was proposed , in which the role of _ mass media _ and other mass external agents was introduced by considering external @xcite and autonomous local or global fields @xcite , but neglecting random fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the fields and the individuals was chosen to resemble the coupling between an individual and their neighbors in the original axelrod s model . according to the adopted prescription </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction probability was assumed to be null for individuals that do not share any cultural feature with the external message . in this way , intriguing , counterintuitive results were obtained : the influence of mass media was found to disorder the system , thus driving ordered , culturally polarized states towards disordered , culturally fragmented configurations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to include the effect of cultural drift in an alternative mass media scenario . </S>",
    "<S> although still inspired in the original axelrod s interaction , the mass media coupling proposed here is capable of affecting the cultural traits of any individual in the society , including those who do not share any features with the external message .    for noise rates below a given transition value , which depends on the intensity of the mass media interactions , </S>",
    "<S> only the ordered phase is observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , for higher levels of noise above the transition perturbation rate , both the ordered ( culturally polarized ) phase and the disordered ( culturally fragmented ) phase are found . in the latter case , we obtain an order - disorder phase diagram as a function of the field intensity and the number of traits per cultural attribute . according to this phase diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the role of the external field is that of inducing cultural ordering , a behavior opposite to that reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using a different prescription for the mass media interaction . in order to show the plausibility of the scenario considered here </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the predictions of this model to statistical data measuring the impact of a mass media vasectomy promotion campaign in brazil @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by considering individuals located at the sites of an @xmath6 square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the cultural state of the @xmath7th individual is described by the integer vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of the vector , @xmath10 , defines the number of cultural attributes , while @xmath11 corresponds to the number of different cultural traits per attribute . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the specific traits for each individual are assigned randomly with a uniform distribution . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the mass media cultural message is modeled by a constant integer vector @xmath12 , which can be chosen as @xmath13 without loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the mass media message relative to the local interactions between neighboring individuals is controlled by the parameter @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) is introduced to represent the noise rate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model dynamics is defined by iterating a sequence of rules , as follows : ( 1 ) an individual is selected at random ; ( 2 ) with probability @xmath14 , he / she interacts with the mass media field ; otherwise , he / she interacts with a randomly chosen nearest neighbor ; ( 3 ) with probability @xmath0 , a random single - feature perturbation is performed .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the @xmath7th and @xmath17th individuals is governed by their cultural overlap , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the kronecker delta . with probability @xmath20 , </S>",
    "<S> the result of the interaction is that of increasing their similarity : one chooses at random one of the attributes on which they differ ( i.e. , such that @xmath21 ) and sets them equal by changing the trait of the individual selected in first place . naturally , if @xmath22 , the cultural states of both individuals are already identical , and the interaction leaves them unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the @xmath7th individual and the mass media field is governed by the overlap term @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the precedent case , @xmath24 is the probability that , as a result of the interaction , the individual changes one of the traits that differ from the message by setting it equal to the message s trait . again </S>",
    "<S> , if @xmath25 , the cultural state of the individual is already identical to the mass media message , and the interaction leaves it unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath26 ; thus , the mass media coupling used here is capable of affecting the cultural traits of any individual in the society , including those who do not share any features with the external message . </S>",
    "<S> as commented above , this differs from the mass media interaction proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which was given by @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 4.2truein=3.1truein    as regards the perturbations introduced in step ( 3 ) , a single feature of a single individual is randomly chosen , and , with probability @xmath0 , their corresponding trait is changed to a randomly selected value between 1 and @xmath11 .    in the absence of fluctuations , the system evolves towards absorbing states , i.e. , frozen configurations that are not capable of further changes . for @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> instead , the system evolves continuously , and , after a transient period , it attains a stationary state . in order to characterize the degree of order of these stationary states , we measure the ( statistically - averaged ) size of the largest homogeneous domain , @xmath29 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here correspond to systems of linear size @xmath30 and a fixed number of cultural attributes , @xmath31 , typically averaged over 500 different ( randomly generated ) initial configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> = 4.2truein=3.1truein    figure 1 shows the order parameter , @xmath32 , as a function of the noise rate , @xmath0 , for different values of the mass media intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the number of different cultural traits per attribute is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated , for small noise rates , the perturbations drive the decay of disordered metastable states , and thus the system presents only ordered states with @xmath34 . as the noise rate </S>",
    "<S> is gradually increased , the competition between characteristic times for perturbation and relaxation processes sets on , and , for large enough noise rates , the system becomes completely disordered . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , which was already reported in the absence of mass media interactions @xcite , is here also observed for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> as we consider plots for increasing values of @xmath14 , the transition between ordered and disordered states takes place for increasingly higher levels of noise . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is an indication of the competition between noise rate and external field effects , thus showing that the external field induces order in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the order - disorder phase diagram as a function of the field intensity and the number of traits per cultural attribute , for the noise rate @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition points correspond to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath38 case , noise - driven order - disorder transitions were found to be roughly independent of the number of traits per cultural attribute , as long as @xmath39 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a similar , essentially @xmath40independent behavior for @xmath35 as well . </S>",
    "<S> typical snapshot configurations of both regions are also shown in figure 2 , where the transition from the ( small-@xmath14 ) multicultural regime to the ( large-@xmath14 ) monocultural state is clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> a majority of individuals sharing the same cultural state , identical to the external message , is found within the ordered phase . for smaller noise rates , @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the system is ordered even for @xmath38 , and hence only the monocultural phase is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> = 4.2truein=3.1truein    in order to gain further insight into the interplay and competition between cultural drift and mass media effects , let us now consider the external message being periodically switched on and off . starting with a random disordered configuration and assuming a noise level above the transition value for the @xmath38 case , we observe a periodical behavior : the system becomes ordered within the time window in which the field is applied , while it becomes increasingly disordered when the message is switched off . </S>",
    "<S> a cycle representing this behavior is shown by the solid line in figure 3 , which corresponds to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can compare this behavior to statistical data measuring the impact of a mass media vasectomy promotion campaign in brazil @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> symbols in figure 3 correspond to the number of vasectomies performed monthly in a major clinic in so paulo , spanning a time interval of 2 years . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded region indicates the time window in which the mass media campaign was performed . the promotion campaign consisted of prime - time television and radio spots , the distribution of flyers , an electronic billboard , and public relations activities . in order to allow a comparison to model results , </S>",
    "<S> vasectomy data have been normalized by setting the maximal number of vasectomies measured equal to unity , while the relation between time scales has been chosen conveniently . in the model results , time is measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , where 1 mcs corresponds to @xmath44 iterations of the set of rules ( 1)-(3 ) . for the comparison performed in figure 3 , we assumed that 1 month corresponds to 500 mcs . </S>",
    "<S> although the model parameters and scale units were arbitrarily assigned , it is reassuring to observe that a good agreement between observations and model results can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the steep growth in the number of vasectomies practiced during the promotion campaign , as well as the monotonic decrease afterwards , can be well accounted for by this model .    in order to carry out a straightforward comparison between mass media effects in this model and the measured response within a social group , </S>",
    "<S> several simplifying assumptions were adopted . </S>",
    "<S> as commented above , the model parameters and scale units were conveniently assigned . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , no distinction was attempted between opinions ( as modeled , within axelrod s representation , by sets of cultural attributes in the mathematical form of vectors ) and actual choices ( as measured e.g. by the vasectomy data shown in figure 3 ) . in related contexts , </S>",
    "<S> analogous simplifying assumptions were adopted in the statistical physics modeling of political phenomena ( e.g. the distribution of votes in elections in brazil and india @xcite , italy and germany @xcite , four - party political scenarios @xcite , etc ) , marketing competition between two advertised products @xcite , and applications to finance @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied , in the context of an extension of axelrod s model for social influence , the interplay and competition between cultural drift and mass media effects . </S>",
    "<S> the cultural drift is modeled by random perturbations , while mass media effects are introduced by means of an external field .    </S>",
    "<S> a noise - driven order - disorder transition is found . in the large noise rate regime , both the ordered ( culturally polarized ) phase and the disordered ( culturally fragmented ) phase can be observed , whereas in the small noise rate regime , only the ordered phase is present . in the former case , we have obtained the corresponding order - disorder phase diagram , showing that the external field induces cultural ordering . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is opposite to that reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using a different prescription for the mass media field , which neglected the interaction between the field and individuals that do not share any features with the external message . </S>",
    "<S> the mass media coupling proposed in this work , instead , is capable of affecting the cultural traits of any individual in the society .    in order to show the plausibility of the scenario considered here , we have compared the predictions of this model to statistical data measuring the impact of a mass media vasectomy promotion campaign in brazil . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement between model results and measured data can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the observed behavior is characterized by a steep growth during the promotion campaign , and a monotonic decrease afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus conclude that the extension of axelrod s model proposed here contains the basic ingredients needed to explain the trend of actual observations .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the present findings will contribute to the growing interdisciplinary efforts in the mathematical modeling of social dynamics phenomena , and stimulate further work . </S>"
