    "the time of closing , again determined by a distance criterion between conserved , rigid sections of the enzyme , was recorded .",
    "once the enzyme closed , a reaction time @xmath141 was drawn from a poisson distribution ( here taken to have a mean reaction time of @xmath142 time units ) , which defines the rate at which an unbinding potential was activated by the control parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the probability densities for the time of substrate binding , the closing time of the enzyme after binding , and the overall cycle time are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullhydrodensity ] . the analytical fit to the densities with bootstrap estimates for uncertainties were computed from the raw data using the procedure described in ref .",
    "[ ] .    , @xmath135 , @xmath94 , with a solvent - bead interaction @xmath108 cell lengths , corresponding to @xmath143 . ]    a prominent feature in the probability density of binding times is the long algebraic tail , which is a signature of the substrate initially moving away from the enzyme but eventually diffusing into the active site .",
    "the form of the tail in this density is consistent with the asymptotic long time behavior for a particle diffusing into an absorbing region in three dimensions .",
    "note that the probability density for the overall cycle time can be decomposed into a convolution of the density for binding , closing and diffusion away from the binding site after the reaction is complete . since diffusive motion leads to densities with heavy tails ,",
    "the overall cycle time density is broad , which is characteristic of algebraic tails .",
    "another important qualitative feature of the solvent - enzyme model is the variable degree of solvation of the bpg substrate during the binding process . when the distance @xmath108 characterizing the solvent - bead repulsion is large enough , the solvent is unable to penetrate the volume occupied by the enzyme .",
    "the bpg substrate binds to a region inside the enzyme that is exposed when the enzyme is in an open conformation . upon binding , the enzyme closes via a hinge - like mechanism and brings the adp - bpg substrates near one another enabling the transfer of the phosphoryl group .",
    "less solvent is able to penetrate into the binding pocket of the bpg substrate in the closed conformation of the enzyme , and hence solvent is expelled from the pocket as bpg binds and the enzyme closes , providing a favorable environment for the catalysis .",
    "@xcite    the expulsion of solvent can be tracked by computing the local solvent density around the bpg substrate as it binds and reacts , as can be seen in fig .",

    "( top ) @xmath108 , ( bottom ) @xmath144 . ]    ) .",
    "( top ) @xmath108 , ( bottom ) @xmath144 . ]",
    "when @xmath108 ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : drying ] ) , the bound substrate typically has @xmath145 fewer solvent particles solvating it , whereas away from the enzyme the average number of solvating fluid particles corresponds to the value of the bulk density ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this difference between bulk and bound solvation levels increases as the repulsion parameter @xmath97 increases ( see bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : drying ] where @xmath144 ) .",
    "there are important differences in the qualitative nature of the dynamics when the repulsion parameter becomes large .",
    "although the exterior of the enzyme experiences a larger overall friction , the dissipating effect of the solvent on the enzyme - substrate interaction is decreased in the pocket of the enzyme where the binding occurs .",
    "the bpg substrate retains a high kinetic energy upon entering the pocket for a longer period of time due to a limitation in the simple model of the binding process in which the substrate effectively interacts with only a few beads of the enzyme . because of the limited coupling of the beads in the active site to other beads in the protein , the excess energy of the substrate is slowly dispersed into internal motions of the protein and solvent . for this reason ,",
    "we focus primarily on a regime in which the solvent rapidly dissipates energy ( @xmath108 ) .     for substrate binding ( top panel ) , enzyme closing ( middle panel ) , and total reaction cycle ( bottom panel ) versus time .",
    "the black curves correspond to results for the interacting solvent model , the red curves correspond to the results for the penetrating solvent model with hydrodynamics and the blue curves are the results for the penetrating solvent model without hydrodynamics . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] the probability densities for the binding time , enzyme closing time and overall cycle time are presented .",
    "looking at the top panel , we see that the probability densities of the binding time for the interacting and penetrating solvent models are comparable once the dynamics has been properly scaled by the mass ratio .",
    "this similarity is not surprising , as the time scale for binding is primarily determined by diffusive motion and is not sensitive to the level of solvation of the substrate by the fluid particles .",
    "however the absence of hydrodynamic flow around the enzyme and substrate has a profound effect on both the form of the probability density , which is significantly broadened , and the mean binding time , which is shifted by a factor of roughly a factor of three .",
    "in addition , the binding probability is significantly reduced from @xmath146 , in the presence of hydrodynamics , to @xmath147 , which can have a significant impact on the density for the overall substrate conversion time when the concentration of substrates is elevated .",
    "note that the probability density of binding times has a strong tail for all models , indicative of the importance of the diffusive dynamics experienced by the substrate .",
    "the time required for the enzyme to close after binding is noticeably different in all three models .",
    "the penetrating solvent model does not account for solvent expulsion as the enzyme closes , and therefore has a higher net friction and longer time scale than is present in the explicit interaction model .",
    "once again , the effect of hydrodynamics is significant , and shortens the time required for the enzyme to close .",
    "the overall cycle time density is a convolution of the binding time and closing time densities , and is therefore different for all three models .",
    "a stochastic procedure can be implemented for the overall enzymatic process using data from the numerical simulations and the computed values of the binding probability starting from a radial distance of @xmath70 .",
    "if the binding is accepted starting from the inner sphere with probability @xmath148 , which for the explicit solvent model is approximately @xmath149 , the overall cycle time for the reactive process can be added to the overall time for the process by drawing from the numerically - obtained probability densities and cumulative distributions . to carry out the procedure , the reaction time is drawn by numerically solving the equation @xmath150 for the time @xmath151 using bisection or newton - raphson methods , where @xmath152 is a random variable drawn uniformly from the unit interval . here , @xmath153 is the cumulative distribution for the cycle obtained from the simulation .    to convert the system collision time into physical units , note that the self - diffusion coefficient in system units is @xmath154 @xmath155",
    "equating this with the desired value of the diffusion coefficient in the cytoplasm of roughly @xmath156 , we conclude that @xmath157 seconds . using this scaling , we find that the typical time required for the pgk enzyme to close following binding of both substrates is on the order of @xmath158 to @xmath159 @xmath160 for the solvent models incorporating hydrodynamic flow , which is consistent with experimental  @xcite and simulation  @xcite studies of the enzyme domain motions .",
    "the probability density @xmath161 of substrate conversion times is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : turnover ] .     of the substrate conversion time to products versus time expressed in milliseconds for the explicit solvent model .",
    "the other models yield essentially identical results since the substrate conversion is determined primarily by diffusion when the substrate is at physiological concentrations ]    somewhat surprisingly , no difference in the probability density of substrate conversion time is readily observable at the enzyme concentration studies here even though the binding probability is more than two times larger in the presence of hydrodynamics than in its absence .",
    "this is due to the multiple convolutions of the first passage time densities which have heavy and prominent tails that tend to smooth out observable differences after multiple convolutions .",
    "a stochastic method for computing the probability density of the time required for the enzymatic catalysis of a substrate to product was constructed .",
    "the method consists of combining analytical computations of binding probabilities and first - passage times of a substrate diffusing between two concentric absorbing spheres with explicit simulation of motion of the substrate in the immediate vicinity of the enzyme .",
    "once the explicit simulations have been performed and the data analyzed in terms of binding probabilities and first passage time densities , the method allows the probability density of the time required for the phosphate transfer to be computed at a variety of enzyme concentrations .",
    "the method was illustrated by considering the catalytic transfer of a phosphate group from bpg to a bound adp substrate by the phosphoglycerate kinase enzyme under physiological conditions .",
    "the binding probability and phosphoryl group transfer times for a substrate diffusing in a @xmath162 mm concentration of phosphoglycerate kinase were computed under three different solvent conditions using a network model of the enzymatic system constructed from the morphing analysis of the conformational change between the open and closed conformations@xcite of the enzyme .",
    "the solvent models were chosen to selectively account for various degrees of correlated solvent motion to probe the importance of collective flow effects on the enzyme dynamics .",
    "it was demonstrated that dynamical solvent flow effects assist the binding of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme and facilitate the hinge motion of the enzyme that leads to its closing .",
    "two different models that incorporate hydrodynamic flow effects , one with direct solute - solvent interactions and another penetrating solvent model where solvent particles are treated as point particles in their interactions with the substrate and protein , have similar binding probabilities and cycle time densities .",
    "however , the density profiles of the solvent near the active site as the enzyme closes post - substrate binding differ , since expulsion of the solvent from the binding pocket is not possible for the penetrating - solvent model .",
    "in contrast , a smoluchowski - type model in which all beads feel a friction that is independent of the conformation of the enzyme is characterized by a lower substrate binding probability and a shift in the cycle time density to larger time scales relative to the models incorporating hydrodynamic effects .",
    "the lower substrate binding probability leads to a detectable shift in the maximum appearing in the density of substrate conversion times .",
    "the validity of the stochastic method presented here relies on a number of assumptions that are questionable for the behavior of the enzymatic system in a cellular environment .",
    "it has been assumed that the enzymes are homogeneously distributed with no correlation between their positions in the volume .",
    "it is quite possible that the enzymes are , in fact , locally clustered in the cytoplasm in a way that effectively reduces the distance between them and the substrates thereby enhancing their efficiency .",
    "this is likely to be the case if there is correlation between the spatial location of the phosphoglycerate kinase enzyme and enzymes such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase that act earlier in glycolysis .",
    "in addition , it has been assumed that the dynamics of the substrate in the complex , crowded cytoplasm is diffusive , which may be reasonable on long time scales but less accurate on the time scale of solvent motion .",
    "however , subdiffusive motion of proteins and finite - size probe molecules has been seen in crowded cellular environments .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , assuming substrates do move diffusively in the cytoplasm at long times , the diffusive nature of the substrate dynamics leads to a broad distribution of substrate conversion times that differs substantially for the exponential distribution one might anticipate from mass action kinetics .",
    "it is straightforward , though computationally intensive , to incorporate more detailed models of the enzymatic system to produce quantitatively accurate results .",
    "this is readily accomplished by performing all atom simulations of the system complete with detailed molecular mechanical - based interaction potentials and quantum - mechanical analysis of chemical reaction pathways .",
    "nonetheless , it is likely that the observation that the solvent flow assists the binding and subsequent protein motions will also be observed in more detailed models of the enzymatic system .",
