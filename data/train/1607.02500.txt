    "the standard three - neutrino oscillation framework consists of three mixing angles @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , two mass - squared differences @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath6 .",
    "currently , through a combination of accelerator , reactor , solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , the standard neutrino mixing parameters have been determined to varying degrees of precision .",
    "the leptonic cp phase @xmath6 still remains one of the least known parameters in this scheme .",
    "the possibility of cp violation has not yet been determined with any significant degree of precision",
    ". a value of @xmath6 different from 0 or 180@xmath7 would indicate cp violation in the lepton sector . in the quark sector ,",
    "cp violation has been observed and can be explained by the complex phase in the ckm mixing matrix due to complex yukawa couplings or complex higgs field vacuum expectation values @xcite .",
    "similar origins for the leptonic cp phase have been proposed , but are yet to be experimentally verified .",
    "the possibility of leptonic cp violation is an important issue , since it can provide an explanation for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "also , a knowledge of the cp phase would complete the picture of the pmns @xcite mixing matrix .",
    "there have been several attempts to study cp sensitivity using current and proposed long - baseline experiments - with conventional superbeams @xcite , long - baseline experiments like no@xmath0a @xcite and t2k @xcite , future experiments like dune @xcite , lbno @xcite and t2hk @xcite etc .",

    ".    however , there is an additional complication which may hamper the determination of leptonic cp violation - the possible presence of new physics which can give rise to additional cp phases which mimic the leptonic cp phase and lead to further degeneracies .",
    "recently , this issue has been analyzed in @xcite in the context of a light sterile neutrino in the dune experiment .",
    "non - unitary neutrino mixing can also give an extra cp violating phase which results in this kind of degeneracy .",

    "non - unitarity ( nu ) in the neutrino mixing matrix is one of the possible departures from the standard three - neutrino mixing framework , and can occur due to the induction of neutrino mass through the type - i seesaw mechanism . if the messenger fermions involved are within the reach of the large hadron collider , a rectangular leptonic mixing matrix would be obtained , giving an effectively non - unitary neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",

    "in this section , we study the effect of non - unitarity on the oscillation probability @xmath53 and the cp asymmetry .            in fig .",
    "[ prob ] , the behaviour of the probability is depicted as a function of neutrino energy for the different experiment baselines . it is to be noted that the peak energy of the respective experiments is about 0.6 gev for t2k , about 2 gev for no@xmath0a and about 3 gev for dune . both the neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities are depicted , under the assumption of normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh ) as well as inverted neutrino mass hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "the neutrino parameters are fixed at their respective best - fit values .",
    "the figures are plotted for 2 values of the non - unitary parameters - ( a ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 at their respective lower bounds and @xmath15 at its upper bound ( blue band ) , and ( b ) with all three parameters at intermediate values within their allowed ranges ( cyan band ) .",
    "the cp phase @xmath6 and the non - unitary phase @xmath54 are varied as described below .    in fig .",
    "[ prob ] , the width of a band for a given value of energy indicates the uncertainty in the oscillation probability due to the uncertainty in the parameter being varied . in the blue and cyan band , both @xmath6 and the new phase @xmath54 are varied over their full range , i.e. from @xmath55 $ ] . in the red and the green band , only @xmath6",
    "is varied over its full range @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the green band represents the standard three - flavor ( 3 + 0 ) scenario , where all non - unitary parameters are set to zero , while in the red band the non - unitary parameters are non - zero ( assumed to be at the intermediate values ( b ) ) , but the non - unitary phase @xmath54 is zero .",
    "the following principal features can be observed from this figure :    * the deviation of the red band ( non - zero nu parameters apart from nu phase ) from the green band ( standard 3-flavor case ) is only because of the magnitude of the nu parameters , since the nu phase @xmath56 for the red band .",
    "it can be seen that the red and green bands have a minor difference over the energy range of interest , indicating that just the presence of non - unitarity might affect the determination of @xmath6 .",
    "the red band would be wider if more deviated values of nu parameters are taken .",
    "* the difference between the red and green bands is nearly negligible for the inverted hierarchy case for all three baselines , while a small variation is visible in the normal hierarchy case .",
    "the difference gets accentuated in the energy range above the energy corresponding to the peak energy for each experiment .",
    "* the blue and cyan bands are much wider compared to the red and green bands , and this indicates the increased uncertainty in the probability when the nu phase @xmath54 is varied . as expected , the blue band is wider than the cyan band because the values of the nu parameters are at their bounds for the blue band and are less deviated from non - unitarity for the cyan band .",
    "the wide bands arising from variation of both @xmath6 and @xmath54 depicts the degeneracy between these two parameters , since for slightly displaced values of energy the same probability measurement may arise from different combinations of the two phases , effectively leading to a mimicking of the standard cp phase by the nu phase .",
    "also , an observation of cp violation may be due to either of the two phases .",
    "* the black line corresponds to the cp invariant case in the 3 + 0 scenario ( @xmath57 ) while the yellow line is its counterpart in the new physics scenario ( both @xmath58 ) .",
    "the nu parameters are kept at their central values for the latter case .",
    "it is observed that for t2k , both the plots are well separated while for no@xmath0a and dune , the separation is distinct near the peak energy .",
    "this indicates that cp invariance in the @xmath16 channel may be misinterpreted as cp violation in the three family scenario at these experiments .",
    "further information may be derived from the cp ( neutrino - antineutrino ) asymmetry , which is defined as follows - @xmath59    the cp asymmetry is a measure of cp violation , since it quantifies the change in the oscillation probability when the cp phase changes sign . in a cp",
    "conserving situation , @xmath60 would be zero .",
    "the greater is the deviation of this factor from zero , the greater is the projected cp violation for that combination of parameters , baseline and energy .",
    "also , the cp asymmetry takes into account the behaviour of the neutrino as well as antineutrino probabilities , and it has been noted that the combination of these two probabilities leads to special features which are not present in the neutrino or antineutrino probability alone @xcite .            in fig .",
    "[ asym ] , the cp asymmetry is plotted as a function of neutrino energy for the three experiment baselines under consideration , for neutrinos and antineutrinos and for both normal and inverted mass hierarchy . as in fig .",
    "[ prob ] , the standard neutrino parameters are fixed at their best - fit values , and two sets of non - unitary parameters are chosen - putting the @xmath61 parameters at their bounds ( blue band ) and at intermediate values ( cyan band ) . in the blue and cyan bands , @xmath6 as well as the nu phase @xmath54",
    "are varied over the full range [ @xmath62 .",
    "for the red band , @xmath6 is varied over the full range and nu parameters are at intermediate values but @xmath54 is set to zero .",
    "the region between the two green lines indicates the range of cp asymmetry for the 3-flavor scenario ( all nu parameters zero ) .",
    "the following prominent features may be noted from fig .",
    "[ asym ] :    * for the nh case , the region between the green lines ( standard 3-flavor cp asymmetry ) decreases gradually with increasing energy , while the width of the red band ( cp asymmetry with non - zero nu parameters but @xmath56 ) increases with increasing energy .",
    "this means that at higher energies , the nu parameters , even without the nu phase , add to the uncertainty in the cp asymmetry .",
    "this behaviour is observed for all three baselines .",
    "* at energy values of about 0.6 gev for t2k , 1.6 gev for no@xmath0a and 2.6 gev for dune , all 4 bands ( red , green , blue and cyan ) are seen to converge and become of the same width .",
    "this indicates that at such values of energy , the effect of nu parameters on the cp asymmetry is minimal and the variation due to nu parameters and @xmath54 coincides with the asymmetry range due to @xmath6 in the 3-flavour case . in @xcite",
    ", it was observed that a combination of neutrino and antineutrino channels helps to resolve the degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath54 for l / e @xmath63 500 km / gev , since some of the cp - dependent terms in the analytic probability expression cancel for this magnitude of l / e .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above energy values correspond to roughly l / e @xmath64 500 km / gev for the respective baselines .",
    "hence this behaviour of the cp asymmetry reflects the cancellation of the @xmath6-nu phase degeneracy in the cp asymmetry for these energies and baselines .",
    "also , for the nh case , these energies act as a threshold after which the widths of the red band and the region between the green lines get reversed , with the red band becoming wider at higher energies .",
    "* in all cases , the blue and cyan bands are narrowest at the energy values described above , and become wider as the energy is increased or decreased . the blue band is wider than the cyan band because the nu parameter values are at their bounds for the blue band and less deviated for the cyan band .",
    "the difference in width between the red and cyan bands is due to the nu phase @xmath54 , whose variation leads to a further uncertainty in the asymmetry .",
    "* in the ih case , an interesting behaviour is observed . the red band , unlike for the nh case , becomes narrower with increasing energy at a faster rate than the region between the green lines ( 3-flavor asymmetry ) , and converges almost to zero at about 1 gev for t2k , 2.7 gev for no@xmath0a and 4.5 gev for dune .",
    "these energy values are somewhat removed from the peak energies of the respective experiments , and hence the behaviour in these regions may not have a major contribution to the cp violation sensitivities of the experiments . however , at the level of the oscillation probability this phenomenon is noteworthy , since it seems to indicate that the presence of non - unitarity leads to a nullification of the cp - violating behaviour of @xmath6 for these specific energy and baseline combinations . in other words , the nu parameters , when @xmath65 , interact with the standard cp phase in a specific manner to cancel the effect of its variation on the cp asymmetry .",
    "the blue and cyan bands demonstrate their regular behaviour ( increasing with energy ) even at these energy values , which means that when @xmath54 is varied the above effect no longer remains and the nu phase restores the uncertainty in the cp asymmetry which got removed due to the nu parameters .",
    "this behaviour is not easy to explain on the basis of the analytic probability expression , and we leave it for now as an intriguing observation which bears further study .    in the next section",
    "we will analyze how these aspects of the oscillation probability behaviour with and without non - unitarity is reflected in the event rates and cp violation sensitivities of the given experiments .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed the effect of non - unitarity in cp violation measurements on the oscillation probability and the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry . in this section",
    "we present a realistic analysis of the problem on the basis of event rate calculations . here",
    "we have simulated all the three experiments separately using the details given in table i and table ii .",
    "we plot the binned events as a function of reconstructed energy .",
    "the green band is the standard 3 + 0 band which arises due to the variation of @xmath6 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "the blue and the cyan bands arise due to the effect of non - unitarity , when we vary both @xmath6 and the new phase @xmath54 in the range @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the red band is a subset of the cyan band obtained by putting @xmath56 .",
    "the behaviour of the events for all the experiments is consistent with the probability behaviour .",
    "we can draw the following conclusions from the event plots :    * for any set of values of the nu parameters , the 3 + 0 band is always bounded by the bands with unitarity violation , and hence in the overlapping region i.e. in the green region , it is not possible to ascertain whether the events are due to variations of nu parameters or of @xmath6 in the 3 + 0 scenario . *",
    "the degeneracy still persists even when the nu phase is 0 i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "not only the new phase @xmath54 , but all the three other nu parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , also play a role in maintaining the ambiguity .",
    "the more we deviate from unitarity , the more is the width of the red band , indicating substantial degeneracy . * the behaviour of the event plots in terms of the band placements is similar for the different experiments , for both the hierarchies and both in neutrino and antineutrino mode . *",
    "the behaviour of the event plots for the cp invariant case , i.e. @xmath57 ( black ) and @xmath58 ( yellow ) , is consistent with the corresponding probability plots .",
    "it is observed that both the lines lie within the green band for all the three experiments and hence cp invariance may be confused with cp violation in the case of three family neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus in the presence of non - unitarity , the measurement of @xmath6 and hence of cp violation gets affected . in the succeeding section , we will perform a @xmath52 analysis to discuss the effects of this ambiguity in detail in the light of the different experiments and their combination .",
    "we define the @xmath52 ( statistical ) for cp violation sensitivity as follows : @xmath68 ^ 2}{n^{i , j}_{true}}\\ ] ] , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the event rates that correspond to data and fit in the @xmath71 bin .",
    "@xmath72 is for neutrinos and @xmath73 for anti - neutrinos .",
    "the number of bins are different for each experiment i.e. for dune there are 39 bins each of width 250 mev in the energy range 0.5 to 10 gev , for no@xmath0a there are 28 bins of width 125 mev in the energy range 0.5 to 4 gev and for t2k , we have 20 bins of width 40 mev in the range 0.4 to 1.2 gev .    in this work",
    "our main focus is to point out the effect of the new phase on cp violation measurements at dune , no@xmath0a and t2k , and hence to study the cp violation sensitivity as well as cp discovery potential of these experiments in the presence of this new phase .",
    "the capability of an experiment to differentiate between cp conserving and cp violating values of @xmath6 is a measure of its cp sensitivity .",
    "so in the standard three family case ( si ) , @xmath70 is only dependent on @xmath6 as we have not marginalised over any other three flavor oscillation parameters throughout this work ( assuming them to be known precisely ) .",
    "hence , while calculating the cp sensitivity we fix @xmath6 at 0 and @xmath67 in the ` fit ' and vary over the whole range of @xmath6 from -@xmath67 to @xmath67 in ` data ' assuming normal hierarchy as the true hierarchy .",
    "when unitarity is violated , we have an additional phase and three new additional parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "hence in the ` fit ' , we take all possible combinations of 0 and @xmath67 ( 4 combinations ) for both @xmath6 and the new phase @xmath54 and vary @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in their allowed range .",
    "we then calculate the minimised @xmath52 i.e @xmath74 as a function of the true parameters and choose the minimum and maximum of @xmath74 for a given true value of @xmath6 .",
    "we have also marginalised over the systematic uncertainties for each experiment as given in table i.    to analyze the effect of the non - unitarity phase on the measurement of cp violation sensitivity , we have also calculated the standard cp violation sensitivity marginalising over the whole range of @xmath54 in the ` fit ' along with all the nu parameters .      while studying the cp violation sensitivity , it is important to note that the @xmath16 oscillation probability is principally associated with cp violation since it is a function of the cp odd term @xmath75 .",
    "but due to the presence of the cp even term @xmath76 , @xmath77 can contribute slightly to cp sensitivity through statistics . as we are studying the potential of each experiment to determine cp violation sensitivity , we have considered both appearance and disappearance channels in the simulation . in this section ,",
    "we discuss two scenarios related to cp violation measurements .    1 .",
    "cp violation irrespective of the source i.e. originating either from the standard dirac @xmath6 phase or from the non - unitary phase @xmath54 .",
    "2 .   standard cp violation due to the standard dirac @xmath6 phase only , in the presence of non - unitarity .    to analyze case ( 1 ) ,",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , we consider four possible combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath54 in ` fit ' , each of which can be either 0 or @xmath67 .        in fig .",
    "[ cp1 ] we show the cp violation sensitivity of the three superbeam experiments dune , no@xmath0a and t2k individually . for comparison",
    ", we have also included their 3 + 0 cp violation results .",
    "it is observed for all the three experiments that in the presence of non - unitarity , the ability to measure the cp violation sensitivity changes drastically .",
    "we have assumed the central values of the allowed range of the non - unitarity parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the true values and for this particular choice of ` data ' , cp violation sensitivity crosses to both sides of the 3 + 0 plot .",
    "this behavior can be explained on the basis of two effects :    * effect of large parameter space * effect of deviation from unitarity    in the 3 + 0 case , we have only one @xmath6 phase and hence to study cp violation sensitivity we contrast any true @xmath6 with cp conserving phases 0 and @xmath67 in ` fit ' .",
    "but in the presence of non - unitarity , we have a total of 4 new parameters and hence 5 parameters to be marginalised in the ` fit ' i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath6 and @xmath54 .",
    "so marginalising over a large parameter space reduces the @xmath74 value .",
    "but at the same time , as we deviate from unitarity ( i.e. @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , the band corresponding to @xmath74 starts to broaden .",
    "specifically , with an increase in @xmath15 , the variation in the true values of @xmath54 also increases .",
    "the band width increases as the deviation increases and it spreads on both sides of the 3 + 0 curve . in the case",
    "depicted , the second effect is dominating over the first and hence the sensitivity to cp violation is higher than that of 3 + 0 for some combinations of @xmath81 . as a result , even at the cp conserving phases 0 and @xmath82",
    ", there is some cp violation sensitivity .",
    "this arises from the fact that the true value of @xmath54 is not necessarily cp conserving at these points . in dune",
    ", it is almost a @xmath83 effect .",
    "all the three experiments show a uniform response .",

    "[ cpdis2 ] shows the @xmath6 cpv discovery potential of these experiments with non - unitarity , where the cp violation originates from @xmath6 only . as observed in the first two panels , the @xmath6 discovery potential of t2k and no@xmath0a is low in the presence of non - unitarity and only a @xmath87 discovery",
    "is possible . in dune and in the combined case ,",
    "the discovery potential from @xmath6 only is greater than for t2k and no@xmath0a but less than the case of discovery from any source of cp violation .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted to analyze the sensitivity to cp violation of the long - baseline experiments no@xmath0a , t2k and dune in the presence of non - unitarity .",
    "specifically , the effect of the extra non - unitary phase @xmath54 is studied , which gives a degeneracy with the standard cp phase @xmath6 and hence leads to a loss of cp violation sensitivity .",
    "below we summarize the salient conclusions of this work :    * at the level of the oscillation probability @xmath53 , there is a greater variation in the probability with @xmath6 for a given energy when the non - unitary parameters are included . if the nu phase @xmath54 is zero , the other nu parameters have only a minor effect on the probability",
    ". the effect increases with increasing energy .",
    "the uncertainty in the probability is more when a full variation in the nu phase is included , indicating a degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath54 depicts the degeneracy between these two parameters , since for slightly separated values of energy the same probability measurement may arise from different combinations of the two phases , effectively leading to a mimicking of the standard cp phase by the nu phase .",
    "also , an observation of cp violation may be due to either of the two phases . *",
    "the cp asymmetry provides further insight into the dependence of the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities on @xmath6 and the nu parameters .",
    "it is observed that for the nh case , the standard 3-flavor cp asymmetry decreases with increasing energy , while the cp asymmetry with non - zero nu parameters but @xmath56 increases with increasing energy , indicating that at higher energies , the nu parameters , even without the nu phase , add to the uncertainty in the cp asymmetry . at energy values of about 0.6 gev for t2k , 1.6 gev for no@xmath0a and 2.6 gev for dune ,",
    "the effect of nu parameters on the cp asymmetry is minimal and the variation due to nu parameters and @xmath54 coincides with the asymmetry range due to @xmath6 in the 3-flavour case .",
    "these values correspond to l / e @xmath63 500 km / gev for each experiment , which was deduced in @xcite to be a magic value of l / e at which combining the neutrino and antineutrino channels resolve the degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath54 . in the ih case",
    ", the presence of non - unitarity seems to nullify the cp - violating behaviour of @xmath6 at about 1 gev for t2k , 2.7 gev for no@xmath0a and 4.5 gev for dune , indicating that the nu parameters , when @xmath65 , interact with the standard cp phase to cancel the effect of its variation on the cp asymmetry .",
    "when @xmath54 is varied this nullifying effect no longer remains .",
    "we leave this result for the ih case as an observation which bears further study . *",
    "the event rates of the experiments no@xmath0a , dune and t2k reflect the behaviour of the oscillation probability when plotted as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy .",
    "the degeneracy between the standard cp phase and the nu parameters , particularly @xmath54 , shows up in the overlapping between the standard event rates and the projected event rates when non - unitarity is included .",
    "* at the level of probabilities as well as event rates , the plots corresponding to @xmath91 without nu and @xmath92 with nu show a separation between these lines , indicating that cp invariance in the @xmath16 channel may be misinterpreted as cp violation in the three family scenario in all three experiments .",
    "* a @xmath52 analysis of the cp violation sensitivity with and without non - unitarity is done in 2 parts - cp violation irrespective of the source i.e. originating either from the standard dirac @xmath6 phase or from the non - unitary phase @xmath54 , and cp violation due to the standard dirac @xmath6 phase only in the presence of non - unitarity . in the first case , it is found that for all three experiments , non - unitarity strongly affects the ability to measure the cp violation sensitivity , which varies on both sides of the standard 3 + 0 case .",
    "this is due to the interplay of the two competing effects of large parameter space and deviation from unitarity.with non - unitarity , there are 4 new parameters to be marginalised in the ` fit ' , and the large parameter space reduces the marginalized sensitivity .",
    "conversely , deviating from unitarity broadens the band width of sensitivity values , spreading on both sides of the 3 + 0 case . combining the three experiments enhances the sensitivity , but the degeneracy described above is still present .",
    "if we analyze the degeneracy from the perspective of the second case i.e. cp violation due to @xmath6 only , we find that the cp violation sensitivity decreases with non - unitarity but there is a separation between the sensitivity for the 3 + 0 case and the sensitivity with non - unitarity over most of the true values of @xmath6 .",
    "combining all the three experiments enhances the sensitivity but it is still less than the 3 + 0 combined sensitivity . due to the effect of large parameter space , the cp violation sensitivity decreases uniformly compared to the 3 + 0 curve .",
    "* cp violation discovery in the presence of non - unitarity , considering cp violation from any source , is seen to be achievable at above 1@xmath93 for most values of true @xmath6 and @xmath54 and at above 2@xmath93 over a significant range , for t2k and no@xmath0a .",
    "the cp violation discovery reach of dune is above @xmath83 over most of the range and above 3@xmath93 over about 50@xmath90 of the range of true @xmath6 .",
    "combining all the experiments improves the cp violation discovery potential slightly as compared to dune .",
    "if we consider cp violation due to @xmath6 only , the cp violation discovery potential is reduced for all the experiments as well as their combination .    in conclusion",
    ", this work shows that it is worthwhile to attempt cp violation sensitivity measurements at long - baseline experiments like t2k , no@xmath0a , dune and their combinations .",
    "the effect of possible degeneracies of the standard cp phase with the non unitary phase and other non unitary parameters is analyzed in detail .",
    "further study may be required to understand and resolve these ambiguities at other energies and baselines .",
