    "understanding the internal structure of scalar mesons is of prime interest in hadron physics for several decades .",
    "it plays a crucial role to understand the chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms of the qcd and the confinement of hadrons . in spite of the striking success of qcd theory for strong interaction",
    "the underlying structure of the light scalar mesons is still under controversy  @xcite .",
    "the classification of scalar mesons suffers from large hadronic uncertainties arising from the fact that scalar mesons share the same spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath12 with the qcd vacuum .",
    "for instance irrespective of the dispute on the existence of @xmath4 and @xmath13 mesons , scalar mesons have been identified as ordinary @xmath5 states , four - quark states or meson - meson bound states or even those supplemented with a scalar glueball . in reality , the nonperturbative qcd fluctuations induce the mixing between different content , which will add further complexities .    at present , there are already many experimental studies on the production of scalar mesons in nonleptonic @xmath14 decays . for instance branching ratios ( brs ) of @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the order of @xmath17 and @xmath9 , respectively  @xcite . on",
    "the theoretical side nonleptonic @xmath14 decays receive large hadronic uncertainties , which can hinder us from getting a clear view of the internal structures of scalar mesons . on the contrary semileptonic @xmath18 decays only contain one scalar meson in the final state , which can be better candidates to probe different structure scenarios of scalar mesons .    in this work , we propose a model - independent way to distinguish two different descriptions for scalar mesons , i.e. the two - quark and the four - quark scenarios , through the semileptonic @xmath19 and/or @xmath0 decays , where @xmath20 denotes a scalar meson among @xmath21 and @xmath4 . in the following method the flavor su(3 )",
    "symmetry will be used to derive different sum rules for the brs under these two scenarios .",
    "these semileptonic heavy meson decays are clean as they do not receive much pollution from the hadronic interactions like nonleptonic heavy meson decays . in @xmath22",
    "decays , the lepton pair can also be replaced by a charmonium state since they own the same properties in the flavor su(3 ) space .",
    "for instance , the mode @xmath23 is probably much easier for the experiments to observe .",
    "the layout of this work is given as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scenarios ] , we will briefly discuss different descriptions for scalar mesons .",
    "the su(3 ) relations for the productions rates and the symmetry breaking effects are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : su(3 ) ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : su(3)-breaking ] , respectively .",
    "the last section contains a couple of remarks and our conclusion .",
    "a number of scalar mesons have been experimentally discovered in different processes , however in contrast to the pseudoscalar and vecor mesons the identification of scalar mesons is more difficult because of their large decay widths causing a strong overlap between different resonances and background . in particular , in recent years there has been controversies about the existence of the two light and very broad states : @xmath13 ( also refereed as @xmath24 ) meson in the @xmath25 mev region ; @xmath4 ( also denoted as @xmath26 ) meson in the region of @xmath27 mev .",
    "the @xmath4 meson , having the same quantum number with the qcd vacuum , might play a significant role in the chiral symmetry breaking and the mass origin of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this meson might also have some relation with the scalar meson proposed in the linear sigma model at 50 years ago  @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies on the possible scalar resonance structure in different experimental processes .",
    "although the data of the @xmath28 invariant mass spectra in the @xmath29 annihilation do not show a distinct resonance structure below 900 mev  @xcite , the existence of the @xmath4 meson is allowed in many processes for instance the @xmath30 scattering  @xcite , the nonleptonic @xmath31 decay channel  @xcite , and the @xmath32  @xcite and @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this pole is also derived in the analysis based on chiral symmetry and roy equations  @xcite and the analysis using unitarized chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the @xmath34 process and found that the data are consistent with a two - step process of @xmath35 with a subsequent final state interaction @xmath36 .",
    "this conclusion prevents us from learning anything new from the coupling of @xmath4 with @xmath37 .",
    "this situation is also similar for the @xmath13 meson .",
    "for example , the data from the bes - ii implies a @xmath24-like structure in @xmath38 decays into @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "a number of phenomenological analysis find a light and broad state consistent with @xmath13 ( see many references in the review  @xcite in the pdg  @xcite ) but this pole is absent in some other work  @xcite .",
    "the inconsistence between different analysis implies the complexities in the nature of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 resonances .",
    "assuming the existence of the @xmath13 and @xmath4 , there are 9 mesons together below or near 1 gev , and in this case it is reasonable to assume the nonet for scalar mesons below or near 1gev consisting of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the @xmath5 picture ,",
    "scalar mesons are viewed as p - wave states  @xcite , whose flavor wave functions are given by @xmath42 in this picture , @xmath3 is mainly made up of @xmath43 , which is supported by the large production rates in @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the experimental data also indicates the nonstrange component of @xmath3 : the br of @xmath46 is comparable with that of @xmath47 . to accommodate with the experimental data ,",
    "@xmath3 is supposed to be the mixture of @xmath48 and @xmath43 as @xmath49 using the brs of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the ratio between the coupling constants of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the br of @xmath54 , the mixing angle @xmath55 is constrained as  @xcite @xmath56 due to the large decay width of @xmath4 meson , the mixing angle is usually identified as an energy dependent variable . in the above determination , the mixing angle has been taken as a constant variable .    from the allowed range of the mixing angle given above",
    ", we can see that @xmath3 is dominated by the @xmath43 component .",
    "the expected dominant decay channel @xmath57 is suppressed by the small phase space .",
    "then @xmath58 decay becomes dominant arising from some nonperturbative interactions such as the rescattering mechanism .",
    "this is supported by the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the classical @xmath5 picture meets with several difficulties .",
    "for example , since @xmath59 quark is expected to be heavier than @xmath60 quark , it is difficult to explain the fact that the strange meson @xmath13 is lighter than the isotriplet mesons @xmath41 , and the isosinglet meson @xmath3 has a degenerate mass with @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , since scalar mesons are identified as the p - wave states in the @xmath5 description , it is difficult to explain why the @xmath13 meson is lighter than its vector partner @xmath61 .    inspired by these difficulties ,",
    "other candidate scenarios are proposed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , scalar mesons are identified as diquark - diquark states . in the su(3 )",
    "flavor space , the two quarks can form two multiplets as @xmath62 while the other two antiquarks reside in @xmath63 or @xmath64 multiplets .",
    "the diquark in a scalar meson is taken to be totally antisymmetric for all quantum numbers , color antitriplet , flavor antitriplet , spin 0 .",
    "the @xmath65 states make a flavor nonet , whose internal structures are given as : @xmath66 taking the mixing into account , the isosinglet mesons are expressed as @xmath67 where the @xmath68 is constrained as  @xcite @xmath69    apart from the @xmath5 and the tetraquark picture ( diquark - diquark ) , there exists another promising candidate interpretation of scalar mesons : they are molecule states . ref .",
    "@xcite found within a potential model that scalar tetraquark systems can only appear in the form of the @xmath70 molecules .",
    "the pair of the isodoublet kaons can form four different states : three mesons as an isovector and one isosinglet meson , which can easily explain the degeneracy of the mass of @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "more importantly the @xmath13 and @xmath4 mesons are irrelevant and thus this scheme is also consistent with the absence of these two resonances as physical states .",
    "the molecule description has also been successfully applied in different processes for instance the effective hamiltonian approach within the molecule picture has been used to compute the @xmath71 and @xmath72 decays  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that our proposed method in the following section is invalid under this interesting picture since the production rates of @xmath4 will be used .    the identification of the scalar mesons below 1 gev as the four - quark states or molecule states can raise the question about the scalar @xmath5 states .",
    "the experimentalists have observed several scalar mesons above 1gev .",
    "the expectation from the naive quark model that @xmath5 scalar mesons @xmath73 are expected to be heavier than the vector @xmath5 partners @xmath74 may also give us a hint that the scalar @xmath5 nonet is made of the several heavier mesons : the isovector and isodoublet mesons @xmath75 , the isosinglet mesons @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 with some ambiguities in the choice of the ninth member since the isosinglet mesons can mix with the scalar gluebll state through the qcd interactions .",
    "nevertheless , since this work mainly concerns the scalar mesons below 1 gev , we will refrain from more discussions of the nature of this heavier @xmath5 nonet .",

    "the left diagram is for two - quark picture , while the right diagram is for the four - quark mesons . ]",
    "although the nature of scalar mesons is very complicated , we will focus on two simple pictures and analyze their productions in the heavy meson decays .",
    "feynman diagrams for @xmath79 decays in two different pictures are given in fig .",
    "[ diagram : feyn ] .",
    "the left panel is for the two - quark scenario , while the right panel is for the four - quark scenario .",
    "if a scalar meson is made of @xmath5 , the light quark is generated from the electroweak vertex and the antiquark @xmath80 serves as a spectator .",
    "thus only the component @xmath81 contributes to semileptonic @xmath14 decays . in the su(3 )",
    "symmetry limit , decay amplitudes of @xmath82 channels under the @xmath83 picture have the following relation @xmath84 where the transition amplitude @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 this leads to a sum rule @xmath87 which is independent of the mixing angles .",
    "one may worry about the accuracy of our above result because of the possible large qcd scattering effect .",
    "however , if we use the hadron picture , we can still get the same result .",
    "the @xmath88 pair produced from the weak interaction in fig.[diagram : feyn](a ) can form isospin 0 and isospin 1 states with the ratio of 1:1 .",
    "the ratio is directly obtained from the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "although the qcd scattering can mix between states , the non - perturbative qcd interactions conserve the isospin .",
    "therefore the sum of production rates of isospin 0 states on the right hand side of eq.([sumrule1 ] ) is always equal to production rates of the isospin 1 states on the left hand side of eq.([sumrule1 ] ) .",
    "the isospin breaking effect in strong interaction is negligible .",
    "if a scalar meson is composed of four quarks , besides the light quark from the electroweak vertex and the spectator , another @xmath89 pair is generated from the qcd vacuum .",
    "this quark pair could be @xmath43 or @xmath90 , where both @xmath91 and @xmath92 contribute .",
    "the decay amplitudes are given as @xmath93 which gives @xmath94.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is meaningful to define the ratio of partial decay widths @xmath95 the ratio is 1 for the two - quark description , while it is 3 for the four - quark description of scalar mesons .",
    "similarly for semileptonic @xmath96 decays , the charm quark in fig.[diagram : feyn ] is replaced by a bottom quark and the @xmath80 quark is replaced by a @xmath97 quark , while leptons are replaced by their charge conjugates .",
    "we have the same sum rules @xmath98    let s now examine whether all these channels are experimentally measurable by estimating the branching ratios for individual channels . if the mixing angle is close to @xmath99 or @xmath100 in the two - quark picture ( in four - quark scenario , the mixing angle is @xmath101 or @xmath102 ) , either @xmath4 or @xmath3 meson has small production rates but the other one should have large production rates . neglecting the highly suppressed channel , the ratio defined in eq.([rule1],[rule2 ] ) can still distinguish the two different scenarios for scalar mesons .",
    "if the mixing angle is not close to the values discussed in the above paragraph , all three @xmath0 channels would have similar brs in magnitude .",
    "the br of the semileptonic @xmath103 decay is measured @xcite as @xmath104 thus as an estimation , generic brs for the cascade @xmath0 decays are expected to have the order @xmath105 while the mixing effects can modify the brs by several times .",
    "for instance if the mixing angles given in eq .  ( [ eq : mixing - angle - qq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing - angle - qqqq ] ) are used , one has the estimates of the brs @xmath106 in two - quark description ; or @xmath107 in the four - quark description , where the mixing angle given in eq .",

    "even we assume the detect efficiency is only @xmath111 , there will be 600 events per running year if the br is used as @xmath112 .",

    "for the three distinct channels , the brs are obtained from eqs .",

    "remember that the above results are obtained in the flavor su(3 ) symmetry limit .",
    "it is also necessary to estimate the symmetry breaking effects since the strange quark is heavier than @xmath140 quark . in the following",
    "we will first analyze the generic size of symmetry breaking effects and then discuss two different cases .",
    "the large su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in @xmath14 meson decays , for example the br of @xmath141 is about three times larger than @xmath142 , may lead to the suspect of the reliability of the sum rules as in eq .",
    "( [ rule2 ] ) .",
    "however the hadronic @xmath143 and @xmath142 decays are different with the decay modes discussed in the this work in several aspects .",
    "the former decays involve two light mesons and the symmetry breaking effects coming from either of them will be constructive   and @xmath144 form factors or decay constants of kaon and pion . in @xmath141 both form factors and decay constants are larger . ] . in",
    "semileptonic @xmath145 decay modes the final state contains only one hadron and the symmetry breaking is naturally smaller .",
    "moreover in hadronic @xmath14 decays , the @xmath146 transitions is induced by the different quark current @xmath147 . on the contrary ,",
    "the transition current at the quark level in this work is @xmath148 , same for channels involving isovector and isosinglet scalar mesons . accordingly",
    "the symmetry breaking effects in semileptonic @xmath123 decays will be smaller than those in hadronic @xmath14 decays .",
    "generically the size of the su(3 ) breaking effect could be roughly estimated by the mass difference between @xmath60 and @xmath59 quarks , whose magnitude is @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the hadronic scale . taking into this generic symmetry breaking effect , the two ratios become @xmath151 in the @xmath5 picture and @xmath152 in the tetraquark picture .",
    "the difference between them could be smaller , but they are still different and our method is still useful .",
    "we also expect smaller su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in @xmath22 meson decays , since the large energy release may weaken the effects from the different masses .",
    "one particular origin is that the isospin singlet scalar mesons have different masses , which can change the phase space in the semileptonic @xmath123 decays .",
    "fortunately , this su(3 ) breaking effect can be well studied , which almost does not depend on the internal structure of scalar mesons or the strong interactions .",
    "the mass of @xmath3 is well measured but the mass of @xmath4 meson has large uncertainties @xmath153 gev .",
    "this big range of masses indeed induces large differences to @xmath14 decays , since the @xmath14 meson mass is only 1.87gev .",
    "the br of the semileptonic decay is affected by a factor of @xmath154 depending on the mass of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "therefore the sum rule in eq.([rule1 ] ) is not good unless the @xmath4 meson mass is well measured .",
    "but in @xmath22 meson decays , the sum rule in eq.([rule2 ] ) will not be affected sizably , since the @xmath4 meson mass is negligible compared with the large @xmath22 meson mass .",
    "numerically , this correction factor in @xmath22 decays is @xmath155 .",
    "this will also affect the extraction of the mixing angle as we have discussed in the previous section .",
    "another su(3 ) breaking effect comes from the decay form factors of various scalar mesons . in the two - quark scenario",
    ", only the @xmath156 component contributes to the transition form factors shown in the left diagram of fig.[diagram : feyn ] .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effect to the form factors is thus negligible . in the four - quark scenario ,",
    "the @xmath157 component in @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonance is different from the internal structure of @xmath158 : @xmath159 . in the right diagram of fig.[diagram : feyn ] , it would be easier to produce the lighter @xmath90 ( or @xmath160 ) quark from the vacuum than the @xmath43 quark .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects may make the form factor of @xmath161 and @xmath162 larger than that of @xmath163 .",
    "it will make the ratio @xmath164 larger than 3 in the four - quark scenario .",
    "thus this su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in the form factors will not spoil our method but instead it will improve its applicability .",
    "in the above two sections , we have discussed the su(3 ) relations for the brs and the symmetry breaking effects in the heavy meson decays .",
    "the individual production rates for @xmath4 and @xmath3 are required in our method .",
    "the effect in the phase space factor caused by the large uncertainties in the mass of the @xmath4 can be directly taken into account .",

    "the background from the @xmath167 can be separated within the partial wave analysis .",
    "another possibility is to use only the @xmath168 mode in the analysis , since @xmath169 can not decay to this final state due to the ",

    ", the simple ratios @xmath170 and @xmath137 will be not useful to constrain the mixing angle . nevertheless , the ratio @xmath164 which needs only the sum of these two states can still provide a method for distinguishing the two descriptions for scalar mesons .",
    "one more ambiguity comes from the mysterious quark content of scalar mesons . in this work ,",
    "we have payed particular attention to the two - quark and tetra - quark picture . as we have mentioned in the introduction section",
    "the physical situation is more subtle , since any meson may have two- and four - quark components as part of the usual fock state expansion .",
    "those two - quark and four - quark states are quantum - mechanically mixed , also likely with other potential candidates with the same quantum numbers . restricted to the 2-quark and",
    "4-quark mixtures , two complex decay amplitudes and several mixing angles are unknown and should be treated as input parameters , while only 3 physical observables are available from the experiments in principle .",
    "this mixing problem is not solvable and the proposed sum rules becomes useless .",
    "nevertheless our method is at least helpful to rule out one of the possibility .",
    "if the ratio @xmath164 were close to 1 , the pure 4-quark picture is likely to be ruled out but if the ratio @xmath164 were close to 3 the pure 2-quark picture is likely to be excluded .    in conclusion",

    "<S> in the su(3 ) symmetry limit , semileptonic @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are found to obey different sum rules in the @xmath5 and the tetra - quark descriptions for scalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> thus these sum rules can distinguish the two scenarios for light scalar mesons model - independently . </S>",
    "<S> this method also applies to the @xmath6 decays . </S>",
    "<S> two kinds of su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects are found to be under control , which will not spoil our method . </S>",
    "<S> the branching fractions of the @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays roughly have the order @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ongoing bes - iii and the forthcoming super b experiments are able to measure these channels and accordingly to provide detailed information of the scalar meson inner structure . </S>"
