    "some animals like the small nematode _",
    "caenorhabditis elegans _ have a mutation which is called _ dauer_. their study may help our understanding of ageing in general .",
    "finch and kirkwood discovered that ageing worms get randomly damaged cells , like humans , @xcite and herndon et al . claimed that old worms , like old people , suffer muscle decline @xcite .",
    "+ at the existence of a pheromone ( a measure of population density ) , high temperatures or a food shortage at the end of the second larvae stage , the _ nematode _ can go into a mutated third larvae stage being able to move but needing no food @xcite .",
    "this stage can be passed through 6 to 8 times until the conditions have improved @xcite .",
    "as the _ after - dauer _ life span is not influenced by the endurance of the larvae stage , scientists agree that the _ nematodes _ do not age during the _ dauer state _ @xcite",
    ". this paper deals with the question if the _ dauer mutation _ helps a population to preserve its species in bad times . for the dasgupta model ,",
    "this was already answered positively by heumann @xcite .",
    "the 1995 developed asexual penna model is a _ bit - string model _ , in which each genome of an individual is represented by a computer word of 32 bits .",
    "a bit set to zero represents a healthy gene , whereas a bit set to one symbolises a hereditary disease that becomes active in the `` year '' ( or other suitable time unit ) represented by the position of the bit .",
    "exceeds the number of active diseases a certain threshold , the individual dies @xcite .",
    "for further information about the asexual penna model see e.g. @xcite or @xcite . + the original penna model is now modified so that it contains an environmental condition after reaching a stable population . in this environmental condition",
    "each tenth summer is a bad one in which only 1% of the population survive . after this bad tenth summer , as an option in the program , up to three more bad summers can follow one after the other , each with a probability of 0.5 .",
    "furthermore the _ dauer mutation _ is included in the computer program so that all _ nematodes _ of age 3 ( representing the individuals in the third larvae stage ) do not die in these bad summers .",
    "the other parameters were chosen as in the program listed in @xcite , if not stated otherwise .",
    "a summer means approximately one day in the _ caenorhabditis elegans _ life , as its mean life span is about 20 days @xcite .",
    "in addition the _ dauer larvae _ do not age in this simulation .    as a result figure 1 shows the comparison between a population with _",
    "dauer _ and one without it .",
    "the population size is plotted versus the generations .",
    "+ the population with the _ dauer mutation _ survives the bad conditions showing extreme fluctuations , whereas the population without the _ dauer larvae _ dies out in the seventh bad summer .",
    "figure 2 shows the comparison between a population with and one without _",
    "dauer larvae _ at extreme conditions with up to four bad summers one after the other .",
    "this close - up shows the time between 4980 and 5020 generations . again the population with _ dauer _",
    "survives , the population without it is already extinct in the second bad summer .",
    "stauffer suggests a simple alternative to the penna model ( @xcite,@xcite ) that does not consider an explicit bit - string as genome . in this stauffer model only the minimal reproduction age @xmath0 and the genetic death age @xmath1 are transmitted from generation to generation @xcite .",
    "having achieved the minimal reproduction age , the individual produces offspring with the probability _ b _ @xmath2 with the parameter @xmath3 to avoid divergences and extinction of the population @xcite .",
    "thus the birth rate is the smaller the longer the reproduction phase of the parent is : _ fecundity - survival trade - off _ @xcite .",
    "the offspring inherits @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the parent with a mutation of @xmath4 `` year '' @xcite .",
    "+ the individuals reach at most their genetic death age @xcite .",
    "they can die with a _ verhulst probability _ representing food and space restrictions as in the penna model .",
    "the _ verhulst survival probability _ is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 the capacity of the ecosystem @xcite .",
    "+ programming this model showed that a small difference in the interpretation leads to relevant effects on the results obtained .",
    "whereas in stauffers program the individual can get its first child with the age @xmath7 , in my program the reproduction starts already with reaching @xmath8 .",
    "this difference results in a population that is about twice as high as in stauffers version .",
    "the mortality in both versions consequently shows differences indicating a slightly better exponential increase in stauffers interpretation .",
    "however both versions are regarded showing also differences in the simulation of the _ dauer larvae_. + in analogy to our simulation with the penna model an environmental condition and the _ dauer state _ are included .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 indicates how much of the population survives in the bad summer because of the environmental condition . in the case of the modified penna model a disastrous summer was simulated : @xmath10 .",
    "+ figure 3 shows populations with and without _ dauer mutation _ for disastrous summers with @xmath10 and summers with @xmath11 .",
    "it can be seen that all populations die out in stauffers version , whether they have _ dauer larvae _ or not , even when the summer with @xmath11 is not catastrophic .",
    "the _ dauer state _ helps here very little .",
    "figures 4 , 5 and 6 show my version with the same parameters as in figure 3 . in my version",
    "both populations also die out for @xmath10 , shown in figure 4 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates a population without _",
    "dauer _ dying out after a few bad summers at @xmath11 , whereas the population with the _ dauer state _ in figure 6 survives those conditions .",
    "+ the comparison of the two versions shows that a small difference in the interpretation of the model can lead to totally different results concerning the preservation of the species .",
    "this difference in the two versions introduces the question which parameters lead to a preservation of the _ dauer population _ in stauffers interpretation . as increasing the _ bad summer factor _",
    "@xmath9 up to @xmath12 still kills the population with _ dauer mutation _ , a change in the birth rate might show the advantage of the _ dauer larvae _ for the preservation of the species . iterating the birth loop twice in stauffers version ,",
    "provides the results in figure 7 for @xmath13 . whereas the population with _ dauer mutation _ survives the bad conditions , the population without it dies out ( the small dots ending near generation 10000 ) .",
    "+ analysis showed that for @xmath13 and higher the population with _",
    "dauer larvae _ survives , whereas the population without it dies out .",
    "is @xmath14 both populations are extincted .",
    "thus an increased birth rate in stauffers version leads to the preservation of the species for @xmath13 and higher .",
