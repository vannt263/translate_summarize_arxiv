    "in the effective light cone qcd theory  @xcite the lowest fock component of the hadron wave function is an eigenfunction of an effective mass squared operator with constituent quark degrees of freedom and parameterized in terms of an interaction which contains a coulomb - like potential and a dirac - delta term .",
    "all higher fock - state components of the hadron light - front wave function can be constructed recursively from the lowest one .",
    "the interaction in the mass operator comes from an effective one - gluon - exchange where the dirac - delta term corresponds to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the masses of the ground state of the pseudoscalar mesons and in particular the pion structure  @xcite were described reasonably , with a small number of free parameters , which is only the canonical number plus one  the renormalized strength of the dirac - delta interaction .",
    "this model was also extended to include the confining interaction and used to study the @xmath0-wave meson spectra universally  @xcite . in the light cone framework",
    "( mass squared operator appears in the hamiltonian ) , the confining harmonic oscillator potential gives a natural explanation of the observation of an almost linear relationship between the mass squared of excited states with radial quantum number @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we note that quite recently , another harmonic oscillator approach was also used in the description of scalar mesons successfully  @xcite .",
    "recently a new narrow resonance @xmath3(2317)@xmath4  was observed by the babar collaboration  @xcite and confirmed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "both the small mass and the small width are in conflict with predictions of many models  @xcite . since then much discussion has been made concerning this new meson state .",
    "some authors suggest that it is a four quark meson  @xcite .",
    "many others argue that it is still within the normal picture of meson , namely , consisting of two constituent quarks  @xcite .",
    "the effective light cone hamiltonian model  the light cone harmonic oscillator ( lch ) model proposed in  @xcite was also applied to this new meson  @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath3(2317)@xmath4  could be reproduced quite accurately by the lch model without changing the parameters fixed previously .",
    "the details of the application of this model in @xmath0-wave mesons were published in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "i will concentrate on @xmath1-wave @xmath2 mesons .",
    "compared to  @xcite , a more reasonable spin - orbit interaction was adopted here . in section  [ sec : swave ] , i briefly review the formalism of this model . the discussion on @xmath3(2317)@xmath4  is presented in section  [ sec : ds ] .",
    "finally i will give a summary .",
    "in the effective light cone qcd theory the bare mass operator equation for the lowest fock - state component of a bound system consisting of a constituent quark and antiquark with masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is described as  @xcite @xmath8    \\psi ( x,{\\vec k_\\perp } ) \\nonumber \\\\   &    & \\mbox { }    - \\int \\frac{dx ' d{\\vec k'_\\perp}\\theta(x')\\theta ( 1-x ' ) }                { \\sqrt{x(1-x)x'(1-x ' ) } }    \\left ( \\frac{4m_1m_2}{3\\pi^2 } \\frac{\\alpha}{q^2 }         - \\lambda - w_{\\rm{conf}}(q^2 )    \\right )    \\psi ( x',{\\vec k'_\\perp } ) \\ , \\label{p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass of the bound - state and @xmath10 is the projection of the light - front wave - function in the quark - antiquark fock - state . the confining interaction is included in the model by @xmath11 .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath12 is the space - part of the four momentum transfer and the strength of the coulomb - like potential is @xmath13 .",
    "the singular interaction is active only in the pseudoscalar meson channel with @xmath14 as the bare coupling constant .",
    "the mass operator equation could be transformed to the instant form representation  @xcite and further simplified by omitting the coulomb term to the form  @xcite @xmath15 where the bare strength of the dirac - delta interaction is @xmath16 , and the mass squared operator is @xmath17          \\right )   \\ ,   \\label{mass4}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator potential is introduced as a confinement with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being two universal parameters valid for all mesons .",
    "the phenomenological spin - orbit term  @xcite is included for @xmath22 states which is zero for @xmath0-wave states and was omitted in @xcite .",
    "note that in  @xcite we used a much simpler spin - orbit interaction which also gives reasonable results for @xmath3(2317)@xmath4 .",
    "the eigenvalue of @xmath23 , i.e. , the mass squared of a vector meson or a @xmath22 meson , is given by @xmath24 ,   n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \\cdots .",
    "\\label{eq : masssquare}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 gives the spin - orbit splitting .    for pseudoscalar mesons ,",
    "the dirac - delta interaction is active thus the hamiltonian must be renormalized .",
    "one of the renormalization approaches is the @xmath26 matrix method  @xcite .",
    "the details is found in @xcite .",
    ".parameters for the light cone harmonic oscillator model .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 of the harmonic oscillator potential and the masses of up , down and charm quarks are fixed from the masses of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite , with the assumption of @xmath31 .",
    "strange and bottom quark masses are determined by the masses of @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mass of @xmath34 , 2.573 gev  @xcite is used to determine the parameter @xmath35 gev@xmath36 .",
    "the masses of the other three @xmath1 states are easily calculated from eqs .",

    "the lch model reproduces the available data very well .",
    "the data are available for other two @xmath1-wave @xmath37 states except @xmath34 the mass of which is used to determine the parameter @xmath38 for the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the calculated @xmath39 mass deviates from the datum by only 0.019 gev . remarkably , the present prediction for the mass of the lowest @xmath1 state @xmath3(2317)@xmath4  is in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "therefore from our model , @xmath3(2317)@xmath4  might still be a `` normal '' meson consisting of two constituent quarks which agrees with our previous conclusion  @xcite and many other recent works  @xcite .",
    "we applied the light cone harmonic oscillator ( lch ) model  a renormalized light cone qcd - inspired effective theory with a quadratic confinement in the mass squared operator  to study the meson spectra .",
    "the model was applied to the @xmath0-wave mesons from @xmath40-@xmath41 up to @xmath42-@xmath43  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the splitting between the light pseudoscalar and vector meson states is due to the strong short range attraction in the @xmath44 sector .",
    "the linear relationship between the mass squared of excited states with radial quantum number  @xcite is naturally explained .",
    "this model presents reasonable agreement with available data .",
