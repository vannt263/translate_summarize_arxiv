    "during the epoch of reionization , groups of star - forming regions generate significant numbers of ionizing photons , which may lead to hii regions many mpc in size @xcite .",
    "these ionized bubbles grow as further structure forms , eventually merging and causing full reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "conditions within these hii regions may be significantly different than in the surrounding neutral igm . for example , the temperature in these hii regions will be raised by photoionization heating , which is known to suppress star formation in low - mass haloes @xcite .",
    "also , the ionizing flux generates more free electrons , which affects the abundance of molecular hydrogen @xcite , an important coolant .",
    "these , and other feedback mechanisms , will affect the fraction of baryons that condense in haloes , and in turn modify the number density of directly observable galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suppression will be inherently inhomogeneous , as highly biased regions will ionize first @xcite .",
    "understanding the detailed effects of feedback is one of the major remaining challenges in understanding galaxy formation .",
    "galaxies formed during reionization will be low in mass and faint by comparison to those from later generations of galaxy formation .",
    "this , along with absorption along the line of sight by the igm , makes it difficult for existing telescope facilities to detect large numbers of early galaxies directly .",
    "however , a number of large galaxy surveys now exist , which probe the distribution of galaxies in the lower - redshift regime @xcite .",
    "these surveys focus on high - mass luminous objects ",
    "e.g. , luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in sdss @xcite  which are easily detected",
    ". the abundance of such objects will depend in a non - trivial way upon the number of low - mass progenitors , especially upon the amount of condensed gas available for mergers .",
    "thus , these late - forming galaxies will , indirectly , be affected by the efficiency of galaxy formation during reionization .",
    "motivated by these arguments , we consider the possibility that large galaxy surveys in the low - redshift universe may be used to probe inhomogeneous reionization through its feedback on early galaxy formation .",
    "the many uncertainties remaining in our understanding of galaxy formation make it difficult to develop a rigourous formalism for this imprint , and motivate a simpler , hopefully more robust , approach .    besides the possibility of detecting reionization , its imprint in the galaxy power spectrum may act as a source of noise when probing cosmology .",
    "modern observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite have greatly extended our knowledge of cosmological parameters .",
    "one result has been the realisation that @xmath4 of the universe is composed of an unknown form of energy that generates the accelerated expansion seen in sn ia observations @xcite .",
    "this is one of the most puzzling discoveries of our times , and it is hoped that future observations in the fields of sn ia @xcite , weak lensing @xcite , and galaxy surveys @xcite will constrain the time evolution of the dark energy giving clues as to its nature .",
    "for this reason , in this paper , we will focus on how reionization may affect estimates of dark - energy parameters .",
    "large galaxy surveys contribute information on the dark energy in two main ways .",
    "first the form of the matter power spectrum , probed by galaxy surveys via the proxy of the galaxy power spectrum , depends on different parameter combinations than the cmb , breaking many of the parameter degeneracies @xcite .",
    "secondly , the pre - recombination oscillation of the photon - baryon fluid leaves an imprint in the matter power spectrum , which may be used as a standard ruler to determine the angular diameter distance @xmath5 as a function of redshift @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these baryon oscillations have now been detected @xcite by both 2df and sdss . if the imprint in the galaxy power spectrum from patchy reionization can mimic or conceal any feature of the galaxy power spectrum from density fluctuations , then our ability to constrain dark energy using galaxy surveys will be degraded .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possible consequences of this environmental dependence on the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the process of galaxy formation is still only poorly understood and so a detailed analysis of feedback is inappropriate .",
    "instead we choose to link galaxy formation to the neutral fraction by a simple _ ansatz _ ,",
    "by which we hope to bring out the underlying behaviour , leaving the details for a later age . in keeping with this",
    " simple is best \" ideology , we choose to model the variation in neutral fraction using an analogue of the halo model @xcite . with this approach",
    "we hope to phrase the problem in a general fashion , avoiding detailed assumptions about the reionization history . to address these questions in a quantitative fashion ,",
    "we employ the fisher - matrix formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to convert a theoretical model into predictions for the parameter constraints attainable by imagined experiments .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : bubble ] we detail the form of the ionization power spectrum and describe our simple _",
    "ansatz _ relating it to galaxy formation .",
    "then , in  [ sec : power ] , we bring the two together describing the complete model galaxy power spectrum , including the effects of redshift distortions and the alcock - paczynski effect . in ",
    "[ sec : fisher ] we outline the fisher - matrix formalism . having set out our model , in  [ sec : detect ] we discuss the possibility of detecting reionization using galaxy surveys .",
    "this is then expanded to consider the implications for dark - energy constraints in  [ sec : dark ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclude ] we summarise our conclusions .",
    "we wish to relate the overdensity of galaxies to the ionization fraction within a given region . to do this",
    ", we make the simple _ ansatz _ that there is a component to the galaxy power spectrum which linearly traces the ionized fraction .",
    "hence , we may write the number density of galaxies @xmath7 at position @xmath8 as @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mean number density of galaxies , @xmath11 assumes galaxies trace the underlying dark - matter fluctuations @xmath12 with bias @xmath13 , and we calculate the fractional overdensity of galaxies due to an ionization field @xmath14 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 parametrizes the strength of the effect .    writing the number density in the form of equation leads to a galaxy power spectrum @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the filling fraction of the bubbles . for simplicity , we choose to neglect the cross - correlation , which will be smaller or comparable in size to the other terms and represents an unnecessary refinement given the simplicity of our toy model .",

    "typically , @xmath20 and we can neglect this correction and take @xmath21    we now need to calculate the bubble power spectrum @xmath22 . in order to phrase the problem as broadly as possible , we eschew detailed assumptions about reionization in favour of a more general approach . in this paper",
    ", we choose to associate regions of ionization with  bubbles , \" in analogous fashion to the halo model s association of mass with haloes . following the halo - model formalism @xcite , @xmath22 is given by the sum of two terms , @xmath23 , which describe correlations within the same bubble and between two different bubbles respectively .",
    "these terms are given by @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the comoving number density of bubbles of mass @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the power spectrum of bubbles of mass @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the bubble ionization profile @xmath32 . with this notation",
    ", we may write the volume filling factor of the bubbles as @xmath33 , and the bubble volume as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the comoving bubble radius . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume a top - hat profile @xmath36 , for which @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a spherical bessel function of order @xmath39 .",
    "if we assume a delta - function size distribution and treat the power spectrum of the bubbles as tracing the dark - matter power spectrum @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the redshift at which the imprint is formed , this reduces to @xmath42 @xmath43 in order to keep our model simple , we ignore evolution in the bubble - size distribution . in reality",
    ", the relevant bubble sizes will be determined by the period when most baryons condense , an extended process that will average over the evolution of bubble growth .",
    "we also ignore the effects of bubble overlap , which is expected to occur for large @xmath18 and undermines the halo - model approach .",
    "once bubbles begin to overlap , using isolated spheres to model the hii regions will not correctly represent the true size and shape of the ionized regions . to a first approximation",
    "though , this effect will give an effective distribution of bubble sizes , and so should not affect our qualitative conclusions .",
    "we will take @xmath44 and @xmath45 in what follows , and use @xmath46 to parametrize the bubble power spectrum .",
    "note that the 2-bubble term is subdominant in the regime that we consider , making the details of @xmath41 , and any biasing of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath48 , unimportant .",
    "figure [ fig : bubble_power ] shows the form of the bubble power spectrum in this model .",
    "note that the power is fairly constant on small @xmath49 and cuts off sharply on linear scales smaller than the bubble radius . as",
    "a simple example of including a smooth bubble size distribution , figure [ fig : bubble_power ] shows @xmath50 calculated using the bubble distribution of @xcite , assuming an ionizing efficiency @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which gives a volume averaged bubble size @xmath53 .",
    "the main effects of the distribution in bubble sizes are to smooth out the oscillations seen in the single size model and to decrease the rate at which power decreases on scales below the characteristic bubble size . having shown that the high-@xmath49 cutoff occurs even with a smooth distribution of bubble sizes",
    ", we will henceforth restrict ourselves to the simpler , single bubble size case .",
    "+    the onset of non - linearity limits the scales that a galaxy survey is able to probe . we choose to define this cutoff scale by requiring that the average fluctuation on a scale @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55 for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this cutoff can lead to a degeneracy between the bubble spectrum and the constant shot - noise expected on large scales from non - gaussian clustering of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : bubble_power ] that on large scales the bubble power spectrum becomes constant .",
    "if , for a given galaxy survey , @xmath35 is sufficiently small , then the curvature of the bubble spectrum will lie at @xmath57 , and the bubble spectrum will be indistinguishable from shot - noise . including galaxy surveys at higher @xmath6 , where the non - linear scale is smaller",
    ", helps break this degeneracy .",
    "we note that , for a random variable with zero mean , we would expect the power spectrum to vanish on large scales .",
    "that this does not occur relates to a generic problem of the halo model 1-halo term , which is constant on large scales . in most applications",
    "this is masked by a dominant 2-halo term , which does decrease on large scales .",
    "however , in our model the 2-bubble term is negligible making this issue obvious . given that our model predicts a bubble power spectrum that looks like shot - noise on large scales , we must worry both about how the removal of shot - noise will affect our results and how to distinguish the effect of bubbles from shot - noise .",
    "as mentioned above , the existence of a cutoff in the bubble power spectrum distinguishes it from shot - noise ( although we must observe this cutoff for this to work ) .",
    "when we come to analyse the effect of bubbles on cosmological parameter estimation , we will include a term representing white shot - noise to account for this possible confusion .",
    "having generated an imprint from patchy reionization , we must evolve it to lower redshift .",
    "our knowledge of how mergers recycle matter from many smaller haloes into fewer more massive haloes is not sufficient to handle this rigorously .",
    "instead , we will consider three cases that ought to bracket the truth .",
    "we take @xmath35 to be a constant , fixing the shape of @xmath22 , and then consider how its amplitude varies with time .",

    "this means that @xmath59 becomes less significant at later times . in model b",
    ", we allow @xmath22 to grow as the square of the linear growth function @xmath60 .",
    "thus in model b , @xmath22 remains a constant fraction of the total galaxy power spectrum .",
    "it seems unlikely that the bubble imprint would grow in this fashion , but we include this model in order to consider the case where the bubble imprint is equally important at all redshifts .",
    "note that in this model , we choose to normalise the bubble spectrum to the present day .",
    "this provides a simple way of restricting @xmath22 to amplitudes comparable to the density power spectrum .",
    "finally , with model c , we consider the case where @xmath22 decreases with time .",
    "this will provide an estimate of the worst - case scenario for detecting the bubbles .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath22 is most important when we can compare surveys at different redshifts . in the case of a single redshift survey",
    ", any growth can be absorbed into an effective @xmath16 for that survey .",
    "what range of values may our two free parameters @xmath16 and @xmath35 reasonably take ?",
    "the characteristic size of the bubbles is the easiest question to address . @xcite",
    "present a model for bubbles forming around highly biased regions leading to typical sizes of @xmath61 , when @xmath44 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite use arguments based on light - travel times and cosmic variance to obtain bubble sizes of @xmath62 at the end of reionization . this latter value can be taken as an upper limit on reasonable bubble sizes , while the former gives a more reasonable estimate of what we might expect .",
    "these values are in broad agreement with the results of computer simulation @xcite , which yield sizes @xmath63 .",
    "the range of @xmath16 begs the question of how exactly to interpret this parameter .",
    "we have assumed a linear relation between the ionization fraction of a region and its galaxy overdensity .",
    "we can readily see that @xmath64 , which implies a solid upper limit of @xmath65 . an alternative approach is to consider the suppression of galaxy formation in haloes of low mass .",
    "simulations at low redshift ( @xmath66 ) @xcite indicate significant suppression of galaxy formation in haloes with circular velocities @xmath67 . at higher",
    "@xmath6 , photoionization is less effective due to the decreased cooling time , decreased uv flux , increased self - shielding from the higher densities , and collapse beginning before any uv background can be generated @xcite . in this case , @xcite find that only haloes with @xmath68 suffer significantly reduced condensation of baryons . to estimate the mass fraction in galaxies affected by photoionization feedback , we take this latter value and apply it to the press - schecter distribution @xcite as a low - mass cutoff below which no galaxies form .",

    "currently , the best hope for measuring the size of hii regions during the early stages of reionization lies with upcoming 21 cm observations ( e.g. , lofar , mwa , or past ) .",
    "direct imaging of the hii regions is unlikely with the first generation of detectors , but the prospects for statistical detection at @xmath167 are good ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at higher redshifts , @xmath168 ,",
    "corresponding to lower frequencies , sky noise increases dramatically making observations more difficult .",
    "an imprint directly upon the galaxy power spectrum avoids these technical issues , making possible a complementary measurement . in the event of very early reionization , detection of the imprint discussed in this paper",
    "might provide weak constraints on reionization before 21 cm experiments reach the desired sensitivity .",
    "current constraints on dark - energy parameters arise from the combination of high - precision cmb data with information from galaxy surveys .",
    "the combination of high-@xmath6 ( @xmath169 ) information , long before dark energy becomes dynamically important , with low-@xmath6 ( @xmath66 ) information , deep within the dark - energy - dominated regime , serves to break many of the degeneracies that either data set possesses when used alone . adding in more galaxy surveys at different redshifts further constrains the evolution of the dark energy , allowing constraints on both @xmath170 and its equation - of - state parameter @xmath171 . in the previous section , we considered the bubble imprint as a useful signal",
    "; in this section we consider it as a potential source of noise for galaxy surveys .",
    "if the bubble power spectrum is able to mimic the effects of dark energy , then it will degrade our ability to constrain dark - energy parameters . throughout this section",
    ", we will consider a dark - energy model with @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "our numerical results depend upon this choice of model , but the overall picture remains the same when @xmath174 and @xmath149 take other values .",
    "galaxy surveys provide direct constraints on the dark energy through both the baryon oscillations and from the alcock - paczynski effect .",
    "they also provide indirect constraints in combination with cmb data , as they probe @xmath140 independently of @xmath175 , the parameter directly probed by the cmb .",
    "this allows the cmb indication of flatness @xmath176 to constrain @xmath177 . the bubble imprint must interfere with one of these measurements to be a source of confusion .",
    "measurement of the baryon oscillations allow a determination of the angular - diameter distance .",
    "their distinctive oscillatory structure is very different from the smooth structure that we expect from any plausible bubble imprint and so we do not expect there to be any confusion between the two . the inferred peak position , amplitude , and overall shape of the galaxy power spectrum , on the other hand , could be affected by the smooth form of the bubble imprint , making these the most likely points of confusion .",
    "thus , we expect parameters such as @xmath140 and @xmath143 to be sensitive to the bubble imprint",
    ". this simple picture is modified by inclusion of cmb data , which places tight constraints on many of these parameters making the effect of the bubble imprint more subtle .",
    "the correlation between the different parameters is indicated in figure [ fig : fisherplot ] , for a model with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "note that there is a weak correlation between @xmath35 and the dark - energy parameters .",
    "a slightly larger covariance is seen between @xmath35 and @xmath143 . at larger values of ( @xmath154 ) ,",
    "the picture remains unchanged except for a breaking of the degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath16 as the cutoff in @xmath22 on small scales becomes more pronounced .",

    "this will be relevant only in the case that the bubble imprint is not easily detectable , as an obvious imprint would certainly be included in the data analysis .",
    "for the case where the bubbles are not detected ",
    "i.e. , @xmath181 and @xmath182  we have estimated this systematic offset between the inferred and true parameters , using the fisher matrix to approximate the full likelihood surface .",
    "we find that the offset is significantly smaller than the parameter uncertainty , typically being of order @xmath183 . from this , we conclude that failing to include the imprint should not systematically affect parameter estimates in the near future .",
    "when galaxy surveys begin to probe cosmological parameters below the percent level this effect will need to be included .",
    "we now turn to the effect of the imprint on parameter constraints .",
    "figures [ fig : werrormap ] , [ fig : time_werrormap ] , and [ fig : timeshrink_werrormap ] indicate error contours for @xmath174 over the ( @xmath154 ) plane .",
    "the same shading scheme is used in all three figures to allow easy comparison .",
    "first consider figure [ fig : werrormap ] .",
    "we see that the uncertainty on @xmath174 is maximal for bubble parameters @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the form of @xmath22 is plotted in figure [ fig : bubble_power ] where we see that it cuts off close to the maximum of the density power spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with our above statements .",
    "we find a maximum uncertainty of @xmath186 in contrast with the uncertainty @xmath187 in the absence of bubbles .",
    "this indicates that bubbles can be an important source of noise in attempts to constrain dark energy .",
    "the large values of ( @xmath154 ) required for this effect seem theoretically unlikely and from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : detect ] would allow direct detection of the bubbles .",
    "for more reasonable choices of bubble parameters ( @xmath161,@xmath188 ) , the uncertainty on @xmath174 reduces to @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the effect of the bubble imprint is likely to be somewhat important in future attempts to constrain dark energy .",
    "now consider figures [ fig : time_werrormap ] and [ fig : timeshrink_werrormap ] . the increased uncertainty in @xmath174 is more pronounced in model b , where the uncertainty rises as high as @xmath189 .",
    "even here , for small values of @xmath190 ) , the bubble imprint becomes unimportant and we recover @xmath187 , the no - bubble uncertainty .",
    "again this maximal uncertainty occurs close to @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the increased value of @xmath191 is a consequence of the bubble imprint growing at the same rate as the density fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the overall shape of the total galaxy power spectrum remains constant in time .",
    "thus , combining information at two redshifts provides much less leverage on separating out the two components , leading to larger parameter uncertainties . in model c",
    ", the damping of the imprint means that it has much less effect on the dark - energy parameters .",
    "+     +     +    finally , we note that figures [ fig : werrormap ] , [ fig : time_werrormap ] , and [ fig : timeshrink_werrormap ] display a region of decreased uncertainty in @xmath174 in the top right hand corner , when the bubbles are large and feedback strong .",
    "this is an interesting example of the ap effect . in this region",
    ", the bubble power spectrum dominates over the density contribution and the overall shape of the galaxy power spectrum displays a well defined , sharp cutoff .",
    "distortion of this scale by the ap effect places good constraints on the dark energy .",
    "galaxy surveys already show that the galaxy power spectrum closely traces the underlying density field , so this region is ruled out .    having considered dark - energy parameters , it would seem natural to also consider inflationary parameters ; e.g. , the tilt @xmath143 and amplitude @xmath180 .",
    "for the surveys that we have analysed , inclusion of the bubble power spectrum makes little difference to the uncertainty on these parameters .",
    "essentially , all of the information needed for constraining these quantities is contained within the cmb . in the absence of information on the optical depth @xmath144 , or",
    "if there are significant tensor modes , galaxy - survey information becomes important in breaking degeneracies .",
    "this is not true in the cases that we consider , where cmb - polarization information is well measured .",
    "if we were to try and use galaxy - survey data by itself , we would notice increased uncertainty in the tilt @xmath143 .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the possibility that patchy reionization may leave an imprint in the distribution of galaxies through its effect on the collapse and cooling of baryons .",
    "we considered a simple _ ansatz _ linking galaxy number density to the ionization fraction and used a halo - model approach to calculate the imprint of inhomogenous ionization on the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "we then applied a fisher - matrix approach to place constraints on the effect of this imprint .",
    "our calculation shows that detecting the bubble imprint through large galaxy surveys is potentially feasible , but highly dependent upon the details of reionization .",
    "we have shown that , for a detection to be possible with upcoming experiments , bubbles must be large ( @xmath165 ) and the feedback moderately strong ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "this suggests that the most reasonable region of parameter space ( @xmath161 , @xmath188 ) will not be detected with currently proposed galaxy surveys at @xmath192 .",
    "potentially , a @xmath193 galaxy survey might give the additional leverage needed for a concrete detection .    beyond the possibility of detection",
    ", we have considered the effect of the bubble imprint on constraining dark - energy parameters .",
    "we find that the distinctive nature of the baryon oscillations helps minimize any degeneracy arising .",
    "only if the characteristic bubble size is @xmath194 does the bubble imprint seriously impact our uncertainty in @xmath174 . in this case",
    ", the bubble power spectrum closely mimicks the cutoff of the density power spectrum .",
    "this is a region of parameter space where the bubbles should be easily detected . for more sensible values of ( @xmath35,@xmath16 )",
    ", there is little or no impact on dark - energy constraints . when the bubbles are not detectable , we find that ignoring them in the analysis of galaxy data does not introduce any significant biasing of the best - fitting parameters .",
    "our approach has emphasised the use of a simple toy model to probe the effect of reionization on the distribution of galaxies .",
    "if future galaxy surveys are able to make detections of this signal , it will be important to incorporate more detailed physics to better constrain the shape and amplitude of the bubble imprint . with our present understanding of reionization",
    ", this seems premature .",
    "future galaxy surveys will greatly add to our knowledge of the distribution of galaxies and the nature of the dark energy .",
    "if we are to extract maximum information from these surveys , we must tighten our understanding of the biasing of galaxy formation and the possible effect of reionization on early generations of galaxies ."
