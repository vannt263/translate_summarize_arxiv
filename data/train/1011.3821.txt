    "the dirac phase factor @xmath1 with a phase containing integrals over potentials ( of the general form @xmath2 ) @xmath1 is the standard and widely used solution of the usual gauge transformation equations of electrodynamics ( with @xmath3 and @xmath4 vector and scalar potentials respectively ) . in a quantum mechanical context",
    ", it connects wavefunctions of two systems ( with different potentials ) that experience the same classical fields , i.e. either systems that are gauge - equivalent ( a trivial case with no physical consequences ) , or systems that exhibit phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type ( magnetic or electric ) @xmath1 and then this dirac phase has nontrivial observable consequences .",
    "however , it has not been realized that the gauge transformation equations , viewed in a more general context , can have _ more general solutions _ than simple dirac phases , and these lead to wavefunction-_phase - nonlocalities _ that have been widely overlooked and that seem to have important physical consequences . in this paper",
    "we will briefly demonstrate these generalized solutions and will present cases ( and closed analytical results for the wavefunction - phases ) that actually connect ( or map ) two quantal systems that are * neither physically equivalent nor of the usual aharonov - bohm type*. we will also explore the consequences of the new ( _ nonlocal _ ) contributions ( that appear in the wavefunction - phases ) and will see that they are numerous and important ; they are also of a different type in static and in time - dependent configurations ( and in the latter cases they seem to lead to relativistically _ causal _ behaviors , that apparently resolve earlier paradoxes  arising in the literature from the use of standard dirac phase factors ) .",
    "let us first remind the reader of a property that is more general than usually realized@xmath0 the solutions @xmath5 of the @xmath6-dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation ( se ) for a quantum particle of charge @xmath7 that moves ( as a test particle ) in two distinct sets of ( predetermined and classical ) vector and scalar potentials ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) , that are generally spatially- and temporally - dependent [ and such that , at the spacetime point of observation @xmath10 , the magnetic and electric fields are the same in the two systems ] , are formally connected through @xmath11 with the function @xmath12 required to satisfy @xmath13 the above property can be immediately proven by substituting each @xmath14 into its corresponding ( @xmath15 ) time - dependent se ( namely with the set of potentials ( @xmath16))@xmath0 one can then easily see that ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) guarantee that both ses are indeed satisfied together ( after cancellation of a global phase factor in system 2 ) . [ in addition , the equality of all classical fields at the observation point , namely @xmath17 @xmath18 for the magnetic fields ( mfs ) and @xmath19 for the electric fields ( efs ) , is obviously consistent with all equations ( [ basic11 ] ) @xmath1 provided , at least , that @xmath20 is such that interchanges of partial derivatives with respect to all spatial and temporal variables ( at the point @xmath21 ) are allowed ] .",
    "the above fact is of course well - known within the framework of the theory of quantum mechanical gauge transformations ( the usual case being with @xmath22 , hence a mapping from a system with no potentials)@xmath23 but in that framework , these transformations are supposed to connect ( or map ) two _ physically equivalent systems _ ( more rigorously , this being true for ordinary gauge transformations , in which case the function @xmath12 , the so - called gauge function , is unique ( single - valued ) in spacetime coordinates ) . in a formally similar manner ,",
    "the above argument is also often used in the context of the so - called singular gauge transformations , where @xmath24 is multiple - valued , but the above equality of classical fields is still imposed ( at the observation point , that always lies in a physically accessible region)@xmath23 then the above simple phase mapping ( at all points of the physically accessible spacetime region , that experience equal fields ) leads to the standard phenomena of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) type , reviewed below , where _ unequal fields in physically - inaccessible regions _ have observable consequences . however , we should keep in mind that that above property ( ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) taken together ) can be _ more generally valid _ @xmath1 and , as already stated , we will present cases ( and closed analytical results for the appropriate phase function @xmath12 ) that actually connect ( or map ) two systems ( in the sense of ( [ basic1 ] ) ) that are * neither physically equivalent nor exhibiting the usual ab behaviors*. and naturally , because of the above provision of field equalities at the observation point , it will turn out that any nonequivalence of the two systems will involve _ remote _ regions of spacetime , namely regions that do _ not _ contain the observation point @xmath10 ( and in which regions , as we shall see , the classical fields experienced by the particle may be _ different _ in the two systems ) .    returning to the standard cases , usual @xmath24 s are given in terms of dirac phases , namely integrals over potentials .",
    "i.e. in static cases , and if , for simplicity , we start from system 1 being completely free of potentials ( @xmath22 ) , the wavefunctions of the particle in system 2 ( moving only in a static vector potential @xmath25 ) will acquire an extra phase with an appropriate gauge function  @xmath26 that must satisfy@xmath27 the standard ( and widely - used ) solution of this is the line integral @xmath28 ( which , by considering two paths encircling an enclosed inaccessible magnetic flux , formally leads to the well - known magnetic ab effect@xcite ) .",
    "it should however be stressed that the above is only true if @xmath29 is valid for * all * points @xmath30 of the region where the particle moves , i.e. if the particle in system 2 moves ( as a narrow wavepacket ) always outside mfs ( @xmath31 everywhere ) .",
    "similarly , if the particle in system 2 moves only in a spatially uniform scalar potential @xmath32 , the appropriate @xmath24 must satisfy @xmath33 the standard solution being @xmath34 that gives the extra phase acquired by system 2 ( this result formally leading to the electric ab effect@xcite by applying it to two equipotential regions , such as two metallic cages held in distinct time - dependent scalar potentials ) .",
    "once again however it should be stressed that the above is only true if @xmath35  is valid at * all * times @xmath6 of interest , i.e. if the particle in system 2 moves ( as a narrow wavepacket ) always outside efs ( @xmath36  at all times ) .",
    "( in the electric ab setup , the above is ensured by the fact that @xmath6 lies in an interval of a finite duration @xmath37  for which the potentials are turned on , in combination with the narrowness of the wavepacket@xmath23 and the assumption is that , during @xmath37 , the particle has vanishing probability of being at the edges of the cage where the potential starts having a spatial dependence .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix b of peshkin@xcite that demonstrates the intricasies of the electric ab effect , to which we return with an important comment at the end of this paper ) .    for potentials more general than in the above cases , ( and if , for notational simplicity , we restrict our attention to only one spatial variable @xmath38)@xmath39it is usually stated that the general gauge function that connects ( through a phase factor @xmath40 ) the wavefunctions of a quantum system with no potentials to those in a general set @xmath41 is the obvious combination ( and a natural extension ) of the above two forms , namely @xmath42 which , however , is generally * incorrect * for @xmath38 and @xmath6 uncorrelated variables@xmath0 it does * not * generally * * satisfy the standard system * *  * * ( [ basic11 ] ) ( viewed as a system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) ) , namely @xmath43 indeed@xmath0 ( i ) when the @xmath44 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath45 from the 1st term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 2nd term ( that survives because of the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath4 ) ; hence it invalidates the first of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "( ii ) similarly , when the @xmath46 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath47 from the 2nd term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 1st term ( that survives because of the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath48 ) ; hence it invalidates the second of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "it is only when @xmath48 is @xmath6-independent , and @xmath4 is spatially - independent , that eq.([wrong ] ) is correct .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the line integrals appearing in ( [ wrong ] ) do _ not _ form a path ( in spacetime ) that connects the initial to the final point ( see below ) .",
    "[ an alternative form that is also given in the literature is again eq.([wrong ] ) , but with the variables that are not integrated over implicitly assumed to belong to the initial point ( hence a @xmath49 replaces @xmath6 in @xmath3 , and an @xmath50 replaces @xmath38 in @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , one can see again that the system ( [ basicpde ] ) is _ not _ satisfied ( the above differential operators , when acted on @xmath24 , give @xmath51 and @xmath52 , hence _ not _ the values of the potentials at the point of observation @xmath53 as they should ) , _ this not being an acceptable solution either_. and in this case also there is no spacetime - path connecting the initial @xmath54 to the final point @xmath53 either , as the reader can easily verify ] .",
    "what is the problem here , or , better put , what is the deeper reason for the above inconsistency ?",
    "the short answer is the uncritical use of dirac phase factors that come from path - integral treatments ( where @xmath38 and @xmath6 are not * uncorrelated * variables , but actually correlated to produce a path @xmath55 ) .",
    "the general inadequacy of ( [ wrong ] ) was actually one of the main points that has motivated this work . by looking for the most general form of @xmath24 that solves the basic system of pdes we have recently found _ generalized results _ that actually _ correct _",
    "eq.([wrong ] ) in 2 ways@xmath0 through the proper appearance of @xmath50 and @xmath49 ( as in eq.([lambdastatic1 ] ) and eq.([lambdastatic2 ] ) of next section ) @xmath1 which happens to give a path - sense ( that connects the initial to the final point ) in either of the two solutions ( see fig.1 ) , being therefore consistent with feynman s path integral result in the special case of narrow - wavepacket states @xmath1 but most importantly , through the additional presence of _ novel nonlocal terms _ that had so far been overlooked@xcite .",
    "these generalized results are the * exact * solutions of the system ( [ basicpde ] ) but , even most importantly , the formulation ( and methodology of solution ) that produces them , if applied to @xmath56 ( in the 2-d static case ) and also to @xmath57 ( in the full dynamical 2-d case ) , leads to the exact ( nontrivial ) forms of the phase function @xmath24 that , apart from satisfying ( in all cases ) the system ( [ basicpde ] ) , seems to also have far reaching consequences for the wavefunction - phases in the schrdinger picture ( the most important being their causal behavior ) .    summarizing",
    ", we will see in this paper that the full form of a general @xmath24 goes beyond the usual dirac phases@xmath0 apart from integrals over potentials , it also generally contains terms of classical fields that act _ nonlocally _ ( in spacetime ) on the solutions of the @xmath6-dependent se . as a result , the phases of wavefunctions in the schrdinger picture are affected nonlocally by mfs  and efs @xmath1 nonlocal contributions that have apparently escaped from path - integral approaches .",
    "we will then focus on two types of application of the new formulation@xmath0 ( i ) application to particles passing through static mfs or efs will lead to cancellations of ab phases at the observation point ; these cancellations will be linked to behaviors at the semiclassical level ( to early experimental observations by werner & brill or to recent reports of batelaan & tonomura ) but will be shown to be far more general ( valid not only for narrow wavepackets but also for completely delocalized quantum states ) . by using them we will provide a new interpretation of semiclassical results and we will point out a number of sign errors in popular reports in the literature@xmath0 we will clearly show that semiclassical phase - differences picked up by classical trajectories ( deflected by fields ) are _ opposite _ ( and _ not _ equal , as usually stated or implied ) to the corresponding ab phase  ( due to the flux enclosed by the same trajectories ) .",
    "( ii ) application to @xmath6-dependent situations will provide a remedy for a number of misconceptions ( on improper use of simple dirac phase factors ) propagating in the literature ( feynman , erlichson and others ) , and will lead to nontrivially extended phases that contain an ab part and a nonlocal field - part@xmath0 their competition will be shown to recover relativistic causality in earlier paradoxes  ( such as the van kampen thought - experiment ) and will provide a fully quantitative formulation of peshkin s qualitative discussion ( on expected causal behavior ) in the electric ab effect ( discussion that was also based on a simple dirac phase factor ) .",
    "the temporal nonlocalities found in this work demonstrate in part _ a causal propagation of phases of quantum wavefunctions in the schrdinger picture _",
    "( through the well - known causal propagation of fields ) , something that may open a new and direct way for addressing @xmath6-dependent double - slit experiments and the associated causal issues .",
    "let us first consider 1-d cases and find the proper @xmath58 that takes us from ( maps ) a system in a set ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) to a set ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) .",
    "as already emphasized , we must assume that at the point @xmath53 of observation we have equal efs , i.e. @xmath63 , but we will _ not _ exclude the possibility of the two systems passing through _ different _ efs in other regions of spacetime ( that do _ not _ contain the observation point ) .",
    "in fact , this possibility will _ come out naturally _ from a careful solution of the basic pdes , namely@xmath64 @xmath65 this system is underdetermined in the sense that we only have knowledge of @xmath24 at an initial point @xmath54 and with no further boundary conditions ( hence multiplicities of solutions being generally expected , see below ) . by following a careful procedure of integrations@xcite",
    "we finally obtain 2 distinct solutions ( depending on which eq .",
    "we integrate first)@xmath0 the first solution is @xmath66 with@xmath67 required to be chosen so that the quantity@xmath68  is indep . of @xmath38 , and",
    "the second solution is @xmath69 with@xmath70 to be chosen in such a way that@xmath71is indep . of @xmath6 .",
    "we can directly verify that ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) or ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) are indeed solutions of the basic pdes .",
    "[ for ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) we have ( even for @xmath72)@xmath0 @xmath73 satisfied trivially ( because @xmath74 is indep . of @xmath38 ) , and  @xmath75 , and then with the substitution @xmath76 we obtain @xmath77 . since the 2nd and 4th terms _",
    "cancel each other _ , and the 1st term is  @xmath78 we obtain @xmath79 @xmath80  we have directly shown therefore that the basic system of pdes is indeed satisfied by our _ generalized _ solution ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) * even for any nonzero * @xmath81  ( in regions @xmath82 ) .",
    "( note however that at the point of observation @xmath83 , signifying the essential fact that the fields in the two systems are identical ( recall that @xmath84 ) at the point of observation @xmath53 ) .",
    "it can similarly be shown that ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) is also a solution ] . in ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] )",
    "the placement of @xmath50 and @xmath49 gives a path - sense  to the line integrals in each solution ( each path consisting of 2 perpendicular line segments connecting @xmath54 to @xmath85 with solution ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) having a clockwise and solution ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) a counter - clockwise sense , see red and green arrow paths in fig.1)@xmath86this way a natural _ rectangle _ is formed , within which the enclosed electric fluxes  in spacetime appear to be crucial ( showing up as nonlocal contributions of the efs - difference from regions @xmath87 of space and time _ that are remote to the observation point _",
    "@xmath53 ) .",
    "these nonlocal terms in @xmath24 have a direct effect on the wfs phases at @xmath53 .",
    "the actual manner in which this happens is determined by the functions@xmath67 or@xmath70these must be chosen in such a way that they satisfy their respective conditions . in fig.1a",
    "we show an extended _ vertical _ striped-@xmath88-distribution ( the case of a 1-d capacitor that is arbitrarily charged for all time ) , where , for @xmath38 located outside ( and on the right of ) the capacitor , the simplest proper choices are @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( since the quantity @xmath91 is already indep . of @xmath38  ( a displacement of the @xmath53-corner of the rectangle to the right does not change the enclosed electric flux  @xmath1 hence the choice of @xmath89 ) but _ _ is not a constant__@xmath0 this enclosed flux depends on @xmath6 ( since it _ does change _ with a displacement of the @xmath53-corner upwards ) - hence the choice of @xmath92 above ) .",
    "these choices then of @xmath93 and @xmath92 lead ( through ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) ) to new ( generalized ) solutions for this particular field - configuration .",
    "we then note that the _ difference _ of the two solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) is _ zero _ ( the flux determined by the potential - integrals is exactly cancelled by the nonlocal term of efs ) , a cancellation effect that is important and that will be generalized below . for other shapes of @xmath88 the choices of @xmath93 and @xmath92",
    "will be different@xmath0 for an extended _ horizontal _ strip ( the case of a nonzero ef in all space that has a finite duration @xmath37 ) , proper choices ( for observation instant @xmath94 ) are @xmath95  and @xmath96 ( since the electric flux enclosed in the observation rectangle  now depends on @xmath38 , but not on @xmath6 ) @xmath1 or a more involved example would correspond to a triangular shape ( see fig.1b for the corresponding magnetic case to be discussed later ) , where the enclosed flux depends on _ both _ @xmath38 and @xmath6 ( but can be shown to be separable , see next section ) .",
    "as for the last constant terms @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( what we will call multiplicities ) , these are only present when @xmath24 is expected to be multivalued , i.e. in cases of motion in multiple - connected spacetimes , and are then related to the fluxes in the inaccessible regions : in the electric ab setup , the prototype of multiple - connectivity in spacetime , it turns out@xcite that @xmath99 enclosed electric flux , and if these values are substituted in ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) they cancel out the new nonlocal terms and lead to the usual electric ab result . in simple - connected spacetimes , it can be rigorously shown@xcite that solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) are equal ( with @xmath93 being equal to the @xmath6-indep .",

    "@xmath100 ) .",
    "the same method applied to static 2-d cases ( now for the system of pdes @xmath101 @xmath102 ) finally gives 2 general solutions@xcite@xmath0 the first is @xmath103 with  @xmath93 such that  @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 and the second is @xmath107 with @xmath108 such that  @xmath109 @xmath105 @xmath110 these results apply to cases where the particle goes through _ different _ perpendicular mfs ( recall @xmath111 ) _ in spatial regions remote to the observation point _ @xmath112 .",
    "one can again show that the 2 solutions are equal for simple - connected space , and for multiple - connectivity the values of multiplicities @xmath113 and @xmath114 cancel out the nonlocalities and reduce the above to the usual result of mere @xmath115-integrals along the 2 paths ( i.e. two simple dirac phases ) . for striped @xmath116-distributions , functions @xmath93 and @xmath108",
    "must be chosen in ways compatible with their above conditions ( as in the earlier @xmath53-cases)@xmath23 by then taking the _ difference _ of ( [ lambda(x , y)1 ] ) and ( [ lambda(x , y)4 ] ) we obtain that the ab phase  ( originating from the _ closed _ line integral of @xmath115 s ) is exactly cancelled by the nonlocal term of mfs .",
    "this is reminiscent of the cancellation of phases observed in the early experiments of werner & brill@xcite for particles passing through a mf ( a cancellation between the ab phase  and the semiclassical phase picked up by the trajectories ) , and our method seems to provide a natural explanation@xmath0 as our results are general ( and for delocalized states in simple - connected space they basically demonstrate the uniqueness of @xmath24 ) , they are also valid and applicable to states that describe wavepackets in classical motion , as _ was _ the case in werner & brill s work .",
    "the above cancellations can then be understood as a compatibility between the ab fringe - displacement and the trajectory - deflection due to the lorentz force ( i.e. the semiclassical phase picked up due to the optical path difference of the two deflected trajectories _",
    "exactly cancels _ ( is _ opposite in sign _ from ) the ab phase picked up by the same trajectories due to the flux that they enclose ) .",
    "this opposite sign seems to have been rather unnoticed@xmath0 in feynman s fig.15 - 8 @xcite , or in felsager s",
    "fig.2.16 @xcite , classical trajectories are deflected after passing through a strip of a mf placed on the right of a double - slit apparatus .",
    "both authors determine the semiclassical phase picked up by the deflected trajectories and find it consistent with the ab phase .",
    "one can see on closer inspection , however , that the two phases actually _ have opposite signs _",
    "( see our own fig.2 and the discussion that follows below , where this is proved in detail ) .",
    "similarly , in the very recent review of batelaan & tonomura@xcite , their fig.2 shows wavefronts associated to deflected classical trajectories where it is stated that the phase shift calculated in terms of the lorentz force is the same as that predicted by the ab effect in terms of the vector potential .",
    "once more , however , it turns out that the sign of the classical phase - difference is really opposite to the sign of the ab phase ( see proof below ) .",
    "the phases are not equal as stated by the authors . and",
    "it turns out that even electric analogs  of the above cases also demonstrate this opposite - sign relationship ( see proofs further below ) .",
    "all the above examples can be viewed as a manifestation of the cancellations that have been found in the present work for general quantum states ( but in those examples they are just special cases for wavepacket - states in classical motion ) .",
    "let us give a brief elementary proof of the above claimed opposite sign - relationships@xmath0 indeed , in our fig.2 , the ab phase  due to the flux enclosed between the two classical trajectories ( of a particle of charge @xmath7 ) is @xmath117 with @xmath118 the flux quantum , and @xmath119 the enclosed flux between the two trajectories ( for small trajectory - deflections ) , with the deflection originating from the presence of the magnetic strip @xmath116 and the associated lorentz forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the semiclassical phase difference between the same 2 classical trajectories is @xmath120 , with @xmath121 being the de broglie wavelength ( and @xmath122 being the speed of the particle , taken almost constant ( as usually done ) due to the small deflections ) , and with @xmath123 being @xmath124 ( @xmath125 being the ( displaced ) position of the central fringe on the screen ) .",
    "we have therefore @xmath126 now , the lorentz force ( exerted only during the passage through the thin magnetic strip , hence only during a time interval @xmath127 ) has a component parallel to the screen ( let us call it @xmath38-component ) that is given by @xmath128 which shows that there is a change of kinematic momentum ( parallel to the screen ) equal to @xmath129 or , equivalently , a change of parallel speed @xmath130 which is the speed of the central fringe s motion ( i.e. its displacement over time along the screen ) .",
    "although this has been caused by the presence of the thin deflecting magnetic strip , this displacement is occuring uniformly during a time interval @xmath131 and this time interval must satisfy @xmath132 ( as , for small displacements , the wps travel most of the time in uniform motion , i.e. @xmath133 ) .",

    "the electric type of ab phase is now @xmath147 with @xmath148 being the electric potential difference between the two trajectories , hence @xmath149 ( again for small trajectory - deflections ) . on the other hand , the semiclassical phase difference between the two trajectories is again given by ( [ semiphase ] ) , but the position @xmath125 of the central fringe",
    "must now be determined by the ef force @xmath150 the change of kinematic momentum ( always parallel to the screen ) is now @xmath151 , hence the analog of ( [ dvx ] ) is now @xmath152 which if combined with ( [ dvx2 ] ) ( that is obviously valid in this case as well , again for small deflections , due to the @xmath153 ) , and always with @xmath146 , gives that the central fringe displacement must be @xmath154 , and using again @xmath155 , we finally have the following analog of ( [ xc ] ) @xmath156 by substituting ( [ xcnew ] ) into ( [ semiphase ] ) , the lengths @xmath137 and @xmath138 again cancel out , and we finally have @xmath157 , which with @xmath140 the flux quantum , and through comparison with ( [ abele ] ) leads once again to our final proof that @xmath158 we note therefore that even in the electric case , the semiclassical phase difference ( between two trajectories ) picked up due to the lorentz force ( exerted on them ) is once again opposite to the electric ab phase picked up by the same trajectories ( due to the electric flux that they enclose )",
    ".    we should point out once again , however , that although the above elementary considerations apply to semiclassical motion of narrow wavepackets , in this paper we have given _ a more general understanding of the above opposite sign - relationships _ that applies to general ( even completely delocalized ) states , and that originates from our generalized werner & brill cancellations .    in a slightly different vein , the cancellations that we found above give an explanation of why certain classical arguments ( invoking the past @xmath6-dependent history of an experimental setup ) seem to be successful in giving at the end an explanation of ab effects ( namely a phase consistent with that of a static ab configuration ) .",
    "however , there is again an opposite sign that seems to have been largely unnoticed in such arguments as well ( i.e. in silverman@xcite , where in his eq.(1.34 ) there should be an extra minus sign ) .",

    "superluminally_. indeed , the ab phase at any @xmath6 is determined by differences of @xmath186 with @xmath187 ( basically a special case of ( [ wrong ] ) ) . however , if we use , instead , our results above ( that contain the additional nonlocal terms ) , it turns out@xcite that , for a spatially - confined flux @xmath188 and for @xmath189 @xmath190 , functions @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 can all be taken zero@xmath39(their conditions are all satisfied ) , the point being that at instant @xmath6 , the @xmath194-field has not yet reached the spatial point @xmath112 of the screen @xmath1 a generalization of the striped cases that we saw earlier but now to the case of 3 spatio - temporal variables ( with now the spatial point @xmath112 being outside the light - cone defined by @xmath6 ( see fig.4))@xmath23 as the electric flux is independent of the upper limits @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath6 , this construction rigorously gives @xmath195 .",
    "moreover , the ab multiplicities ( at @xmath49 ) lead to cancellation of the @xmath116-terms ( always at @xmath49 ) , with the final result ( after subtraction of the 2 solutions ) being @xmath196 which , with @xmath197  the instantaneous enclosed magnetic flux and with the help of faraday s law @xmath198  gives @xmath199 although @xmath200 is generally @xmath6-dependent , we obtain the intuitive ( causal ) result that , for @xmath185 ( i.e. if the physical information has not yet reached the screen ) , the phase - difference turns out to be @xmath6-independent , and leads to the magnetic aharonov - bohm  phase that we _ would _ observe at @xmath49 .",
    "_ the new nonlocal terms have conspired in such a way as to exactly cancel the causality - violating ab phase _ ( that would be proportional to the instantaneous @xmath188 ) .",
    "this gives a resolution of the van kampen paradox  within a canonical formulation , without using any vague electric ab argument ( as there is no multiple - connectivity in @xmath53-plane ) .",
    "an additional physical element is that , for the above cancellation , it is not only the @xmath88-fields but also the @xmath6-propagation of the @xmath116-fields ( the full radiation field ) that plays a role@xcite .",
    "use of the other 10 solutions can also address bound - state analogs ( in @xmath6-driven 1-d nanorings ) or even electric  analogs of the van kampen case@xmath0 in peshkin s review@xcite , on the electric ab effect,@xmath39the author correctly states one can not wait for the electron to pass and only later switch on the field to cause a physical effect .",
    "although peshkin uses his eq.(b.5 ) and ( b.6 ) ( based on ( [ wrong ] ) ) , he carefully states that it is not the full solution ; actually , if we view it as an _ ansatz _ , then it is understandable why he needs to enforce a _ condition _ ( his eq.(b.8 ) , and later ( b.9 ) ) on the ef outside the cages ( in order for certain ( annoying ) terms ( resulting from a minimal substitution due to the incorrect ansatz ) to vanish and for ( b.5 ) to be a solution ) .",
    "but then he notes that the extra condition can not always be satisfied ( hence ( b.5 ) is not really the solution for all times ) , drawing from this the above qualitatively correct conclusion on causality .",
    "as it turns out , our treatment gives exactly what peshkin describes in words ( with the total radiation field  outside the cages being once again crucial in recovering causality ) , but in a direct and fully quantitative manner , and with _ no ansatz _ based on an incorrect form .",
    "we should also point out that improper uses of simple dirac phases appear often in the literature@xmath0 even in feynman@xcite it is stated that the simple phase factor @xmath201 is valid even for dynamic fields ; this is also explicitly stated in erlichson s",

    "there are no fields present , and the view holds in the literature@xcite that efs or mfs can not contribute directly to the phase .",
    "this view originates from the path - integral treatments widely used ( where the lagrangian determines directly the phases of propagators ) , but , nevertheless , our canonical treatment shows that fields _ do _ contribute nonlocally , and they are actually crucial in recovering relativistic causality .",
    "moreover , path - integral discussions@xcite of the van kampen case use wave ( retarded)-solutions for @xmath48 ( hence in lorenz gauge ) and are incomplete ; our results take advantage of the retardation of _ fields _ @xmath203 and @xmath204 * * ( true in _ any _ gauge ) , and _ not _ of potentials .",
    "in addition , troudet@xcite correctly states that his path - integral treatment is good for not highly - delocalized states in space , and that in case of delocalization the proper treatment would be much more complicated , and would require a much more complete analysis .",
    "such an analysis has actually been provided in the present work .",
    "it should be added that the van kampen paradox  seems to be still thought of as remarkable@xcite .",
    "the present work has provided a natural and general resolution , and most importantly , through nonlocal ( and relativistically causal ) propagation of wavefunction - phases .    on a broader significance of the new solutions",
    "we conclude that a causal behavior may exist at the level of quantum mechanical phases , enforced by the nonlocal terms ( through the well - known causal behavior of fields ) .",
    "the nonlocal terms found in this work at the level of @xmath24 reflect a causal propagation of wavefunction - phases _ in the schrdinger picture _",
    "( at least a part of them , the one containing the fields , that competes with the ab types of phases containing the potentials ) .",
    "this nonlocality and causality of quantum phases is an entirely new concept ( given the local nature but also the nonrelativistic character of the se ) and deserves to be further explored .",
    "possible immediate applications would be in @xmath6-dependent slit - experiments recently discussed using a completely different method ( with modular variables in the heisenberg picture)@xcite .",
    "it has been recently noted@xcite that physics can not currently predict how we dynamically go from the single - slit diffraction to the double - slit diffraction pattern ( whether it is in a gradual and causal manner or not ) .",
    "application of our nonlocal terms to such questions ( i.e. by introducing scalar potentials on the slits in a @xmath6-dependent way ) provides a completely new formulation for addressing causal issues of this type .",
    "finally , one can always wonder what the consequences of these new nonlocalities would be , if these were included in other systems of high - energy or condensed matter physics _ _ with a gauge structure__@xmath23 alternatively , it is worth noting that , if @xmath88 s were substituted by gravitational fields and @xmath116 s by coriolis force fields arising in non - inertial frames of reference , the above nonlocalities ( and their apparent causal nature ) could possibly have an interesting story to tell about quantum mechanical phase behavior in a relativistic / gravitational framework .",
