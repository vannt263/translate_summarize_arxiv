    "in this paper we develop a general microlocal framework which in particular allows us to analyze the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the wave equation on asymptotically kerr - de sitter and minkowski space - times , as well as the behavior of the analytic continuation of the resolvent of the laplacian on so - called conformally compact spaces .",
    "this framework is non - perturbative , and works , in particular , for black holes , for relatively large angular momenta ( the restrictions come _ purely _ from dynamics , and not from methods of analysis of pde ) , and also for perturbations of kerr - de sitter space , where ` perturbation ' is only relevant to the extent that it guarantees that the relevant structures are preserved . in the context of analysis on conformally compact spaces ,",
    "our framework establishes a riemannian - lorentzian duality ; in this duality the spaces of different signature are smooth continuations of each other across a boundary at which the differential operator we study has some radial points in the sense of microlocal analysis .    since it is particularly easy to state , and only involves riemannian geometry , we start by giving a result on manifolds with _ even _ conformally compact metrics .",
    "these are riemannian metrics @xmath0 on the interior of a compact manifold with boundary @xmath1 such that near the boundary @xmath2 , with a product decomposition nearby and a defining function @xmath3 , they are of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a family of metrics on @xmath6 depending on @xmath3 in an even manner , i.e.  only even powers of @xmath3 show up in the taylor series .",
    "( there is a much more natural way to phrase the evenness condition , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  1.2 ) . )",
    "we also write @xmath7 for the manifold @xmath1 when the smooth structure has been changed so that @xmath8 is a boundary defining function ; thus , a smooth function on @xmath1 is even if and only if it is smooth when regarded as a function on @xmath7 .",
    "the analytic continuation of the resolvent in this category ( but without the evenness condition ) was obtained by mazzeo and melrose @xcite , with possibly some essential singularities at pure imaginary half - integers as noticed by borthwick and perry @xcite . using methods of graham and zworski @xcite ,",
    "guillarmou @xcite showed that for even metrics the latter do not exist , but generically they do exist for non - even metrics .",
    "further , if the manifold is actually asymptotic to hyperbolic space ( note that hyperbolic space is of this form in view of the poincar model ) , melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite showed high energy resolvent estimates in strips around the real axis via a parametrix construction ; these are exactly the estimates that allow expansions for solutions of the wave equation in terms of resonances .",
    "estimates just on the real axis were obtained by cardoso and vodev for more general conformal infinities @xcite .",
    "one implication of our methods is a generalization of these results .    below @xmath9",
    "denotes ` schwartz functions ' on @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath10 functions vanishing with all derivatives at @xmath6 , and @xmath11 is the dual space of ` tempered distributions ' ( these spaces are naturally identified for @xmath1 and @xmath7 ) , while @xmath12 is the standard sobolev space on @xmath7 ( corresponding to extension across the boundary , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) , where these are denoted by @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is the standard semiclassical sobolev space , so for @xmath15 fixed this is the same as @xmath12 ; see @xcite .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : conf - compact - high ] for the full statement . )",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is an @xmath16-dimensional manifold with boundary @xmath2 with an even riemannian conformally compact metric @xmath0 .",
    "then the inverse of @xmath17 written as @xmath18 , has a meromorphic continuation from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , @xmath21 with poles with finite rank residues .",
    "if in addition @xmath22 is non - trapping , then non - trapping estimates hold in every strip @xmath23 , @xmath24 : for @xmath25 , @xmath26 if @xmath27 has compact support in @xmath28 , the @xmath29 norm on @xmath27 can be replaced by the @xmath30 norm .    further , as stated in theorem  [ thm : conf - compact - high ] , the resolvent is _ semiclassically outgoing _ with a loss of @xmath31 , in the sense of recent results of datchev and vasy @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this means that for mild trapping ( where , in a strip near the spectrum , one has polynomially bounded resolvent for a compactly localized version of the trapped model ) one obtains resolvent bounds of the same kind as for the above - mentioned trapped models , and lossless estimates microlocally away from the trapping .",
    "in particular , one obtains logarithmic losses compared to non - trapping on the spectrum for hyperbolic trapping in the sense of ( * ? ? ? * section  1.2 ) , and polynomial losses in strips , since for the compactly localized model this was recently shown by wunsch and zworski @xcite .    for conformally compact spaces , without using wave propagation as motivation , our method is to change the smooth structure , replacing @xmath3 by @xmath32 , conjugate the operator by an appropriate weight as well as remove a vanishing factor of @xmath33 , and show that the new operator continues smoothly and non - degenerately ( in an appropriate sense ) across @xmath34 , i.e.  @xmath2 , to a ( non - elliptic ) problem which we can analyze utilizing by now almost standard tools of microlocal analysis .",
    "these steps are reflected in the form of the estimate ; @xmath33 shows up in the evenness , conjugation due to the presence of @xmath35 , and the two halves of the vanishing factor of @xmath33 being removed in @xmath36 on the left and right hand sides .",
    "this approach is explained in full detail in the more expository and self - contained follow - up article , @xcite .",
    "however , it is useful to think of a wave equation motivation  then @xmath16-dimensional hyperbolic space shows up ( essentially ) as a model at infinity inside a backward light cone from a fixed point @xmath37 at future infinity on @xmath38-dimensional de sitter space @xmath39 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7 ) , where this was used to construct the poisson operator .",
    "more precisely , the light cone is singular at @xmath37 , so to desingularize it , consider @xmath40 $ ] . after a mellin transform in the defining function of the front face",
    "; the model continues smoothly across the light cone @xmath2 inside the front face of @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the inside of the light cone corresponds to @xmath16-dimensional hyperbolic space ( after conjugation , etc . ) while the exterior is ( essentially ) @xmath16-dimensional de sitter space ; @xmath2 is the ` boundary ' separating them . here",
    "@xmath2 should be thought of as the event horizon in black hole terms ( there is nothing more to event horizons in terms of local geometry ! ) .",
    "the resulting operator @xmath41 has radial points at the conormal bundle @xmath42 of @xmath2 in the sense of microlocal analysis , i.e.  the hamilton vector field is radial at these points , i.e.  is a multiple of the generator of dilations of the fibers of the cotangent bundle there .",
    "however , tools exist to deal with these , going back to melrose s geometric treatment of scattering theory on asymptotically euclidean spaces @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath42 consists of two components , @xmath43 , resp .",
    "@xmath44 , and in @xmath45 the images , @xmath46 , resp .",
    "@xmath47 , of these are sinks , resp .",
    "sources , for the hamilton flow . at @xmath48",
    "one has choices regarding the direction one wants to propagate estimates ( into or out of the radial points ) , which directly correspond to working with strong or weak sobolev spaces .",
    "for the present problem , the relevant choice is propagating estimates _ away from _ the radial points , thus working with the ` good ' sobolev spaces ( which can be taken to have as positive order as one wishes ; there is a minimum amount of regularity imposed by our choice of propagation direction , cf .",
    "the requirement @xmath25 above ) .",
    "all other points are either elliptic , or real principal type .",
    "it remains to either deal with the non - compactness of the ` far end ' of the @xmath16-dimensional de sitter space  or instead , as is indeed more convenient when one wants to deal with more singular geometries , adding complex absorbing potentials , in the spirit of works of nonnenmacher and zworski @xcite and wunsch and zworski @xcite .",
    "in fact , the complex absorption could be replaced by adding a space - like boundary , see remark  [ rem : add - bdy ] , but for many microlocal purposes complex absorption is more desirable , hence we follow the latter method .",
    "however , crucially , these complex absorbing techniques ( or the addition of a space - like boundary ) already enter in the non - semiclassical problem in our case , as we are in a non - elliptic setting .",
    "one can reverse the direction of the argument and analyze the wave equation on an @xmath16-dimensional even asymptotically de sitter space @xmath49 by extending it across the boundary , much like the the riemannian conformally compact space @xmath1 is extended in this approach .",
    "then , performing microlocal propagation in the opposite direction , which amounts to working with the adjoint operators that we already need in order to prove existence of solutions for the riemannian spaces , we obtain existence , uniqueness and structure results for asymptotically de sitter spaces , recovering a large part of the results of @xcite . here",
    "we only briefly indicate this method of analysis in remark  [ rem : asymp - ds ] .    in other words ,",
    "we establish a riemannian - lorentzian duality , that will have counterparts both in the pseudo - riemannian setting of higher signature and in higher rank symmetric spaces , though in the latter the analysis might become more complicated .",
    "note that asymptotically hyperbolic and de sitter spaces are not connected by a ` complex rotation ' ( in the sense of an actual deformation ) ; they are smooth continuations of each other in the sense we just discussed .",
    "to emphasize the simplicity of our method , we list all of the microlocal techniques ( which are relevant both in the classical and in the semiclassical setting ) that we use on a _ compact manifold without boundary _ ; in all cases _ only microlocal sobolev estimates _ matter ( not parametrices , etc . ) :    1 .",
    "microlocal elliptic regularity .",
    "2 .   real principal type propagation of singularities .",
    "_ rough _ analysis at a lagrangian invariant under the hamilton flow which roughly behaves like a collection of radial points , though the internal structure does not matter , in the spirit of ( * ? ?",
    "* section  9 ) .",
    "4 .   complex absorbing ` potentials ' in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these are almost ` off the shelf ' in terms of modern microlocal analysis , and thus our approach , from a microlocal perspective , is quite simple .",
    "we use these to show that on the continuation across the boundary of the conformally compact space we have a fredholm problem , on a perhaps slightly exotic function space , which however is ( perhaps apart from the complex absorption ) the simplest possible coisotropic function space based on a sobolev space , with order dictated by the radial points .",
    "also , we propagate the estimates along bicharacteristics in different directions depending on the component @xmath50 of the characteristic set under consideration ; correspondingly the sign of the complex absorbing ` potential ' will vary with @xmath50 , which is perhaps slightly unusual . however , this is completely parallel to solving the standard cauchy , or forward , problem for the wave equation , where one propagates estimates in _ opposite _ directions relative to the hamilton vector field in the two components .",
    "the complex absorption we use modifies the operator @xmath41 outside @xmath7 .",
    "however , while @xmath51 depends on @xmath52 , its behavior on @xmath7 , and even near @xmath7 , is independent of this choice ; see the proof of proposition  [ prop : hyp - resolvent - construct ] for a detailed explanation .",
    "in particular , although @xmath51 may have resonances other than those of @xmath53 , the resonant states of these additional resonances are supported outside @xmath7 , hence do not affect the singular behavior of the resolvent in @xmath7 . in the setting of kerr - de sitter space an analogous role is played by semiclassical versions of the standard energy estimate ; this is stated in subsection  [ subsec : local - wave ] .",
    "while the results are stated for the scalar equation , analogous results hold for operators on natural vector bundles , such as the laplacian on differential forms .",
    "this is so because the results work if the principal symbol of the extended problem is scalar with the demanded properties , and the imaginary part of the subprincipal symbol is either scalar at the ` radial sets ' , or instead satisfies appropriate estimates ( as an endomorphism of the pull - back of the vector bundle to the cotangent bundle ) at this location ; see remark  [ rem : bundles ] .",
    "the only change in terms of results on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces is that the threshold @xmath54 is shifted ; in terms of the explicit conjugation of subsection  [ subsec : conf - comp - results ] this is so because of the change in the first order term in .",
    "while here we mostly consider conformally compact riemannian or lorentzian spaces ( such as hyperbolic space and de sitter space ) as appropriate boundary values ( mellin transform ) of a blow - up of de sitter space of one higher dimension , they also show up as a boundary value of minkowski space .",
    "this is related to wang s work on b - regularity @xcite , though wang worked on a blown up version of minkowski space - time ; she also obtained her results for the ( non - linear ) einstein equation there .",
    "it is also related to the work of fefferman and graham @xcite on conformal invariants by extending an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold to minkowski - type spaces of one higher dimension .",
    "we discuss asymptotically minkowski spaces briefly in section  [ sec : minkowski ] .",
    "apart from trapping  which is well away from the event horizons for black holes that do not rotate too fast  the microlocal structure on de sitter space is _ exactly _ the same as on kerr - de sitter space , or indeed kerr space near the event horizon .",
    "( kerr space has a minkowski - type end as well ; although minkowski space also fits into our framework , it does so a different way than kerr at the event horizon , so the result there is not immediate ; see the comments below . )",
    "this is to be understood as follows : from the perspective we present here ( as opposed to the perspective of @xcite ) , the tools that go into the analysis of de sitter space - time suffice also for kerr - de sitter space , and indeed a much wider class , apart from the need to deal with trapping .",
    "the trapping itself was analyzed by wunsch and zworski @xcite ; their work fits immediately with our microlocal methods .",
    "phenomena such as the ergosphere are mere shadows of dynamics in the phase space which is barely changed , but whose projection to the base space ( physical space ) undergoes serious changes .",
    "it is thus of great value to work microlocally , although it is certainly possible that for some non - linear purposes it is convenient to rely on physical space to the maximum possible extent , as was done in the recent ( linear ) works of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "below we state theorems for kerr - de sitter space time . however , it is important to note that all of these theorems have analogues in the general microlocal framework discussed in section  [ sec : microlocal ] . in particular",
    ", analogous theorems hold on conjugated , re - weighted , and even versions of laplacians on conformally compact spaces ( of which one example was stated above as a theorem ) , and similar results apply on ` asymptotically minkowski ' spaces , with the slight twist that it is adjoints of operators considered here that play the direct role there .",
    "we now turn to kerr - de sitter space - time and give some history . in exact kerr - de sitter space and for small angular momentum , dyatlov @xcite has shown exponential decay to constants , even across the event horizon .",
    "this followed earlier work of melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite , where this was shown up to the event horizon in de sitter - schwarzschild space - times or spaces strongly asymptotic to these ( in particular , no rotation of the black hole is allowed ) , and of dafermos and rodnianski in @xcite who had shown polynomial decay in this setting .",
    "these in turn followed up pioneering work of s barreto and zworski @xcite and bony and hfner @xcite who studied resonances and decay away from the event horizon in these settings .",
    "( one can solve the wave equation explicitly on de sitter space using special functions , see @xcite and @xcite ; on asymptotically de sitter spaces the forward fundamental solution was constructed as an appropriate lagrangian distribution by baskin @xcite . )    also , polynomial decay on kerr space was shown recently by tataru and tohaneanu @xcite and dafermos and rodnianski @xcite , after pioneering work of kay and wald in @xcite and @xcite in the schwarzschild setting .",
    "( there was also recent work by marzuola , metcalf , tataru and tohaneanu @xcite on strichartz estimates , and by donninger , schlag and soffer @xcite on @xmath55 estimates on schwarzschild black holes , following @xmath55 estimates of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite , of blue and soffer @xcite on non - rotating charged black holes giving @xmath56 estimates , and finster , kamran , smoller and yau @xcite on dirac waves on kerr . )",
    "while some of these papers employ microlocal methods at the trapped set , they are mostly based on physical space where the phenomena are less clear than in phase space ( unstable tools , such as separation of variables , are often used in phase space though ) .",
    "we remark that kerr space is less amenable to immediate microlocal analysis to attack the decay of solutions of the wave equation due to the singular / degenerate behavior at zero frequency , which will be explained below briefly .",
    "this is closely related to the behavior of solutions of the wave equation on minkowski space - times .",
    "although our methods also deal with minkowski space - times , this holds in a slightly different way than for de sitter ( or kerr - de sitter ) type spaces at infinity , and combining the two ingredients requires some additional work . on perturbations of minkowski space itself ,",
    "the full non - linear analysis was done in the path - breaking work of christodoulou and klainerman @xcite , and lindblad and rodnianski simplified the analysis @xcite , bieri @xcite succeeded in relaxing the decay conditions , while wang @xcite obtained additional , b - type , regularity as already mentioned .",
    "here we only give a linear result , but hopefully its simplicity will also shed new light on the non - linear problem .",
    "as already mentioned , a microlocal study of the trapping in kerr or kerr - de sitter was performed by wunsch and zworski in @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important to us , as this is the only part of the phase space which does not fit directly into a relatively simple microlocal framework .",
    "our general method is to use microlocal analysis to understand the rest of the phase space ( with localization away from trapping realized via a complex absorbing potential ) , then use the gluing result of datchev and vasy @xcite to obtain the full result .    slightly more concretely , in the appropriate ( partial ) compactification of space - time , near the boundary of which space - time has the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes an extension of the space - time across the event horizon .",
    "thus , there is a manifold with boundary @xmath1 , whose boundary @xmath2 is the event horizon , such that @xmath1 is embedded into @xmath58 , a ( non - compact ) manifold without boundary .",
    "we write @xmath59 for ` our side ' of the event horizon and @xmath60 for the ` far side '",
    ". then the kerr or kerr - de sitter dalembertians are b - operators in the sense of melrose @xcite that extend smoothly across the event horizon @xmath2 .",
    "recall that in the riemannian setting , b - operators are usually called ` cylindrical ends ' , see @xcite for a general description ; here the form at the boundary ( i.e.  ` infinity ' ) is similar , modulo ellipticity ( which is lost ) .",
    "our results hold for small smooth perturbations of kerr - de sitter space in this b - sense . here",
    "the role of ` perturbations ' is simply to ensure that the microlocal picture , in particular the dynamics , has not changed drastically .",
    "although b - analysis is the right conceptual framework , we mostly work with the mellin transform , hence on manifolds without boundary , so the reader need not be concerned about the lack of familiarity with b - methods . however , we briefly discuss the basics in section  [ sec : mellin - lorentz ] .",
    "we _ immediately _ mellin transform in the defining function of the boundary ( which is temporal infinity , though is not space - like everywhere )  in kerr and kerr - de sitter spaces this is operation is ` exact ' , corresponding to @xmath61 being a killing vector field , i.e.  is not merely at the level of normal operators , but this makes little difference ( i.e. the general case is similarly treatable ) .",
    "after this transform we get a family of operators that e.g.  in de sitter space is elliptic on @xmath62 , but in kerr space ellipticity is lost there .",
    "we consider the event horizon as a completely artificial boundary even in the de sitter setting , i.e.  work on a manifold that includes a neighborhood of @xmath63 , hence a neighborhood of the event horizon @xmath2 .",
    "as already mentioned , one feature of these space - times is some relatively mild trapping in @xmath62 ; this only plays a role in high energy ( in the mellin parameter , @xmath64 ) , or equivalently semiclassical ( in @xmath65 ) estimates .",
    "we ignore a ( semiclassical ) microlocal neighborhood of the trapping for a moment ; we place an absorbing ` potential ' there .",
    "another important feature of the space - times is that they are not naturally compact on the ` far side ' of the event horizon ( inside the black hole ) , i.e.  @xmath66 , and bicharacteristics from the event horizon ( classical or semiclassical ) propagate into this region .",
    "however , we place an absorbing ` potential ' ( a second order operator ) there to annihilate such phenomena which do not affect what happens on ` our side ' of the event horizon , @xmath62 , in view of the characteristic nature of the latter .",
    "this absorbing ` potential ' could _ easily _ be replaced by a space - like boundary , in the spirit of introducing a boundary @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , when one solves the cauchy problem from @xmath69 for the standard wave equation ; note that such a boundary does not affect the solution of the equation in @xmath70_t$ ] .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath66 has a well - behaved infinity , such as in de sitter space , the analysis could be carried out more globally . however , as we wish to emphasize the microlocal simplicity of the problem , we do not touch on these issues .",
    "all of our results are in a general setting of microlocal analysis explained in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , with the mellin transform and lorentzian connection explained in section  [ sec : mellin - lorentz ] . however , for the convenience of the reader here we state the results for perturbations of kerr - de sitter spaces .",
    "we refer to section  [ sec : kerr ] for details .",

    "such decay has been described by delicate separation of variables techniques , again see bony - hfner @xcite in the de sitter - schwarzschild and schwarzschild settings , but only away from the event horizons , and by dyatlov @xcite in the kerr - de sitter setting .",
    "thus , in these settings , we recover in a direct manner dyatlov s result across the event horizon @xcite , modulo a knowledge of resonances near the origin contained in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for small angular momenta one can use the results from de sitter - schwarzschild space directly to describe these finitely many resonances , as exposed in the works of s barreto and zworski @xcite , bony and hfner @xcite and melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite , since @xmath146 is an isolated resonance with multiplicity @xmath147 and eigenfunction @xmath147 ; this persists under small deformations , i.e.  for small angular momenta . thus , exponential decay to constants , theorem  [ thm : exp - decay ] , follows immediately .",

    "zworski in the semiclassical setting @xcite , one easily gets an analogue of theorem  [ thm : spatial - absorb ] in @xmath148 , with smoothness and the almost non - trapping estimates corresponding to those of wunsch and zworski @xcite down to @xmath149 for @xmath150 large .",
    "since a proper treatment of this would exceed the bounds of this paper , we refrain from this here .",
    "unfortunately , even if this analysis were carried out , low energy problems would still remain , so the result is not strong enough to deduce the wave expansion . as already alluded to , kerr space - time has features of both minkowski and de sitter space - times ; though both of these fit into our framework , they do so in different ways , so a better way of dealing with the kerr space - time , namely adapting our methods to it , requires additional work .    while de sitter - schwarzschild space ( the special case of kerr - de sitter space with vanishing rotation ) , via the same methods as those on de sitter space which give rise to the hyperbolic laplacian and its continuation across infinity , gives rise essentially to the laplacian of a conformally compact metric , with similar structure but different curvature at the two ends ( this was used by melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite to do analysis up to the event horizon there ) , the analogous problem for kerr - de sitter is of edge - type in the sense of mazzeo s edge calculus @xcite apart from a degeneracy at the poles corresponding to the axis of rotation , though it is not riemannian .",
    "note that edge operators have global properties in the fibers ; in this case these fibers are the orbits of rotation .",
    "a reasonable interpretation of the appearance of this class of operators is that the global properties in the fibers capture non - constant ( or non - radial ) bicharacteristics ( in the classical sense ) in the conormal bundle of the event horizon , and also possibly the ( classical ) bicharacteristics entering @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that the methods of melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite would be much harder to apply in the presence of rotation .    it is important to point out that the results of this paper are stable under small @xmath10 perturbations of the lorentzian metric on the b - cotangent bundle at the cost of changing the function spaces slightly ; this follows from the estimates being stable in these circumstances . note that the function spaces depend on the principal symbol of the operator under consideration , and the range of @xmath64 depends on the subprincipal symbol at the conormal bundle of the event horizon ; under general small smooth perturbations , defining the spaces exactly as before , the results remain valid if the range of @xmath64 is slightly restricted .",
    "in addition , the method is stable under gluing : already kerr - de sitter space behaves as two separate black holes ( the kerr and the de sitter end ) , connected by semiclassical dynamics ; since only one component ( say @xmath151 ) of the semiclassical characteristic set moves far into @xmath62 , one can easily add as many kerr black holes as one wishes by gluing beyond the reach of the other component , @xmath152 .",
    "theorems  [ thm : complete - absorb ] and [ thm : spatial - absorb ] automatically remain valid ( for the semiclassical characteristic set is then irrelevant ) , while theorem  [ thm : glued ] remains valid provided that the resulting dynamics only exhibits mild trapping ( so that compactly localized models have at most polynomial resolvent growth ) , such as normal hyperbolicity , found in kerr - de sitter space .    since the specifics of kerr - de sitter space - time",
    "are , as already mentioned , irrelevant in the microlocal approach we take , we start with the abstract microlocal discussion in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , which is translated into the setting of the wave equation on manifolds with a lorentzian b - metric in section  [ sec : mellin - lorentz ] , followed by the description of de sitter , minkowski and kerr - de sitter space - times in sections  [ sec : ds ] , [ sec : minkowski ] and [ sec : kerr ] . theorems  [ thm : complete - absorb]-[thm : exp - decay ] are proved in section  [ sec : kerr ] by showing that they fit into the abstract framework of section  [ sec : microlocal ] ; the approach is completely analogous to de sitter and minkowski spaces , where the fact that they fit into the abstract framework is shown in sections  [ sec : ds ] and [ sec : minkowski ] . as another option",

    "it is convenient to rehomogenize in terms of @xmath1355 . to phrase this more invariantly ,",

    "[ sec : microlocal ] , we are interested in @xmath574 , which corresponds to @xmath575 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to think of @xmath251 , and its rescaled hamilton vector field , as objects on @xmath1356 .",
    "thus , @xmath1386 we make the general discussion of subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] explicit .",
    "first , @xmath1387 in particular , for @xmath564 non - real , @xmath1388 implies @xmath1389 , i.e.  @xmath1390 , which means that @xmath910 is @xmath1391 i.e.  @xmath251 is semiclassically elliptic on @xmath1357 , but _ not _ at fiber infinity , i.e.  at @xmath1350 ( standard ellipticity is lost only in @xmath1392 , of course ) .",
    "explicitly , if we introduce for instance @xmath1393 as valid projective coordinates in a ( large ! ) neighborhood of @xmath48 in @xmath1394 , then @xmath1395 so @xmath1396 which automatically vanishes at @xmath1397 , i.e.  at @xmath1350",
    ". thus , for @xmath64 large and pure imaginary , the semiclassical problem adds no complexity to the ` classical ' quantum problem , but of course it does not simplify it .",
    "in fact , we need somewhat more information at the characteristic set , which is thus at @xmath1397 when @xmath579 is bounded away from @xmath146 : @xmath1398 which , as we have seen , means that for @xmath563 with @xmath930 one can propagate estimates forwards along the bicharacteristics where @xmath1399 ( in particular , away from @xmath47 , as the latter is a source ) and backwards where @xmath1400 ( in particular , away from @xmath46 , as the latter is a sink ) , while for @xmath1401 the directions are reversed .",
    "the directions are also reversed if @xmath579 switches sign .",
    "this is important because it gives invertibility for @xmath1402 ( corresponding to @xmath87 large positive , i.e.  the physical halfplane ) , but does not give invertibility for @xmath1403 negative .",
    "we now return to the claim that even semiclassically , for @xmath564 almost real ; as mentioned above , for @xmath579 uniformly bounded away from @xmath932 , we have ellipticity in @xmath1357 . ] , the characteristic set can be divided into two components @xmath583 , with @xmath48 in different components .",
    "as explained in subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] the vanishing of the factor following @xmath579 in gives a hypersurface that separates @xmath581 into two parts ; this can be easily checked also by a direct computation .",
    "concretely , this is the hypersurface given by @xmath1404 and so @xmath1405    we finally need more information about the global semiclassical dynamics . here all null - bicharacteristics go to either @xmath46 in the forward direction or to @xmath47 in the backward direction , and escape to infinity in the other direction .",
    "rather than proving this at once , which depends on the global non - trapping structure on @xmath1331 , we first give an argument that is local near the event horizon , and suffices for the extension discussed below for asymptotically hyperbolic spaces .",
    "as stated above , first , we are only concerned about semiclassical dynamics in @xmath1406 , where @xmath1407 might be close to @xmath146 . to analyze this",
    ", we observe that the semiclassical hamilton vector field is @xmath1408 here we are concerned about @xmath564 real .",
    "thus , @xmath1409 and @xmath1410 implies @xmath1411 , so @xmath1412 has a negative upper bound on the characteristic set in compact subsets of @xmath1413 ; note that the characteristic set is compact in @xmath1414 if @xmath1415 by standard ellipticity .",
    "thus , bicharacteristics have to leave @xmath1416 for @xmath1415 in both the forward and backward direction ( as @xmath1417 is bounded over this region on the characteristic set ) .",
    "we already know the dynamics near @xmath48 , which is the only place where the characteristic set intersects @xmath1418 , namely @xmath46 is a sink and @xmath47 is a source .",
    "now , at @xmath34 , @xmath1419 , which is positive when @xmath637 , so bicharacteristics can only cross @xmath34 in the inward direction . in view of our preceding observations , thus , once a bicharacteristic crossed @xmath34 , it has to tend to @xmath46 . as bicharacteristics in a neighborhood of @xmath46 ( even in @xmath1420 )",
    "tend to @xmath46 since @xmath46 is a sink , it follows that in @xmath151 the same is true in @xmath1406 for some @xmath1407 . on the other hand , in a neighborhood of @xmath47",
    "all bicharacteristics emanate from @xmath47 ( but can not cross into @xmath1421 by our observations ) , so leave @xmath1406 in the forward direction .",
    "these are all the relevant features of the bicharacteristic flow for our purposes as we shall place a complex absorbing potential near @xmath1422 in the next subsection .",
    "however , it is easy to see the global claim by noting that @xmath1423 , and this can not vanish on @xmath581 in @xmath1420 , since where it vanishes , a simple calculation gives @xmath1424 .",
    "thus , @xmath1425 has a constant sign on @xmath583 in @xmath1420 , so combined with the observation above that all bicharacteristics escape to @xmath1422 in the appropriate direction , it shows that all bicharacteristics in fact escape to infinity in that direction ] which is a smooth function on the characteristic set in @xmath1357 as @xmath1426 there ; further , it extends smoothly to the characteristic set in @xmath1356 away from @xmath48 since @xmath1427 vanishes only there near @xmath1350 ( where these are valid coordinates ) , at which it has conic points .",
    "this function arises in a straightforward manner when one reduces minkowski space , @xmath1428 with metric @xmath0 , to the boundary of its radial compactification , as described in section  [ sec : minkowski ] , and uses the natural escape function @xmath1429 there ; here @xmath1430 is the dual variable of @xmath1061 and @xmath1431 of @xmath1432 , outside the origin . ] .",
    "in fact , for applications , it is also useful to remark that for @xmath1433 , @xmath1434 indeed , as @xmath1423 , the hypotheses imply @xmath1435 and @xmath1436 , so we only need to show that @xmath1437 at these points . since @xmath1438 where the second equality uses @xmath1439 and the third uses that in addition @xmath1440 , this follows from @xmath1441 , so @xmath1384 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 can be used for gluing constructions as in @xcite .",
    "the final step of fitting @xmath41 into our general microlocal framework is moving the problem to a compact manifold , and adding a complex absorbing second order operator .",

    "thus , doubling over means working with the whole boundary , but putting an absorbing operator near the equator , corresponding to the usual cauchy hypersurface in minkowski space , and solving from the radial points at both the future and past light cones towards the equator  this would be impossible without the complex absorption .",

    "indeed , it is straightforward to write down @xmath250 with the required properties ( so @xmath250 is independent of @xmath64 ) , as we now do ; quantizing it in a standard @xmath64-independent manner gives a desired @xmath52 ; now @xmath52 depends holomorphically on @xmath64 ( since there is no @xmath64-dependence at all ) . concretely , as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] , this can be achieved by defining @xmath1453 , where @xmath1454 is a riemannian metric function ( or is simply a homogeneous degree 2 , positive function ) , @xmath971 , @xmath987 on @xmath1443 , is supported nearby , @xmath972 , letting @xmath1455 , @xmath976 supported near @xmath1456 , identically equal to a positive constant where neither @xmath1017 nor @xmath1018 vanishes .",
    "as @xmath1457 when @xmath1380 , on the set where @xmath1458 , @xmath1459 does not vanish ( for the vanishing of @xmath250 there implies that @xmath1457 , and @xmath1460 is always negative ) , while if @xmath999 , @xmath1461 so @xmath1459 does not vanish , and if @xmath987 , @xmath1462 behave the required way as @xmath1449 on @xmath50 .",
    "thus , renaming @xmath1463 as @xmath249 ( since we consider it an extension of @xmath249 ) @xmath1446 satisfy our requirements .    an alternative to this extension would be simply adding a boundary at @xmath1422 ; this is easy to do since this is a space - like hypersurface , but this is slightly unpleasant from the point of view of microlocal analysis as one has to work on a manifold with boundary ( though as mentioned this is easily done , see remark  [ rem : add - bdy ] ) .    for the semiclassical problem we need to increase the requirements on @xmath52 .",
    "as explained in remarks  [ rem : off - real - not - imp ] and [ rem : off - real - not - imp - for - exp ] , the main point is to ensure that the requirements for almost real @xmath564 , i.e.  @xmath577 ( corresponding to @xmath64 in a strip ) are satisfied . for this",
    "we need in addition , in the semiclassical notation , semiclassical ellipticity near @xmath1422 , i.e.  that @xmath1464 are elliptic near @xmath1447 , i.e.  near @xmath1422 , and which satisfies that the @xmath1465 on @xmath583 .",
    "while this is extremely easy to arrange if we ignore holomorphy in @xmath564 , a bit of care is required to ensure the latter .",
    "following , and taking into account , we take @xmath1466 with @xmath1467 @xmath1468 , @xmath976 is supported near @xmath1456 , and is identically @xmath147 in a smaller neighborhood of @xmath1456 , @xmath960 integer and the branch of the @xmath981th root function is chosen so that it is defined on @xmath1469 and is non - negative when the argument is non - negative , thus the real part of this root is @xmath268 on @xmath1469 with vanishing only at the origin .",
    "in fact , we can make @xmath52 the ( standard ) quantization of @xmath1470 where @xmath621 is chosen suitably large ; then @xmath52 is holomorphic away from the inverse images of the branch cuts , and in particular when @xmath1471 . here",
    "we can take even @xmath962 and then choose @xmath415 greater than the width of the strip we want to study .",
    "however , by allowing @xmath344 to vary , we obtain an open cover of @xmath20 by domains @xmath1211 of holomorphy for @xmath1212 as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : local - wave ] , and as @xmath1472 , subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] shows that @xmath1212 in fact satisfies the required semiclassical properties in @xmath1211 .",

    "if the operator is replaced by one on a neighborhood of @xmath1478 with full principal symbol ( including high energy terms ) @xmath1479 and @xmath5 a family of riemannian metrics on @xmath2 depending smoothly on @xmath33 , @xmath718 vanishing at @xmath34 , then the local behavior of this operator @xmath41 near the ` event horizon ' @xmath1480 is exactly as in the de sitter setting . if we start with a compact manifold @xmath1 with boundary @xmath2 and a neighborhood of the boundary identified with @xmath1481 with the operator of the form above , and which is elliptic in @xmath1 ( we only need to assume this away from @xmath1482 , say ) , including in the non - real high energy sense ( i.e.  for @xmath564 away from @xmath932 when @xmath1483 ) then we can extend the operator smoothly to one on @xmath1443 , @xmath1484 , which enjoys all the properties above , except semiclassical non - trapping .",
    "if we assume that @xmath28 is non - trapping in the usual sense , the semiclassical non - trapping property also follows .",
    "in addition , for @xmath1421 sufficiently small , also holds since @xmath1485 is small when @xmath1439 and @xmath1440 , for the former gives @xmath1486 , and then the latter gives @xmath1487 so the contribution of @xmath1488 to @xmath1489 , which can be large elsewhere even at @xmath34 , is actually small .",
    "the preceding subsections show that for the mellin transform of @xmath72 on @xmath38-dimensional de sitter space , all the hypotheses needed in section  [ sec : microlocal ] are satisfied , thus analogues of the results stated for kerr - de sitter space in the introduction , theorems  [ thm : complete - absorb]-[thm : exp - decay ] , hold .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that there is no trapping to remove , so theorem  [ thm : complete - absorb ] applies with @xmath52 supported outside the event horizon , and one does not need gluing or the result of wunsch and zworski @xcite .",

    ", as we have just seen , for @xmath1529 , @xmath1530 thus , the first half of the proposition ( including the non - trapping estimate ) follows immediately from the results of section  [ sec : microlocal ] .",
    "note also that this proves that every pole of @xmath53 is a pole of @xmath51 ( for otherwise would show @xmath53 does not have a pole either ) , but it is possible for @xmath51 to have poles which are not poles of @xmath53 .",
    "however , in the latter case , the laurent coefficients of @xmath51 would be annihilated by multiplication by @xmath1531 from the left , i.e.  the resonant states ( which are smooth ) would be supported in @xmath1532 , in particular vanish to infinite order at @xmath34 .    in fact , a stronger statement can be made : by a calculation completely analogous to what we just performed , we can easily see that in @xmath1420 , @xmath41 is a conjugate ( times a power of @xmath33 ) of a klein - gordon - type operator on @xmath16-dimensional de sitter space with @xmath34 being the boundary ( i.e.  where time goes to infinity ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath64 is not a pole of @xmath53 and @xmath1533 then one would have a solution @xmath128 of this klein - gordon - type equation near @xmath34 , i.e.  infinity , that rapidly vanishes at infinity .",
    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is a special case of a result of mazzeo and melrose @xcite , with improvements by guillarmou @xcite .",
    "the point is that first , we do not need the machinery of the zero calculus here , and second , the analogous result holds true on arbitary asymptotically hyperbolic spaces , with the non - trapping estimates holding under dynamical assumptions ( namely , no trapping ) .",
    "the poles were actually computed in ( * ? ? ? * section  7 ) using special algebraic properties , within the mazzeo - melrose framework ; however , given the fredholm properties our methods here give , the rest of the algebraic computation in @xcite go through .",
    "indeed , the results are stable under perturbations , provided they fit into the framework after conjugation and the weights . in the context of the perturbations",

    "we remark that although in order to go through without changes , our methods require the evenness property , it is not hard to deduce more restricted results without this . essentially one would have operators with coefficients that have a conormal singularity at the event horizon ; as long as this is sufficiently mild relative to what is required for the analysis , it does not affect the results .",
    "the problems arise for the analytic continuation , when one needs strong function spaces ( @xmath316 with @xmath299 large ) ; these are not preserved when one multiplies by the singular coefficients .",

    "this only matters for semiclassical purposes , and ( being smooth and non - zero in the interior ) the factor @xmath1558 multiplying from both sides does not affect any of the relevant properties ( semiclassical ellipticity and possible non - trapping properties ) , so can be ignored  the same is true for @xmath64 independent powers of @xmath33 .    to do so",

    "this is relevant because if we have an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with ends of different sectional curvature , the manifold fits into the general framework directly , including the semiclassical estimates .",
    "a particular example is de sitter - schwarzschild space , on which resonances and wave propagation were analyzed from this asymptotically hyperbolic perspective in @xcite ; this is a special case of the kerr - de sitter family discussed in section  [ sec : kerr ] .",
    "the stability of estimates for operators such as @xmath41 under small smooth , in the b - sense , perturbations of the coefficients of the associated dalembertian means that all the properties of de sitter - schwarzschild obtained by this method are also valid for kerr - de sitter with sufficiently small angular momentum .",

    "( since replacing @xmath1629 by @xmath1640 in the region we consider reverses the sign when relating @xmath1641 and @xmath1642 , the signs would agree with those from the discussion after ( * ? ? ?",

    "* equation  7.4 ) due to the way we need to propagate estimates .",
    "( this is explained below . )",

    "* equation  7.4 ) .",
    "thus , all of the analysis of section  [ sec : ds ] applies .    in particular , note that @xmath41 is elliptic inside the light cone , where @xmath1648 , and hyperbolic outside the light cone , where @xmath1649 .",
    "it follows from subsection  [ subsec : conf - comp - results ] that @xmath41 is a conjugate of the hyperbolic laplacian plus a potential ( decaying quadratically in the usual conformally compact sense ) inside the light cones , and of the klein - gordon operator plus a potential on de sitter space outside the light cones : with @xmath1650 , @xmath1651 we remark that in terms of dynamics on @xmath1652 , as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : mellin ] , there is a sign difference in the normal to the boundary component of the hamilton vector field ( normal in the b - sense , only ) , so in terms of the full b - dynamics ( rather than normal family dynamics ) the radial points here are sources / sinks , unlike the saddle points in the de sitter case .",
    "this is closely related to the appearance of adjoints in the minkowski problem ( as compared to the de sitter one ) .",
    "this immediately assures that not only the wave equation on minkowski space fits into our framework , wave propagation on it is stable under small smooth perturbation in @xmath1653 of @xmath1654 which have real principal symbol .",
    "further , it is shown in ( * ? ? ? * corollary  7.18 ) that the problem for @xmath233 is invertible in the interior of hyperbolic space , but with the behavior that corresponds to our more global point of view at the boundary , unless @xmath1655 i.e. @xmath1656 recall also from the proof of proposition  [ prop : hyp - resolvent - construct ] that @xmath51 may have additional poles as compared to the resolvent of the asymptotically hyperbolic model , but the resonant states would vanish in a neighborhood of the event horizon and the elliptic region  with the vanishing valid in a large region , denoted by @xmath1657 , @xmath1536 , there , depending on the support of @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath1658 the resonant states corresponding to these additional poles may have support in the elliptic region , but their coefficients are given by pairing with resonant states of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 vanishes in @xmath1535 then @xmath1659 only has the poles given by the asymptotically hyperbolic model .    to recapitulate",
    ", @xmath41 is of the form described in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , at least if we restrict away from the backward light cone and its adjoint ; as follows from the remark above regarding the sign of @xmath64 , for the operator here , the microlocal picture near the backward light cone is like that for the @xmath41 considered in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , and near the forward light cone like that for @xmath233 .",
    "it is thus fine to include both the backward and the forward light cones ; we just end up with a combination of the problem we study here and its adjoint , and with function spaces much like in @xcite .",
    "] . to be more precise , for the forward problem for the wave equation , the _ adjoint _ of the operator @xmath41 we need to study satisfies the properties in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , i.e.  singularities are propagated towards the radial points at the forward light cone , which means that our solution lies in the ` bad ' dual spaces  of course , these are just the singularities corresponding to the radiation field of friedlander @xcite , see also @xcite , which is singular on the radial compactification of minkowski space .",
    "however , by elliptic regularity or microlocal propagation of singularities , we of course automatically have estimates in better spaces away from the boundary of the light cone .",
    "we also need complex absorbtion supported , say , near @xmath1660 in the coordinates , as in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] ( i.e.  the role of @xmath33 there is played by @xmath299 ) .",
    "if we wanted to , we could instead add a boundary at @xmath1660 , or indeed at @xmath1661 ( which would give the standard cauchy problem ) , see remark  [ rem : add - bdy ] . by standard uniqueness results based on energy estimates , this does not affect the solution in @xmath1135 , say , when the forcing @xmath27 vanishes in @xmath796 and we want the solution @xmath128 to vanish there as well .",
    "we thus deduce from lemma  [ lemma : mellin - expand ] and the analysis of section  [ sec : microlocal ] :    let @xmath235 be a compact subset of the interior of the light cone at infinity on @xmath39 .",
    "suppose that @xmath121 is a lorentzian scattering metric and @xmath1662 is sufficiently close to @xmath1654 in @xmath1663 , with @xmath38 the dimension of @xmath39 .",
    "then solutions of the wave equation @xmath1664 vanishing in @xmath1640 and @xmath1665 have a polyhomogeneous asymptotic expansion in the sense of @xcite in @xmath235 of the form @xmath1666 , with @xmath1667 in @xmath10 , and with @xmath1668 with @xmath539 being a point of non - invertibility of @xmath41 on the appropriate function spaces . on minkowski space ,",
    "the exponents are given by @xmath1669 and they depend continuously on the perturbation if one perturbs the metric .",
    "a distributional version holds globally .    for polyhomogeneous @xmath27",
    "the analogous conclusion holds , except that one has to add to the set of exponents ( index set ) the index set of @xmath27 , increased by @xmath995 ( corresponding factoring out @xmath1670 in ) , in the sense of extended unions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5.18 ) .    here a compact @xmath235 is required since we allow drastic perturbations that may change where the light cone hits infinity .",
    "if one imposes more structure , so that the light cone at infinity is preserved , one can get more precise results .    as usual ,",
    "the smallness of the perturbation is only relevant to the extent that rough properties of the global dynamics and the local dynamics at the radial points are preserved ( so the analysis is only impacted via dynamics ) .",
    "there are no size restrictions on perturbations if one keeps the relevant features of the dynamics .    in a different class of spaces ,",
    "namely asymptotically conic riemannian spaces , analogous and more precise results exist for the induced product wave equation , see especially the work of guillarmou , hassell and sikora @xcite ; the decay rate in their work is the same in _ odd _ dimensional space - time ( i.e.  even dimensional space ) . in terms of space - time , these spaces look like a blow - up of the ` north and south poles ' @xmath1293 of minkowski space , with product type structure in terms of space time , but general smooth dependence on @xmath1671 ( with the sphere in @xmath1671 replaceable by another compact manifold ) . in that paper a parametrix is constructed for @xmath1672 at all energies by combining a series of preceding papers .",
    "their conclusion in even dimensional space - time is one order better ; this is presumably the result of a global ( as opposed to local , via complex absorbing potentials near , say , @xmath1673 ) cancellation .",
    "it is a very interesting question whether our analysis can be extended to non - product versions of their setting .",
    "note that for the mellin transform of @xmath1620 one can perform a more detailed analysis , giving lagrangian regularity at the light cone , with high energy control .",
    "this would be preserved for other metrics that preserve the light cone at infinity to sufficiently high order .",
    "the result is an expansion on the @xmath39 blown up at the boundary of the light cone , with the singularities corresponding to the friedlander radiation field .",
    "however , in this relatively basic paper we do not pursue this further .",
    "we now give a brief description of the kerr - de sitter metric on @xmath1674_r\\big)\\times{\\mathbb{s}}^2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath1675 are specified later .",
    "we refer the reader to the excellent treatments of the geometry by dafermos and rodnianski @xcite and tataru and tohaneanu @xcite for details , and dyatlov s paper @xcite for the set - up and most of the notation we adopt .    away from the north and",
    "south poles @xmath1676 we use spherical coordinates @xmath1677 on @xmath1678 : @xmath1679 thus , away from @xmath1680 , the kerr - de sitter space - time is @xmath1681 with the metric we specify momentarily .",
    "the kerr - de sitter metric has a very similar microlocal structure at the event horizon to de sitter space . rather than specifying the metric @xmath121 , we specify the dual metric",
    "; it is @xmath1682 with @xmath1683 constants , @xmath1684 , @xmath1685 while @xmath302 is defined for all values of the parameters @xmath1683 , with @xmath1684 , we make further restrictions .",
    "note that under the rescaling @xmath1686 @xmath1687 would have the same form , but with all the unprimed variables replaced by the primed ones .",
    "thus , effectively , the general case @xmath1688 is reduced to @xmath1689 .",
    "our first assumption is that @xmath1690 has two positive roots @xmath1691 , @xmath1692 , with @xmath1693 @xmath1694 is the de sitter end , @xmath1695 is the kerr end .",
    "since @xmath1596 is a quartic polynomial , is @xmath1696 at @xmath1314 if @xmath1697 , and goes to @xmath1698 at @xmath270 , it can have at most 3 positive roots ; the derivative requirements imply that these three positive roots exist , and @xmath1675 are the larger two of these .",
    "if @xmath1111 , is satisfied if and only if @xmath1699 . indeed ,",
    "if is satisfied , @xmath1700 must have a zero between @xmath1695 and @xmath1694 , where @xmath1596 must be positive ; @xmath1701 gives @xmath1702 , and then @xmath1703 gives @xmath1704 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath1699 , then the cubic polynomial @xmath1705 is negative at @xmath146 and at @xmath1706 , and thus will have exactly two positive roots if it is positive at one point , which is the case at @xmath1707 . indeed ,",
    "note that @xmath1708 is a cubic polynomial in @xmath1709 , and @xmath1710 , so @xmath1711 has a non - degenerate critical point at @xmath1702 , and if @xmath1712 , then the value of @xmath1596 at this critical point is positive . correspondingly , for small @xmath79 ( depending on @xmath1713 , but with uniform estimates in compact subintervals of @xmath1714 ) , @xmath1675 satisfying still exist .",
    "we next note that for @xmath79 not necessarily zero , if is satisfied then @xmath1715 must have a positive zero , so we need @xmath1716 i.e.   implies .",
    "physically , @xmath1717 is the cosmological constant , @xmath1718 the schwarzschild radius , with @xmath1240 being the mass of the black hole , @xmath79 the angular momentum .",
    "thus , de sitter - schwarzschild space is the particular case with @xmath1111 , while further de sitter space is the case when @xmath1719 in which limit @xmath1695 goes to the origin and simply ` disappears ' , and schwarzschild space is the case when @xmath1720 , in which case @xmath1694 goes to infinity , and ` disappears ' , creating an asymptotically euclidean end . on the other hand , kerr is the special case @xmath1720 , with again @xmath1721 , so the structure near the event horizon is unaffected , but the de sitter end is replaced by a different , asymptotically euclidean , end .",
    "one should note , however , that of the limits @xmath1722 , @xmath1723 and @xmath1724 , the only non - degenerate one is @xmath1723 ; in both other cases the geometry changes drastically corresponding to the disappearance of the de sitter , resp .  the black hole , ends .",
    "thus , arguably , from a purely mathematical point of view , de sitter - schwarzschild space - time is the most natural limiting case . perhaps the best way to follow this section then is to keep de sitter - schwarzschild space in mind .",
    "since our methods are stable , this automatically gives the case of small @xmath79 ; of course working directly with @xmath79 gives better results .",
    "in fact , from the point of view of our setup , all the relevant features are symbolic , including dependence on the hamiltonian dynamics . thus , the only not completely straightforward part in showing that our abstract hypotheses are satisfied is the semi - global study of dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the rescaled hamilton flow depends smoothly on @xmath79 , so it is automatically well - behaved for finite times for small @xmath79 if it is such for @xmath1111 ; here rescaling is understood on the fiber - radially compactified cotangent bundle @xmath1725 ( so that one has a smooth dynamical system whose only non - compactness comes from that of the base variables ) .",
    "the only place where dynamics matters for unbounded times are critical points or trapped orbits of the hamilton vector field . in @xmath1726 , one can analyze the structure easily for all @xmath79 , and show that for a specific range of @xmath79 , given below implicitly by , the only critical points / trapping is at fiber - infinity @xmath1727 of the conormal bundle of the event horizon @xmath2 . we also analyze the semiclassical dynamics ( away from @xmath1728 ) directly for @xmath79 satisfying , which allows @xmath79 to be comparable to @xmath1729 . we show that in this range of @xmath79 ( subject to and ) , the only trapping is hyperbolic trapping , which was analyzed by wunsch and zworski @xcite ; further , we also show that the trapping is normally hyperbolic for small @xmath79 , and is thus structurally stable then .",
    "in summary , apart from the full analysis of semiclassical dynamics , we work with arbitrary @xmath79 for which and holds , which are both natural constraints , since it is straightforward to check the requirements of section  [ sec : microlocal ] in this generality . even in the semiclassical setting , we work under the relatively large @xmath79 bound , , to show hyperbolicity of the trapping , and it is only for normal hyperbolicity that we deal with ( unspecified ) small @xmath79 .",
    "we now put the metric into a form needed for the analysis .",
    "since the metric is not smooth b - type in terms of @xmath1730 , in order to eliminate the @xmath1731 terms we let @xmath1732 with @xmath1733 near @xmath1675 . here",
    "@xmath1734 is a smooth function of @xmath1735 ( unlike @xmath1731 ! ) , that is to be specified .",
    "one also needs to specify the behavior in @xmath1592 bounded away from @xmath146 , much like we did so in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting ; this affects semiclassical ellipticity for @xmath64 away from the reals as well as semiclassical propagation there .",
    "we at first focus on the ` classical ' problem , however , for which the choice of @xmath366 is irrelevant .",
    "then the dual metric becomes @xmath1736    we write @xmath1737 , so @xmath1738 , and b - covectors as @xmath1739 so @xmath1740 note that the sign of @xmath1741 here is the _ opposite _ of the sign in our de sitter discussion in section  [ sec : ds ] where it was the dual variable ( thus the symbol of @xmath1742 ) of @xmath33 , which is @xmath1743 in the present notation , since @xmath1744 at the de sitter end , @xmath1745 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows @xmath1746 , so apart from the usual polar coordinate singularity at @xmath1747 , which is an artifact of the spherical coordinates and is discussed below , we see at once that @xmath121 is a smooth lorentzian b - metric . in particular , it is non - degenerate , so the dalembertian @xmath1748 is a well - defined b - operator , and @xmath1749 factoring out @xmath1750 does not affect any of the statements below but simplifies some formulae , see footnote  [ footnote : factor ] and footnote  [ footnote : subpr ] for general statements ; one could also work with @xmath302 directly .",
    "the mellin transform , @xmath41 , of @xmath1751 has the same principal symbol , including in the high energy sense , @xmath1752 with @xmath1753 so @xmath1754 for real @xmath64 .",
    "thus , @xmath1755    to deal with @xmath37 given by @xmath1756 ( @xmath1281 being similar ) , let @xmath1757 we can then perform a similar calculation yielding that if @xmath80 is the dual variable to @xmath1758 and @xmath226 is the dual variable to @xmath564 then @xmath1759 and @xmath1760 with @xmath1761 smooth and vanishing quadratically at the origin . correspondingly , by , @xmath41 is indeed smooth at @xmath1676 .",
    "thus , one can perform all symbol calculations away from @xmath1676 , since the results will extend smoothly to @xmath1676 , and correspondingly from now on we do not emphasize these two poles .",
    "in the sense of ` classical ' microlocal analysis , we thus have : @xmath1762      as already stated in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , it is often convenient to consider the fiber - radial compactification @xmath1725 of the cotangent bundle @xmath1763 , with @xmath1764 considered as the boundary at fiber - infinity of @xmath1725 .",
    "we let @xmath1765 with the sign inside the braces corresponding to that of @xmath1675 .",

    "thus , @xmath46 is a sink , @xmath47 a source .",
    "furthermore , in the classical sense , @xmath1380 is disjoint from the characteristic set in the region of validity of the form of the operator , as well as at the poles of the sphere ( i.e.  the only issue is when @xmath1735 is farther from @xmath1675 ) , so the characteristic set has two components there with @xmath48 lying in different components .",

    "we now check the hyperbolic nature of trapping for larger values of @xmath79 . with @xmath1820 , as above , @xmath1853 and in the region @xmath1592 this can be rewritten as @xmath1854 note that the first term would be just @xmath1855 in the original coordinates which are valid in @xmath1592 .",
    "thus , @xmath1856 correspondingly , @xmath1857 and equality on the right hand side implies @xmath1858 , so @xmath1859 , a contradiction , showing that in @xmath1827 , @xmath1826 can not vanish on the characteristic set .",
    "we now turn to @xmath1592 , where @xmath1860 thus , we are interested in critical points of @xmath1861 and whether these are non - degenerate .",
    "we remark that @xmath1862 which is a contradiction , so @xmath1863 does not vanish when @xmath251 and @xmath1826 do .",

    "thus , @xmath1890 giving the natural generalization of , allowing the application of the results of @xcite . since @xmath1826 can not vanish in @xmath1827 ( apart from fiber infinity , which is understood already ) , we conclude that @xmath1735 gives rise to an escape function , as in footnote  [ footnote : convex - escape ] , away from @xmath1891 which is a smooth submanifold as the differentials of the defining functions are linearly independent on it in view of , , and the definition of @xmath1032 ( as the latter is independent of @xmath1735 and @xmath1741 ) .",
    "the linearization of the hamilton flow at @xmath111 is @xmath1892 so by , the linearization is non - degenerate , and is indeed hyperbolic .",
    "this suffices for the resolvent estimates of @xcite for exact kerr - de sitter , but for stability one also needs to check normal hyperbolicity . while it is quite straightforward to check that the only degenerate location is @xmath1893 , @xmath1894 , the computation of the morse - bott non - degeneracy in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , in view of an overall sign difference between our convention and that of @xcite for the operator we are considering , @xcite requires the positivity of @xmath1895 for @xmath931 .",
    "( note that the notation for @xmath564 is also different ; our @xmath564 is @xmath1896 in the notation of @xcite , so our @xmath564 being near @xmath147 corresponds to the @xmath564 of @xcite being near @xmath146 . ) unlike the flow , whose behavior is independent of @xmath366 when @xmath564 is real , this fact does depend on the choice of @xmath366 .",

    "* proposition  2.1 ) , the result follows for kerr - de sitter spaces with angular momenta satisfying .",
    "the final step of fitting @xmath41 into a general microlocal framework is moving the problem to a compact manifold , and adding a complex absorbing second order operator .",
    "this section is _ almost completely parallel _ to subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] in the de sitter case ; the only change is that absorption needs to be added at the trapped set as well .",
    "we thus consider a compact manifold without boundary @xmath182 for which @xmath1903 is identified as an open subset with smooth boundary ; we can again take @xmath182 to be the double of @xmath1903 .",
    "as in the de sitter case , we discuss the ` classical ' and ` semiclassical ' cases separately , for in the former setting trapping does not matter , while in the latter it does .",
    "we then introduce a complex absorbing operator @xmath1444 with principal symbol @xmath250 , such that @xmath1445 with semiclassical principal symbol @xmath252 , and such that @xmath1446 is elliptic near @xmath1904 , i.e.  near @xmath1905 , the schwartz kernel of @xmath52 is supported in @xmath1906 for some sufficiently small @xmath1907 , and which satisfies that the @xmath1908 on @xmath1909 . having done this , we extend @xmath41 and @xmath52 to @xmath182 in such a way that @xmath1446 are elliptic near @xmath1910 ; the region we added is thus irrelevant . in particular , as the event horizon is characteristic for the wave equation , the solution in the exterior of the event horizons is _ unaffected _ by thus modifying @xmath41 , i.e.  working with @xmath41 and @xmath231 is equivalent for this purpose .    again , as in de sitter space , an alternative to this extension would be simply adding a boundary at @xmath1905 ; this is easy to do since this is a space - like hypersurface , see remark  [ rem : add - bdy ] .    for the semiclassical problem , when @xmath564 is almost real we need to increase the requirements on @xmath52 .",
    "as in the de sitter setting , discussed in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] , we need in addition , in the semiclassical notation , semiclassical ellipticity near @xmath1905 , i.e.  that @xmath1464 are elliptic near @xmath1904 , i.e.  near @xmath1905 , and which satisfies that @xmath1911 on @xmath1912 . following the general prescription of subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] , as well as the discussion of subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] , this can be achieved by taking @xmath52 the ( standard ) quantization of @xmath1913 where @xmath1914 is a _",
    "riemannian _ dual metric on @xmath182 , @xmath976 as in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] supported near @xmath1905 , @xmath621 is chosen suitably large , and the branch of the @xmath981th root as in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] .",
    "one can again combine @xmath249 with a riemannian metric function @xmath1915 , to replace @xmath249 by @xmath1916 , @xmath1917 , as in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] .",
    "we recall that in the proof of theorem  [ thm : classical - absorb - glued ] one also need to arrange semiclassical ellipticity ( i.e.  define an appropriate @xmath824 ) for an appropriate perturbation of @xmath251 at the trapped set , which is in @xmath62 ; we now make this more explicit .",
    "this is only an issue if @xmath564 is real ; otherwise the lorentzian nature of the metric means that @xmath251 itself is elliptic , as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : lorentz ] . to achieve this ,",
    "we want @xmath1918 elliptic on the trapped set ; since this is in @xmath1919 , we need @xmath1920 there .",
    "to do so , we simply add a microlocal absorbing term @xmath824 supported microlocally near the trapping with @xmath1921 having semiclassical principal symbol @xmath1918 .",
    "we _ do not _ need to arrange that @xmath824 is holomorphic in @xmath64 ; thus simply quantizing a @xmath1918 of compact support on @xmath239 and with smooth dependence on @xmath1922 suffices . then with @xmath52 as above",
    "( so we do not change @xmath52 ) @xmath231 is holomorphic , and its inverse is meromorphic , with non - trapping large energy estimates in closed cones disjoint from @xmath932 in the upper half plane , corresponding to the semiclassical estimates for non - real @xmath564 given in theorem  [ thm : classical - absorb - sector ] . to see that large energy estimates also hold for @xmath51 near @xmath932 , namely in @xmath635 , one considers @xmath1923 , which enjoys such estimates but is not holomorphic , and then use the semiclassical resolvent gluing of datchev - vasy @xcite together with the semiclassical normally hyperbolic trapping estimates of wunsch - zworski @xcite , to conclude the same estimates for @xmath51 . for @xmath79 as in ,",
    "the dynamics ( away from the radial points ) has only the hyperbolic trapping ( and for small @xmath79 , it is normally hyperbolic ) ; however , our results apply more generally , as long as the dynamics has the same non - trapping character ( so @xmath79 might be even larger as may not be optimal ) . note also that since the trapping is in a compact subset of @xmath1924 , we arranged that the complex absorption @xmath1925 is the sum of two terms : one supported near the trapping in @xmath62 , the other in @xmath1603 ; this is useful for relating our construction to that of dyatlov @xcite in the appendix .",
    "this completes the setup .",
    "now all of the results of section  [ sec : microlocal ] are applicable , proving all the theorems stated in the introduction on kerr - de sitter spaces , theorems  [ thm : complete - absorb]-[thm : exp - decay ] .",
    "namely , theorem  [ thm : complete - absorb ] follows from theorem  [ thm : classical - absorb - strip ] , theorem  [ thm : spatial - absorb ] follows from theorem  [ thm : classical - absorb - sector ] , theorem  [ thm : glued ] follows from theorem  [ thm : classical - absorb - glued ] . finally theorem  [ thm : exp - decay ] is an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thm : glued ] , the mellin transform result , corollary  [ cor : mellin - expand ] , in the kerr - de sitter setting , or the appropriately modified , as indicated in remark  [ rem : mellin - expand ] , version of proposition  [ prop : mellin - expand ] for general b - perturbations ( so @xmath73 may no longer be killing , and the space - time may no longer be stationary ) , together with the fact that @xmath1926 is time - like in @xmath1603 ( since @xmath1927 , considered as a quadratic form , evaluated at @xmath1928 , @xmath843 , @xmath1410 , @xmath1893 , is positive then ) and proposition  [ prop : wave - local ] .",
