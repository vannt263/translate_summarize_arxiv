    "<S> there has considerable progress in identifying the mechanisms responsible for long - term memory in glasses and other slowly relaxing systems , with processes such as domain coarsening and diffusion over random free energy landscapes now well established ( see _ e.g. _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , long - term memory has also been observed in a class of systems , namely the so - called _ extremally driven _ </S>",
    "<S> models , for which there is no obvious underlying mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a satisfactory state of affairs , as these models have applications covering a broad range of physically important situations , in particular to athermal and low temperature systems such granular media , flux creep _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ one may reasonably ask how we can ever expect to understand the real systems if even their simplified models behave in a way that can not be properly explained .    </S>",
    "<S> the defining characteristic of extremally driven models is that they are updated by identifying an ` active ' region of the system , and _ renewing _ this region whilst leaving the remainder unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> the active subsystem is chosen according to some kind of _ extremal _ criterion ; often it will be centred on the location of the minimum ( or , equivalently , the maximum ) of some spatially varying scalar variable , but other possibilities have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> models that belong to this class include invasion percolation  @xcite , the bak - sneppen model  @xcite and the granular shear model of trk _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , amongst others  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , both the bak - sneppen and granular shear models have been found to exhibit _ aging _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which indicates the existence of some form of long - term memory . </S>",
    "<S> the bak - sneppen model , along with many other extremally driven models , is _ critical _ in the sense that it has been placed by construction at a critical point ( _ i.e. _ a continuous phase transition ) of a broader phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the granular shear model of trk _ et al . _ is _ not _ critical , so if the same mechanism is responsible for both cases of aging , it can not be due to any of the properties of the critical state .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that extremal driving _ by itself _ is enough generate long - term memory , and claim that this is the true cause of the aging observed in the bak - sneppen and granular shear models . </S>",
    "<S> we further speculate that this mechanism is somewhat _ robust _ and that many other extremally driven models will also age ; to the best of our knowledge , such behaviour has never been looked for in the other models in this class . </S>",
    "<S> the central part of this work is the solution of the simplest extremally driven model , which is shown to age in a similar manner to that observed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the only mechanism in the model is the extremal driving , it is reasonable to infer that this is the cause of the long - term memory . </S>",
    "<S> a secondary aspect of this work is that the model can be _ exactly _ solved for all system sizes and times . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the finite size effects and transient behaviour to be explicitly calculated , which is rarely possible in systems exhibiting slow relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also hoped that this work will help to extend the relationship between extremal statistics and glassy relaxation that was originally stressed by bouchaud and mzard  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model to be studied here is defined as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the system consists of @xmath5 elements which are each assigned a single scalar variable @xmath6 , @xmath7 , drawn from the fixed probability distribution function @xmath8 . for every time step @xmath9 , the element with the smallest @xmath6 in the system is selected and _ renewed _ by assigning it a new value of  @xmath6 , which is drawn from @xmath8 as before . </S>",
    "<S> non - degeneracy is assumed , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ no two @xmath6 can take the same value , which is valid as long as @xmath5 is finite and @xmath8 contains no delta - function peaks . selecting the maximum rather than the minimum would result in entirely equivalent behaviour and </S>",
    "<S> we henceforth restrict our attention to the minimum case only . </S>",
    "<S> this minimal model can be viewed as a one - dimensional version of the granular shear model  @xcite , or equally as the bak - sneppen model without interactions  @xcite .    before solving the model , </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to describe the emergence of long - term memory in qualitative terms . </S>",
    "<S> for this system , as for any system subjected to extremal driving , the typical values of @xmath6 increase monotonically in time . </S>",
    "<S> this means that any recently renewed element is likely to have a smaller @xmath6 than the bulk , and hence a shorter than average lifespan until it is again renewed . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , elements that have not been renewed for some time will have a longer than average life expectancy . </S>",
    "<S> this separation between the shortest and the longest lived elements will become more pronounced as the system evolves and the average @xmath6 in the bulk increases . </S>",
    "<S> thus one might reasonably expect a broad distribution of relaxation times , and the possibility of long - term memory .    to put this picture into a more precise framework , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath10 be the probability to find the system in a state @xmath11 after @xmath12 updates , where @xmath13 [ more formally the probability is @xmath14 to simultaneously find the first variable in the range @xmath15 , the second in the range @xmath16 , _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ ] only one of the @xmath6 changes value during a single time step . </S>",
    "<S> thus to find @xmath17 from @xmath10 , one must integrate over the region of phase space in which each of the @xmath6 is the smallest and replace it with a value drawn from @xmath8 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18    where the @xmath19 function @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21    and @xmath22 is shorthand for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor of @xmath24 on the right hand side of ( [ e : master ] ) can be removed by making the change of variables , , giving    @xmath25    where @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 are here defined exactly as in ( [ e : master ] ) and ( [ e : defnmi ] ) , except with the @xmath6 replaced by @xmath27 . scaling @xmath8 out of the master equation in this manner </S>",
    "<S> reflects that , as in any extremally driven model , the dynamics depends only on the _ order _ of the @xmath6 and _ not _ their relative spacings ( note that there is no need to invoke universality to prove this result ) .    before proceeding to solve the master equation  ( [ e : rescaledmaster ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to state and prove the following identities . </S>",
    "<S> firstly ,    @xmath28    the @xmath29 case is trivial ( since @xmath30 is independent of @xmath31 ) , whereas for @xmath32 observe that @xmath33 over the entire range of integration , from which the result follows . </S>",
    "<S> another useful identity is    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the domain of space in which @xmath27 is the smallest , and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be proven by considering in turn each of the @xmath37 subregions of @xmath35 defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 @xmath40 . for each permutation of the @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the integral limits for each of the @xmath42 can be inserted and the integration evaluated . the final result ( [ e : id2 ] ) then follows from summing over all the possible permutations .    </S>",
    "<S> the rescaled master equation ( [ e : rescaledmaster ] ) can be solved inductively from the initial state @xmath43 by using the first identity ( [ e : id1 ] ) , giving    @xmath44    that this is correctly normalised can be checked using the second identity  ( [ e : id2 ] ) . since @xmath45 is symmetric in the @xmath20 and therefore the @xmath27 , the probability that any particular element in the system , say @xmath46 , is the smallest at a given time @xmath47 is just  @xmath48 . however , suppose it is known that @xmath46 is _ not _ the smallest at  @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath49 can then be found by setting @xmath50 to zero in @xmath51 , renormalising , and iterating ( [ e : rescaledmaster ] ) once . </S>",
    "<S> this three - step procedure can be repeated to find the following expression for @xmath52 , defined as the probability to find the system in a state @xmath11 at a time @xmath53 given that @xmath46 was not the minimum at any of the times @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    the corresponding probability that @xmath46 is the smallest , denoted here by @xmath56 , can be calculated by integrating ( [ e : qreturn ] ) over @xmath51 and using ( [ e : id2 ] ) ,    @xmath57    which is independent of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the probability of an element being renewed decreases with the time since it was _ last _ renewed , according to @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath56 also decreases with @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now in a position to calculate the physical quantities of interest , starting with the persistence @xmath60  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen element @xmath61 has the same value of @xmath6 at time @xmath12 that it had at @xmath62 . clearly , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , observe that @xmath60 only decreases when an element is renewed for the first time , so @xmath66 and hence from ( [ e : preturn ] ) ,    @xmath67    which defines the persistence exponent  @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the slow decay of @xmath60 shows that a significant proportion of the system will remain in its initial state until arbitrarily late times , already suggesting some form of long - term memory . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is no cut - off for finite system sizes ; @xmath60 asymptotically decays algebraically even for @xmath69 , as long as one averages over all possible initial conditions and histories </S>",
    "<S> .    the existence of aging can be most clearly expressed in terms of the two - time correlation function @xmath70 between the state of the system at times @xmath47 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> a suitable @xmath70 for this model is the probability that a randomly chosen element has the same value of @xmath6 at @xmath47 and @xmath53 [ so @xmath71 . as before , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 , @xmath73 and    @xmath74    after a short transient this scales as    @xmath75    that @xmath12 and @xmath47 only appear in the ratio @xmath76 is what we mean by _ </S>",
    "<S> aging_. finally , </S>",
    "<S> note that in the limit @xmath77 , the @xmath5-dependence of ( [ e : exactr ] ) and ( [ e : exactc ] ) can be removed by renormalising the timescale to @xmath78 , giving @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we have now achieved what we set out to do , _ i.e. _ demonstrate that even the simplest extremally driven model has long - term memory , as evident from the aging of @xmath70 in  ( [ e : scaling ] ) , and the slow decay of @xmath60  ( [ e : exactr ] ) . from this </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the extremally driven renewal is responsible for the aging observed in  @xcite and speculate that other extremal models , such as invasion percolation , may also age in a similar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be stressed that not all extremally driven models will necessarily exhibit aging . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is already known that including noise - like terms , by renewing randomly selected elements as well as the extremal one , introduces an exponential cut - off to the relaxation times and destroys the long - term memory ( this situation is realised in the mean - field version of the bak - sneppen model , for instance  @xcite ) . thus a useful step forward from this work might be to consider modified versions of the model , to see what physical processes may enhance or disrupt the effects of extremal driving . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we tentatively suggest that the following modifications might be particularly worthy of investigation : introducing quenched disorder [ by assigning each element its own generating distribution @xmath81 , allowing the values of @xmath6 before and after renewal to be correlated , and letting the time step between updates to depend on the @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially hoped that these and other enhancements could be treated within the exact framework developed here .    in summary , we have argued that systems which are renewed according to an extremal criterion should be expected to exhibit long - term memory , and have supported this claim by showing that even the minimal extremally driven model ages . </S>",
    "<S> expressions were found for the persistence @xmath60 and the two - time correlation function @xmath70 which corroborate these claims . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that this work also constitutes an instance where the extremal properties of a system of correlated random variables can be exactly computed . to our knowledge , this makes it one of few such systems known @xcite . </S>"
