    "the dimensionless positive parameter @xmath11 , assumed to be small ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , is defined by @xmath13 where , @xmath14 is the thickness of the plate , @xmath15 is the young modulus of the elastic material , @xmath16 is the poisson ratio , @xmath17 is the characteristic diameter of the plate , and @xmath18 is the absolute value of the density of the isotropic stretching force applied at the end of the plate @xcite . in three dimensions , problems",

    "conforming , nonconforming , and mixed finite element methods for fourth order problem have been extensively studied @xcite . however , its _ a posteriori _",
    "error estimation is a much less explored topic . even for the kirchhoff plate bending problem , the finite element _ a posteriori _ error analysis is still in its infancy . in 2007 , beir@xmath19o et al .",
    "@xcite developed an estimator for the morley element approximation using the standard technique for nonconforming element .",
    "later , hu et al .",
    "@xcite improved the methods of @xcite by dropping two edge jump terms in both the energy norm of the error and the estimator , and by dropping the normal component in the estimators of @xcite .",
    "therefore , a naive extension of the estimators in @xcite to the current problem may probably not be robust in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "designing robust _ a posteriori _ estimators is challenging , especially for singularly perturbed problems , since constants occurring in estimators usually depend on the small perturbation parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this motivates us to think about the question : what method and norm are suitable for the singularly perturbed fourth - order elliptic problem ? in the literature , @xmath20 is a widely used measure for the primal weak formulation .",
    "we recall _ a priori _ estimates in @xcite for boundary condition ( [ boundary condition2 ] ) and convex domain @xmath0 : @xmath21 hereafter , we use @xmath22 to denote a generic constant independent of @xmath11 with different value at different occurrence .",
    "this leads to @xmath23    multiply both sides of ( [ pde1 ] ) by @xmath10 , and then integrate over @xmath0 . using integration by parts and boundary condition ( [ boundar condition1 ] ) or ( [ boundary condition2 ] ) , we have from the poincar inequality that @xmath24 as a consequence , @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests that the two components of @xmath26 are unbalanced with respect to @xmath11 if @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , if we set @xmath27 , then problem ( [ pde1 ] ) is written as @xmath28 note that @xmath29 has boundary layer , but @xmath10 usually does not have one . thus , @xmath30 approaches to @xmath31 as @xmath32 , which fails to describe the layer of @xmath29 .",
    "an observation of the two decoupled equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 suggests that the two measures @xmath35 and @xmath36 can portray the layer of @xmath29 and the first and second derivatives of @xmath10 . from ( [ maysp ] ) , we have @xmath37 notice that @xmath38 if @xmath6 , then @xmath39 and @xmath40 are balanced with respect to @xmath11 for the boundary condition ( [ boundary condition2 ] ) .",
    "these inspire us to think about the mixed finite element method for the problem ( [ pde1 ] ) and the two aforementioned measures .",
    "however , the mixed finite element method for the problem ( [ pde1 ] ) is a much less explored topic , since there exist some special problems such as the fourth order problem , where attempts at using the results of brezzi and babuka were not entirely successful since not all of the stability conditions were satisfied , cf . @xcite and the reference therein . to overcome this difficulty , falk et al . developed abstract results",
    "from which optimal error estimates for these ( biharmonic equation ) and other problems could be derived ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not easy to extend the results of @xcite to the problem ( [ pde1 ] ) , because of the existence of an extra term and the singular perturbation parameter @xmath11 .",
    "recently , for a fourth order reaction diffusion equation , the error estimates of its mixed finite element method was derived in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite about the _ a posteriori _ estimation of ciarlet - raviart methods for the biharmonic equation .    in this work ,",
    "our goal is to develop robust residual - type _ a posteriori estimators for a _ mixed finite element method for the problem ( [ pde1 ] ) in the two aforementioned measures .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the boundary condition ( [ boundary condition2 ] ) does not include any information on the immediate variable @xmath29 . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we develop a novel technique to analyze residual - based _ a posteriori _ error estimator .",
    "the key idea is to replace a function @xmath41 ( such that @xmath42 ) without boundary restriction by a function @xmath43 with boundary restriction , which catches at least  @xmath44 times \" of @xmath45 in the @xmath11-weighted energy norm ( see lemma 3.3 below ) . combining this novel design with standard tools , we develop uniformly robust residual - type _ a posteriori _ estimators with respect to the singularly perturbed parameter @xmath11 in the two aforementioned measures .",
    "we refer to the reference @xcite on balanced norm for mixed formulation for singularly perturbed reaction - diffusion problems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce mixed weak formulations and some notations , and prove an equivalent relation between the primal weak solution and the weak solution determined by its mixed formulation .",
    "some preliminary results are provided in section 3 .",
    "residual - type _ a posteriori _ estimators are developed and proven to be reliable in section 4 .",
    "an efficient lower bound is proved in section 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "numerical tests are provided to support our theory .",
    "setting @xmath27 , and employing the boundary condition ( [ boundar condition1 ] ) , we attain the ciarlet - raviart mixed problem @xmath46 : @xmath47 similarly , using the boundary condition ( [ boundary condition2 ] ) , we arrive at the ciarlet - raviart mixed formulation @xmath48 : @xmath49    for any bounded open subset @xmath50 of @xmath0 with lipschitz boundary @xmath44 , let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the standard lebesgue and sobolev spaces equipped with standard norms @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "in fact , by regularity theory for elliptic problems @xcite , if @xmath0 is convex and @xmath66 , then @xmath67 and @xmath68 . thus ( [ discrete mixed formulation p1 ] ) has solution , which is unique since its homogeneous system has only one solution satisfying @xmath69 .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn for the system ( [ discrete mixed formulation p2 ] ) .",
