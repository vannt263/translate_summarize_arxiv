    "the relationship between unconventional superconductivity and magnetism in heavy - fermion systems and transition metal oxides is one of the most interesting research areas in condensed matter physics . in both cases",
    "it is widely believed that the magnetic degrees of freedom play an essential role in the formation of superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , unconventional superconductivity yields strong feedback on the magnetic spin excitations in these systems below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "one example is the famous so - called resonance peak observed in high-@xmath4 cuprates by means of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite whose nature is still actively debated.@xcite remarkably , it has been found that ins reveals the formation of a new magnetic mode in the superconducting state of the uranium based heavy - fermion compound upd@xmath0al@xmath1 with @xmath4 = 1.8 k.@xcite its sharply peaked intensity , its temperature dependence and the energy position well below 2@xmath2 ( with @xmath2 being the maximum of the superconducting gap ) strongly resembles the resonance peak seen in high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "this is particularly remarkable , since the origin of superconductivity in cuprates and upd@xmath0al@xmath1 seems to be different .",
    "while frequently discussed scenarios in cuprates are a spin - fluctuation mediated cooper pairing or the electron - phonon interaction , in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 a magnetic - exciton mediated pairing model has been proposed@xcite based on available experiments .",
    "the latter model is built on the dual nature of the 5@xmath5 electrons .",
    "it consists of localized 5@xmath6 crystalline electric field ( cef ) states which disperse into a magnetic exciton band due to intersite interactions and a conduction electron band @xcite formed by itinerant @xmath7 electrons with enhanced hybridization .",
    "the model successfully explains the formation of unconventional superconductivity in this compound@xcite based on the virtual exchange of the magnetic excitons between itinerant quasiparticles .",
    "it is important to note that the resonant spin excitations in superconducting cuprates can be seen as a direct consequence of the @xmath8-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "namely , the resonance peak occurs only if the order parameter changes sign in the first brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite thus , ins can be considered as a bulk probe for the unconventional nature of superconductivity in these compounds .",
    "therefore it is important to search for such an effect in other unconventional superconductors as well . in this paper",
    "we analyze the consequences of the unconventional pairing on the magnetic excitations in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "we show that in addition to the magnetic exciton dispersion present in the normal state , unconventional superconductivity induces the formation of a bound state below @xmath4 with an associated resonance peak in the magnetic spectrum at the antiferromagnetic ( af ) wave vector * q*=@xmath3 where @xmath9 is a lattice constant along the crystallographic @xmath10 axis .",
    "its frequency is well below 2@xmath2 and in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "we show that similar to cuprates the resonance peak in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 is a consequence of an unconventional superconducting order parameter which changes sign at regions of the fermi surface connected by the antiferromagnetic wave vector * q*. we analyze the influence of antiferromagnetism on the formation of the resonance peak and surprisingly find that its intensity is enhanced due to the reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "we find that the dispersion of the resonance peak away from * q * is controlled by the momentum dependence of excitations of the localized magnetic moment ( magnetic exciton ) .",
    "the resonance peak in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 has also been studied by bernhoeft _ _",
    "e__t al.@xcite within a phenomenological two component spin susceptibility model",
    ". however , in our microscopic calculations we show that antiferromagnetic order plays a crucial role in the formation of the resonance peak below @xmath4 .",
    "following previous consideration by mchale _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite we use the low - energy hamiltonian describing the interaction of the itinerant @xmath5 electrons and magnetic excitons originating from localized 5@xmath6 crystalline electric field ( cef ) states : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mev is the energy gap of the 5@xmath6 electrons between the ground and first excited states in the crystalline electric field .",
    "the dispersion of the magnetic excitons is approximately described by @xmath14 $ ] with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the coupling constant between the itinerant electrons and the localized magnetic moments .",
    "we adopt parameter values @xmath17 = 5.5 mev and @xmath18 .",
    "note , here we follow ref . in assuming that only the @xmath19 component of the conduction electrons can excite magnetic excitons .",
    "therefore the spin - space isotropy is broken in a maximal ( ising ) way . as a result",
    "the usual classification of cooper pairs into spin - triplet and spin - singlet states is not valid and the notation _ _ e__qual and opposite spin pairing states should be better used instead .",
    "however , we will still speak of singlet and triplet cooper - pairing states as commonly done .",
    "( [ eq : hamilt ] ) gives rise to fermionic and bosonic self - energies and is particularly relevant for electron - hole states separated by the antiferromagnetic wave vector * q*=(0,0,@xmath20 ) .",
    "previously it has been shown that this interaction explains superconductivity in upd@xmath0al@xmath1.@xcite we define the electron and magnetic exciton green s functions as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is essentially the pseudospin susceptibility .",
    "the bare magnetic exciton green s function is given by @xmath24 .",
    "due to the interaction of the magnetic excitons with conducting electrons , the feedback effect on the former results in @xmath25 where the magnetic exciton self - energy is given by @xmath26 here , the spin susceptibility of the conduction electrons in the superconducting state is        the fermi surface of the conducting electrons is almost like a cylinder with weak dispersion along the @xmath10 direction . neglecting the anisotropy of dispersion in the plane yields @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 . here",
    ", we approximate the hexagonal unit cell by a circle with radius @xmath36 chosen so that the hexagon and the circle have the same area . furthermore , we assume a parabolic dispersion in the plane .",
    "due to the ising - type anisotropy of the interaction between conduction electrons and magnetic excitons it has been previously found@xcite that both pure paramagnetic , _",
    ", spin - singlet states @xmath37 with @xmath38 momentum dependence and spin - triplet states ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 with @xmath41 have the highest ( degenerate ) superconducting transition temperature .",
    "thus , in the following we will consider the two superconducting order parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the most relevant ones in this model .",
    "let us now discuss the consequences of the behavior of im@xmath44 for the magnetic exciton dispersion which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exciton ] ) .",
    "the dispersion of the magnetic exciton in the presence of coupling to the conduction electrons is given by @xmath45    in the normal paramagnetic state , re@xmath44 is a constant at low frequencies determined in our case by the curvature of the fermi surface along the @xmath46 direction . at the same time",
    "im@xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a landau damping constant .",
    "thus , the bare magnetic exciton acquires a linewidth and renormalizes slightly by a certain constant which changes the original position of @xmath49 downwards . in the superconducting state",
    "the renormalization is strongly dependent on the gap symmetry .",
    "for example , in the conventional @xmath50-wave state re@xmath44 is less than its normal state value .",
    "first , the @xmath50-wave superconducting gap gives a negative contribution to @xmath51 as follows from the coherence factor in eq .",
    "( [ sust0 ] ) , and second it yields the spin excitation gap structure in im@xmath44 as follows from the @xmath52 function .",
    "therefore , the feedback of the conduction electrons on the magnetic exciton becomes weaker and yields a shift of the magnetic exciton dispersion towards higher frequencies in the superconducting state with respect to its normal state value .    at the same time , the unconventional character of the superconducting gap entails immediate consequences for eqs .",
    "( [ sust0 ] ) and ( [ eq : pole ] ) .",
    "namely , at the fermi surface ( i.e. , for @xmath53 ) one finds @xmath54 as well as @xmath55 where * q * is the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "thus , in both cases the anomalous coherence factor equals @xmath56 for all @xmath46 momenta which is in strong contrast to the usual @xmath50-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath52 function in eq .",
    "( [ sust0 ] ) starts to contribute for @xmath57 ^ 2   + ( |\\delta_{k_z}|+|\\delta _ { k_z+q_z}|)^2}$ ] which is determined by the value of the gap , @xmath58 and the quasiparticle dispersion along @xmath46 axis , @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the singlet and triplet superconducting gap , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the singlet case there is no gap in im@xmath44 and therefore , it is nearly the same as in the normal state@xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "then re@xmath44 is a constant at low frequencies . therefore the magnetic exciton dispersion will be simply shifted in proportion to the total value of re@xmath44 exactly as in the normal state .",
    "correspondingly , no strong feedback on the magnetic exciton due to superconductivity takes place .",
    ". then due to a combined effect of the anomalous coherence factor and the @xmath52 function , a discontinuous jump in im@xmath44 occurs at about @xmath64 for the triplet order parameter . via kramers - kronig transformation",
    "the discontinuous jump in im@xmath44 yields a logarithmic singularity in re@xmath44 .",
    "note , the logarithmic singularity in fig .",
    "1.(b ) is suppressed by a weak damping .",
    "furthermore , below @xmath65 the re@xmath44 is increased with respect to its normal state value for @xmath66 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "a frequency dependence of the re@xmath67 can yield more than one solution of eq .",
    "( 7 ) . in order to demonstrate",
    "how those solutions can be found above and below t@xmath68 we illustrate in fig .",
    "2 the possible characteristic behavior of @xmath69 .    here",
    ", we assume that in normal state the re@xmath44 is almost frequency independent and magnetic exciton s peak position shifts slightly in superconducting state with respect to its normal state value . due to the gap structure in superconducting state , depending on the value of @xmath16 , a new pole may occur at energies less than @xmath70 . if im@xmath44 is small or zero at these frequencies , the total im@xmath71 , i.e. , the spectral function of magnetic excitations , shows a resonance peak which occurs only in the superconducting state .",
    "this agrees well with experimental ins data@xcite .",
    "moreover , at higher energies one finds in addition two more poles in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole ] ) .",
    "the latter yields an additional structure in im@xmath71 which is a renormalized magnetic exciton with finite damping .",
    "this typical behavior of the susceptibility can be found in fig .",
    "so far we have ignored the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 for the conduction electrons.@xcite antiferromagnetic order results in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 due to the interaction of neighboring uranium ions .",
    "this leads to a dispersion for exciton state and eventually to an antiferromagnetic instability and a new ground state.@xcite the unit cell is doubled and the brillouine zone is correspondingly reduced . the new dispersion of the conducting electrons enters the expression for the spin susceptibility .",
    "then the solutions of eq .",
    "( 7 ) must be redetermined .",
    "this is done in the following .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the value of the effective antiferromagnetic staggered field .",
    "this term leads to a splitting of the quasiparticle energy dispersion into two bands.@xcite in particular , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : totalh ] ) can be easily diagonalized by a unitary transformation@xcite and the resulting energy dispersions are @xmath74 with @xmath75 $ ] . here , we have introduced @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the af fermi surface of the two bands @xmath78 consists of two disjoint cylinders in the reduced af bz @xmath79 ( see ref . ) . in a pure af state , the real part of the susceptibility @xmath51 at low energies",
    "is determined by the intraband processes and can be approximated by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the af coherence factor . at wave vector * q * for @xmath82 the susceptibility is proportional to the density of states and decreases rapidly to zero as one increases frequency .",
    "this is a consequence of the equality @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the renormalization of the magnetic excitons due to conduction electrons can be safely ignored .",
    "most importantly , in the superconducting state coexisting with af , the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility of the conduction electrons including intraband and interband scattering is given for @xmath84=0 k , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 by      here the first and the third terms describe the intraband quasiparticle pair creation while the second term refers to the corresponding interband process .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : susaf ] ) contains two types of coherence factors , _ i_.e .",
    ", due to superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order , respectively . as usual ,",
    "the low - energy behavior of im@xmath44 is dominated by the intraband contributions .",
    "we also assume that the presence of antiferromagnetism does not change the qualitative behavior of the superconducting gap , _ i_.e .",
    ", the position of the line node and the corresponding change of sign of the superconducting order parameter remain the same although some higher harmonics may appear.@xcite as in eq .",
    "( [ sust0 ] ) , the superconducting coherence factors equal 2 for @xmath46 momenta close to the fermi surface . at the same time , the reconstructed conduction bands in the af state have only one - half the original period , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "therefore all parts of the fermi surface can be connected by the antiferromagnetic wave vector * q * and simultaneously have a sign change @xmath89 of the gap except at the nodal points . as a result",
    ", im@xmath90 is non - zero for @xmath91 due to the contribution of the nodal states both in the singlet and the triplet cooper - pairing cases . with increasing frequency im@xmath44 increases up to energies of about @xmath70 and then decreases",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "the functional dependence of im@xmath44 at low frequencies resembles the behavior of the density of states except that the structure occurs at around @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly , the real part of @xmath92 is the same as in a pure af state .",
    "however , away from @xmath82 it does not drop as in the pure af state but increases quadratically up to about 2@xmath2 due to the structure of im@xmath44 induced by the superconducting gap . only then does re@xmath44 drop to small values . altogether re@xmath93 increases in the superconducting state for @xmath94 due to the unconventional nature of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "however , the pure resonance ( bound state ) in im@xmath71 is not realized due to finite damping .",
    "an additional pole in im@xmath71 still exists at frequencies smaller than 2@xmath2 due to a strong increase of re@xmath44 at small frequencies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . at higher frequencies",
    "it becomes small and thus another pole appears corresponding to the broadened original magnetic exciton .",
    "thus , im@xmath71 has a two - pole structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . note , in order to increase the intensity of the low - energy pole in im@xmath71 we include the contribution of the higher harmonics to the gap function .",
    "as already mentioned , they are due to the presence of af order @xcite .    finally we discuss the dispersion of the magnetic excitations away from * q * along the @xmath95 direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the calculated momentum and frequency dependencies of im@xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that as soon as @xmath97 the    original magnetic exciton has a strong upward dispersion in the normal state .",
    "therefore , effects connected with renormalization induced by superconductivity will also be shifted towards higher energies . the pole induced by superconductivity shows dispersion similar to the magnetic exciton",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] . for",
    "both singlet and triplet order parameters our results are in fair agreement with recent ins data.@xcite namely , in the superconducting state one finds two distinct energy dispersions , one being the resonancelike feature with high intensity inside the superconducing gap and the second , that of localized magnetic excitons renormalized by the conducting electrons .",
    "another interesting point worth noting is that due to the doubling of the unit cell and the equality @xmath98 , the effect of the @xmath99 and @xmath38 gaps leads to a very similar behavior for im@xmath44 .",
    "the slight difference in the absolute magnitude arises from the different densities of states at those regions of the fermi surface where the maximum of the singlet and the triplet gaps occur .",
    "altogether this does not change the functional form of im@xmath44 .",
    "we mention that thermal conductivity results in a rotating field @xcite are compatible with both @xmath38 and @xmath99 order parameters while the observed knight shift @xcite seems to favor the former .",
    "interestingly , we also found that a recently proposed superconducting gap with @xmath100 symmetry @xcite does not lead to the formation of low - energy spin excitations around wave vector * q * in the superconducting gap .",
    "the reason is that its momentum dependence yields no change of the sign of the superconducting order parameter , @xmath101 , and thus no constructive contribution can result from the anomalous coherence factor .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the effects of superconductivity on the magnetic excitations in the unconventional superconductor upd@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , due to the change in sign of the superconducting order parameter the conduction electron susceptibility is enhanced in the superconducting state which yields an additional pole ( bound state ) in the total susceptibility .",
    "we further analyzed the role played by antiferromagnetism and found that its presence increases the spectral weight of the resonance due to the doubling of the unit cell .",
    "however , the resonance peak in the af phase becomes a virtual bound state due to finite damping .",
    "finally we point out that upd@xmath0al@xmath1 is another known example where the unconventional nature of the superconducting order parameter yields a structure in the magnetic susceptibility as in layered high-@xmath4 cuprates",
    ". therefore it can be regarded as a model system of unconventional superconductivity studied by inelastic neutron scattering .",
