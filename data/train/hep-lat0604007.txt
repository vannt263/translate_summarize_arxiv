    "topology in qcd plays a relevant rle in understanding several low energy properties of the theory .",
    "one of the quantities that have a direct interest in phenomenology is the topological susceptibility  @xmath1 which is defined as the correlator at zero momentum of two topological charge density operators @xmath2 .",
    "in particular the value of @xmath1 in the pure gauge theory is interpreted in terms of the mass of the singlet pseudoscalar meson  @xcite .",
    "the lattice is an excellent tool to calculate such dimensionful observables and specifically the lattice determination of @xmath1 in the pure gauge theory is in good agreement with phenomenological expectations  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 or any other topology  related quantity on the lattice requires a regularization @xmath3 of the topological charge density operator .",
    "the formal nave continuum limit must satisfy @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "however in general @xmath3 does not meet the continuum ward identities  @xcite .",
    "consequently the lattice definition of the topological susceptibility @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the lattice volume and @xmath8 ) need not coincide with the physical continuum expression @xmath1 .",
    "the two quantities are related by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath0 and @xmath10 are renormalization constants which for evident reasons are called multiplicative and additive respectively . in order to extract @xmath1 from the lattice data of @xmath11",
    "one must know the values of @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us outline the origin of the two renormalization constants .",
    "any matrix element which contains @xmath12 insertions of the topological charge operator can be calculated either in the continuum ( with an adequate regularization ) or on the lattice . in general the two calculations match only after the inclusion of a multiplicative renormalization constant @xmath0  @xcite for each insertion of @xmath2 . in a formal writing , @xmath13 where @xmath0 is a finite renormalization constant . in the theory with fermions the topological charge mixes with other operators related to the axial anomaly  @xcite .",
    "this mixing induces a correction to the above described multiplicative renormalization and consequently also to eq.([chil ] ) .",
    "such a correction is however rather small  @xcite and it is usually neglected consistently with the large statistical errors from a typical numerical simulation .    if @xmath14 the above matrix element includes further divergences which are the origin of the additive term @xmath10 .",
    "in fact the expression for @xmath1 contains the product of two topological charges at the same spacetime point .",
    "the operator expansion of this product at short distances contains mixings with operators that share the quantum numbers of @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand it is known that the correlation function of two topological charge operators at nonzero distance is negative  @xcite , @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "this inequality also holds on the lattice for any definition of @xmath3  @xcite . since @xmath1 is a positive quantity , part of the contact terms",
    "must be included in the physical definition of @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the terms , if any , must be subtracted and they are @xmath10 .",
    "a prescription is necessary to calculate @xmath10 . due to the expression @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the partition function of the gauge theory with a theta term , we know that @xmath1 vanishes within the zero topological charge sector .",
    "we then adopt the following definition for @xmath10 : it is the value of @xmath11 in the sector of zero topological charge , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the value of the total topological charge of a configuration ( as determined by cooling or other means , see later ) .",
    "a nonperturbative method to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath10 has been developed in refs .",
    "the method will be described in section  2 .",
    "it has been used in several calculations of topological properties in qcd and other theories .",
    "various tests and studies of efficiency have also been worked out in the past . in section  3 we will present the main contribution of the paper : a study of systematic errors that may affect the calculation of the renormalization constants and a comparison of results when they are obtained by using different methods for calibrating the background topological sector .",
    "some conclusive comments are given in section  4 .",
    "in refs .  @xcite a technique , called `` heating method '' , to calculate the renormalization constants in eq.([chil ] ) was put forward .",
    "the idea behind the heating method is that the uv fluctuations in @xmath3 , which are the ultimate cause for renormalizations , are effectively decoupled from the background topological signal so that , starting from a classical configuration of fixed topological content , it is possible , by applying a few updating ( heating ) steps at the corresponding value of the lattice bare coupling constant @xmath21 , to thermalize the uv fluctuations without altering the background topological content .",
    "this result is favoured by the fact that topological modes have very large autocorrelation times , as compared to other non  topological observables ( this autocorrelation time is particularly long in the case of full qcd  @xcite and also in the case of a large number of colours  @xcite )",
    ".    one can thus create samples of configurations within a given topological sector @xmath20 with the uv fluctuations thermalized . if @xmath22 then the measurement of @xmath23 on such a sample leads to the lattice value of the background topological charge @xmath24 .",
    "as described above  @xcite , this result must be renormalized to match the continuum value @xmath20 , @xmath25 where the subscript @xmath26 indicates that the thermalization is achieved within the sector of charge @xmath20 . therefore ,",
    "knowing @xmath20 from the classical configuration and determining @xmath24 from the measurement of @xmath23 on the sample , @xmath0 can be extracted .",
    "if @xmath27 then measuring @xmath28 on the sample leads to the value @xmath29 which is precisely @xmath10 , as indicated above .",
    "@xmath10 can also be calculated on samples with nonvanishing topological background @xmath20 .",
    "following eq.([chil ] ) and eq.([qlzq ] ) the additive constant is extracted in this case by using the relation @xmath30 and leads to the same results  @xcite .",
    "a sample of configurations belonging to the sector of total topological charge @xmath20 is obtained in the following way .",
    "one starts from a classical configuration with topological charge @xmath20 .",
    "it can be easily obtained either by using cooled configurations where the energy and the topological charge correspond to the presence of one instanton ( if @xmath31 ) . ] or by setting all gauge links to unity ( if @xmath27 ) .",
    "then a few updating steps are applied and the proper operator ( either @xmath23 or @xmath28 ) is measured at each step . moreover at each step the background topological charge is checked by cooling  @xcite in order to verify that the configuration still lies in the sector of charge @xmath20  @xcite . when the result of the measurement stabilizes ( data display a plateau ) , while @xmath20 stays fixed , we consider that the uv fluctuations are thermalized and @xmath32 and @xmath33 yield @xmath0 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "when the cooling applied to a configuration reveals that its background topological charge is no longer equal to @xmath20 then the configuration is discarded from the sample .",
    "however it might also happen the following event : a possible new instanton or anti ",
    "instanton created by the various updating steps might evade the cooling probe because the very cooling procedure could destroy it ( this may happen especially when the instanton spans a few lattice spacings ) . in this case",
    "we would include in the sample a configuration which actually does not belong to the sector of topological charge @xmath20 .",
    "such an event would obviously distort the measurement of any of the above topological operators .",
    "for example , it yields an overestimation of @xmath34 because any added instanton or anti  instanton only increments the value of the square .",
    "on the other hand since the theory predilects the sector of vanishing topological charge , the updating steps during the calculation of @xmath0 tend to bring the configuration to that sector either by destroying the original instanton or by creating from scratch an anti  instanton . as a consequence",
    "the value of @xmath32 becomes underestimated because on average the expectation value of @xmath23 in the sector @xmath27 is less than in the sector with @xmath31 .    in the past",
    "we have always been aware of that potential problem and in this paper we present a study where the background topological sector is calibrated by another method in order to compare the results and detect any difference in the form of a systematic error .",
    "the new method is the counting of zero modes by using ginsparg ",
    "wilson based operators  @xcite and it will be described in the next section .",
    "following the lines described in the above section , we have calculated the values of the renormalization constants in eq.([chil ] ) for the 1smeared topological charge operator defined as  @xcite @xmath35 where all link matrices have been substituted by 1smeared links  @xcite ( the smearing parameter was @xmath36 ) .",
    "the corresponding renormalization constants will be called @xmath37 and @xmath38 to denote the level of smearing . in the above expression @xmath39",
    "is the plaquette in the @xmath40 plane with the four corners at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( counter  clockwise path ) .",
    "links pointing to negative directions mean @xmath45 .",
    "the generalized completely antisymmetric tensor is defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the calculation was performed for the yang ",
    "mills theory with su(3 ) gauge group and wilson action  @xcite .",
    "the lattice size was @xmath48 and the bare coupling @xmath49 .",
    "the practical procedure was the following : starting from a classical configuration with the adequate topological background content ( @xmath27 for @xmath37 or @xmath31 for @xmath38 ) , 80 heat  bath ( hb ) steps were applied , each step consisting of three cabibbo ",
    "marinari  @xcite hits , one for each su(2 ) subgroup and kennedy  pendleton algorithm  @xcite for refreshing the dynamical variables .",
    "the operator ( @xmath50 for @xmath37 or @xmath23 for @xmath38 ) was measured every 4 steps .",
    "this set of 20 measurements is called `` trajectory '' .",
    "a test of the topological sector was accomplished after each measurement on a separate copy of the configuration .",
    "we accepted only those measurements that were thermalized within the corresponding topological sector .",
    "this condition means that the data must have stabilized to a plateau and that the test must have revealed that the configuration lay within the correct topological sector .",
    "the average over all accepted measurements yielded @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the test was performed by two different methods : either by a traditional cooling  @xcite or by counting fermionic zero modes  ( cfzm ) .",
    "this last method consists in calculating the net number of zero modes , @xmath51 by enumerating the level crossings in the spectrum of the wilson ",
    "dirac operator @xmath52 as the fermion mass @xmath53 is varied  @xcite .",
    "this method was utilized in refs .",
    "@xcite to calculate the topological charge .",
    "the main advantage of the cfzm method against cooling is that the first one does not need to modify the configuration to which it is applied , hence the topological content is never altered during the test . on the contrary",
    "its main disadvantage is that its implementation is heavily time  consuming .",
    "let us discuss in more detail the cfzm method .",
    "we can stop counting crossings at any mass @xmath54 inside the allowed interval @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in general the measurement of the topological charge will depend on @xmath56 because there can be level crossings all along the interval of masses where the gap is closed .",
    "this makes the zero mode counting method to look ambiguous .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that such a dependence is rather mild for @xmath57 as long as @xmath58 . in the present work we have sought crossings up to three different values for the stopping mass : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular the last ( and largest possible ) value looks particularly interesting because instantons representing crossings close to @xmath62 span a size of a few lattice spacings  @xcite , i.e. : they are the instantons that most likely could evade the cooling test .",
    "the search for crossings was realized by following the same procedure of ref .",
    "an accelerated conjugate gradient algorithm  @xcite was employed to extract the lowest eigenvalues of the wilson ",
    "dirac operator .    the topological charge after the cooling test was required to be equal to 1 or 0 within a tolerance of @xmath63 .",
    "we usually chose @xmath64 although tests with other values were performed ( see later ) proving that the results are very robust against variability of @xmath63 .    -2",
    "cm      the results for @xmath37 are shown in fig .  [ mtotal ] .",
    "we have calculated 1380 trajectories of 80 hb steps and measured the operator @xmath28 every 4 steps after checking that the background charge was zero . for each measurement , in the figure we show the average over all the results .",
    "actually we show the data after the 16@xmath65 step because measurements after too few hb steps are irrelevant as the configuration is surely not yet thermalized .",
    "a plateau seems to set in after approximately 40 steps which indicates that thermalization has been achieved .",
    "then the value of @xmath37 can be extracted by averaging over the data after the 40@xmath65 step .",
    "the error bar was calculated in the following manner : each trajectory was treated as a single data by averaging all accepted ( i.e. : all thermalized and correctly calibrated ) points in it . since",
    "separate trajectories are prepared by independent monte carlo runs , this procedure guarantees the absence of autocorrelations . then the average and the error are easily obtained from this set of 1380 data .",
    "furthermore , due to the fact that different trajectories can contain a variable number of accepted points , each trajectory must be weighted by a factor proportional to the number of accepted points in it .    -2",
    "cm    if the number of accepted points in the trajectory @xmath66 is @xmath67 and if @xmath68 is the average over all accepted measurements @xmath53 in this trajectory , @xmath69 then @xmath70    fig .",

    "the four white symbols on the left side of the figure are the corresponding results for @xmath37 .",
    "they become smaller as the value of @xmath56 is incremented .",
    "this effect is possibly an indication of a systematic error which however has little effect in the calculation since all results look compatible with each other within errors .",
    "it must be stressed that the statistical errors , represented by the error bars in the figure , amount to about 3% which is rather small .    in fig .",
    "[ mq0 ] we show , for each measurement , the number of trajectories for which the calibration test gave an acceptable result , @xmath27 .",
    "the plot is shown for all measurements , thermalized or not , from the 20@xmath65 hb step onward .",
    "the maximum possible number is obviously 1380 and it falls off as the amount of hb steps is increased .",
    "the decrease is steeper for the cfzm with larger stopping mass . in the latest step and for the cfzm with @xmath71 about",
    "30% of all trajectories have varied the topological sector , while for the cooling method the analogous percentage is about 17% . such a difference still allows to obtain results for @xmath37 that are compatible within ( small ) errors , as shown by the white symbols in fig .",

    "[ mcoolq0 ] three tolerance parameters for cooling are compared indicating that the three tests are almost completely equivalent . again the maximum possible number of trajectories with the right background topological charge is 1380 and it diminishes as the amount of hb steps is increased .",

    "the difference between the value of the charge and the closest corresponding integer ( @xmath82 in our case ) becomes negligible when the inequalities @xmath83 hold ( @xmath84 being the instanton size and @xmath85 the lattice size ) .",

    "the systematic error is negligible down to @xmath95 .",
    "possibly if the statistics were increased this limit could grow . in any case to calculate @xmath0 it is better to make use of instantons with @xmath20 as close as possible to an integer .",
    "we have studied two possible sources of systematic errors in the nonperturbative determination of the renormalization constants for the evaluation of the topological susceptibility on the lattice , @xmath0 and @xmath10 ( see eq.([chil ] ) ) :    * _ i ) _ the cooling test of the background topological charge along the heating process could yield a wrong information since the cooling procedure could delete the unwanted instanton or anti ",

    "an independent check of the cooling test has been performed by applying calibration methods based on the counting of fermionic zero modes .",
