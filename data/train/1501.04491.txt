    "now that the observations of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have reached levels of sensitivity and angular resolution that have allowed the determination of the main cosmological parameters with accuracies close to @xmath8 @xcite , attention has shifted to the study of the polarization of these anisotropies .",
    "cmb polarization also encodes a wealth of cosmological information . in particular , it is of paramount importance to study the b - mode anisotropy , which can only be created by vector or tensor perturbations , such as those due to primordial gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "as all inflationary scenarios are predicted to give rise to gravitational waves , this b - mode signal is a definite test for inflation .",
    "following previous upper limits placed by experiments like quiet @xcite or bicep @xcite , the first detection of this signal was claimed in data from the bicep2 experiment at 150  ghz , with a level of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , soon after these results were published , some papers @xcite appeared pointing out that the bicep2 team could have underestimated the contribution from polarized thermal dust emission , leading to a wrong interpretation of their signal .",
    "this has been recently supported by data from the _ planck _ satellite , which have shown that the level of polarized dust emission in the region of the sky covered by bicep2 could form a significant component of the measured signal @xcite , thus causing a likely reduction in the level of cosmological signal that can be inferred from the bicep2 results .",
    "it is therefore clear that , any unambiguous b - mode detection requires a full assessment of the level of foreground contamination and ideally confirmation by independent experiments operating at different frequencies .",
    "quijote is one of these experiments , which operates in the frequency range 10 - 40  ghz , and is subject to different systematics and foregrounds .",
    "quijote data will also be useful for measuring the polarization of low - frequency foregrounds , which are known to dominate the underlying primordial b - mode polarization over a wide frequency range , and therefore need to be characterized and removed from the observed maps .",
    "synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons is the most important contaminant at low frequencies in polarization . in intensity , free - free emission and the so - called anomalous microwave emission ( ame )",
    "also show up in this frequency range .",
    "while the former is known to be practically unpolarized @xcite , very little is known about the polarization level of the ame . since its discovery in the 90s @xcite , many observations in large - sky areas @xcite and in individual galactic @xcite and extragalactic @xcite clouds",
    "have contributed to the understanding of the physical properties of this emission .",
    "a great deal of effort has also been dedicated to theoretical modelling of ame .",
    "electric dipole radiation from very small and rapidly rotating dust grains in the interstellar medium @xcite , the so - called _ spinning dust emission _ , is the scenario that best fits the observations .",
    "an alternative mechanism based on magnetic dipole emission has also been proposed @xcite , with a spectrum peaking at higher frequencies .",
    "the characterization of ame polarization properties is important not only to get further insight into its physical mechanism , but to assess how it could affect experiments pursuing the primordial b - mode signal in the frequency range 10 to 50 ghz .",
    "there are some theoretical studies of the ame polarization in the literature .",
    "after the first predictions by @xcite of spinning dust polarization , more recently @xcite presented a model based on observations of the uv polarization bump , according to which the maximum polarization fraction would be @xmath10 , at a frequency of 5  ghz . in regard to the magnetic dipole emission model , while @xcite predicted high polarization fractions ( up to 40  % ) in the case of dust grains with atomic magnetic moments oriented in a single domain , @xcite recently presented a more realistic model , with randomly - oriented magnetic inclusions , which results in lower polarization degrees ( @xmath11% in the range @xmath12  ghz ) .",
    "however , not much is known , from the observational standpoint , about the polarization properties of the ame . using _ wmap _",
    "5-year data @xcite set an upper limit @xmath13 ( this and other upper limits that will be referred to in this section are at the 95% confidence level ) on the polarization fraction of the diffuse ame .",
    "some other constraints refer to individual clouds . @xcite observed the perseus molecular complex with the cosmosomas experiment and derived @xmath14 at 11  ghz .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit of @xmath15 at 31  ghz on the @xmath16 ophiuchi molecular cloud using the _ cosmic background imager _ , whereas @xcite found a maximum of @xmath17 with the green bank telescope at 9  ghz .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained an upper limit of @xmath15 at 23  ghz on the perseus molecular complex using _ wmap _ 7-year data .",
    "shortly after this paper @xcite , using the same data , obtained @xmath18 in the same region , and @xmath19 in @xmath16 ophiuchi .",
    "a detailed review of all these observations , plus some updated constraints in some regions , have been presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results obtained with the quijote experiment , that are based on observations of g159.6 - 18.5 in the perseus molecular complex , one of the most studied ame regions in the sky @xcite .",
    "quijote observations cover the frequency range @xmath12  ghz , where only the cosmosomas experiment had provided observations of the ame before .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold : to confirm the downturn of the ame spectrum at frequencies below 23  ghz through similar spectral sampling but completely independent results to those provided by cosmosomas , and to set constraints on the polarization level of the ame in the so far unexplored spectral region between 12 and 20  ghz .",
    "section  2 is dedicated to the description of the observations and the basics of the data reduction .",
    "our main results are presented in section  3 , while the conclusions of this work are discussed in section  4 .",
    "the new data presented in this article were acquired with the quijote experiment .",
    "quijote is a collaborative project that consists of two telescopes and three polarimeter instruments covering respectively the frequencies 10 - 20 , 30 and 40  ghz , and located at the teide observatory ( 2400  m a.s.l . ) in tenerife ( spain ) .",
    "the main science driver of this experiment is to perform observations of the cmb polarization to constrain the b - mode signal down to @xmath20 , and to characterize the polarization of low - frequency foregrounds , mainly synchrotron emission and the ame , so that this signal can be removed from the primordial maps to a level that will permit reaching the previous level of @xmath21 .",
    "the two quijote telescopes are based on an offset crossed - dragone design , with projected apertures of @xmath22  m and @xmath23  m for the primary and secondary mirrors , and provide highly symmetric beams ( ellipticity @xmath24 ) with very low sidelobes ( @xmath25  db ) and polarization leakage ( @xmath26  db ) .",
    "the first instrument to be fielded on the quijote first telescope is a multi - frequency instrument ( mfi ) with 4 horns covering the frequency range @xmath12  ghz , and with angular resolutions close to one degree .",
    "these detectors are fitted with mmic low - noise amplifiers ( noise temperature better than 10  k ) , and use stepped polar modulators to measure the polarization of the incoming radiation , providing instantaneous sensitivities of @xmath27k@xmath28 in four individual frequencies with nominal figures : 11 , 13 , 17 and 19  ghz .",
    "the median integrated pwv above the observatory is @xmath29  mm , giving a zenith atmosphere temperature of @xmath30  k at 11  ghz and @xmath31  k at 19  ghz .",
    "the mfi saw first light on november 2012 and since then it is performing routine observations of different galactic and cosmological regions .",
    "the second instrument consists of 31 polarimeters at 30  ghz ( tgi , thirty - gigahertz instrument ) , and is based on the same design of the mfi except that the polarization modulation is achieved electronically through phase switches .",
    "this instrument will be commissioned during 2015 .",
    "finally , the third instrument is planned to have 31 polarimeters at 40  ghz ( fgi , forty - gigahertz instrument ) . using the tgi and the fgi , which will provide instantaneous sensitivities of @xmath32k  s@xmath33",
    ", we plan to survey an area of @xmath34  deg@xmath2 down to a projected sensitivity of @xmath35k / beam .",
    "a more detailed description of the technical and scientific aspects of this project can be found in @xcite or in rebolo et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the observations covering the perseus molecular complex were carried out between december 2012 and april 2013 using the mfi , in four frequency bands centred at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39  ghz .",
    "the beam fwhms are @xmath40 , for the two lower frequencies , and @xmath41 , for the two high frequency bands .",
    "the observations consisted of raster scans at constant elevation in order to minimize the effect of atmospheric variations .",
    "each scan had an amplitude in azimuth direction of 12 degrees centred around the coordinates ra = 3@xmath4252@xmath43 , dec .",
    "= 34@xmath44 .",
    "this position was chosen to be equidistant between the ame cloud g159.6 - 18.5 and the california hii region ( ngc1499 ) , which is also observed in the scans and is used as a null test for zero polarization . in each raster scan , of total integration time of 30 - 35 minutes",
    ", the telescope moves back and forth in azimuth at a velocity of 1  deg / s .",
    "a total of 336 raster scans were performed , in four positions of the polar modulators ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) in order to minimize systematics . in total 194.4  hours of data",
    "were accumulated , 23% of which were removed due to being affected by bad weather or instrumental effects , resulting in a final effective observing time of 148.9  hours . as the mfi horns are separated typically by 5  degrees on the sky , the sky coverage of each one is different . the total sky area covered by the four horns was respectively 176 , 184 , 277 and 261  deg@xmath2 .",
    "we determine the gain calibration factors ( giving the conversion from voltage measured in the detectors to temperature on the sky ) using intensity measurements on cas a , which is ideal as it is bright and has a very low degree of polarization .",
    "we do daily 25-min raster scans of @xmath49 degrees around this source from which we derive the gain calibration factors for each channel .",
    "the output signal of each channel is a combination of the three stokes parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . according to _ wmap _ the polarized intensity of cas a at 22.8  ghz is @xmath53  jy ( polarization fraction @xmath54 ) @xcite , which is low enough not to be detected in a single raster scan .",
    "we can therefore safely assume @xmath55 , and use the @xmath50 flux to calibrate . to achieve this we use the modelled spectrum of @xcite , which is obtained by fitting a combination of _ wmap _ 7-year data and other ancillary data to a logarithmic quadratic function .",
    "this function is then integrated over the measured spectral transmission of each frequency band to obtain the reference cas a fluxes associated with each channel .",
    "finally , as the previous model is referred to epoch 2000 , in order to account for the secular decrease of the cas a flux ( typically 0.5%/year ) , we use the @xcite model , which was derived using vsa observations , in order to refer the final fluxes to the time of the observations . in order to circumvent possible uncertainties associated with this secular variation",
    ", a more suitable calibration source would be jupiter .",
    "however , owing to its small angular size , this source is severely diluted in the quijote beams and a large number of observations would be required for it to be used as primary calibrator .",
    "we point out that , in any case , the gain calibration will only affect the modelling of the sed in g159.6 - 18.5 .",
    "the gain calibration factors will cancel out when dividing the polarized intensity by the total intensity , and therefore the inferred polarization fractions , which are one of the main goals of this paper , are insensitive to the absolute flux calibration .",
    "one of the main steps of the data processing is the calibration of the polarization angle @xmath56 , which is defined as the reference position angle of each polar modulator . to accomplish this we use tau a (",
    "also known as the crab nebula ) as a calibrator , which is the brightest polarized source in the sky in the microwave range .",
    "we perform daily 25-min raster scans of @xmath49 degrees around this source , from which we derive a polarized flux that is a function of the intrinsic @xmath57 and @xmath58 , of the position of the modulator relative to @xmath56 and of the parallactic angle @xmath59 .",
    "_ wmap _ 7-year results @xcite show that the @xmath57 and @xmath58 ratios for tau a do not significantly vary ( less than 2% , which is consistent with the error of the measurement ) between 23 and 94 ghz .",
    "we therefore assume that these factors will remain equally unchanged down to 10  ghz , and use as reference the _ wmap _ measurements at 22.8  ghz , the closest frequency .",
    "as we also know @xmath59 , we can therefore fit for @xmath56 .    using 191 raster scans on tau",
    "a throughout a year we have checked that the recovered polarization angle , @xmath56 , is stable over time .",
    "we then combine all these observations to derive a unique value for each horn .",
    "the accuracy on the determination of this angle is respectively @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the two horns that will be used in the polarization analyses that will be presented in this paper . in quiet ,",
    "an experiment which has similarities with quijote , a precision of @xmath62 is achieved by using a combination of tau a observations with a sparse - wire - grid calibrator @xcite .",
    "we point out however that the accurate determination of this angle is important only to derive precise @xmath51 and @xmath52 fluxes .",
    "an incorrect angle will result in a mixing of flux between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but the polarized intensity @xmath63 will remain unchanged . as in this analysis",
    "we will get constraints on the polarization fraction , the accurate calibration of the polarization angle is unimportant .",
    "the four output channels of each frequency band contain a combination of three stokes parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the sum of these channels , after calibration of their individual gains , give @xmath50 , while the subtraction of pairs of channels gives the following combination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the position angle of the polar modulator , whose reference position is calibrated following the procedure explained in section  [ sec : polcal ] , and @xmath59 is the parallactic angle . out of the four channels , two are correlated and therefore are affected by the same @xmath66 noise , while the two other are not .",
    "to reconstruct the polarization signal we then only use the two correlated channels , in order to minimize the @xmath66 contribution .",
    "the typical knee frequencies of our receivers are @xmath67  hz depending on the channel .",
    "however , for the measurement of polarization , the subtraction results in much lower values of @xmath68  hz . in order to further reduce the @xmath66 noise in the final maps , we apply a filter on the time - ordered - data ( tod ) by subtracting the median of the data in intervals of 20  s , after binning the data at 50  ms .    under the assumption that the filtered tods are dominated by white noise , we consider the noise covariance matrix to be diagonal , a hypothesis that considerably simplifies the map - making .",
    "as the response of our instrument to polarization is a combination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in order to recover these stokes parameters in each pixel we have to combine all the samples lying in that pixel corresponding to different angles @xmath69 . to do so we use two independent strategies .",
    "the first one consists on producing 100 maps , each one corresponding to @xmath70 angles within a given bin , and then using the 100 values of each pixel to find the best - fit solution for @xmath51 and @xmath52 from equation  [ eq : v_sub ] .",
    "the second strategy builds on an analytical @xmath71 minimization .",
    "the different parameters , which are combinations of sines and cosines of the @xmath70 angles , are grouped in each pixel , and at the end of the process the @xmath51 and @xmath52 values are computed using the analytical formulas that result from this minimization . in both cases the data samples",
    "are weighted according to their noise , which is calculated from the standard deviation calculated during the binning of the tods .",
    "to produce the final maps we use a healpix pixelization @xcite with @xmath72 ( pixel size @xmath73  arcmin ) , which is sufficient given the beam fwhm . while we have checked that the maps resulting from the two strategies are almost identical , in the subsequent analyses we use those resulting from the second method .",
    "all the polarization data that will be used in this article comes from the quijote experiment . however , in order to obtain the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of g159.6 - 18.5 , from which the residual ame fluxes will be inferred , we use ancillary data from other experiments . in the low - frequency range",
    "we use the @xcite map at 0.408  ghz , the @xcite map at 0.820  ghz and the @xcite map at 1.4  ghz .    at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77  ghz , similar frequencies to quijote , we use data from the cosmosomas experiment @xcite . in order to minimize the @xmath66 noise ,",
    "the data from this experiment was filtered by the suppression of the first seven harmonics in the fft of the circular scans , which results in a flux loss on large angular scales . for this reason ,",
    "the comparison with other experiments that preserve all the angular scales is not straightforward .",
    "it is necessary to account for the flux lost , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the fluxes presented in that paper are already corrected , so we directly take those fluxes .",
    "we also use data from the 9-year release of the _ wmap _ satellite @xcite to provide flux estimates at frequencies 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94  ghz .",
    "recent data from the first release of the _ planck _ mission @xcite cover the frequencies 28 , 44 , 70 , 100 , 143 , 217 , 353 , 545 and 857  ghz .",
    "we also download the released type 1 co maps @xcite , which are used to correct the 100 , 217 and 353  ghz frequency maps from the contamination introduced by the co rotational transition lines ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) , respectively .",
    "finally , in the far - infrared spectral range we use zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) cobe - dirbe maps @xcite at 240  @xmath78 m ( 1249  ghz ) , 140  @xmath78 m ( 2141  ghz ) and 100  @xmath78 m ( 2998  ghz ) .",
    "intensity and polarization fluxes will be calculated by applying an aperture photometry integration on the maps .",
    "this is a well known and widely used technique in this context @xcite , consisting of integrating temperatures of all pixels within a given aperture , and subtracting a background level calculated in an external ring . instead of the mean ,",
    "following @xcite , we chose to use the median of all the pixels in the external ring as the estimate of the background level .",
    "the median is a better proxy for the real level in cases of strongly variable backgrounds with many outlier pixels .",
    "the flux is then given by @xmath79~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the number of pixels in the aperture , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent respectively the pixel thermodynamic temperatures in the aperture and in the background annulus . the median is calculated over the @xmath83 pixels in this annulus . the function @xmath84 gives the conversion factor from temperature to flux , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the planck and boltzmann constants , @xmath88 the speed of light , @xmath89  k @xcite the cmb temperature and @xmath90 the solid angle subtended by each pixel .",
    "the determination of the error associated with the previous estimate is crucial for the results of this paper . in a hypothetical case of perfect white uncorrelated",
    "noise , it could easily be estimated through : @xmath91^{1/2}~~ , \\label{eq : err1_flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 represents the error of each pixel .",
    "however , in quijote the instrument noise is correlated due to the presence of @xmath66 residuals , and also the galactic background fluctuations introduce , mainly in intensity , an important contribution to the error which is correlated on the order of the beam size .",
    "ideally we should then use the covariance matrices of the instrument and background noises .",
    "the former can be extracted through a characterization of the @xmath66 noise spectrum , however the latter is difficult to determine . instead , in the previous equation we can introduce in the denominator the number of independent pixels in the aperture and in the ring , which we will denote respectively as @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the pixel variance will be calculated from the pixel - to - pixel standard deviation of all the pixel temperatures @xmath82 in the background , @xmath95 . obviously , the standard deviation of the pixels in the aperture would be biased by the presence of the source . on the contrary ,",
    "the standard deviation of the pixels in the ring gives a reasonable estimate of the contributions of the background and of the instrumental noise to the true error .",
    "therefore , the final equation that we will use to estimate errors in this paper reads as : @xmath96    in the case of the error being completely dominated by the background , then we could use for @xmath93 and @xmath94 the number of beams in the aperture and in the background , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "however , while being particularly strong in intensity , the background fluctuations from the galactic emission are not so important in polarization .",
    "for this reason , in this case the relative contribution from the @xmath66 residuals to the uncertainty is significant . to quantify this , we selected 20 random positions around our source , g159.6 - 18.5 , and performed flux integration on those positions using the same aperture and ring sizes .",
    "the standard deviation of those fluxes gives a reasonable estimation of the true noise of our flux estimate . from this analysis we determined that for intensity @xmath99 , while for polarization @xmath100 .",
    "this is what we will use in our estimation of the flux errors .    in cases of low signal - to - noise fluxes , or when placing upper limits on the polarized flux @xmath101 , as it will be our case",
    ", it is necessary to de - bias the fluxes derived from the aperture photometry integration .",
    "this requirement comes from the fact that the posterior distribution of the polarized intensity @xmath101 does not follow a normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",
    "furthermore @xmath101 is a quantity that must always be positive , and this introduces a bias into any estimate .",
    "for any true @xmath102 we would expect to measure on average a polarization @xmath103 . in order to get the de - biased fluxes , @xmath104 , from the measured ones , @xmath101 , we choose the bayesian approach described in @xcite and in @xcite , consisting of integrating the analytical posterior probability density function over the parameter space of the true polarization .",
    "the same posterior can not be used for the polarization fraction , @xmath105 , as it follows a different distribution . as , to our knowledge",
    ", there is not in the literature any analytical solution for the posterior distribution of @xmath106 , we numerically evaluate this function by applying monte - carlo simulations .",

    "this confirms previous results on this region obtained with the cosmosomas experiment @xcite . when combining the quijote measurements with data coming from cosmosomas , _",
    "wmap_-9yr and _ planck_-dr1 , we get an intensity sed with 13 points between 10 and 50  ghz being dominated by ame , providing what probably is the most precise spectrum of this emission ever measured in an individual object .",
    "this intensity sed is well fitted ( @xmath292 ) by a combination of free - free , cmb , spinning dust and thermal dust , and two spinning dust components associated to a high - density molecular phase and to a low - density atomic phase .",
    "we attempt to fit some of the parameters describing the physical environment of the cloud , and which define the shape of the spinning dust spectrum , but the solution is clearly degenerate and this approach does not achieve a better fit .",
    "however , with the physical parameters we use for the spinning dust spectra , we get reliable values for the 7 parameters of our model .    the california hii region is well detected in intensity , presenting a spectrum at quijote frequencies consistent with free - free emission .",
    "the polarization maps at the position of california are consistent with noise , as it is expected for regions dominated by free - free emission , which is very lowly polarized .",
    "no polarization is detected at the position of g159.6 - 18.5 either , so then we extract upper limits on the polarized intensity and on its degree of polarization . after combining the low - frequency and high - frequency maps of two horns of quijote",
    ", we get @xmath414 and @xmath415 ( @xmath7 c.l . ) , respectively at @xmath401 and @xmath416  ghz , being the first upper limits on the ame polarization fraction in this frequency range .",
    "these constraints are consistent with models of the spinning dust emission , that predict polarization fractions between @xmath377 and @xmath417 in this frequency range , and rule out several models based on magnetic dipole emission . pushing these constraints",
    "even further is crucial to test the theoretical models and also to assess up to what level ame will hinder the detection of the b - mode signal by current and future experiments operating in the frequency range 10 to 80  ghz .",
    "new quijote observations in this region will improve the sensitivity in our maps so that we will be able to improve the previous constraints at least by a factor 2 , allowing to reach a sensitivity on the polarization fraction close to the predictions of the spinning dust models .",
