    "the heisenberg model of nearest - neighbor coupled spins is of high interest in theoretical as well as in experimental physics .",
    "the simplest variant is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of coupled spin-1/2 particles , described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 in terms of pauli matrices @xmath5 at lattice site @xmath6 . using jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite",
    "it can be mapped to a system of spinless fermions whose hamiltonian has a kinetic ( hopping ) term and a density - density interaction term between fermions at neighboring sites .",
    "it therefore represents one of the simplest systems of strongly interacting fermions .",
    "the model ( [ eq : h ] ) is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz  @xcite . despite its solvability ,",
    "time dependent properties , like a time - dependent current autocorrelation function that is via a linear response theory directly related to the transport coefficient , are at present beyond capabilities of exact methods .",
    "isotropic one - dimensional heisenberg model ( [ eq : h ] ) is experimentally realized in so - called spin - chain materials  @xcite , for instance in many cuprates . as of yet unexplained in these materials is a very high thermal conductivity along the axis of heisenberg chains  @xcite , believed to be due to contribution from heisenberg chains and strongly influenced by impurities .    in the present work we shall study magnetization transport in the isotropic heisenberg chain ; for",
    "an overview of references on a more general anisotropic heisenberg model see introductions in refs .",
    "isotropic heisenberg model has been studied in the past , however , no definite conclusion about magnetization transport has been reached so far .",
    "most studies focused on the drude weight , whose non - zero value indicates a non - diffusive transport , usually just called ballistic . using the bethe ansatz a non - zero drude weight at all temperatures",
    "is advocated in  @xcite , with @xmath7 behavior at high temperatures , while zero drude weight at all temperatures is predicted in  @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalizations  @xcite , as well as conformal field theory  @xcite and quantum monte carlo  @xcite , also result in a finite drude weight at high temperatures , see also  @xcite .",
    "using current autocorrelation function obtained by exact diagonalization is non - conclusive  @xcite because long time scales exist .",
    "extrapolation to the thermodynamical limit is very difficult with these results because exact diagonalization is limited to small systems , while quantum monte carlo , bethe ansatz and conformal approaches have their own problems  @xcite .",
    "low - energy bosonization calculation , together with the analysis of current autocorrelation function from density matrix renormalization group method , on the other hand indicates  @xcite a presence of diffusive contribution , also seen in quantum monte carlo calculation  @xcite .",
    "all these results , some showing zero drude weight , others non - zero , or even the presence of a diffusive component , call for a more precise characterization of transport .",
    "quantification just in terms of zero or non - zero drude weight namely fails to distinguish between different variants of non - diffusive behavior .",
    "a more detailed classification can be done for instance by studying how the current @xmath6 scales with system length @xmath1 if one fixes the difference of potentials at boundaries .",
    "two extreme examples are the scaling @xmath8 if a system obeys fourier law , and @xmath9 in case of ballistic transport . however ,",
    "as is well known from studies of classical transport  @xcite , in many systems the scaling exponent is a real number , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "transport is called anomalous if the scaling exponent differs from @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 is via the fourier - like law that relates a transported quantity @xmath15 and its current @xmath6 , @xmath16 , directly related to the diffusion constant @xmath17 , resulting in the scaling @xmath18 . under certain assumptions",
    "a heuristic argument with classical non - interacting particles leads to a connection between @xmath14 and the exponent @xmath19 of the spreading of disturbances as quantified by the variance @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the relation is @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the regime of @xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath24 , is called super - diffusion , while that of @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26 , is called sub - diffusion .",
    "note that sub - ballistic transport with @xmath27 means that the drude weight is zero .",
    "recently , numerical simulations have shown  @xcite that @xmath28 in the isotropic heisenberg model at an infinite temperature in the linear response regime . in the present work we shall extend on these results by calculating diffusion constant also at finite temperatures , showing that the scaling stays the same at high temperatures ( higher than the exchange interaction ) .",
    "we shall also provide some other properties of isotropic heisenberg model , like the relaxation rate to a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "in order to be able to study nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) we couple the system to reservoirs at left and right chain ends .",
    "the two reservoirs are kept at different potentials inducing a nonzero magnetization current through the chain .",
    "we describe reservoirs in an effective way using the lindblad equation  @xcite for the density matrix @xmath29 of the system , @xmath30 + { \\cal l}^{\\rm dis}(\\rho)={\\cal l}(\\rho ) , \\label{eq : lin}\\ ] ] where the dissipative linear operator @xmath31 describing bath is expressed in terms of lindblad operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 + [ l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } ] \\right)$ ] .",
    "we use two kinds of reservoirs . to obtain ness at infinite temperature , i.e. , zero energy density",
    ", we use the so - called one - spin bath which is realized by two lindblad operators at each end , @xmath34 at the left end and @xmath35 at the right end , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being pauli matrices .    to simulate ness at a finite temperature we use the so - called two - spin bath , in which one has 16 lindblad operators acting at two boundary spins at each end .",
    "the form of these 16 operators is complicated and we do not state it explicitly .",
    "they are obtained by demanding that the stationary equation on two boundary spins , described by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , has for a solution a grandcanonical state @xmath38 .",
    "targeted grandcanonical state @xmath38 is obtained by calculating it from a small chain of @xmath40 spins , @xmath41 ( tracing is performed over @xmath42 spins in a chain of length @xmath40 ) , where @xmath43 is a total magnetization and @xmath44 and @xmath45 the imposed temperature and potential at the left / right end of the chain .",
    "details of the implementation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath38 is used only to generate appropriate lindblad operators that will simulate finite temperature .",
    "once a ness is found for a large chain ( of upto 256 spins ) a real system s temperature will be determined by calculating expectation values of observables in the ness .",
    "our results do not depend on details of lindblad operators used in the simulation ( therefore also not on details of @xmath38 used in deriving them ) , their only goal is to impose a finite energy density in the ness .",
    "the driving parameter @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) will always be small as we are interested in the linear response regime .",
    "for stationary properties under maximally strong one - spin driving see  @xcite .    for both kinds of reservoirs the ness , simply denoted by @xmath29 in the rest of the paper ,",
    "is found by evolving an arbitrary initial state @xmath47 with the lindblad equation for sufficiently long time , until a nonequilibrium stationary state @xmath48 is reached . to calculate time evolution of @xmath49 we use a time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg )",

    "@xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec:33 ] we will be interested also in spectral properties of the liouville superoperator @xmath50 ( [ eq : lin ] ) .",
    "because a detail knowledge of the eigenvalues of @xmath50 can not be obtained by a simple implementation of tdmrg we use , we have instead used an exact diagonalization on somewhat smaller systems .",
    "in all our simulations , using one - spin or two - spin baths , we use a weak driving @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "symmetric driving with respect to left / right end imposes a ness state with the average magnetization being zero . in a two - spin bath ,",
    "with which we can simulate finite temperature states , the imposed temperature is the same at the left and the right end , @xmath53 .",
    "a consequence of this is that the energy density in the ness , @xmath54 is independent of the position index @xmath6 and the energy current in the ness is therefore zero .",
    "@xmath55 denotes the expectation value in the ness , @xmath56 . because driving is weak the ness is locally close to equilibrium .",
    "we can therefore determine  @xcite the temperature of ness , called a `` measured '' temperature @xmath57 , by equating the expectation value of the energy density to the one expected in a canonical state , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and solving for @xmath57 .",
    "the ness can be approximated by a canonical state because the average potential @xmath60 is zero .",
    "we have checked that the ness state is indeed close to the canonical one by verifying that expectation values of nearest - neighbor observables in the bulk of the ness agree with the canonical ones within @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , for the ness with @xmath62 we have one - point expectation values @xmath63 ( they are non - zero due to tdmrg truncation error ) , @xmath64 , two - point expectation values @xmath65 , @xmath66 , while other two - point nearest - neighbor expectation values are smaller than @xmath67 . in the thermal canonical state all one - point expectation values are zero , while two - point nearest neighbor agree with the ones in the ness .",
    "three - point expectation values in the ness are all smaller than @xmath67 , except @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( as well as that of all permutations of the three pauli matrices occurring in these two operators ) which are of order @xmath70 . in the canonical state",
    "all three - point nearest - neighbor expectation values are zero .",
    "some four - point nearest neighbor expectation values in the ness are non - zero and of size @xmath71 , for instance of operators like @xmath72 , @xmath73 or @xmath74 ( and permutations of these four operators ) .",

    "because the operator entanglement of the ness @xmath29 also increases , simulations get increasingly more difficult .",
