    "( 1977 ) and tomisaka et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , the shock speed of such a bubble can be estimated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of supernovae normalized by 20 , @xmath25 is the energy of each supernova normalized by @xmath26 erg , @xmath27 is the density of the ism normalized by @xmath28 @xmath1 , and @xmath29 is the age of the supershell normalized by @xmath30 myr . in order to study the evolution of the shock compressed wnm by such a bubble , we add a colliding flow velocity field of @xmath31 km s@xmath12 @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we initially set @xmath34 g magnetic field in the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane , which is the typical field strength in the diffuse ism ( e.g. , beck 2001 ) .",
    "the interrelation of magnetic field and cnm morphology formed behind a shock is a key issue in this study .",
    "so we examine various cases of the angle @xmath3 between the initial magnetic field and propagation direction of shock wave ( or @xmath35-axis ) , i.e. , cases with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath36 and @xmath39 directions . in the boundary planes at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we set continuous flows of the wnm by imposing @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is any mhd variable .    in the case of the bubble with the age 10 myr and expansion velocity given by eq.([eqsb ] ) ,",
    "more than half of the volume of the ism is swept up by the shock wave in the last 3 myr .",
    "thus we stop the simulations at @xmath45 myr .",
    "the basic evolution and fate of the shock compressed wnm is essentially the same as that reported in our previous studies of 2d mhd simulations ( inoue & inutsuka 2008 ; 2009 ) : firstly , the shock compression creates a thermally unstable gas slab in which magnetic pressure balances upstream ram pressure . indeed , the average magnetic field strengths in the shocked slab at @xmath45 myr that are summarized in 4th row of table 1 agree with the value expected from the pressure balance @xmath46 g .",
    "then , the thermal instability develops to create cnm in cooling timescale of @xmath47 myr .",
    "because the timescale of the thermal instability that enhances gas density is governed by the cooling timescale , the thermal pressure is decreased down to the initial upstream level by the time of the cmn formation .",
    "this leads to a formation of the cnm with density @xmath48 @xmath1 . in figure [ f1 ]",
    ", we show the distributions of the fluid in the number density - pressure plane at @xmath45 myr .",
    "note that , if the initial orientation of the magnetic field is almost the same as the shock propagation direction ( @xmath49 case ) or if we neglect magnetic field , the density of formed cnm is known to become much higher ( inoue & inutsuka 2008 , 2009 ; heitsch et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in figure [ f2 ]",
    ", we show the density cross - section maps at @xmath50 plane and @xmath45 myr , in which magnetic field vectors projected onto the plane are represented as arrows .",
    "we can see that many flattened cnm clumps are formed in the shocked slab .",
    "the cmn are formed via the thermal instability that drives runaway gas condensation along the local magnetic field .",
    "this is why the cnm clumps basically have a flattened shape .      in this section ,",
    "we apply the rht developed by clark et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to the column density structures of simulations and examine the orientation correlation between filamentary cnm and magnetic field .",
    "the rht is a method that extracts linear structures from a two - dimensional scalar map and derives their orientation . in the rht , there are three arbitrary parameters denoted by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath51 is the diameter of the top hat kernel function used in the subtraction process of structures larger than the scale @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the length of the slit to detect linear structure from the data after the subtraction of the large - scale structures .",
    "@xmath53 is the coherence threshold to detect the linear structure . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath51 determines the maximum width of the linear structure extracted from the column density map , @xmath52 controls the minimum length of the extracted structure , and @xmath53 is the required degree of the coherency of the linear feature . as a result of the rht , we obtain a data cube @xmath54 that has nonzero value if the linear structure is lying at the coordinate point @xmath55 with relative angle @xmath56 to the local orientation of mass weighted average magnetic field .",
    "the exact definitions of the above parameters and a more detailed explanation of the transformation procedure are provided in clark et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .    using the rht technique , clarke et al .",
    "( 2014 ) identified linear hi structures called  fibers \" in the galfa - hi survey data with parameters typically @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "if distance to the shell of the local bubble is 100 pc , their corresponding scales are @xmath60 pc and @xmath61 pc . following these values ,",
    "we adopt @xmath62 pc , @xmath63 pc , and @xmath59 .",
    "we also apply the threshold column density of @xmath64 @xmath65 for the detection of linear features that is comparable to the sensitivity limit of the galfa - hi .    in left panels of figure [ f3 ] and figure [ f4 ]",
    ", we show the column density structures of all the runs at @xmath45 myr , where projected orientations of mass weighted average magnetic fields @xmath66 are plotted as bars .",
    "right panels of figure [ f3 ] and figure [ f4 ] show back projections of the rht @xmath67 , i.e. , grids are blacked if the rht detects linear structure there . in these figures ,",
    "the @xmath35-direction is chosen as the line - of - sight .",
    "this line - of - sight selection is reasonable , because the sun is sitting roughly in the centre of the local bubble ( sfeir et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in figure [ f3 ]",
    ", one may find that most fibers seem to be oriented along the magnetic field in the result of the run @xmath68 , and the number of fibers that orient perpendicular to the magnetic field seems to increase with @xmath3 . in the results of models with initial turbulence",
    ", although structures are much more complicated , figure [ f4 ] shows that the fibers are roughly oriented in the direction of the local magnetic field . to show these features more explicitly , in figure [ f5 ] , we plot the angular distribution function of the fibers and the mass weighted average magnetic fields ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the top panel shows the results of the models @xmath322v0-@xmath390v0 , and the bottom panel shows the results of the models @xmath322v5-@xmath390v5 .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath70 is listed in table 1 .",
    "we can confirm the above - stated features .",
    "the mass - weighted average volume density / temperature , and average surface density of the fibers are listed in table 1 .",
    "these values are very close to those reported in clarke et al .",
    "note that the rht identify the linear structures from the residual map @xmath71 that is computed by subtracting smoothed column density from original column density , i.e. , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the heaviside step function .",
    "thus , the column densities of fibers in table 1 do not include the column density of large scale structures such as foreground / background diffuse component and clouds of scale larger than @xmath51 .      why do the different angular distributions appear in models @xmath68-@xmath74 ?",
    "understanding of the difference would be directly linked to the understanding of the observed alignment of hi fibers and interstellar magnetic field . in the following ,",
    "we propose that differing characters of turbulence between models provide the reason .",
    "it is known that when gas condensation triggered by the thermal instability from a static thermally unstable medium , the cnm is formed that is flattened perpendicular to the magnetic field ( see figure 2 of inoue et al .",
    "2009 ) , because magnetic pressure prevents the gas condensation except in the direction along the local magnetic field .",
    "according to the theoretical study of shock - induced turbulence by inoue et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the interaction between the shock wave and preshock density inhomogeneity drives turbulence at the shock front and velocity dispersion becomes anisotropic biased in the direction of the shock propagation , i.e. , @xmath75 ( see also , vzquez - semadeni et al . 2007 ; inoue & inutsuka 2012 ) . in the models of @xmath322v0@xmath390v0 , the postshock velocity field is dominated by the turbulence induced by the shock - density fluctuation interaction , since there is no initial turbulent velocity in these runs .",
    "this indicates that the post shock turbulent field tends to strain post shock gas structure in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "the stretching rate can be characterized by @xmath76 .",
    "however , such a turbulent shear strain is restricted by the magnetic field , and shear motion perpendicular to the magnetic field is suppressed by magnetic tension force , leading to the modified stretching rate : @xmath77 the situation is illustrated schematically in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "( [ eqsr ] ) states that the strength of the shear strain decreases as the initial angle @xmath3 increases .",
    "this explains why angular distribution of the fibers changes with the initial magnetic field angle @xmath3 .    in the series of runs with the initial upstream turbulence ( runs @xmath322v5@xmath390v5 )",
    ", all the pdf have peaks at @xmath78 although dispersion is large .",
    "this is quite reasonable , because the initial turbulence is given as isotropic turbulence , and thus there is always strain force along magnetic field from the beginning .",
    "hennebelle ( 2013 ) showed that a similar turbulent shear strain can be the origin of non - self - gravitating filaments in the ism .",
    "our results indicate that this mechanism is operating in the formation process of hi fibers .",
    "similar discussion was made by planck collaboration xxxii ( 2016 ) that the turbulent shear flows could be the origin of the alignment between the magnetic fields and the ridges of the ism structures .",
    "they showed that the dispersion of the relative angle between the ridge structures and the local magnetic field is @xmath79 that is compatible with the results of the simulations starting from the moderate initial upstream turbulence ( see , the dispersion of the @xmath70 listed in table 1 ) .    to reinforce the above discussion ,",
    "we compute the velocity shear strength @xmath80 along the magnetic field : @xmath81 where an average is taken in the region @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a vector perpendicular to the local magnetic field . to save computation time",
    ", we restrict @xmath83 to be in the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane and its length to be 1 pc .",
    "this is reasonable because the initial magnetic field is set in @xmath35-@xmath36 plane .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows the shear strength @xmath80 as a function of @xmath3 , where diamonds correspond to the models @xmath322v0-@xmath390v0 and crosses correspond to the models @xmath322v5-@xmath390v5 .",
    "we also plot the theoretical curve eq .",
    "( [ eqsr ] ) as a solid line , where the coefficient @xmath84 km s@xmath12 pc@xmath12 prior to @xmath85 is determined by the least square fitting to the results of models @xmath322v0-@xmath390v0 .",
    "we see that the shear strengths in the models @xmath322v0-@xmath390v0 are well fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eqsr ] ) as expected , while those of the models @xmath322v5-@xmath390v5 seem to have constant floor due to the initial turbulence . from figure [ f5 ] and figure [ f7 ] , we find that the shear strength @xmath86 km s@xmath12 pc@xmath12 is the threshold value for the linear structures to be aligned to the orientation of local magnetic field .",
    "this value is quite reasonable , because the rht with @xmath87 pc detects the linear structure longer than 3 pc , and the hi clouds of size @xmath47 pc can be stretched more than 3 pc long in 3 myr ( duration of simulations ) under the shear flow with @xmath88 km s@xmath12 pc@xmath12 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the formation of the cnm in the shock - compressed layer similar to that associated with the local bubble shell , using three - dimensional mhd simulations with the effects of interstellar cooling / heating and thermal conduction .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows : a magnetized thermally unstable gas layer is created behind the shock wave in which fragments of cnm are formed via the thermal instability .",
    "this basic evolution is essentially the same as that pointed out in our previous studies using two - dimensional simulations by inoue & inutsuka ( 2008 ; 2009 ) . using the rht scheme developed by clark et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we identified linear features in the simulated column density structures .",
    "we have found that the orientation between the linear structures and local magnetic field is aligned very well when shear flows along a magnetic field ( @xmath89 ) is larger than some critical value ( @xmath90 km s@xmath12 pc@xmath12 ) in the postshock layer .",
    "when we reduced the shear strain along magnetic field by changing the initial direction of magnetic field , we observed that a number of linear structures lie perpendicular to the magnetic field increase . in the cases with realistic level of initial upstream turbulence ( @xmath915 km s@xmath12 )",
    ", we found that the cnm linear structure always tends to align with local magnetic field independent of the initial upstream orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion of the angular distribution is consistent with that measured by planck collaboration xxxii ( 2016 ) .    given the above results of simulations and synthetic observations , we conclude that hi fibers identified by clark et al .",
    "( 2014 ) would be structures embedded in the hi shell of the local bubble as those authors proposed .",
    "we also conclude that the formation mechanism of the linear hi fibers or filaments along the magnetic field would be the turbulent shear strain in agreement with the analysis by hennebelle ( 2013 ) .",
    "the relation between the orientation of magnetic fields and structures in molecular clouds has been studied by many authors ( e.g. , li et al .",
    "2014 ; malinen et al .",
    "2016 ; planck collaboration xxxv 2016 ; federrath 2016 ) .",
    "planck collaboration xxxv ( 2016 ) showed that structures in molecular clouds tend to align with local magnetic field lines for low column density structures ( @xmath92 @xmath65 ) , while high column density structures tend to be perpendicular .",
    "they discussed that the orientation shift would be caused by self - gravity , which piles up material along the magnetic field if it is relatively strong . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the filamentary structures perpendicular to the magnetic field can be created by cooling contraction even in lower density atomic ism , i.e. , a magnetic - field aligned gas accumulation is possible even without self - gravity ( see , the result of the model @xmath390v0 ) .",

    "<S> recent observations of neutral galactic interstellar medium showed that filamentary structures of hi clouds are aligned with the interstellar magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> many interesting applications are proposed based on the alignment such as measurement of magnetic field strength through the chandrasekhar - fermi method and removal of polarized foreground dust emissions for the detection of inflationary polarized emission in the cosmic microwave background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical origin of the alignment remains to be explained . to understand the alignment mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> we examine formation of hi clouds triggered by shock compression of diffuse warm neutral medium using three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the effects of optically thin cooling and heating . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shock - compressed diffuse interstellar medium of density @xmath0 @xmath1 evolves into hi clouds with typical density @xmath2 @xmath1 via thermal instability driven by cooling , which is consistent with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a machine vision transformation developed by clark et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2014 ) to the resulting column density structures obtained by the simulations in order to measure angle correlation between filamentary structures of hi clouds and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the orientation of hi filaments depends on the environmental turbulent velocity field , particularly on the strength of shear strain in the direction of the magnetic field , which is controlled by the angle between the shock propagation direction and upstream magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when the strain along the magnetic field is weak , filamentary components of hi clouds basically lie perpendicular to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the filaments have come to align with the magnetic field , if we enhance the turbulent strain along the magnetic field or if we set turbulence in the preshock medium . </S>"
