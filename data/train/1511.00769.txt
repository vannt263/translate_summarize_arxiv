    "the spontaneous lorentz violation can be driven by a dynamical vector field called bumblebee which couples with the metric @xcite or through a symmetric tensor field , called cardinal field , which gives rise to the metric tensor after a spontaneous breaking process @xcite .",
    "the effects of the spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking upon gravity have been studied in a broad range of post - newtonian tests @xcite .    an alternative approach to include local lorentz violating effects into gravity was proposed by kosteleck through a change in the structure of the spacetime for the so - called finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "in fact , the classical lagrangian and modified dispersion relations of a point particle limit of fermions governed by the sme field lagrangian can be described in terms of an extension of the riemann geometry called finsler geometry @xcite .",

    "since the geometry depends on the position and direction , the fields should also depend on the position and direction coordinates .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the properties of a real scalar field in the finslerian randers spacetime . the randers spacetime is an anisotropic spacetime whose local lorentz violation is driven by a background vector which changes the measurements of the intervals . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a dynamics for the scalar field in general finsler spacetimes described by a minimal coupling of the scalar field and the finsler metric . the coupling is intrinsically defined on the spacetime , and it yields a non - canonical kinetic term for the scalar field . in randers </S>",
    "<S> spacetime , the nonlinear dynamics can be split into a linear and nonlinear regimes , which depend perturbatively on the even and odd powers of the lorentz - violating parameter , respectively . for a timelike randers background vector , the quadratic field hamiltonian and the nonquadratic hamiltonian up to second derivatives are positive , as well as the particle hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the plane waves solutions and the modified dispersion relations . in the linear regime , </S>",
    "<S> the modified quadratic dispersion relation is free of tachyons . in the nonlinear regime , </S>",
    "<S> the quartic dispersion relation obtained up to first - order in the lorentz - violating parameter yields to ultraviolet superluminal signal which can be avoided by considering the perturbed equation of motion up to second - order . </S>"
