    "almost ten years ago [ 1 ] i proposed a hypothesis according to which quarks and gluons are confined due to the existence of light quarks ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with compton wavelengths much larger than the radius of strong interaction defined by @xmath2 .",
    "the essence of this hypothesis is the supercritical phenomenon which is well - known in qed where it is the following .",
    "if there exists a heavy nucleus of radius @xmath3 with charge @xmath4 exceeding a critical value @xmath5 ( which is of the order of 137 ) , the vacuum of the light charged fermions ( electrons ) becomes unstable due to the process of ( @xmath6 ) pair creation .",
    "the negative component of the pair , the electron , falls into the heavy charge and the positive component goes to infinity .",
    "the condition for this phenomenon to occur is that the compton wave length @xmath7 of the electron has to be much larger than the radius of the heavy charge : @xmath8 the electron which falls into the centre forms together with the source @xmath4 an ion of charge @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 , this process will continue until the vacuum becomes stable i.e.  when @xmath11 becomes less than the critical charge .    from the point of view of the dirac equation",
    "the falling electron has negative energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the supercritical ion with @xmath12 is stable because of the pauli principle .",
    "indeed , the electron can not leave the ion , since all negative energy states outside it are occupied .    in qcd",
    "this phenomenon can occur since , due to asymptotic freedom , the colour charge can reach the critical value for any object .",
    "let us suppose that two heavy quarks are created with opposite colours .",
    "the gluonic vacuum polarisation increases the colour charges of the quarks ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "when these colour charges become large enough , light antiquarks start to fall onto the heavy quark .",
    "however , the bound state formed by a light antiquark and a heavy quark will be very different from the bound states which appeared in qed . in qed we had an ion with a charge @xmath13 . in qcd",
    "the corresponding state can be colourless .",
    "the difference is due to the fact , that while the large colour charge of the heavy quark results from gluonic vacuum polarisation , the bound state is formed by two particles the total charge of which equals zero , and this charge can not be changed by vacuum polarisation .",
    "this phenomenon can be called quantum screening .",
    "formally it means that the heavy quark @xmath14 is unstable and has to decay into a meson and a light quark @xmath15 @xmath16 this case  the confinement of the heavy quark  is relatively simple and almost independent of the properties of the light quark  [ 2 ] .",
    "the problem of the light quark is more difficult . at first sight",
    "it is not clear whether the `` falling into the centre '' and the formation of a supercritical state can occur in the system of a light quark and a light antiquark .",
    "it was shown [ 3 ] , however , that indeed the critical phenomenon exists in the light @xmath17 system . moreover ,",
    "the critical coupling constant is proven to be sufficiently small : @xmath18 there is an even more complicated question : what kind of states can be formed as a result of this phenomenon ?",
    "if the appearing new state is a normal meson , the `` falling into the centre '' leads to @xmath19 instead of ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ 4 ] ) can be satisfied if there are not only positive energy quarks @xmath20 but also negative energy quarks @xmath21 .",
    "this result , although it looks very strange , is not unexpected . indeed , we already learned in qed that particles which fall into the centre correspond to the negative energy solution of the dirac equation .    to resolve the problem of the negative energy states , dirac supposed that they are all occupied and therefore not observable .",
    "the necessity to consider now both the positive and negative solutions of the dirac equation means only that dirac s hypothesis is not always true . if the interaction is strong enough , there is another possibility : negative energy states might be only partly occupied and positive energy states only partly empty .",
    "this is , however , not in contradiction with the absence of negative energy particles in the real world if stable supercritical bound states ( mesons ) exist since in this case both the positive and negative energy quarks will be unstable : @xmath22 @xmath23 and , consequently , unobservable .    from the point of view of the fermionic spectrum in the vacuum , ( [ 5 ] )",
    "means the following . in the case of weak interactions ,",
    "the fermionic spectrum has a structure corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "all levels above @xmath24 are empty , and the levels below @xmath25 are occupied",
    ". if the interaction is stronger than critical , quark - antiquark pairs are present in the vacuum , and the spectrum has a structure which roughly corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : all levels are occupied in the shaded regions and empty in the unshaded ones .    in terms of condensed matter physics , the curves @xmath26 correspond to the fermi surface .",
    "the change in the number of constituents in the theory is also natural from the point of view of the physics of condensed matter . in a theory with weak coupling we had two constituents @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; a theory with supercritical coupling contains four states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in non - relativistic physics",
    "there are only particles ( electrons ) and no antiparticles .",
    "but in a conductor we have particles and holes , and holes are negative energy states ( counting the energy of the holes from zero and not from the fermi energy as it is usually done ) .    in a relativistic theory",
    "it is impossible to add a constant to the energy of particles , and therefore we are forced to talk about negative energy states which exist only inside our matter ( vacuum ) .",
    "this unusual quark spectrum has been discussed for several years .",
    "still , i have not been able to formulate a constructive theory because i have not understood what meson had to be introduced as a supercritical bound state . from the structure of the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is clear that there have to be different types of excitations corresponding to different types of mesons . it is natural to identify hole ",
    "particle excitations of the type 1 near the fermi surface with mesons like @xmath31 , @xmath32 etc .",
    "particle excitations near the light cone can be identified with the @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons [ 4 ] and also with @xmath35 .",
    "but all these mesons do not look like natural candidates for the lowest supercritical bound states .",
    "only recently did i recognise that there are strong reasons to believe that the pseudoscalar octet , and the @xmath36-meson in particular , are in fact the lowest supercritical bound states .",
    "most of these reasons are connected with the discussion of the nature of the @xmath36-meson state which i presented in  [ 5 ] .",
    "as i have said before , the supercritical atom in qed is not a usual bohr - type atom , containing a definite number of electrons .",
    "rather , it is a collective state in which only the electron density is localised around the heavy charge , and only at large distances ( much larger than the atomic radius ) it looks like a state with a definite electron number .",
    "a quasi - goldstone state like a @xmath36-meson with a finite mass has the same properties . at short distances ( distances less than @xmath2 )",
    "it can be considered as a collective state of the type @xmath37 ( divergence of the pseudovector current ; @xmath15 and @xmath38 stand for left - handed and right - handed quarks ) , whereas at large distances it is the two - particle state @xmath39 . accepting this identification with the @xmath36-meson as the lowest supercritical state by introducing it explicitly in the equation for the quark green function ( which will be discussed in the next part of the lecture )",
    ", it proves possible to find a solution for this green function which has properties corresponding to the spectrum in fig .",
    "this solution has two complex poles as functions of energy in the complex energy plane in accordance with the two types of quarks ( constituent and current ) we have discussed .",
    "it has no pole on the real axis which guarantees that quarks as propagating states do not exist .",
    "it has a soft singularity when @xmath40 , reflecting the fact that quark currents exist in the region where the hadrons are created .",
    "it is important to stress that in all these considerations i assume the coupling constant @xmath41 is saturated at a value not much larger than @xmath42 .",
    "quark masses corresponding to the positions of the two complex poles @xmath43 are of the order of @xmath44 the solution for the green s function is self - consistent if the @xmath36-meson mass is close to @xmath45 .",
    "this means that at least in the case when @xmath41 is not very large , the @xmath36-meson mass is defined by strong interaction dynamics .",
    "this result contradicts the usual point of view according to which the @xmath36-meson mass squared is the product of the bare quark mass @xmath46 defined by weak interactions and the condensate density @xmath47 defined by strong interactions .    in what follows",
    "i will explain what type of equations have to be written and solved in order to come to the conclusion i have stated and to calculate quantities which have not been analysed until now . for example , quark - gluon vertices and the gluon green s function have not been calculated yet .",
    "it is clear , however , that the gluon green s function we obtain will also have a complex singularity due to the gluon decay into a @xmath17 pair .",
    "consequently , the gluon will also be confined .",
    "equations for hadronic amplitudes can also be written constructively if @xmath41 is not very large .",
    "it can be shown that if the quark green s function has properties as described above , the hadronic amplitude will have no singularities connected with intermediate @xmath17 states , but will have singularities related to the @xmath36-meson thresholds .",
    "the fact that the @xmath36-meson is included intrinsically in the equation for the quark green s function and has a mass of the order of @xmath45 makes this statement much less mysterious than it would look without it .",
    "in the paper [ 6 ] we considered the solution for the quark green s function corresponding to the chiral symmetry breaking . we discussed the importance of including the contribution of the goldstone boson in the equation . in the present paper",
    "we show that this solution does not necessarily survive in the presence of the goldstone contribution which , essentially , reflects the softness of the condensate and leads to the existence of a solution which has no poles and which corresponds to confined quarks .",
    "we will accept the equation for the quark green s function in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is supposed to behave like in [ 6 ] ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] )    and @xmath50 is the amplitude for the pion ",
    "axial current transition , @xmath51 before turning to the formal solution , let us discuss its general properties and the difference in the structure caused by the inclusion of the pion contribution .",
    "writing @xmath52 as @xmath53 we obtain ( [ 2.1 ] ) in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "for the solution of the equation for @xmath56 without pion contribution ( i.e.  without the last term in ( [ 2.4 ] ) ) the behaviour of @xmath57 and @xmath58 as functions of @xmath59 in the euclidean region of negative @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "here the dashed curve corresponds to the massive quark , @xmath61 , and the solid curve to the massless quark , respectively . in the latter case",
    "@xmath62 if we include the last term of ( [ 2.4 ] ) , the solution corresponding to massive quarks disappears , as it was expected .",
    "the massless quark solution ( [ 2.5 ] ) will , however , survive because in this case the last term in ( [ 2.4 ] ) which can be called @xmath63 is small at large @xmath64 values : @xmath65 let us see what would be the effect of the pion contribution at small @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( [ 2.4 ] ) leads to the following two equations : @xmath68 @xmath69 we see that the pion produces a hundred percent correction to the effective coupling because @xmath70 and @xmath71 if we are close to the critical value of @xmath72",
    ". this change can be crucial .",
    "we shall analyse the equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) more carefully later . for the time being , in order to see what can happen , let us accept ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) literally .",
    "these simple equations are easy to solve .",
    "the solutions are @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are solutions @xmath76 of the bessel equation with index @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the concrete forms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 depend on the boundary conditions imposed on the solutions .",
    "if we want to preserve the behaviour of @xmath78 and @xmath79 at small @xmath64 values , we have to choose @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 the bessel functions . in this case , however , the behaviour of @xmath78 and @xmath79 will change at large @xmath64 values and it is not obvious whether it will be possible to preserve the asymptotic behaviour ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) corresponding to asymptotic freedom .",
    "if our aim is to keep the behaviour at large @xmath64 unchanged we have to choose @xmath74 and @xmath75 as superpositions of the singular and non - singular solutions of the bessel equation ,    [ 2.12 ] @xmath83    and to select @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that the asymptotic behaviour at large @xmath64 is preserved . for small @xmath64 values this means @xmath86 and , consequently , @xmath87 instead of the behaviour of @xmath78 and @xmath79 corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we now have a behaviour as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "this behaviour corresponds to the confined solution for the quark green s function . in this solution",
    "the condensate which is created at momenta of the order of @xmath88 exists only in a region of @xmath64 values between @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and disappears at smaller @xmath64 values due to its decay into @xmath36-mesons . because of the decrease of @xmath58 at large and small @xmath64 , in this solution the pion contribution to the right - hand side of the equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) , @xmath63 , is localised between @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( we shall see this in detail later ) .",
    "this localisation of the pion contribution enables us to analyse not only the behaviour in the euclidean region @xmath92 but also the analytic properties of the solution and its behaviour at positive @xmath59 values .",
    "if the pion is localised , @xmath52 satisfies the old equation without @xmath63 at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this means that @xmath52 can be written in the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 are two different solutions of the equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) for @xmath97 and @xmath98 are slowly varying functions , @xmath99 @xmath52 has to satisfy the conditions at large @xmath64 which we already imposed on our solution . for this , we are bound to choose @xmath100 to be the solution corresponding to symmetry breaking with the `` mass '' @xmath101 , which was discussed in [ 6 ] , and @xmath102 has to be the solution describing a singular behaviour of the type ( [ 2.13 ] ) , ( [ 2.14 ] ) at small @xmath64 .",
    "we have to have in mind also that @xmath52 ( [ 2.15 ] ) must not have singularities in the complex plane .",
    "@xmath100 has no singularities there but the standard cut on the real axis from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "we choose @xmath105 to have also no singularities in the complex plane .",
    "after that we shall see what will be the singularities of @xmath52 .    making use of the fact that equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) with @xmath97 is scale invariant for @xmath106 , we can always write @xmath107 where @xmath108 satisfies the equation @xmath109 this is the same equation which we have discussed in [ 6 ] ; the behaviour of @xmath110 is @xmath111 at @xmath112 and @xmath113 at @xmath114 , opposite to that shown in fig .",
    "it was shown in [ 3 ] and [ 6 ] that independently of the behaviour of @xmath72 we can always find a solution with a cut along the positive @xmath59 axis from @xmath115 to @xmath116 if we choose the solution not to have singularities at @xmath117 and if we fix @xmath108 by the condition @xmath118 ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 are in a simple relation ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath108 is chosen in such a way .",
    "then @xmath102 defined by ( [ 2.16 ] ) will have a cut from @xmath121 to @xmath122 and a singular behaviour at @xmath123 . as a result , @xmath52 has two cuts in the @xmath59 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) ,    where we take @xmath124 since , as we will see in the next section , this is the only possibility to avoid singularities in the complex plane ; due to reasons to be discussed , @xmath125 is positioned in the way shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .    for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the properties of @xmath52 in the @xmath126-plane at the value @xmath127 of the space component of @xmath27 .",
    "we will write @xmath52 , as in [ 6 ] , in the form @xmath128 for example , @xmath129 has two normal cuts ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the singularities of @xmath130 at @xmath131 and @xmath132 are different .",

    "[ fig8 ] with @xmath138 .",
    "in the course of the reflection @xmath139 the points on the line @xmath140 transform into @xmath141 ; the points @xmath142 transform into @xmath143 , respectively . as it follows from all this , @xmath144 has singularities corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "these analytic properties are a clear manifestation of the fact that the dirac see is destroyed ; @xmath144 has singularities corresponding to both positive and negative energies .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 has the meaning of the fermi energy . in order to find zeros of @xmath144 which have to be in the lower @xmath126 half plane and correspond to unstable quarks with positive and negative energy",

    "in this case the singularity appears in the lower half plane and describes the unstable positive energy quark . repeating the calculation for @xmath160",
    ", we obtain a singularity corresponding to the unstable hole .",
    "considering @xmath161 instead of @xmath129 , we find the same singularities for an anti - quark and an anti - hole .    if the condition @xmath158 is not satisfied the singularities can move to the upper half plane .",
    "this does not destroy the theory because they will be on the unphysical sheet .",
    "however , in this case i do not have any simple interpretations for these singularities .    the analytic properties of @xmath162 presented in fig .  [ fig10 ]",
    "imply that in the limit @xmath163 the feynman green s function defined for real @xmath126 values becomes a non - analytic function .",
    "two analytic functions which have no singularities in the upper and lower complex half planes can be defined and called the retarded and the advanced green s function . at finite @xmath125",
    "there exists one analytic function with four cuts .",
    "this can be easily seen if we consider @xmath162 as a function of @xmath126 at a fixed value of the space component @xmath164 of the 4-vector @xmath165 . in this case",
    "we will have fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] instead of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "when negative energies are involved , it is natural to expect that for the exact solution all four cuts have discontinuities different from zero in the intervals from @xmath166 to @xmath167 and from @xmath168 to @xmath169 .    if in the usual , non - confined case we know the green s function ( calculating it by using feynman diagrams in the euclidean space ) , we can continue it into positive @xmath59 values and find that the discontinuity at @xmath170 satisfies the unitarity condition",
    "this means that the retarded green s function coincides with the feynman green s function .",
    "the confined case is more complicated .",
    "the knowledge of the retarded green s function in the limit ( @xmath171 ) is not sufficient for finding the feynman green s function . in order to obtain the feynman green s function",

    "let us start with the simple quasi - classical solution for @xmath0 : @xmath229 where @xmath230 is chosen so that @xmath231 , and consider the analytic continuation of ( [ 3.16 ] ) along the circle in the complex plane of @xmath232 , @xmath233 ; @xmath234 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) .    in this continuation",
    "we have @xmath235 @xmath0 will have a zero at the point @xmath236 , @xmath237 .",
    "the condition @xmath237 means that the singularity appears near the circle where @xmath238 .",
    "the condition @xmath236 gives @xmath239 hence , we will have a singularity in the _ upper _ half - plane if @xmath240 , and in the _ lower _ half - plane , on the unphysical sheet , if @xmath241 .",
    "from ( [ 3.6 ] ) it is obvious that if the pion potential is not present , then @xmath242 and there will be a singularity on the physical sheet if the solution has a minimum ( the acceleration transforms into damping ) .",
    "but with the pion potential included , @xmath243 can be less than unity , and the singularity will be on the unphysical sheet if we choose a solution with a minimum close to the minimum of the potential . at the same time , considering the behaviour of the solution for the non - confined trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) , we see the opposite situation : without the pion potential @xmath210 has no zeros and thus there is no reason for singularities . however , if in the presence of the pion potential at a small @xmath217 the solution @xmath178 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] exists and has a minimum in the region where @xmath242 , we will definitely have a singularity in the upper half plane .",
    "it is important to stress that for the non - confined trajectory the position of the minimum is defined by the form of the potential and by the condition according to which the solution has to approach zero in the limit @xmath244 .",
    "this means that at least for @xmath245 close to unity the non - confined solution will be unstable .",
    "we shall use this qualitative considerations as a hint how to obtain constructively the stable solution for the confined trajectory .",
    "let us consider the trajectory @xmath186 for which @xmath223 , defined as the point where @xmath231 , is very small , @xmath246 , and so is @xmath247 where @xmath248 . in this case the potential @xmath187 in ( [ 3.5 ] ) will be determined mainly by the pion potential .",
    "in addition , it follows from ( [ 3.4 ] ) that @xmath226 will be a slowly changing function of @xmath185 near @xmath230 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 . in this region",
    "the equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) can be written as @xmath250 where @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 with slowly varying @xmath219 and @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 .    for constant @xmath254 and @xmath219 values , ( [ 3.19 ] )",

    "indeed , in the @xmath265 limit only the singular bessel function is important , @xmath266 for large @xmath267 , as it can be seen from ( [ 3.15 ] ) , @xmath0 also has a power behaviour ( [ 3.21 ] ) ( only with different @xmath268 and @xmath269 ) .    thus we conclude that in the dangerous region where @xmath225 can be zero we have an explicit expression for @xmath270 which allows us to carry out the analytic continuation along the strip shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] and to see where the zeros of @xmath178 are .",
    "the most interesting case is when the singularity appears near the real axis in the @xmath27 plane : @xmath271 , @xmath272 the equation for the position of the singularity is @xmath273 - i_1(x')=0\\ > , \\quad   \\gamma= -\\frac{c_2}{c_1 }   = \\frac{\\dot{y_1}(x_0 ) } { \\dot{j_1}(x_0)}\\>.\\ ] ] it is clear from this equation that there is no singularity on the real axis . near the real axis , @xmath274",
    ", we have @xmath275 if @xmath267 is not small , there is no reason to expect a singularity near the real axis since in this case the potential in ( [ 3.19 ] ) is much less than unity . for small @xmath267 values",

    "it is positioned on the dangerous circle @xmath282 and near the real axis when @xmath283 is small .    performing the analytic continuation we supposed that @xmath284 is changing slowly as the function of @xmath27 .",
    "this hypothesis is correct , if the singularity is far away from the real axis ( @xmath285 ) .",
    "if , however , @xmath286 , we have to be careful : near the singularity the trajectory @xmath287 changes fast , jumping to a large value @xmath288 .",
    "fortunately , this jump does not influence essentially the behaviour of @xmath178 or the position of the singularity . at first sight",
    "this jump is important because near the singularity we have @xmath289 and in the equation for @xmath0 two terms @xmath290 and @xmath291 are of the same order .",
    "let us , however , consider the equation for @xmath292 .",

    "hence , the equation can be rewritten as @xmath296 its solution near the singularity is @xmath297 and the correction to @xmath292 from the jump in the trajectory turns out to be small if @xmath298 .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that the equations for green s functions are not sufficient to define the theory . it is easy to show that without confinement the requirement of usual analytic properties for the green s functions is enough for defining the solution for the green s functions .",
    "but even in this case it is not clear a priori , what kind of bound states have to be introduced and how these states would influence the equations for green s functions .",
    "in particular , we have to see how goldstone type states which necessarily have to exist in some cases will affect the equations",
    ". this question will be discussed later .",
    "having it in mind , we first have to learn what kind of analytic properties are necessary for the green s functions of quarks and gluons if there is confinement .",
    "let us start with the usual definition ( given by dyson ) for the green s function of the quark : @xmath299 the quantity on the right - hand side can be written in the form @xmath300 where @xmath301 @xmath302 and @xmath303 @xmath304 @xmath305 making use of charge conjugation , we can see that @xmath306 the usual hypothesis which leads to simple analytic properties for @xmath307 is @xmath308 for the energy - momentum of the intermediate states @xmath309 in ( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "if this were true the quarks would be observable .",

    "let us regard first the causality .",
    "in order to exploit it , consider the retarded green s function @xmath317 in momentum space @xmath318 can be written in terms of the same functions @xmath310 and @xmath311 @xmath319 where @xmath320 the green s function ( [ 4.9 ] ) has to be zero for @xmath321 .",

    "of course , this procedure defines a new function , different from @xmath313 , on the real axis ; it is natural to call it the feynman green s function @xmath329 .",
    "it is , i believe , possible to show that this function corresponds to the fourier component of @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the @xmath331-matrix in interaction representation ; @xmath332 , @xmath333 are free vacuum states .",
    "@xmath334 is usually calculated as a series of feynman diagrams .",

    "the discontinuities @xmath343 and @xmath344 are now complex but @xmath345 is real . the unitarity relations which under the usual ( non - confined ) circumstances define the discontinuities on the normal cuts have to define also the new discontinuities . to find them is equivalent to finding the functions @xmath310 and @xmath311 which are the imaginary parts of the dyson green s function and the retarded green s function , respectively :    @xmath346",
    "let us try to calculate @xmath347 using the hypothesis that the interaction can be introduced adiabatically in the theory .",
    "this idea is not obvious at all . in the normal perturbative case",
    "it means that starting with a free theory and introducing the interaction adiabatically , we gradually reach the vacuum state corresponding to a theory which includes interaction ( curve @xmath348 in fig .  [ fig19 ] ) .",

    "this , of course , can not be the correct answer  in the theory with confinement there exist stable hadrons in general , and those belonging to the pseudoscalar octet in particular .",
    "the problem can be resolved by introducing these pseudoscalar particles from the very beginning as elementary objects [ 6 ] . in this case",
