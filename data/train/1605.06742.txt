    "to design an intelligent and human - centered control system @xcite that adaptively adjusts relevant parameters in time to meet the human driver s needs and to provide a basic control law for the advanced vehicle dynamics control system @xcite@xcite or driver assistance system @xcite@xcite , driver behaviors , driving styles or characteristics should be recognized and predicted .",
    "for example , to improve vehicle s fuel economy and reduce the emission , we can design different control strategies for driving styles . to achieve these goals ,",
    "recognition and prediction of driving styles and characteristics precisely is the primary work .",
    "drivers and their factors have been discussed from the viewpoint of application in vehicle dynamics @xcite@xcite , physical attributes of human drivers , and modeling driver @xcite@xcite . for the recognition and prediction of driving characteristics or driver types , including physical characteristics / states ( e.g. , fatigue , drunk , and drowsiness ) , psychical characteristics ( e.g. , nervous , relaxed ) and driving styles ( e.g. , aggressive , moderate ) ,",
    "a lot of investigations have been conducted in recent years .    in general , the basic idea to identify and predict driving behaviors or styles",
    "is based on driver model , called _ indirect _ or _ model - based method_. the model - based method , firstly , requires to establish a driver model that can describe driver s basic driving behaviors , i.e. , lane keeping , lane change , and obstacle avoidance , etc .",
    "then identify or extract driving characteristics based on the proposed driver model .",
    "many stochastic process theories were applied to the recognition of driving behaviors .",
    "hidden markov model ( hmm ) , as a simple dynamic bayesian network , can identify the underlying relationship between observations and states , and then be widely utilized to model and predict driver s states @xcite , driving behaviors @xcite@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the driver - vehicle system was treated as a hybrid - state system , and the hmm was used to estimate driver s decisions when driving near intersections . in @xcite ,",
    "a probabilistic arx model was utilized to predict the human driver s behavior and classify the driving styles , i.e. , the aggressive and normal driving . to mimic and model the uncertainty of driver s behavior , a stochastic switched - arx ( ss - arx ) model was developed and adopted by akita et al .",
    "@xcite and sekizawa et al .",

    "the other recognition method to extract and identify driver s driving characteristics , called _ direct method _ .",
    "the basic process of the direct method is to directly analyze the driving data ( e.g. , vehicle speed , steering wheel angle , throttle opening , etc . )",
    "using pattern - recognition or data - analysis method without establishing relevant driver models .",
    "for recognition of driving skills , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a direct pattern - recognition approach based on three recognition methods , i.e. , multilayer perception artificial neural networks ( mlp - anns ) , decision tree , and support vector machines ( svms ) .",
    "the coefficients of discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of steering wheel angles were treated as the discriminant features . in @xcite",
    ", relationships between driver state and driver s actions were investigated using the cluster method with eight state - action variables . for different driving patterns of drivers ,",
    "the state - action clusters were different , thus segmenting driver into different patterns .    in this paper , a direct method to recognize _",
    "driving styles _ is proposed by combining @xmath0-means clustering ( @xmath0-mc ) method and svm method together . in terms of traditional recognition or classification method such as svm , anns , and arx ,",
    "most of them take a long time to calculate the reasonable results , especially for not linearly separable issues . in order to develop an efficient , time - saving , and direct method to recognize driving styles ,",
    "the @xmath0mc - svm method is adopted .",
    "there are three main steps of this research effort : 1 ) _",
    "clustering_. to extract the discrimination features that can distinctly reduce the number of support vectors , the driving data is clustered into @xmath1 subsets using the @xmath0-mc method .",
    "2 ) _ training and generating a hyperplane_. the hyperplane that can disparate driving styles into two types is generated using the @xmath0mc - svm method , to predict the new input data to which category a driver is subjected .",
    "3 ) _ experimental verification_. a cross - validation experiment is designed to recognize driving styles and to present the benefits of the proposed method .    following the overview in the first section of this paper ,",
    "section ii presents the basic framework of the @xmath0mc - svm method . to show the advantages of @xmath0mc - svm method",
    ", the experiments and driving simulator to collect driving data is shown in section iii .",
    "subsequently , the evaluation of recognition performance is discussed in section iv .",
    "in this section , the parameters selected for @xmath0mc - svm method , the svm and @xmath0-mc are discussed .",
    "the structure of proposed recognition method is shown as fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .          to characterize driving styles",
    "when drivers pass a curve road , the longitudinal speed @xmath2 and throttle opening @xmath3 are treated as the feature vector parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the longitudinal vehicle speed can reflect the driver s driving preferences .",
    "for instance , if a driver prefers high vehicle speed when passing a curve road , the driver is treated as an aggressive driver .",
    "inversely , we will treat the driver as a moderate type .",
    "therefore , the vehicle speed driver selects is treated as one of the feature parameters .      the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle can also represent the driving styles , i.e. , the higher acceleration of vehicle , the more aggressive the driver would be treated as .",
    "the throttle opening is directly controlled by the human driver and highly related to the acceleration .",
    "therefore , the throttle opening is also selected as one of the feature parameters .    to describe the driving styles",
    "precisely , the combination of longitudinal vehicle speed and throttle opening is conducted .",
    "namely , a low ( high ) speed with a large ( small ) throttle opening denotes more aggressive , and a high ( low ) speed with a large ( small ) throttle opening denotes less aggressive .",
    "therefore , the mapping between driving styles and driving data can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a set of all collected data @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "our goal is to train and learn the mapping @xmath10 that can accurately and rapidly classify new data sets .",
    "svm , as a tool of solving problems in classification , regression , and novelty detection , becomes popular in recent years and has been widely involved in voice or speaker detection @xcite , image processing @xcite , human action detection @xcite , etc .",
    "the svm method is discussed as follows .",
    "an important property of svm is that determining the model parameters is equal to solve a convex problem , guaranteeing the global optimum @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the classes of driving patterns are not linearly separable , i.e. , it belongs to the situation of overlapping class distribution .",
    "considering the case in which there are two driving - patterns in this paper that are not linearly separable in @xmath11 dimension space . for each of the @xmath12 training cases",
    ", there is a vector , denoting @xmath13 , represents the feature parameters with corresponding target value , denoting @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the training data could be written as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 . here , the aim is to generate a hyperplane in a high - dimension space to separate the two classes accurately . to separate classes as accurately as possible for the inseparable situation , the slack variable , @xmath18 , where @xmath16 , is introduced . for the new input data @xmath19 , its target value can be calculated by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a feature - space transform ,",
    "@xmath22 is a bias parameter .",
    "the slack variable , @xmath23 , allows some of the training data to be misclassified , generating a _",
    "soft margin_. then , the objective function can be described as follows :    @xmath24    where the parameter @xmath25 is used to adjust the trade - off between slack variable penalty and the margin .",
    "transform equation ( 2 ) into the lagrangian form :    @xmath26    with constraints as follows : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the lagrangian multiplier , @xmath29 is the kernel function . here",
    ", the kernel function is positive definite and gaussian kernel function is selected and presented as follows :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the gaussian kernel parameter .",
    "the determination of svm parameters ( @xmath32 ) is discussed in this section .",
    "our goal is to find the optimal parameters ( @xmath33 ) , allowing the classifier to accurately predict the unknown data . for the highly linearly - inseparable set of observations",
    ", it may not be the best for parameters that could highly separate the training data into an accuracy region , which may lead to the problem of over - fitting the training data . to overcome this issue ,",
    "the cross - validation procedure is adopted .    here ,",
    "the _ cross - validation _ and _ grid - search _ method are adopted to determine the optimal parameters ( @xmath33 ) . according to @xcite , the exponentially growing sequences of @xmath25 and @xmath34 shows a better performance of identifying the optimal parameters .",
    "therefore , parameters @xmath25 and @xmath34 are all selected by the following form :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and , here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the arithmetic sequences with initial value @xmath40 , end value @xmath41 and interval value @xmath42 . for svm training , the initial value ( @xmath43 ) is set as ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "after training the data set , we get the optimal value ( @xmath33 ) is ( @xmath45 ) , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "based on above descriptions , the driving patterns are classified using @xmath0mc - svm method and the optimal separating hyperplane is produced , as shown in fig .",

    "as one of the direct methods to analyses and extracts feature parameters from the large volume of raw data , the aim of clustering method is to provide _ objective _ and _ stable _ classifications @xcite .",
    "objective in the case means that the analysis of the same set of drivers using the same sequence of numerical methods results in the same classification .",
    "stable denotes that the classification remains the same under a wide variety of additions of drivers .",

    "@xmath51 is the set of all driving data sets and @xmath52 is the set of all labels that drivers subject to . generally speaking",
    ", the driving data would be thousands of data points ( @xmath53 ) and they are highly overlapped data sets . to reduce the number of support vectors and",
    "separate the raw feature parameters for different types driving patterns , the @xmath0-mc method is applied . for any data point ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 , the remaining data sets would be clustered and generating a new cluster , if the remaining data could meet the following condition    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is a constant parameter that determine the center - radius of new clusters , @xmath14 and @xmath58 must have the same label . therefore",
    ", the application of @xmath0-mc could refine the raw data into a new set .",
    "@xmath0-mc is used to partition the raw data sets @xmath59 into @xmath1 ( @xmath60 ) clusters , forming a set @xmath61 .",

    ". the adopted clustering algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "two typical drivers are discussed in the training results . for moderate driver @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , he prefers lower speed ( @xmath69 km / h ) with smaller throttle openings ( @xmath70 ) when passing a curve road .",
