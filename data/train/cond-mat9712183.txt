    "the sandpile model @xcite plays a special role in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics since it is the standard example of a system that reaches a critical stationary state without the necessity of fine - tuning any parameters .",
    "this property , which was named self organised criticality , has been suggested to lie at the basis of the widespread occurence of fractals and @xmath4-noise in natural systems @xcite .",
    "though the sandpile model seems to have little relevance for the description of real sand , it has the advantage that it can be threated with analytical methods .",
    "hence , it plays a role similar to that of the ising model in the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "in the ten years that have passed since its introduction the model has been intensively studied , mostly in two dimensions . besides extensive numerical work @xcite ,",
    "several theoretical developments have been made [ 48 ] .",
    "these have shown that many properties of the model are closely connected to those of spanning trees , which in turn can be described by the ( @xmath5)limit of the potts model @xcite .",
    "these connections have , for the case of two dimensions , led to exact results for the exponents that describe the distribution of sizes of waves and last waves @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relation to spanning trees has led priezzhev and his coworkers @xcite to a conjecture ( again in @xmath6 ) for the exponent governing for the sizes of avalanches , which in a way is the ` most wanted ' of the sandpile exponents .",
    "the conjectured value is in good agreement with numerical estimates . in the present paper , we present results for the sandpile model on the sierpinski gasket , a well known deterministic fractal .",
    "we have two main reasons for doing this .",
    "firstly , we want to extend the theory for waves and the conjecture for avalanches to the case of the sierpinski gasket and compare them with the results coming from extensive simulations .",
    "this can also lead to a better appreciation of the results in two dimensions .",
    "secondly , the development of effective renormalisation group approaches is a major goal in the field of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . in this respect",
    "deterministic fractals can play an important role since often real space renormalisation approaches can be worked out exactly for them .",
    "some real space approaches to sandpile models have been introduced and the results presented here can be useful in testing their validity @xcite .",
    "we also mention that we are not the first to study the sandpile model on a sierpinski gasket @xcite .",
    "a previous study was however purely numerical and was moreover restricted to an investigation of avalanches .",
    "this paper is organised as followed . in section",
    "ii we introduce the sandpile model , and give a brief overview of the existing theoretical work . in section iii",
    ", we present our numerical results for waves and avalanches on the sierpinski gasket . in section iv , our data are compared with exact results which we can obtain for wave exponents . based on our numerical results",
    ", we also give a conjecture for the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "finally we present some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "the ( abelian ) sandpile model can be defined on any graph , but for definiteness we will introduce it in the contexts of the square lattice and of the sierpinski gasket . in both cases each vertex of the lattice has four nearest neighbours .",
    "to each such vertex @xmath7 we associate a height variable @xmath8 which can take on any positive integer number .",
    "we also introduce a critical height @xmath9 of the height variable which we will take equal to four for all vertices .",
    "furthermore , it is important to stress that we work on a finite part of the lattice ( which we will denote by @xmath10 ) , which contains @xmath11 vertices . in the case of the sierpinski gasket , @xmath11",
    "is trivially related to the number of iterations @xmath12 used in constructing the fractal .",
    "the sandpile model has two time scales .",
    "on a slow time scale we drop sand at a randomly selected site and thereby increase the height variable by one unit : @xmath13 .",
    "when at a given site , @xmath14 , we say that the site becomes _ unstable _ and perform a _ toppling _ of that site which involves the following operations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 the matrix @xmath17 is the discrete laplacian . through toppling , neighbouring sites can become unstable , topple themselves , create new unstable sites , and so on .",
    "avalanche _ of topplings proceeds on the second , very fast , time scale , so that no new grains of sand are added before the avalanche is over .",
    "sand can leave the system when a boundary site topples . note that ( see figure 1 ) in the sierpinski gasket there are only three sites through which sand can flow out .",
    "an avalanche is over when all sites are stable again .",
    "we call also the resulting configuration of height variables stable .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the order in which unstable sites are toppled does nt influence the stable configuration which is obtained when the avalanche is over .",
    "this abelian nature of the sandpile model is crucial in the further analysis of its properties @xcite .    for further reference it also necessary to introduce the matrix @xmath18 which is the inverse of @xmath17 and which is therefore the lattice green function of the laplacian .",
    "it was shown by dhar that the element @xmath19 of the lattice green function gives the expected number of topplings at site @xmath20 after a grain of sand was dropped at site @xmath7 .",
    "the criticality of the model manifests itself in power law distributions which are found for many quantities .",
    "for example , let @xmath21 denote the distribution of the number of distinct sites @xmath22 toppled in an avalanche .",
    "it is found numerically that @xmath21 obeys a scaling law @xmath23 extensive simulations of the sandpile model in two dimensions lead to the estimate @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is also found numerically that avalanches are compact , i.e. the fractal dimension @xmath25 of the set of sites toppled in a avalanche is equal to that of the lattice on which the model is studied .",
    "in particular , we have for the case of the sierpinski gasket of figure 1 , @xmath26 .",
    "the number of stable configurations of the model equals @xmath27 .",
    "however , it has been shown by dhar @xcite that the number of recurrent configurations in the stationary state is exponentially smaller .",
    "in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondance between these recurrent configurations and the number @xmath28 of spanning trees on a lattice @xmath29 which consists of @xmath10 extended with an extra site , known as the sink , which represents the boundary @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath28 grows in general as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is called the _ connective constant _ of spanning trees @xcite .",
    "spanning trees are described by the @xmath32-state potts model in the limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the same model also describes resistor networks .",
    "because of the abelian nature of the sandpile model , we can perform the toppling of unstable sites in any desired order .",
    "a particularly interesting order leads to the concept of _ waves _ @xcite .",
    "suppose that an avalanche starts at a site @xmath33 and that after some topplings @xmath33 becomes unstable again .",
    "one can then keep @xmath33 fixed for the moment and continue with the toppling of other sites untill all of them ( apart from @xmath33 ) are stable .",
    "it is easy to show that in such a sequence all sites topple at most once .",
    "this set of topplings is called _ the first wave_. next , we topple the site @xmath33 for the second time . if after some topplings it becomes unstable again , we keep it fixed , and topple all the other unstable sites .",
    "this set of topplings constitutes the second wave .",
    "we continue in this way untill we finally reach a stable configuration .",
    "we can in this way decompose any avalanche in a set of waves .",
    "of course , subsequent waves in an avalanche are highly correlated , but we can also consider the statistical properties of the set of all waves , irrespective of the avalanche in which they occur . in this way , we can look at the distribution @xmath34 of the number of sites @xmath35 toppled in any wave .",
    "again , it is found that @xmath34 has a scaling form @xmath36 where we have introduced the exponent @xmath0 for waves .",
    "the properties of the last wave in a given avalanche are also of interest .",
    "the distribution of the number of sites @xmath37 toppled in this last wave leads to the introduction of still another exponent , denoted as @xmath38 . because @xmath39 , we arrive at the obvious upper bound @xmath40 it turns out that the properties of waves are easier to analyse than those of the avalanches . without going into details",
    "we summarize the following important results :    * there is a one - to - one correspondance between waves and two - rooted spanning trees ( one root corresponds with the sink , the other with the site @xmath33 ) on @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the element @xmath19 of the lattice green function is given by the ratio of the number of two rooted spanning trees ( in which @xmath7 and @xmath20 are in the same subtree ) to the number of ( one rooted ) spanning trees @xmath28 .",
    "hence , properties of waves can be determined from @xmath18 . from the known asymptotic behaviour of the lattice green function on an euclidean lattice , @xmath41",
    ", one then finds @xmath42 * the exponent @xmath38 can be obtained from the probability that @xmath43 sites get disconnected from a spanning tree when a randomly chosen bond of the tree is deleted . in particular",
    ", one finds that @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of the chemical dimension @xmath44 of spanning trees @xcite . on an euclidean lattice",
    "the precise result is @xmath45    from these results , one obtains , in @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 @xcite ) @xmath48    a final theoretical development which we need to discuss leads to a conjecture on the exponent @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "_ first relate @xmath2 to another exponent , @xmath49 . to introduce this exponent ,",
    "it is assumed that the number of sites toppled in consecutive waves ( say the @xmath50-th and @xmath51-th wave ) decreases . the change in size ,",
    "@xmath52 is assumed to occur in a self - similar way , so that @xmath53 one can then immediately show @xcite that @xmath54 finally , using the relation between waves and two - rooted spanning trees , and considering possible processes by which the size of a wave can decrease , it is found that @xmath55 and hence @xmath56 .",
    "this prediction is in excellent agreement with numerical estimates , and may very well be exact .",
    "in order to obtain numerical estimates for the exponents @xmath2 , @xmath57 , @xmath38 and @xmath49 on the sierpinski gasket we have performed extensive simulations of the sandpile model on this fractal structure . in these simulations , we have considered lattices with @xmath58 up to @xmath59 ( the latter contains @xmath60 sites ) . for each of these we have studied more then ( @xmath61 ) avalanches .    in figure 2",
    ", we show our results for the distribution of the size of the waves . as can be seen , log - periodic oscillations are superposed on the power law decay of the distribution",
    ". the behaviour of @xmath21 can therefore be described by complex critical exponents .",
    "this is a well known phenomenon in systems with _",
    "discrete _ scale invariance @xcite . the imaginary part of the critical exponent is in a sense trivial since it can be related to the discrete rescaling factor of the fractal lattice . from a careful analysis of the data",
    "one can hence obtain finite size estimates of the exponent @xmath62 as a function of @xmath12 . these can be extrapolated by making the usual assumption @xmath63 in figure 3",
    "we show this extrapolation .",
    "it leads to the estimate @xmath64 it is difficult to make a precise determination of the error in this estimate .",
    "the error we give is therefore more indicative .",
    "figure 4 shows our results for the distribution of the size of the last wave . from an examination of these data , we find @xmath65",
    "finally , our data for the distribution of avalanche sizes , shown in figure 5 , yield the exponent estimate @xmath66 in agreement with the result found by kutnjak - urbanc _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who obtained @xmath67 .",
    "we have also investigated the behaviour of @xmath68 in order to determine the exponent @xmath49 . to obtain this exponent , we have to consider only those cases in which @xmath69 ( in fact , there are many cases for which the opposite inequality holds ) . in figure 6",
    "we show our data ( after integration over bins ) . as can be seen from the figure , it is not easy to determine a clear value of @xmath49 .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath70 in the next section , we will give a lower bound for @xmath49 .",
    "our estimate ( [ 2.10 ] ) is very close to that bound .",
    "it is however difficult to imagine how @xmath49 can be negative .",
    "we therefore turned to an alternative way to determine @xmath49 .",
    "this is done by investigating how the average number @xmath71 of waves in an avalanche scales with the size of the avalanche .",
    "when the size of consecutive waves decreases , the size of the first wave is proportional to the size of the whole avalanche . from ( [ 2.4 ] ) we then obtain @xmath72 in figure 7 we show data for this quantity for @xmath73 and @xmath59 .",
    "we find _ very clear evidence for a linear relation between @xmath71 and @xmath22_. this relation breaks down only for the largest avalanches , which are those that span the lattice .",
    "but , as pointed out by kutnjac - urbanc _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , these avalanches are somewhat peculiar .",
    "they occur here because only through such avalanches is it possible for sandgrains to leave the system .    from the linear relation we find @xmath74 these data",
    "lead us to conjecture that @xmath75 exactly . as we will see in the next section",
    ", this result will be very useful in determining the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "we now present some exact results for the connective constant @xmath31 for spanning trees ( and hence for the number of recurrent states ) and for the exponents @xmath57 and @xmath38 .",
    "we make also a conjecture for @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , there exists a close connection between the theory of the sandpile model and the ( @xmath5)limit of the potts model .",
    "this connection should allow the determination of several properties of the sandpile from a study of that model on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "for example , the connective constant of the spanning trees can be obtained from the free energy of the potts model when @xmath5 .",
    "this free energy in turn can most easily be obtained by performing a simple but exact real space rg calculation for the potts model on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "consider therefore the @xmath32-state potts model for which we will denote the spin variable at vertex @xmath7 by @xmath76 . on a sierpinski gasket , these spins can also be labeled according to the ` generation ' in which they appear during the iterative construction of the fractal .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian @xmath77 of the potts model is given by @xmath78 a renormalisation group for @xmath77 on the sierpinski gasket can be obtained by performing a partial trace , denoted by @xmath79 over the spin variables which have the same ` generation label ' : @xmath80 the free energy of the model can then be obtained by a summation of @xmath81 along the renormalisation group trajectory .",
    "we have performed such a calculation . after sending @xmath5",
    "the rg flow is remarkably simple @xmath82 from which we obtain the connective constant for spanning trees after a straightforward calculation .",
    "the result is @xmath83    as mentionned in section 2 , the exponent @xmath38 can be obtained from the probability @xmath84 that upon deleting a bond at random from a spanning tree , a subtree of size @xmath43 gets disconnected . on an euclidean lattice this relation leads to the result ( [ 2.3.b ] ) . on a fractal lattice",
    ", the relation has to be modified .",
    "the correct expression now also involves the fractal dimension @xmath85 of a random walk on the fractal .",
    "this was shown in reference @xcite , where it was found that @xmath86 then , repeating the arguments in @xcite we obtain @xmath87 this is a quite general result for @xmath38 which should for all cases ( fractal and euclidean ) .    for spanning trees on the sierpinski gasket , @xmath44",
    "was recently determined by dhar and dhar in a study of loop - erased random walks @xcite .",
    "their result is @xmath88}}{\\ln 2 } \\label{2.15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ before proceeding , we would like to point out a general recipe for determining @xmath44 , using again an rg approach . for a tree ,",
    "the chemical dimension equals the red bond dimension @xmath89 .",
    "the red bonds of a connected graph are those edges which when cut , disconnect the graph .",
    "coniglio @xcite , and independently saleur and duplantier @xcite , pointed out that the red bond dimension for the critical potts model can be obtained by adding a term @xmath90 to the potts hamiltonian ( [ 2.11 ] ) .",
    "the red bond dimension can then be obtained from the linearised rg equation for @xmath91 at the critical potts fixed point .",
    "hence , it is possible to get @xmath44 for spanning trees by performing an rg calculation ( either exact or approximate ) on an extended potts model .",
    "we will present results from such an approach in a future publication . ]    inserting ( [ 2.15 ] ) in ( [ 2.3.c ] ) and using the value of @xmath85 for the sierpinski gasket ( @xmath92 , @xcite ) we get @xmath93}}{\\ln 3 } \\approx 1.712 \\label{2.16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this prediction is in good agreement with the numerical value found in section 3 .",
    "next , we turn to the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this should be determined from the behaviour of the green function .",
    "we will assume that the green function @xmath19 decays for large @xmath94 as @xmath95 the green function gives the expected number of topplings at site @xmath20 when a grain of sand has been dropped at site @xmath7 .",
    "hence it consists of all waves that cover the distance between site @xmath7 and @xmath20 .",
    "since waves are compact , we obtain @xmath96 where we have neglected finite size effects . from ( [ 2.17 ] ) we then get a general expression for the exponent @xmath0 @xmath97 to determine @xmath0 for the particular case of the sierpinski gasket , we only need to determine the value of @xmath98 .",
    "this exponent was determined in early studies on the behaviour of the resistance on fractals with the result @xcite @xmath99 this leads to the prediction @xmath100 this value is again in agreement with the one determined numerically . in principle , the exponent @xmath98 can also be obtained from the @xmath5 limit of the potts model .",
    "in fact , it can be obtained from the renormalisation group equation for @xmath101 , see ( [ 2.12.b ] ) .    finally , we turn to the exponents @xmath2 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to generalise the result ( [ 2.5 ] ) which was obtained in @xmath46",
    ". the size @xmath35 of any wave must be less then or equal to the size @xmath22 of the avalanche in which it occurs .",
    "moreover , the number of waves whose size lies between @xmath35 and @xmath102 is according to ( [ 2.4 ] ) proportional to @xmath103 . combining these two results we obtain for the size distribution of waves @xmath104 from which we immediately obtain the appropriate generalisation of ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "@xmath105 our numerical results ( [ 2.7 ] ) , ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 2.ex ] ) are nicely consistent with this picture . from the upper bound ( [ 3.priem ] ) , we obtain a bound on @xmath49 @xmath106 our first estimate of @xmath49 , given in ( [ 2.10 ] ) , is just consistent with this bound .",
    "most interestingly our conjecture that @xmath75 leads to a conjecture for @xmath2 @xmath107 which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results .",
    "we have also tried to extend the argument of priezzhev and his coworkers for the exponent @xmath49 to the fractal case . as far as we could see",
    ", such an argument always leads to a value of the exponent @xmath49 which is of order one , and which therefore is completely in disagreement with the numerical result .",
    "it therefore seems that the way in which consecutive waves are related is different for the fractal case than for the euclidean one .",
    "in this paper , we have presented extensive simulations for waves and avalanches on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "one of the most surprising results is the fact that the exponent @xmath49 is very close to zero .",
    "this implies that the way in which waves become smaller is almost independent of their size .",
    "this is most probably a direct consequence of the fractal nature of the sierpinski lattice .",
    "the result @xmath75 indicates , in our opinion , that there is good hope that the sandpile model on a sierpinski gasket may be solved exactly .",
    "we are currently using real space rg approaches which have been introduced for sandpile models @xcite , to see whether they may be worked out exactly on this lattice .",
    "+ * acknowledgement * one of us ( cv ) would like to thank d. dhar and v. priezzhev for useful discussions on the subject of this paper .",
