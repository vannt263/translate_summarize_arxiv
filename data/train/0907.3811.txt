    "wormholes are hypothetical tunnels in spacetime , possibly through which observers may freely traverse . however , it is important to emphasize that these solutions are primarily useful as `` gedanken - experiments '' and as a theoretician s probe of the foundations of general relativity ( gr ) . in classical general relativity ,",
    "wormholes are supported by exotic matter , which involves a stress - energy tensor that violates the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite .",
    "note that the nec is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is _ any _ null vector .",
    "thus , it is an important and intriguing challenge in wormhole physics to find a realistic matter source that will support these exotic spacetimes .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in the literature , amongst which we refer to solutions in higher dimensions , for instance in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory @xcite , wormholes on the brane @xcite ; solutions in brans - dicke theory @xcite ; wormhole solutions in semi - classical gravity ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) ; exact wormhole solutions using a more systematic geometric approach were found @xcite ; geometries supported by equations of state responsible for the cosmic acceleration @xcite , and solutions in conformal weyl gravity were also found @xcite , etc ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details and @xcite for a recent review ) .    in this work , instead of further exploring wormholes in some extension of gr , we rather analyse the possibility of having tunneling solutions in general relativistic solutions with negatively curved spatial surfaces which might be considered the analogue of wormholes .",
    "indeed , we consider a largely ignored metric which belongs to a class of vacuum solutions referred as degenerate solutions of class a class a @xcite by ehlers and kundt  , which are axisymmetric solutions and thus also belong to weyl s class @xcite , given by @xmath3 where the usual 2@xmath4 spheres are replaced by pseudo - spheres , @xmath5 , hence by surfaces of negative , constant curvature .",
    "these are still surfaces of revolution around an axis , and @xmath6 represents the corresponding rotation angle .",
    "the specific case of @xmath7 is of particular interest , where @xmath8 is a constant .    in our opinion",
    "this metric can be seen as an anti - schwarzschild in the same way the de sitter model with negative curvature is an anti - de sitter model .",
    "we immediately see that the static solution holds for @xmath9 and that there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath10 ( note that @xmath11 neither vanishes nor becomes @xmath12 at @xmath10)@xcite .",
    "this is the complementary domain of the exterior schwarzschild solution in the region outside the schwarzchild horizon . in the domain @xmath13 , as with the latter solution , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 metric coefficients swap signs . defining @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", we obtain @xmath18 with the following parametric definitions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which is a particular case of a bianchi iii axisymetric universe .",
    "using pseudo - spherical coordinates @xmath22 , the spatial part of the metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) can be related to the hyperboloid @xmath23 embedded in a 4-dimensional flat space .",
    "we then have @xmath24\\,{\\rm d}r^2 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & r^2 \\left ( { \\rm d}u^2+\\sinh^2u\\ , { \\rm d}v^2 \\right ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime stands for differentiation with respect to @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we can recast metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) into the following @xmath27 \\,{\\rm d}\\tau^2 +   \\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\bar r}\\right)^2\\ ,   \\cos ^4\\left[\\ln\\left ( \\bar r\\right)^{\\mp 1}\\right]\\times\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times\\ , \\left[{\\rm d}\\bar{r}^2\\,+ \\bar r^2\\,({\\rm d}u^2 + \\sinh^2{u}\\,{\\rm d}v^2 ) \\right]\\ ; , \\label{isotrop3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the analogue of the isotropic form of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "in the neighborhood of @xmath28 , i.e. , for @xmath29 , we can cast the metric of the 2-dimensional hyperbolic solid angle as @xmath30 so that it confounds itself with the tangent space to the spherically symmetric @xmath31 surfaces in neighborhood of the poles . the apparent arbitrariness of the locus @xmath28 ,",
    "is overcome simply by transforming it to another location by means of a hyperbolic rotation , as in the case of the spherically symmetries case where the poles are defined up to a spherical rotation ( so(3 ) group ) .",
    "thus , the spatial surfaces are conformally flat .",
    "however , we can not recover the usual newtonian weak - field limit for large @xmath25 , because of the change of signature that takes place at @xmath10 .",
    "analyzing the `` radial '' motion of test particles , we have the following equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants of motion defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for fixed @xmath37 .",
    "the former and latter constants represent the energy and angular momentum per unit mass , respectively .",
    "we thus define the potential @xmath38 this potential is manifestly repulsive , crosses the @xmath25-axis at @xmath10 , and for sufficiently high values of @xmath34 it has a minimum at @xmath39 .",
    "however this minimum falls outside the @xmath10 divide .",
    "so a test particle is subject to a repulsive potential forcing it to inevitably cross the event horizon at @xmath10 attracted either by some mass at the minimum or by masses at infinity . in it",
    "is hinted that the non - existence of a clear newtonian analogue is related to the existence of mass sources at @xmath12 , but no definite conclusions were drawn .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the physical properties and characteristics of this intriguing solution is presently underway @xcite , as well as an application to the cosmological features of the model , namely the study of negatively curved spacetimes in order to understand the ultimate stages of underdensities @xcite .",
    "here we shall study the extension of the solution ( [ metric_constnc - antiscwarz ] ) which arises from adding exotic matter to analyze the possibility of tunneling in hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "these would add to other non - spherically symmetric wormholes which have already been considered in the literature .",
    "for instance , extending the spherically symmetric morris - thorne wormholes @xcite and motivated by the aim of minimizing the violation of the energy conditions , polyhedral solutions and , in particular , cubic wormholes were constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the static spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solution was generalized to that of a ( non - planar ) torus - like topology @xcite , denoted as a ringhole . in ref .",
    "@xcite , solutions of plane symmetric wormholes in the presence of a negative cosmological constant by matching an interior spacetime to the exterior anti - de sitter vacuum solution were constructed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the construction of these plane symmetric wormholes does not alter the topology of the background spacetime ( i.e. , spacetime is not multiply - connected ) , so that these solutions can instead be considered domain walls .",
    "the dynamic stability analysis of plane symmetric wormholes was further analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , it is the purpose of this paper to study static and _ pseudo_-spherically symmetric counterparts to the usual wormholes by adding exotic matter to the vacuum degenerate solution of class @xmath0 , given by ( [ metric_constnc ] ) .",
    "the physical properties and characteristics of these intriguing solutions are explored , and through the mathematics of embedding it is shown that particular constraints are placed on the shape function , that differ radically from the morris - thorne wormhole .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the energy density is always negative and the radial pressure is positive , at the throat , contrary to the morris - thorne counterpart .",
    "specific solutions are also presented by considering various equations of state , and by imposing restricted choices for the shape function or the redshift function .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , the spacetime metric , the field equations and the mathematics of embedding of these pseudo - spherically symmetric geometries are analyzed in detail . in sec .",

    ", we denote @xmath45 the redshift function , for it is related to the gravitational redshift , and @xmath46 the shape function , as will be shown below by embedding diagrams , determines the shape of the tunnel ( in analogy to the analysis considered in @xcite ) .",

    "in addition to this , we also show below that @xmath59 at the throat , which implies a negative energy density at the throat .",
    "this condition is another significant difference to the morris - thorne wormhole , where the existence of negative energy densities at the throat is not a necessary condition .    by taking the derivative with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath25 , of eq .",

    "<S> traversable wormhole are primarily useful as `` gedanken - experiments '' and as a theoretician s probe of the foundations of general relativity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the possibility of having tunnels in a hyperbolic spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain exact solutions of static and _ pseudo_-spherically symmetric spacetime tunnels by adding exotic matter to a vacuum solution referred to as a degenerate solution of class @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties and characteristics of these intriguing solutions are explored , and through the mathematics of embedding it is shown that particular constraints are placed on the shape function , that differ significantly from the morris - thorne wormhole . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that the energy density is always negative and the radial pressure is positive , at the throat , contrary to the morris - thorne counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> specific solutions are also presented by considering several equations of state , and by imposing restricted choices for the shape function or the redshift function . </S>"
