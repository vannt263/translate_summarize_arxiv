    "<S> the structure of graphite oxide ( go ) has been systematically studied using various tools such as sem , tem , xrd , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ft - ir ) , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , @xmath0c solid state nmr , and o _ k_-edge x - ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tem data reveal that go consists of amorphous and crystalline phases . </S>",
    "<S> the xps data show that some carbon atoms have @xmath1 orbitals and others have @xmath2 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath1 bonded carbon atoms decreases as sample preparation times increase . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0c solid - state nmr spectra of go indicate the existence of -oh and -o- groups for which peaks appear at 60 and 70 ppm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ft - ir results corroborate these findings . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of ketone groups is also implied by ft - ir , which is verified by o k - edge xanes and @xmath0c solid - state nmr . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new model for go based on the results ; -o- , -oh , and -c = o groups are on the surface .    * 1 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction *    graphite is made up of layers of graphene , which is a conductive two - dimensional structure . </S>",
    "<S> since it has a layered structure , it also has a large surface area which renders it suitable for intercalation or adsorption . if it is oxidized in air , co and co@xmath3 are produced . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the oxidation is carefully controlled in a laboratory , it becomes insulating graphite oxide ( go ) . after oxidation , </S>",
    "<S> go still keeps a layered structure with some distortions . </S>",
    "<S> recently , go has attracted much attention because graphene can be manufactured with go at low cost@xcite and go can be used as a transparent and flexible electronic material after reduction@xcite or reaction with naoh@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is reported that go can be used to make metal nanoparticles@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the exact structure of go still remains elusive despite its various applications . </S>",
    "<S> since it was first discovered in 1859 by brodie@xcite , four different preparation methods have been developed : the brodie process@xcite , the staudenmaier process@xcite , the hummers - offeman process@xcite and anodic oxidation of graphite electrodes in nitric acid@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four main structural models have been proposed for go : hofman s model@xcite , ruess s model@xcite , sholtz & boehm s model@xcite , and lerf & klinowski s model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hofmann first proposed that only epoxy ( -o- ) groups were situated on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> although hofmann s model explained the existence of epoxy ( -o- ) groups , it can not provide the information about other chemical groups including hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> ruess suggested that the carbon layers were wrinkled and they consisted of trans - linked cyclohexane chairs . </S>",
    "<S> he first accounted for the hydrogen content in go . </S>",
    "<S> ruess s model was revised by scholz and boehm of which model says that ketone groups are present in go and carbon layers were corrugated .    </S>",
    "<S> lerf and klinowski proposed a new structural model based on solid - state nmr experiments in 1998 , and their model has been well received . </S>",
    "<S> they assumed that hydroxyl ( -oh ) and epoxy ( -o- ) groups exist in go and carboxyl ( -cooh ) groups are located at the edges of layers . in spite of the explanation on epoxy and hydroxyl groups , this model leaves some unanswered questions . </S>",
    "<S> first , even though the carboxyl groups are present at the edge region in the model , their nmr data do not confirm the existence of carboxyl groups . </S>",
    "<S> second , hydroxyl groups are closely located to each other in the model , causing the electrical instability because of their mutual electrostatic repulsion . for these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> lerf s model needs to be revised , although lerf @xmath4@xcite modified their model with an explanation of the dynamics of chemical groups in go . </S>",
    "<S> we conducted various experiments to investigate the structure of go .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2 . experimental methods *    * a. preparation * in this work , the go samples were prepared by the brodie process@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the brodie process is as follows : 5.0of graphite ( 99.99+purity , 45 , aldrich ) was added into 62.5of fuming nitric acid ( hno@xmath5 ) . after cooling this mixture in an ice bath , 25.0of potassium chlorate ( kclo@xmath5 ) was slowly added . after the mixture had reached room temperature , it was placed in a water bath , heated slowly to a temperature of 45and kept at this temperature for 20 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the mixture was poured into 125of cold distilled water and warmed to 70 , and then the mixture was centrifuged and decanted . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was washed three times in this manner and dried overnight at 70 .    </S>",
    "<S> * b. characterization of the samples * the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) . </S>",
    "<S> xrd patterns were recorded using a rigaku powder diffractormeter with cu @xmath6 radiation with a step size of 0.02@xmath7 . to characterize the shape and structure of the samples </S>",
    "<S> , we also used a fei philips xl30 sfeg scanning ellectron microscope ( sem ) , a fei philips tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope ( tem ) , and a thermo nicolet avatar 360 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( ftir ) . </S>",
    "<S> the elemental compositions of the samples were identified by energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and x - ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) experiments were performed on the bach beamline at elettra in italy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0c solid - state nmr spectra were obtained at 9.4 tesla using a bruker avance 400 mhz spectrometer and 4 @xmath8 zirconia magic angle spinning ( mas ) rotors spun in air at 6 khz . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0c mas spectra with high - power decoupling ( hpdec ) were acquired at 100 mhz with 100 khz 90@xmath7 pulses of 1.25 @xmath9s duration . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10h-@xmath0c cross - polarization ( cp ) mas spectra were recorded at the different contact times ( 50 - 5050 @xmath9s ) with an increment of 500 @xmath9s .    * </S>",

    "<S> results and discussion *    figure 1(a ) shows a picture of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> it looks dark brown . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(b)-(d ) shows the sem images of the sample with different magnifications . </S>",
    "<S> it looks like coarse powders in figure 1(b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has straight lines and edges in in figure 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1e - f show the tem images of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(e ) reveals that the sample is made up of layers . </S>",
    "<S> the inset is the diffraction pattern of the region . since the spot - like and circular </S>",
    "<S> diffraction patterns appear , there must be two phases : an amorphous phase and a crystalline phase , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(f ) is another region of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the average width of stripes is 22 @xmath11 ( 9 stripes in 200 @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stripes appear black and white in turn . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the crystallinity in the region of figure 1f . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern is clear and spots are hexagonally arranged , indicating that the region is crystalline . </S>",
    "<S> thus , tem data confirm that go is composed of two phase regions : amorphous and crystalline phases @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> edx analysis were conducted over go and naoh - reacted - go ( naoh - go)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> go and naoh - go show two big peaks . </S>",
    "<S> one is from carbon , the other is from oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these two peaks , naoh - go shows a tiny peak from na . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic ratio of c to o for go is 6:2.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of c to o and na for naoh - go is 6:3.2:0.4 .    </S>",
    "<S> .principal characteristics obtained by xrd [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 3 compares xrd patterns of the samples ; graphite , go , and naoh - go@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> graphite has the main peak at 26.82@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> after oxidation , the maximum of the main peak moves toward the left , meaning that the interlayer distance increases and the structure is modified . </S>",
    "<S> a small amount of diffuse scattering underlies this bragg signature , implying the onset of a coexistent amorphous phase of go . </S>",
    "<S> after go has reacted with naoh , the xrd pattern of naoh - go shows many peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these additional peaks are due to the structural deformation which occurs by the decomposition of the epoxy groups into hydroxyl and -ona groups . </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition leads to a marked increase in a coexistent amorphous phase of go , as evidenced by the broad envelope of diffuse scattering that underlies the bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the xrd patterns of the samples were also analyzed with the scherrer formula@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , the mean crystallite diameter ( _ d _ ) , the interlayer distance ( _ d/2 _ ) and the average number of sheets in the mean crystallite ( _ n _ ) are given in table 1 . the interlayer distance increases after the oxidation . </S>",
    "<S> it increases further after the reaction with naoh . </S>",
    "<S> this is because more and more chemical groups are formed between the layers after oxidation and the reaction with naoh . </S>",
    "<S> _ n _ decreases after graphite is oxidized . </S>",
    "<S> however , it increases after naoh decomposes epoxy groups in go . </S>",
    "<S> it might be due to space charges caused by the decomposition of epoxy groups . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen atoms have higher electronegativity than carbon , hydrogen , and sodium atoms ( the electronegativity of carbon is 2.55 , that of sodium is 0.93 , that of hydrogen is 2.20 , and that of oxygen is 3.44@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> charges transfer from carbon , hydrogen , and sodium atoms to oxygen atoms because charge transfer depends on electronegativity . sodium and hydrogen atoms bonded with oxygen atoms </S>",
    "<S> have positive charges ( na@xmath12 and h@xmath12 ) , while oxygen atoms have negative charges(o@xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as more hydroxyl groups and -ona groups are produced between the layers of the sample , more charges are transferred to oxygen atoms and more charges are localized between the layers because go is an insulator . as a result , _ </S>",
    "<S> n _ might increase due to the electrostatic interaction among the chemical groups .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the ft - ir spectra of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> there are four main peaks centred at 1050 , 1380 , 1680 and 3470 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 1050 @xmath14 arises from epoxy ( -o- ) groups . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 1680 @xmath14 corresponds to the vibrational mode of the ketone ( -c = o ) groups . </S>",
    "<S> the peak observed at 1380 @xmath14 is assigned to a c - o vibrational mode . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 3470 @xmath14 denotes c - oh stretching . </S>",
    "<S> peaks below 900 @xmath14 are not usually interpreted because they represent too complex a structural signature . </S>",
    "<S> the peak from epoxy groups in go becomes weak after reaction of go with naoh which can decompose the epoxy ( -o- ) groups into hydroxyl ( -oh ) groups and -ona groups , while the peak from hydroxyl groups grows bigger , revealing that more hydroxyl groups were produced during the decomposition of the epoxy groups . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ft - ir data verify the existence of epoxy groups in go and demonstrate that -c = o and -oh groups are present .    </S>",
    "<S> to study what kind of carbon atoms are present in go , xps measurements were made on the bach beamline at elettra in italy . </S>",
    "<S> xps spectra were acquired using a 150 mm vsw hemispherical electron analyzer with a 16-channel detector . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the incident photon were calibrated by measuring the au 4f photoelectron core level . </S>",
    "<S> xps spectra of the four different samples are exhibited in figure 5 . </S>",
    "<S> graphite has two peaks in figure 5(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 284.5 @xmath15 represents c - c bonds with @xmath16 orbitals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small peak at 289 @xmath15 is from plasmons@xcite which is a collective behavior of the delocalized valence electrons of graphite . </S>",
    "<S> go shows two main peaks at 284.5 and 287.6 @xmath15 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first peak corresponds to c - c with @xmath16@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other peak originates from c - o in alcohol which is bonded with @xmath17 orbitals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no bending or warping occurs in the regions of carbons bonded with @xmath16 orbitals , whilst bending or warping occurs in the regions of carbons bonded with @xmath17 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> due to the bending and the coexistence of different orbitals , amorphous phases appear in go . in reacting with naoh ( figure 5(c ) and </S>",
    "<S> figure 5(d ) ) , more hydroxyl groups are produced . after reacting long enough with naoh </S>",
    "<S> , most epoxy groups ended up to be decomposed into -oh and -ona groups . </S>",
    "<S> the xps data confirm that epoxy groups in go decompose to hydroxyl groups and -ona groups .    </S>",
    "<S> to identify in more detail which chemical groups are in go , @xmath0c solid - state nmr experiments were conducted . in characterizing solid materials with solid - state nmr , it would be better to compare the high - power decoupling ( hpdec ) spectrum of samples with the cross - polarization magic angle spinning ( cpmas ) spectrum of them , since we can know which peaks come from carbon atoms near hydrogen atoms by comparing the spectra@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6(a ) shows the @xmath0c mas spectrum of go with high - power decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> there are four main peaks at 60 , 70 , 130 and 195 ppm from tetramethylsilane ( tms ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6(b ) illustrates the @xmath0c cp - mas spectra of go recorded using different contact times . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the peaks increases with contact time . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are the most intense at 2550 @xmath9s , and their intensity decreases afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6(c ) shows the @xmath0c cpmas spectrum of go with the contact time of 2550 @xmath9s , and four main peaks appear at 60 , 70 , 130 and 195 ppm from tms . </S>",
    "<S> compared with figure 6(a ) , the intensity of the peak at 70 ppm in figure 6(c ) becomes bigger and the peak intensity at 60 ppm in figure 6(a ) is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the peak at 60 ppm , which does not cross - polarize , must come from the epoxy group@xcite , and the peak at 70 ppm , which is influenced by the nearby hydrogen , must be from the hydroxyl group@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks at 130 ppm are from aliphatic groups@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the broad peak at 195 ppm does not cross - polarize </S>",
    "<S> . it could be possibly from ketone groups@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is no @xmath0c peak near 175 ppm which comes from carboxyl ( -cooh ) group@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since carboxyl groups have hydrogen , its @xmath0c peak must be cross - polarized if the groups are really present in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , solid - state nmr spectra indicate that there are epoxy , hydroxyl , and ketone groups in the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> it is very important to check whether or not ketone groups are present in go . </S>",
    "<S> although the peak at 195 ppm in the solid - state nmr spectra does not cross - polarize and the peak position is very similar to that of ketone groups , much care should be taken in interpreting the data and concluding that it is from ketone groups . </S>",
    "<S> xanes is one of the powerful techniques to characterize materials . </S>",
    "<S> although it is not easy to examine ketone groups in go with c @xmath18-edge xanes since the peak from @xmath19 appears at 285 @xmath15 and overlaps with that of @xmath20@xcite , o @xmath18-edge xanes can clearly distinguish ketone groups from other chemical groups . </S>",
    "<S> xanes spectra of go and naoh - go were collected in the total electron yield ( tey ) mode at room temperature , and they are displayed in figure 7 . </S>",
    "<S> peak a at 532 @xmath15 is from -c = o@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> peak b at 535 @xmath15 is from o - h@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> peak d at 539 @xmath15 is assigned to c - o in hydroxyl groups@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the intensity of peak c at 537 @xmath15 decreases after go reacts with naoh , it might originate from c - o in epoxy groups . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the existence of ketone , epoxy , and hydroxyl groups in go is confirmed by the xanes spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we investigated whether the ratio of @xmath16 orbitals to carbon atoms with @xmath17-hybridized orbitals in the go is influenced by sample preparation time . </S>",
    "<S> three more samples were prepared by the brodie method , and they were characterized by xps . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks of @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals were fitted with a gaussian function , and the ratio is plotted in figure 8 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 8 displays the ratio of carbon atoms with @xmath16 orbitals to carbon atoms with @xmath17-hybridized orbitals in the go samples against their preparation time . </S>",
    "<S> the line in figure 8 shows the least squares fit of an exponential function . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the ratio asymptotically approaches 0.3 @xmath21 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that it is not possible to prepare go samples with only @xmath17-hybridized orbitals irrespective of the preparation time .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 9 proposes the new model for go in response to all results . </S>",
    "<S> as the hydroxyl groups have strong repulsion , they are not located close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> even though they seem to be located randomly in go , two neighboring hydroxyl groups are located on the opposite sites to decrease the repulsive force between them . </S>",
    "<S> epoxy groups are also separated far from hydroxyl groups in order to be electrically stable . </S>",
    "<S> ketone groups are also present in go    * conclusions * we investigated the structural properties of graphite oxide ( go ) with sem , tem , xrd , ft - ir , xps , @xmath0c solid - state nmr , and xanes . </S>",
    "<S> the tem data show that go consists of two regions : amorphous and crystalline . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of epoxy , hydroxyl , and ketone groups is corroborated by @xmath0c solid - state nmr , ft - ir , and xanes spectra . according to xps data , </S>",
    "<S> go is composed of two kinds of carbon atoms and the epoxy groups are vulnerable to naoh . </S>",
    "<S> we finally propose a new model for go , and it is illustrated in figure 9 . </S>"
