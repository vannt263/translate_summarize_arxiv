    "this type of collision couples a local quantum system with a finite number of discrete states  the projectile  to a large reservoir with a continuum of states  the target .",
    "irrespective of the coupling between the two , either due to tunneling or due to auger - type coulomb interaction , charge - transferring atom - surface collisions are thus perfect realizations of time - dependent quantum impurity systems .",

    "the fingerprint of correlations could be the experimentally found negative temperature dependence of the neutralization probability .",
    "it may arise  @xcite from thermally excited conduction band holes occupying the strongly renormalized @xmath0 configuration of the projectile which effectively stabilizes the impinging ion and reduces thereby the neutralization probability .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze the he - yarmoff experiment  @xcite from a genuine many - body theoretical point of view , following the seminal work of nordlander and coworkers  @xcite as well as merino and marston  @xcite and to provide theoretical support for the interpretation of the experiment in terms of a mixed - valence scenario .",

    "@xcite the time - dependent anderson model , written in terms of pseudo - operators  @xcite for the projectile states , is then subjected to a full quantum - kinetic analysis using contour - ordered green functions  @xcite and a non - crossing approximation for the hybridization self - energies as originally proposed by nordlander and coworkers .",

    "the reason for the discrepancy between the measured and the calculated data is unclear . the material parameters seem to be reasonable since the theoretical results have the correct order of magnitude .",
    "it could be however that the temperature - induced transfer of holes to the second ionization level is overcompensated by the electron - transfer to the first ionization level . in the region where charge - transfer is strongest the two ionization levels overlap .",
    "the absence of energy separation together with the conditional temporal weighting due to the dynamics of the collision process makes it very hard to tell a priori which process will win and manifest itself in the measured neutralization probability .",
    "so far , the discussion of the data left out the possibility of a correlation - induced sharp resonance in the vicinity of the fermi energy , that is , the key feature of kondo - type physics .",
    "the numerical results seem to suggest that either there is no resonance or it does not affect the neutralization process .",
    "however , from the data itself we can not determine which one is the case .",
    "we can thus not decide whether the sr : au system is in a correlated regime or not and hence whether an interpretation of the experimental data in terms of a mixed - valence scenario is in principle plausible or has to be dismissed .",
    "a rigorous way to decide this would be to calculate the instantaneous spectral functions for the projectile and to look for sharp resonances in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",

    "the mechanism for a negative temperature dependence , that is , the possibility of efficiently transferring holes to the second ionization level , is thus in principle present . for the material parameters however most appropriate for sr : au the negative temperature dependence arising from this channel seems to be overcompensated by the positive temperature dependence of the electron - transfer to the first ionization level . to proof that he and yarmoff have indeed seen  for the first time ",
