    "the intrinsic spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite driven by the relativistic spin - orbit interaction and the associated berry curvature of the bloch wavefunctions attracts considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally . in conducting materials such as doped gaas",
    ", the external electric field produces transport current and dissipation , even though the spin current transverse to it is dissipationless .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to design systems showing the she without dissipation .",
    "spin hall insulator ( shi ) has been proposed for this purpose by some of the present authors , and its candidate materials are hgte , pbte , @xmath3-sn and so forth @xcite .",
    "these band insulators are predicted to show finite spin hall conductivity @xmath4 , which is not quantized and depends on parameters in the model hamiltonian .",
    "later it has been realized that gapless edge modes in semi - infinite systems do not exist in generic cases .",
    "these two features , i.e. , the non - quantized @xmath4 and the absence of gapless edge modes , are closely related to the absence of conserved spin current in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , i.e. , there is no u(1 ) gauge symmetry for spin current . therefore it was difficult to distinguish between the shi and usual insulators .",
    "recently , kane and mele proposed a model for time - reversal ( t- ) invariant systems @xcite , which manifests a finite she and demonstrated its distinction from an ordinary insulator due to the topological nature of its ground state .",
    "the pertinent @xmath5 topology is represented by an integer @xmath6 defined for bloch wavefunctions in the bulk , whose parity distinguishes the relevant phases .",
    "physically , @xmath6 is identical with the number of pairs of helical edge modes . in a system with @xmath7 , referred to as quantum spin hall ( qsh ) system @xcite , the odd number of pairs of helical edge modes is robust against weak nonmagnetic disorder and interactions @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 gapless edge modes can hybridize each other and a gap will open even at the edge .",
    "the system is then referred to as spin hall insulator ( shi ) .",
    "transitions between phases with @xmath9 ( shi ) and @xmath7 ( qsh ) occur only when the gap is closed by tuning parameters of the model .",
    "constructing a theory for analyzing these transitions is a challenge of paramount interest .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an effective continuum theory for phase transitions between qsh and shi systems in 2d and discuss ( i ) classification of the possible types of transition , ( ii ) existence of gapless helical edge modes , and ( iii ) the change of the @xmath5 topological number at the transition .",
    "the basic idea is that effective continuum theory focusing on the vicinity of the gap - closing points at the transition can be constructed even though characterization of each phase requires information over the whole first brillouin zone .",
    "namely , the _ change _ across the phase boundary is much easier to elucidate , and the relation between the topological number and the helical edge modes is rather transparent .",
    "this work concerns local features in @xmath10 space , and is complementary to refs .  , which treats global topological structure in @xmath10 space .",
    "we ignore interaction and disorder effect in this paper , since the robustness of the system is inferred from the topological stability .",
    "since the phase transition necessarily accompanies closing of the gap @xcite , we commence with an analysis of generic gap - closing in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) gapped spin-@xmath11 t - symmetric system with spin - orbit interaction .",
    "a hamiltonian matrix for bloch wavefunctions can be written in a block form , @xmath12 the dimension of the matrix @xmath13 depends on systems considered ; nevertheless , in order to describe the phase transition , it is sufficient to restrict the dimension of the matrices @xmath14 to be one or two , as we will see later . to investigate the topological order of the hamiltonian",
    ", its spectrum is assumed to have a gap , within which the fermi energy lies .",
    "the t - symmetry is represented by the operator , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 are pauli matrices and @xmath17 stands for complex conjugation ) .",
    "for @xmath18 it implies , @xmath19 or , equivalently , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this , in turn , results in a degeneracy between states at @xmath10 and @xmath22 , forming kramers pairs .",
    "tuning some parameters in the hamiltonian may drive a transition , where the gap closes and degeneracies between the valence and the conduction bands occur at certain wavevectors @xmath23 . to pursue the phase transition",
    ", we will focus on _ `` generic '' _ gap - closing achieved by tuning a _ single _",
    "parameter @xmath24 .",
    "( for mere convenience , the critical value of @xmath24 for which a generic gap - closing occurs is chosen as @xmath25 . )",
    "non - generic gap - closing achieved by tuning _",
    "several _ parameters are excluded in our analysis .",
    "this is because such kind of gap - closing can be circumvented by small perturbation , meaning that it can not be associated with a phase transition . as we show below , generic gap - closing are classified into two cases shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ( a)(b ) ( depending on symmetry under parity ) .",
    "we note that while we have not made any assumption on the @xmath5 topological number , both cases ( a ) and ( b ) turn out to encode quantum phase transitions between the qsh and the shi phases . among the known models describing this kind of phase transition , the kane - mele model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite",
    "falls within class ( a ) while the hgte quantum well model @xcite belongs to class ( b ) .",
    "the qsh - shi phase transitions pertaining to fig .  [ fig : degeneracy ] ( a)(b ) are not so trivial as it might look . in general ,",
    "energy levels repel each other , thereby the valence and the conduction bands do not touch when the number of tuned parameters is not large enough .",
    "the number of tuned parameters to achieve degeneracy , called the codimension , is sensitive to the symmetry and the dimension of the system considered .",
    "for example , in three dimensions the gap - closing of the type ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] does not occur @xcite .",
    "consider now a spatial inversion ( i-)symmetry which plays an important role beside t - symmetry .",
    "the former requires the relation @xmath26 , while the latter implies @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy of band @xmath29 with pseudospin @xmath3 , and @xmath30 is the pseudospin opposite to @xmath3 @xcite . if both symmetries are respected , @xmath31 and there is a kramers double degeneracy at each @xmath10 .",
    "if i - symmetry is broken , double degeneracy occurs at points @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , where @xmath2 is a reciprocal lattice vector ; no double degeneracy occurs at other points ( unless an additional symmetry is present ) .",
    "the i - asymmetric and i - symmetric cases are therefore considered separately below .      in this case , when @xmath34 , each band is _ non - degenerate _ , and the gap between two bands can close at some points @xmath10 . at the gap - closing point ,",
    "one valence band and one conduction band become degenerate .",
    "the codimension is three @xcite",
    ". this codimension three is equal to the number of parameters involved , that is , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus the gap can close at some @xmath10 when the parameter @xmath24 is tuned to a critical value .    on the other hand , when @xmath32 , the band is doubly degenerate , and the codimension is five @xcite , exceeding the number of tunable parameters which is one ( that is , @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , generic gap - closing can not occur at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on the case @xmath37 . near the gap - closing point",
    "@xmath38 , the system s hamiltonian corresponds to massive two - component fermion , and can be expressed as @xmath39 ( after unitary and scale transformations ) .",
    "t - symmetry requires that the gap closes simultaneously at @xmath40 and @xmath41 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ( a ) , and that the masses at @xmath42 have opposite signs . in the honeycomb - lattice model for qsh",
    "@xcite the gap closes at the @xmath43 points ; hence it reduces to the present scheme without i - symmetry .          in this case",
    ", the energies are doubly degenerate at each @xmath10 . at the phase transition ,",
    "the gap between the two doubly - degenerate bands closes .",
    "hence , we consider 4@xmath444 hamiltonian matrix @xmath18 ( @xmath45 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) are 2@xmath442 ) .",
    "the i - symmetry is imposed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a unitary matrix independent of @xmath10 , and @xmath48 is the periodic part of the bloch wavefunction : @xmath49 . as the inversion does not flip spin ,",
    "this unitary matrix @xmath47 should be block - diagonal in spin space : @xmath50 in fact , all cases reduce to a case @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , as can be shown directly by applying a unitary transformation . @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the parity eigenvalues of the atomic orbitals .",
    "occurrence of gap closing turns out to be different for the cases ( i ) @xmath56 and ( ii ) @xmath57 .",
    "the case ( i ) @xmath58 is realized when the atomic orbitals @xmath59 , @xmath60 have the same parity , such as two @xmath61-like orbitals or two @xmath62-like orbitals .",
    "the ensuing constraints on the hamiltonian are : @xmath63 is an even function of @xmath10 , and @xmath64 is an antisymmetric matrix , even function in @xmath10 . in an explicit form ,",
    "the generic hamiltonian becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 s and @xmath67 are real even functions of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath68 are @xmath69 matrices given by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are pauli matrices acting on spin and orbital spaces , respectively .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath77 .",
    "the gap closes when @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "it means that the codimension is five , the same as in the case at @xmath1 without i - symmetry .",
    "thus there are no solutions of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath24 which satisfy these five relations .",
    "the gap never closes in this case .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 , where the two constituent atomic orbitals have different parity .",
    "the hamiltonian reads , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are even functions of @xmath10 , and @xmath85 are odd functions of @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath86 are @xmath69 matrices given by @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the gap closes only when five equations @xmath92 , @xmath93 are satisfied . for a generic point @xmath10 with @xmath37 , these five equations can not be satisfied simultaneously , through a change of a single parameter @xcite",
    ". on the other hand , at the high - symmetry points @xmath94 , the situation is different . at these points the odd functions @xmath85 vanish identically , and one has only to tune @xmath84 to be zero .",
    "thus , the gap closes by fine - tuning a single parameter . to be more specific ,",
    "we take @xmath95 as an example , and write down the hamiltonian explicitly .",
    "extension to other @xmath96 points is straightforward .",
    "the hamiltonian is expanded to linear order in @xmath10 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath24 are constants , and @xmath99 @xmath100 are two - dimensional real constant vectors .",
    "further simplification is obtained after judicious unitary transformations .",
    "the hamiltonian finally acquires the block - diagonal form , @xmath101 where @xmath102 with real constants @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "note that in materials with high crystallographic symmetry ( e.g tetragonal ) , one has @xmath106 and @xmath107 , leading to @xmath108 .",
    "we have thus demonstrated a feature : _ the hamiltonian of a generic system with spin - orbit coupling obeying t- and i- symmetries decouples , after an appropriate choice of basis , into a pair of hamiltonians describing two - component fermions with opposite sign of the corresponding mass terms . _",
    "( such decoupling is expected in the special case where @xmath109 is a good quantum number , since the system describes two copies of a quantum hall system ) .",
    "experimental consequences are immediate as the hamiltonian ( [ eq : case - b ] ) is equivalent to the one suggested for the hgte quantum well in ref .",
    "( based on phenomenological arguments ) .",
    "gap closing at @xmath95 when the parameter @xmath24 is tuned to zero is now obvious , since the eigenenergies are @xmath110 .",
    "the inversion matrix in this basis is written as @xmath111 .",
    "summing up to this point , we discussed generic types of gap closing in time - reversal invariant systems , achieved by tuning a single parameter .",
    "taking i - symmetry into consideration , two types of gap - closing scenarios have been found : ( a ) simultaneous gap closing at @xmath112 occur in systems without i - symmetry , and ( b ) gap closing between two kramers - degenerate bands ( i.e. four bands ) at @xmath1 occur in systems with i - symmetry ( see fig .  [ fig : degeneracy ] ) . due to the level repulsion",
    ", the gap - closing by tuning a single parameter occurs only in limited cases .",
    "we will see in the subsequent discussion that these cases of gap - closing exactly coincides with the phase transition between the qsh and the insulating phases . in this sense",
    "our theory characterizes the qsh phase from the local features in @xmath10 space .",
    "now we focus on the change of @xmath5 topological number at the gap closing , assuming that except for the gap closing ( @xmath25 ) the bands are fully gapped .",
    "hence , both phases at @xmath113 and @xmath114 are band insulators , and have well - defined @xmath5 topological numbers . for the i - symmetric case ( a ) , the homotopy characterization in ref .",
    "is applicable ; for the lower band at the critical value @xmath25 , there is one vortex at @xmath115 and one antivortex at @xmath116 .",
    "thus , when the parameter @xmath24 is tuned across @xmath25 , the chern number for the whole contracted surface @xcite changes by one .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 topological numbers are different by one for the @xmath113 and the @xmath114 sides .",
    "one of the phases is the qsh phase , while the other is the shi . for the i - symmetric case ( b ) ,",
    "fu and kane @xcite developed a simple method to calculate the @xmath5 topological number @xmath6 as @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the four high - symmetry points satisfying @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the parity eigenvalue at each of these points , and @xmath121 is the number of kramers pairs below @xmath122 . in the present case the gap at @xmath95 collapses when @xmath25 .",
    "hence only the parity eigenvalue at @xmath95 can change at the phase transition . since the inversion matrix is given by @xmath123 ,",
    "the parity eigenvalues are @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the lower - band states at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "hence , the parity eigenvalue changes sign , and the @xmath5 topological number @xmath6 changes by one .",
    "thus , on the two sides of the band touching , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , one of the phases is the qsh phase , while the other one is the simple insulator ( shi ) phase .",
    "let us regard the usual insulating phase as our vacuum , so that the domain wall between the qsh phase and the insulating phase is the edge of the sample .",
    "such a domain wall is described by a spatially dependent mass parameter @xmath126 satisfying @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath128 we do not specify the detail of the crossover between @xmath129 and @xmath130 , because it is not important for the subsequent discussions . for fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy](a ) , one can consider the weyl fermions at @xmath131 separately .",
    "masses of these weyl fermions change sign at @xmath25 ; hence they yield the edge states localized at the domain wall , as explained in ref .  .",
    "because the weyl fermions at @xmath131 are related to each other by time - reversal symmetry , the two edge states form a kramers pair .    for fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy](b ) with a domain wall ( [ eq : dw ] ) , we follow the discussion in ref .   to show that such domain wall between phases with different @xmath5 topological number possesses one kramers pair of edge states at the boundary . in this case",
    "we consider    @xmath132    to calculate the eigenstates it is convenient to perform unitary transformation as @xmath133    where @xmath134 we omit the term @xmath98 henceforth , since it does not affect the subsequent discussions .",
    "the eigenvalue problem reads as @xmath135 .",
    "because ( [ eq : case - b - dm - u ] ) is block - diagonal , we first solve the eigenvalue problem for the first two components of @xmath136 , i.e we put @xmath137 .",
    "we get @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "they yield eigenequations for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively : @xmath143 when we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : dddag ] ) for @xmath141 , one can calculate @xmath142 from ( [ eq : du1 ] ) . as ( [ eq : dddag ] )",
    "is invariant under @xmath144 , it seems that the solutions for @xmath145 and @xmath146 are always obtained simultaneously , namely there is a spectral symmetry between @xmath147 .",
    "nevertheless , it does not apply if @xmath148 , where ( [ eq : du1 ] ) can not be solved for @xmath142 .",
    "a similar situation occurs for @xmath149 .",
    "thus exceptions at @xmath150 occur in the following way . for @xmath151 which satisfies @xmath152 , we get @xmath153 and @xmath154 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : du2 ] ) and ( [ eq : du1 ] ) , whereas there is no solution with @xmath155 . in the same token , for @xmath142 which satisfies @xmath156 , we get @xmath155 from ( [ eq : du2 ] ) , whereas there is no solution with @xmath153 . hence the spectral asymmetry is related to the kernels for @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "for simplicity we take @xmath159 henceforth , while the other case of @xmath160 can be studied in a similar way . for the domain wall ( [ eq : dw ] ) , the solution of @xmath152 gives @xmath161 and @xmath153 , while @xmath156 has no normalizable solution .",
    "thus the energy dispersion in @xmath162 direction has a branch @xmath153 , which crosses the fermi energy @xmath163 .",
    "this state is gapless , localized near @xmath164 .    ) .",
    "kramers theorem guarantees that the crossing of two edge states occur at @xmath165 . ]",
    "so far we have solved the eigenequation for the first two components .",
    "the lower two components of the wavefunction @xmath166 is obtained from above by time - reversal operation ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "therefore , the above - mentioned edge state with @xmath149 has a kramers partner with @xmath168 .",
    "the whole dispersion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "thus we have shown that the kramers pair of edge states exists at the boundary between the two phases .",
    "they cross at @xmath165 , as is guaranteed by the kramers theorem .",
    "a general framework is established for classifying phase transitions between the quantum spin hall and the insulator phases . for inversion - asymmetric systems ,",
    "the phase transition accompanies a gap closing at @xmath42 which is not at the high - symmetry points . for inversion - symmetric systems ,",
    "the gap closes only at @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a reciprocal vector .",
    "all the known models exhibiting phase transition between the two phases are special cases of this general classification framework .",
