    "a large number of problems in multi - user information theory fall under the general setup of distributed source coding .",
    "the most general framework for a distributed source coding problem consists of a set of encoders which observe different correlated components of a vector source and communicate their quantized observations to a central decoder through a rate - constrained noiseless communication link .",
    "the decoder is interested in reconstructing these observations or some function of them to within some distortion as measured by a fidelity criterion .",
    "the goal is to obtain a computable single - letter characterization of the performance limits measured by the rates of transmission and the distortions achieved .",
    "such a formulation finds wide applications in many areas of communications such as sensor networks and distributed computing .",
    "there is a vast body of work that addresses this problem , and solutions have been obtained in a variety of special cases @xcite .",
    "all of the existing works use the following canonical encoding strategy .",
    "each encoder has two operations , implemented sequentially , each of which is a many - to - one mapping : ( a ) quantization and ( b ) binning . in quantization ,",
    "typically , neighboring source sequences are assigned a codeword , whereas in binning , a widely separated set of codewords is assigned a single index which is transmitted over a noise - free channel to the decoder .",
    "the decoder looks for the most likely tuple of codewords , one from each source , and then obtains a reconstruction as a function of this tuple of codewords .    in most of these works ,",
    "existence of good encoders and decoder is shown by using random vector quantization followed by random independent binning of the quantizer codebooks .",
    "the best known inner bound to the performance limit that uses this approach is the berger - tung inner bound .",
    "it has been shown in the literature that this is optimal in several cases .",
    "the work of korner and marton @xcite , however , is an exception and looks at a special case of the problem involving a pair of doubly symmetric binary sources and near lossless reconstruction of the sample - wise logical xor function of the source sequences .",
    "they considered an encoding strategy where the first operation is an identity transformation .",
    "for the second operation , they consider random structured binning of the spaces of source sequences and show optimality .",
    "further , the binning of two spaces is done in a `` correlated '' fashion using a binary linear code . in the present paper",
    ", we build on this work , and present a new achievable rate region for the general distributed source coding problem and demonstrate an encoding scheme that achieves this rate region by using random coding on structured code ensembles . in this approach",
    ", we consider the case where the sources are stationary discrete memoryless and the reconstruction is with respect to a general single - letter fidelity criterion .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in an unified treatment of the problem that works for any arbitrary function that the decoder is interested in reconstructing .",
    "further , our approach relies on the use of nested group codes for encoding .",
    "the binning operation of the encoders are done in a `` correlated '' manner as dictated by these structured codes .",
    "this use of `` structured quantization followed by correlated binning '' is in contrast to the more prevalent `` quantization using random codes followed by independent binning '' in distributed source coding .",
    "this approach unifies all the known results in distributed source coding such as the slepian - wolf problem @xcite , korner - marton problem @xcite , wyner - ahlswede - korner problem @xcite , wyner - ziv problem @xcite , yeung - berger problem @xcite and berger - tung problem @xcite , under a single framework while recovering their respective rate regions .",
    "moreover , this approach performs strictly better than the standard berger - tung based approach for certain source distributions . as a corollary",
    ", we show that nested linear codes can achieve the shannon rate - distortion function in the single source point - to - point setting . a similar correlated binning strategy for reconstructing linear functions of jointly gaussian sources with mean",
    "squared error criterion was presented in @xcite .",
    "the present work develops a similar framework based on group codes .",
    "this rate region is developed using the following two new ideas .",
    "first , we use the fact that any abelian group is isomorphic to the direct sum of primary cyclic groups to enable the decomposition of the source into its constituent `` digits '' which are then encoded sequentially .",
    "second , we show that , although group codes may not approach the shannon rate - distortion function in a single source point - to - point setting , it is possible to construct non - trivial group codes which contain a code that approaches it . using these two ideas , we provide an all - group - code solution to the problem and characterize an inner bound to the performance limit using single - letter information quantities .",
    "we also demonstrate the superiority of this approach over the conventional coding approach based on unstructured random codes for the case of reconstructing the modulo-@xmath0 sum of correlated binary sources with hamming distortion .",
    "special cases of the general problem of distributed source coding with joint distortion criterion have been studied before .",
    "the minimum rate at which a source @xmath1 must be transmitted for the decoder to enable lossless reconstruction of a bivariate function @xmath2 with perfect side information @xmath3 was determined in @xcite .",
    "the case when the two communicators are allowed to exchange two messages was also considered . a two terminal interactive distributed source coding problem where the terminals exchange potentially infinite number of messages with the goal of reconstructing a function losslessly was studied in @xcite .",
    "a similar problem of function computation from various sensor measurements in a wireless network was studied in @xcite in the context of a packet collision model .",
    "prior work on group codes : good codes over groups have been studied extensively in the literature when the order ( size ) of the group is a prime which enables the group to have a field structure .",
    "such codes over galois fields have been studied for the purpose of packing and covering ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "two kinds of packing problems have received attention in the literature : a ) combinatorial rigid packing and b ) probabilistic soft packing , i.e. , achieving the capacity of symmetric channels .",
    "similarly , covering problems have been studied in two ways : a ) combinatorial complete covering and ( b ) probabilistic almost covering , i.e. , achieving the rate - distortion function of symmetric sources with hamming distortion .",
    "some of the salient features of these two approaches have been studied in @xcite . in the following we give a sample of works in the direction of probabilistic packing and covering .",
    "elias @xcite showed that linear code achieve the capacity of binary symmetric channels .",
    "a reformulation of this result can be used to show @xcite that linear codes can be used to losslessly compress any discrete source down to its entropy .",
    "dobrushin @xcite showed that linear codes achieve the random coding error exponent while forney and barg @xcite showed that linear codes also achieve the expurgated error exponent .",
    "further , these results have been shown to be true for almost all linear codes .",
    "gallager @xcite shows that binary linear codes succeeded by a nonlinear mapping can approach the capacity of any discrete memoryless channel .",
    "it follows from goblick s work @xcite on the covering radius of linear codes that linear codes can be used to achieve the rate distortion bound for binary sources with hamming distortion .",
    "blinovskii @xcite derived upper and lower bounds on the covering radius of linear codes and also showed that almost all linear codes ( satisfying rate constraints ) are good source codes for binary sources with hamming distortion .",
    "if the size of the finite field is sufficiently large , it was shown that in @xcite that linear codes followed by a nonlinear mapping can achieve the rate distortion bound of a discrete memoryless source with arbitrary distortion measure .",
    "wyner @xcite derived an algebraic binning approach to provide a simple derivation of the slepian - wolf @xcite rate region for the case of correlated binary sources .",
    "csiszar @xcite showed the existence of universal linear encoders which attain the best known error exponents for the slepian - wolf problem derived earlier using nonlinear codes . in @xcite ,",
    "nested linear codes were used for approaching the wyner - ziv rate - distortion function for the case of doubly symmetric binary source and side information with hamming distortion .",
    "random structured codes have been used in other related multiterminal communication problems @xcite to get performance that is superior to that obtained by random unstructured codes . in @xcite , a coding scheme based on sparse matrices and ml decoding",
    "was presented that achieves the known rate regions for the slepian - wolf problem , wyner - ziv problem and the problem of lossless source coding with partial side information .",
    "codes over general cyclic groups were first studied by slepian @xcite in the context of signal sets for the gaussian channel .",
    "forney @xcite formalized the concept of geometrically uniform codes and showed that many known classes of good signal space codes were geometrically uniform .",
    "biglieri and elia @xcite addressed the problem of existence of group codes for the gaussian channel as defined by slepian .",
    "forney and loeliger @xcite studied the state space representation of group codes and derived trellis representations which were used to build convolutional codes over abelian groups .",
    "an efficient algorithm for building such minimal trellises was presented in @xcite .",
    "loeliger @xcite extended the concept of the @xmath4-psk signal set matched to the @xmath4-ary cyclic group to the case of matching general signal sets with arbitrary groups .",
    "building codes over abelian groups with good error correcting properties was studied in @xcite .",
    "the distance properties of group codes have also been extensively studied . in @xcite , bounds were derived on the minimum distance of group codes and it was also shown that codes built over nonabelian groups have asymptotically bad minimum distance behavior .",
    "group codes have also been used to build ldpc codes with good distance properties @xcite .",
    "the information theoretic performance limits of group codes when used as channel codes over symmetric channels was studied in @xcite .",
    "similar analysis for the case of turbo codes and geometrically uniform constellations was carried out in @xcite . in @xcite , ahlswede established the achievable capacity using group codes for several classes of channels and showed that in general , group codes do not achieve the capacity of a general discrete memoryless channel .",

    "this coding strategy shall be referred to as the korner - marton coding scheme from here on .",
    "the crucial part played by linear codes in this coding scheme is noteworthy .",
    "had there been a centralized encoder with access to @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the coding scheme would be to compute @xmath163 first and then compress it using any method known to achieve the entropy bound . because the encoding is linear",
