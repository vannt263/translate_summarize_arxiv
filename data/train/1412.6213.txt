    "<S> quantum mechanics is an outstandingly successful description of nature , underpinning fields from biology through chemistry to physics . at its heart </S>",

    "<S> yet it is still unclear what the wavefunction actually is : does it merely represent our limited knowledge of a system , or is it an element of reality ? </S>",
    "<S> recent no - go theorems@xcite argued that if there was any underlying reality to start with , the wavefunction must be real . </S>",
    "<S> however , that conclusion relied on debatable assumptions , without which a partial knowledge interpretation can be maintained to some extent@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a different approach is to impose bounds on the degree to which knowledge interpretations can explain quantum phenomena , such as why we can not perfectly distinguish non - orthogonal quantum states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we experimentally test this approach with single photons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that no knowledge interpretation can fully explain the indistinguishability of non - orthogonal quantum states in three and four dimensions . assuming that some underlying reality exists , our results strengthen the view that the entire wavefunction should be real . </S>",
    "<S> the only alternative is to adopt more unorthodox concepts such as backwards - in - time causation , or to completely abandon any notion of objective reality .    _ </S>",
    "<S>  do you really believe the moon exists only when you look at it ? \" _ albert einstein s famous question encapsulates a century - old debate over the measurement problem and the very nature of the quantum wavefunction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not all scientists  including in particular quantum bayesianists@xcite  believe that our observations of the physical world can be entirely derived from an underlying objective reality . </S>",
    "<S> if one does however want to maintain a realist position at the quantum level , a question naturally arises : does the wavefunction directly correspond to the underlying reality , or does it only represent our partial knowledge about the real state of a quantum system ?    there are compelling reasons to subscribe to the latter , _ epistemic _ view@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the wavefunction is a state of knowledge , seemingly inconvenient quantum phenomena such as wavefunction collapse can be explained elegantly : if the wavefunction represents knowledge , a measurement only collapses our ignorance about the real state of affairs , without necessarily changing reality ; there is thus no physical collapse in the epistemic picture , but rather a reassignment of a more appropriate wavefunction in the light of new information . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the indistinguishability of nonorthogonal quantum states , which in the epistemic picture can be explained by a lack of information about the actual underlying reality . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been an open question whether the epistemic view , together with the assumption of an underlying objective reality , is compatible with quantum measurement statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> let us formalize this question . </S>",
    "<S> adopting the view that some underlying objective reality exists and explains quantum predictions , we shall denote the `` real state of affairs '' that completely specifies a given physical system by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the preparation of a system in a quantum state @xmath1 may not determine @xmath0 uniquely ; instead , it determines a classical distribution @xmath2 over the set of @xmath0 s , describing the probability that the preparation results in a specific state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum measurement statistics on @xmath1 are then assumed to be recovered after averaging over @xmath0 , with the probability distribution @xmath2 , which is assumed to be independent of the measurement being carried out .    </S>",
    "<S> a model that reproduces quantum predictions within the above framework is called an _ _ ontological model__@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath0 are called _ ontic states _ ( or , historically , _ hidden variables _ ) , while the distributions @xmath2 are called _ epistemic states_. specific examples of ontological models include those that involve hidden variables in addition to a real wavefunction , as was famously suggested by einstein - podolsky - rosen@xcite to address the alleged `` incompleteness '' of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> another example was formulated by john bell in his celebrated theorem@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall however not consider bell s additional assumption of local causality@xcite ; we are rather interested in the correspondence between the wavefunction that describes the quantum state of a ( single ) quantum system and its possible ontic states .    </S>",

    "<S> the epistemic states ( i.e. probability distributions ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to any two distinct pure states @xmath1 and @xmath4 , fig .  1a </S>",

    "<S> a breakthrough in the study of these models was recently made by pusey , barrett and rudolph in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they showed a no - go theorem suggesting that @xmath5-epistemic models were _ not _ compatible with quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> however , their theorem and related ones that followed@xcite crucially relied on additional , somewhat problematic assumptions beyond the basic framework for these models . </S>",

    "<S> while completely ruling out @xmath5-epistemic models is impossible without such additional assumptions@xcite , one can still severely constrain them , and bound the degree to which they can explain quantum phenomena . in particular , it was shown theoretically@xcite that the limited distinguishability of non - orthogonal quantum states can not be _ fully _ explained by @xmath5-epistemic models for systems of dimension larger than @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this experimentally on indivisible quantum systems  single photons  in @xmath8 and @xmath9 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclusively rule out the possibility that quantum indistinguishability can be fully explained by any @xmath5-epistemic model that reproduces our observed statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we further establish experimental bounds on how much they can explain . </S>",
    "<S> our implementation relies on a result by branciard@xcite , which generalises the proof of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath5-epistemic model could explain the limited distinguishability of a pair of non - orthogonal quantum states @xmath10 as resulting from their two different preparation procedures sometimes producing the same ontic state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such an explanation is fully satisfactory only if the distinguishability of two states is fully explained by the classical overlap of the probability distributions . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of successfully distinguishing two quantum states using optimal quantum measurements must be the same as that of distinguishing the two corresponding epistemic states , given access to the ontic states . </S>",
    "<S> these probabilities are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , where @xmath13 is the quantum overlap of the two states and @xmath14 \\text{d}\\lambda$ ] is the classical overlap of the probability distributions@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath25 the probability for the outcome @xmath26 , when performing the measurement @xmath22 on the state @xmath27 , the following inequality has to be satisfied by maximally @xmath5-epistemic models@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> it is therefore not surprising , but noteworthy that , in contrast to bell inequalities , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) is not theory - independent , in the sense that quantum theory is used explicitly to calculate the values of @xmath31 .    for non - maximally @xmath5-epistemic models </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 represents an upper bound on the smallest ratio between the classical and quantum overlaps @xmath33 for all states @xmath34 under consideration : the quantity @xmath35 then replaces the right - hand side of the inequality@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this quantifies and restricts how much of the indistinguishability of non - orthogonal quantum states can be explained through overlapping classical probability distributions .    in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we violate inequality   and aim to obtain the lowest possible value for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we use quantum states @xmath36 ( qutrit ) and @xmath37 ( ququart ) dimensions , prepared on single photons . </S>",
    "<S> these photons are created in pairs in a spontaneous parametric down - conversion process , and one photon is used as a trigger to herald the presence of a signal photon in the experiment .    </S>",

    "<S> b * experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> pairs of single photons are created via spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktiopo@xmath40 ) crystal pumped by a @xmath41  nm diode laser@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heralded signal photon is prepared in the initial state @xmath42 by means of a glan - taylor polariser ( gt ) . the subsequent half - wave plate ( hwp ) </S>",

    "<S> using only one output port of the final analysing polariser and one single - photon detector ( apd ) ensures maximal fidelity of the measurement process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while additional quarter - wave plates ( qwps ) could be used to access the full ( complex ) state space , this is not necessary for the present experiment . </S>",

    "<S> the computational basis states are @xmath47 , where the index denotes the spatial mode and @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to horizontal and vertical polarisation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the photon polarisation was manipulated with half - wave plates and polarising beam displacers . </S>",
    "<S> the path degree of freedom was controlled through an interferometer formed by half - wave plates and two beam displacers . using this setup we are able to prepare and measure arbitrary states of the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . in the qutrit case </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath46 was not populated .    </S>",
    "<S> while the derivation of inequality   makes no assumptions on the measurements@xcite , it is crucial to ensure accurate preparation of the states @xmath52 , as these are used to calculate the quantum overlaps @xmath31 . to this end , every optical element in the experimental setup was carefully calibrated and characterised . for increased precision and elimination of any systematic bias in the measurement , </S>",
    "<S> only one output port of the setup was used and the three outcomes @xmath53 of each measurement @xmath22 were obtained sequentially . </S>",
    "<S> this design might , however , be susceptible to imperfections in the optical components and one has to make sure that the normalised sum of the measurement operators for the three outcomes is the identity operator . using the calibration data for our optical elements we have bounded the average drop in measurement fidelity caused by these imperfections to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities @xmath25 were estimated from the normalised single - photon count rates . </S>",
    "<S> on average , we obtained @xmath55 coincidence counts per measurement , with an integration time of @xmath56  s per setting .    in principle@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , inequality   can be violated to an arbitrary degree for @xmath57 , that is @xmath32 can range arbitrarily close to @xmath58 , if one uses a sufficiently large number of states @xmath59 . however , increasing @xmath59 also requires a quadratic increase in the number of measurements on these states , which rapidly becomes infeasible in practice . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a violation is already possible with as few as @xmath60 states and is becoming more pronounced as @xmath59 increases . </S>",
    "<S> we chose to prepare up to @xmath61 qutrit states and @xmath62 ququart states , see methods , and performed a series of @xmath9 independent measurements for each configuration of @xmath6 and @xmath59 .    for @xmath61 qutrit ( @xmath36 ) states , </S>",

    "<S> the individual measurements agree well with the expected performance of the setup ( red - shaded rectangles representing 1@xmath68 regions ) and the advantage of using higher - dimensional systems is illustrated in the inset of fig .  3 , where we compare the cases @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> while there is no advantage expected for @xmath70 with the states we use@xcite , it is clear that @xmath32 decreases more quickly with @xmath59 for @xmath37 .     for the @xmath37 case . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : results ]    as one can see in fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , the gap between experimental and theoretical @xmath32-values increases with @xmath59 , due to the compound error resulting from the quadratic increase of the number of required measurements . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , a further increase of @xmath59 does not yield lower @xmath32-values . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the optimal trade - off is reached for @xmath65 and despite slightly lower experimental @xmath32-values no more significant violation of inequality   could be achieved for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the extensive number of measurements and long measurement times , which cause larger fluctuations and relative errors in the data . to illustrate this </S>",
    "<S> we have performed at least 3 experimental runs for every data point . </S>",
    "<S> the spread of these values around the shaded regions increases with @xmath59 , since the estimation of the experiment s performance does not account for long - term drifts of the interferometer . </S>",

    "<S> we do , however , rely on fair - sampling@xcite  the physically reasonable assumption that the detected events are a fair representation of the overall ensemble  to account for optical loss and inefficient detection . in the methods we estimate that , with the states and measurements used in this work , an average detection efficiency above @xmath79 would be required for ruling out maximally @xmath5-epistemic models without relying on fair - sampling . </S>",
