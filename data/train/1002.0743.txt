    "since the historical work of arago  @xcite and pasteur  @xcite , chirality ( the handedness of nature ) has generally been associated with optical activity , that is the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light passing through a medium lacking mirror symmetry  @xcite .",
    "optical activity is nowadays a very powerful probes of structural chirality in varieties of system .",
    "however , two - dimensional chiral structures , such as planar molecules , were not expected to display any chiral characteristics since simply turning the object around leads to the opposite handedness ( we remind that a planar structure is chiral if it can not be brought into congruence with its mirror image unless it is lifted from the plane ) . this fundamental notion was recently challenged in a pioneering study where it was shown that chirality has a distinct signature from optical activity when electromagnetic waves interact with a 2d chiral structure and that the handedness can be recognized  @xcite . while the experimental demonstration was achieved in the giga - hertz ( mm ) range for extended 2d structures , the question remained whether this could be achieved in the optical range since the laws of optics are not simply scalable when downsizing to the nanometer level . here",
    "we report genuine optical planar chirality for a single subwavelength hole surrounded by left and right handed archimedian spirals milled in a metallic film .",
    "key to this finding is the involvement of surface plasmons , lossy electromagnetic waves at the metal surfaces , and the associated planar spatial dispersion  @xcite .",
    "our results reveal how , in a stringent and unusual way , this optical phenomenon connects concepts of chirality , reciprocity and broken time symmetry .",
    "+ we remind that partly boosted by practical motivations , such as the quest of negative refractive lenses  @xcite or the possibility to obtain giant optical activity for applications in optoelectronics , there is currently a renewed interest  @xcite in the optical activity in artificial photonic media with planar chiral structures .",
    "it was shown for instance that planar gammadionic structures , which have by definition no axis of reflection but a four - fold rotational invariance  @xcite , can generate optical activity with giant gyrotropic factors  @xcite .",
    "importantly , and in contrast to the usual three dimensional ( 3d ) chiral medium ( like quartz and its helicoidal structure  @xcite ) , planar chiral structures change their observed handedness when the direction of light is reversed through the system  @xcite .",
    "this challenged lorentz principle of reciprocity  @xcite ( which is known to hold for any linear non magneto - optical media ) and stirred up considerable debate  @xcite which came to the conclusion that optical activity can not be a purely 2d effect and always requires a small dissymmetry between the two sides of the system  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless zheludev and colleagues did demonstrate in the ghz spectrum that a pure 2d chiral structure lacking rotational symmetry can have an optical signature which is distinct from optical activity  @xcite .",
    "they went on to predict that it should be possible to observe the same phenomena in the optical range by scaling down their fish - scale structure and playing on localized plasmons  @xcite . following a different strategy",
    ", we show here that sp waves propagating on a 2d metal chiral grating resonantly excited by light provide an elegant solution to generate planar optical chirality in the visible .",
    "this is a challenging issue as it leads to two fundamental points which are apparently incompatible . on the one hand ,",
    "finding such a 2d chiral effect in the optical domain is not equivalent to a simple rescaling of the problem from the ghz to the visible part of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , losses in metal become predominant at the nanometer scale so that the penetration length of light through any chiral structure will become comparable to the thickness of the structure .",
    "in - depth spatial dispersion along the propagation direction of light will hence be induced , corresponding to the usual 3d optical activity  @xcite .",
    "one thus expects optical activity , through the losses , to be a more favorable channel than 2d optical chirality . on the other hand ,",
    "losses ( i.e. , broken time invariance at the macroscopic scale ) are necessary to guarantee planar chiral behavior  @xcite . with this in mind , we chose to make single sp structures such as a single hole in an optically thick metal film surrounded by an archimedian spirals ( figure 1 ) which can provide all the necessary ingredients for observing 2d optical chirality .",
    "it is a 2d structure lacking point symmetry , that is rotational and mirror invariances . at the same time",
    ", it resonates due to coupling to surface plasmons which , as lossy waves , represent a natural way for delocalizing information along a planar interface , moving in - depth losses to the surface .",
    "importantly , the thickness of the metal film optically decouples both interface  @xcite , and consequently only the structured chiral side is involved in the 2d optical chiral effect reported here .",
    "finally , the structures gives rise to enhanced transmission  @xcite enabling high optical throughput for all the characterization measurements .",
    "+ using focus ion beam ( fib ) , we milled in an opaque gold film a clockwise ( right @xmath0 ) or anticlockwise ( left @xmath1 ) archimedian spiral grooves around a central subwavelength hole . the polar equation @xmath2 of the left handed archimedian spiral is @xmath3 , and the right handed enantiomeric spiral is obtained by reflection across the y axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the parameters characterizing the structure are the following : hole diameter @xmath4 nm , film thickness @xmath5 nm , grating period @xmath6 nm , groove width @xmath7 nm , and groove depth @xmath8 nm . the structures are milled , with a focus ion beam , in a gold film deposited on a glass substrate . on the bottom panel : transmission spectra at normal incidence of individual left ( blue curve ) and right handed ( red curve ) archimede spirals illuminated from the air side .",
    ", width=321 ]    the geometrical parameter @xmath9 is the radial grating period and we take its value equal to the sp wavelength @xmath10 nm ( for an excitation at @xmath11 nm ) .",
    "we recorded optical transmission spectra at normal incidence with unpolarized light for both isolated structures ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "as it can be seen , both enantiomers behave like resonant antennas with quasi identical transmission properties .",
    "this resonant behaviour is a direct indication of the sp excitation by the grating similarly to what is observed for circular antennas  @xcite . + to observe and fully characterize the optical signature of planar chirality we perform a full polarization tomography  @xcite with the aim of determining the 4@xmath124 mueller matrix @xmath13 associated with each enantiomer .",
    "experimental results @xmath14 , and @xmath15 respectively obtained for left and right handed spirals are given in appendixes a and b. here the important point is that the degree of purity @xmath16 of the mueller matrices  @xcite is near unity with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this shows that the coherence in polarization is not degraded by the structure and that we can therefore restrict our discussion to jones matrices  @xcite .",
    "in the convenient left @xmath19 and right @xmath20 circular polarization basis , these jones matrices tie the excitation @xmath21 $ ] to the transmitted @xmath22 $ ] electric fields . in the case of planar chiral structures displaying 2d chiral activity",
    ", they have the following form  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are complex valued numbers such that @xmath27 .",
    "this inequality account for chirality .",
    "being non diagonal , these matrices correspond to polarization converter elements with no rotational invariance around the @xmath28 axis ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "they are thus fundamentally different from jones matrices associated with optical activity , e.g. , gammadions .",
    "importantly the conditions @xmath27 implies the non unitarity of @xmath29 which means that reversing the light path through the chiral structures is not equivalent to reversing the time . from equation ( 1 )",
    "we deduce the associated theoretical forms for the mueller matrices @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( see appendix c ) which are used to fit @xmath32 and @xmath33 from experimental results .",
    "after normalization by @xmath24 we deduce @xmath34 these matrices indeed satisfy the chirality criteria of equation ( 1 ) within the @xmath35 uncertainty evaluated from the degree of purity of the mueller matrice of the empty setup .",

    "to illustrate the polarization conversion properties of our chiral structures , we compare in fig .  2 theory and experiment when",
    "the input state is linearly polarized and when the output transmitted intensity is analyzed along different orthogonal directions . a good agreement between the measurements and the theoretical predictions deduced from the jones matrices",
    "( see appendix d ) is clearly seen , together with the mirror symmetries between the two enantiomers .",
    "importantly , these symmetries also imply that for unpolarized light , and in complete consistency with fig .  1 , the total intensity transmitted by the structures is independent of the chosen enantiomer .",
    "furthermore , the conversion of polarization is well ( geometrically ) illustrated by using the poincar sphere representation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .  3",
    ", the mueller matrix defines a geometrical transformation which projects the unit poincar sphere , drawn by the input stokes vector , on an output closed surface with typical radius @xmath40 in agreement with the absence of net depolarization as already noticed ( from theory , @xmath41 exactly ) .",
    "data shown on fig .  2 are also plotted on this sphere .",
    "the input state draws a circle in the equator plane while the output state ( for each enantiomer ) draws a circle in a different plane , which center is not located at the center of the sphere .",
    "this is a direct manifestation of planar chirality ( see appendix e ) .",
    "there is clearly an antisymmetrical behaviour between both enantiomers .",

    "data points are compared with the predictions from @xmath44 ( continuous curves ) and of equation ( 2 ) ( dashed curves).,width=321 ]    the good agreement between the experiment and the prediction of equations ( 1,2 ) shows the sensitivity of the polarization tomography method and the high reliability of the fib fabrication .",
    "+ the degree of optical 2d chirality is quantified by diagonalizing @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for @xmath45 , the eigenstates are @xmath47 associated with the eigenvalues @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenstates for @xmath46 are obtained by permutation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with consequently @xmath49 .",
    "the scalar product @xmath50 is the eigenstates stokes parameter @xmath51 and provides a direct measurement of the degree of optical chirality .",
    "it also evaluates losses since the non - orthogonality of these two states is related to the necessary non - unitarity of the jones matrix for planar chirality .",
    "we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which , within experimental uncertainties , are in good agrement with the theoretical expectations . as shown in the insets of fig .  2 , both eigenstates of each structure ( e.g. , @xmath54",
    ") can be represented by two ellipses having the same axis ratio and the same handedness , but rotated @xmath55 relative to each other . in agreement with the theoretical predictions , these polarization ellipses for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are mirror reflections .",
    "this behaviour is significantly different from the results obtained with optically active media  @xcite where the eigenstates associated with a given enantiomer have opposite handedness  @xcite .",
    "this point , which reflects itself in the symmetry property of chiral jones matrices , namely @xmath58 , has far reaching consequences , as pointed out in reference  @xcite .",
    "it implies that a 2d plasmonic spiral mimics a faraday medium when we reverse the light path and this even if the system , unlike a true faraday medium , obeys rigorously to the principle of reciprocity  @xcite ( inversely , one can show that equation ( 1 ) results from both this requirement and the absence of mirror symmetry ) .",
    "it means that a photon coming from the second side will probe a structure of opposite chirality . after going through the structure and retracing back the light path with a mirror normal to the axis",
    ", the polarization state will be different at the end of journey from the initial one",
    ". this would be impossible for an optically active medium and is solely due to planar chirality . to summarize",
    ", our results therefore demonstrate that 2d chirality is possible in the visible domain in the absence of optical activity and add another element to the promising plasmonic toolkit .",
    "we apply a procedure similar to the one considered in @xcite in order to record the mueller matrix : a collimated laser beam at @xmath59 nm is focussed normally on the structure by using an objective @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , numerical aperture=0.55 ) .",
    "the transmitted light is collected and recollimated by using a second objective @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , numerical aperture=0.6 ) .",

    "+ two important points must be noted here : on the one hand we varied the incident illumination spot size on the sample between 2 and 20 @xmath64 m without affecting the matrix , i.  e. , without introducing additional depolarisation . in the rest of the experiment on chiral structures we consider the case of a large gaussian spot with fwhm=20 @xmath64 m in order to illuminate the whole individual spiral . on the other hand , it can be observed that in our experiments the polarization in the airy spot ( see fig .",
    "4b ) is homogeneous .",
    "this implies that we are actually doing the polarization tomography of the central transmitting hole , i.  e. , we are dealing only with the su(2 ) point symmetry of the mueller matrix .",

    "<S> light interacts differently with left and right handed three dimensional chiral objects , like helices , and this leads to the phenomenon known as optical activity . here , by applying a polarization tomography , </S>",
    "<S> we show experimentally , for the first time in the visible domain , that chirality has a different optical manifestation for twisted planar nanostructured metallic objects acting as isolated chiral metaobjects . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis demonstrate how surface plasmons , which are lossy bidimensional electromagnetic waves propagating on top of the structure , can delocalize light information in the just precise way for giving rise to this subtle effect . </S>"
