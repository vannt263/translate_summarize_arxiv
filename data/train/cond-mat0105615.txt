    "the dissolution of a solid material by contact with a reactive fluid is a fundamental process that underlies corrosion@xcite , diagenesis@xcite , erosion@xcite , etching@xcite , and many other industrial processes .",
    "the same dynamical process can also be viewed as the melting of a solid by heating the material at a single point in the interior@xcite .",
    "these types of dissolution ( or melting ) processes are described by the motion of the interface between the reactive fluid and the solid . in many situations , molecular diffusion is the transport mechanism for the reactive particles , and this leads to diffusion - controlled moving boundary value problems@xcite .",
    "= 2.8 in 0.15 in 0.1 in    in this work , we consider the kinetics of this dissolution process when there is a superimposed bias on the diffusive motion of the acid .",
    "such a bias can be easily realized , for example , by an electric field acting on ionized particles , or by a gravitational field or a pressure gradient acting on a flowing fluid .",
    "we find that the bias is a relevant perturbation with respect to molecular diffusion and gives rise to a dissolution process different from that caused by isotropic diffusion@xcite . as a function of time",
    ", the size of the dissolved region grows continuously and preferentially in the direction of the bias ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the basic questions that we shall study are the density profile of the acid particles inside the dissolved cavity , as well as the shape and time dependence of the boundary between the fluid and unreacted material .    in sec .",
    "ii , we first define the model and write the reaction diffusion equation that governs the density of reactive particles in the continuum limit . in sec .",
    "iii , we then solve for the steady state density profile of reactive particles in the dissolved cavity .",
    "this profile satisfies the anisotropic laplace equation , which is the time - independent limit of the basic equation of motion . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the motion of the interface and determine the different characteristic lengths of the cavity in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the bias .",
    "we briefly summarize in sec .",
    "v and also discuss a generalization of the system to variable acid strength .",
    "we consider the following microscopic dissolution process ( fig .  [ cartoon ] ) .",
    "initially all sites are unreacted .",
    "acid particles are injected at rate @xmath3 at the origin of a @xmath2-dimensional solid substrate .",
    "after injection , an acid particle undergoes biased diffusion until it hits a site at the interface between unreacted substrate and the dissolved cavity . in this interaction , both the host substrate site and the acid disappear .",
    "we can think of the acid as having unit strength so that one acid particle and one substrate particle are consumed in a reaction . later we will generalize to allow acid to dissolve many substrate sites before being neutralized . in the context of melting",
    ", we can think of particle injection as the localized input of heat and dissolution as the melting of the solid when heat reaches the interface .    in the limiting case where the reactive particles undergo isotropic diffusion ,",
    "the resulting dissolution process has been extensively studied , both in the context of melting@xcite and in the framework of diffusion - controlled reactions@xcite . here",
    "the radius of the dissolved region @xmath4 grows as @xmath5 and as @xmath6 for spatial dimension @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the density profile of the acid particles is also radially symmetric and asymptotically approaches a steady state as a function of the scaled radial distance @xmath9 .",
    "these results have a simple origin . in @xmath7 , for @xmath10 diffusing particles initially located at the origin , the furthest particle from the origin after time @xmath11 will be a distance of the order of @xmath12@xcite . thus if @xmath13 acid particles are injected continuously at the origin , the most distant particle , and therefore the position of the interface should be @xmath14 from the origin . for @xmath15 , since each acid particle dissolves a single substrate particle , the dissolved volume can be at most @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , the radius can be no larger than @xmath6 for @xmath16 . within the dissolved cavity , the density profile of acid particles away from the interface approaches a static limit for @xmath17 .",
    "this density profile thus obeys the laplace equation and decays as @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath19 the density profile is not static and it can be obtained conveniently by a scaling solution@xcite .    in the presence of the bias , we need to consider separately the growth parallel and perpendicular to the bias .",
    "the dynamics of this anisotropic dissolution process is governed by @xmath20 , the concentration of acid at position @xmath21 within the dissolved region at time @xmath11 .",
    "this concentration obeys the convection - diffusion equation @xmath22 subject to the absorbing boundary condition @xmath23 for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the moving interface as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "here we have taken the bias direction as along @xmath27 .",
    "the motion of the interface is then governed by the flux of acid onto the interface @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the parameter which quantifies the acid strength . here",
    "we define this constant to be 1 and later generalize to arbitrary acidity .",
    "notice also that there is no convective contribution to this flux ( @xmath30 ) because of the absorbing boundary condition .",
    "a basic feature which simplifies much of the analysis is that the density profile of the acid within the dissolved region is stationary in time except near the boundary .",
    "this arises because the input of new particles compensates for their loss at the boundary .",
    "this same simplifying feature , which also applies in the case of isotropic diffusion for @xmath17 , ultimately stems from the transient nature of biased diffusion @xcite .",
    "we now exploit this stationarity to obtain the exact concentration profile of acid within the dissolved cavity .",
    "setting the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ cdeq ] ) equal to zero , an anisotropic laplace equation results . for zero bias , this gives the classical laplace equation with steady - state solution @xmath31 for @xmath17 .",
    "to find the corresponding solution in the presence of a bias , we perform a fourier transform of the anisotropic laplace equation to yield @xmath32 with solution @xmath33 inverting this fourier transform gives the steady - state acid concentration @xmath34 in the last step , we complete the square in the denominator and then shift @xmath35 by @xmath36 . the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ c_inv ] ) is@xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the modified bessel function .",
    "this exact solution has very different forms in the regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the interesting case of @xmath41 , we substitute the asymptotic expansion @xmath42 @xcite into eq .",
    "( [ steadysoln ] ) to obtain @xmath43 in the special cases of @xmath7 , 2 , and 3 , this reduces to @xmath44 conversely , for @xmath40 , @xmath45 decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the origin , with the length scale of this decay proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "to gain a fuller appreciation for time - dependent features and the motion of the interface , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the dissolution process .",
    "our simulations are based on simply tracking the motion of all the reactive particles .",
    "each particle performs a biased nearest - neighbor random walk on a @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice , with hopping probability equal to @xmath47 in the @xmath48 directions perpendicular to the bias , and equal to @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the @xmath51 directions , respectively .",
    "these hopping probabilities give a bias velocity @xmath52 , as well as a superimposed isotropic diffusion process , with the diffusion coefficient in all coordinate directions equal to @xmath53 .",
    "we henceforth fix the injection rate to be @xmath54 .",
    "each lattice site is initially regarded as one unit of solid material which disappears when it is contacted by a reactive particle .",
    "the choice of the bias in our simulations is dictated by basic physical considerations .",
    "if the bias velocity is too small , there is a long crossover time before the bias dominates over the diffusion . on the other hand , for a bias velocity which is close to the maximum value of @xmath55 ,",
    "the length of the dissolved region becomes extremely large and this requires considerable computer memory to store the data of the system map .",
    "for these reasons , we found it optimal to consider intermediate values of the velocity .    as a function of time an elliptically - shaped dissolved cavity grow",
    "in which the interface remains relatively smooth ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oval ] ) . within this cavity",
    ", there is a distribution of mobile reactive particles which have not yet reached the interface .",
    "these physical characteristics have different dependences in spatial dimension @xmath7 and in higher dimensions ; we therefore discuss these two cases separately .",
    "= 2.9 in 0.15 in 0.2 in      we first apply a simple flux balance argument@xcite to show that for @xmath39 the interface boundary @xmath4 moves with a fixed propagation velocity  defined to be @xmath56  which is less than the particle velocity @xmath57 .",
    "since the input of reactive particles occurs at rate @xmath3 , the particle flux in the @xmath58 direction is simply @xmath3 .",
    "thus a unit flux would lead to an interface velocity @xmath59 . on the other hand , in a reference frame that moves at velocity @xmath57 , the reactive particles are at rest while the substrate particles ( with density @xmath60 ) move with velocity @xmath61 . in this moving frame , a flux of substrate particles",
    "@xmath62 would lead to the interface moving at velocity @xmath63 .",
    "therefore a unit particle flux would give an interface velocity @xmath64 .",
    "since the reaction has the symmetrical stoichiometry @xmath65 , the two velocities under conditions of unit flux must be equal .",
    "this then leads to the interface velocity @xmath66    for @xmath67 , the density profile decreases sharply from the constant value @xmath68 ( eq .  ( [ cs2 ] ) to 0 .",
    "because the dissolution process is equivalent to the reaction @xmath69 with components approaching each other at finite velocity , the width of the reaction front is proportional to @xmath46 and does not grow in time@xcite .",
    "we have also verified these features by monte carlo simulation ( data not shown ) .      for @xmath16 ,",
    "let us locate the reactive particles by the @xmath2-dimensional cylindrical coordinates @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the @xmath73-dimensional radial vector perpendicular to the @xmath27 axis .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath74 to denote the position of the interface .",
    "since the dissolved cavity grows predominantly along the direction of the bias , we focus our attention on this downstream portion of the interface .",
    "= 3.0 in 0.05 in 0.2 in    we now determine how @xmath75 and @xmath76 depend on time .",
    "let us assume that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "since the motion of the reactive particles in the transverse direction is diffusive , we expect that @xmath79 .",
    "then the volume of the dissolved region is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath81 can not grow faster than @xmath13 , we must have @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath81 were to grow slower than @xmath13 , the number of reactive particles in the dissolved region would have to grow with time , in contradiction with the steady state density profile derived above .",
    "thus @xmath81 should grow linearly with time , from which we conclude that @xmath83 .",
    "hence @xmath84 these predictions are in very good agreement with our numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_r_parall ] ) .",
    "= 3.0in0.05 in 0.2 in    the dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath11 can also be determined independently from the density profile @xmath20 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath7 , @xmath20 approaches @xmath85 far from the interface , while @xmath20 assumes a traveling wave form near the interface , which rapidly decays from @xmath86 to 0 ( fig .  [ fig_shape2d ] ) . from the inset to this figure , we see that the width of this front does not grow in time .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) , we can then approximate the equation of motion for the interface as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the width of the front . substituting the asymptotic expansion for @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ steadysoln ] ) then gives @xmath90 . using this in @xmath91",
    ", we obtain @xmath92 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) .      to obtain the number of reactive particles , it is convenient to express their density profile in a scaled form",
    ". based on the time dependences of @xmath75 and @xmath93 , we introduce the scaled variables @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in terms of these scaled coordinates , @xmath96 using the asymptotic expansion of @xmath97 , and substituting the scaled variables into eq .",
    "( [ steadysoln ] ) , we obtain the scaling form for the density profile @xmath98    from this form , we easily obtain the time dependence of the total number of active particles @xmath99 to be @xmath100 this prediction is also in excellent agreement with our simulations ( fig .  [ fig_nt ] ) .",
    "= 3.0in0.05 in 0.2 in    alternatively , @xmath99 equals the difference between the number of injected particles and the volume of the dissolved region .",
    "we use this fact to provide a more precise form for the time dependence of the dissolved volume @xmath101 . by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) by the surface element @xmath102 , integrating over the dissolution interface , and using eq .",
    "( [ cdeq ] ) , we have @xmath103 the left hand side is simply equal to @xmath104",
    ". therefore we obtain the obvious conservation equation @xmath105 .",
    "then eq .  ( [ nt ] ) gives @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a constant related to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we studied the dissolution of a substrate when acid particles are continuously injected at a single point and there is an external field which causes these particles to undergo biased diffusion .",
    "the basic quantities of interest in this process are the concentration profile of the acid and the growth kinetics of the dissolved region . within the dissolved region ,",
    "the acid concentration follows the steady state profile of biased diffusion ; this is just the solution of the anisotropic laplace equation .",
    "the shape of the dissolved region is strongly anisotropic with its length growing in time as @xmath108 while the transverse width grows as @xmath109 .",
    "a simple and relevant extension of our model is to the case of variable acid strength .",
    "this can be realized by assuming a substrate density @xmath110 so that @xmath60 acid particles must hit a given substrate site before it dissolves ( weak acid ) or that an acid particle dissolves @xmath111 substrate sites before becoming neutralized ( strong acid ) . in the current model , @xmath112 .",
    "the case @xmath111 is equivalent to having a particle density in the substrate @xmath60 equal to @xmath113 and with an acid particle dissolving one substrate particle . incorporating this scaling behavior into eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) for the interface motion we have @xmath114    for @xmath110 , the dissolution boundary becomes smoother and grows more slowly since it takes many acid particles to dissolve each substrate site . for @xmath7 ,",
    "this follows immediately from the expression @xmath115 which was obtained from the flux balance argument ( sec .",
    "[ 1d ] ) . in general , eqs .",
    "( [ cdeq ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) are invariant after normalizing @xmath116 and rescaling @xmath117 .",
    "this means that a change of the substrate density or acid strength will only change the time scale through the injection rate .",
    "we have tested this hypothesis by simulations in which acidity @xmath118 varied between 1 and 160 . at short times , the dissolution boundary appears to be much rougher for @xmath119 .",
    "asymptotically , it appears that the boundaries for different values of @xmath60 approach a common limit .",
    "the overall effect of varying the acidity is simply to change the time scale .",
    "however , the subdominant terms to eqs .",
    "( [ rs ] ) and ( [ nt ] ) seem to have strong acidity dependence so that there is a long - lived transient correction to this simple scaling behavior ( fig .",
