    "two important issues of lepton number violation are intimately related to each other .",
    "one is the possible existence of neutrino majorana masses , as evidenced by the ongoing excitement generated by the recent report of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite , as well as previous other indications of solar @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillations .",
    "the other is one of the very challenging question in cosmology to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe starting from a symmetric universe @xcite .",
    "since the electroweak anomalous processes breaks both the baryon and the lepton numbers , still conserving the @xmath0 quantum number , the baryon asymmetry of the universe is no longer independent of the lepton number violation of the universe @xcite .",
    "if there is very fast lepton number violation before the electroweak phase transition , then that can erase the @xmath0 asymmetry of the universe @xcite and hence the baryon asymmetry of the universe . on the other hand , if any lepton asymmetry is generated at some high temperature , that can get converted to a baryon asymmetry of the universe before and during the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "lepton number violation is required to give a majorana mass to the neutrinos .",
    "depending on the scale at which this lepton number is violated , this interaction may or may not satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "if this interaction is faster than the expansion rate of the universe , it can erase all lepton asymmetry of the universe before the electroweak phase transition . in those models",
    "one then require additional inputs to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe . on the other hand , in models of leptogenesis the lepton number violating interaction required to give majorana masses to the neutrino also satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "if there is enough cp violation in the leptonic sector @xcite , then this can generate a @xmath0 asymmetry of the universe . the anomalous baryon number violation in the presence of the sphalerons",
    "will then convert this @xmath0 asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry of the universe before the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to generate a baryon asymmetry of the universe during the electroweak phase transition @xcite , but the condition that this asymmetry will not be erased after the electroweak phase transition gives a strong bound on the mass of the higgs @xcite , which makes these less likely . as a result leptogenesis appears to be the most attractive scenario for generating a baryon asymmetry of the universe at present . in this article",
    "we shall thus summarise the possibility of leptogenesis in different models of neutrino masses .",
    "we shall first review the original idea of baryogenesis in the context of grand unified theories and show why @xmath0 is always conserved in the baryon asymmetry thus generated .",
    "then we show the relationship between the baryon and lepton number in the presence of the sphaleron processes and how @xmath1 is washed out .",
    "this also implies constraints on the lepton number violation and hence on the neutrino masses . at the end",
    "we discuss different classes of models of neutrino masses which can naturally accomodate leptogenesis and then summarise .",
    "the subject of baryogenesis originated when sakharov @xcite pointed out that for the generation of a baryon asymmetry of the universe we need three conditions    * _ baryon number violation _",
    ", * _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 violation _ , and * _ departure from thermal equilibrium_.    it was then realised that grand unified theories ( guts ) satisfies all these criterion @xcite .",
    "the quark - lepton unification implies baryon number violation in guts .",
    "since fermions belong to chiral representation , @xmath2 is maximally violated .",
    "departure from thermal equilibrium was also naturally satisfied in these models since the scale of unification is sufficiently high , and the universe was expanding very fast in that epoch .",
    "so , any reasonble gut coupling would imply departure from equilibrium .",
    "violation of @xmath3 was then the only crucial point , which had to be incorporated in these theories .",
    "however , it was not difficult to consider some of the couplings to be complex so that there exist tree level and one loop diagrams which could interfere to give us enough baryon asymmetry in the decays of the heavy gauge and higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "this was considered to be one of the major successes of guts that it can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "after several years it was realised that the chiral nature of the weak interaction also breaks the global baryon and lepton numbers in the standard model @xcite .",
    "although both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are broken , a combination @xmath0 remains invariant since the baryon and lepton number anomalies happens to be the same in the standard model .",
    "since these classical global @xmath1 number symmetry is broken by quantum effects due to the presence of the anomaly , these processes were found to be very weak at the zero temperature .",
    "but at finite temperature these @xmath1 number violating interactions were found to be very strong in the presence of some static topological field configuration - sphalerons @xcite .",
    "in fact , during the period @xmath6 these interactions are so strong that in no time the particles and anti - particles attain their equilibrium distributions . as a result ,",
    "since @xmath7 is conserved and hence the masses of the particles and anti - particles are same , the number density of baryons becomes same as that of the anti - baryons and that will wash out any primordial @xmath1 asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we shall now discuss why gut baryogenesis always generated only @xmath1 asymmetry @xcite , which would be erased by the sphaleron transitions .    in specific gut scenarios such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath10 is either a global or a local symmetry respectively .",
    "hence the asymmetry generated by the above mechanism is @xmath10 conserving @xcite .",
    "when the scalar or vector bosons decay only into fermions , any attempt to generate a @xmath11 asymmetry leads to its large suppression in all these models . we shall now prove that if the decay products are sm fermions only , this is in fact a generic property of any baryon asymmetry generated by the above described mechanism .",
    "this follows from an operator analysis analogous to the one used to show that the minimal scenarios of proton decay conserve @xmath0 @xcite . for definitness",
    "we consider scalars @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but obviously the result generalizes also to vectors .",
    "baryogenesis is possible in guts because there exist new gauge and higgs bosons , whose decays violate baryon number . when these heavy particles ( say @xmath12 ) decay into two quarks and into a quark and an antilepton , the baryon and lepton numbers are broken @xcite . for @xmath3 violation",
    "this mechanism requires two heavy gauge or higgs bosons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , each of which should have two decay modes , @xmath14 so that there exist one - loop vertex corrections to these decays .",
    "the required @xmath3 violation occurs due to the interference between tree and loop diagrams . as required by the out - of - equilibrium condition",
    ", masses of these particles must satisfy @xmath15 where , @xmath16 is the decay rate of the heavy particle @xmath12 ; @xmath17 is the hubble constant ; @xmath18 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom ; and @xmath19 is the planck scale .",
    "let us start from the lagrangian giving the decays of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denote any sm fermion . to obtain a nonzero @xmath3 violation from the interference between tree and vertex diagrams , we require @xmath12 and @xmath13 to be distinct from each other and to have different decay modes .",
    "one can then write down all possible combinations of @xmath22 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath23 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and find out the decay modes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "since the out - of - equilibrium condition and the nonvanishing of the absorptive part of the loop integral require these scalars @xmath12 and @xmath13 to be much heavier than the fermions , we can integrate them out and write down the diagrams in terms of the four - fermion effective operators of the sm , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "one can in principle also have the self - energy - type diagrams with the fermions in the loop for generating the @xmath3 asymmetry . in this case , after integrating out the heavy scalars , the effective diagrams in terms of the four - fermion operators are exactly the same as in the vertex - correction case , so the conclusions will not be changed .",
    "3.75in.1 in    -.2 in    this simple but crucial step allows us to use existing knowledge on sm four - fermion operators for baryon number violation which have been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was found that all these operators conserve @xmath0 to the lowest order .",
    "any @xmath0 violating operator will be suppressed by @xmath24 compared to the @xmath1 violating operators . in models with an intermediate symmetry breaking scale or with new higgs scalars at some intermediate scales , this suppression factor may be softened a little , but still strong enough to rule out any possibility of generating enough @xmath0 asymmetry of the universe . on the other hand , any four - fermion operator which violates only lepton",
    "number requires all the fermions to be the same ; hence it can not generate the required @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "therefore a @xmath0 asymmetry , needed to survive the sphaleron processes , is impossible to generate with the sm four - fermion operators .",
    "anomaly breaks any classical symmetry of the lagrangian at the quantum level .",
    "so , all local gauge theories should be free of anomalies",
    ". however , there may be anomalies corresponding to any global current , which means that such global symmetries of the classical lagrangian are broken through quantum effects . in the standard model",
    "the baryon and lepton number global symmetries are anomalous @xcite @xmath25\\ ] ] which will break the @xmath1 symmetry . however , the anomaly corresponding to the baryon and lepton numbers are same and as a result there is no anomaly for the @xmath0 charge .",
    "because of the anomaly @xcite , @xmath1 is broken during the electroweak phase transition , but their rate is very small at zero temperature , since they are suppressed by quantum tunnelling probability , @xmath26 $ ] .    at finite temperature , this @xmath1 number violation becomes very fast in the presence of a non - trivial static topological soliton configuration , called the sphalerons @xcite , and the quantum tunnelling suppression factor is now replaced by the boltzmann factor @xmath27 $ ] where the potential or the free energy @xmath28 is related to the mass of the sphaleron field . as a result , at temperatures between @xmath29",
    "the sphaleron mediated baryon and lepton number violating processes are in equilibrium .",
    "for the simplest scenario of @xmath30 , the sphaleron induced processes are @xmath31 , given by , @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{sph}\\ ] ] it can be shown that any @xmath0 asymmetry before the electroweak phase transition will get converted to a baryon and lepton asymmetry of the universe , which can be seen from an analysis of the chemical potential @xcite .    above the electroweak scale , all the particles",
    "could be assumed to be ultrarelativistic .",
    "the particle asymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the number of particles ( @xmath33 ) and the number of antiparticles ( @xmath34 ) can be given in terms of the chemical potential of the particle species @xmath35 ( for antiparticles the chemical potential is @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 where @xmath38 for bosons and @xmath39 for fermions .",
    "in the standard model there are quarks and leptons @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; where , @xmath42 corresponds to three generations .",
    "in addition ,",
    "the scalar sector consists of the usual higgs doublet @xmath43 , which breaks the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath44 down to @xmath45 . in table 1",
    ", we presented the relevant interactions and the corresponding relations between the chemical potentials . in the third column",
    "we give the chemical potential which we eliminate using the given relation .",
    "we start with chemical potentials of all the quarks ( @xmath46 ) ; leptons ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ) ; gauge bosons ( @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and 0 for all others ) ; and the higgs scalars ( @xmath51 ) .",
    ".relations among the chemical potentials [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the chemical potentials of the neutrinos always enter as a sum and for that reason we can consider it as one parameter .",
    "we can then express all the chemical potentials in terms of the following independent chemical potentials only , @xmath52 . we can further eliminate one of these four potentials by making use of the relation given by the sphaleron processes , @xmath53 .",
    "we then express the baryon number , lepton numbers and the electric charge and the hypercharge number densities in terms of these independent chemical potentials , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of higgs doublets @xmath43 .    at temperatures above the electroweak phase transition , @xmath56 ,",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath58 must vanish , while below the critical temperature @xmath57 should vanish , but since @xmath59 is now broken we can consider @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these conditions and the sphaleron induced @xmath62 conserving , @xmath63 violating condition will allow us to write down the baryon asymmetry in terms of the @xmath62 number density as , @xmath64 thus the baryon asymmetry of the universe after the electroweak phase transition will depend only on the primordial @xmath0 asymmetry of the universe , while all the primordial @xmath1 asymmetry will be washed out .    before proceeding further , we shall briefly discuss what do we mean when we say that some interaction is fast and that will erase some asymmetry @xcite . in equilibrium",
    "the number density of particles with non - zero charge @xmath65 would be same as the antiparticle number density since the expectation value of the conserved charge vanishes .",
    "a mathematical formulation of this statement reads that the expectation value of any conserved charge @xmath65 is given by , @xmath66}{{\\rm tr } \\left [ e^{-\\beta h}\\right]}\\ ] ] and since any conserved charge @xmath65 is odd while @xmath17 is even under @xmath67 transformation this expectation value vanishes .",
    "so for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe we have to circumvent this theorem either by including nonzero chemical potential , or go away from equilibrium or violate @xmath67 . in",
    "most of the popular models @xmath67 conservation is assumed and one starts with vanishing chemical potential for all the fields which ensures that the entropy is maximum in chemical equilibrium . then to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe one needs to satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition @xcite .",
    "the requirement for the out - of - equilibrium condition may also be stated in a different way @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the chemical potential associated with @xmath4 is zero and @xmath67 is conserved , then in thermal equilibrium the phase space density of baryons and antibaryons , given by @xmath68^{-1}$ ] are identical and hence there can not be any baryon asymmetry .",
    "whether a system is is equilibrium or not can be understood by solving the boltzmann equations . but a crude way to put the out - of - equilibrium condition is to say that the universe expands faster than some interaction rate . for example , if some b - violating interaction is slower than the expansion rate of the universe , this interaction may not bring the distribution of baryons and antibaryons of the universe in equilibrium .",
    "in other words , before the chemical potentials of the two states gets equal , they move apart from each other .",
    "thus we may state the out - of - equilibrium condition as @xmath69 where , @xmath70 is the interaction rate under discussion , @xmath18 is the effective number of degrees of freedom available at that temperature @xmath71 , and @xmath19 is the planck scale .",
    "in the standard model there is no lepton number violation .",
    "however , one can consider a higher dimensional effective operator which violates @xmath0 , given by @xmath72 there is no origin of such interactions within the standard model .",
    "so one expects that some new interaction at some high energy will give us this effective interaction at low energy .",
    "the scale of the new interaction @xmath73 , which is also the scale of lepton number ( and also @xmath0 number ) violation , will determine if this interaction is fast enough to erase all primordial @xmath0 asymmetry . since during the same time @xmath1 asymmetry is also washed out by the sphaleron transitions , there will not be any residual baryon asymmetry of the universe after the electroweak phase transition . as a result",
    ", the survival of the baryon asymmetry of the universe will then require this interaction to be slower than the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath74 which gives a bound @xcite on the lepton number violating scale to be , @xmath75 .",
    "when the higgs doublets @xmath43 acquires a @xmath76 , the higher dimensional operator will induce a majorana mass of the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "this bound on the heavy scale @xmath73 will then imply a bound on the mass of the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath77    3.5in.6 in    -2 in    it is also possible to give a bound on the neutrino mass in a more general way @xcite . unless the neutrinos are dirac particles @xcite , during the electroweak phase transition there will be interactions of the type , @xmath78 which violate lepton number .",
    "these interactions are mediated by a virtual left - handed neutrino exchange as shown in figure 2 . here",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 are the generation indices .",
    "depending on the physical mass of the left - handed majorana neutrinos these processes can wash out any baryon asymmetry between the time when the higgs acquires a @xmath76 and the @xmath81 freeze out , _",
    "i.e. _ , between the energy scales 250 gev and 80 gev .",
    "the condition that these processes will be slower than the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath82 gives a bound on the majorana mass of the left - handed neutrinos to be , @xmath83 this bound is on each and every element of the mass matrix and not on the physical states .",
    "there are other lepton number violating interactions like the scattering processes @xmath84 ( mediated by a virtual left - handed neutrino ) and decays of @xmath85 and the higgs @xmath43 , which also give similar bounds on the left - handed neutrino mass",
    ".    in some specific models one may give stronger bounds on the mass of the neutrinos @xcite . in models with right",
    "handed neutrinos ( @xmath86 ) , the neutrino masses comes from the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the lepton sector containing the mass terms of the singlet right handed neutrinos @xmath87 and the yukawa couplings of these fields with the light leptons is given by ,    @xmath88    where @xmath43 is the usual higgs doublet of the standard model ; @xmath89 are the light leptons , @xmath90 are the complex yukawa couplings and @xmath91 is the generation index . without loss of generality we work in a basis in which the majorana mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos is real and diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath92 .    once the higgs doublet @xmath43 acquires a @xmath76 , the masses of the neutrinos in the basis @xmath93 $ ] is given by , @xmath94 where , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are @xmath97 matrices . in the limit when all eigenvalues of @xmath73 are much heavier than those of @xmath55 , and the matrix @xmath73 is not singular , this matrix may be block diagonalised .",
    "it then gives three heavy right handed majorana neutrinos with masses @xmath98 and the majorana mass matrix of the left - handed neutrinos will be given by , @xmath99 in this scenario the see - saw masses of the left - handed neutrinos explain naturally why they are so light .",
    "the decay of @xmath100 into a lepton and an antilepton , @xmath101 breaks lepton number .",
    "since the lightest of the right handed neutrinos ( say @xmath102 ) will decay at the end , this interaction ( @xmath102 decay ) should be slow enough so as not to erase the baryon asymmetry of the universe , which now implies @xmath103 which can then give a very strong bound @xcite on the mass of the lightgest of the left - handed neutrinos to be @xmath104    in models @xcite , where the left - handed neutrino mass is not related to any heavy neutrinos through see - saw mechanism , the abovementioned bounds may not be valid .",
    "in addition , there are several specific cases even within the framework of see - saw models ( like the singular see - saw mechanism where @xmath105 ) , where these bounds are not applicable .",
    "these bounds are also not valid if some global u(1 ) symmetry is exactly conserved up to an electroweak anomaly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in some very specific models where a baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated after the electroweak phase transition @xcite , or there are some extra baryon number carrying singlets which decays after the electroweak phase transition @xcite , it is possible to avoid all the bounds from constraints of survival of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we shall now discuss similar bounds on the supersymmetric r - parity violating and zee type radiative models .",
    "although the earlier bounds on the see - saw mechanism is not applicable when the decays of the right handed neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe , since leptogenesis is not possible in these r - parity breaking models or the zee - type models , in these models one needs additional inputs to generate a baryon asymmetry of the universe .    in the r - parity violating models ,",
    "the unavoidable lepton number violation at the supersymmetry breaking scale will erase any primordial @xmath4 or @xmath5 or @xmath106 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this is so unless @xmath107 is conserved @xcite even after the electroweak phase transition .",
    "this has been pointed out earlier from a general dimensional analysis , but none of the existing models of neutrino masses through r - parity violation could accomodate this symmetry since that can not allow required neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "possible solutions to this problem could be to break r- parity spontaneously after the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , or to generate a baryon asymmetry of the universe in r - parity breaking scenarios @xcite , or generate a baryon asymmetry of the universe during the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "but these models are incapable of accomodating the interesting feature of leptogenesis , namely generating a baryon asymmetry of the universe from the interaction which gives a neutrino mass .",
    "similarly the zee - type models @xcite considered so far can not account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , if they have to explain the present neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "although the radiative models have the advantage that they can reproduce the required maximal mixing naturally , they erase any primordial lepton asymmetry of the universe and hence the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this severe constraint on the zee - type models are also valid in both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "it is not impossible to find an alternative where a baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated after it has been washed out by this interaction , but that will not be related to the neutrino mass .    in the mssm",
    ", r - parity of a particle is defined as @xmath108 where @xmath4 is its baryon number , @xmath5 its lepton number , and @xmath109 its spin angular momentum . hence the sm particles have @xmath110 and their supersymmetric partners have @xmath111 . using the common notation where all chiral superfields are considered left - handed , the three families of leptons and quarks are given by @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath79 is the family index , and the two higgs doublets are given by @xmath114 where the @xmath115 content of each superfield is also indicated .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , the superpotential is restricted to have only the terms @xmath116 if r - parity is violated but not baryon number , then the superpotential contains the additional terms @xmath117 resulting in nonzero neutrino masses either from mixing with the neutralino mass matrix @xcite or in one - loop order @xcite .",
    "if lepton - number violating interactions such as @xmath118 are in equilibrium in the early universe , any pre - existing lepton asymmetry would be erased . to make sure that this does not happen , the following condition has to be satisfied : @xmath119 assuming that the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath120 is @xmath121 gev , we find @xmath122 which is very much below the typical minimum value of @xmath123 needed for radiative neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "a similar bound was presented from dimensional arguments @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath124 are allowed if there is a conserved @xmath125 symmetry @xcite",
    ". however , there would be other severe phenomenological restrictions in that case @xcite .",
    "this bound can not be evaded even if one uses the bilinear term for neutrino masses instead , because the induced mixing would introduce trilinear couplings which violate lepton number and an effective @xmath124 is unavoidable .",
    "this means that although r - parity violation may exist , it will have very little consequences .",
    "in particular , it will not contribute significantly to neutrino masses .    in models of radiative neutrino masses",
    "@xcite , in addition to the suppression due to the @xmath126 factor of each loop , there is often another source of suppression due to the yukawa couplings involved . in the original zee model ,",
    "the sm is extended to include a charged scalar @xmath127 and a second higgs doublet .",

    "( 8) constrains the combination @xmath144 , whereas @xmath145 goes like @xmath146 .",
    "hence neutrino masses would only decrease if we increase @xmath147 .",
    "as long as there is a suppression from @xmath138 ( which comes of course from the yukawa coupling @xmath148 ) , the conflict with leptogenesis is a real problem .",
    "in the standard model neutrinos are massless . to make them massive , there exist four generic mechanisms , namely , the see - saw mechanism @xcite , the triplet higgs mechanism @xcite , the radiative mass generation @xcite and through r - parity violation @xcite .",
    "all these models require lepton number violation , which can erase the primordial baryon asymmetry of the universe .",

    "because of the majorana mass term , the decay of @xmath100 into a lepton and an antilepton , breaks lepton number .",
    "there are two sources of cp violation in this scenario :    * vertex type one loop diagrams which interferes with the tree level diagram given by figure 3 .",

    "2.25in- .3 in    2.25in- .3 in    in the first paper on leptogenesis @xcite , the vertex type diagram was only mentioned .",
    "subsequently , it has been extensively studied @xcite and the amount of @xmath3 asymmetry is calculated to be , @xmath152 } { \\sum_\\alpha    main contribution to the asymmetry comes from the lightest right handed neutrino ( @xmath102 ) decay , when the other heavy neutrinos have already decayed away .    initially the self energy diagram was considered for @xmath3 violation as an additional contribution @xcite .",
    "it was then pointed out @xcite that this @xmath3 violation enters in the mass matrix as in the @xmath151 oscillation .",
    "before they decay , the right handed neutrinos were considered to oscillate to an anti - neutrino and since the rate of @xmath153 , an asymmetry in the right handed neutrino was obtained before they decay @xcite . as a result , when the two heavy right handed neutrinos are almost degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass difference is comparable to their width , there may be a resonance effect which can enhance the @xmath3 asymmetry by few orders of magnitude @xcite .",

    "the amount of cp asmmetry from the self energy contribution becomes equal to the vertex correction , which has to be added to get the final asymmetry .",
    "although the @xmath3 asymmetry was found to be non - vanishing , in thermal equilibrium unitarity and @xmath7 would mean that there is no asymmetry in the final decay product .",
    "however , when the out - of - equilibrium condition of the heavy neutrinos decay is considered properly , one could get an asymmetry as expected .",
    "consider the decays of @xmath154 and @xmath155 . if they were generated in the early universe , in a short time scale @xmath155 could decay and recombine , but @xmath154 may not be able to decay or recombine . as a result in the decay product",
    "there will be an asymmetry in @xmath156 and @xmath157 if there is @xmath3 violation . in the lepton number violating two body scattering processes",
    "@xmath3 violation in the real intermediate state plays the most crucial role , which comes since the decay take place away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "in the case of right handed neutrino decay , the asymmetry is generated when the lightest one ( say @xmath102 ) decay . before its decay ,",
    "the pre - existing lepton asymmetry is washed out by its lepton number violating interactions .",
    "so the out - of - equilibrium condition now implies that the lightest right - handed neutrino should satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition when it decays , which is given by , @xmath158 which gives a bound on the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino to be @xmath159 finally the lepton asymmetry and hence a @xmath0 asymmetry generated at this scale gets converted to a baryon asymmetry of the universe in the presence of sphaleron induced processes .      to give a majorana mass to the neutrino",
    ", one can either introduce a right handed neutrino as in the see - saw mechanism , or else one can introduce two complex @xmath59 triplet higgs @xcite scalars ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the @xmath76s of the triplet higgses can give small majorana masses to the neutrinos through the interaction @xmath161 + h.c.\\ ] ] if the triplet higgs acquires a @xmath76 and break lepton number spontaneously , then there will be majorons in the problem which is ruled out by precision z  width measurement at lep .",
    "however , in a variant of this model @xcite lepton number is broken explicitly through an interaction of the triplet with the higgs doublet @xmath162 let @xmath163 and @xmath164 , then the conditions for the minimum of the potential relates the @xmath76 of the two scalars by @xmath165 , where @xmath73 is the mass of the triplet higgs scalar and the neutrino mass matrix becomes @xmath166 .    in this case",
    "the lepton number violation comes from the decays of the triplet higgs @xmath167 , @xmath168 the coexistence of the above two types of final states indicates the nonconservation of lepton number . on the other hand , any lepton asymmetry generated by @xmath169 would be neutralized by the decays of @xmath170 , unless cp conservation is also violated and the decays are out of thermal equilibrium in the early universe . in this case",
    "there are no vertex corrections which can introduce cp violation .",
    "the only source of cp violation is the self energy diagrams of figure 5 .",
    "2.5in- .5 in    if there is only one @xmath171 , then the relative phase between any @xmath172 and @xmath35 can be chosen real .",
    "hence a lepton asymmetry can not be generated . with two @xmath171 s ,",
    "even if there is only one lepton family , one relative phase must remain . as for the possible relative phases among the @xmath172 s",
    ", they can not generate a lepton asymmetry because they all refer to final states of the same lepton number .    in the presence of the one loop diagram",
    ", the mass matrix @xmath173 and @xmath174 becomes different .",
    "this implies that the rate of @xmath175 no longer remains to be same as @xmath176 .",
    "since by @xmath7 theorem @xmath177 , what it means is that now @xmath178 \\neq \\gamma[\\xi_b \\to \\xi_a ] .$ ] this is a different kind of cp violation compared to the cp violation in models with right handed neutrinos . if we consider that the @xmath179 is heavier than @xmath180 , then after @xmath179 decayed out the decay of @xmath180 will generate an lepton asymmetry given by , @xmath181 } \\over { 8 \\pi^2 ( m_1 ^ 2 - m_2 ^ 2 ) } } \\left [ { { m_1 } \\over \\gamma_1 }   \\right].\\ ] ] in this model the out - of - equilibrium condition is satisfied when the masses of the triplet higgs scalars are heavier than @xmath182 gev .",
    "the lepton asymmetry thus generated after the higgs triplets decayed away would be the same as the @xmath0 asymemtry before the electroweak phase transition . during the electroweak phase transition",
    ", the presence of sphaleron fields would relate this @xmath0 asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry thus generated can then be given by the approximate relation @xmath183 .",
    "this allows us to obtain a neutrino mass of order ev or less , as well as the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe @xmath184 as desired .    in general",
    ", it is not possible to discriminate the see - saw mechanism from the triplet higgs mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "however , in some specific supersymmetric inflationary models , where the reheat temperature is lower than @xmath185 gev , the see - saw mechanism is preferred . on the other hand the leptogenesis scenario in the triplet higgs mechanism has several nice features , like the absence of the vertex diagrams or its detectability in the near future in the accelerators @xcite .",
    "however , in the left - right symmetric models both the scenarios are present and can contribute to the neutrino masses as well as to leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the majorana masses of the neutrinos implies lepton number violation .",
    "one very important consequence of this lepton number violation in the early universe is that it can erase any primordial baryon asymmetry of the universe in the presence of the sphaleron field before the electroweak phase transition .",
    "this gives bound on the mass on the neutrinos .",
    "while a general analysis can give somewhat weak bound , in some specific models these bounds could be very important .",
    "for example , in zee - type radiative models or the r - parity breaking supersymmetric models this is very restrictive .",
    "if one attempts to explain the atmospheric neutrino problem , then these models would wash out all primordial baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this implies that most models of neutrino masses based on these two scenarios are incomplete and more inputs are required to explain the present baryon asymmetry of the universe in these models . on the other hand , in the see - saw mechanism and the triplet higgs mechanism , the lepton number violation that gives masses to the neutrinos",
    "also generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe , which then get converted to a baryon asymmetry of the universe in the presence of the sphaleron field .",
