    "the generation and detection of strongly correlated atomic ensembles is becoming one of the central themes in the study of ultracold quantum gases , leading to the birth of the subfield of quantum - atom optics .",
    "recently there have been an increasing number of experiments probing the higher - order coherences and correlation functions that are fundamental to this field and are analogous to similar developments in the early days of quantum optics with photons .",
    "one of the first experiments in this area was the measurement of a two - time second - order correlation function in a thermal gas of metastable neon atoms falling on four microchannel plate ( mcp ) detectors @xcite .",
    "another early experiment was the measurement of the rate of three - body losses from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , from which the local third - order correlation function could be inferred @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the arsenal of experimental techniques to study higher - order correlations has been expanded to include the measurement of photoassociation rates @xcite , shot - noise spectroscopy of absorption images @xcite , atom counting using fluorescence imaging and high - finesse optical cavities @xcite , and position - resolved counting of metastable helium atoms using arrays of mcp detectors aspect , aspect - hbt - fermions , perrin - bec - collisions .",
    "proposals for additional techniques include atom counting using photoionization photoionization , and freeze - in techniques with optical lattices for _ in - situ _ measurements of non - local spatial correlations @xcite .",
    "the experimental systems that are being studied with these new techniques for correlation measurements include bose - einstein condensates and degenerate fermi gases @xcite , atom lasers @xcite , one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi-1d bose gases @xcite , bose and fermi gases in optical lattices @xcite , four - wave mixing via bec collisions @xcite and molecular dissociation of becs @xcite .",
    "the last two systems are relevant to the present work and have similar atom - atom correlations on the dissociation sphere and on the @xmath1-wave scattering halo , respectively @xcite .",
    "all the experiments described above generate quantum correlations that can not be described by gross - pitaevskii mean - field theory .",
    "they provide a challenge for theorists to develop and apply more advanced techniques in order to quantitatively model experimental systems , such as used in refs .",

    "particular interest in molecular dissociation experiments stems from the prospect of generating and detecting squeezed states of matter waves kasevich , moelmer2001,roberts , twinbeams , yurovski - diss , haine , savagekheruntsyanspatial , with potential applications in precision measurements .",
    "there also exists the possibility of producing einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations and other entangled states of massive particles meystre - spin - epr , duan - spin - epr , soerensen - duan - zoller , yurovski - fwm , kprl , hope , olsen - davis , zhao - astrakharchik for fundamental tests of quantum theory in mesoscopic regimes and for quantum information science applications .",
    "additionally , molecular dissociation can serve as a probe of two - body interactions , collisional resonances , and spectroscopic properties of feshbach resonance molecules wieman - julienne - dissociation , rempe - kokkelmans - dissociation , braaten-2006,hanna-2006 .",
    "other recent studies of dissociation are concerned with the role of confinement on the stability of a molecular bec against dissociation vardi , the effect of magnetic field fluctuations on dissociation plata-2005 , and the dynamics of molecule - atom conversion in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a pairing mean - field theory ( pmft ) to the dynamics of dissociation of a bec of molecular dimers consisting of pairs of either bosonic or fermionic atoms .",
    "the mean fields for the molecules are introduced in the standard way at the level of amplitudes , whereas for the atoms they are introduced at the level of pairing fields @xcite that describe normal and anomalous moments of the atomic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this approach takes into account the molecular depletion and can facilitate the calculation of atom - atom pair correlation functions beyond the coherent level of the simple mean field theory .",
    "the present pmft is similar to that of jack and pu @xcite , except that : ( _ i _ ) we extend the analysis to one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems ; ( _ ii _ ) we relax the approximation of the constant density of atomic states around the peak dissociation energy ; and ( _ iii _ ) we calculate the pair correlation functions for dissociated atoms .",
    "first - principle quantum simulations of the dissociation of molecular becs into bosonic atoms have been performed using the stochastic positive-@xmath0 representation method @xcite , however this technique has some limitations .",
    "most significant is the short time scale over which the positive-@xmath0 method remains valid and produces results free of large sampling errors or the boundary term problem @xcite .",
    "for pure dissociation , without @xmath1-wave scattering interactions , the typical timescale for the positive-@xmath0 simulations is limited to about @xmath2 conversion @xcite .",
    "the addition of @xmath1-wave scattering interactions further limits this to even shorter durations and only @xmath3 conversion for typical experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear in the fermionic case ; even though similar first - principle techniques for simulating multi - mode fermion dynamics have recently been developed @xcite , these techniques have not been applied yet to the problem of multi - mode dissociation for quantitative comparison .",
    "given the limitations of exact techniques , it is useful to develop alternative , approximate theoretical techniques that can deal with longer durations of dissociation and larger conversion percentage .",
    "the pmft developed here and in ref .",
    "@xcite falls into this category and goes beyond previous approximate theories that ignore molecular depletion altogether @xcite .",
    "as such , the range of its validity with respect to molecular depletion covers dissociation durations corresponding to near complete conversion .",
    "in addition , the pmft is able to treat the dissociation into bosonic and fermionic atoms on equal footing and therefore is closer to being able to quantitatively describe the experiments on dissociation of @xmath4k@xmath5 dimers into fermionic atoms @xcite , in addition to the earlier experiments on dissociation of @xmath6na@xmath5 @xcite and @xmath7rb@xmath5 @xcite dimers into bosonic atoms .",

    "after _ the feshbach sweep or the raman transitions ( corresponding to @xmath58 is the actual initial condition for our simulations .    for a molecule at rest , the excess of potential energy @xmath59 ( which we also refer to as the dissociation energy ) is converted into kinetic energy @xmath60 of atom pairs with equal but opposite momenta @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "this is the physical origin of the expected correlations between the atoms , which we will study below in the context of many - body field theory .",
    "the main limitation of our treatment is that we consider a spatially uniform system in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the question that one has to address then is how well the results of a uniform model can describe realistic nonuniform systems .",
    "it has previously been shown @xcite that while the uniform treatment can give quantitatively reasonable results for the total number of atoms and the atomic density distribution ( provided the uniform system is appropriately size - matched to a nonuniform system , as in sec .",
    "[ sect : total - n ] ) , such a treatment is not adequate for giving correct quantitative results for density - density correlation functions .",
    "the reason is the mode - mixing due to inhomogeneity of trapped condensates , which can strongly degrade the correlations compared to the predictions of the uniform model @xcite . nevertheless , the merit of calculating the correlation functions here is that the results provide upper bounds for the correlations fermidiss , savage and hence aid qualitative understanding .",
    "another obvious consideration when applying the uniform results to size - matched nonuniform systems is that the duration of dissociation should not exceed the time required for the atoms to propagate distances larger than the size of the uniform box @xmath63 .",
    "thus the results are valid for times @xmath64where @xmath65 is the mean velocity of the dissociated atoms . in other words , while our numerical results can be formally obtained for arbitrarily long times , the above equation should be used to cutoff these results at @xmath66 when they are applied to a specific nonuniform system of size @xmath63 .",
    "the next major assumption in our treatment is the mean - field coherent state for molecules at all times @xcite .",
    "this approximation breaks down once the dissociation approaches the regime of complete depletion of the molecular condensate ( @xmath67 conversion ) when quantum fluctuations become increasingly important .",
    "accordingly , the results of the mean field theory can not be trusted past that point in time ; we present these results only for academic purposes .",
    "we note that nearly complete conversion in the mean field theory would always take place in the case of bosonic atoms , but not necessarily in the fermionic case where the pauli exclusion principle for the atoms can dominate the molecular depletion .",
    "in this situation the fermionic results can prove to be reliable for longer durations than in the bosonic case .",
    "finally , we do not include any @xmath1-wave scattering interaction terms .",
    "potentially these interactions can affect the atom - atom correlations in realistic nonuniform systems , especially in the long time limit .",
    "however , their effect is negligible at low particle densities and short dissociation times @xcite . at the level of mean fields",
    ", the @xmath1-wave scattering terms can be neglected if the dissociation energy is much larger than the mean - field interaction energy .",
    "more importantly , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the strongest degradation of atom - atom correlations in realistic systems ( compared to the predictions of uniform models ) comes not from the @xmath1wave scattering interactions , but from the mode - mixing due to inhomogeneity .",
    "accordingly , any theory that attempts to give quantitatively correct results for atom - atom correlations has to first address the question of inhomogeneity before including @xmath1-wave interactions .",
    "the pairing mean field theory developed here does not have this goal , but only represents an intermediate step between the simple analytic theory of undepleted molecules @xcite and a more complete theory that can reliably treat mode - mixing due to inhomogeneity and @xmath1-wave scattering interactions for both bosonic and fermionic atoms .",
    "before presenting our numerical results within the framework of the pmft , we discuss the simpler results that follow from a fermi s golden rule calculation of the molecular decay rate .",
    "due to the conservation of the total number of atomic particles , the molecular decay rate can be converted into the rate of atom production and serve as the simplest description of the dynamics of dissociation in the initial spontaneous regime . in particular , fermi s golden rule gives the correct initial behavior of the total atom number as a function of time since at this stage neither bosonic stimulation nor pauli blocking affects the dynamics of individual modes .",
    "it also provides simple and useful insights into the differences associated with the dimensionality of the system , which are not explicit in the numerical results .",
    "the derivation presented here is a direct calculation based on the actual many - body hamiltonian rather than an estimate based on the comparison of the mean - field energy shift and the energy shift of a feshbach resonance state as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "according to fermi s golden rule , the molecular decay rate @xmath68 is given by @xcite@xmath69where @xmath70 is the density of two - atom states , @xmath71 is the total kinetic energy of two atoms corresponding to the total dissociation energy @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the transition matrix element for the atom - molecule coupling channel . calculating @xmath73 explicitly from the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) ( see appendix [ sect : appendix - a ] for details ) , we obtain the following results in 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensions:@xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant .",

    ", @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the total initial number of molecules with no atoms present .",
    "thus , the solution @xmath79 to the rate equation for the molecular decay , can be rewritten as @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "noting also that @xmath81 since @xmath82 is conserved , the final result for the total number of atoms in each spin state takes the following simple form:@xmath83we see immediately that the atom production rate in 1d , 2d and 3d increases , remains unchanged and decreases , respectively , with the dissociation energy @xmath84 , following the respective dependence of the decay rate @xmath85 on the detuning @xmath86 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the different dependence of the density of atomic states @xmath87 on energy @xmath88 in 1d , 2d and 3d .",
    "the decay rate @xmath68 derived above is for dissociation into _ distinguishable _ atoms . for completeness",
    ", we now present the derivation in the case of _ indistinguishable _ ( bosonic ) atoms and show that the resulting expression in 3d coincides with the expression given in ref .",
    "the reasons for presenting these details are two - fold .",
    "first , we would like to point out that even though the present paper is primarily concerned with dissociation into distinguishable atom pairs ( either fermions or bosons in different spin states ) , the results in the bosonic case can be easily modified to describe the case of indistinguishable atoms in the same spin state .",
    "secondly , we would like to spell out the connection of the microscopic feshbach parameters with the coupling constant @xmath21 in the respective field - theory hamiltonians without leaving room for confusion about factors of two .",
    "the details of derivation of the decay rate @xmath89 in the present case are given in appendix [ sect : appendix - b ] ; the final result is:@xmath90 for the same coupling strength @xmath19 these rates appear to be simply half the corresponding result for the distinguishable case , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "however , one has to take into account that the interaction hamiltonian for the present indistinguishable case has an extra factor of @xmath91 in front of @xmath19 and that the definition of @xmath19 in the two cases are different .",
    "the total number of atoms produced during the initial stage of dissociation ( @xmath92 ) is @xmath93comparing this with the result of eq .",
    "( [ atom - number ] ) we see that for the same coupling constant @xmath19 in the hamiltonians  ( hindistinguish ) and ( [ eq : ham ] ) , the total number of atoms produced in the indistinguishable case corresponds to the number of atoms in _ each _ spin state produced in the distinguishable case .",
    "considering a uniform system in a cubic box of volume @xmath94 @xmath95 ( or a square of area @xmath96 in 2d , or a line of length @xmath63 in 1d ) , we expand the molecular and atomic field operators in terms of plane - wave modes@xmath97where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) are the corresponding creation operators satisfying the usual bosonic commutation relation for molecules @xmath101=\\delta _ { \\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime } } $ ] and fermionic anti - commutation or bosonic commutation relations for the atoms , @xmath102 or @xmath103=\\delta _ { \\mathbf{k}% , \\mathbf{k}^{\\prime } } \\delta _ { i , j}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath104 is the momentum in wave - number units , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) in the 3d case , with similar relations in the 1d and 2d cases .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , can now be written as @xmath108    to proceed , we next assume that the initial condition is a large molecular condensate in the mode @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) and that the dynamics of dissociation retains the molecular population in the same condensate mode @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that we ignore any atom - atom recombination process in which two atoms with non - opposite momenta @xmath112 and @xmath113 combine to populate a non - condensate molecular mode @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation at least during the initial stages of dissociation when recombination is negligible .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( [ h - kq ] ) now reduces to @xmath116where we have introduced @xmath117 and a new coupling constant@xmath118we note that the hamiltonian ( [ h - k ] ) conserves the total number of atomic particles , @xmath119 , and the number difference , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 ( @xmath100 ) are the particle number operators for the atoms .",
    "the next step in the mean - field approach is to assume that the molecular condensate is initially in a coherent state with an amplitude @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) , and that it remains in a coherent state during the dynamical evolution .",
    "the condensate dynamics are then treated at the level of the mean - field amplitude , @xmath124 , which implies that we can approximate the higher - order correlation function @xmath125 .",
