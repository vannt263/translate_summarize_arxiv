    "spectroscopy in the mid- to far - infrared is emerging as a critical tool for understanding the physical properties of galaxies , and is the missing link in the new era of very large multi - wavelength spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "this spectral region is dominated by emission from interstellar gas and dust , largely powered by active star formation .",
    "observation of this reprocessed starlight enables measurement of embedded star formation that is inaccessible to ultraviolet ( uv ) or optical diagnostics .",
    "spectroscopy in the infrared ( ir ) also directly probes the makeup and physical state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) through the shape of the thermal continuum , aromatic molecular bands and a wealth of emission lines .",
    "the improved understanding of star formation on a galactic scale granted by ir spectroscopy is increasingly important as we strive to understand the evolution of cosmic star formation , and in particular its decline since z@xmath11 .",
    "while ir spectroscopy has enabled substantial progress in mapping the most intensely star - forming ( sf ) galaxies in the local universe , these galaxies are not the principal stellar factories of the current epoch , nor are they the closest analogs to the dominant sources of star - formation at its cosmic peak .    at z@xmath11 ,",
    "luminous infrared as well as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) appear to dominate star - forming activity @xcite , in stark contrast to the local universe where lower - luminosity normal galaxies contribute the bulk of current star formation .",
    "however a number of independent studies @xcite show that these z@xmath11 lirgs and ulirgs do not display the signs of violent interactions observed in their local counterparts .",
    "in fact , it appears that over much of cosmic history the bulk of stars were formed in galaxies dynamically similar to normal , disk - dominated galaxies at low redshift .",
    "thus , low - redshift disk galaxies are important laboratories of cosmic star formation  both in their own right and as dynamical analogs of higher redshift lirgs and ulirgs . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite has enabled dramatic strides in our understanding of this galaxy population @xcite , and galex observations of the sdss sample has provided a powerful additional lever arm for understanding  and selecting for  the star formation properties of these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "mid - ir ( mir ) to far - ir ( fir ) spectroscopy is now the key missing ingredient .",
    "its addition to the galex and sdss data allows a thorough accounting of star formation , opens up a wealth of new diagnostics , and grants the potential to self - consistently treat stellar populations and dust absorption and emission in models ( e.g. da cunha , charlot , & elbaz 2008 ) .",
    "a sample of star - forming galaxies spanning a representative range of physical properties with comprehensive multiwavelength coverage from the far - uv ( fuv ) to the fir is necessary .",
    "the _ spitzer - sdss - galex spectroscopy survey _ ( ssgss ) provides such a sample . selecting from the low - extinction lockman hole within the sloan+galex footprint , fuv and optical diagnostics",
    "are used to define a broad , representative sample of 100 normal , star - forming galaxies between redshifts 0 and 0.2 , boasting rich , multi - wavelength coverage .",
    "deep _ spitzer _",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy has been obtained for the entire sample , and high - resolution spectroscopy for the brightest 33 galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we describe the ssgss dataset . in section  [ motivation ]",
    "we outline the scientific motivation and goals of the survey , in section  [ sample ] we describe the sample selection and properties , in section  [ observations ] we detail the observations , in section  [ reduction ] we describe the data reduction and quality assessment , in section  [ data ] we present the spectra and compare to the ir spectra of starburst galaxies , and in section  [ products ] we describe the ssgss data products .",
    "the primary goal of ssgss is , broadly , the detailed characterization of the ir spectra of normal , star - forming galaxies spanning a comprehensive range of physical properties . through comparison with multi - wavelength data from the fuv to the fir , ssgss seeks to disentangle the physical processes responsible for the wide range of emission features observed in galaxies ir spectra , and so to calibrate these features as diagnostics of galaxies physical states .",
    "interstellar dust absorbs from 50% to as much as 90% of the uv and optical starlight in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; wang & heckman 1996 ; buat et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ; bell & kennicutt 2001 ; calzetti 2001 ; goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the re - radiated ir photons consitute half of the bolometric luminosity in the local universe .",
    "broad - band measures of the ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies have taken us a long way towards understanding the link between this emission and star formation ; first with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and subsequently with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    ", with deep imaging surveys tracing obscured star formation in lirgs , ulirgs and `` normal '' disk systems out to redshift 3 and beyond ( e.g. perez - gonzalez et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however several processes complicate the interpretation of broad - band measurements in the ir : the thermal ir continuum depends on both the temperature distribution and composition of the dust ; aromatic bands in the mir are linked to star formation , dust composition , and agn activity , but are poorly understood ; atomic and molecular lines span a wide range of ionizations and hence arise from a wide variety of environments ; agn and stellar emission compete with thermal dust emission in the continuum ; and all of these may be affected by extinction ( although more weakly than in optical and uv bands . ) to begin to deconvolve the effects of these processes , and hence to unlock the diagnostic power of the ir spectrum of galaxies , high quality spectroscopy is necessary .",
    "the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) has enabled great strides in this regard , especially for very luminous ir sources .",
    "we now have detailed mir spectroscopic libraries of the most actively star - forming galaxies , both in the local universe ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , and , increasingly , at higher redshifts ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; @xcite ) has been especially important in linking the primary components of the mir spectrum with physical properties , including : linking the effects of metallicity , ionizing field , star - formation , and h@xmath2 intensity with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features @xcite , physical modeling and characterization of dust content @xcite , and diagnosing abundances and the relative contributions of star formation versus agn activity @xcite . with its local sample , one of the strengths of sings is its capacity for spatial resolution within its galaxies .",
    "this has enabled , for example , the mapping of the radial distributions of dust , gas , stars , and their evolution @xcite and the use of h@xmath3 attenuation as a tracer of obscured star - formation @xcite .",
    "these results have provided a powerful insight into the inner workings of galaxies , however it is challenging to draw general conclusions on the global properties of the sings sample due to its focus on the nuclear regions of these extended sources .",
    "in addition , sings is typical of other irs samples , in that it is dominated by ir luminous galaxies . to characterize the ir spectra of a representative population of star - forming galaxies , we need increased depth , a greater redshift range , and more careful selection criteria .",
    "ssgss spectroscopy spans the 540  range , covering a wealth of diagnostic features .",
    "these include : prominent emission bands from pah molecules , a continuum fueled by reprocessed as well as direct starlight and by agn , and abundant emission lines revealing a very wide range of ionization states .",
    "each of these features promises significant diagnostic potential .",
    "pah molecules produce a convoluted spectrum of broad features and complexes that dominate the mir below 20  .",
    "these arise from multiple vibrational modes of aromatic carbon lattices with a wide range of grain sizes and ionization fractions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the ssgss spectra span the full complement of major pah bands from 6.2  to 17  , and include features arising from carbon - carbon stretching , and carbon - hydrogen in - plane and out - of - plane bending modes .",
    "the strengths of these pah bands , relative to both the continuum and to each other , have the potential to serve as powerful diagnostics of the environments of these molecules .",
    "examples of physical properties probed by pah spectra include :    _ star formation history : _ the overall luminosity radiated in the pah bands is directly linked to the star formation rate ( sfr ; e.g. @xcite ) , and may be an important proxy at higher redshifts where pah features fall in mir bands . as the pah spectrum varies depending on star formation history and other properties",
    ", its diagnostic potential depends on a suite of templates measured at low - redshift and calibrated to a range of properties more robustly measurable at high redshift .",
    "_ pah grain size : _ grain size distribution affects the relative strength of short - to - long wavelenth pah bands .",
    "larger pah molecules tend to emit more efficiently at longer wavelengths than do smaller grains @xcite and so pah ratios can be used as an indicator of grain size distribution .",
    "this in turn is an indicator of both the growth and destruction of pah molecules , and so will gauge the likely governing parameters , such as abundance , star formation , and agn activity .",
    "_ pah ionization : _ ionized pah molecules radiate via carbon - carbon ( cc ) stretching modes with significantly greater efficiency that do neutral pah molecules , while carbon - hydrogen ( ch ) modes do not show the same dependence @xcite",
    ". the ratios of bands arising from cc modes , such as those centered at 6.2  and 7.7  , to ch bands , such as the prominant 11.3  feature , provide a sensitive indicator of pah ionization fraction , and so probe the fuv photon flux and the temperature distribution of the pah grains .",
    "as indicated by the models of @xcite , a combined suite of pah ratios can be used to disentangle the effects of grain size distribution and ionized fraction .      combined with mips 70  and 160  flux ,",
    "the ssgss spectra enable the most comprehensive characterization of dust temperature distributions in normal galaxies to date .",
    "while the 60  /100  flux ratio has been shown to be a good diagnostic of the general shape of the ir spectrum @xcite , and hence of dust temperature , the mir continuum can exhibit a range of shapes beyond its slope .",
    "these variations are likely due to variations in the grain size and composition of the warm dust component , as well as any agn component . coupled with the uv / optical dust attenuation curves , spectral shapes to 40  grant insight into these grain properties in galaxies with no significant agn component .",
    "comparison of continuum shapes with optical diagnostics of star formation and metallicity will be important in disentangling these competing effects .",
    "furthermore , short wavelength spectra allow a better determination of the contribution of thermal and stellar emission in galaxies over the wavelength range from 5  to 10  , where dust is expected to fully dominate the mir spectrum .",
    "ssgss s mir spectra and fir photometry allow for a detailed understanding of dust emission in these galaxies , and so provide a thorough account of reprocessed starlight .",
    "the multi - wavelength nature of this sample is important here ; optical diagnostics such as the @xmath4 emission line and the 4000  break , as well as uv photometry , give independent measures of star formation that may be used to study the efficiency of reprocessing .",
    "this is important for the use of ir photometry as a measure of star formation , and also to help understand the fate of galaxies ionizing radiation .",
    "galex data is especially helpful here : the comparison of lyman-@xmath3 emission in the fuv band to the mir  fir intensity and slope allows us to investigate the fate of fuv photons , and hence escape fraction , as a function of galaxy type ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "mir line ratios provide valuable diagnostics of hii regions .",
    "electron densities can be studied using s iii]@xmath5/[s iii]@xmath6 and [ ne  iii]@xmath7/[ne  iii]@xmath8 , while ionization ratios can be studied using [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] , [ s iv]/[s iii ] and [ ar iii]/[ar ii ] , and elemental abundances using various optical and mir line species .",
    "many high stellar mass galaxies ( log  @xmath9 ) in the local universe and at z=1 possess composite optical emission - line spectra showing evidence of excitation by both young stars and agn .",
    "these signatures are degenerate and are necessarily incomplete in characterizing reddened agn .",
    "mir ionization indicators such as [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] are invaluable for decomposing star formation and agn emission because of the minimal levels of attenuation seen at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "comparison of these with other agn indicators , such as uv / optical line ratios @xcite , and even pah equivalent widths ( ews ) , allow us to analyse the diagnostic power of all of these measures . combined with detailed mir spectra",
    ", we can investigate the relative effects of agn - sourced and starburst - sourced hard radiation fields on the ism .",
    "the abundance and composition of raw materials probably has a significant effect on the build - up and behaviour of dust grains . to better understand this effect , mir abundance indicators combined with optical measures of gas - phase metallicity @xcite",
    "can be compared with pah bands , thermal dust continuum emission , and with mir silicate absorption .",
    "the molecular hydrogen ir fluorescence spectrum provides an indication of the physical conditions in photo - dissociation regions around molecular clouds and , while linked to the fuv radiation field , may also be produced by shocks in these regions .",
    "the ssgss sample consists of 100 star - forming galaxies observed with _ spitzer _",
    "irs in the lockman hole region , and is selected to have ancillary multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopy from the fuv to the fir , and to include galaxies with sfrs spanning the full range observed in the normal , star - forming population , short of the most extreme starbursting sources .      the lockman hole , situated around @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is a @xmath110 square degree field with one of the lowest column densities of interstellar material in the milky way , with @xmath12 , approximately 5% of the galactic median .",
    "this makes it ideal for low - surface brightness surveys , and so it has been the subject of extensive multi - wavelength surveys .",
    "these include deep rosat imaging , deep galex ( m@xmath13  24.5 ab ) , sdss imaging ( m@xmath14 ab ) and spectroscopy , deep 2mass ( @xmath15 , m@xmath1617.8 ab , @xcite ) and spitzer / swire @xcite irac ( m @xmath122.5 , 20 for 3.6 , 8.0  ) surveys , as well as future programs ( e.g. ukidss deep survey over the full region ) . the sdss primary spectroscopic sample targets all galaxies with @xmath17 and yields @xmath18 galaxies deg@xmath19 .          the lockman hole sample of @xcite forms the parent sample for ssgss , and consists of 916 galaxies at @xmath0 with galex - sdss - spitzer / swire all - band coverage .",
    "the wide spectral coverage of this sample  from fuv to fir  allows a consistent treatment of dust absorption and the corresponding dust emission , providing a total accounting of the star formation , stellar mass , and dust attenuation for these galaxies . a detailed description of these and other derived measurements and physical parameters can be found in section  [ cproducts ] .",
    "ssgss targets a subset of this lockman hole sample for observation with the _ spitzer _ irs .",
    "these galaxies are selected based on two brightness criteria :    * * 5.8  surface brightness : * galaxies fill the irs short - low slit , and so at short - wavelengths we apply a surface brightness limit of i@xmath20  mjy  sr@xmath19 , based on irac 5.8   flux and half - light diameter ( the median / mean half - light diameter is 5  for the entire sample ) . * * 24   flux : * at long wavelengths most of the galaxies are unresolved , and so a flux limit of f@xmath21  mjy is applied .",
    "the above criteria yield 154 galaxies .",
    "we further restrict the sample by performing an even sampling of the planes of near - uv ( nuv)-3.6  vs. stellar mass ( from @xcite ) and nuv-3.6  vs. @xmath22 ; in the dense regions of these spaces , we select the galaxy with the highest 24  flux .",
    "this process ensures that the sample spans a comprehensive range of physical properties .",
    "figure  [ nuv-3.6 ] shows the distributions of nuv-3.6  color versus stellar mass and @xmath22 for the ssgss galaxies compared to the lockman hole sample , and illustrates that the two span a similar range of galaxy properties .",
    "the lockman hole sample itself is representative of the sdss galaxy sample with galex fuv detections ; that is to say , normal , star - forming galaxies , consisting of both early- and late - type , s with @xmath23 .",
    "the sample observed with spitzer consists of 101 galaxies . due to a fault with the sl spectrum for ssgss 40 ,",
    "the current ssgss data release consists of 100 galaxies .",
    "we preserve theoriginal indexing for consistency .    within the ssgss sample , we designate the _ bright sample _ and the _ faint sample _",
    ", with the bright sample consisting of the 33 galaxies with f@xmath24  mjy .",
    "the entire sample is the subject of low - resolution 5  40  irs spectroscopy , while the bright sample is also observed with 10 - 20  high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "this final ssgss sample has a redshift range of @xmath25 with median redshift 0.085 , and a total infrared luminosity ( @xmath26 ) range of @xmath27 , with median @xmath28 .",
    "the bright sample has redshift range of @xmath29 with median redshift 0.077 , and an @xmath26 range of @xmath30 with median @xmath31 .",
    "the flux and surface brightness cuts do eliminate galaxies with very low stellar masses ( @xmath32 ) , metallicities ( @xmath33 ) , and extinctions ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "for @xmath22 and h@xmath3  ew , the residual is @xmath120% even including galaxies with agn components , indicating that these age diagnostics are good predictors of mass - weighted pah intensity for most galaxies .",
    "this emphasizes that the increased scatter seen in @xmath68 and @xmath26 versus sfr in evolved populations is due to inaccuracy in measuring sfr rather than , say , a blurring due to evolved stars contributing more significantly to dust heating .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the correlation between pah emission and metallicity leads to another source of increased uncertainty in the link between star formation and ir dust emission in evolved sources .",
    "total ir luminosity is also closely related to these sf diagnostics , and has a very similar slope and scatter as @xmath68 , for all three parameters and for both the absolute and mass - weighted relations . for the purpose of modeling high - z and photometric seds , it is useful to understand how the pah - to - total ir ratio changes with these properties",

    "it is not possible to extricate the effects of age and agn status on @xmath80 from these data , although as shown in od09 both seem to play a part .",
    "more specifically , short wavelength pah features ( 6.2  and 7.7  ) are diminished in more evolved galaxies and agn , while longer wavelength features are not .",
    "this is seen in the pah ratios ( od09 ) and with respect to @xmath26 ( t10 ) .",
    "the trend is between @xmath80 and star formation is still weakly significant for sf galaxies alone , with agn excluded , although this is entirely driven by a small number of heavily star - forming sources with very high @xmath80 .",
    "the ssgss ir spectra , with its coverage of all major pah features , combined with mips 70  and 160  photometry , enables us to fit detailed dust models to determine dust mass .",
    "we use the models of @xcite , which calculate ir emission spectra for starlight - heated dust consisting of amorphous silicate and graphite grains , and of pah grains .",
    "ssgss spectra and photometry are fit to template libraries derived from these models ( draine & li , private communication ) to estimate the distribution of illuminating starlight intensity and the relative abundance of pah .",
    "these are combined with mips fluxes and the relations detailed in @xcite to determine the total dust mass .",
    "based on these models , the median dust mass for the sample is @xmath81  m@xmath82 , with 90% of the sample in the range @xmath83@xmath84  m@xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ dustmasssfr ] ( left ) shows the calculated dust masses for the ssgss sample versus sfr@xmath85 , with colour coding to indicate agn type by bpt designation .",
    "also plotted are the results of @xcite ( d10 ) , who fit the galex - sdss-2mass-_iras _ photometry of sdss and sings galaxies with seds derived from population synthesis and dust attenuation models @xcite to calculate both dust mass and sfr .",
    "ssgss dust masses are very similar to the d10 sdss sample .",
    "the sings dust masses are roughly consistent with the range of dust masses calculated using the @xcite models for a sub - sample of sings galaxies ( @xcite ) , which reinforces the comparibility of the two models .",

    "the best - fit regression line is :    @xmath87    we note that d10 find a tighter relation between these two parameters for sdss galaxies .",
    "this may indicate a more accurate sfr estimation by d10 over the optical emission line estimate , due to their use of the full fuv - to - fir sed .",
    "figure  [ dustmasssfr ] ( middle ) shows dust - to - stellar mass fraction versus ssfr for ssgss , again including the results of d10 .",
    "there is a significant positive correlation between dust fraction and ssfr ( @xmath88 ; correlation significance : @xmath89 ) , although here there is significantly more scatter than observed by d10 in their sample .",
    "the best - fit regression line is :    @xmath90    figure  [ dustmasssfr ] ( right ) shows the ratio of dust mass to sfr , which , given the tight correlation between sfr and gas mass , may be considered a proxy for the dust - to - gas mass ratio , and so traces the enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "the ssgss results follow the general trend of the d10 sample , ( @xmath91 ; correlation significance : @xmath92 ) , however the careful sample selection of ssgss means that it contains fewer of the rare , extreme sf galaxies , and the uv selection eliminates the oldest red , dead galaxies ; the result is a more restricted range of ssfr that makes it difficult to verify the slope of this relation .    these strong correlations between galaxys dust content and star formation rate  and especially between their absolute values  supports the idea that sfr provides a useful proxy for dust mass , as found by d10 .",
    "the careful sample selection of ssgss adds weight to this result .",
    "as noted by d10 , these relations can be interpreted in evolutionary terms .",
    "the ism is enriched by dust with ongoing star formation , and at the same time gas mass decreases , resulting in a drop in sfr . with this drop",
    ", the production of dust is quickly superseded by destruction of grains in the ism , resulting in the positive correlation between dust fraction and ssfr ( fig .",
    "[ dustmasssfr ] , middle ) . at the same time , this reduction in dust content with galaxy age appears to be outpaced by the reduction in gas content and the associated drop in ssfr , resulting in the anticorrelation between dust - to - gas mass ratio vs. ssfr ( fig .",
    "[ dustmasssfr ] , right ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "the balance between ism enrichment and the destruction of dust by shocks and by the ambient radiation field defines the direction and slope of these relations .",
    "the bpt emission line ratios , [ oiii]/h@xmath93 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 , are sensitive to the hardness of the ambient radiation field and the level of ism enrichment respectively , and so may shed light on the nature of this balance . additionally , as seen in figure  [ dustmasssfr ] ,",
    "galaxies with bpt - designated agn components have lower dust fractions than sf galaxies .",
    "although this may be purely due to the increased incidence ( and observability ) of agn in older galaxies , the difference in dust fraction with ssfr seems to be divided surprisingly cleanly down agn lines .",
    "it is possible that agn shocks and hard uv photons are important in destroying small dust grains , given their potential affect on pah grain size distributions ( @xcite ; od09 ; t10 )    figure  [ dustmassbpt ] ( upper panels ) shows dust - to - stellar mass fraction versus [ oiii]/h@xmath93 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 , as well as the distribution of dust fractions by bpt designation .",
    "both ratios show a scattered but significant inverse correlation , and in both cases there is no significant trend taking either sf galaxies or agn separately .",
    "[ oiii]/h@xmath93 provides a good proxy for the hardness of the uv radiation field , and so it is tempting to link dust grain destruction with an increase in hard uv photons , although it is not possible to extricate this effect from the drop in dust production with diminishing star formation .",
    "notably , sf galaxies with hard uv fields ( [ oiii]/h@xmath94 0.5 ) all have have significantly higher dust fractions than agn with similar [ oiii]/h@xmath93 . these same galaxies have among the highest ssfrs , implying that either the radiation field has little to do with grain destruction , or that dust production due to heavy star formation in these galaxies more than compensates for such depletion .",
    "[ nii]/h@xmath3 is sensitive to gas - phase metallicity , and so may be expected to have a positive correlation with dust - to - stellar mass fraction .",
    "the observed negative correlation supports the idea that the drop in dust content of these galaxies ( @xmath95 ) outpaces the increase in the gas - phase metallicity ( and corresponding dust - to - gas mass fraction ) as these galaxies evolve .",
    "figure  [ dustmassbpt ] ( lower panels ) shows the ratio of dust mass to sfr vs. bpt line ratios .",
    "there is no correlation between this and any of the line ratios , and no trend with agn status .",
    "this is expected ; while dust - to - stellar mass fraction decreases with stellar population age , gas content and the associated sfr probably decreases more quickly , eliminating any trend .",

    "<S> the spitzer sdss galex spectroscopic survey ( ssgss ) provides a new sample of 101 star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 with unprecedented multi - wavelength coverage . </S>",
    "<S> new mid- to far - infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope is added to a rich suite of previous imaging and spectroscopy , including rosat , galex , sdss , 2mass , and _ spitzer_/swire . </S>",
    "<S> sample selection ensures an even coverage of the full range of normal galaxy properties , spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass , colour , and dust attenuation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the ssgss data set , describe the science drivers , and detail the sample selection , observations , data reduction , and quality assessment . </S>",
    "<S> also in this paper , we compare the shape of the thermal continuum and the degree of silicate absorption of these typical , star - forming galaxies to those of starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the link between star formation rate , infrared luminosity , and total pah luminosity , with a view to calibrating the latter for sed models in photometric samples and at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we take advantage of the 5 - 40  spectroscopic and far infrared photometric coverage of this sample to perform detailed fitting of the @xcite dust models , and investigate the link between dust mass and star formation history and agn properties .    </S>",
