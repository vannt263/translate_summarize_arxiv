    "the problem of light scattering by particles of one medium embedded in another has a long history , dating back almost a century to the classical exact solution due to mie  @xcite .",

    "an alternative strategy useful in the long wavelength limit is the so - called rayleigh - gans ( r - g ) approximation @xcite , which is closely allied to the classic born approximation of quantum mechanics .",

    "this is equivalent to examining light scattering by a composite particle consisting of the central core plus a surrounding liquid crystalline layer .",
    "the analysis of a mie  type theory uses a systematic expansion of the electromagnetic field over vector spherical harmonics .",

    "t_matrix ansatz .",
    "this has been widely used in the related problem of light scattering by nonspherical particles  @xcite .    recently in  @xcite we have studied the scattering problem for the optical axis distributions of the form : @xmath0 . by using separation of variables and expansions over vector spherical harmonics ,",
