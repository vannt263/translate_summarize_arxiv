    "recently the formation of majorana fermions has been a central research problem in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "however , we believe that to address this problem a fundamental ingredient is lacking and the purpose of the present work is to introduce this missing piece and prove its importance .",
    "we thus introduce the generalized majorana polarization ( mp ) , which is a universal measure of the spatial dependence of the majorana of a given state , i.e. of the same - spin particle - hole overlap .",
    "this quantity can be thought of as the analog of the local density of states ( ldos ) for regular electrons , except for the fact that a real quantity does not suffice to capture the majorana character , and one needs to introduce a complex quantity which can be represented as a two - component vectorial quantity in the complex plane .",
    "it turns out that this quantity can be obtained from the particle - hole ( ph ) operator expectation value.such an operator @xmath0 , is anti - unitary , obeys @xmath1 , and anti - commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the majorana bound states ( mbs ) are self adjoint , i.e.  they are eigenstates of the ph operator with an eigenvalue of modulus 1 .",
    "it is therefore natural to use the mp which stems from the ph operator to analyze the mbs in more detail .",
    "note that the mp vector discussed here is a generalization of the mp introduced in ref .   which was applicable only for a specific subset of models.=0 $ ] and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition the former mp required specific spin densities . ]    having access to such a local measure can allow one to understand the evolution of these states through a phase transition , their dependence on specific particularities of the system such as size , disorder , inhomogeneities , etc .",
    ", as well as how one can manipulate them .",
    "the particular patterns arising in the spatial distribution of the mp vector , i.e spatially aligned ( ` ferromagnetic ' ) , vortex - like , localized - on - the - edges , etc , and its integral over given regions in space , allow one to assign a global topological character for any given state .    in what follows we write down the generalized mp definition and apply it to a few examples , such as two - dimensional @xmath4-wave kitaev arrays , and a topological one - dimensional wire in the presence of various inhomogeneities . as we will show",
    ", the spatial distribution of the mp vector , allows one to distinguish between states that exhibit a trivial or topological phase .",
    "when the criterion of a zero energy for a given state can not be strictly applied ( e.g infinitesimally small but non - zero energies ) , having a universal local order parameter is a sufficient and versatile criterion for such a distinction .",
    "this allows the accurate determination of the topological phase diagram from numerical calculations .",
    "also we find analytically the phase diagram for quasi 1d kitaev wires using an exact calculation of the topological invariant for these systems .",
    "the value of this topological invariant , and the corresponding phase diagrams were previously unknown .",
    "we compare the phase diagrams obtained using the two techniques and we note that the mp criterion works very accurately , even for not too large systems .",
    "thus , the mp is of potential use for the determination of the topology of more complicated realistic models , for which the direct determination of the topology using the topological invariant is unfeasible .",
    "moreover , as we will show , this criterion will help us prove the existence of quasi - majorana or precursor majorana states , which are locally but not globally majorana - like .",
    "such states exhibit locally an almost perfect electron - hole superposition , thus a quasi - maximal mp , however the direction of the mp vector may vary spatially and thus one can not isolate a well - defined region that would integrate to a fully localized majorana state .    in sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conc ] . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we present the analytical calculation of the topological invariant for the quasi-1d kitaev chains , while in appendix [ app_char ] we present the relation between the mp and the chiral character presented in ref .  .",
    "naturally all finite energy eigenstates of the hamiltonians under consideration satisfy @xmath5 and majorana states satisfy @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is the ph operator .",
    "additionally in a region @xmath7 where such a majorana state is localized it must satisfy @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projection onto site @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for a system",
    "with two majoranas localized each on a different edge of the system , @xmath7 can simply be taken to be half the system .",
    "one can therefore use the ph operator as a way of theoretically visualizing mbs ; this operator thus plays the role of a universal mp generalizing the picture introduced in ref .   which was valid only for a subset of hamiltonians ( the ` chiral orthogonal ' class , or bdi in the usual classification scheme@xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between the old definition and the current one is presented in section  [ oldmpdef ] .",
    "note that , while presenting some similarities , the general mp is different from the chiral majorana character introduced in ; they happen to take a similar form only for the particular case of the bdi systems , see app .",
    "[ app_char ] for more information .",
    "as the expectation values for an anti - unitary operator are not invariant under a change of global phase , it is fundamentally impossible to use the mp operator to compare different states , as we can do using the chiral majorana character introduced in ref .  .",

    "however , it has additional properties related to the fact that it can not be written for a d or diii topological superconductor ( ts ) .",
    "here we describe the relation between the mp and the previously defined chiral majorana character .    a spin - full state in the nambu basis , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 annihilates ( creates ) a particle of spin @xmath57 at site @xmath10 , can be described by the wavefunction @xmath131",
    ". we will write @xmath132 and define @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    in the most general case for a spinful bdi model",
    "the chiral majorana character is @xmath135+\\operatorname{e}^{-{\\textrm{i}}\\alpha}\\sin^2[\\beta/2]\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & - 2u_{j\\uparrow }   v^*_{j\\uparrow}\\left[\\operatorname{e}^{-{\\textrm{i}}\\alpha}\\cos^2[\\beta/2]+\\operatorname{e}^{{\\textrm{i}}\\alpha}\\sin^2[\\beta/2]\\right]\\\\\\nonumber & & + 2\\left ( u_{j\\uparrow }   v^*_{j\\downarrow}- u_{j\\downarrow }   v^*_{j\\uparrow}\\right){\\textrm{i}}\\sin[\\alpha]\\sin[\\beta]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angles @xmath71 and @xmath136 can be calculated from any two , non - parallel , spin vectors at different spatial points in the system . writing these as @xmath137 , then the angles are defined by@xcite @xmath138 as already noted the majorana states localized at the boundaries of the system have either @xmath139 or @xmath140 and these are well separated , much like the mp used here .",
    "this can be explicitly checked by plotting @xmath141 as a function of position for the eigenstates .",
    "an arbitrary but homogeneous superconducting phase of @xmath142 requires the transformation @xmath143 .    we know",
    "that for any majorana @xmath6 , and equally that @xmath144 it is then a simple task to construct a unitary operator which has this property also for a d or diii ts by allowing ourselves to locally correct for the operator using a spin rotation .",
    "the above spin - rotation can be understood as rotating the system to a reference frame in which @xmath145 , for a _",
    "particular _ state . by locally implementing such a rotation",
    ", it can be seen that any zero energy state will satisfy @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148=\\phi_{j\\delta}-\\theta_{j\\delta}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath149 are the local particle spin expectation values of the state @xmath150 .",
    "naturally such a definition no longer allows one to make any comparison across states or space . for a bdi system",
    "this transformation can be performed globally in an appropriately chosen spin basis .",
    "eq .   is referred to as the chiral density .",
    "note however that although all majorana states will have a chiral majorana density of one , not all states with a chiral density close to one must be majorana states , or even low energy localized states .",
    "the ph operator allows us to do better at identifying the majorana states by also defining the appropriate local phase for a state in a way which is independent of the spin basis used : @xmath151 this local phase is crucial to the arguments and calculations used in the main text .",
