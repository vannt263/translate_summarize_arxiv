    "piecewise smooth ( pws ) maps have received much research attention in the recent times because of their applicability in a large number of practical systems @xcite .",
    "this includes switching circuits @xcite , impact oscillators @xcite , a variety of micro and macro economic systems @xcite , cardiac dynamics @xcite and many other systems . for",
    "such maps a particular kind of bifurcation may occur , which is different from what can occur in smooth maps . as a control parameter changes ,",
    "the fixed point may move in the phase space and may collide with the borderline between two smooth regions , resulting in an abrupt jump of the floquet multipliers from the inside of the unit circle to the outside of it in the complex plane , leading to a special class of nonlinear phenomena known as border collision bifurcation ( bcb ) @xcite .",
    "the bcb consists of many atypical phenomena such as direct transition from a period-@xmath0 attractor to a chaotic attractor @xcite , multiple attractor bifurcation @xcite and dangerous bcb @xcite . recently in a series of papers @xcite a new type of bcb has been reported , where a stable fixed point changes into an unstable focus along with an attracting closed invariant curve .",
    "this closed invariant curve forms a torus associated with quasiperiodic or phase - locked periodic dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the torus breakdown route to chaos in pws invertible map has been characterized in @xcite which is distinct from that of afraimovich - shilnikov @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms of the creation and destruction of tori were studied in the context of two - dimensional smooth invertible maps @xcite and pws invertible maps @xcite .    in another line of work @xcite , the occurrence of chaos via",
    "torus destruction has been studied numerically and experimentally for non - invertible smooth maps .",
    "several routes to chaos were reported .",
    "the basic theory was proposed by maistrenko _",
    "_ @xcite and lorenz @xcite . in transition from a smooth invariant curve ( ic ) to a chaotic attractor",
    ", the process begins with the ic developing segments with increasingly high curvature . at a certain parameter value",
    "cusps develop on the ic , which subsequently change into loops . with further change of the parameter",
    ", the ic can be destroyed in accordance with scenarios analogous to those of the invertible case .",
    "after that the chaotic attractor comes into existence .",
    "cusps appear on ic when the degree of a map is greater than one and the ic intersects the critical curve so that the tangent of the ic at the point of intersection coincides with the eigenvector corresponding to zero eigenvalue or the critical curve contains cusp point ( a point on a curve at which tangents of each branch of the curve coincide ) .",
    "critical curve is the two dimensional extension of the local extrema ( critical point ) of a one dimensional differentiable map .",
    "it is the locus of all those points at which jacobian determinant vanishes . for a non - differentiable piecewise linear map like the tent map",
    ", the point of non - differentiability plays the role of critical point .",
    "but for a two dimensional piecewise smooth map , according to mira _",
    "@xcite the critical curve @xmath1 is the image of the borderline @xmath2 of the map and is characterized by the set of all points which have at least two coincident rank-@xmath0 preimages .",
    "this curve may contain more than one segment .",
    "it separates the phase plane into open regions where all points of a region have the same number of rank-@xmath0 preimages .",
    "the two dimensional pws normal form maps @xcite investigated so far are invertible . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the dynamical behavior of non - invertible pws maps . considering a general piecewise linear 2d map expressed in the normal form",
    ", we derive the parameter regions where the map is non - invertible .",
    "we illustrate how chaos appears in pws non - invertible maps and demonstrate the difference from the corresponding mechanisms of transition for smooth invertible @xcite and non - invertible maps @xcite .",
    "we investigate the bifurcation that takes place as one moves from the inside of a resonance tongue to the outside in the parameter space . inside a resonance tongue , a closed invariant curve is formed by the saddle - node connections of a pair of cycles ( a saddle and a node ) .",
    "this curve forms the mode - locked torus .",
    "we show that the cusp torus does not develop but the loop torus @xcite is created before the destruction of mode - locked torus as the parameter is varied continuously .",
    "the mode - locked torus is destroyed through a homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "we observe that the interaction between stable manifold and the critical curve leads to a qualitative change in the basin of attraction , from a simply connected to a nonconnected one .",
    "we also show that the unstable manifolds can have structurally stable self - intersections while the stable manifolds can intersect itself when the map becomes structurally unstable .",
    "there is a coexistence of stable node and a chaotic attractor .",
    "we show that the size of basin of attraction of the stable cycle ( node ) diminishes to zero and after this the stable node undergoes a border collision fold bifurcation .",
    "we also illustrate the important role played by non - invertibility of the map in the mechanism of transition to chaos .",
    "for a piecewise smooth map whose leading - order taylor term close to the border is linear , the dynamics in the neighborhood of the border can be expressed by a normal form map @xcite defined by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 @xmath5    the phase plane @xmath6 is divided into two compartments @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the trace and determinant respectively of the jacobian matrix @xmath11 in the left half - plane @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the trace and determinant respectively of the jacobian matrix @xmath15 in the right half - plane @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a parameter .",
    "thus @xmath18    most of the theories of bcb discussed so far are on dissipative dynamical systems ( i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "in contrast , we consider a situation where the map is contracting in the left side and expanding in the right side of the border , which happens when @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we choose @xmath23 satisfying the conditions @xmath24    = 2.8 in    the above conditions ensure that the fixed point for @xmath25 is attracting and for @xmath26 it is a spiral repellor .",
    "according to the notations in @xcite , we can write the stable fixed point by @xmath27 and unstable fixed point by @xmath28 in @xmath12 , and similarly by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively in @xmath16 . the fixed point in @xmath12 is @xmath31 and the fixed point in @xmath16 is @xmath32 @xmath27 or @xmath28 exists if @xmath33 , otherwise a virtual fixed point is located in @xmath16 and is denoted by @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",

    "the closed invariant curve is formed by the union of the unstable manifolds of a saddle cycle and the points of stable and saddle cycles .",
