    "investigation of the structure of hadrons , is a problem of considerable interest now .",
    "the inclusive reaction can be used to study ordinary parton distributions . however , it is difficult to distinguish events with a single outgoing proton or jet in a fixed target experiment like compass @xcite . in this case , at small @xmath3 the diffractive events will contribute together with nondiffractive one .",
    "the measured asymmetry can be written in the form @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it can be shown that the ratio @xmath7 should increase with @xmath8 .",
    "the integrated over @xmath3 @xmath7 ratio has been found at hera to be about 2030% @xcite .",
    "this means that diffractive events might be important in extraction of asymmetry at small @xmath3 from experiment .",
    "the diffractive hadron photoproduction can be expressed in terms of skewed parton distribution ( spd ) in the nucleon @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "investigation of such diffractive reactions should play a keystone role in future study @xmath10 at small @xmath3 . in the diffractive charm quark production including @xmath11 reactions , the predominant contribution is determined by the two - gluon exchange ( gluon spd ) .",
    "analysis of these reactions should throw light on the gluon structure of the proton at small @xmath3 @xcite .    to study spin effects in the diffractive hadron production",
    ", one must know the structure of the two - gluon coupling with the proton at small @xmath3 .",
    "the qcd  inspired diquark model generates the spin - dependent @xmath12 coupling @xcite of the following form : @xmath13 the first two terms of the vertex ( [ ver ] ) are symmetric over @xmath14 indices .",
    "the structure @xmath15 in ( [ ver ] ) determines the spin - non - flip contribution .",
    "the term @xmath16 leads to the transverse spin - flip in the vertex which does not vanish in the @xmath17 limit .",
    "the single spin transverse asymmetry predicted in the models @xcite is about 10% for @xmath18 which is of the same order of magnitude as has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "these model approaches give for the ratio @xmath19    the asymmetric structure in ( [ ver ] ) is proportional to @xmath20 and can be associated with @xmath21 .",
    "it should give a visible contribution to the double spin longitudinal asymmetry @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the value of this structure is not well known now from our model estimations .    in this report",
    ", we shall analyze spin effects caused by the structures @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it will be shown here that such effects will be small in the @xmath1 asymmetry . the double spin asymmetry for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized proton",
    "is predicted to be not small and mainly determined by the @xmath22 term in ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "such asymmetry should be used to study this structure in the @xmath12 coupling .",
    "let us study the diffractive @xmath11 production at high energies and fixed momentum transfer .",
    "the fractions of the momenta of proton carried by the pomeron , @xmath24 is small at high energies .",
    "the @xmath25 transition amplitude is described by a nonrelativistic wave function @xcite .",
    "gluons from the pomeron are coupled with the single and different quarks in the @xmath26 loop .",
    "the spin - average and spin dependent cross sections of the @xmath11 leptoproduction with parallel and antiparallel longitudinal polarization of a lepton and a proton are determined by the relation @xmath27 for the spin - average amplitude square we find @xcite @xmath28.\\ ] ] here the term proportional to @xmath29 represents the contribution of the virtual photon with transverse polarization .",
    "the @xmath30 term describes the effect of longitudinal photons .",
    "the @xmath31 factor in ( [ t+ ] ) is normalization , and the @xmath32 and @xmath33 functions are expressed through the integral over transverse momentum of the gluon .",

    "the @xmath32 function is determined by the similar integral .",
    "the spin - dependent amplitude square looks like @xmath36 m_j^2.\\ ] ]    the asymmetry @xmath37 depends on the ratio of the spin - flip to the non - flip parts of the coupling ( [ ver ] ) @xmath38 which has been found to be about 0.1 . the predicted asymmetry at hermes energies is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the contribution of the spin - dependent @xmath22 term in ( [ ver ] ) to the double spin @xmath1 asymmetry of the @xmath11 production does not exceed two per cent for the momentum transfer @xmath39 .",
    "sensitivity of the asymmetry to @xmath40 is rather weak . at hera energies",
    ", the asymmetry will be negligible .    for the diffractive @xmath0 leptoproduction",
    "the spin - average and spin - dependent cross section can be written in the form @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a normalization function which is common for the spin average and spin dependent cross section .",
    "the @xmath43 functions are expressed through the same skewed gluon distributions @xmath44 as for vector meson production but at a different scale @xmath45 ( k is a quark momentum ) .",
    "note that @xmath46 is not fixed in this reaction and usually @xmath47    the predicted asymmetry is quite small and does not exceed 1% .",
    "it has a week dependence on the @xmath48 ratio .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 asymmetry is predicted to vanish for @xmath49 as @xmath50 with @xmath51 .    the @xmath22 structure in ( [ ver ] ) should contribute to the @xmath2 asymmetry with longitudinal lepton and transverse proton polarization .",
    "the calculation of this asymmetry is similar to the analysis of @xmath1 , which has been carried out before .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath2 asymmetry is not small and proportional to the @xmath48 ratio .",
    "the @xmath2 asymmetry is proportional to the scalar production of the proton spin vector , and the jet momentum @xmath52 and the asymmetry integrated over the azimuthal jet angle @xmath53 is zero .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 asymmetry for the case when the proton spin vector is perpendicular to the lepton scattering plane and the jet momentum is parallel to this spin vector .",
    "the predicted asymmetry is large and shown in fig .",
    "the reason for the large value of @xmath2 is that we do not find here a small coefficient @xmath46 as for the @xmath1 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "in the present report , the polarized cross section of the diffractive hadron leptoproduction at high energies has been studied .",
    "the two - gluon exchange model with the spin - dependent @xmath54-proton coupling ( [ ver ] ) has been used .",
    "we consider all the graphs where the gluons from the pomeron couple to a different quark in the loop and to the single one .",
    "this provides a gauge - invariant scattering amplitude .",
    "our calculations show that the contribution of the structure @xmath22 in ( [ ver ] ) to @xmath1 is smaller than 1 - 2% .",
    "not small effects in the double spin @xmath1 asymmetry should be determined by the @xmath55 term of the vertex ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "the results obtained here show that diffractive asymmetry in the @xmath0 production vanishes as @xmath56 .",
    "we can conclude that most likely such effects do not provide additional problems in extracting @xmath21 from the @xmath1 asymmetry because the compass experiment plans to study the open charm production at small @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the gluon spd @xmath58 and connected with @xmath21 distribution @xmath59 at the small @xmath60 can be studied from the double spin asymmetry in the vector meson photoproduction .",
    "the contributions of the quark spds are non - negligible for @xmath3 of about 0.1 where the hermes and compass experiments will operate .",
    "thus , in the case of the @xmath61 production the strange quark spd might be studied in addition to the gluon one .",
    "it is found here that the @xmath2 asymmetry of the diffractive heavy quark production is predicted to be not small , about 10 - 20% . it can give direct information about the spin - dependent structure @xmath22 in the @xmath12 coupling . a similar contribution to @xmath2 in the vector meson production",
    "vanishes because of the integration over @xmath62 .",
    "the structure , which is proportional to @xmath63 in the @xmath2 asymmetry of the vector meson production will be studied later .",
