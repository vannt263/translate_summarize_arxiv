    "examples are the 3-torus @xmath6 and @xmath7 but also the poincare sphere . according to @xcite , any compact ,",

    "most importantly , the 3-sphere @xmath5 , @xmath20 and the 3-manifolds @xmath21 with @xmath22 a finite subgroup do not contain incompressible surfaces . the class of 3-manifolds @xmath21 ( the spherical 3-manifolds ) include cases like the poincare sphere ( @xmath23 the binary icosaeder group ) or lens spaces ( @xmath24 the cyclic group ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be irreducible 3-manifolds containing incompressible surfaces then we can @xmath3 split into pieces ( along embedded @xmath9)@xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28-fold connected sum and @xmath22 is a finite subgroup .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath3 is unique up to the order of the factors .",
    "the irreducible 3-manifolds @xmath29 are able to contain incompressible tori and one can split @xmath25 along the tori into simpler pieces @xmath30 @xcite ( called the jsj decomposition ) .",

    "one property of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is central : mostow rigidity .",
    "as shown by mostow @xcite , every hyperbolic @xmath36manifold @xmath37 has this property : _ every diffeomorphism ( especially every conformal transformation ) of a hyperbolic @xmath36manifold is induced by an isometry .",
    "_ therefore one can not scale a hyperbolic 3-manifold and the volume is a topological invariant . together with the prime and jsj decomposition@xmath38 we can discuss the geometric properties central to thurstons geometrization theorem : _ every oriented closed prime 3-manifold can be cut along tori ( jsj decomposition ) , so that the interior of each of the resulting manifolds has a geometric structure with finite volume .",
    "_ now , we have to clarify the term  geometric structure  .",
    "a model geometry is a simply connected smooth manifold @xmath39 together with a transitive action of a lie group @xmath31 on @xmath39 with compact stabilizers .",
    "a geometric structure on a manifold @xmath3 is a diffeomorphism from @xmath3 to @xmath40 for some model geometry @xmath39 , where @xmath41 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath31 acting freely on @xmath39 .",
    "t is a surprising fact that there are also a finite number of three - dimensional model geometries , i.e. 8 geometries with the following models : spherical @xmath42 , euclidean @xmath43 , hyperbolic @xmath44 , mixed spherical - euclidean @xmath45 , mixed hyperbolic - euclidean @xmath46 and 3 exceptional cases called @xmath47 ( twisted version of @xmath48 ) , nil ( geometry of the heisenberg group as twisted version of @xmath49 ) , sol ( split extension of @xmath50 by @xmath51 , i.e. the lie algebra of the group of isometries of 2-dimensional minkowski space ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details .      in this subsection we will shortly discuss the relation between 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds . at first , every oriented , compact 3-manifold is the boundary of a compact , simple - connected 4-manifold ( theorem 2 in chapter vii of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we have to concentrate on simple - connected 4-manifolds , which are classified by freedman @xcite topologically .",
    "the topological classification based on the intersection form @xmath52 of a simple - connected , compact , closed 4-manifold .",
    "the intersection form is a quadratic form over the second homology @xmath53 ( with integer coefficients ) .",
    "an algebraic splitting of the form @xmath54 is realized by a ( topological ) splitting of the 4-manifold ( along homology 3-spheres , see @xcite ) . at this point , there is a big difference between the smooth and the topological case : this algebraic splitting of the form is not always realized by a smooth splitting of the 4-manifold .",
    "a direct consequence is the fact that all homology 3-spheres are bounding contractable , topological 4-manifolds which are not always smoothable .",
    "an example is the poincare sphere , i.e. there is no contractable , smooth 4-manifold with boundary the poincare sphere .",
    "therefore , the assumption of a smooth spacetime is very restrictive as we will see below .",
    "according to the cosmological principle , our expanding universe , although it is so complex , can be considered at very large scale homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the exact solution to einstein s equation , describing a homogeneous , isotropic universe , is in general called the friedmann - lemaitre- robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric .",
    "the flrw model shows that the universe should be , at a given moment of time , either in expansion , or in contraction . from hubble s observations ,",
    "we know that the universe is currently expanding .",
    "the flrw - model shows that , long time ago , there was a very high concentration of matter , which exploded in what we call the big bang .",
    "the singularity theorems of hawking and penrose @xcite showed the necessity for the appearance of singularities including the big bang under general circumstances . in this paper we will consider the main hypothesis : + * main hypothesis * : _ our universe is a compact 3-manifold @xmath2 expanding smoothly so that the spacetime is a smooth 4-manifold @xmath55 .",
    "the topology of the 3-manifold is allowed to change .",
    "the spacetime is a compact , smooth 4-manifold , i.e. we consider only the finite time period from the big bang to the current universe so that @xmath56 . _ + the compactness of the 3-manifold @xmath2 is a hypothesis motivated by the wmap data @xcite .",
    "one of the enigmas of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the low power in the temperature correlations at large angles .",
    "especially the gaps in the spectrum of the background radiation have a simple explanation by assuming a compact universe .",
    "current further investigations @xcite gave the conclusion that the low power at large angles is real with high probability .",
    "one explanation of this suppression of power could be that the universe possesses a non - trivial topology ( multi - connected spatial space i.e. compact 3-manifolds with non - trivial fundamental group ) .",
    "currently three models are discussed , the poincare ( or dodecaeder ) model @xcite ( positive curvature ) , the picard horn @xcite ( negative curvature ) and the flat universe with the 3-torus ( homogeneous model @xcite ) or the half - turn space ( inhomogeneous model @xcite ) .",
    "but the current data are unable to decide between these cases @xcite .",
    "now we study the implications of this hypothesis by using some results of the differential topology of 3- and 4-manifolds .      in the classical case",
    "we assume a singularity , i.e. the existence of a point in the past attracting all geodesics ( pointed backward ) .",
    "a simple example is given by a cone over the circle .",
    "all normals to the circle ( the geodesics of the cone ) converge to the apex . at the same time",
    "one can interpret the cone as a process to contract the circle to a point .",
    "then one uses these geodesics to construct this ( continuous ) contraction map . to generalize this case , we remark that the cone is homeomorphic ( actually also diffeomorphic after smoothing the apex ) to the disk @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we take the 4-disk @xmath57 homeomorphic to the cone @xmath58 over @xmath5 ( @xmath59 denotes  homeomorphic  ) .",
    "this 4-manifold ( compact with boundary ) serves as a model for the  classical  big bang , starting with a singularity ( the apex ) and evolving to the 3-sphere after a finite time .",
    "topologically , the model can be characterized by the property : the cone @xmath60 is contractable to a point , i.e. there is a continuous ( actually also a smooth ) homotopy @xmath61 .",
    "but we may ask : is this model the most general case ?",
    "we will partly answer this question in the following .    to fix the problem",
    ", we have to consider the class of smooth , compact , contractable 4-manifolds .",
    "contractability is needed ( but not necessary ) to obtain a lorentz metric outside of the big bang singularity has euler characteristics @xmath62 but the excision of one point gives the desired result @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore contractability guarantees that there is no topology change after the big bang .",
    "we will later discuss the case of an explicit topology change .",
    "we remark that in topology there exists also a general procedure to construct the cone @xmath64 ) over a topological space @xmath2 by@xmath65}{\\sigma\\times\\{1\\}\\sim\\{\\star\\}}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is contracted to a point @xmath67 ( the apex ) .",
    "the cone @xmath64 ) is contractable but it is in most cases not a manifold but an orbifold ( it fails to be locally modeled on open subsets of @xmath0 but instead on quotients of open subsets of @xmath0 by finite group actions ) .",
    "therefore a whole neighborhood of the singularity fails to be a manifold . to illustrate this singularity we consider the cone over the 3-sphere again .",
    "the homeomorphism between the cone @xmath60 and the 4-disk is known as alexanders trick , i.e. a homeomorphism of the two boundaries @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be extended to a homeomorphism @xmath58 .",
    "this fails for the 3-torus .",
    "the cone @xmath70 contains a 3-torus for every value @xmath71 but not at @xmath72 ( where it is a point ) .",
    "therefore the neighborhood of this point do not look like @xmath73 $ ] ( with the finite interval @xmath74 $ ] ) , @xmath72 is a so - called non - flat point in topology .",
    "especially the neighborhood is not an open subset of @xmath0 ( but rather @xmath75 ) .",
    "all tangent vectors at @xmath72 vanishes , i.e. the point is non - smooth and can not be smoothly approximated ( like in the case @xmath60 ) .",
    "the whole discussion remains true for every 4-space @xmath76 with @xmath2 a 3-manifold having a different homology then the 3-sphere ( see below ) .",
    "our current understanding of the singularity ( see @xcite ) gives a manifold structure in the neighborhood of the singularity , i.e. einsteins equation gives a smooth solution except for the singular point .",
    "therefore the model of the 3-torus , the picard horn or half - turn space is singled out ( or one has to assume a non - smooth transition ) .",
    "but then we are left with a contractable , smooth 4-manifold as a model of the spacetime ( for finite times ) .",
    "freedman @xcite solves the problem to find all compact , contractable , topological 4-manifolds .",
    "he proved that any homology 3-sphere ( i.e. a compact 3-manifold with the same homology groups as the 3-sphere ) bounds a compact , contractable , topological 4-manifold .",
    "but as a corollary to donaldson s theory @xcite , not all homology 3-spheres are the boundary of a * smooth * compact contractable 4-manifold ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one example is the poincare homology 3-sphere bounding only a topological ( but non - smooth ) compact contractable 4-manifold .",
    "a further division for all possible cases is given by the inclusion of the geometric structure , i.e the existence of homogeneous metrics on @xmath2 .",
    "especially we concentrated our discussion to the case of prime 3-manifolds .",
    "the following cases for prime homology 3-spheres are possible :    1 .",
    "spherical geometry ( positive scalar curvature ) : there are only two homology 3-spheres with this geometry : the 3-sphere @xmath5 and the poincare sphere ( or sums of these cases ) . the poincare sphere can be excluded by donaldson theory ( see above ) . the geometry @xmath77 can be also excluded , there is no homology 3-sphere with this geometry .",
    "flat geometry ( euclidean geometry or nil geometry ) : there are no homology 3-sphere carrying a homogeneous , flat metric .",
    "negative curvatures ( hyperbolic and @xmath47 geometry ) : the class of homogeneous metrics with a negative curvature ( at least along one direction ) forms the largest class of possible geometric structures on homology 3-spheres .",
    "all members of the special class of seifert fibred homology 3-spheres have the @xmath47 geometry .",
    "an example is the brieskorn sphere @xmath78 defined by the set @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( which is the boundary of the famous mazur manifold @xcite , a contractable smooth 4-manifold ) .",
    "examples of hyperbolic homology 3-spheres can be constructed by using @xmath81 dehn surgery @xcite along hyperbolic knots as smooth embedding @xmath82 is hyperbolic if its complement @xmath83 is a hyperbolic 3-manifold ( with boundary a torus ) , i.e. a 3-manifold with a homogeneous metric in the interior . ] .",
    "examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds bounding contractable smooth 4-manifolds are generated by the knots @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( in rolfsen notation , see fig .",
    "[ fig :- dehn - surgery - contractable-4mf ] ) whereas hyperbolic knots like the figure 8-knot @xmath86 or the knot @xmath87 are excluded ( see fig .",
    "[ fig :- dehn - surgery - non - contractable-4mf ] ) .",
    "dehn surgery along these knots ( @xmath88 ) generates 3-manifolds bounding smoothly contractable 4-manifolds[fig :- dehn - surgery - contractable-4mf],title=\"fig : \" ]   dehn surgery along these knots ( @xmath88 ) generates 3-manifolds bounding smoothly contractable 4-manifolds[fig :-",

    "as we saw above the poincare sphere @xmath90 can not be a boundary of this kind but the following sum@xmath91 where @xmath25 are prime hyperbolic homology 3-spheres has to smoothly embed into @xmath92 . ] ( for instance generated by the knots @xmath84 , @xmath85 or @xmath93 via @xmath81 dehn surgery , see fig .",
    "[ fig :- dehn - surgery - contractable-4mf ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the poincare model @xcite of the cosmos is correct then one has to use the sum of two poincare spheres .",
    "otherwise one has to assume a non - smooth topology change in the primordial phase of the cosmos .",
    "our discussion has excluded ( like the 3-torus ) or restricted ( like the poincare sphere ) many interesting models of the cosmos . here",
    "we want to consider the possible restrictions for a model without singularity inspired by loop quantum gravity . in @xcite , ashtekar et.al . described a cosmological model showing the effect of a big bounce ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then this model does not show a singularity , i.e. there is no big crunch and the contraction is followed by an expansion again .",
    "the crucial point is the determination of the initial state .",
    "the following assumptions are physically plausible :    * the ( spatial ) cosmos at the  big bounce point  is closed ( no boundary ) . *",
    "it consists of a minimal number of elementary cells .",
    "the first assumption favors a compact , closed 3-manifold . using homology theory",
    ", we have to use at least two cells ( glued together along the common boundary ) to fulfill the second assumption .",
    "it singles out the 3-sphere ( uniquely using the solution to the poincare conjecture ) .",
    "therefore the big bounce model starts with a ( planck - sized ) 3-sphere @xmath5 and evolved smoothly to a closed , compact 3-manifold @xmath2(see the main hypothesis above ) .",
    "although this starting point is different from the singularity in the previous subsection , the results are quite similar .",
    "at first we remark that the evolution from the 3-sphere @xmath5 to @xmath2 is a smooth 4-manifold , a cobordism @xmath94 between @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "we can close partly this cobordism along the 3-sphere by using a 4-disk , @xmath95 , to get a contractable 4-manifold with boundary @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we obtain the same restrictions as above : @xmath2 must be a homology 3-sphere which bounds a smooth , contractable , compact 4-manifold . again",
    "the case of a single poincare sphere is excluded ( by donaldson theory ) .",
    "the list of prime homology 3-spheres agrees with the list above .",
    "a difference to the results above is the flat case ( i.e. with euclidean or nil geometry ) .",
    "the simplest example is the 3-torus @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "now we have to consider a ( smooth ) cobordism @xmath96 between the 3-sphere and the 3-torus .",
    "but then we obtain a topology change from the simple - connected 3-sphere to the multiple - connected 3-torus .",
    "especially the cobordism @xmath96 itself is not a simple - connected , compact 4-manifold ( in contrast to a cobordism @xmath94 between @xmath5 and the homology 3-sphere ) . as discussed in @xcite , the cobordism @xmath96 ( a morse cobordism in the notation of @xcite ) gives rise to causal discontinuities ( in the sense of the borde - sorkin conjecture @xcite ) and allows the singular propagation of a quantum field ( like in the trousers spacetime in @xmath97 dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "but there is also a second argument against the appearance of the cobordism @xmath96 : clearly @xmath96 is a lorentz cobordism but the mod-2 kervaire semi - characteristics @xmath98",
    "gives@xmath99 i.e. the cobordism @xmath96 is not a spin - lorentz cobordism ( see @xcite ) or it do not admit a @xmath100spin structure ( defining an unique parallel transport of a spinor ) . the case of a nil geometry is similar . the corresponding 3-manifold @xmath101 is a twisted 3-torus : consider @xmath102 $ ] and identify @xmath103 and @xmath104 by a diffeomorphism @xmath105 . if @xmath106 is of finite order then @xmath107 has euclidean geometry and if @xmath106 is a dehn twist then @xmath107 has nil geometry .",
    "the remaining case ( anosov map ) leads to the sol geometry ( as twisted @xmath48 geometry with negative curvature ) . ] but leading to the same mod-2 kervaire semi - characteristics @xmath108 with the same result : it is not a spin - lorentz cobordism .",
    "in this paper we discussed the differential - topological restrictions on the spacetime for the evolution of our universe with an explicit big bang singularity and for models with the big bounce effect .",
    "surprisingly , the results are the same for both cases .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the main restriction comes from the assumption of a smooth spacetime .",
    "the relaxation of this smoothness assumption causes in bad singularities like non - manifold points or complicated topology changes with causal discontinuities .",
    "especially the poincare sphere , the picard horn or the 3-torus are not favored .",
