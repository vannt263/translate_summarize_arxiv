    "bell @xcite established an inequality , which was later extended and reformulated @xcite , obeyed by a large family of theories , deterministic or statistical , based on the assumption that the quantum state is not the ultimate limit , but that there may be additional parameters , the hidden variables , providing a finer description .",
    "experiments do not only violate the inequality , but they also reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions with high precision and accuracy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the empirical data show an increasing agreement with quantum mechanics as experimental techniques become more refined .    here",
    ", we shall extrapolate this trend , and assume that quantum mechanics is obeyed exactly , in absence of any knowledge about the hidden variable .",
    "this puts further restrictions on the admissible hidden - variable theories , as they must not only violate bell inequality , but also reproduce quantum mechanics after the hidden variables are averaged out . under the hypotheses that the hidden - variable models satisfy the locality condition and the free will assumption , it is possible to determine their shape , thus going beyond bell s theorem .",
    "the main result of this work was published in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we just give a more compact account of the result , while dedicating some more space to epistemological issues .",
    "bell inequality follows easily under the assumption that the joint probability @xmath0 of observing an outcome @xmath1 at a detector characterized by @xmath2 and @xmath3 at a detector characterized by @xmath4 , for a fixed preparation @xmath5 , can be decomposed as @xmath6 with @xmath7 a positive distribution normalized to one , and @xmath8 marginal probability conditioned on @xmath9 . in the following , we shall consider implicit for brevity the dependence on @xmath5 , as the preparation does not change .",
    "we remark that applying bayes rule , the probability generally factors as @xmath10 with @xmath11 conditional probability for given @xmath12 . in order to comply with eq .  , the models considered by bell must satisfy three hypotheses : @xmath13 , often justified on the basis of  free will \" , but which we shall address with the technical term uncorrelated choice ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 , called `` setting - independence '' , sometimes identified with the no - signaling principle , mistakenly ; @xmath16 , called in the literature outcome - independence , which we shall call  reducibility of correlations \" .",
    "let us discuss these assumptions .",
    "this assumption means that the choice of measurement and the distribution of the hidden variables @xmath9 are uncorrelated , so that there is no causal connection between the two .",
    "let us assume momentarily that uc does not hold .",
    "if one thinks of @xmath9 as a set of parameters attached to the physical system , and assumes that the choice of measurement @xmath17 is the cause and the change in the distribution @xmath18 is the effect , then a violation of uncorrelated choice would result in non - locality .",
    "however , if one inverts the cause - effect relationship , then a violation of uncorrelated choice corresponds to a limitation of free will @xcite . as an example , think of an astronaut on a distant planet , who is video - communicating with an engineer at nasa .",
    "you notice that , after subtracting the time delay due to the finite speed of communication , when the astronaut raises her left arm , the engineer does as well , and so when she scratches her head , etc .",
    "what could you conclude by observing such correlations ?",
    "perhaps the astronaut has access to an image of the engineer through some superluminal channel , and is just mimicking the gestures she can see in advance , or vice versa ; perhaps the astronaut and the engineer have agreed to make those gestures at those times , in the first interplanetary flashmob ever ; or perhaps they have no free will , and the same forces that determine his movements are determining hers .",
    "thus , as pointed out e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is no way one can decide whether the correlations are due to conspiracy , non - locality , or slave will , unless a physical theory is formulated that describes how the decisions to do a movement ( i.e. , discontinuing the metaphor , to choose a measurement ) are taken .",
    "marketing experts and statisticians can confirm that people who are exposed to the same advertisements or who share the same social conditions tend to buy the same products or to vote for the same candidate .",
    "thus , we could accept a limitation of free will .",
    "however , with respect to the hypothesis of uncorrelated choice , we make the following consideration : the experimenters deciding the settings @xmath19 can delegate the choice to third parties , as for instance the fluctuations in the voltage of an electric socket , the variations in the albedo of a distant star , etc . as there is empirical evidence @xcite that bell inequality",
    "is violated in this case as well , the only possible conclusion , if one insists that uc is violated , is that there is a leibnitzian pre - established harmony , where the hidden variables determine not only the choice of @xmath19 , but also the choice of an apparent random process among a multitude of possible ones .",
    "furthermore , the outcome of this apparently random process is determined as well by @xmath9 .",
    "thus , while we can not rule out a violation of free will as an explanation , we can say , based on partial experimental evidence , that if this is the case then we should admit a cosmic choreography .",
    "as far as a theory of the intentions and preferences of the choreographer is not put forward , the assumption is untestable , as it can explain anything and predict nothing , and thus we should store it away , together with solipsism and intelligent design . in conclusion , we do assume that uncorrelated choice holds .",
    "this hypothesis requires that the marginal probability of observing an event @xmath12 in a space - time region @xmath20 , for a given @xmath9 , does not depend on the settings @xmath21 at space - time regions outside of the lightcone ( past and future ) of @xmath20 .",
    "often , si is considered as synonymous of no - signaling , a form of locality , in the sense that if si holds , then it is impossible to send superluminal signals from a region @xmath22 to a region @xmath20 . actually si is weaker than no - signaling , as si may hold but signaling still be possible .",
    "let us see how : suppose that the hidden variables @xmath9 can be divided in @xmath23 , a set of parameters localized in region @xmath20 , @xmath24 , localized in region @xmath22 , and possibly @xmath25 , a set of global parameters that can not be associated to any particular region ( the wave function of entangled particles is an example of a global parameter ) .",
    "the assumption si allows the marginal probability at @xmath20 to depend on @xmath24 , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , if @xmath24 changes , so does the marginal probability at @xmath20 . by receiving a large number of particles in parallel and estimating",
    "the marginal probability by the frequency of observing @xmath12 , an observer at @xmath20 can thus receive an instantaneous message from an observer at @xmath22 , provided the latter has a way to influence @xmath24 . to me , the existence of this non - locality is dubious , and therefore i shall assume that si holds , and furthermore that the marginal probability does not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "a special case of si is the compliance with malus s law , postulated by leggett in the derivation of a new inequality @xcite .",
    "it requires that the hidden - variables consist in two unit vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , such that the marginal probabilities are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "there is a result @xcite , which we may call the _ trivial - marginals theorem _ , establishing that all theories that obey uc and si , and that also reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions for a spin singlet must have a marginal probability @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the compliance with malus s law is excluded , and in the following we shall use this theorem , which also guarantees the locality of the models .",
    "this assumption , called outcome - independence by shimony @xcite , states that @xmath32 , i.e. the conditional probability of obtaining an outcome @xmath33 , for fixed @xmath9 and given that the outcome of the remote measurement along @xmath2 is @xmath12 , does not depend on the latter outcome .",
    "hence , after applying bayes rule , the joint probability factorizes symmetrically @xmath34 .",
    "hence , for fixed parameters @xmath9 , there would be no correlations , and these would appear only after averaging over @xmath9 .",
    "thus the assumption of reducibility of correlations amounts to state that the quantum correlations are a result of the ignorance of more fundamental parameters .",
    "the hypothesis rc is implied by determinism , in the sense that , if by knowing @xmath9 one may predict with certainty whether the outcome @xmath33 will occur or not , then the knowledge of the outcome @xmath12 is superfluous .",
    "while the vice versa is not true , however , a theorem established by m. hall @xcite shows that any model obeying rc admits a natural deterministic completion , i.e. a description in terms of additional variables @xmath7 such that @xmath35 .",
    "thus , rc generalizes the concept of determinism .    in order to verify whether reducibility of correlations holds",
    ", an observer in the region @xmath20 should ask the observer at @xmath22 about the @xmath33 he measured and the @xmath4 he used , then evaluate the conditional probability @xmath36 , and finally check whether this quantity changes with @xmath33 , with the remaining parameters fixed . in order to do so , @xmath20 must have access to the remote information @xmath37 , which @xmath22 can send only at a speed not exceeding the speed of light . hence , violating reducibility of correlations does not imply action - at - a - distance , nor the possibility of instantaneous communication . yet",
    ", the locution `` quantum nonlocality '' is widely used .",
    "the reason is that originally bell @xcite did assume determinism , thus justifying rc , and locality .",
    "later generalizations of bell inequality @xcite dropped the hypothesis of determinism , but kept assuming rc , in the mistaken belief that this was a consequence of locality , not of determinism .",
    "jarrett @xcite , and subsequently shimony @xcite , pointed out that rc does not follow from the notion of locality , as commonly meant .",
    "this resulted in some new terminology being introduced to refer to both the hypothesis si and rc : strong locality @xcite , bell locality , local causality @xcite .",
    "after a while , this distinction fell , and unfortunately many studies of bell inequality refer to the two hypotheses si and rc ( and sometimes uc ) as `` locality '' , while the reader of the present manuscript should be aware that this is just a misnomer : there is no factual evidence of an intrinsic non - locality in nature .",
    "furthermore , the presumed non - locality of nature ( or of quantum mechanics ) would be of a very peculiar kind , as it would manifest in the kinematics . by this , we mean that , since ordinary quantum mechanics is , as classical mechanics , a non - relativistic theory , it can accept non - local forces ( think , e.g. , to newtonian gravitation or coulomb s law ) .",
    "however , the `` non - locality '' of entangled states manifests when there is no known interaction between the two subsystems , and thus it would be a feature of the very kinematics of the theory , i.e. we would have `` non - locality '' without interaction , a patent absurdity .    in the following , we shall assume that the hypothesis rc does not hold , as this is the only assumption not fully justified by physical considerations .",
    "as one or more of the three hypotheses discussed in the previous section are dropped , it is possible to violate bell inequality .",
    "however , this is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to reproduce experimental data , as these agree well with the predictions of quantum mechanics . in the appendix , we review some significant models that reproduce the probability for the spin singlet after averaging out the hidden variables .",
    "none of these models relies solely on the violation of reducibility of correlations .",
    "as our goal is to find models that reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions , @xmath38 , and that obey both uc and si , we can apply the trivial - marginals theorem , so that the joint probability can be written as @xmath39.\\ ] ] the question that we ask is : what functions @xmath40 are admissible ( i.e. give a probability between 0 and 1 ) so that the quantum mechanical predictions are reproduced after averaging out @xmath9 ?",
    "the main idea is of using the tools of calculus to approach this problem , while former approaches rely on algebra . without",
    "loss of generality we can write @xmath41 clearly , @xmath42 identically in @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 must take both positive and negative values .",
    "furthermore , let us take @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "then the probability , conditioned on @xmath9 , reduces to @xmath47 , and this implies that @xmath48 .",
    "analogously , you can prove that @xmath49 .",
    "thus , perfect correlations and anti - correlations limit the admissible @xmath44 to the form @xmath50^{s_+}\\left[1-\\bi{a}\\cdot\\bi{b}\\right]^{s_- }   g(\\lambda,\\bi{a},\\bi{b}),\\ ] ] with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . this is but a frobenius expansion , with the indices @xmath53 determining how fast the function vanishes close to the perfect ( anti-)correlations configuration @xmath54 .",
    "compatibility with quantum mechanics requires @xmath55    now , let us consider a configuration close to the perfect anticorrelation @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 , \\ ] ] the positivity of the probability implies that @xmath59 .",
    "the inequality @xmath60 is proved analogously .",
    "in conclusion , we have established the form of all the hidden variable models able to reproduce the quantum mechanics of a spin - singlet by satisfying both the assumptions of free will and no - signaling , which correspond , respectively , to uncorrelated choice ( measurement - independence ) and setting - independence . by contrast",
    ", we have assumed the violation of reducibility of correlations , as this can never result in superluminal signaling , since it consists in the dependence of a conditional probability on a remote outcome , and as such it requires the communication of said outcome through means that are necessarily subluminal .",
    "rather , the violation of reducibility of correlations implies that the quantum correlations can not be attributed to the ignorance of the hidden parameters .",
    "this work was performed as part of the brazilian instituto nacional de cincia e tecnologia para a informao quntica ( inct  iq ) and it was supported by fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de minas gerais through processes no .",
    "apq-02804 - 10 and pee-00421 - 12 .",
    "in the literature there is a handful of hidden - variable models able to reproduce quantum mechanics for a spin - singlet .",
    "these models must violate at least one of bell s hypotheses .",
    "however , as it is not always clear which hypotheses are dropped , we shall briefly review the existing ( to the best of our knowledge ) models .",
    "we recall that a hidden - variable theory predicts the decomposition of the quantum probability as @xmath61.\\ ] ] inspection of @xmath62 , depending whether it depends on @xmath43 or not , allows to establish if uncorrelated choice holds . after extracting the marginal probability @xmath63 from @xmath64",
    ", one can check whether setting - independence ( and possibly malus s law ) is satisfied . finally ,",
    "obtaining the conditional probability @xmath65 , the hypothesis of reducibility of correlations can be checked .",
    "brans @xcite proposed the following model using four discrete binary hidden - variables and two unit - vectors : @xmath66 the symbol @xmath67 denotes the eigenstate @xmath68 of the spin component @xmath69 .",
    "thus , brans s model violates only the uncorrelated choice hypothesis . using the standard definition of spin eigenstates that can be found in sakurai s textbook @xcite , after some algebra one gets @xmath70",

    "in conclusion , brans s model , properly formulated in terms of a real and positive distribution , turns out to be trivial : there are four hidden variables @xmath78 , distributed according to eq .  , so that the conditional distribution of @xmath79 for given @xmath80 mimics by construction the quantum mechanical distribution , @xmath81 . the variables @xmath79 are fixed by eq .   to coincide with the observed values of @xmath82 , while @xmath80 , in virtue of eq .",
