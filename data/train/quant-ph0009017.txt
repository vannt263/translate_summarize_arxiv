    "for calculating the free energy of a system , there exist usually two basic methods , the conventional perturbative and the variational methods @xcite .",
    "in fact , these two methods are standard in calculations of many physics problems .",
    "however , it is well known that the former is useful only for small perturbing potentials , whereas the latter lacks systematic schemes to control its accuracy , albeit it is valid for any potential . in order to overcome these difficulties and improve the variational method , a variational perturbation idea of properly combining the two methods",
    "was pioneered by koehler in lattice dynamics @xcite and seznec and zinn - justin @xcite on an anharmonic osillator decades ago .",
    "later , the idea was extended to path integrals by feynman and kleinert @xcite as well as okopi@xmath0ska @xcite , and further developed by other authors @xcite .",
    "very recently , three of the authors ( you , kim and nahm ) and their collaborator presented a variational perturbation scheme for a nonrelativistic many - fermion system in the functional integral formalism @xcite . in order to test the efficiency of the method , ref .",
    "@xcite provided a model numerical calculation at the zero temperature up to the second order .",
    "obviously , this test is limited , and a more wide investigation is necessary for the variational perturbation scheme .    actually , the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite is a taylor series expansion based on the variational result obtained in the spirit of feynman variational principle @xcite .",
    "this scheme can improve the variational method if used judicially .",
    "we note that there exists no work performing the same scheme for bosonic systems .",
    "although okopi@xmath0ska @xcite and krzyweck",
    "@xcite established two kinds of expansion schemes , the optimized expansions and the cumulant expansions respectively , whose lowest order results are the variational result , they are really not based on the variational result because the variational procedure was performed at the truncated order .",
    "further , improvement to the variational method is notoriously difficult , and different schemes will have their own advantages over others . so",
    "it is worthwhile generalizing the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite to bosonic systems .    for the above two purposes ,",
    "an anharmonic oscillator will be an effective laboratory .",
    "for a one - dimensional anharmonic oscillator , the hamiltonian is @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the space position , @xmath3 the momentum , @xmath4 the time , and @xmath5 as well as @xmath6 are the mass , frequency and coupling strength , respectively .",
    "such an anharmonic oscillator is probably the simplest model which does not have exact analytic solution .",
    "its exact free energy was obtained numerically @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist many approximation methods to calculate its free energy @xcite .",
    "all of these make eq.(1 ) an ideal candidate for our aim .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will generalize the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking the simple anharmonic oscillator , eq.(1 ) , as a laboratory and investigate the taylor expansion scheme on the free energy based on the variational result obtained from the feynman variational principle @xcite .    simultaneously , the anharmonic oscillator itself is useful in chemical physics @xcite and many physics problems , such as thermal expansion , phonon softening and structural phase transitions @xcite .",
    "although its free energy was calculated by using many methods , their numerical ( approximate and exact ) results were focused mainly on the case of the reduced temperature @xmath7 less than 1 , except for ref .",
    "@xcite which provided accurate results at moderate @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we also test whether our scheme can produce reliable results at moderate temperature range .",
    "we will work within the functional integral formalism @xcite .",

    ", we can now readily calculate the free energy up to the fourth order : @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the following",
    ", we will numerically compare them with existing results to examine rediability of our scheme .",
    "first , we compare our results with the exact results obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite . using @xmath100 $ ] ( @xmath101 is the @xmath53th eigenenergy of eq.(1 ) ) ,",
    "letting @xmath102 , and for @xmath103 , one can calculate the exact free energies from table v in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this case , we plot fig.1 with @xmath104 . in fig.1 , the dotted , short - dashed , medium - dashed , long - dashed and solid curves are the exact free energy @xmath105 , @xmath45 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "fig.1 indicates that : ( i ) when the temperature is near zero , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are very to close @xmath109 , whereas @xmath108 is unbounded from below ; ( ii ) when the temperature is greater than @xmath110 or so , @xmath106 and @xmath108 provide substantial corrections to @xmath45 , and @xmath108 gives better than @xmath106 does , while @xmath107 is close to @xmath45 . here",
    ", we note that the invalidity of @xmath108 at very low temperature is not unexpected .",
    "since the present scheme is basically the taylor expansion of the free energy , the smallness of the temperature prevents and competes with the convergence process of the perturbation and finally wins over at the fourth order .    then , we can compare our results with the accurate free energies , @xmath111 from the okopi@xmath0ska s optimized variational method @xcite .",
    "in order to compare with okopi@xmath0ska s data , we used the definitions of the dimensionless quantities in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . , and here it is corrected . ] for the case of @xmath117 , which corresponds to @xmath118 in the dimensionlized system of ref .",
    "@xcite , we give the comparison in table i.ska , the author of ref .  @xcite . ] from this table , one can see that @xmath108 has a better agreement with @xmath111 than @xmath119 and @xmath45 except for @xmath120 .",
    "thirdly , to show the improvement of @xmath45 by higher - order corrections , for the range of @xmath121 , we plotted the results in fig.2 to compare @xmath108 with @xmath45 in the cases of @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in fig.2 , we use the same curve type to represent @xmath108 and @xmath45 , and between the curves within the same type , @xmath108 is always the lower .",
    "also , fig.2 shows that @xmath108 coincides almost with @xmath45 for @xmath124 and @xmath123 , and the differences between @xmath45 and @xmath108 are quite large for both @xmath125 and @xmath126 . from fig.2",
    ", we learn that : ( i ) for a given temperature , with the increase of @xmath127 , @xmath41 , with weakening the coupling , the corrections of @xmath108 to @xmath45 get smaller ; ( ii ) for a given @xmath127 , with the increase of @xmath7 , the corrections of @xmath108 to @xmath45 become larger ; ( iii ) the quite large differences between @xmath45 and @xmath108 imply that our scheme becomes invalid with decreasing @xmath127 or with increasing coupling strength ( for a fixed @xmath128 ) .",
    "the third point is similar to the optimized expansion @xcite ( 1994 ) .",
    "finally , taking @xmath102 , we compare our results with those obtained from the cumulant expansions @xcite in table ii . in table",
    "ii , the free energies @xmath106 and @xmath107 are ours , the free energies @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the first- and third - order results from the cumulant expansion in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath41 , @xmath131 and @xmath106 of table ii in ref .",
    "the temperatures in this table is lower than @xmath132 and the corresponding @xmath127 is small .",
    "so we did not include @xmath108 in the table due to its invalidity .",
    "this table indicates that our @xmath106 and @xmath107 are nearer to the exact value than @xmath129 , but is not so good as @xmath130 .",
    "this reflects that the convergency of our expansion is not so fast as in the cumulant expansions in ref .",
    "@xcite . as for the optimized expansions , ref .",
    "@xcite compared the free energy with the exact results in the case of both @xmath133 ( @xmath41 , the smallest @xmath127 ) and the reduced temperature less than @xmath132 , and demonstrated a fast convergence . here , in fig.3 ,",
    "our results are compared at various orders with fig.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 1994).ska . ] in fig.3 , from the upper to lower ( for large values of @xmath134 ) , the first , second , sixth and seventh curves are the variational , the third- , the second- and the fourth - order results of our scheme , respectively .",
    "the third and the fourth curves are the second- and the third - order results of the optimized expansions , and the fifth curve is the exact result . the variational result is just the first - order result in the optimized expansions . from this figure ,",
    "our third - order result is not so good as the results in the optimized expansions , and our second - order result is almost as good as the second - order results in the optimized expansions .",
    "this figure simultaniously indicates the invalidity of our fourth - order result .",
    "thus , the optimized expansion has also a better convergency than our results .",
    "additionally , the optimized expansions approach the exact result monotonously in orders , whereas our results oscillate with orders . however , we want to emphasize that our sheme is not so complicated as the optimized and cumulant expansions .",
    "the crucial difference between ours and the optimized or the cumulant expansions is that our scheme performs the variational procedure at the lowest order and , accordingly , the parameter @xmath19 is identical for all orders , whereas in both the optimized and the cumulant expansions @xcite , the variational procedure are performed at their truncated order , and , consequently , @xmath19 at one order is different from the next .",
    "it is this difference that gives rise to the simplicity and slow convergency of our scheme and the fast convergency and complication of the optimized or cumulant expansions .",
    "in this paper , we have generalized the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite to a bosonic case , and taking the anharmonic oscillator , eq.(1 ) , as a laboratory , provided a wide test of its efficiency .",
    "our investigations demonstrate that the present scheme can substantially improve the variational result even in the second order and when the reduced temperature is greater than @xmath110 or so and the reduced coupling parameter @xmath6 is not strong ( or @xmath127 is small ) , the free energy for eq.(1 ) up to the fourth order in our expansion gives a good agreement with the accurate result .",
    "we also demonstrate that for the free energy of eq.(1 ) , when the reduced temperature approach zero , or the reduced coupling @xmath6 is strong ( or @xmath127 is small ) , the fourth - order result is invalid .",
    "thus , from our investigations here , one can see the efficiency and limitations of our scheme . here",
    ", we also note that the present scheme is much simpler than the optimized and cumulant expansions , albeit it is not so fast convergent as they are .",
    "we believe that a simple scheme is often necessary and useful because the non - perturbative method beyond the gaussian approximation is extremely complicated in general .",
    "additionally , we gave the approximate free energy of the system , eq.(1 ) , for moderate temperature range .",
    "although the exact results for the moderate temperature has existed in the literature @xcite , our results can be readily used , as a basis of quantitative comparison , when some other approximate methods produce the free energy at the same temperature range .",
    "in general , it should be noted that the variational perturbation theory yields an asymptotic rather than a convergent series @xcite , and hence a concrete range of its validity in a specific problem has no universality . as for any specific problem",
    ", the present scheme should always be used with a judicial examination of the true physical property .",
    "we believe that the present paper can provide a qualitative reference for an application of our scheme .",
    "in particular , when a specific problem is too complicated to treat beyond the gaussian approximation with other expansions , we believe that our scheme can provide a simple and viable tool to treat it .    finally , we want to point out that , although we treated the quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillator only in this paper , it is straightforward to apply our method to finite temperture scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "especially , when it is generalized to the @xmath135 models @xcite , we expect that the simplicity of the method still holds there .",
