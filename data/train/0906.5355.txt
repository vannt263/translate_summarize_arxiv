    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) is an experiment designed to explore systematically the optical transient and variable sky .",
    "the main goal of this project is to fill the gaps in our present - day knowledge of the optical transient phase space ( figure  [ fig : magtau ] ) .",
    "besides reasonably well - studied populations ( e.g. , classical novae , supernovae ) , there exist many types of either poorly constrained events ( e.g. , luminous red novae , tidal disruption flares ) or predicted but not yet discovered phenomena ( e.g. , orphan afterglows of @xmath2-ray bursts )",
    ". here , dedicated wide - field instruments have the best prospect of leading to significant progress .    a number of surveys ( summarized in table  [ tab : surveys ] )",
    "have attempted this challenging task and have provided important contributions to our understanding of time - domain science . the majority of these projects , however , have been designed ( especially in terms of cadence ) to maximize the discovery probability for selected source populations ( typically microlensing , classical novae , or supernovae ) .",
    "thus , large areas of the phase space remain poorly explored at best and are ripe for investigation with ptf .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the scientific goals of ptf and to provide predictions for discoveries during the first four years of operation . in order to give the reader an overview of the project ,",
    "we start by summarizing the important instrumental aspects of ptf and the general survey strategy . much more detailed discussion of the ptf system , both hardware and software , can be found in a separate publication @xcite .",

    "vertically hatched boxes show classes for which only few ( @xmath3 ) candidate members have been suggested so far ( luminous red novae , tidal disruption flares , luminous supernovae ) .",

    "the first few months after first light in december 13th 2008 have been used for commissioning of the instrument and software .",
    "initial observations were taken to construct a fiducial reference image of the sky for later use in transient detection .    following commissioning",
    ", ptf will be operating on 80% ( @xmath24 night yr@xmath1 ) of the p48 nights until at least the end of 2012 . during this time",
    "several predefined long - term surveys and a number of evolving experiments will be performed .",

    "in particular , asteroids will form the dominant variable foreground population . depending on ecliptic latitude , the predicted number of known asteroids brighter than @xmath25mag ranges from @xmath26deg@xmath1 ( @xmath27deg ) to @xmath28deg@xmath1 ( @xmath29deg ) .",
    "near - earth objects ( neos ) are a subgroup of asteroids and comets that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the earth s neighborhood .",
    "they are of astronomical interest as nearby samples of planetesimals left over from the formation of the solar system .",
    "the earth was built from such planetesimals , and the outer layers of earth , including the biosphere , have been strongly effected by asteroids and comets that impacted the early planet after it had solidified .",
    "neo discovery and characterization is also critical to assessing the impact risk hazard , as objects of size 1 km could have catastrophic planet - wide consequences . here",
    ", ptf will contribute to neo discovery and orbit determination by delivering astrometric and photometric measurements comparable ( or even superior ) to the those of the best currently - operating surveys ( table  [ tab : neo ] ) . in this way",

    "the first direct detection of gravitational waves is expected to come from the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) in its enhanced ( start @xmath30 ) and advanced ( @xmath31 ) stages .",
    "a variety of sources , including nearby supernovae and merging compact objects , will be found in this way . with typical positional uncertainties of a few degrees , only wide - field instruments like ptf",
    "will be able to search for optical counterparts , provide arcsecond localizations , and allow estimates of distance .",
    "theory suggests that a few percent of all stellar collapses to neutron stars and black holes will result in strong gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "models include accretion - induced collapse leading to bar - unstable neutron stars @xcite , and stars that collapse to black holes with very rapidly rotating cores @xcite .",
    "these events will likely be optically faint compared to standard supernovae , but still detectable in the nearby universe with ptf .",
    "once identified , the light curves will provide insight into the explosion physics as well as into the fraction of radioactive material advected into the black hole .",
    "similarly , observations of the expected dim supernovae @xcite or macronovae @xcite associated with ligo - detected merging compact objects will immediately lead to a trove of results .",
    "in particular , the ejected mass is sensitive to the equation of state of dense matter and the type of binary ( double neutron star vs. neutron star / black hole ) .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory ( klein et al . 2008 ) will soon deliver automated alerts to follow - up observations of detections of pairs of neutrinos . with typical positional uncertainties of these events of 12 , ptf can help to find the optical counterparts .",
    "ptf will also advance our understanding of the new class of mysterious radio transients which has materialized in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these events were discovered in archival data ; thus , nothing is known about their transient appearance at other wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , no quiescent x - ray , optical , near - infrared , and radio counterparts have been found .",
    "the event rate is overwhelming and estimated to be between 100 and 13,000deg@xmath32yr@xmath1 with typical time scales of @xmath330.11d . within the framework of the dynamic cadence experiments , and in combination with new radio observations , ptf will attempt to resolve the nature of these events and probe their possible association with the elusive galactic population of isolated - old neutron stars @xcite .      by the end of 2012",
    ", ptf will have observed each pointing in the 5dc footprint ( i.e. , @xmath34deg@xmath14 ) about 60 times .",
    "the combined @xmath15-band images will be deeper than the sdss @xmath35-band images by about 12mag .",
    "although the typical image quality will be 2 , these data will provide an excellent deep fiducial sky for many astronomical projects and can be mined for a variety of large - scale science applications .    as discussed in section  [ sec : strategy ] , ptf will perform deep 3@xmath12 sr surveys in several narrow - band filters , including h@xmath17 . the resulting sky map will provide an unprecedented high - resolution view on the structure of the diffuse , ionized component of the interstellar medium in the milky way .",
    "this information will be vital for understanding the dynamics and evolutionary history of the interstellar gas .",
    "next , new structures , such as stellar wind bubbles , supernova remnants , bow - shock nebulae , shells around old novae @xcite , and planetary nebula shells with large angular extent are anticipated to be found .",
    "furthermore , we will find low - surface - brightness star - forming galaxies in the local universe , and based on the h@xmath17 emission strength we will be able to estimate the star - formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) of the galaxies within about 40mpc in our survey footprint ( except for galaxies in the zone of avoidance ) .",
    "the palomar transient factory is a wide - field ( 7.9deg@xmath0 ) imaging facility at the palomar 48-inch oschin schmidt telescope , dedicated to mining the optical sky for transients and variables .",
    "its main strengths are the exceptionally large sky coverage to a depth of @xmath21mag and the almost full - time operation ( 80% ) .",
    "nearly real - time discovery of transient candidates will allow rapid follow - up observations with a wide range of committed telescopes , including optical and near - infrared photometry as well as spectroscopy .",
    "ptf is expected to uncover numerous new members of a variety of source populations ( see table  [ tab : transients_rates ] ) , ranging from distant supernovae to nearby cataclysmic .",
    "furthermore , the exploration of new regions in phase space ( e.g. , cadence , environment ) often yields unexpected discoveries .",
    "thus , ptf is poised to provide an important contribution to filling the existing gaps in the transient phase space ( figure  [ fig : magtau ] ) , paving the path for future synoptic surveys , such as lsst .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with the samuel oschin telescope and the 60-inch telescope at the palomar observatory as part of the palomar transient factory project , a scientific collaboration between the california institute of technology , columbia university , las cumbres observatory , the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , the national energy research scientific computing center , the university of oxford , and the weizmann institute of science .",
