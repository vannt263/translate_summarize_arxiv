    "the @xmath7 cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) model has proved to be successful in reproducing structure formation at large scales , but it faces some difficulties at galactic scales . for example , cosmological @xmath0-body simulations predict halos with a central cusp @xcite , whereas observations of the rotation curves of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies indicate that a cored dark halo is preferred @xcite .",
    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are the natural targets to study the properties of dark matter ( dm ) halos at very small masses .",

    "kleyna et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented evidence that the stellar substructure in the ursa minor ( umi ) dwarf spheroidal is incompatible with a cusped dm halo .",
    "they argued that the second peak located on the north - eastern side of the major axis of umi is a disrupted stellar cluster that has survived in phase - space because the underlying gravitational potential is close to harmonic @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dark halo in umi should have a cored mass density profile , instead of a cuspy mass profile as that predicted by the @xmath7cdm model , and that this core should be large @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the clump in umi would be short lived if the dark halo were strongly substructured , but that it can survive for a hubble time in a smooth halo with a large core .",
    "there is also evidence of the existence of stellar kinematically cold substructures in the sextans dsph galaxy .",
    "@xcite found a drop in the stellar velocity dispersion at their innermost data bin , which was interpreted as a dissolving cluster at the sextans center .",
    "later on , @xcite detected a region near sextans core radius that appeared kinematically colder than the overall stellar population of sextans , but they did not detect any signs of a kinematically distinct population at the center of sextans .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the detection of a cold substructure of very metal - poor stars close to the sextans center .",
    "it remains unclear if this substructure is the same as that previously found in @xcite .",

    "sextans is a dsph galaxy satellite of the milky way .",
    "it is located at a galoctocentric distance of @xmath9  kpc @xcite and it has a luminosity of @xmath10  l@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it has a core radius of @xmath12  arcmin ( @xmath13  kpc ) and a tidal radius @xmath14  arcmin ( @xmath15  kpc ) @xcite .",
    "since the majority of the stars in sextans are older than @xmath16  gyr @xcite , @xcite estimated the stellar mass of sextans to be @xmath17  m@xmath11 by integrating the light from a single @xmath18  gyr old stellar population .",

    "assuming an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor and a plummer model for the light distribution in sextans , @xcite inferred that sextans total mass within @xmath21  kpc lies between @xmath22 and @xmath23  m@xmath11 . adopting a nfw profile for the dark halo",
    ", @xcite obtained a dynamical mass of @xmath24m@xmath11 within a radius of @xmath25 pc , whereas @xcite estimated a total mass of @xmath26m@xmath11 , also within the central @xmath25 pc .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported a total mass of @xmath27  m@xmath11 assuming an nfw density profile , which implies a @xmath28 value of @xmath29  ( m / l)@xmath11 .",
    "all these dynamical studies show that sextans is a dm dominated dsph galaxy .    here , we are interested in the existence of putative stellar substructures in sextans .",
    "@xcite reported some evidence for a kinematically and photometrically distinct population at the sextans center .",
    "these authors found that the dispersion at the center of sextans was close to zero , and that such a change in the dispersion profile coincides with a change in the ratio of red horizontal branch stars to blue horizontal branch stars , i.e. in the stellar populations .",
    "they suggested that this is caused by the sinking and gradual dissolution of a stellar cluster at the center of sextans .    in a later work , @xcite presented radial velocities of @xmath30 possible sextans members . their larger data set did not confirm @xcite s ( @xcite ) report of a kinematically distinct stellar population at the center of sextans but they did obtain similar evidence when they restricted their analysis to a similar ( small ) number of stars as used by @xcite . when considering their full radial velocity sample instead , @xcite detected a region near sextans core radius that is kinematically colder than the overall sextans sample , with 95% confidence .",
    "they estimated a substructure luminosity of @xmath31l@xmath11",
    ". we will refer to it as _ substructure a_.    recently , @xcite reported nine old stars that share very similar spatial location , kinematics and metallicities .",
    "the average metallicity of their 9-star group is low ( [ fe / h]@xmath32  dex with a @xmath33 dex scatter ) , consistent with being the remnant of a old stellar cluster .",
    "this group of stars was taken from the six innermost metal - poor stars , which show a cold velocity dispersion of @xmath34  km  s@xmath35 and an average velocity of @xmath36  km  s@xmath35 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the number of stars in this substructure ( nine stars ) is significant with respect to the total number of sextans members for which spectroscopic measurements exist ( @xmath37 stars ) .",
    "this substructure would account for @xmath38% of sextans stellar population , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath39  l@xmath11",
    ". we will refer to it as _ substructure b_.    the present spatial extent of the substructures is very uncertain .",
    "the contours of statistical significance for regions of cold kinematics in walker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that substructure a is centered on a location @xmath40 arcmin north of the sextans center and has a radial size of @xmath41 arcmin ( @xmath29 pc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the nine innermost metal - poor stars that constitute the substructure b are found at @xmath42 @xcite , i.e. at @xmath43  pc from the center of sextans if we assume a distance to sextans of @xmath44  kpc . in @xcite s ( @xcite )",
    "data , there are no metal - poor stars at @xmath45 .",
    "this suggests that the substructure b extends in projected galactocentric radius from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ( i.e. between @xmath48 and @xmath49  pc ) , indicating that , in projection , its center is at @xmath50 pc from the sextans center , and its radius is @xmath51 pc at most .",
    "for our simulations , we constructed a live dm halo with a mass density profile given by @xmath52^{(\\beta-\\gamma/\\alpha ) } } \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the scale radius and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 define the dm halo s slope .",
    "this general density profile equation is very useful to define different density profiles .",
    "for example , a pseudo - isothermal sphere is obtained for @xmath57 and an nfw profile is obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "we explored two different dm radial profiles : a pseudo - isothermal dark halo and an nfw halo .",
    "we adopted the parameters of @xcite for their best - fitting dm mass modeling of sextans , based on their observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile . for a pseudo - isothermal dm halo",
    ", these authors found a core radius @xmath59  kpc , and a mass of @xmath60  m@xmath11 within the last measured point ( @xmath61  kpc , assuming a distance to sextans of @xmath44  kpc ) . in this model ,",
    "the dm mass within a radius of @xmath62 kpc is @xmath26m@xmath11 . for the nfw dm halo , they derived a concentration @xmath63 and a virial mass @xmath64  m@xmath11 , resulting a dm mass within @xmath62 kpc of @xmath65m@xmath11 .",
    "to generate the initial conditions of the dm particles , we used the distribution function proposed by @xcite , assuming an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "the main stellar component in sextans was modeled using the density profile @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total stellar mass and @xmath68 is the scale radius .",
    "we set @xmath69 , assuming a typical value of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath70 .",
    "we took @xmath71 , which corresponds to the dehnen models ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the density declines as @xmath72 at large radii and diverges in the center as @xmath73 .",
    "we used @xmath74 , because it most closely resembles the de vaucouleurs model in surface density .",
    "we took the scale radius for the main stellar component in the sextans galaxy to be @xmath75  kpc ( @xmath76  arcmin , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite conducted an anisotropy study of sextans and found that the general trend for the best - fitting dm mass model is to have a constant anisotropy value close to zero .",
    "thus , the velocity dispersion of the main stellar component was taken to be isotropic .",
    "we performed an @xmath0-body simulation with the dm halo ( cored and nfw ) and the main stellar component together .",
    "each component was found to be stationary for a hubble time ( i.e. , the density profile of the stellar component and its velocity dispersion stayed approximately constant for a hubble time ) .",
    "our starting hypothesis is that the cold substructures in sextans were initially stellar clusters that are now in the process of _ very slow _ dissolution .",
    "the substructures are the gravitationally unbound remnants of the stellar clusters . adopting @xmath77 , typical for an old stellar population ,",
    "the mass in the substructures lies between @xmath78  m@xmath11 for substructure b to @xmath79  m@xmath11 for substructure a , which are reasonable for stellar clusters . in all our runs",
    ", we assumed , for simplicity , a fixed mass of @xmath80m@xmath11 for the initial stellar cluster .",
    "for the initial density profile of the stellar clumps , we used a plummer model , where the mass density profile is given by the following equation : @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we explored different values for the initial core radius @xmath82 between @xmath38 pc , which corresponds to the size of a typical stellar cluster , and @xmath83 pc , which is of the order of the present size of the observed substructures .",
    "simulations with initial core radius of @xmath84 pc are aimed to represent a scenario where the stellar cluster has been caught in the last stage of tidal disruption .",
    "this scenario may present a timing problem because this stage is expected to proceed on a time - scale of one crossing time of the system and , thus , it would be very unlikely to observe them during this phase .",
    "simulations with an initial radius of @xmath85 pc correspond to a situation where the stellar cluster became unbound immediately after formation due to supernova ejection of gas ( goodwin 1997 ) .    without the loss of generality , we set the clumps with an orbit in the @xmath86 plane . since we do not know the orbital parameters of the substructures , we explored different orbits for the clumps around the sextans center .",
    "we only know lower limits for the semimajor axes of the substructures ( it is @xmath87 pc for substructure a and @xmath88 pc for substructure b ) . because projection effects lead to an underestimation of the galactocentric distance of the objects , there is a probability of @xmath89 that the substructure b is at a deprojected distance of @xmath90 pc to sextans center .",
    "therefore , since either substructure a or b or both may be on an orbit with a characteristic radius of @xmath91 pc , we considered orbits with this size .",
    "note that a distance of @xmath92  pc corresponds to the core radius of the main stellar component in sextans ( see section  [ sec : sextans ] ) .",
    "we also considered the limiting case where the galactocentric distance of the clump is @xmath93  pc in order to study a wider range of possible orbits of the clump ; this case is relevant for substructure b. since the substructures are not necessarily on circular orbits ; it is also worthwhile to consider eccentric orbits .      since the internal two - body relaxation timescales for the three components ( clump , main stellar component and halo ) are much larger than a hubble time , sextans can be represented as collisionless @xcite .",
    "we simulated the evolution of the sextans dwarf galaxy ( stellar clump , main stellar component and dm halo ) using the @xmath0-body code @xcite .",
    "is a highly efficient particle - mesh , collisionless - dynamics code with high resolution sub - grids .    in our case ,",
    "uses three nested grids centered on the center of density of the sextans dsph galaxy .",
    "we used @xmath94 cubic cells for each of the grids .",
    "the inner grid is meant to resolve the inner region of sextans and the outer grid ( with radii of @xmath95  kpc for all cases ) resolves the stars that are stripped away from sextans potential . the tidal field created by the milky way was not included .",
    "the spatial resolution is determined by the number of grid cells per dimension ( @xmath96 ) and the grid radius ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "then the side length of one grid cell is defined as @xmath98 . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the resolution is of the order of the typical distance between the particles in the simulation .    integrates the equations of motion with a leap - frog algorithm , and a constant time step @xmath100 .",
    "we selected a time step of @xmath101  myr in our simulations in order to guarantee that the energy ( for the isolated components ) is conserved better than @xmath102 .",
    "our @xmath0-body simulations were carried out from an integration time @xmath103 to @xmath104  gyr .",
    "we used @xmath105 particles to model each of the dm halos , @xmath106 particles to model the main stellar component , and @xmath107 particles to model the stellar clump .",
    "the parameters of our 14 models , from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we first consider the evolution of the clump when it is embedded in a pseudo - isothermal dm halo , having a core radius @xmath59  kpc and a mass within @xmath62  kpc of @xmath110  m@xmath11 ( see section [ sec : dm ] ) . in order to visualize the evolution of the clump in sextans",
    ", we built a map of the surface density ( in units of m@xmath11  pc@xmath111 ) of the stellar clump in the @xmath86-plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the temporal evolution of the mass surface density of the clump in the models @xmath108 ( clump radius @xmath112  pc ) and @xmath113 ( clump radius @xmath5  pc ) for the cored dm halo .",
    "the white circle shows the initial orbit of the stellar clump , and the white cross shows the center of sextans .",
    "model @xmath108 represents a case where the initial clump is very compact ; it resembles the globular clusters found in the fornax dsph galaxy @xcite , which have core radii ranging from @xmath114 to @xmath16  pc . in @xmath108 ,",
    "the stellar cluster remains essentially intact over the duration of the run , @xmath16  gyr ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , because the tidal heating by the parent galaxy s halo is very low .",
    "unbound clumps as extended as the observed substructures ( our model @xmath113 ) also remain essentially unaltered for @xmath16  gyr ( see the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the physical reason is that the underlying potential within the dm core is harmonic and , therefore , the substructure is long - lived even if it is a gravitationally unbound system @xcite .",
    "we also checked that the substructure can persist for a long time if it is dropped on a circular orbit with a radius of @xmath93 pc ( simulation @xmath115 ) .",
    "therefore , we concluded that a dark halo with core radii of @xmath116 kpc may host unbound cold substructures as those observed in sextans .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] show the evolution of the mass surface density of the stellar clump with initial radius @xmath112  pc ( model @xmath117 ) , in a nfw halo with a concentration @xmath63 and a virial mass of @xmath64  m@xmath11 ( see section [ sec : dm ] ) .",
    "for the first @xmath118  gyr , the stellar clump appears almost unperturbed ( see panel @xmath119 of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , but after @xmath38  gyr the orbital phase mixing dissolves it completely and so only a tidal debris can be seen in panel @xmath120 of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] show four snapshots of the substructure when its initial radius is @xmath85 pc ( model @xmath121 ) .",
    "the clump is disrupted in @xmath122 gyr because of the tidal forces by the parent dm halo . since",
    "this time is much shorter than its age ( @xmath123 gyr ) , the substructure is short lived .    at",
    "any given time @xmath124 in the simulation we sample the two - dimensional map searching for the @xmath125  pc size parcel that contains the highest mass ( number of clump particles ) .",
    "we define the destruction time as the time at which the parcel with the highest mass surface density has reached a value of @xmath126  m@xmath11  pc@xmath111 .",
    "when such value is reached , the column density of the clump is so low that it would be indistinguishable from sextans main stellar component , and would thus be undetectable .",
    "in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , we plot the surface density of this parcel as a function of time .",
    "we see that the destruction time is @xmath127  gyr in model @xmath117 and @xmath128  gyr in model @xmath121 .    in model @xmath129",
    ", we reduced the initial size of the clump to a radius @xmath3  pc ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "we found that not even with such a small clump is able to survive for more than @xmath2  gyr .    in order to study the effect of the orbital eccentricity on the destruction time , we ran two simulations ( @xmath130-@xmath131 , see table  [ table:1 ] ) where clump s orbit is non - circular . in model @xmath130",
    ", we set the @xmath38  pc radius clump in a pure radial orbit with apocenter at @xmath91  pc ( see figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "we found that the clump loses its identity in @xmath41 gyr ( figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) . in model @xmath131",
    ", we set the @xmath38  pc radius cluster at a radial distance of @xmath91 pc with a tangential velocity twice the circular velocity at that distance ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , the orbit is eccentric and its pericenter is located at @xmath91 pc . in this case , the clump is disrupted within @xmath2  gyr .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain the existence of cold substructures in sextans at projected distances of @xmath92 pc , as substructure a , if an nfw profile is adopted for its dm halo .    in the case of substructure b ,",
    "its projected distance is uncertain and we can not rule out orbital radii of @xmath133 pc or less . in order to explore if this clump could survive for a significant time , we ran a simulation ( @xmath134 ) where a @xmath38  pc radius cluster is set on a circular orbit with a radius of @xmath93  pc .",
    "in this case , the clump starts to lose particles while it spirals to the center of sextans dm potential due to dynamical friction . at @xmath135  gyr ,",
    "the stellar clump reaches the center of sextans , and it keeps orbiting very close to the center until the end of the simulation ( see figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) . as a consequence , the stellar clump survives as a central star cluster .",
    "it has to be noticed that the dissolution of the clump in this case is similar to model  @xmath129 only during the first @xmath136  gyr .",
    "the evolution of the clump occurs in a similar manner in model @xmath137 , where the orbit of the @xmath38  pc radius clump has its apocenter at @xmath93  pc and its pericenter at @xmath95  pc .",
    "the clump spirals to the center of sextans and loses mass , until the density of the clump decreases by a factor of @xmath138 at @xmath139  gyr ( see figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) . after this time",
    ", the orbital radius of the clump lies between @xmath140 and @xmath141 pc and its dissolution proceeds in a very slowly way .",
    "we conclude that cold substructures having initial orbital radii of @xmath92 pc would not survive in an nfw halo . only substructures with initial orbital radii @xmath142 pc",
    "could survive but they should be located close to the sextans center ( distances @xmath143 pc ) because of the orbital decay due to dynamical friction . since substructure a is at a projected distance of @xmath91 pc , it is difficult to understand how it survived against mixing in an nfw halo .",
    "a more accurate determination of the projected distance of substructure b would be very important to constrain the models further .      it is interesting to explore if the gravitational potential predicted in mond could explain the survival of cold substructures .",
    "to do so , we followed a similar treatment as in @xcite for the umi dsph galaxy . in the mond framework , the gravitational potential that describes the force acting on a star in sextans follows the modified poisson equation of @xcite @xmath144=4 \\pi g \\rho \\mbox { , } \\label{eq : mond}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 , @xmath146  cm  s@xmath111 is the universal acceleration constant of the mond theory , and @xmath147 is the interpolating function , which runs smoothly from @xmath148 at @xmath149 to @xmath150 at @xmath151 .",
    "the differential equation ( [ eq : mond ] ) must be solved with the boundary condition @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the external gravity acting on sextans and has a magnitude @xmath154 .",
    "@xmath155 is the galactic rotational velocity at @xmath156 which coincides with the asymptotic rotation velocity @xmath157 for the milky way .",
    "we set this value to @xmath158  km  s@xmath35 which is obtained by adopting a mass model for the milky way under mond @xcite .",
    "a star in the stellar clump of sextans feels the external acceleration created by the milky way ( denoted by @xmath153 ) , the acceleration generated by sextans smooth stellar component ( @xmath159 ) , and the acceleration generated by all other stars that form the stellar clump ( @xmath160 ) , and thus all must be taken in consideration .    since the circular velocity of a test particle at the stellar core radius ( @xmath161  kpc ) of sextans is @xmath162  km s@xmath35 , then the characteristic internal acceleration @xmath163 ^ 2/r_*\\simeq2.9\\times10^{-10}$ ]  cm s@xmath111",
    "this is much smaller than mond s characteristic acceleration @xmath164  cm s@xmath111 .",
    "moreover , the external acceleration , @xmath165  cm s@xmath111 is also much smaller than @xmath166 .",
    "we can conclude then that the sextans internal dynamics lies deep in the mond regime .",
    "the ratio between the internal acceleration at sextans stellar core radius and the external acceleration ( @xmath167 ) tells us that the dynamics in sextans is dominated by the external field ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "@xcite studied the dsph galaxies of the milky way under mond and compared the results with dm halos . for sextans",
    ", they obtained a high value of ( m / l ) of @xmath169 assuming that the external field is dominant in this galaxy .",
    "@xcite analyzed the line - of - sight velocity dispersion as a function of radius for eight milky way dsph galaxies and calculated the mass - to - light ratio in the mondian regime through a jeans analysis .",
    "he found that sextans requires a rather high mass - to - light ratio of @xmath6 .",
    "we adopted this value here .",
    "we carried out @xmath0-body simulations under the mond approximation with the code described in section [ sec : nbody ] starting with clumps of different radii ( @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath83 pc , which correspond to models @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively ) .",
    "the parameters of the different models are summarized in tables [ table:1 ] and  [ table:1b ] .",
    "the clump survives for more than @xmath16 gyr in the three cases ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the initial stellar clump is extended ( @xmath85 pc ) , it spirals to the center of sextans ; at @xmath104  gyr it orbits within @xmath175  kpc .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .    finally , we ran a simulation ( @xmath109 ) of the @xmath83  pc radius clump in a circular orbit with a galactocentric distance of @xmath93  pc .",
    "also in this case the clump remains undisturbed for @xmath16  gyr . in this case",
    ", the clump also spirals to the center of sextans , and at @xmath104  gyr it orbits within @xmath176  kpc .",
    "using @xmath0-body simulations , we studied the survival of cold kinematic substructures in the dm halo of the sextans dwarf galaxy against phase mixing .",
    "we compared the evolution of substructures when the dark halo has a core and when the dark halo follows the nfw profile , those having the parameters derived by @xcite to explain the projected velocity dispersion profile .",
    "we found that the core in the pseudoisothermal model is large enough to make the potential almost harmonic and , thus , to guarantee the survival of substructures . even if the clump is initially very extended ( @xmath5  pc ) , it easily survives for @xmath16  gyr .",
    "we conclude that the stellar clump in sextans is in agreement with a cored dm halo .    on the contrary ,",
    "stellar clumps orbiting with semi - major axes of @xmath92 pc and initial plummer radii between @xmath18 and @xmath83  pc are destroyed if they are embedded in the nfw dm halo .",
    "not even a stellar clump with a small plummer radius of @xmath3  pc ( model @xmath129 ) can survive in such a nfw dm halo .",
    "stellar clumps initially orbiting at a radius @xmath4 pc from the sextans center spiral to the center due to dynamical friction and , as a consequence , phase mixing is reduced .",
    "clumps in these orbits may survive but would merge forming a central star cluster at the center of sextans .",
    "it has to be noted that we can not rule out a scenario where the dm profile was initially cuspy and evolved to a cored halo .",
    "for instance , energy feedback from supernova explosions and stellar winds , may lead severe gravitational potential fluctuations , which may reduce the central mass density of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that initial cuspy dm profiles flatten with time as a result of star formation , which would explain the observations without contradicting a cuspy dm profile . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show some difficulties with the fine - tuning of the scenarios just mentioned .",
    "@xcite discuss that the transfer of energy from sinking massive objects may destroy central cusps .    as a last point",
    ", we investigated whether or not the clump in sextans could survive in the mondian framework .",
    "we found that even a stellar clump with @xmath5  pc remains undisturbed for a hubble time and slowly spirals to the center of sextans .",
    "however , it has to be noticed that the adopted mond value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath177 , which was derived by @xcite to explain the observed velocity dispersion profile of sextans , is very high and inconsistent with the properties expected from an old purely stellar population .",

    "<S> here we give constraints on the dark halo profile in the sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy by studying the longevity of two cold kinematic substructures detected in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we perform @xmath0-body simulations of a stellar clump in the sextans dwarf galaxy , including a live dark matter halo and the main stellar component . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if the dark halo is cuspy , stellar clumps orbiting with semi - major axis @xmath1 pc are disrupted in @xmath2  gyr , even if the clump is initially as compact stellar cluster with a radius of @xmath3  pc . </S>",
    "<S> stellar clusters in an initial orbit with semi - major axis @xmath4 pc may survive to dissolution but their orbits decay towards the center by dynamical friction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the stellar clumps can persist for a hubble time within a cored dark matter halo , even if the initial clump s radius is as extended as @xmath5  pc . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the evolution of the clump in the mondian context . in this scenario , we find that even an extended stellar clump with radius @xmath5  pc survives for a hubble time , but an unrealistic value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath6 is needed . </S>"
