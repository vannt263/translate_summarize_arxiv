    "the classification of algebras into finite , tame and wild representation type has led to many structural insights in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras .",
    "algebras have finite representation type if there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules . in this case",
    ", the representation theory is usually very well understood and these algebras often serve as first examples or test cases for new ideas and conjectures . to cite but a few examples in this direction see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "all other algebras have infinite representation type , and by @xcite they are either tame or wild .",
    "if an algebra has tame representation type its representation theory usually still exhibits a certain regularity in its structure making calculations and establishing and proving conjectures often possible .",
    "one example of this is the class of brauer graph algebras , which are , depending on their presentation , also known as symmetric special biserial algebras @xcite .",
    "these are tame algebras and much of their representation theory is well - understood , see for example @xcite for a classification of derived equivalence classes , @xcite for their auslander - reiten quiver , @xcite for their covering theory or @xcite for results on their ext algebra .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in brauer graph algebras , stemming from their connection with cluster theory on the one side @xcite and with mutation and derived equivalences on the other side @xcite .",
    "furthermore , brauer graph algebras naturally appear in the derived equivalence classification of self - injective algebras of finite and tame representation type , see @xcite and the references within .",
    "one reason that brauer graph algebras are so well - studied and understood is that the combinatorial data of the underlying brauer graph encodes much of the representation theory of a brauer graph algebra such as for example , projective resolutions @xcite or information on the structure of the auslander - reiten quiver @xcite .    in the general",
    "setting of wild algebras , however , the picture is very different and much less is known or understood . in the cases where we do have some understanding , the wild algebras under consideration",
    "are often endowed with some additional structure such as for example in @xcite where wild blocks of group algebras are considered , or in @xcite , or in @xcite where the algebras have other additional properties .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new class of mostly wild algebras , called _ brauer configuration algebras_. these algebras have additional structure arising from combinatorial data , called a _",
    "brauer configuration_. brauer configuration algebras are a generalization of brauer graph algebras , in the sense that every brauer graph is a brauer configuration and every brauer graph algebra is a brauer configuration algebra .",
    "however , unlike brauer graph algebras , brauer configuration algebras are in general of wild representation type .",
    "but just as the brauer graph encodes the representation theory of brauer graph algebras , the expectation is that the brauer configuration will encode the representation theory of brauer configuration algebras .",
    "as a first step in this direction , we show that the brauer configuration yields the loewy structure of the indecomposable projective modules of a brauer configuration algebra and that the dimension of the algebra can be directly read off the brauer configuration ( proposition  [ prop - dim - result ] ) .",
    "brauer configuration algebras contain another class of well - studied algebras that also have a combinatorial presentation in the form of a finite graph , namely that of symmetric algebras with radical cube zero ( this is shown in @xcite ) .",
    "symmetric algebras with radical cube zero have been well - studied , see for example , @xcite .",
    "the representation type of symmetric algebras with radical cube zero has been classified in terms of the underlying graph in @xcite and for all but a finite number of families they are of wild representation type . in the case of infinite representation type , these algebras are koszul and thus we have some understanding of their representation theory and their cohomology in particular @xcite . in this paper",
    "we classify the brauer configurations such that the associated brauer configuration algebras are _ canonical _ symmetric algebras with radical cube zero .",
    "brauer configuration algebras arise naturally in yet another context ( in a different presentation ) .",
    "namely , almost all representatives of derived equivalence classes of symmetric algebras of finite representation type in the classification by skowronski et al . , see @xcite and the references within , are in fact brauer configuration algebras . those that are not brauer configuration algebras are in fact deformations of brauer graph algebras .    in brauer configuraton algebras ,",
    "similarly to the symmetric special biserial algebras , a path ( of length at least 2 ) is non - zero if and only if it lies in a _",
    "special cycle_. it is a consequence of the existence of the special cycles , that the projective indecomposable modules are such that their heart , given by the quotient of the radical modulo the socle , is a direct sum of uniserial modules ( theorem  [ prop - proj ] ) .    we will now sumarize the most important results in this paper .",
    "a _ brauer configuration _ is a combinatorial data @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of vertices of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a set of multisets of elements of @xmath1 , @xmath4 is a function called the _ multiplicity _ and @xmath5 is called the _ orientation _ of @xmath2 ( see section 1 for the precise definition of a brauer configuration ) . note that by a slight abuse of notation we call the elements in @xmath3 _",
    "polygons_. we denote by @xmath6 the brauer configuration algebra associated to @xmath2 .",

    "* theorem b. * _ let @xmath16 be a brauer configuration algebra with brauer configuration @xmath2 .",

    "* corollary c. * _ a brauer configuration algebra is a multiserial algebra . _    finally we study a bijective correspondence and its consequences between finite graphs , symmetric matrices and ( ordered ) brauer configurations . for this we will restrict ourselves to the case where the brauer configuration has no self - folded polygons , or equivalently to the case where there is no repetition of vertices in the polygons . we classify the brauer configuration algebras with jacobson radical cubed zero in this case : they correspond exactly to the _ canonical _ symmetric algebras with jacobson radical cubed zero .    the paper is outlined as follows . in section  [ section - config ]",
    "we define brauer configurations and in section  [ sec - bca ] brauer configuration algebras .",
    "both sections contain examples to illustrate the newly defined concepts .",
    "section  [ sec - basic ] starts out with the basic properties of brauer configuration algebras , we then define special cycles and use these to show that the projective - injective modules of a brauer configuration algebra are multiserial . in section  [ sec - r30 ] we define canonical symmetric algebras with radical cube zero and relate them to brauer configuration algebras with radical cube zero and show that they correspond to exactly those brauer configuration algebras whose brauer configurations consist of polygons that have no self - foldings .",
    "in this section we define brauer configurations which are generalizations of brauer graphs .",
    "we begin with a tuple @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a ( finite ) set of _ vertices _ of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a finite collection of labeled finite sets of vertices where repetitions are allowed .",
    "that is , @xmath3 is a finite collection of finite labeled multisets whose elements are in @xmath1 .",
    "we provide two examples which we will continue to use throughout the paper to help clarify both definitions and concepts .",
    "example 1 : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "example 2 : @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we abuse notation and call the elements of @xmath3 _ polygons_. the use of the term ` polygon ' will become clear when we discuss realizations of configurations in section  [ subsectionrealizations ] .",
    "we call the elements of a polygon @xmath25 the _ vertices of @xmath25_. if @xmath25 is a polygon in @xmath3 and @xmath26 is a vertex in @xmath1 , define @xmath27 to be the number of times @xmath26 occurs as a vertex in @xmath25 and define the _ valence _ of @xmath26 , @xmath28 , to be @xmath29 .    in the first example above",
    ", we have @xmath30 , etc and @xmath31 and @xmath32 , etc .",
    "+ in the second example , we have @xmath33 , etc . and @xmath34 and @xmath32 , etc .",
    "for @xmath35 to be a brauer configuration , we need two more pieces of information .",
    "one is a _ multiplicity function _",
    "@xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the strictly positive integers .",
    "the other is an _ orientation _",
    "@xmath38 for @xmath2 .    in the first example",
    ", we choose @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for all other vertices . in the second example , we choose @xmath41 for all vertices @xmath42 .",
    "of course , there are many other choices for the multiplicity function than the arbitrary ones given here .",
    "an _ orientation for @xmath2 _ is a choice , for each vertex @xmath43 , of a cyclic ordering of the polygons in which @xmath26 occurs as a vertex , including repetitions .",
    "more precisely , for each vertex @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the list of polygons in which @xmath26 occurs as a vertex , with a polygon @xmath25 occuring @xmath27 times in the list , that is @xmath25 occurs the number of times @xmath26 occurs as a vertex in @xmath25 .",
    "the cyclic order at vertex @xmath26 is obtained by linearly ordering the list , say @xmath46 and by adding @xmath47 .",
    "finally , note that if @xmath48 is the chosen cyclic ordering at vertex @xmath26 , then the same ordering can be represented by any cyclic permutation such as @xmath49 or @xmath50 , etc .",
    "[ ex - order ]    in the first example , the list of polygons ocuring at vertex 1 is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 at vertex 2 , @xmath53 at vertex 3 , @xmath54 at vertex 4 , @xmath55 at vertex 5 , @xmath56 at vertex 6 , @xmath57 at vertex 7 , and @xmath58 at vertex 8 . in the second example , the list of polygons ocuring at vertex 1 is @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are the three ocurrences of vertex @xmath62 in @xmath57 , etc .",
    "an orientation is then given by cyclically ordering the lists of polygons at each vertex .",
    "thus , for the first example , one orientation would be : @xmath63 at vertex 1 , @xmath64 at vertex 2 , @xmath64 at vertex 3 , @xmath65 at vertex 4 , @xmath55 at vertex 5 , @xmath56 at vertex 6 , @xmath57 at vertex 7 , and @xmath58 at vertex 8 .",
    "note that for vertices 2,4,5,6,7,8 there is only one choice for cyclic ordering . on the other hand , there are 2 choices for the cyclic ordering at vertex 1 and 3 ! choices at vertex 4 . for later use",
    ", we call the orientation given above @xmath66 and let @xmath67 be the orientation with orderings @xmath68 at vertex 1 and @xmath69 at vertex 4 . for the remainder of the paper , unless otherwise stated , we will use the orientation @xmath66 when referring to example 1 .    in the second example , let @xmath70 be the orientation given by the orderings @xmath71 at vertex 1 , @xmath72 at vertex 2 , and @xmath73 at vertex 3 .",
    "there are many other choices of orientations for this example and they are typically associated to non - isomorphic brauer configuration algebras .    [ bc ]    a _ brauer configuration _ is a tuple @xmath74 , where @xmath1 is a set of vertices , @xmath3 is a set of polygons , @xmath4 is a multiplicity function , and @xmath38 is an orientation , such that the following conditions hold .    1 .",

    "every polygon in @xmath3 has at least one vertex @xmath26 such that @xmath75 .",
    "note that if @xmath25 and @xmath76 are two distinct polygons in @xmath3 , it is possible that @xmath25 and @xmath76 have identical sets of vertices .",
    "we distinguish between the two using their labels @xmath25 and @xmath76 .",
    "also note that @xmath77 with @xmath78 violates c3 and hence is not a brauer configuration .",
    "however , by convention this algebra usually is nevertheless consider to be a brauer graph algebra and is isomorphic to the truncated polynomial algebra @xmath79/(x^2)$ ] .",
    "our next goal is to show that a brauer configuration is the union of connected brauer configurations .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath80 be a brauer configuration .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ disconnected _ if there are two brauer configurations @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath83 is a partition of @xmath1 , 2 .   for every polygon @xmath84 ,",
    "the vertices of @xmath25 are either all in @xmath85 or are all in @xmath86 , 3 .",
    "@xmath87 constitutes a partition of @xmath3 , 4 .",
    "@xmath88 ( resp .",

    "@xmath91 ) , and 5 .   the orientations @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "are induced by @xmath5 .    in this case , we write @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath2 is connected _ if it is not disconnected .",
    "it is clear that any brauer configuration can be uniquely written as a union of connected brauer configurations .",
    "we call these connected brauer configurations the _ connected components of @xmath2_.    we say a polygon in a brauer configuration  is _ self - folded _ if there is at least one vertex which occurs more than once in @xmath25 .",
    "see the section below on realizations for a justification of the terminology .",
    "[ bga ] a connected brauer configuration , all of whose polygons are 2-gons is a brauer graph and a self - folded 2-gon is a loop . for the definition of brauer graphs and brauer graph algebras ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite , for a definition in terms of ribbon graphs , see @xcite or for a presentation more closely related to the present paper , see @xcite .",
    "it is very useful to visualize a brauer configuration @xmath95 . for this , one represents each polygon in @xmath3 by an actual polygon .",
    "that is given a polygon ( or multiset ) @xmath96 in @xmath3 , @xmath25 is visualized by an actual @xmath97-gon with vertices labeled by the @xmath98 .",
    "although there usually are many ways to perform the vertex labeling , just one is chosen .",
    "in particular , the order in which one labels the vertices of the actual polygon is not important .",
    "if a vertex @xmath43 occurs more than once in @xmath25 , that is , @xmath25 is self - folded , we identify all vertices labeled @xmath26 in the actual polygon @xmath25 . finally , we identify vertices of different polygons if they correspond to the same vertex in @xmath1 .",
    "we call such a choice , a _ realization of the configuration @xmath2_. the actual theory and proofs in this paper never refer to or use any realization , however in terms of visualizing and understanding the results and proofs , realizations of configurations are a useful tool .",
    "we provide two realizations of the first example given above .",
    "here is the first realization .",
    "note that the vertices in the polygon @xmath57 are ` ordered ' 1,2,3,4,7 and in the 5-gon representing @xmath57 , 1 is adjacent to 2 , 2 is adjacent to 3 , etc . if we change the order in which vertices occur , we will , in general , change the realization .",
    "for example , in the first example , if instead , we ordered the vertices 1,3,4,2,7 in the realization , we would obtain the following brauer configuration .",
    "we note that these are two different realizations of the same brauer configuration  and that the first realization is embeddable in the plane but the second is not .",
    "below is a realization of @xmath99 , the second example , in which there are a number of self - foldings .",
    "we now define the crucial concept of a truncated vertex in a brauer configuration @xmath100 .",
    "we say a vertex @xmath43 is _ truncated _ if @xmath101 ; that is , @xmath26 occurs exactly once in exactly one @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "a vertex that is not truncated is called a _ nontruncated vertex_.    in the first example , vertices 6,7 , and 8 are truncated .",
    "note that vertex 5 is not truncated , even though @xmath104 , since @xmath105 . in the second example",
    ", vertex 4 is truncated .",
    "we will see in what follows that a truncated vertex only plays a role if it is one of the two vertices of a 2-gon .",
    "namely , we introduce a reduction procedure which removes truncated vertices from polygons with 3 or more vertices .",
    "this will not affect the associated brauer configuration algebra defined in section [ sec - bca ] , see proposition [ prop - red ] .",
    "the reduction procedure for removing a truncated vertex occurring in a @xmath97-gon , @xmath106 is defined as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath107 is a brauer configuration and that @xmath44 is a truncated vertex in a @xmath97-gon @xmath102 with @xmath106 .",
    "note that since @xmath26 is truncated , @xmath108 and this implies that @xmath25 is the unique polygon in @xmath3 having @xmath26 as a vertex . after reordering the vertices in @xmath25 , we may assume that @xmath25 is the @xmath97-gon @xmath109 , with @xmath110 .",

    "@xmath115 , 4 .",
    "@xmath117 is the orientation induced from the orientation @xmath38 .",
    "we see that @xmath118 is simply obtained from @xmath2 by `` removing '' the truncated vertex @xmath26 from @xmath25 .",
    "note that the number of polygons in @xmath2 and @xmath118 are the same and only one polygon in @xmath118 has one less vertex .",
    "if @xmath118 also has a truncated vertex in a @xmath119-gon , with @xmath120 , we can remove it and obtain a brauer configuration @xmath121 , where @xmath121 has 2 less vertices than @xmath2 .",
    "continuing in this fashion , we arrive at a brauer configuration @xmath122 in which , if @xmath26 is a truncated vertex , it occurs in a @xmath123-gon and hence there are no more reductions that can be performed in @xmath122 .",
    "we call @xmath122 a _ reduced brauer configuration associated to @xmath2_. if @xmath124 we say that @xmath2 is a _ reduced _ brauer configuration .",
    "we leave the proof of the next result to the reader .    [",
    "reduced ] let @xmath2 be a brauer configuration and suppose that @xmath122 and @xmath125 are two reduced configurations associated to @xmath2 . then we may choose a relabeling of the vertices of   @xmath125 so that @xmath126 .",
    "the above lemma allows us to talk about ` the ' reduced configuration associated to a brauer configuration .    in the first example , the reduced configuration is obtained by removing vertices 7 and 8 .",
    "note that although vertex 6 is truncated , it is in the 2-gon @xmath56 . in the second example , the reduced configuration is obtained by removing vertex 4 .",
    "realizations of the reduced brauer configurations for these two examples are given below .",

    "we call such a cyclically ordered list the _ successor sequence at @xmath26_. suppose that @xmath127 is the successor sequence at some nontruncated vertex @xmath26 ( with @xmath128 ) .",
