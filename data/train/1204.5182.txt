    "the reason for the limitation of the atlas searches on the squeezed spectrum is two - fold .",
    "first , when @xmath18 is small compared to the neutralino mass , the momentum of @xmath19 in the rest frame of @xmath20 is @xmath18 after neglecting the bottom quark mass @xmath17 . if there is no additional jet to boost the two-@xmath20 system in the transverse direction , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",

    "a large mass splitting is required .",
    "similar arguments hold for the momenta of two @xmath0 s . in the rest frame of @xmath20 ,",
    "the momentum of @xmath0 is around @xmath18 . to passing the stringent cut with @xmath8  gev ,",
    "one basically requires to have @xmath23  gev if the sbottoms are not moving too fast in the center of mass frame and there is no additional jets to boost sbottoms in the transverse direction .",
    "the story changes if there is an additional isr jet with a large transverse momentum .",
    "the two-@xmath20 system turns to move in the transverse direction opposite to the isr jet , as depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : isr ] . for an isr jet with a transverse momentum @xmath24 and for a small mass",
    "splitting @xmath18 , the sum of neutralino s transverse momenta is around @xmath25 and hence can pass a stringent cut on the missing transverse momentum .",
    "for the two @xmath0 s in the final state , one can have the leading @xmath0-jet with a transverse momentum as large as @xmath26 if one sbottom does not move in the transverse direction , and the summation of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be @xmath29 . at hadron colliders ,",
    "the pair - produced sbottoms also have non - negligible velocities in the transverse direction . as a result",
    ", the @xmath0 jets produced from sbottom decays can easily pass the minimum kinematic requirement like @xmath30  gev . however , it is very rare to pass the very stringent cut like @xmath8  gev , imposed in the current atlas search  @xcite , for the squeezed spectrum .",
    "so , we propose a new search strategy to cover the squeezed mass spectra with a small value of @xmath18 by requiring the following three basic objects in the final state :    _ one energetic non @xmath0-tagged jet from the initial state radiation .",
    "_    _ a large transverse missing energy .",

    "the physics is more complicated but also interesting .",
    "when the mass splitting is reduced to be close but above the lightest @xmath73-hadron mass around 5.3 gev , we anticipate that sbottom should decay into neutralino plus a single @xmath73-hadron . with the boost of the isr jet , the signature of this region of parameter space should be one isr jet , a large missing transverse momentum plus two single @xmath73-hadrons .",
    "the single @xmath73-hadron jet is different from the ordinary @xmath0-jet from qcd and can be tagged using a method beyond the standard @xmath0-jet tagging algorithm by requiring less tracks for the @xmath0-tagged jet . for the mass splitting below the mass of the lightest @xmath73-hadron , sbottom should have a multi - body decay into lighter hadrons plus neutralino .",
    "for the parameter region with a large @xmath63 and also a large @xmath18 , one may think about studying the single sbottom production in association with a neutralino as @xmath94 .",
    "one may gain some production cross section by only producing one heavy particle in the final state .",
    "the final state is a mono-@xmath0 jet plus missing transverse energy .",
    "however , comparing to the pair - production of @xmath20 , two additional reduction factors make the single sbottom production cross section very small .",
    "one is the small coupling among @xmath0-quark , @xmath20 and @xmath1 in comparison with the qcd coupling .",
    "the other one is the smallness of the fraction of the @xmath0-parton inside the proton .",
    "we have checked that the ratio of the single sbottom production cross section over the pair - production one is around @xmath95 to @xmath96 for @xmath63 from 600  gev to 1  tev , with a fixed the neutralino mass as 100 gev .    in summary ,",
    "we have proposed a new search strategy to cover the squeezed spectrum with a small mass difference between sbottom and neutralino .",
    "the general search strategy of our proposal requires one hard isr jet , one or two @xmath0-jets with a medium value of @xmath5 s and a large transverse missing energy . to further improve the search limit , we have found several useful variables including the azimuthal angle difference between the leading @xmath0-jet and @xmath97 and the top quark transverse mass @xmath58 , defined in terms of a @xmath0-jet and the missing @xmath61 for the @xmath34 background . with a 20 fb@xmath4 luminosity at the 8 tev lhc",
    ", we have found that our new search strategy can cover a wide range of parameter space with @xmath98  gev that would have not been covered by extending previous analysis . for a very small mass splitting with @xmath87  gev",
    ", we have found that the sbottom with a mass up to 400 gev can be excluded at 95% c.l .. using the previous analysis strategy by requiring two hard @xmath0-jets , we estimate the reach for the sbottom mass to be around 600 gev for @xmath99  gev .",
