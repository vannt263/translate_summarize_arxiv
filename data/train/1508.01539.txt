    ", the above condition says that as we approach infinity the  size of the holes of @xmath24 is not becoming arbitrary small and furthermore they are not getting arbitrary close to each other .",
    "2 .   we would like to mention here that nguyen @xcite constructed examples of complete embedded translating solitons in the euclidean space @xmath0 with infinite genus . outside a cylinder , these examples look like a family of parallel half - planes .",
    "this means that the hypothesis about the number of half - planes is sharp .",
    "very recently , dvila , del pino & nguyen @xcite and , independently , smith @xcite constructed examples of complete embedded translators with finite non - trivial topology . for an exposition of examples of translators",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "ilmanen constructed a one - parameter family of complete convex translators , defined on strips , connecting the grim reaper cylinder with the bowl soliton @xcite .",
    "note that the level sets of these translators are closed curves .",
    "this means that our hypothesis of being asymptotic to two planes outside a cylinder is natural and can not be removed .",
    "let us describe now the general idea and the steps of the proof .",
    "as already mentioned , we will assume that @xmath17 .",
    "without loss of generality we can choose the @xmath52-axis as the axis of rotation of @xmath33 .",
    "first we show that the half - planes must be parallel to each other , they should be also parallel to the translating direction and that both wings of @xmath24 outside the cylinder must point in the direction of @xmath7 . then , after a translation in the direction of the @xmath53-axis , if necessary , we prove that the asymptotic half - planes @xmath31 and @xmath32 are subsets of the parallel planes @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , and that @xmath24 is contained in the slab between the planes @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "to prove this claim we study the @xmath53-coordinate function of @xmath24 in order to control its range . by the strong maximum principle",
    "we conclude that the @xmath53-coordinate function can not attain local maxima or minima . to prove that @xmath58 we perform a  blow - down \" argument based on a compactness theorem of white @xcite for sequences of properly embedded minimal surfaces in riemannian @xmath59-manifolds .",
    "the next step is to show that @xmath24 is a bi - graph over @xmath57 and that the plane @xmath60 is a plane of symmetry for @xmath24 . to prove this claim we use alexandrov s method of moving planes . in the sequel",
    "we show that @xmath24 must be a graph over a slab of the @xmath61-plane .",
    "thus , @xmath24 must have zero genus and it must be strictly mean convex . to achieve this goal we carefully investigate the set of the local maxima and minima of the profile curve @xmath62 performing again a  blow - down \" argument along the ends of the curve @xmath63 we deduce that @xmath24 looks like a grim reaper cylinder at infinity .",
    "to finish the proof , we consider the function @xmath64 which measures the @xmath52-coordinate of the gau map @xmath9 of @xmath24 .",
    "then , by applying the strong maximum principle to @xmath65 , we deduce that @xmath64 is identically zero .",
