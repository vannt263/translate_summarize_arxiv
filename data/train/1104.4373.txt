    "two of the most intriguing aspects of quantum field theory are the chiral anomaly , which refers to the the quantum mechanical breaking of the chiral symmetry@xcite , and the charge fractionalization , which refers to the fact that fractional fermion numbers can be induced by topologically nontrivial background configurations such as kinks or solitons@xcite . since both the chiral anomaly and the charge fractionalization can be understood from the viewpoint of dirac s negative energy sea@xcite , it is perhaps not surprising that a tighter connection between these two phenomena can be made@xcite .",
    "for example , schaposnik@xcite showed that , in a commonly used 1 + 1-dimensional model , the fermion current receives a contribution from the nontrivial jacobian factor associated with a chiral rotation of the fermionic field .",
    "this contribution leads directly to charge fractionalization .",
    "schaposnik s analysis was inspired by fujikawa s observation@xcite that the chiral anomaly owes its existence to the nontrivial jacobian associated with the chiral transformation in the path integral .",
    "therefore , the nontrivial chiral jacobian links together the chiral anomaly and the fractional fermion number .",
    "this connection between the chiral anomaly and the induced fractional fermion number raise the question : how can the chiral jacobian and hence the chiral anomaly be temperature independent@xcite while the fractional fermion number is affected by temperature@xcite ?",
    "this question is very much like the problem of how the amplitude for @xmath0 , which is deeply related to the chiral anomaly , is affected by temperature in the face of the temperature independence of the coefficient of the chiral anomaly@xcite . here",
    ", we present a study of this question .",
    "we show , in the field theoretic model studied by shaposnik , how the fractional fermion number acquires a negative temperature - dependent contribution , which eventually cancels exactly the anomaly contribution at infinite temperature at one - loop order . we have been aided by a previous study@xcite of the massive schwinger model in obtaining this result .",
    "the results presented here are consistent with previous studies on induced fermion numbers at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "our aim is to show that although the chiral anomaly and the fractional fermion number share a common origin they are ultimately very different due to their different finite temperature behaviors .    with slight modifications ,",
    "our analysis can be immediately applied to the study of the induced chern - simons term in 2 + 1-dimensional qed at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the induced chern - simons term is related to the chiral anomaly in a way very similar to the relation between the induced fermion number and the chiral anomaly@xcite .",
    "we will show in our approach that the coefficient of induced chern - simons term vanishes in the so - called long wavelength limit at infinite temperature , consistent with previous studies .",

    ". the current @xmath38 in the massive schwinger model will only contain derivative terms of @xmath39 and therefore does not contribute to the induced fermion number . but @xmath38 will play an important role at finite temperature as is shown in the next section .",
    "to see how the induced fermion number obtained in the previous section changes with temperature , we need to calculate vacuum polarization tensor of the massive schwinger model at finite temperature . to one loop - order , the vacuum polarization tensor at finite temperature is given by @xmath40 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be written as@xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the zero - temperature part , and @xmath44 is the temperature - dependent part .",
    "as there is a fermion mass gap , the zero - temperature part @xmath43 does not contain a @xmath45-pole term and therefore could not contribute to the @xmath39 term as mentioned above .",

    "we can see that @xmath58 decreases from 1 at zero temperature to zero at infinite temperature .",
    "therefore , the induced fermion number ( obtained by integrating @xmath35 over @xmath36 ) will decrease when temperature increases and vanish completely at infinite temperature .    in comparison with earlier results , we give the following low- and high - temperature limits of eq .",

    "therefore , while the general strategy we employ is the same as that of fosco , rossini , and schaposnik@xcite , our result also nicely complements theirs .",
