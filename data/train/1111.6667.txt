    "the dynamics of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) outflows depends on the density distribution of the ambient medium as well as on the structure of the relativistic expanding ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "up to the deceleration epoch , where most of the energy is transferred to the shocked external medium , the dynamics is regulated by the local radial structure of the ejecta , while at later times ( as the blastwave decelerates ) it mainly depends on its global angular structure . in the absence of characteristic scales ,",
    "self - similar , spherically symmetric solutions exist ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter blandford - mckee ) and they are widely used to interpret observational data on grb afterglows . however , even the simplest departure from this ideal model could drastically modify the afterglow behavior .",
    "anisotropies in the grb outflow , for example , affect the afterglow light curve when the mean jet energy per solid angle within the visible region evolves significantly . as the jet decelerates , the relativistic beaming weakens and the visible region increases .",
    "if the outflow is collimated into a narrow jet with reasonably sharp edges , this occurs at the time when the bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 equals the inverse of jet half - opening angle @xmath14 .",
    "a simple analytic calculation using the usual scaling laws leads then to a steepening of the afterglow flux decay rate , known as a _ jet break _",
    "@xcite . it is however clear from numerical studies that such simple scalings do not provide an accurate description of the afterglow  .",
    "such numerical studies have so far been limited to the case of a uniform external density while the interaction of relativistic grb jets with a non - uniform medium remains poorly understood .    motivated by this , here we study the dynamics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) axially symmetric impulsive jets propagating in a spherically symmetric stratified medium of rest - mass density @xmath15 and the resulting afterglow emission . since long duration grbs have massive star progenitors whose winds are expected to modify their immediate surroundings  , we consider both steady and time varying stellar winds as possible surrounding or external media for the grb jet evolution .",
    "the case @xmath12 corresponds to a stellar wind for a massive star progenitor  @xcite with a constant ratio of its pre - explosion mass loss rate @xmath16 and wind velocity @xmath17 , in which case @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "however , since the dependence of @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the time @xmath20 before the stellar explosion that triggers the grb is highly uncertain , it is worth considering other values of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 then the location of a wind element at the time of the explosion is @xmath23 so that @xmath24 and we have @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for a constant wind velocity ( @xmath28 ) this gives @xmath29 , which corresponds to @xmath12 for @xmath30 ( constant wind mass flux ) and @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( linearly increasing mass flux with time ) .",

    "to study the dynamics of a grb jet propagating in a stratified external medium , we carry out a set of two - dimensional simulations using the special relativistic hydrodynamic ( srhd ) version of the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code _ mezcal _ @xcite .",

    "the flux at the same observed time @xmath184 is dominated by larger lab frame times @xmath157 .",
    "the spectra at different observer times are shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "for all values of @xmath7 , the spectra evolves from a fast cooling ( with @xmath185 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 for @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 respectively ) to a slow cooling regime ( with @xmath192 and @xmath186 , @xmath193 , @xmath188 for @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 respectively ) .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath197 quickly drops with time with an asymptotic slope of @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 for @xmath105 respectively , ( while one expects @xmath201 , which is relatively closed to our result ) , while @xmath202 increases at late times as @xmath203 , that is , with a slope independent on the particular stratification of the ambient medium ( for comparison , in the sedov - taylor regime one expects @xmath204 ) . as shown in ",
    "[ dynamics ] , a jet moving in a stratified medium ( with @xmath31 and @xmath12 ) decelerates to sub - relativistic speed over larger distances with respect to a jet moving in an homogeneous medium ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the consequences of it on the light curve are particularly evident at radio frequencies ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) , where the contribution from mildly- and sub - relativistic material is negligible in the @xmath12 case and dominant in the @xmath4 up to @xmath205  days .",
    "figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] show a pan - chromatic dip or flattening in the lightcurves at around half a day for @xmath206 , a third of a day for @xmath207 and significantly earlier for @xmath9 .",
    "this feature is also seen in figure  [ fig10 ] , which shows the temporal index @xmath208 as a function of @xmath184 , where the earliest value of @xmath209 is larger than expected analytically for a spherical flow ( or for a jet viewed along its axis , before the jet break time ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] clearly illustrates the reason for this behavior .",
    "it basically occurs at the point where the dominant contribution to the observed flux switches from the blandford - mckee wedge with @xmath210 to the simulation , which corresponds to later lab - frame times .",
    "as pointed out and calculated in @xcite for the spherical case , the relaxation of the mapping of the analytic blandford - mckee self - similar solution to the numerical solution and the finite resolution of the simulation result in a dip in the lorentz factor that is gradually recovered as the shocked region becomes wider and thus better resolved with time .",
    "this produces a dip in the lightcurve , that gradually goes away as the resolution of the simulation is increased ( see figures 5 , 6 , 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is a numerical artifact of the finite resolution of the simulation .",
    "similar errors in the light curves were also present in previous simulations for the @xmath4 case ( e.g. , our light curve in the case @xmath4 is nearly identical to that by @xcite as depicted in @xcite ) .",
    "a smaller contribution ( although not easily quantifiable ) to the pan - chromatic dip in the lightcurve is due to the particular initial conditions chosen in this paper .",
    "in fact , as the jet initially has sharp edges ( a step function in the @xmath106-direction ) , once the simulation starts there is a relaxation period occurring in the lateral direction on a dynamical timescale ( as a rarefaction wave propagates from the edge of the jet towards its center ) .",
    "this lateral transient phase triggered by the sharp - edged jet is also imprinted in the lightcurves around the time of the dip or flattening , and , contrary to the limited resolution artifacts , is not expected to go away as the resolution is increased .",
    "this artifact might be less pronounced for initial conditions that are smoother in the lateral direction ( e.g. , a jet with an initial gaussian angular profile ) .    apart from this early - time , artificial feature , there is the expected pan - chromatic jet break that is present at all frequencies above @xmath197 and is observed between a day for @xmath9 to several days for @xmath206 .",

    "we shall first discuss the pan - chromatic jet break features at frequencies that are above the typical synchrotron frequency at the time of the jet break , @xmath213 .",

    ". the relatively sharper jet break ( compared to analytic expectations ) in a stratified medium may permit the detection of such a jet break .",

    "* ) . after this overshoot @xmath209 gradually decreases , and there is also a noticeable curvature in the lightcurve as the flow becomes mildly relativistic and eventually approaches the newtonian regime .",
    "the effects of electron cooling on the shape of the jet break appear to be rather modest in most cases .    at low frequencies ,",
    "@xmath215 ( see figure [ fig10 ] , upper panel ) , there is only a very modest increase in @xmath209 near @xmath216 . on the other hand , when the break frequency @xmath197 sweeps past the observed frequency @xmath217 , a very sharp break is seen ( i.e. increase in @xmath209 ) .",

    "most of the steepening occurs within a factor of @xmath230 in time for @xmath1 while for @xmath231 it takes @xmath232 decades for @xmath233 .",
    "this is particularly interesting because previous analytical work have argued that the effect of varying @xmath7 should be significantly larger .",
    "it can also be seen in figure  [ fig12 ] that the jet induced steepening starts earlier and ends later for larger @xmath7-values and for larger viewing angles ( or @xmath234 values ) . also , the overshoot in the value of @xmath209 is larger for greater @xmath7-values or @xmath235 values .",

    "as expected , the lightcurves computed from a spherical blast wave with the same isotropic energy and from the two dimensional simulation match reasonably well at early times . for the double - sided jet , it can be seen that the bump in the lightcurve near the non - relativistic transition time , caused because the counter - jet ( whose contribution is indicated by a _ dashed line _ ) becomes visible , is much more prominent for low values of @xmath7 and becomes significantly more modest for larger @xmath7-values .",
    "this effect is caused by the more gradual deceleration of the jet for larger @xmath7-values ( as the same mass of external medium is swept - up over a larger range in radii ) , which causes the counter - jet to become visible more gradually , resulting in a wider , lower peak flux bump . in particular , for @xmath12 it amounts to a fairly modest and rather slow flattening of the lightcurve , which might be hard to discern observationally .",
    "this might , however , not help explain the lack of a clear flattening or rebrightening in the late radio afterglow of grb  030329  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since in that case detailed afterglow modeling favors a uniform external density  ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of the radio flux at late times from a double - sided jet and from a spherical blast wave with the same true energy near the non - relativistic transition time shows that they are broadly similar but may differ by up to a factor @xmath265 . for @xmath206 and @xmath207 the spherical analog slightly over - predicts the flux before the contribution from the counter jet becomes important , and under - predicts the flux once the emission from the counter - jet becomes dominant , while for @xmath9 the spherical analogue consistently under - predicts the flux , by up to a factor of @xmath265 .",
    "this may result in an small but not negligible error in the estimation of the true energy in the double - side jet assuming a spherical sub - relativistic flow , as is commonly done in radio calorimetry studies @xcite , both over- or under- estimating the real true energy depending on the stratification of the ambient medium and the observer time ) .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of grb jets during the afterglow stage as they propagate into different external density profiles , @xmath266 for @xmath267 , using detailed hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our main results , which relate both to the dynamics and the resulting afterglow emission , can be summarized as follows .    for the same initial half - opening angle @xmath14 and external density at the jet break radius ( which is defined by @xmath268 ) ,",
    "the lateral spreading is initially ( at @xmath269 ) larger for higher @xmath7-values .",
    "this arises because at the same radius ( or lab frame time ) the typical lorentz factor is lower . at late times",
    "( @xmath270 ) the situation is reversed , and the effective jet opening angle at a fixed lab frame time is similar for different @xmath7-values . since for higher @xmath7-values a larger range of radii is required in order to sweep - up the same amount of mass , the whole evolution extends over a much wider range of radii and times . as a result ,",
    "the jet break in the afterglow lightcurve is smoother and more gradual , the non - relativistic transition occurs later , and the flow approaches spherical symmetry more slowly and over longer timescales . the effective jet opening angle is observed to increase only logarithmically with lab frame time ( or radius ) once the jet comes into lateral causal contact ( i.e. when @xmath5 drops below @xmath6 ) .",
    "as long as the jet is relativistic , most of the energy and emission are concentrated near the head of the jet while the slower material at the edges carries relatively little energy ( even though it carries a substantial fraction of the swept - up rest - mass ) .",
    "this holds true for all @xmath7-values .",
    "once the jet becomes sub - relativistic , at @xmath271 , it quickly spreads laterally and swiftly starts to approach spherical symmetry .",
    "the energy weighted mean value of @xmath115 is observed to be of order unity at @xmath272 rather than at @xmath273 , as one might naively expect .",
    "we find that there is little @xmath7-dependence on the temporal evolution of @xmath138 , so that irrespective of the external medium radial profile , all of the expanding jets approach spherical symmetry at similar times ( @xmath274 decades after @xmath121 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached from the calculated evolution of @xmath275 with @xmath276 .",
    "we find that contrary to the expectations of analytic models , the shape of the jet break is affected more by the viewing angle ( within the initial jet aperture , @xmath237 ) than by the steepness of the external density profile ( for @xmath277 ) .",
    "larger viewing angles result in a later jet break time and a smoother jet break , extending over a wide range in time , and with a larger overshoot ( initial increase in the temporal decay index @xmath209 beyond its asymptotic value ) , which is observed to be more prominent for lower @xmath7-values .",
    "larger @xmath7-values result in more gradual jet breaks , but the sharpness of the jet break is affected even slightly more by the viewing angle as argued above .",
    "the counter - jet becomes visible around @xmath278 , and for @xmath4 this results in a clear bump in the light curve .",
    "however , for larger @xmath7-values the jet deceleration is more gradual and as a result a wider and lower bump is produced , which becomes hard to detect for @xmath12 , where it reduces to a mild flattening in the light curve .",
    "this may explain the lack of a clear counter - jet signature in some late time radio afterglow light curves of long duration grbs although the dynamical complexity of their surrounding circumburst medium seriously limits the validity of a non - evolving power - law density profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we showed that the use of a spherical blast wave for estimating the total energy of the jet , as is commonly done in radio calorimetry studies , results in an error in the estimation of the true energy content of the jet that depends on the stratification of the ambient medium ( being on average larger for @xmath12 ) .",
    "in particular , in the case @xmath12 , the spherical blast wave analogy consistently overestimates the true energy , while for the cases @xmath4 and @xmath31 it produces and under- or an over - estimate depending on whether the estimation of the jet energy is done before or after the non - relativistic transition time .",
