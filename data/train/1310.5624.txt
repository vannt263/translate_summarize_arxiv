    "the development of internet led to emergence of various types of complex directed networks created by modern society . the size of such networks grows rapidly going beyond ten billions in last two decades for the world wide web ( www ) .",
    "thus the development of mathematical tools for the statistical analysis of such networks becomes of primary importance . in 1998 ,",
    "brin and page proposed the analysis of www on the basis of pagerank vector of the associated google matrix constructed for a directed network @xcite .",
    "the mathematical foundations of this analysis are based on markov chains @xcite and perron - frobenius operators @xcite .",
    "the pagerank algorithm allows to compute the ranking of network nodes and is known to be at the heart of modern search engines @xcite .",
    "however , in many respects the statement of brin and page that _",
    "`` despite the importance of large - scale search engines on the web , very little academic research has been done on them '' _",
    "@xcite still remains valid at present . in our opinion , this is related to the fact that the google matrix @xmath2 belongs to a new class of operators which had been rarely studied in physical systems .",
    "indeed , the physical systems are usually described by hermitian or unitary matrices for which the random matrix theory @xcite captures many universal properties .",
    "in contrast , the perron - frobenium operators and google matrix have eigenvalues distributed in the complex plane belonging to another class of operators .",
    "the google matrix is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath3 which has unit elements if there is a link pointing from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 and zero otherwise",
    ". then the matrix of markov transitions is constructed by normalizing elements of each column to unity ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and replacing columns with only zero elements ( _ dangling nodes _ ) by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the matrix size .",
    "after that the google matrix of the network takes the form @xcite : @xmath10 the damping parameter @xmath11 in the www context describes the probability @xmath12 to jump to any node for a random surfer . for www the google search engine uses @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the pagerank vector @xmath14 is the right eigenvector of @xmath2 at @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . according to the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite ,",
    "@xmath14 components are positive and represent the probability to find a random surfer on a given node @xmath5 ( in the stationary limit ) @xcite .",
    "all nodes can be ordered in a decreasing order of probability @xmath17 with highest probability at top values of pagerank index @xmath18",
    ".    the distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath2 can be rather nontrivial with appearance of the fractal weyl law and other unusual properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a matrix @xmath2 with random positive matrix elements , normalized to unity in each column , has @xmath19 eigenvalues @xmath20 concentrated in a small radius @xmath21 and one eigenvalue @xmath15 ( see below in section [ sec_rpfm ] ) .",
    "such a distribution is drastically different from the eigenvalue distributions found for directed networks with algebraic distribution of links @xcite or those found numerically for other directed networks including www of universities @xcite , linux kernel and twitter networks @xcite , wikipedia networks @xcite .",
    "in fact even the albert - barabsi model of preferential attachment @xcite still generates the complex spectrum of @xmath20 with a large gap ( @xmath22 ) @xcite being very different from the gapless and strongly degenerate @xmath2 spectrum of www of british universities @xcite and wikipedia @xcite .",
    "thus it is useful to get a deeper understanding of the spectral properties of directed networks and to develop more advanced models of complex networks which have a spectrum similar to such networks as british universities and wikipedia .    with the aim to understand the spectral properties of google matrix of directed networks we study here the citation network of physical review ( cnpr ) for the whole period up to 2009 @xcite .",
    "this network has @xmath23 nodes ( articles ) and @xmath24 links .",
    "its network structure is very similar to the tree network since the citations are time ordered ( with only a few exceptions of mutual citations of simultaneously published articles ) . as a result",
    "we succeed to develop powerful tools which allowed us to obtain the spectrum of @xmath2 in semi - analytical way .",
    "these results are compared with the spectrum obtained numerically with the help of the powerful arnoldi method ( see its description in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we are able to get a better understanding of the spectral properties of this network . due to time ordering of article citations",
    "there are strong similarities between the cnpr and the network of integers studied recently in @xcite .",
    "we note that the pagerank analysis of the cnpr had been performed in @xcite,@xcite showing its efficiency in determining the influential articles of physical review .",
    "the citation networks are rather generic ( see e.g. @xcite ) and hence the extension of pagerank analysis of such networks is an interesting and important task . here",
    "we put the main accent on the spectrum and eigenstates properties of the google matrix of the cnpr but we also discuss the properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) ranking on pagerank - cheirank plane developed recently in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we also analyze the properties of impactrank which shows a domain of influence of a given article .",
    "in addition to the whole cnpr we also consider the cnpr without rev .",
    "articles which has @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "if in the whole cnpr we eliminate future citations ( see description below ) then this triangular cnpr has @xmath23 , @xmath27 .",
    "thus on average we have approximately 10 links per node .",
    "the network includes all articles of physical review from its foundation in 1893 till the end of 2009 .",
    "the paper is composed as follows : in section ii we present a detailed analysis of the google matrix spectrum of cnpr , the fractal weyl law is discussed in section iii , properties of eigenstates are discussed in section iv , cheirank versus pagerank distributions are considered in section v , properties of impact propagation through the network are studied in section vi , certain random matrix models of google matrix are studied in section vii , the discussion of the results is given in section viii .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( right panel ) ) .    in the following we present the results of numerical and analytical analysis of the spectrum of the cnpr matrix @xmath2",
    ".      the triangular structure of the cnpr google matrix in time index ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) has important consequences for the eigenvalue spectrum @xmath20 defined by the equation for the eigenstates @xmath49 : @xmath50    the spectrum of @xmath2 at @xmath51 , or the spectrum of @xmath52 , obtained by the arnoldi method @xcite with the arnoldi dimension @xmath53 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for comparison we also show the case of reduced cnpr without rev .",
    "phys .. we see that the spectrum of the reduced case is rather similar to the spectrum of the full cnpr .",
    "the nodes can be decomposed in invariant subspace nodes and core space nodes and the matrix @xmath52 can be written in the block structure @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 contains the links from subspace nodes to other subspace nodes , @xmath56 the links from core space nodes to core space nodes and @xmath57 some coupling links from the core space to the invariant subspaces .",
    "the subspace - subspace block @xmath55 is actually composed of ( potentially ) many diagonal blocks for each of the invariant subspaces .",
    "each of these blocks corresponds to a column sum normalized matrix of the same type as @xmath2 and has therefore at least one unit eigenvalue thus explaining a possible high degeneracy of the eigenvalue @xmath15 of @xmath52 .",
    "this structure is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the university networks discussed in @xcite had a considerable number of subspace nodes ( about 20  % ) with a high degeneracy @xmath58 of the leading unit eigenvalue .",
    "however , for the cnpr the number of subspace nodes and unit eigenvalues is quite small ( see figure caption of fig .  [ fig3 ] for detailed values ) .",
    "a network with a similar triangular structure , constructed from factor decompositions of integer numbers , was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was analytically shown that the corresponding matrix @xmath52 has only a small number of non - vanishing eigenvalues and that the numerical diagonalization methods , including the arnoldi method , are facing subtle difficulties of numerical stability due to large jordan blocks associated to the highly degenerate zero eigenvalue .",
    "the numerical diagonalization of these jordan blocks is highly sensitive to numerical round - off errors .",
    "for example a perturbed jordan block of dimension @xmath59 associated to the eigenvalue zero and with a perturbation @xmath60 in the opposite corner has eigenvalues on a complex circle of radius @xmath61 @xcite which may became quite large for sufficient large @xmath59 even for @xmath62 .",
    "therefore in presence of many such jordan blocks the numerical diagonalization methods create rather big `` artificial clouds '' of incorrect eigenvalues .    in the examples studied in @xcite these clouds",
    "extended up to eigenvalues @xmath63 .",
    "the spectrum for the physical review network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows also a sudden increase of the density of eigenvalues below @xmath64 and one needs to be concerned if these eigenvalues are numerically correct or only an artifact of the same type of numerical instability .",
    "actually , there is a quite simple way to verify that they are not reliable due to problems in the numerical evaluation .",
    "for this we apply to the network or the numerical algorithm ( in the computer program ) certain transformations or modifications which are _ mathematically neutral _ or _ equivalent _ , e.  g. a permutation of the index numbers of the network nodes but keeping the same network - link structure , or simply changing the evaluation order in the sums used for the scalar products between vectors ( in the gram - schmidt orthogonalization for the arnoldi method ) .",
    "all these modifications should in theory not modify the results ( assuming that all computations could be done with _ infinite precision _ ) but in numerical computations on a computer with finite precision they modify the round - off errors .",
    "it turns indeed out that the modifications of the initially small round - off errors induce very strong , completely random modifications , for all eigenvalues below @xmath64 clearly indicating that the latter are numerically not accurate .",

    "the nilpotency is very relevant in the paper for two reasons : first it is responsible for the numerical problems to compute the eigenvalues by standard methods ( see next point ) and second it is also partly the solution by allowing a semi - analytical approach to determine the eigenvalues in a different way .    for cnpr",

    "[ fig3 ] the number of accurate eigenvalues with 756 bit precision is certainly considerably higher .",
    "the higher precision arnoldi method certainly improves the quality of the smaller eigenvalues , e.g. for @xmath99 , but it also implies a strange shortcoming as far as the degeneracies of certain particular eigenvalues are concerned .",

    "[ fig7],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    this point can be understood as follows . in theory , assuming perfect precision , the simple version of arnoldi method used here ( in contrast to more complicated block arnoldi methods ) can only determine one eigenvector for a degenerate eigenvalue .",
    "the reason is that for a degenerate eigenvalue we have a particular linear combination of the eigenvectors for this eigenvalue which contribute in any initial vector ( in other words `` one particular '' eigenvector for this eigenvalue ) and during the arnoldi iteration this particular eigenvector will be perfectly conserved and the generated krylov space will only contain this and no other eigenvector for this eigenvalue .",
    "however , due to round - off errors we obtain at each step new random contributions from other eigenvectors of the same eigenvalue and it is only due to these round - off errors that we can see the flat plateaux in fig .",
    "obviously , increasing the precision reduces this round - off error effect and the flat plateaux are indeed considerably smaller for higher precisions .",
    "the question arises about the origin of the degenerate eigenvalues in the core space spectrum .",
    "in other examples , such as the www for certain university networks @xcite , the degeneracies , especially of the leading eigenvalue 1 , could be treated by separating and diagonalizing the exact subspaces and the remaining core space spectrum contained much less or nearly no degenerate eigenvalues .",

    "the eigenvalues due to these subspaces are @xmath146 with degeneracies @xmath147 ( see blue dots in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these exact subspaces exist only due to the modest number of future citation links .",
    "even when we take care that in all cases the arnoldi method is applied to the core space without these 71 subspace nodes , there still remain a lot of degenerate eigenvalues in the core space spectrum .     of the core space eigenvalues of @xmath52 of cnpr , obtained by the arnoldi method ,",

    ", one can employ an argument of analytical continuation using a new method , called `` rational interpolation method '' described in detail in appendix d. without going into much details here , we mention that the main idea of this method is to evaluate this rational function at many support points on the complex unit circle where the series ( [ eq_rationseries ] ) converges well and then to use these values to interpolate the rational function ( [ eq_rationalfunction ] ) by a simpler rational function for which the zeros can be determined numerically well even if they are inside the unit cercle ( where the initial series does not converge ) . for this scheme",
    "it is also very important to use high precision computations .",
    "typically for a given precision of @xmath151 binary digits one may chose a certain number @xmath152 of eigenvalues to be determined choosing the appropriate number of support points ( either @xmath153 or @xmath154 depending on the variant of the method , see also appendix d ) . provided that @xmath152 is not neither too small nor too large ( depending on the value of @xmath151 ) one obtains very reliable core space eigenvalues of @xmath52 of the second group .",
    "for example , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , for @xmath155 we obtain @xmath156 eigenvalues for which the big majority coincides numerically ( error @xmath157 ) with the eigenvalues obtained from the high precision arnoldi method for @xmath158 binary digits and furthermore both variants of the rational interpolation method provide identical spectra .",
    "however for @xmath159 some of the zeros do not coincide with eigenvalues of @xmath52 and most of these deviating zeros lie close to the unit circle .",
    "we can even somehow distinguish between `` good '' zeros ( associated to eigenvalues of @xmath52 ) being identical for both variants of the method and `` bad '' artificial zeros which are completely different for both variants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "we note that for the case of too large @xmath152 values the artificial zeros are extremely sensitive to numerical round - off errors ( in the high precision variables ) and that they change strongly , when slightly modifying the support points ( e.g. a random modification @xmath160 or simply changing their order in the interpolation scheme ) or when changing the precise numerical algorithm ( e.g. between direct sum or horner scheme for the evaluation of the series of the rational function ) .",
    "furthermore , they do not respect the symmetry that the zeros should come in pairs of complex conjugate numbers in case of complex zeros .",
    "this is because thiele s rational interpolation scheme breaks the symmetry due to complex conjugation once round - off errors become relevant .",

    "of course the coefficients @xmath424 or @xmath427 given by ( [ eq_coeffs ] ) need also to be evaluated with the precision of 256 binary digits but there is no problem of using high precision vectors since the non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath70 are rational numbers that allow to perform the evaluation of the vectors @xmath465 with arbitrary precision .",
    "we also tested a random modification of @xmath424 according to @xmath466 where @xmath467 is a random number in the interval @xmath468 - 0.5,\\,0.5[$ ] .",
    "this modification gives significant differences of the order of @xmath469 to @xmath470 for some of the complex zeros and which are well visible in the graphical representation of the spectra .",
    "therefore , the spectrum depends in a very sensitive way on these coefficients and it is now quite clear that numerical double - precision diagonalization of @xmath126 , which depends according to ( [ eq_repmatrix ] ) on the values @xmath424 , can not provide accurate eigenvalues simply because the double - precision round - off errors of @xmath424 imply a sensitive change of eigenvalues . in particular some of the numerical eigenvalues of @xmath126 differ quite strongly from the high precision zeros of the reduced polynomial .    in order to study more precisely the effect of the numerical instability of the arnoldi method due to the jordan blocks we also use the gmp library to increase the numerical precision of the arnoldi method",
    "to be precise we implement the first part of this method , the _ arnold iteration _ in which the @xmath471 arnoldi representation matrix is determined by the gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure , using high precision numbers while for the second step , the numerical diagonalization of this representation matrix , we keep the standard double - precision .",
    "it turns that only the first step is numerically critical . once the arnoldi representation matrix is obtained in a careful and precise way , it is numerically well conditioned and its numerical diagonalization works well with only double - precision .",

    "( [ eq_matrixs ] ) but now @xmath70 is not nilpotent .",
    "there are two groups of eigenvectors @xmath86 of @xmath52 with eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "the first group is characterized by the orthogonality @xmath417 of the eigenvector @xmath86 with respect to the dangling vector @xmath112 and the second group is characterized by the non - orthogonality @xmath419 . in the following ,",
    "we describe efficient methods to determine all eigenvalues of the first group and a considerable number of eigenvalues of the second group .",
    "we note that for the case of a purely triangular network the first group contains only eigenvectors for the eigenvalue 0 and the second group contains the eigenvectors for the @xmath73 non - vanishing eigenvalues as discussed in appendix a. in principle there are also complications due to generalized eigenvectors ( associated to non - trivial jordan blocks ) but they appear mainly for the eigenvalue zero and for the moment we do not discuss these complications .",
    "first we note that the subspace eigenvectors of @xmath52 belong to the first group because the nodes of the subspaces of @xmath52 can not contain dangling nodes which , by construction of @xmath52 , are linked to any other node and therefore belong to the core space . since any subspace eigenvector @xmath86 has non - vanishing values only for subspace nodes being different from dangling nodes we have obviously @xmath417 .",
    "we also note that an eigenvector of @xmath52 of the first group with @xmath417 is due to ( [ eq_matrixs ] ) also an eigenvector of @xmath70 with the same eigenvalue .    for",
    "the remaining eigenvectors in the first group one might try to diagonalize the matrix @xmath70 and check for each eigenvector of @xmath70 if the identity @xmath417 holds in which case we would obtain an eigenvector of @xmath52 of the first group but generically , and apart from the subspace eigenvectors , there is no reason that eigenvectors of @xmath70 with isolated non - degenerate eigenvalues obey this identity .",
    "however , if we have an eigenvalue of @xmath70 with a degeneracy @xmath472 we may construct by suitable linear combinations @xmath473 linearly independent eigenvectors of @xmath70 which also obey @xmath417 and therefore this eigenvalue with degeneracy @xmath402 of @xmath70 is also an eigenvalue with degeneracy @xmath473 of @xmath52 . in order to determine the degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath70",
    "it is useful to determine the subspaces of @xmath70 which ( in contrast to the subspaces of @xmath52 ) may contain dangling nodes . actually , each dangling node is a trivial invariant subspace ( for @xmath70 ) of dimension 1 with a network matrix of size @xmath474 and being zero .",
    "explicitly we have implemented the following procedure : first we determine the subspaces of @xmath52 ( with 71 nodes in total ) and remove these nodes from the network .",
    "then we determine all subspaces of @xmath70 whose dimension is below 10 .",
    "each time such a subspace is found its nodes are immediately removed from the network .",
    "when we have tested in a first run all nodes as potential subspace nodes the procedure is repeated until no new subspaces of maximal dimension 10 are found since removal of former subspaces may have created new subspaces .",
    "then the limit size of 10 is doubled to 20 , 40 , 80 etc . to ensure that we do not miss large subspaces .",
    "however , for the cnpr it turns out that the limit size of 10 allows to find all subspaces . in our procedure a subsequently found subspace may potentially have links to a former subspace leading to a block - triangular ( and not block - diagonal structure as it was done in ref .",
    "this method to determine `` relative '' subspaces of a network already reduced by former subspaces is more convenient for the cnpr which is nearly triangular and it allows also to determine correctly all subspace eigenvalues by diagonalizing each relative subspace network .",
    "the removal of subspace nodes of @xmath52 and @xmath70 reduces the network size from @xmath23 to @xmath475 . in the next step",
    "we remove in the same way the subspaces of the transpose @xmath476 of @xmath70 ( since the eigenvalues of @xmath476 and @xmath70 are the same ) which reduces the network size furthermore to @xmath477 . in total",
    "this procedure provides a block triangular structure of @xmath70 as : @xmath478 where @xmath479 represent the diagonal subblocks associated to the subspaces of @xmath52 and @xmath70 while @xmath480 represent the diagonal subblocks associated to the subspaces of @xmath476 and @xmath481 is the `` bulk '' part for the remaining network of @xmath477 nodes .",
    "the stars represent potential non - vanishing entries whose values do not influence the eigenvalues of @xmath70 .",
    "the subspace blocks @xmath479 and @xmath480 which are individually of maximal dimension 10 can be directly diagonalized and it turns that out of @xmath482 eigenvalues in these blocks only about @xmath483 eigenvalues ( counting degeneracies ) or @xmath484 eigenvalues ( non - counting degeneracies ) are different from zero .",
    "most of these eigenvalues are not degenerate and are therefore not eigenvalues of @xmath52 but there are still quite many degenerate eigenvalues at @xmath485 with @xmath486 taking small integer values and who are also eigenvalues of @xmath52 with a degeneracy reduced by one .    concerning the bulk block @xmath481 we can write it in the form @xmath487 where @xmath488 is the first column vector of @xmath481 and @xmath489 .",
    "the matrix @xmath490 is obtained from @xmath481 by replacing its first column to zero .",
    "we can apply the above argumentation between @xmath52 and @xmath70 in the same way to @xmath481 and @xmath490 , i.e. the degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath490 with degeneracy @xmath402 are also eigenvalues of @xmath481 with degeneracy @xmath473 ( with eigenvectors obeying @xmath491 ) and therefore eigenvalues of @xmath52 with degeneracy @xmath492 .",
    "the matrix @xmath490 is decomposed in a similar way as in ( [ eq_s0block ] ) with subspace blocks , which can be diagonalized numerically , and a new bulk block @xmath493 of dimension @xmath494 and which may be treated in the same way by taking out its first column .",
    "this procedure provides a recursive scheme which after 9 iterations stops with a final bulk block of zero size . at each iteration",
    "we keep only subspace eigenvalues with degeneracies @xmath472 and which are joined with reduced degeneracies @xmath473 to the subspace spectrum of the previous iteration . for this joined spectrum we keep again only eigenvalues with degeneracies @xmath472 which are joined with the subspace spectrum of the next higher level etc .    in this way we have determined all eigenvalues of @xmath70 with a degeneracy @xmath472 which belong to the eigenvalues of @xmath52 of the first group . including the direct subspace of @xmath52 there are 4999 non - vanishing eigenvalues ( counting degeneracies ) or 442 non - vanishing eigenvalues ( non - counting degeneracies ) .",
    "the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalue ( or the dimension of the generalized kernel ) is found by this procedure to be @xmath495 but this would only be correct assuming that there are no general eigenvectors of higher order ( representation vectors of non - trivial jordan blocks ) which is clearly not the case .",
    "the jordan subspace structure of the zero eigenvalue complicates the argumentation . here at each iteration",
    "step the degeneracy has to be reduced from @xmath402 to @xmath496 where @xmath497 is the dimension of the maximal jordan block since each generalized eigenvector at a given order has to be treated as an independent vector when constructing vectors obeying the orthogonality with respect to the dangling vector @xmath112 .",
    "therefore the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalue can not be determined exactly but we may estimate its degeneracy of about @xmath498 out of @xmath499 nodes in total .",
    "this implies that the number of non - vanishing eigenvalues is about @xmath500 which is considerably larger than the value of @xmath501 for the triangular cnpr but still much smaller than the total network size .    in table",

    "we now consider the eigenvalues @xmath20 of @xmath52 for the eigenvectors of the second group with non - orthogonality @xmath527 or @xmath420 after proper renormalization of @xmath86 . now",
    "@xmath86 can not be an eigenvector of @xmath70 and @xmath20 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath70 . similarly as in appendix a the eigenvalue equation @xmath528 , the condition @xmath420 and ( [ eq_matrixs ] ) imply that the eigenvalue @xmath20 of @xmath52 is a zero of the rational function @xmath529 where we have formally expanded the vector @xmath530 in eigenvectors of @xmath70 and with @xmath531 being the eigenvalues of @xmath70 and @xmath532 is the _ order _ of the eigenvector of @xmath531 used in this expansion , i.e. @xmath533 for simple eigenvectors and @xmath534 for generalized eigenvectors of higher order due to jordan blocks . note that even the largest possible value of @xmath532 for a given eigenvalue may be ( much ) smaller than its multiplicity @xmath402 . furthermore the case of simple repeating eigenvalues ( with simple eigenvectors ) with higher multiplicity @xmath535 leads only to several identical terms @xmath536 for any eigenvector of this eigenvalue thus all contributing to the coefficients @xmath537 and whose precise values we do not need to know in the following . for us",
    "the important point is that the second identity in ( [ eq_rationalfunction ] ) establishes that @xmath538 is indeed a rational function whose denominator and numerator polynomials have the same degree and whose poles are ( some of ) the eigenvalues of @xmath70 .",
    "we mention that one can also show by a simple determinant calculation ( similar to a calculation shown in @xcite for triangular networks with nilpotent @xmath70 ) that : @xmath539 where @xmath540 [ or @xmath541 is the characteristic polynomial of @xmath52 ( @xmath70 ) . therefore those zeros of @xmath538 which are not zeros of @xmath542 ( i.e. not eigenvalues of @xmath70 ) are indeed zeros of @xmath540 ( i.e. eigenvalues of @xmath52 ) since there are not poles of @xmath538 .",
    "furthermore , generically the _ simple _ zeros @xmath542 also appear as poles in @xmath538 and are therefore not eigenvalues of @xmath52 . however , for a zero of @xmath542 ( eigenvalue of @xmath70 ) with _ higher multiplicity _ @xmath535 ( and unless @xmath402 is equal to the maximal jordan block order @xmath532 associated to this eigenvalue of @xmath70 ) the corresponding pole in @xmath538 only reduces the multiplicity to @xmath473 ( or @xmath543 in case of higher order generalized eigenvectors ) and we have also a zero of @xmath540 ( eigenvalue of @xmath52 ) . some of the eigenvalues of @xmath70 , whose eigenvectors @xmath86 are orthogonal to the dangling vector ( @xmath417 ) and do not contribute in the expansion in ( [ eq_rationalfunction ] ) , are not poles of @xmath538 and therefore also eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "this concerns essentially the direct subspace eigenvalues of @xmath52 which are also direct subspace eigenvalues of @xmath70 as already discussed in appendix c. in total the identity ( [ eq_characpoly ] ) confirms exactly the above picture that there are two groups of eigenvalues and with the special role of direct subspace eigenvalues belonging to the first group .",
    "our aim is to determine numerically the zeros of the rational function @xmath538 . in order to evaluate this function",

    "it turns that in this way we obtain correctly the largest core space eigenvalue of @xmath52 as @xmath548 which is also obtained by ( any variant of ) the arnoldi method .",
    "however , the other zeros obtained by this approximation lie all on a circle of radius @xmath549 in the complex plane and obviously do not represent any valid eigenvalues . increasing the cutoff value @xmath73 does not help either and it increases only the density of zeros on this circle . to understand this behavior",
    "we note that in the limit @xmath550 the coefficients @xmath424 behave as @xmath551 where @xmath552 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath70 with an eigenvector non - orthogonal to @xmath112 .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath70 has also some degenerate eigenvalues at @xmath553 and @xmath554 but these eigenvalues are obtained from the direct subspace eigenvectors of @xmath52 ( which are also direct subspace eigenvectors of @xmath70 ) and which are orthogonal to the dangling vector @xmath112 and do not contribute in the rational function ( [ eq_rationalfunction ] ) .",

    "the only eigenvalue respecting this condition is the largest core space eigenvalue @xmath559 given above .    one may try to improve this by a `` better '' approximation which consists of evaluating the sum exactly up to some value @xmath73 and than to replace the remaining sum as a geometric series with the approximation : @xmath560 for @xmath561 and with @xmath555 determined as the ratio @xmath562 ( which provides a sufficient approximation ) or taken as its exact ( high precision ) value .",
    "this improved approximation results in @xmath563 with a polynomial @xmath564 whose zeros provide in total four correct eigenvalues .",
    "apart from @xmath559 it also gives @xmath565 ( note that this eigenvalue of @xmath52 is very close but different to the eigenvalue @xmath555 of @xmath70 ) and @xmath566 such that @xmath567 .",
    "all these four core space eigenvalues coincide very well with the first four eigenvalues obtained from the arnoldi method .",
    "however , the other zeros of the polynomial @xmath564 lie again on a circle , now with a reduced radius @xmath568 , and do not coincide with eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the coefficients @xmath424 obey for @xmath550 the more precise asymptotic expression @xmath569 with the next eigenvalues @xmath174 and @xmath570 .",
    "here the first term @xmath571 is dealt with analytically by the replacement of the geometric series but the other terms create a new convergence problem .",
    "therefore the improved approximation allows only to determine the four core space eigenvalues with @xmath572 . to obtain more valid eigenvalues",
    "it seems to be necessary to sum up by geometric series many of the next terms , not only the next two terms due to @xmath573 and @xmath574 , but also the following terms of smaller eigenvalues @xmath531 of @xmath70 . in other words the exact pole structure of the rational function @xmath538",
    "has be kept as best as possible .    therefore due to the rational structure of the function @xmath538 with many eigenvalues @xmath531 of @xmath70 that determine its precise pole structure we suggest the following numerical approach using high precision arithmetic . for a given number @xmath151 of binary digits , e.g. @xmath155",
    ", we determine the coefficients @xmath424 for @xmath547 where the cutoff value @xmath575 is sufficiently large to evaluate the sum ( [ eq_rationseries ] ) accurately in the given precision of @xmath151 binary digits ( error below @xmath576 ) for _ all complex values @xmath20 on the unit circle _",
    ", i.e. @xmath577 , where the series converges well .",
    "furthermore we choose a number @xmath152 of `` eigenvalues '' we want to calculate , e.g. @xmath156 , and evaluate the rational function @xmath578 at @xmath579 support points @xmath580 ( @xmath581 ) uniformly distributed on the unit circle using the series ( [ eq_rationseries ] ) .",
    "then we calculate the rational function @xmath582 which interpolates @xmath578 at the @xmath583 support points @xmath584 , @xmath585 , using thiele s interpolation formula",
    ". then the numerator and denominator polynomials of @xmath582 are both of degree @xmath152 .",
    "thiele s interpolation formula expresses @xmath582 in terms of a continued fraction expansion using inverse differences .",
    "this method is quite standard and well described in the literature of numerical mathematics , see for example @xcite . after having evaluated a table of @xmath583 inverse differences ( with @xmath586 operations ) one can evaluate arbitrary values of @xmath582 using the continued fraction expansion ( with @xmath583 operations ) .",
    "it is not very difficult to derive from the continued fraction expansion a recursive scheme to evaluate the values of the numerator and denominator polynomials separately as well as their derivatives . using this scheme we determine the @xmath152 complex zeros of the numerator polynomial using the ( high precision variant of the ) newton - maehly method .",
    "these zeros correspond to the zeros of the rational functional @xmath578 and are taken as approximate eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath52 of the second group .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to evaluate these zeros from the analytical continuation of @xmath578 using values for @xmath587 to determine its zeros well inside the unit circle .",
    "we also consider a second variant of the method where the number of support points @xmath588 is even ( instead of @xmath579 being odd as for the first variant ) . in this case",
    "the numerator polynomial is of degree @xmath589 ( instead of @xmath152 ) while the denominator polynomial is of degree @xmath152 and we choose to interpolate the inverse of the rational function @xmath590 ( instead of @xmath578 itself ) by @xmath582 such that the zeros of @xmath578 are given by the @xmath152 zeros of the denominator ( instead of the numerator ) polynomial of @xmath582 .",
    "the number @xmath152 must not be too small in order to well approximate the second identity in ( [ eq_rationalfunction ] ) by the fit function .",
    "on the other hand for a given precision of @xmath151 binary digits the number of @xmath152 must not be too large as well because the coefficients @xmath424 , which may be written as the expansion @xmath591 , do not contain enough information to resolve its structure for the smaller eigenvalues @xmath531 of @xmath70 .",
    "therefore for too large values of @xmath152 ( for a given precision ) , we obtain additional artificial zeros of the numerator polynomial ( or of the denominator polynomial for the second variant ) of @xmath582 , mostly close to the unit circle , somehow as additional nodes around the support points .",
    "it turns out that for the proper combination of @xmath151 and @xmath152 values the method provides highly accurate eigenvalues and works astonishingly well .",
    "in particular for values of @xmath152 below a certain threshold ( depending on the precision @xmath151 ) both variants of the method with odd or even number of support points provide numerically identical zeros ( with final results rounded to 52 binary digits ) which indeed coincide very accurately ( for most of them ) with the eigenvalues of @xmath52 we want to determine .",
    "we remind that the rational interpolation method allows only to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath52 of the second group , i.e. the eigenvalues which are not eigenvalues of @xmath70 and whose eigenvectors obey @xmath419 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the first group ( with @xmath592 ) have to be determined separately by the scheme of degenerate subspace eigenvalues of @xmath70 described in appendix c. in particular the eigenvalues given in table  [ table1 ] and belonging to the first group are not zeros of the rational function @xmath578 ( they are actually poles of this function ) but it turns out that there are some zeros of @xmath578 which are very close but not identical to some of the values in table  [ table1 ] . for example",
    "the rational interpolation method provides the following zeros : @xmath593 , @xmath594 , @xmath595 or @xmath596 which are indeed accurate in the given precision since they are stable for all values of @xmath597 and the corresponding maximal value of @xmath152 and we have stopped the newton iteration when the error of a zero was clearly below @xmath462 .",
    "these zeros are also found with the same precision in the data of the high precision arnoldi method for the three different values of @xmath598 , @xmath599 or @xmath158 binary digits .",
    "however , based only on results of the arnoldi method it is not really clear if the small corrections to @xmath600 or @xmath601 are real and exact or numerically artificial since the arnoldi method has indeed problems with degenerate and clustered eigenvalues @xcite",
    ". therefore the rational interpolation method provides an independent and strong confirmation of the accuracy of these type of eigenvalues .",
    "we attribute their existence to a quasi - subspace structure , similarly as discussed in @xcite , with a matrix subblock as in ( [ eq_2x2blocks ] ) but which is still very weakly coupled ( by many indirect network links ) to the core space .",

    "we have chosen a time ordering where between these papers , degenerate in publication time , the initial node order of the raw data is kept . note that some of the non - vanishing components of the iteration vector @xmath82 may become very small , e.g. @xmath602 . in this context",
