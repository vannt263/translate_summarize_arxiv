    "magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) are currently used for information readout in disk drives  @xcite , and for high sensitivity magnetic field sensors  @xcite , and could be used in future technologies such as spin random access memory  @xcite .",
    "for all these applications , the noise generated at the mtjs is a crucial factor limiting their ultimate performance . besides the ubiquitous frequency independent thermal and shot noise present in mtjs , frequency dependent noise sources such as charge trapping in the oxide barrier  @xcite and thermally excited magnetization fluctuations and domain wall oscillations",
    "@xcite have been identified .",
    "for mtjs with areas larger than a few square microns , these noise sources usually exhibit a @xmath2 frequency dependence due to ensemble averaging of many individual fluctuators  @xcite . in that case",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath2 noise is related to the resistance susceptibility as predicted by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which only applies in thermal equilibrium  @xcite . however , as the dimensions of mtjs are reduced to the single domain range , the applicability of ensemble averaging and the fluctuation - dissipation relation are both under question .    in this work , we report on measurements of low frequency noise ( up to 200 khz ) of single domain mtjs with areas @xmath310@xmath0@xmath1 at a temperature of 10 kelvin .",
    "our results show that for mtjs of this size , the dominant source of low frequency noise are magnetization fluctuations of both free and reference layers . for magnetic fields , @xmath4 , well below the pinning field of the reference layer , @xmath5 , noise from the free layer dominates , and a linear relation between noise magnitude and angular magnetoresistance ( mr ) susceptibility , @xmath6 ( the derivative of magnetoresistance with respect to magnetic field orientation @xmath7 ) , is observed . as @xmath4 increases and becomes comparable to @xmath5 , noise originating from magnetic fluctuations of the reference and free layer become comparable , and the linear relation between noise and @xmath8 no longer holds .",
    "we use mtjs with the following stack composition ( in @xmath9 ) : buffer - layer / ptmn(175)/synthetic - antiferromagnet- pinned - layer ( saf)/mgo(9.5 ) /fe(5 )",

    "the system has been calibrated using metal film resistors as sources of thermal noise and we have observed an almost flat spectrum with small roll - off that can be accurately modeled by a stray capacitance of @xmath3360 pf due to the cryostat wiring and limited amplifier bandwidth .",

    "[ fig : loops ] ( b ) .",
    "we observe that the spectra do not agree with @xmath2 behavior , but can be described by a lorentzian behavior with characteristic timescales from 0.1 to 10 ms , indicating that only a small number of fluctuators contribute to the measured noise  @xcite . at large negative fields ( region 1 ) , where the field is parallel to the magnetic moments of both the free and the reference layers , the spectrum becomes almost flat above 70 khz .",

    "once the free layer completely switches to the antiparallel ( ap ) state ( region 4 ) , the total noise power decreases and the lorenzian corner frequency shifts towards lower frequency . at large positive fields ( region 5 ) , the resistance decreases since @xmath4 becomes comparable to @xmath5 , and starts to depin the layers within the saf .",
    "the noise shows a more @xmath2-like behavior , indicating that the decoupling of the saf layer produces a large number of uncorrelated fluctuations with different energy scales  @xcite .      by varying the orientation of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath4 that satisfies @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the free layer anisotropy field ) it is possible to smoothly rotate the magnetic moment of the free layer .",

    "it is possible that irregular nanopillar edges , material defects , and grain boundaries provide pinning directions at which the magnetic moment is more difficult to rotate ; a larger change in field orientation is required to unpin and rotate the magnetic moment resulting in sudden jumps in resistance .",

    "when the field opposing the reference layer becomes comparable to @xmath5 , the free layer is no longer the dominant source of noise  @xcite .",
    "although the fluctuations of the reference layer do not cause a clearly observable change in the resistance , they can dominate the spectrum at @xmath44 : whereas the free layer is stabilized by the applied field , larger fields will continue to destabilize the saf layers , providing additional mechanisms for fluctuations to occur .",
    "in summary , we have measured low frequency noise of sub - micron mgo - based mtjs at 10 k. in most cases , the noise spectra are lorentzian in character , indicating that noise is produced by a few magnetic fluctuators which are thermally excited in the free layer magnetic electrode .",
    "we experimentally established a linear relation between normalized noise @xmath40 and the angular magnetoresistance susceptibility @xmath8 for @xmath57 , where noise is dominated by magnetization fluctuations of the free layer , and observed that for @xmath58 , destabilization of the reference layer due to saf layer decoupling leads to a transition from free layer to reference layer dominated noise .",
