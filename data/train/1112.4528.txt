    "leptogenesis @xcite is a direct cosmological application of the see - saw mechanism @xcite for the explanation of neutrino masses and mixing and it realises a highly non trivial link between cosmology and neutrino physics .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite has drawn great attention on leptogenesis that became one of the most attractive models of baryogenesis for the explanation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .    in most cases ,",
    "classical boltzmann equations are sufficient for the calculation of the final asymmetry @xcite . however ,",
    "when lepton flavour effects are taken into account @xcite , different sets of classical boltzmann equations apply depending whether the asymmetry is generated in the one - flavour regime , when the mass of the decaying rh neutrinos @xmath1 is much above @xmath2 gev , in the two - flavour regime , for @xmath3 , or in the three - flavour regime for @xmath4 .",
    "moreover classical boltzmann equations fail in reproducing the correct result in the transition regimes for @xmath5 and for @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the case that only the lightest rh neutrino species is assumed to be responsible for the generation of the asymmetry , classical boltzmann equations provide quite a convenient description in phenomenological investigations , since the final asymmetry can be expressed in terms of simple analytical expressions that well approximate the numerical solutions @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the contribution from heavier rh neutrinos can also relevantly contribute to the final asymmetry ( heavy neutrino flavour effects ) and has , therefore , consistently to be taken into account in general @xcite .",
    "when lepton flavour effects are jointly considered @xcite , a reliable calculation of the asymmetry can not neglect the contribution from the heavier rh neutrinos even in the two rh neutrino model @xcite usually considered as a paradigmatic case for the validity of the traditional @xmath0-dominated scenario .",
    "it has also been shown that a successful @xmath7-dominated scenario is naturally realised in the interesting class of @xmath8 inspired models @xcite .",
    "when heavier rh neutrinos are included , one has to distinguish quite a large number of possible mass patterns with different corresponding sets of classical boltzmann equations for the calculation of the final asymmetry .",
    "for example , in the typical case of three rh neutrinos one has ten different possible mass patterns @xcite shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , the requirement that all rh neutrino masses do not fall in a transition regime becomes clearly much more restrictive .",
    "moreover new effects arise when heavy neutrino flavours are taken into account .",
    "first , part of the asymmetry generated by a heavier rh neutrino species , the flavour orthogonal component , escapes the washout from a lighter rh neutrino species @xcite .",
    "second , parts of the flavour asymmetries ( phantom terms ) produced in the one or two flavour regimes do not contribute to the total asymmetry at the production but can contribute to the final asymmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to extend the density matrix formalism beyond the traditional @xmath0-dominated scenario @xcite and account for heavy neutrino flavours effects in order to calculate the final asymmetry for an arbitrary choice of the rh neutrino masses .",
    "this is the main objective of this paper . at the same time we want to show how boltzmann equations can be recovered from the density matrix equations for the hierarchical rh neutrino mass patterns shown in fig .",
    "1 allowing an explicit analytic calculation of the final asymmetry . in this way",
    "we will confirm and extend results that were obtained within a simple quantum state collapse description .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we will proceed in a modular way , first discussing the specific effects in isolation within simplified cases and then discussing the most general case that includes all effects .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the derivation of the kinetic equations for the @xmath0-dominated scenario in the absence of heavy neutrino flavours .",
    "this is useful both to show the extension from classical boltzmann to density matrix equations and to highlight some features that will prove to be quite important when , in the following sections , we will include heavy neutrino flavour effects .",
    "in particular we show the existence of phantom terms and how the expression for the @xmath9 asymmetry matrix can be unambiguously derived from the flavoured @xmath9 asymmetries , taking into account the different flavour compositions of the lepton and anti - lepton quantum states produced in rh neutrino decays .    in section 3",
    "we start discussing the case where two heavy rh neutrino flavours are involved directly in the generation of the asymmetry , considering a simplified case with only two charged lepton flavours . in this way",
    "we simplify the notation and we better highlight the main results . in this section",
    "we are particularly interested to show two effects that specifically arise when the interplay between heavy neutrino and charged lepton flavours is considered .",
    "the first one is phantom leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the second , that we call projection effect , is how part of the asymmetry generated by a heavy rh neutrino , the component orthogonal to the heavy neutrino flavour associated to a lighter rh neutrino , is not washed out by the inverse processes of the latter @xcite .",
    "we also show that these two effects , phantom leptogenesis and projection effect , in general combine with each other .    in section 4 we extend the discussion to the general case with three heavy neutrino flavours and three charged lepton flavours . in this section",
    "we finally obtain general density matrix equations for the calculation of the asymmetry for an arbitrary choice of the rh neutrino masses . from these equations",
    "we derive the classical boltzmann equations for a particularly interesting case : the two rh neutrino model .",
    "the derivation can be easily extended to all ten hierarchical rh neutrino mass patterns shown in fig .  1 . in section 5",
    "we draw the conclusions .",
    "we discuss leptogenesis within a minimal type i seesaw mechanism with three rh neutrino species , @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 , with masses @xmath11 respectively where one adds right - handed neutrinos @xmath12 to the sm lagrangian with yukawa couplings @xmath13 and a majorana mass term that violates lepton number [ lagrangian ] = _ sm + i _",

    "we review the main steps underlying the derivation of the kinetic equations in leptogenesis when heavy neutrino flavours are neglected , assuming that only the lightest rh neutrino decays and inverse processes contribute to the final asymmetry : the traditional @xmath0-dominated scenario .",
    "we first derive the boltzmann ( rate ) equations and then we extend them writing the density matrix equations , accounting for quantum decoherence , flavour oscillations and gauge interactions . this discussion will prove to be useful not only to setup the notation but also to highlight some basic features of the kinetic equations in leptogenesis that will be relevant when we will include heavy neutrino flavour effects in the next section .",
    "we will neglect different effects , processes and corrections that have been studied during the last years and that will not play a relevant role in our discussion .",

    "1 correspond to those cases where the ( five ) different interactions are only one by one effective within a given range of temperatures . in this way",
    "the evolution of the asymmetry can be described in well separated stages where the density matrix equations greatly simplify reducing to multiple sets of boltzmann equations , one for each stage . in these cases we recovered or extended results that had already been derived within a simpler description based on an instantaneous collapse of lepton quantum states .",
    "the flavour projection effect , where the orthogonal component of a previously produced asymmetry escapes the rh neutrino washout , is fully confirmed .",
    "we have also shown that the washout of the parallel component is exactly described by the usual exponential washout factor independently of the washout regime .",
    "phantom terms emerge as quite a generic feature of flavoured leptogenesis and have to be taken into account even for vanishing initial rh neutrino abundances .",
    "they can contribute to the final asymmetry even if the production from an heavier rh neutrino species and the washout from a lighter rh neutrino species occur in the same fully flavoured regime and so their presence goes beyond the @xmath7-dominated scenario where they were originally discussed @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown that , when the effect of gauge interactions in thermalising the lepton abundances is taken into account , phantom terms get washed - out at the production , though their wash - out rate is halved compared to that one acting on the final asymmetry . in this way ,",
    "in the strong wash - out regime , phantom terms give a contribution that is also independent of the initial conditions .    even though we have explicitly calculated the final asymmetry only in one of the ten asymptotic limits rh neutrino mass patterns shown in fig .  1",

    "for example one can easily show the expression for the final asymmetry in the @xmath7-dominated scenario , when @xmath281 @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable in future to calculate the asymmetry beyond these ten asymptotic limits , solving the full density matrix equation . in this way the calculation of the matter - anti matter asymmetry would be extended to a generic rh neutrino mass pattern , including the cases where the rh neutrino masses fall in the transition regimes where quantum decoherence from charged lepton interactions acts simultaneously with asymmetry generation and wash - out .",

    "<S> leptogenesis with heavy neutrino flavours is discussed within a density matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we write the density matrix equation , describing the generation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , for an arbitrary choice of the right - handed ( rh ) neutrino masses . for hierarchical rh neutrino masses lying in the fully flavoured regimes , </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to multiple - stage boltzmann equations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we recover and extend results previously derived within a quantum state collapse description . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the generic existence of phantom terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , taking into account the effect of gauge interactions , we show that they are washed out at the production with a wash - out rate that is halved compared to that one acting on the total asymmetry . in the @xmath0-dominated scenario </S>",
    "<S> they cancel without contributing to the final baryon asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in other scenarios they do not in general and they have to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that there is a ( orthogonal ) component in the asymmetry produced by the heavier rh neutrinos which completely escapes the washout from the lighter rh neutrinos and show that phantom terms additionally contribute to it . </S>",
    "<S> the other ( parallel ) component is washed out with the usual exponential factor , even for weak washout . finally , as an illustration , we study the two rh neutrino model in the light of the above findings , showing that phantom terms can contribute to the final asymmetry also in this case .    </S>",
