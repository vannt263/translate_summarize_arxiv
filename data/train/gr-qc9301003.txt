    "both the united states laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo@xcite ) and the french / italian virgo gravitational - wave observatory@xcite are expected to begin operation in the late 1990s .",
    "inspiralling binary systems of compact objects  either neutron stars or stellar mass black holes with orbital frequencies ranging from 5  s@xmath6 to 500  s@xmath6  are currently regarded as the most certain observable source for these detectors : the density of sources@xcite suggest event rates of several per year and the radiation they emit can be calculated unambiguously @xcite . in support of the ligo / virgo observational effort",
    ", theoreticians must combine refined calculations of the radiation from binary inspiral with the anticipated detector properties to deduce the instrument sensitivity .",
    "these calculations will , in turn , play an important role in the final design and ultimate use of the instruments . in this paper , we begin a detailed analysis of binary inspiral as a source of gravitational radiation for a ligo / virgo - like interferometric detector .    our goal in this work is to estimate the sensitivity of ligo / virgo - like interferometers and the ligo detector by determining the rate at which inspiralling binary systems can be detected , the range to which they can be observed , and the precision with which they can by characterized in a single interferometer .",
    "we also explore the compromises that must be made as different questions are asked of the observations .",
    "the optimal design and operation of these interferometers depends on a detailed understanding of the nature of the detector response to the radiation , the detector noise power spectral density ( psd ) , _ and the questions the observation is meant to resolve .",
    "_ for example , we show in  [ sec : implications ] that the goal of observing as many sources as possible ( without necessarily being able to characterize them precisely ) leads to a different optimal interferometer configuration than the goal of characterizing observed sources as precisely as possible ( while allowing that weak sources may be missed entirely ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of our assessment of binary inspiral is to determine the ability of a single interferometer ( or a network of such interferometers ) to    1 .   _",
    "detect _ the gravitational radiation from the last few minutes of inspiral of a binary neutron star or black hole system , and 2 .",
    "_ measure _ the parameters describing the detected binary system from the observed gravitational radiation .    by _ detection _ we mean the determination of the presence or absence of a signal characteristic of an inspiralling binary system in the output of a detector , _ irrespective _ of the particular parameters that might characterize the observed binary system . by _",
    "measurement _ we mean the determination of the parameters that characterize the signal _ presumed to be present _ in the detector output . in a real detector noise can mask or distort a signal present in the detector output ; alternatively , it can conspire to appear as a signal characteristic of a binary system .",
    "consequently , any conclusion we draw from observations ( _ e.g. , _ that we have detected an inspiralling binary system ) is associated with a probability that characterizes our certainty in its validity .    as a practical matter",
    ", reliable detection of gravitational radiation will initially require coincident observation between two or more interferometers so that non - gaussian noise events can be differentiated from gravitational radiation signals .",
    "when completed , the ligo _ detector _ will consist of two _ interferometers : _ one in hanford , washington and one in livingston , louisiana@xcite .",
    "the relative orientation of the two interferometers has been chosen to maximize their sensitivity to a single polarization state of the gravitational radiation impinging on the earth@xcite ; consequently , the two interferometers act together like a single interferometer whose sensitivity will be greater than that of either of its components .",
    "this analogy is not exact : combining the interferometers in this way ignores the different arrival times of the signal at the two distinct interferometers . nevertheless , our single - detector analysis is directly relevant to the actual ligo configuration , and we discuss our results in the context of _",
    "( i ) _ single ligo / virgo - like _ interferometers _ of the proposed initial and advanced designs , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the ligo _ detector _ in the limit that its two independent interferometers share exactly the same orientation and ignoring the difference in the signal arrival times .    in principle , simultaneous observation of an inspiralling binary system in _ three _ interferometers of different orientations is sufficient to measure ( among other characteristics ) the binary s luminosity distance @xmath11 , its position in the sky , and a function @xmath1 that depends only on the masses of its components and its cosmological redshift@xcite .",
    "if the position is known through other observations , then @xmath12 and @xmath11 can be measured from observations with only two interferometers of different orientations .",
    "observation of an inspiralling binary in a single interferometer can measure @xmath12 and a waveform `` amplitude '' @xmath0 , which depends on the luminosity distance and orientation of the binary with respect to the detector .",
    "even this limited information is of astrophysical significance , however : from observations of the distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 among the observed binaries one can determine the distribution of the component masses of inspiralling binary systems , find the hubble constant and deceleration parameter , and test cosmological models@xcite .    the study of binary systems as sources of gravitational radiation began in 1963 when peters and mathews@xcite made the first detailed calculation of the gravitational radiation luminosity from inspiralling binary systems , focusing on the leading order quadrupole radiation from two point particles in circular and elliptical orbits",
    "clark and eardley@xcite explored how gravitational radiation ( among other effects ) drives the orbital evolution of binary systems .",
    "clark@xcite suggested inspiralling binary systems as an important source of gravitational radiation for modern interferometric detectors ; however , he considered only the burst of radiation from the coalescence event itself .",
    "thorne recognized the importance of the gravitational radiation from the final few minutes of _ inspiral . _ since 1987 a number of investigators have worked with increasing sophistication on problems related to the observation of inspiralling binaries in interferometric detectors .",
    "some have focused on understanding and refining interferometer detector technology @xcite , others have focused on the data analysis problems of detecting or determining the characteristics of a binary system from the radiation @xcite , and still others have focused on refining our understanding of the gravitational radiation waveform from these systems @xcite or their rate of occurrence in the universe@xcite .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : review ] we review how the precision with which the parameterization of a signal , observed in a noisy detector , is determined . in ",

    "in this section we review the techniques we use to determine the statistical uncertainties in observations of binary inspiral . a complete discussion is found in finn@xcite .",
    "the techniques developed there are closely related to those associated with signal analysis by optimal filtering . for more information on optimal filtering and signal analysis we direct the reader to oppenheim , willsky , and young@xcite , the review by davis@xcite and references therein , wainstein and zubakov@xcite , and hancock and wintz@xcite .",
    "consider a deterministic ( _ i.e , _ not stochastic ) source of gravitational radiation ( _ e.g. , _ an inspiralling binary system ) and a detector ( _ e.g. , _ a laser interferometer ) .",
    "we write the response of the detector to the radiation as a superposition of noise @xmath13 and signal @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a minimal set of parameters that uniquely characterizes the detector response ( absent the noise ) to the radiation for the entire duration of the observation ( in  [ sec : application ] we show that for an inspiralling binary system observed by a single interferometric detector @xmath15 is a four dimensional vector ) .",
    "let the source of radiation be characterized by @xmath16 . in analyzing the output of the detector , we have two goals :    1 .   to determine whether a signal is present in the detector output , and 2 .   to find the precision with which we can determine @xmath16 ( assuming a signal is present ) .",
    "owing to the detector noise , we can not determine with certainty either the presence of a signal or ( assuming it present ) @xmath16 .",
    "instead , we find the probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of a signal , and represent our uncertainty in @xmath16 by a set of volumes @xmath17 in parameter space , such that @xmath16 is in @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 .",

    "in a later paper , we will discuss the determination of the probability that a signal of the form @xmath14 is present in the detector output .    each observed signal",
    "is immersed in its own realization of the detector noise ; consequently we can not know in advance of an observation what the volumes @xmath17 will look like .",

    "in this section we apply the techniques described in  [ sec : review ] to the problem of measuring the characteristics of an inspiralling binary system in an interferometric gravitational radiation detector .",
    "we determine the gravitational radiation from an evolving binary system in the quadrupole approximation and evaluate the corresponding detector response .",

    ", we obtain an analytic expression for the fourier transform of the response .",
    "we find that the snr @xmath28 and the covariance matrix @xmath36 can be expressed simply in terms of several moments of @xmath67 , the inverse of the interferometer noise psd .      in order to express the response of a single interferometer to the gravitational radiation from a binary system ( or any source ) , we define two coordinate systems : the _ source _ coordinate system and the _ radiation _ coordinate system .",
