    "since the theory of surface critical phenomena started developing , much attention has been devoted to the study of the blume capel ( bc ) model over semi - infinite lattices , with modified surface couplings .",
    "benyoussef et al .",
    "[ 1 ] have determined the phase diagram in the mean field approximation , reporting four possible topologies at fixed bulk / surface coupling ratios .",
    "an analoguous analysis have also been done using a real space renormalization group transformation [ 2 ] .",
    "some other works referring to particular regions of the phase space are , for example , those using : the mean field approximation [ 3 ] , the effective field approximation [ 4 ] and the low temperature expansion [ 5 ] .",
    "these works show that it is possible to have a phase with ordered surface and disordered bulk , which is separated from the completely ordered phase by the so - called _ extraordinary _ transition and from the completely disordered phase by the _ surface _ transition . in the absence of this phase ,",
    "the transition between the completely ordered and the completely disordered phase is called _",
    "ordinary_. these three kinds of phase transitions have a meeting point named _ special _ and which is generally a multi - critical point .",
    "the discussion presented in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] shows that the strong interest in these models arises partly from the unusually rich phase transition behavior they display as their interaction parameters are varied , and partly from their many possible applications . the bilinear interaction considered in",
    "most of these cases is ferromagnetic .",
    "the spin-@xmath5 ising systems are used to describe both the order - disorder transition and the crystallisation of the binary allow , and it was solved in the mean field approach [ 7 ] .",
    "the decomposition of a line of tri - critical points into a line of critical end points and one of double critical points is is one of the most interesting and elusive features of the mean field phase diagram for the anti - ferromagnetic spin-@xmath5 blume - capel model in an external magnetic field [ 8 ] .",
    "the transfer - matrix and monte carlo finite - size - scaling methods [ 9 ] , are also applied to study this model but such decomposition does not occur in the two dimensional case .",
    "the finite cluster approximation has been applied by benyoussef _",
    "[ 10 ] in order to study the spin-@xmath5 ising model with a random crystal field",
    ". + on the other hand , the transverse field or crystal field effects of spin-@xmath5 ising model has been studied by several authors [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "+ the experimental measurements of layer - by - layer ordering phenomena have been established on free - standing liquid crystals films such as @xmath6 ( n - alkyl-4-n - alkyloxybiphenyl-4-carboxylate ) [ 15,16 ] and @xmath7 ( n - pentyl-4-n - pentanoyloxy - biphenyl-4-carboxylate ) [ 17 ] for several molecular layers .",
    "more recently , lin _ el al .",
    "_ [ 18 ] have used the three - level potts model to show the existence of layer - by - layer ordering of ultra thin liquid crystal films of free - standing @xmath7 films , by adjusting the interlayer and intra layer couplings between nearest- neighboring molecules .",

    "the surface crystal field @xmath45 , applied on each layer @xmath4 is distributed according to the law given by eq . @xmath46 .",
