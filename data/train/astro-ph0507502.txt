    "due to the lower resolution of these images compared to the acs , the progenitor position was too close to the brighter object to the southwest to allow accurate simultaneous psf fitting .",

    "the bright objects on the image were subtracted off by psf fitting , and fainter objects were identified on the resultant frame .",
    "after three iterations of psf fitting and subtraction , a boxcar median filtered image was constructed , which should be representative of the varying galaxy background .",

    "statistical calculations of the 3@xmath38 detection limits were determined from the detector characteristics and the sky noise .",
    "this was compared with the measured magnitudes of the faintest real objects in the images which could be visually identified and which were both well fit with a psf and subtracted off cleanly .",
    "the 3@xmath38 calculated limits were significantly fainter ( by @xmath390.7 mag ) than these objects , but the 5@xmath38 limits agreed well with the magnitudes of the faintest sources measured in the image .",

    "they reported that the equivalent width of the host - galaxy component was similar in strength to the galactic component of 0.2 .",
    "@xcite provide relationships between the strength of the naid absorption and the reddening from the intervening medium .",

    "the three colour photometry of red supergiants ( @xmath54 ) within @xmath55 of sn 2005cs was also used to estimate the reddening as detailed in @xcite .",
    "stellar positions were plotted on a two - colour diagram ( @xmath56 vs. @xmath57 ) and compared with a theoretical supergiant colour sequence .",
    "the weighted mean displacement of the stars positions , along the reddening vector , from the theoretical colour sequence provided a measure of reddening .",

    "there is a clear and unambiguous detection of the progenitor of sn2005cs in the acs f814w image .",
    "as we have only one detection , the colour of the star makes the transformation from the f814w to standard johnson @xmath37 a little uncertain , and indeed all the transformations between the acs filters and standard @xmath60 are subject to a similar uncertainty .",
    "however from the non - detections in the other bands , we can confidently say that it was a red star , later than mid k - type and the corrections between the acs and johnson @xmath61 system are at most 0.2 mag , if the star was at the extreme m5 cool end @xcite .",
    "hence in the rest of this discussion we interpret the acs filter magnitudes as standard @xmath60 , and the relatively small uncertainties are included in the error analysis .",
    "the non - detection of a source in the @xmath62-band images is a very robust argument that the star was red .",

    "3 , with the stellar evolution tracks from the geneva group plotted at @xmath69 .",
    "the range in @xmath70 at a constant @xmath71 comes from the quadrature combined errors in distance , reddening , measured @xmath37-band magnitude ( including colour correction ) , and bolometric correction ( assuming plus or minus one spectral subtype ) .",
    "we can place quite a restrictive box on the location of the red supergiant progenitor in the hrd , even with a detection in only one band .",
    "the star was likely to have been a red supergiant of initial mass 9@xmath72m@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite report an initial mass of @xmath73m@xmath12 , and indeed the position of the progenitor is closer to 7m@xmath12 in their figure .",

    "one possibility often suggested to explain this is that the progenitors may be dust enshrouded red supergiants and hence appear to have lower mass and lower luminosity .",
    "although the sne themselves are not reddened , a plausible scenario is the destruction of this dust by the explosion @xcite .",
    "however the deep @xmath22-band image argues against this scenario . even if the visual extinction were as high as @xmath75 , the @xmath76band images would be sensitive to stars with @xmath77 , and with the bolometric corrections of @xcite this implies @xmath78 .",
    "even when conservative errors on the distance , limiting magnitudes and bolometric correction are included ( resulting in @xmath790.2dex ) , fig.3 shows that this rules out red supergiants with masses greater than 12m@xmath12 .    in summary",
    ", this letter presents the unambiguous detection of a red supergiant as the progenitor of sn  2005cs .",
    "we show that the likely initial mass for the star was in the range @xmath11m@xmath12 .",
