    "glasses develop a resistance to a macroscopic deformation , like solids , but depict a lack of structural order , like liquids . in solids , the response to such a deformation is theoretically approached by the use of the continuum elasticity , which involve phonons to model the vibrational excitations . due to the loss of translational invariance in glasses in comparison to the corresponding crystal ,",
    "propagating phonons are difficult to describe , but have already been observed down to the atomic level @xcite .",
    "it s also admitted that a common characteristic of disordered solids , when compared to crystalline ones , lies in the existence of an excess of low - frequency vibrational states , the well known boson peak .",
    "this excess produces the also well - known specific heat anomaly of glasses at temperatures @xmath0 , and seems to be a signature of the disorder in glasses beyond the nanometer scale .",
    "many attempts have been proposed to theoretically interpret the boson peak anomaly @xcite , and among them , shintani and tanaka @xcite have recently proposed an interpretation in term of involved atomic arrangements with transverse vibrations that tend to be particularly strong , in two - dimensional systems , around favoured structures of five - fold symmetry .",
    "the framework in which the boson peak is more related with transverse vibrations than longitudinal ones has been already approached in a series of papers dealing with the vibrational and mechanical properties of two- and three - dimensional soft ( lennard - jones ) and strong ( silica ) glasses @xcite . in those systems ,",
    "transversal motions of the particles give rise to large vortices of characteristic size @xmath1 , when they respond to a macroscopic deformation . this noisy displacement field has been called _ non - affine _ displacement field , and involve correlated displacement of atoms from @xmath2 inter - atomic distances in three dimensions , to @xmath3 in two dimensions . in both soft and strong glasses ,",
    "the application of the classical continuum elasticity theory is subject to strong limitations below such length scales @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is particularly important when the wavelength of the vibrational excitation is less than this characteristic size @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the departure from classical behaviour is very likely related to the disorder in inter - atomic interactions ( local stresses , inhomogeneities in elastic constants , local anisotropy ) .",
    "this leads to an important decrease of the average shear modulus in amorphous systems compared with the corresponding crystals .",
    "note that the typical size @xmath1 depends on the pressure : it decreases and saturates at high pressures for both soft and strong glasses .",
    "finally , it has been also previously noticed that the estimate of the frequency associated with @xmath1 is in good agreement with the boson peak position @xcite , and thus should encourage to consider the boson peak as a length marking a crossover between _ ( i ) _ a regime where vibrations with wavelengths larger than @xmath1 may be well described by a classical continuum theory , and _",
    "( ii ) _ a small wavelength regime where vibrations are strongly affected by the elastic heterogeneities ( eh ) .    in the following",
    ", such a picture will be confirmed in the case of a two - dimensional glass . after a summary of the theoretical concepts related with the continuum elasticity and an overview of the simulated system ,",
    "the pressure dependence of the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) and the boson peak will be approached for both strong and soft glasses .",
    "we then expect significant change of the vdos upon compression , namely a decrease of boson peak height and its shift toward higher frequencies @xcite . while this kind of pressure dependence study is merely used , in the literature , to improve the theoretical interpretations of the boson peak @xcite , most of the present work will be devoted in the effect of increasing pressure , on the interplay between elastic heterogeneities ( eh ) and elastic wave propagation in a two - dimensional glass .",
    "we first briefly review the considered systems studied in this work , much more details about them being given in previous works @xcite . then",
    ", the theoretical framework used in background of this work is summarized .",
    "the two - dimensional prototype materials we consider are bulk - like systems contained in a square of side @xmath4 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "computationally , they are formed by quenching very quickly a slightly polydisperse liquid of @xmath5 spherical particles interacting via simple lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potential , into the nearest energy minimum , following a fixed protocol  @xcite using standard molecular dynamics , steepest descent and conjugate gradient .",
    "the resulting structures are amorphous , _ i.e. _ they exhibit not a crystal - like , but a liquid - like order . the density of the bulk - like 2d glassy materials in the final state are adjusted in order to cover a wide range of hydrostatic pressure from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( in lj units ) .",
    "this kind of glass mimics a soft glass according to angell s classification @xcite . on the other hand , an amorphous silica glass is also simulated in the bks framework @xcite , and using a fixed quench protocol @xcite that do not alter the final glassy state . for this kind of glass ,",
    "systems containing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 particles were used , and for hydrostatic pressures from @xmath10 gpa to @xmath11 gpa .      in the framework of the linear classical theory of elasticity , which assume that elastic bodies are homogeneous and isotropic , the landau free energy can be written on the form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the lame coefficients , @xmath14 the space dimension , and the strain @xmath15 for the continuum displacement field @xmath16 .",
    "the stress is related to the strain using the classical relation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the reference state stress . using this formalism , the equation of motion for the elastic field @xmath19 ,",
    "can be written in a wave formulation :    @xmath20    the eq .",
    "can be solved using the stokes decomposition @xmath21 , with @xmath22 for longitudinal waves of speed @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for transverse waves of speed @xmath25 .",
    "these two wave equations can be solved using the plane waves basis with wave length @xmath26 . for finite size systems as the ones we re simulating , @xmath14 quantum numbers appear and for instance in two - dimensions , @xmath27 .",
    "then , the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) is expressed as :    @xmath28    using the debye s model @xcite for set of phonon propagating in a continuum medium , this vibrational density of states can be explicitly evaluated , which leads to the famous formulae :    @xmath29    in particle based simulations , it s in principle possible to access the low temperature vibrational spectrum of glasses using the harmonic approximation @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the equation of motion for an atom @xmath31 , @xmath32 , becomes equivalent for the whole system to an euler - lagrange eigenvalue problem @xmath33 on the plane wave basis .",
    "therefore , the vibration frequencies around an equilibrium position can be exactly calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix @xmath34 , which is expressible in terms of the first and second derivatives of the inter - particle interaction potentials , while the corresponding displacement fields are given by the eigenvectors .",
    "using the formalism developed in the previous sec.[subsec : vmodes ] , a first look on vibrational eigen - frequencies is presented in the following , by also varying the applied hydrostatic pressure of simulated systems .",
    "the three - dimensional glass is approached using a silica glass , and the two - dimensional one using a lennard - jones glass .      on fig.[fig1](a ) , the vdos from eq . for a silica glass under different hydrostatic pressure",
    "are plotted .",
    "results are in agreement with numerical and experimental literature @xcite . in the inset of this figure , the ratio to the debye s prediction eq . which depicts the boson peak anomaly is shown .",
    "it appears that the boson peak intensity decreases with increasing pressure and tends to be unmeasurable at very high pressure .",
    "the corresponding boson peak frequency @xmath35 also shifts to higher frequencies @xcite .     for the characteristic size @xmath36 @xcite of the elastic heterogeneous domains are also drawn.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]   for the characteristic size @xmath36 @xcite of the elastic heterogeneous domains are also drawn.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    on the fig.[fig2](a ) , a scaling analysis for the silica glass",
    "is plotted using reduced units @xmath37 , which may lead to a collapse of the vdos on a single master curve @xcite , at least depending the strength of the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we then observe for pressures less than 7 gpa , that the rescaled vdos collapse well ( as also observed in @xcite ) , but for higher pressures , this collapse is lost .",
    "this is related to a great change in the structure of the considered strong glass former at such pressures @xcite . in the inset of the fig.[fig2](a ) , the variation of the boson peak intensity @xmath38 is compared to the one of the debye level , while the onset of irreversible compression around @xmath39 gpa is also drawn @xcite . in this inset , quantities are normalized to unity by their values at @xmath10 gpa . it has been observed experimentally @xcite , that the boson peak shift follows the variation of the debye level under permanently densified silicate glasses , and so should be related to a transformation of the elastic medium .",
    "a contrary in @xcite , the relative variation between both quantities has been shown to increase , i.e. the boson peak shift pressure dependence is stronger than for the debye level .",
    "the authors in @xcite thus conclude that the boson peak phenomena may not be only explained by a transformation of the elastic continuum upon compression .",
    "rescaled units , where @xmath40 is the boson peak frequency . both scaling lead to a curve collapse for pressures less than @xmath41 gpa , above which the silica glass involves strong structural modifications . * ( a ) * :",

    "_ inset : _ rescaled boson peak and debye frequency ( see text ) versus pressure.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    in the inset of the fig.[fig2](a ) , the relative ratio between @xmath38 and the debye level decreases with the same trend upon compression , which should also corroborate the full continuum medium transformation ( cmt ) picture .",
    "in fact , the situation is more complex , as shown on the fig.[fig3 ] , where the cmt statement @xmath42 is plotted versus the compression level . as already pointed out in @xcite , it s observed a strong non - linear pressure dependence of the cmt prescription in this silica glass .",
    "this suggests that the cmt picture can not fully , or at least solely , explain the boson peak nature and behaviour under compression .",
    "a confirmation is then obtained on the fig.[fig2](b ) , where the vdos are plotted using another set of rescaling units @xmath43 that takes into account the conservation of modes , while keeping the adimensional parameter @xmath37 on abscissa .",
    "again , reasonable collapse of vdos is achieved for pressures less than @xmath39 gpa .",
    "more intriguingly , in the inset of fig.[fig2](b ) are also drawn the pressure variations of two scaling quantities with respect to the @xmath44 gpa state : @xmath45 for the boson peak and @xmath46 for the debye frequency . as recently observed in @xcite for a permanently densified @xmath47 glass",
    ", it appears that the rescaled frequency of the boson peak @xmath48 has a slope greater than the debye one @xmath49 , which also points out that the cmt can not fully account for the pressure dependence of low - vibrational dynamics in silica glass .",
    "furthermore , it has been also shown in @xcite by studying the half - width raman intensity main band , that amorphous silica undergoes strong inter - tetrahedral structural rearrangements upon compression , which also shows that this glass is not homogeneous at nano - metric scale .",
    "we also measured the shift of the maximum of the inter - tetrahedra angle distributions with increasing pressure ( not shown ) , and found values in agreement with experimental ones @xcite .        in the inset of the fig.[fig3 ] , the ratio between the number @xmath50 of connected tetrahedral units that have the same rotation , and those @xmath51 that have opposite ones , is plotted versus the hydrostatic pressure , after an elastic elongation has been applied to the material .",
    "this ratio @xmath52 is an indicator of the amount of inhomogeneous atoms rearrangements at a given hydrostatic pressure state , namely when @xmath53 . in the inset of this figure",
    ", one can observes that the number of identical rotations @xmath50 has a tendency to dominate the number of opposite inter - tetrahedral moves , when the hydrostatic pressure increases . in that way , the silica glass undergoes a decrease of inhomogeneous particle rearrangements with increasing pressure , i.e. the response of the glass is more and more homogeneous at all scales .",
    "this could explain the decrease of the boson peak intensity , as well as also introduces the possible link between structural effects related to the disorder , and the vibrational properties of this glass .    finally , on the fig.[fig1](b )",
    ", the vdos of a lennard - jones glass under a null equivalent pressure density is also plotted , as well as the debye prediction eq .. the difference that appears between the debye s prediction and the computed vdos is clearly drawn in the inset of the fig.[fig1](b ) , where the ratio between both quantities depicts a bump around @xmath54 , to which is associated the boson peak anomaly .",
    "also drawn on this fig.[fig1](b ) are the estimated contribution of longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) pulsations @xmath55 for the characteristic size @xmath36 of the elastic heterogeneous domains , already discussed in the previous sec.[subsec : summary ] .",
    "it then appears that the boson peak regime can be well approximated by the lower bound pulsation @xmath56 of transverse waves associated with eh .",
    "the last point discussed in the previous sec.[subsec : p_vdos ] is more precisely approached on the fig.[fig4](a ) and ( b ) . on these figures , for both glasses the boson peak pulsation @xmath57 measured on the fig.[fig1 ] is plotted in comparison to the pulsations @xmath58 for transverse and longitudinal elastic waves and for different pressures , i.e. using @xmath59 . note that from previous studies , the characteristic sizes of eh for both glasses has been found to decrease and saturate at high pressure . on this figure ,",
    "the power - law variation of the boson peak position @xmath60 with @xmath61 , as predicted by the soft potential model ( spm ) @xcite , is also drawn .",
    "our results seem to follow the expected @xmath62 variation from spm , thus assuming that bulk modulus are pressure independent .",
    "for instance , in the case of silica , this situation is not fulfilled in the compression elastic regime .     from fig .",

    "this emphasizes previous results @xcite : _ (",
    "i ) _ the response of a glass to a long wavelength excitation is dominantly transverse and leads to the creation of noisy rotational atomic rearrangements , _ ( ii ) _ the characteristic size @xmath1 of these structures decreases and saturates at high pressure , _ ( iii ) _ the boson peak is sited close to the resonant regime of transverse vibrational modes interacting with these structures or in other worlds of pulsations associated with their characteristic size .",
    "this last point is mainly phenomenological , but it bridges the scale between the mechanical properties of glasses and their vibrational spectrum .",
    "in the next section , we ll go deeper in this understanding by bridging the scale to the vibrational eigenvectors .",
    "as discussed in sec.[subsec : vmodes ] , the vibrational eigenvectors in the framework of the continuous elasticity theory are plane waves . in a disordered glassy material , one can expect plane waves in the highest wavelength limit , while things may be more complicated with the decrease of the wavelength .",
    "nevertheless , recent progress in computer simulations and experimental techniques have provided new insights in the understanding of this problem .",
    "for instance , in silica glasses @xcite , it has been shown that acoustic phonon waves undergo a crossover between a propagation regime and another in which they are strongly diffracted .",
    "this crossover corresponds to the ioffe - regel limit where the phonons mean free path is of same order than their wavelength @xcite , while the boson peak has been found to be closely related to this crossover frequency .",
    "it then appears that the boson peak seems to be more or less located in a region close to the ioffe - regel crossover @xcite , with wave excitations of predominantly transverse character .",
    "recently , numerical studies @xcite have been employed to confirm this last point , by computing the dynamic longitudinal and transverse structure factors ( only the former is accessible experimentally in the studied frequency range ) from the knowledge of particle trajectories . in @xcite , the authors also showed using per particle vdos , that transverse modes involved in the boson peak are associated with defective structures in the materials .    in order to connect previous works related with eh in two - dimensional lennard - jones glasses ( lj2d ) @xcite and their characteristic size @xmath36 ,",
    "the problematic is here approached by the use of the eigenvectors and their interaction with such specific zones .     from eq .",
    ", for two lj2d systems under different densities .",
    "the corresponding pressure states are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "only the first @xmath66 eigenvectors were used for this plot , and the boson peak pulsation @xmath67 from fig.[fig1](b ) is also plotted .",
    "the change in the participation regime trend is marked by the boson peak pulsation , measured on the vdos .",
    ", width=321 ]    to this aim , we first analyse the participation ratio of eigenvectors along the vibrational spectrum .",
    "this one is obtained by computing the quantity :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 are the eigenvectors for a pulsation mode @xmath70 under an overall hydrostatic pressure @xmath61 or density @xmath71 .",
    "when a mode is delocalized and then most of atoms vibrate to the corresponding pulsation @xmath70 , @xmath72 , however , if the mode is localized , then few atoms participate to the mode and @xmath73 .",
    "the participation ratio is plotted on the fig.[fig5 ] for two density values corresponding to a free @xmath74 state and a strongly compressed one with @xmath65 . on this figure",
    ", it appears that @xmath75 decreases from a full atomic vibrational participative state to a lower one that is stabilized around @xmath76 over the studied pulsation range .",
    "let us remind that for the @xmath77 sample , the debye pulsation is around @xmath78 .",
    "then , one may expect for higher pulsations @xmath75 to tend to @xmath79 . a crossover appear in @xmath80 at a pulsation close to the boson peak one ( measured using the vdos ) which means that around the boson peak , a clearly non - null amount of atoms participate to the vibrational states .     for different glass densities in 2d . for each density ,",
    "the measured boson peak pulsation @xmath67 is marked with a vertical arrow , while the vertical dashed line is the value of the pulsation @xmath81 that would have a transverse wave of wavelength of the same size than @xmath82 .",

    "this means that the plane wave picture used to describe eigenvectors is more and more lost when the mode index increases , or at least that as soon as the mode index increases , more and more neighbouring waves pollute the ideal theoretical plane wave which should represent the @xmath88 mode .",
    "this can be more clearly seen by computing the noise in eigenvectors from eq .. results are shown on the main panel of the fig.[fig6 ] for three different hydrostatic pressures .",

    "this type of plot should then encourage to view the boson peak anomaly as a process that results from the existence of a characteristic length , itself inherent from the competition between ordering and frustration in glassy materials .",
    "during this work , we have extended to the pressure dependent regime , previous studies on a prototypical two - dimensional soft glass former .",
    "taking advantage of known results concerning its mechanical response to a macroscopic excitation , and the relation it exists between the involved specific _ non - affine _ atomic displacements ( which are connected with the existence of eh ) and its vibrational spectrum , we have developed an additional point of view on the boson peak scenario .",
    "this one has been achieved by studying the interplay between the vibrational eigenvectors and the well characterized eh , for this kind of system under continuous compression .",
    "we have demonstrated that eigenvectors with wavelengths larger than the eh characteristic size can be well approximated by plane waves , as predicted by the continuum theory of elasticity .",
    "conversely , when the wavelength becomes of same order than this characteristic size , a crossover occurs and the plane wave framework no more holds .",
    "hence , elastic waves are strongly scattered by the eh , while this crossover is marked by the boson peak pulsation , that also coincides with the ioffe - regel limit .",
    "we have also shown that the boson peak pulsation shifts with the pressure on a same way than the pulsation of transverse elastic waves of wavelength of same size than eh , for both soft lj and strong silica glasses .",
    "this results confirms the fact that , whatever the pressure , the boson peak is always sited close to the _ non - affine _ regime , where the response of the system to a large wavelength excitation is self - organized in a collective manner and in such a way that it emerges a characteristic length as the result of the competition between order and frustration in glasses .",
    "then , we also pointed out that the pulsation shift of the boson peak is directly related to the increase of the speed of sound for transverse elastic waves .",
    "it follows that the boson peak can be indeed viewed as the result of a length , which might be related to this emerging length .",
    "a part of this work was also devoted on the preliminary study of the pressure dependence of the eigen - frequencies of a silica glass , a strong glass former .",
    "the density of state of such a glass was computed for various pressures , while the mechanical response of this glass to a macroscopic elongation was also performed in a parallel independent study , in order to extract the characteristic size of eh .",
    "we have then measured a decrease and a saturation of this characteristic length with increasing pressure . by the same way",
    ", it has been also possible to extract the inter - tetrahedral reciprocal rotations in response to the macroscopic deformation .",
    "the number of identical rotations has been shown to dominate the opposite ones when the pressure increases , which can be explained by a decrease of inhomogeneous moves , on the same manner than eh do .",
    "the decrease of the boson peak intensity and its shift are usually explained by a suppression of modes responsible for the boson peak .",
    "another explanation could be based on the variation of inhomogeneous moves and eh when the pressure increases , as in the case of the soft lj glass former .",
    "hence , compiling these results with the ones obtained from the vibrational spectrum , it has been shown that the boson peak frequency follows the same pressure dependence than that of transverse elastic waves with frequency associated with the eh characteristic size measured in that glass .",
    "this corroborates results from the simple two - dimensional soft lj glass former , and should encourage to extend the methodology developed for the eigenvectors study , to the case of the silica glass .",
    "the task is much more harder computationally , as one has to consider systems with a large amount of particles in order to get rid of finite size effects @xcite",
    ". it should be also interesting to have a more precise look at the involved structural changes when the pressure increases , and how they could be related with elastic heterogeneities .",
