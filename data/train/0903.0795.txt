    "the random - field ising model ( rfim ) at zero temperature has been proposed as a prototype for a broad class of disordered systems ( random magnets , glasses , plastic and ferro - elastic materials , fluids in porous media ... ) which exhibit an intermittent , avalanche - like , and hysteretic response to a smoothly varying applied force@xcite .",
    "the rfim has also been used in several socio - economics contexts to simulate collective effects induced by imitation and social pressure@xcite .",
    "a remarkable prediction of the model is the existence of a non - equilibrium critical point ( for a certain amount of disorder ) which separates two different regimes of avalanches . in the strong - disorder regime ,",
    "all avalanches are of microscopic size and the saturation hysteresis loop ( e.g. magnetization @xmath0 versus magnetic field @xmath1 ) is macroscopically smooth . at low disorder ,",
    "a macroscopic avalanche occurs at a certain field , which results in a jump discontinuity in the magnetization . at criticality ,",
    "avalanche sizes and durations follow power - law distributions .    in the original version of the model@xcite ,",
    "spins obey a standard single - spin - flip ( glauber ) relaxation dynamics at @xmath2 and align with their local effective field . as the applied field is slowly increased or decreased , a spin may become unstable and then trigger an avalanche that propagates until another metastable state is found .",
    "the field is held fixed during the propagation of the avalanche , which corresponds to the so - called `` adiabatic '' limit .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the time for local equilibration ( the duration of an avalanche ) is much smaller than the rate of change of the driving field .",
    "moreover , by using a deterministic zero - temperature dynamics , one assumes that no thermally activated escape takes place on the observational time scale ( `` athermal '' limit ) .",
    "these two assumptions are reasonable in many physical situations but they are never _ fully _ satisfied .",
    "it is thus interesting to test the robustness of the predicted scenario ( in particular the existence of a disorder - induced phase transition and its universality ) with respect to a slight violation of these conditions .    in a recent work@xcite ,",
    "the influence of partial equilibration processes was mimicked by changing the dynamics and allowing two neighboring spins to flip cooperatively . as expected , this change resulted in a reduction of hysteresis ( as the set of two - spin - flip stable states is contained in the set of one - spin - flip stable states ) and an enhancement of large - scale collective effects@xcite .",
    "but , remarkably , the critical behavior ( characterized by various exponents and finite - size scaling functions ) remained identical . in the present work ,",
    "we want to go in the opposite direction by _ enlarging _ the set of visited microscopic states so to increase hysteresis and drive the system further from equilibrium .",
    "this is done by allowing a small fraction of the spins to point in the opposite direction to their local field . however , in order to keep things as simple as possible ( and , in particular , to keep the simplifying separation of motion between adiabatic driving and avalanche propagation ) , we will still use a single - spin - flip dynamics and start an avalanche when some threshold in energy is reached . as a consequence , the saturation loop will not be an `` extremal '' path in the field - magnetization plane@xcite and the property of return - point memory@xcite will be violated .",
    "the main question that we want to address is : will this change the universal properties of the critical behavior ?",
    "note that this modification of the dynamical rule may be viewed as a crude way of simulating the effect of a finite driving rate which does not give enough time to the system to relax , even locally @xcite .",
    "but this is of course a caricature of what happens in the real world and we therefore do not pretend to propose here a theory of dynamic hysteresis , a topic that has been ( and still is ) intensively investigated in the literature@xcite . in a socio - economic context , one could also interpret this model as simulating an effect of `` inertia '' that prevents the individual agents to make their decision ( e.g. , buy or sell ) when the incentive reaches the threshold value .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe the model and the new dynamics , and discuss some of its properties . in section [ hysteresis ] , we study the hysteresis loops , in particular the change in coercivity .",
    "avalanche distributions are analyzed in section [ avalanches ] and the critical behavior in section [ critical ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the rfim on a three - dimensional cubic lattice of linear size @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions . on each site @xmath4 there is a spin variable @xmath5 .",
    "the energy of the system of @xmath6 spins is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a ferromagnetic exchange interaction constant and the first sum runs over nearest - neighbor pairs . without loss of generality",
    ", we will take @xmath9 .",
    "the set of random fields @xmath10 is drawn independently from a gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath11 , and @xmath1 is a uniform external magnetic field which couples to the overall magnetization @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .    the energy change associated to the reversal of spin @xmath4 then reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local effective field acting on spin @xmath4 , and @xmath16 is a nearest - neighbor of @xmath4 .    at @xmath2",
    "the standard single - spin - flip dynamics consists in flipping a spin if this lowers its energy .",
    "a configuration is thus single - spin - flip stable if every spin is aligned with its local field , _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 each of these metastable states has a certain range of stability @xmath18 .    as the field @xmath1 is slowly changed , a spin flips ( either upwards or downwards ) when its local field changes sign , which may induce a whole avalanche of other spin flips . in the adiabatic limit @xmath1 is held constant during the propagation of the avalanche .",
    "the avalanche stops when a new metastable state is reached .",
    "a nice feature of this dynamics is that it is `` abelian '' : because of the so - called `` no - passing '' rule@xcite , the metastable state reached at the end of an avalanche is independent of the order in which unstable spins have been reversed . in consequence",
    ", these spins can be flipped either sequentially or in parallel ( this latter choice having the advantage that one can define the duration of an avalanche ) .",
    "we now modify this dynamical rule by allowing a certain number of spins to be unstable ( eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is then violated ) .",
    "this can be done in various ways , for instance by imposing that the fraction of unstable spins can not exceed a certain value .",
    "this , however , would prevent the system to reach saturation .",
    "we therefore prefer to compute the extra amount of energy associated to the unstable spins and impose that an avalanche starts when this contribution exceeds some fixed threshold @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , the system may visit spin configurations that we call `` @xmath19-stable '' and that satisfy @xmath20 where the sum runs over all unstable spins , i.e. spins for which @xmath21 ( note that @xmath19 is an intensive quantity ) .",
    "there are now two conditions for an avalanche to start : ( i ) there must be unstable spins ( ii ) the sum of the extra contributions to the energy due to the unstable spins must exceed the threshold ( in absolute value ) . when increasing ( resp .   decreasing ) the field , only negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) spins contribute to this energy .",
    "one of course recovers the usual dynamics for @xmath22 .",
    "it is quite obvious that this modification of the dynamics spoils the no - passing rule and the abelian property .",
    "therefore , since several spins may be unstable when the energy threshold is reached , one needs to specify the order in which these spins are flipped .",
    "the natural choice that we adopt is to flip the most unstable spin first , that is the one that corresponds to the most negative @xmath23 .",
    "we then update the local fields while keeping @xmath1 constant , search again for the most unstable spin , flip it , etc .",
    ", until eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] is satisfied@xcite .",
    "this `` greedy '' algorithm essentially amounts to performing a steepest descent path in energy , which defines a deterministic sequence of unstable states inside an avalanche ( defined as usual as the collection of spins which flip at the same field ) .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that the order in which the spins are flipped along the hysteresis loop _ does not _",
    "depend on @xmath19 , so that the sequence of visited states is invariant .",
    "changing @xmath19 only changes the values of the external field at which the states are reached or left . more generally , in any monotonous field history from a state with magnetization @xmath24 to a state with magnetization @xmath25",
    ", the sequence of visited spin configurations does not depend on @xmath19 , but the corresponding fields may differ . as a result ,",
    "avalanches may split or merge when changing @xmath19 so that their number and size also change .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we compare the hysteresis loops obtained for @xmath22 and @xmath26 in a small size system .",
    "one can see in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ( c ) that the spin configurations at a given magnetization @xmath24 are identical although the hysteretic trajectories are different .",
    "[ fig1](b ) also shows that a state which is not single - spin - flip stable for @xmath22 ( as it is located in the middle of an avalanche ) is `` @xmath19-stable '' for @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , the opposite situation is observed .",
    "the fact that the modified dynamics does not satisfy the no - passing rule has two consequences .",
    "firstly , there can exist @xmath19-states outside the hysteresis loop@xcite .",
    "secondly , the property of return - point memory ( rpm ) is not satisfied , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . however , the violation of rpm is small for the values of @xmath19 considered in this work and it seems that this property is better and better verified as the system size increases .",
    "one can also see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the first - order reversal curves have a linear portion : when reversing the field ( for instance from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) , the negative spins that were unstable at @xmath27 become stable again before any positive spin becomes unstable and eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] is only violated when @xmath29 .    as a final remark in this section , we compare the proposed dynamics with the algorithms that have been used previously to study the t=0 rfim with a finite driving rate@xcite .",
    "the most common strategy consists in increasing the field in finite steps @xmath30 , thus merging all the avalanches occurring within that field window into a larger avalanche@xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetization loops then share a series of common points with those obtained with the adiabatic driving . on the other hand , in our case",
    "avalanches not only merge but also split and the resulting loops differs everywhere from the adiabatic ( @xmath22 ) loops .",
    "a second strategy@xcite consists in performing an exact simulation of the continuous @xmath31 signal by using a finite driving rate and defining a time interval associated to the shell of spins that relax in parallel .",
    "but one then needs to fix a threshold to define the avalanches and this has a strong influence on their size@xcite .",
    "this problem does not occur in the modified dynamics that we used here since there is still a complete time - scale separation between the field driving and the propagation of the avalanches .",
    "we first consider the influence of @xmath19 on the shape of the hysteresis loops for different values of the disorder strength @xmath32 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the results obtained by averaging over different disorder realizations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as expected , the main effect of @xmath19 is to bring the system further away from equilibrium and to increase hysteresis . for @xmath33 for instance , the loop area , which represents the energy loss , increases by @xmath35 when increasing @xmath19 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "this is already an important variation and in the following we shall restrict our study to the range @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig3 ] also shows that there are still two different regimes when @xmath39 and that the shape of the loops changes from smooth to rectangular as @xmath32 decreases . in particular , at low disorder",
    ", there is a single avalanche that spans the whole system at a certain value of the external field ( note that the spanning avalanche in a finite system occurs with no collective precursor for @xmath40 , which may change its nature .",
    "this is also a reason to restrict our study to smaller values of @xmath19 ) .    to further quantify the influence of @xmath19 on the hysteresis",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the variation of the coercive field @xmath41 for different values of the disorder .",
    "we find that the data are quite accurately fitted by the equation @xmath42 with @xmath43 in the large - disorder regime and @xmath44 at low disorder@xcite .",
    "the same dependence is found for the variations of the loop area with @xmath19 .",
    "so far , we have no convincing theoretical explanation for this behavior . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that the same exponent @xmath45 in the low disorder regime has been observed in a simulation study of the rfim under a linear driving rate@xcite ( in that study , however , there is no clear scaling at large disorder ) . in two dimensions@xcite , when varying the field in small steps as in ref .",
    ", simulations show a crossover from a square - root to a linear dependence of @xmath41 with the rate as the disorder is increased , in agreement with the behavior observed in ferromagnetic thin films .",
    "the rfim with the standard ( @xmath22 ) dynamics displays a power - law distribution of avalanche sizes at a critical disorder @xmath46@xcite . depending on the method used to extrapolate the numerical results to the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the value of @xmath47 varies from @xmath48 @xcite to @xmath49 @xcite . in this section",
    "we study the behavior of the avalanche size distribution for @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the avalanche size distribution @xmath51 obtained in a system of size @xmath52 for @xmath53 and various disorders @xmath32 when sweeping through a half - loop .",
    "the same behavior as for @xmath22 is observed : for large @xmath32 the distribution is exponentially damped whereas for small @xmath32 there is a peak at large sizes due to avalanches with characteristic size @xmath54 .",
    "these spanning avalanches are responsible for the macroscopic discontinuity in the hysteresis loop . between these two regimes",
    ", there is a value of @xmath32 for which the distribution is very well approximated by a power - law up to the trivial cutoff size @xmath55 ( and apart from some corrections at very small @xmath56 ) .",
    "this `` critical '' value of @xmath32 changes with @xmath19 but the slope of the power - law region appears to be invariant , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , .",
    "we view this result as a first indication that there exists a critical disorder @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit and that the power - law exponent @xmath58 that characterizes the avalanche size distribution at criticality@xcite does not change with @xmath19 ( note that the numerical value obtained in a finite system may differ from the actual value @xmath59 in the thermodynamic limit , as estimated in ref .  ) . in the next section we present a finite - size scaling analysis that will corroborate this statement .",
    "note that this result contrasts with the one that has been obtained in previous studies using a finite driving rate @xcite . indeed , when the only effect of the finite driving rate is to merge small avalanches into larger ones , the power - law exponent decreases .",
    "it is in fact unclear if such a decrease is due to the actual out - of - equilibrium behavior or is induced by the approximate treatment of the avalanche merging phenomenon and/or by the definition of the threshold that allows to discriminate the avalanches .",
    "the analysis of the spanning avalanches has proven to be a successful way to determine the values of several critical exponents in the rfim with the standard metastable dynamics@xcite .",
    "indeed , the statistics of spanning avalanches in finite systems contains information about the percolating fractal avalanches in the thermodynamic limit which are the signature of criticality . in this section",
    "we use a finite - size scaling method to study the effect of @xmath19 on the critical behavior of the model .    with the modified dynamics ( @xmath50 ) an avalanche still involves a connected set of spins and the spanning avalanches can be defined as usual : avalanches that span the whole system in @xmath60 , or @xmath61 spatial dimensions",
    "are referred to as 1d- , 2d- , and 3d - spanning avalanches , respectively .",
    "we focus our analysis on the average number of 1d- and 2d - spanning avalanches occurring along the lower branch of the hysteresis loop , which we call @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we discard from our analysis the 3d - spanning avalanches , which contain information not only about the critical percolating avalanches , but also about the compact infinite avalanche that gives rise to the first - order discontinuity in the low - disorder regime@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] illustrates the behavior of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as a function of @xmath32 for @xmath53 and different system sizes ( the data correspond to averages over typically @xmath64 disorder realizations ) .",
    "one can see that both functions exhibit a peak whose height increases with @xmath3 .",
    "moreover the peak position shifts and its width reduces . these features are clear signatures of the existence of an infinite number of percolating avalanches at a certain critical disorder @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are thus expected to have the scaling form@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are finite - size scaling functions , @xmath68 is some analytical function of the distance to the critical disorder , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are critical exponents that characterize the divergence of the number of spanning avalanches and of the correlation length , respectively .",
    "although the function @xmath68 can be approximated to first - order as @xmath71 , previous studies @xcite suggest that higher order terms are necessary to produce good scaling collapses . therefore , as in ref .  , we shall use @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a nonuniversal parameter that may depend on @xmath19 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the best choice was found to be @xmath74 .",
