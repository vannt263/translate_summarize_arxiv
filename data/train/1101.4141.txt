    "several experiments have been carried out in the last decade in liquid sodium at high magnetic reynolds numbers and in highly turbulent flows .",
    "measurements of magnetic field fluctuations , either due to an externally imposed magnetic field or due to magnetic field generated through a dynamo effect by the sodium flow itself , generally reveal spectra with a @xmath0-noise at low frequency @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows showed the same phenomenon @xcite although sometimes the precise form of the low frequency noise varies @xcite .",
    "the precise value of the exponent in the algebraic decay in a spectrum is not so important , but a behavior other than white noise , i.e. colored noise , always invites closer inspection @xcite .",
    "for example , a @xmath0-noise , frequently called flicker noise , can not extend down to zero frequency if the power integral is to stay finite .",
    "the low frequency cutoff to the @xmath0-spectrum should carry some informations about the dynamics of an mhd dynamo .",
    "measurements of velocity in a fixed point of a turbulent flow frequently find white noise at low frequency ( see for example the data compilation in fig",
    ". 6.14 of @xcite ) , but there are also examples of colored noise @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous presence of colored noise in both magnetic and velocity spectra looks like a plausible combination : if flow velocities increase in a dynamo , the magnetic field is amplified more rapidly and the amplitude of the magnetic field increases .",
    "if the velocity has no white noise , so should the magnetic field have a nontrivial spectrum . in the karlsruhe experiment on the other hand",
    "@xcite the @xmath0-fluctuations in magnetic signals had no correspondence in pump pressures or volumetric flow rates .",
    "this prompts us to investigate in more detail the mechanisms leading to colored noise in magnetic spectra .",
    "this paper will deal with the fluctuations of total magnetic energy , which is a global measure of the field amplitude .",
    "a theory for the fluctuations of a global quantity is of interest even though laboratory experiments usually report local measurements .",
    "numerical simulations always compute total magnetic and kinetic energies .",
    "their statistics are less noisy than those of field amplitudes at a given point because of the spatial averaging inherent to the computation of total energies .",
    "spectra of the geomagnetic field are frequently plotted as variations of another global quantity , the dipole moment @xcite , because the geomagnetic field is dominated by the dipole component and low frequency variations reflect variations of the dipole moment .",
    "secular variations of the earth s magnetic field again exhibit colored noise @xcite . in astrophysics , we do have local measurements of solar magnetic fields , but we only know a global amplitude for most stellar magnetic fields .    the goal of this paper is to explore conditions leading to colored noise in the total magnetic energy and to show that this type of noise can appear even if the kinetic energy has white noise",

    ".      mean field magnetohydrodynamics have proven a most fruitful simplification of the induction equation @xcite . in this approach , the effect of small scale fluctuations on the large scales are not computed exactly but are modeled , in the simplest case as an @xmath6effect .",
    "the number of magnetic degrees of freedom which need to be retained is thus reduced and in an extreme simplification , only one mode remains .",
    "if we call @xmath7 the amplitude of that mode , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the coefficients describing the @xmath6effect and its quenching , respectively , and @xmath10 a coefficient related to the magnetic dissipation , the simplest model reproducing the main features of the induction equation is : @xmath11 @xmath12 is allowed to be time dependent in order to reflect a time dependent velocity field",

    "we also would like to check whether it was reasonable in section [ single ] to assume a spectrum for @xmath29 which is flat at low frequencies and steeper at large frequencies .",

    "we will employ this phenomenology in a cartesian domain with periodic boundaries , so that it is useful to expand all fields in fourier series .",
    "much effort has been spent in the past to theoretically deduce the wavenumber dependence of the fourier coefficients , the best known theory being of course k41 .",

    "this implies that the histogram of the fluctuations in every mode has the same shape if the fluctuations are given as multiples of the mean amplitude .",
    "we then have to conclude that the root mean square of the fluctuations scales the same as the mean amplitude , i.e. is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that @xmath77 .",
    "note that it is not possible to deduce the scaling of @xmath75 from the usual dimensional arguments of k41 .",
    "the ratio @xmath78 tends to zero if the number of modes in a wavevector shell tends to infinity because the fluctuations of the modes in that shell average out to zero .",
    "the rms of the total fluctuation depends therefore on the number of degrees of freedom , which in turn depends on the ratio of integral to dissipative length scale .",
    "these two length scales are assumed to be irrelevant in the k41 theory , however .",
    "the energy of the modes in the wavevector shell of radius @xmath67 is now written in the form @xmath79 in which @xmath80 has to obey @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the fourier transform of the fluctuations of the total energy is @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "we now use again the hypothesis of self - similarity and note that the typical time scale for a mode with wavenumber @xmath71 is its turn - over time which is proportional to @xmath85 @xcite . restricting ourselves to frequencies @xmath44 and wavenumbers @xmath67 in the inertial range",
    ", we expect @xmath86 with an unknown but universal function @xmath87 .",
    "the form of the argument reflects that all @xmath88 should have the same form once @xmath44 is expressed in multiples of the turn - over frequency , and the amplitude factor @xmath89 follows from the requirement that @xmath90 , which implies that @xmath91 is a constant independent of @xmath67 . substituting @xmath92 into @xmath93 shows that this is indeed fulfilled .",
    "we can now proceed to finally compute the spectrum of the energy fluctuations , using the same substitution @xmath92 , to find : @xmath94 the spectrum of the energy fluctuations , i.e. the square of the fourier spectrum above , must thus decay as @xmath40 for @xmath44 in the inertial range .",
