    "ordered arrays of spins , called spin lattices , can form a magnetic state when surrounded by conduction electrons .",
    "such systems are normally characterized by two energy scales .",
    "first , the kondo temperature @xmath0 , which is the coupling of conduction electrons to localized spins . and second , ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) indirect exchange @xmath1 , which is the pairwise interaction between localized spins .",
    "a mean to investigate the magnetic state of the spin lattice is non - equilibrium transport spectroscopy , where a system with @xmath2 shows a resonance in differential conductance @xmath3 at zero source - drain bias ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , which we call type - i zero bias anomaly ( zba ) . with interacting spins @xmath5 ,",

    "such a tunig has recently been shown in an @xmath13 lattice of spins , that was reported to exist in high mobility modulation doped two dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) @xcite .",
    "theoretically , spin lattices are often analysed in a `` two - impurity '' kondo model @xcite , where the effect of perpendicular magnetic field , and its effect on the magnetic state via the orbital phase of the electrons that couple the spins , is not included .",
    "however , even in two spin systems , @xmath1 is strongly influenced by the nature and extent of confinement of the intervening fermi sea , and the orbital phase of itinerant electrons @xcite .",
    "we investigate such influence by application of a small transverse magnetic field on a quasi - regular two - dimensional array of localized spins , embedded within a sea of conduction electrons .",
    "we show that the magnetic state is extremely sensitive to perpendicular field @xmath14 , and the orbital phase of the itinerant electrons .",

    "( e ) non - equilibrium conductance evolution of typical type - ii zba over low perpendicular magnetic field ( red : high / blue : low @xmath3 ) . around the commensurability condition @xmath38 ( white line ) ,",

    "@xmath14 forces conduction electrons on paths with cyclotron radii @xmath40 , and electrons aquire additional phase @xmath39 , see fig .",
    "when @xmath41 , electrons from one localized spin are focussed on the next , and vice versa , which can be seen as an enhancement of overall zba magnitude , and of fluctuations in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we show such commensurability behaviour in a surface plot of the non - equilibrium conductance over @xmath14 , up to 105 mt for a typical type - ii zba , see fig .",

    "( [ deltaphi ] ) is , that small fields ( @xmath52 ) can only decrease @xmath1 , but not increase it from the zero field value . a type - i zba with @xmath53",
    "would then show ab oscillations , but have no @xmath21 modulation over @xmath14 .",

    ", low perpendicular field can not change the magnetic state of a spin lattice with @xmath53 .",
    "please note that in our system the background disorder plays a critical role in the arrangement of the localized spins .",
    "while the origin of the localized spins is not fully understood yet , periodic tunability of @xmath21 seems to be only possible in a certain window of disorder .",
    "unintentional disorder can lead to additional scattering of electron trajectories in @xmath14 , which suppresses clear observation of @xmath14-tuning of @xmath21 . even in the same device ,",
    "about 25% of electron densities displayed no periodic modulation of @xmath21 with @xmath14 , even though the oscillation in @xmath21 as a function of @xmath55 at @xmath56 was clearly observable .",
    "at low temperatures non - equilibrium conductance spectroscopy in low perpendicular magnetic fields is used to analyse the magnetic state of a spin lattice .",
