    "for example with respect to @xmath573 , the hyperedge @xmath91 is internally inactive and its favorite is @xmath90 . since a transfer of valence at @xmath573 from @xmath91 to @xmath90 results in @xmath578 , the corresponding feeler connects @xmath598 to @xmath599 . in @xmath346 ( cf .  ) , the @xmath89-coordinates of the emerald markers dilated from @xmath598 and @xmath599 are both @xmath600 , and the @xmath89-coordinates of the points corresponding to @xmath601 and @xmath602 are both @xmath603 , cf .   and , whereas any point along @xmath604 has @xmath89-coordinate @xmath605 ( @xmath242 is parametrized by weights on the edges of @xmath253 and along @xmath346 , the sum of the weights on edges adjacent to the same violet vertex has to be @xmath606 ) .",

    "* example 7.2 ) ) that in the interior polynomial @xmath610 of either hypergraph that @xmath0 induces , the coefficient of @xmath611 is @xmath612 . on the other hand ,",

    "it is in fact possible to give a proof of the classical saalschtz formula using the point of view of this paper but without relying on the interior polynomial and theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "let us consider the following concrete triangulation of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we denote the color classes of @xmath0 by @xmath615 and @xmath616 .",

    "we call a subgraph of @xmath0 _ non - crossing _ if the straight line segments in our figure that represent its edges only intersect at endpoints .",
    "the maximal simplices that correspond to two non - crossing spanning trees share a common facet if and only if the two trees differ by a single ( obviously defined ) ` @xmath617 transition . '",
    "a non - crossing spanning tree can be uniquely described by a _ zigzag _ , that is a non - crossing path in @xmath0 containing the leftmost edge @xmath618 and the rightmost edge @xmath619 . here",
    "the zigzag is a subgraph of the corresponding tree and the degree @xmath225 vertices of the zigzag are exactly the @xmath620 vertices of the tree .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the collection of simplices in @xmath621 that correspond to non - crossing spanning trees is a shellable triangulation . for example , it is not hard to verify that the hypertree order induces a shelling order .",
    "it is also not hard to show that in order for a simplex to have @xmath21 adjacent ( through a facet ) simplices that are smaller in the shelling order , its zigzag has to have exactly @xmath21 degree @xmath225 vertices among @xmath622 .",
    "once we have fixed those , the zigzag will be uniquely determined by the choice of its @xmath21 degree @xmath225 vertices among @xmath623 .",
    "hence we see that there are @xmath624 such trees and therefore follows by the argument outlined in remark [ rem : shell ] .",
    "the version of saalschtz s identity can be derived in essentially the same way , by counting interior lattice points in @xmath625 with the help of the same triangulation as above , using the process explained at the beginning of this section .",
    "now that we know that the interior polynomial is not just an invariant of a hypergraph but actually an invariant of the underlying bipartite graph , it becomes an interesting problem to express individual coefficients directly in terms of the graph ( i.e. , without either breaking the symmetry between the color classes or using the root polytope ) .",
    "as we recalled ( and re - proved ) in remark [ rem : coefficients ] , such formulas are known @xcite for the constant term ( which is always @xmath66 ) and the linear coefficient ( which is the first betti number ) . here",
    "we present one for the quadratic coefficient .",
    "[ pro : a_2 ] let the connected bipartite graph @xmath0 have first betti number ( nullity ) @xmath628 and let it have @xmath629 cycles of length four .",
    "then the quadratic coefficient @xmath325 in the common interior polynomial of the hypergraphs induced by @xmath0 is @xmath630 .",
    "let the color classes of @xmath0 be @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the formula gives @xmath631 , where @xmath459 is the dimension of the root polytope @xmath13 , @xmath321 is the number of edges in @xmath0 , and @xmath632 is the number of @xmath66-dimensional simplices in an arbitrary triangulation of @xmath13 . since @xmath633",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath634 . in other words",
    ", we wish to prove that in any triangulation @xmath297 of @xmath13 , the set of pairs of vertices that are not connected by an edge in @xmath297 is in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of four - cycles of @xmath0 .",
    "any pair @xmath635 of edges of @xmath0 is disjoint from @xmath636 ( or @xmath637 , if @xmath375 and @xmath411 share an endpoint ) star - cuts .",
    "the supporting hyperplanes of these cuts ( as in lemma [ lem : support ] , but this time let us take their intersections with the affine hull of @xmath13 ) intersect in an affine subspace . ] , which in turn intersects @xmath13 in the convex hull of @xmath225 , @xmath97 , or @xmath98 vertices . indeed , if @xmath375 and @xmath411 are adjacent then there are no other edges connecting their endpoints",
    ". otherwise , there may be one or two such additional edges , the latter case being when @xmath375 and @xmath411 are opposite edges along a four - cycle .",
    "( as @xmath0 is bipartite and does not have multiple edges , there may be at most one such four - cycle . )",
    "therefore the segment in @xmath13 determined by @xmath375 and @xmath411 is either an edge of @xmath13 and hence part of @xmath297 , or a diagonal of a quadrilateral ( in fact , square ) face of @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath297 induces triangulations of all faces , exactly one of the two diagonals will be a one - simplex in @xmath297 .",
    "finally , square faces of @xmath13 are in a bijection with four - cycles of @xmath0 : we saw how a four - cycle gives rise to a square face and conversely , the four vertices of a square are affinely dependent , i.e. , the four corresponding edges form a cycle .    regarding our two running examples , @xmath81 has nullity @xmath638 with @xmath97 four - cycles , implying @xmath639 .",
