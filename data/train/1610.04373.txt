    "dense pyroclastic flows are fast - moving density currents emitted by volcanoes that are particularly destructive .",
    "they are composed of high temperature crushed rocks ranging in size from micrometers to meters .",
    "they are granular flows but they show a very high fluidity : flows thinner than one meter can reach run - out distances longer than 10 kilometers and they are able to flow on horizontal surfaces .",
    "one objective of modern volcanology is to better understand the behavior of this type of flows for a better assessment of volcanic hazards .",
    "a possible explanation of the high mobility is the interaction between the fine particles of the flow and volcanic or atmospheric gases .",
    "some physical experiments have been made on the collapse of a fluidized dense granular column in a u - shaped channel , see for instance  @xcite or  @xcite . in these experiments , the granular bed is initially fluidized by injection of air through the column , which generates high interstitial pore fluid pressure so that the released granular material flows like an inertial single - phase fluid . in this context",
    ", a lot of mathematical models have been proposed to take into account the change of rheology all along the flow : @xcite .",
    "a first category concerns bi - fluids systems , in which each phase is described by a navier - stokes type equation added to a coupling term ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an important problem with this kind of model is their heaviness in terms of numerical computations .",
    "this is why plenty of models are of shallow - water type , provided the length of the flow is much bigger than the thickness , see  @xcite .",
    "this method allows to reduce a @xmath0-dimensional problem to a @xmath1-dimensional one , and is then much more efficient for computational experiments .",
    "but the cost is the loss of information in the direction which seems to be crucial to understand the behavior of fluidized granular flows . in order to overcome the problems above it is possible to consider a homogeneous incompressible fluid with a rheology depending on a parameter ( called _ order parameter _ in @xcite ) , which is supposed to satisfy an equation describing its evolution .",
    "for such a model , the equations governing the hydrodynamics are the navier - stokes equations including an extra - stress tensor .",
    "they read @xmath2 where  @xmath3 is the velocity , @xmath4 the pressure and  @xmath5 is the extra - stress tensor .",
    "the vector  @xmath6 characterizes the gravity forces , the coefficient  @xmath7 refers to the newtonian viscosity and  @xmath8 is the constant density of the mixture .",
    "note that the constant density of the mixture can be expressed as the linear combination of the constant density of each component of the mixture : @xmath9 where  @xmath10 is the constant density of the gas ,  @xmath11 the constant density of the solid particles and  @xmath12 is the mass fraction of gas in the mixture . in order to take into account the behaviour of dense granular flows ,",
    "the extra - stress  @xmath5 depends not only on the symmetric part of the velocity gradient  @xmath13 but also on an order - parameter  @xmath14 evolving with the flow ( _ cf _ @xcite ) : @xmath15 more precisely , the function  @xmath5 is defined using a bingham type relation : @xmath16 where for any tensor  @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in other words , we want to impose a solid behaviour when the stress is smaller than a plasticity yield , named  @xmath14 . in the model presented in this paper ,",
    "contrary to the ones in  @xcite , the order - parameter depends on the interstitial pore fluid pressure , denoted by  @xmath19 .",
    "it means that in this model the gas present between solid particles only acts on the global dynamic _ via _ its local pressure .",
    "more precisely , our order parameter is in fact the plasticity yield defined as a function of the difference between  @xmath19 and a solid pressure  @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 this choice means that when the fluid pressure compensates the solid pressure then the mixture is newtonian ( @xmath22 ) , whereas when fluid pressure is lower then plasticity effects happen ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the model must be completed by the relation giving such pressures  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath24 let s begin with the pore fluid pressure  @xmath19 .",
    "as in  @xcite , some experiments show that , in the static case , the evolution of this pressure is given by a diffusion law . to understand what happens in a flowing case , one can follow iverson and denlinger s inference , which gives an advection - diffusion law for the behaviour of the basal pore pressure in a shallow - water type model , see  @xcite .",
    "same phenomenological observations allow us to say that the fluid pressure  @xmath19 verifies , in our model , an advection - diffusion equation like : @xmath25 @xmath24 we assume that the solid pressure  @xmath20 only depends on the gravity . more precisely , it corresponds to the pressure that imposes a column of grain particles anywhere in the bed",
    ". then it can be explicitly defined as the lithostatic solid pressure , _ i.e. _ @xmath26 where  @xmath27 is a reference pressure given at the altitude  @xmath28 ( @xmath29 begin the vertical coordinate ) .",
    "note that there are three pressures in the model : @xmath20 is the lithostatic ( or hydrostatic ) pressure , @xmath19 is the pressure of the gas which fills the gap between solid particles , and @xmath4 is the hydrodynamic pressure of the mixture . as a result , in the particular case of a static state of the solid matter , @xmath4 equals @xmath20 . in  @xcite",
    ", this solid pressure represents the minimum fluidization pressure measured on the base of a static grain column during its fluidization .",
    "more precisely , this is the pressure of the gas once the velocity of injection is sufficient to impose an upward drag force which counterbalances the weight of particles .",
    "but there is no _ a priori _ relation between @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath4 in the general case .",
    "finally , the dynamic of such a fluid is governed by a system of three equations with three unknowns :  @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath19 , which is @xmath30 & \\partial_t p_f + v \\cdot \\nabla p_f - k \\ , \\delta p_f = 0 , \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where  @xmath20 is the function given by   and  @xmath31 is a source term taking into account all exterior forces , for instance the gravity forces when  @xmath32 . in the case where the solid pressure and fluid pressure are equal ( @xmath33 )",
    "then we obtain a pure viscous flow ( modeled by the incompressible navier - stokes equations ) .",
    "if the difference between these two pressures is assumed to be constant then we obtain the classical bingham model .",
    "these two regimes are already well known , see for example  @xcite . in order to solve the existence problem for such complex fluids ,",
    "a general theory has been developed and studied in  @xcite , in which the authors prove the existence of a weak solution for a general class of rheology including fluids of a bingham and herschel - bulkley type and depending on both time and space . but this framework does not include our case based on coupling equations .",
    "+ in this article , we generalize these results to our physical model by treating the coupling relation through the definition of the order - parameter . even if the result given in  @xcite is true in the three - dimensional case , according to remark  [ 3d ] , we will restrict the study to the two - dimensional case in this article .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section1 ] , we introduce the mathematical formulation of the problem and give the main result : the existence of a weak solution .",
    "the section  [ section2 ] is devoted to the proof of this result : a construction of approximated solutions is given in the subsection  [ section2 - 1 ] .",
    "we next prove uniform estimates in the subsection  [ section2 - 2 ] , and we finally deduce the existence result using a limit process in the subsection  [ section2 - 3 ] . in the last section ,",
    "we give some numerical results on the classical poiseuille - type flow in a 2d - channel , that show the impact of the fluidization on the behaviour of a bingham fluid .",
