    "let @xmath2 be the smooth contractible @xmath1-manifold consisting of a single @xmath3- and @xmath4- handle attached as in figure 1 ( one of the mazur manifolds ) .",
    "the boundary is a homology sphere @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the obvious involution obtained by first surgering @xmath7 to @xmath8 in the interior of @xmath2 , then surgering the other imbedded @xmath8 back to @xmath7 ( i.e. replacing the dots in this involution interchanges the small linking loops of the two circles in figure [ mazur1 ] .",
    "it is known that this involution acts nontrivially on the donaldson - floer homology of @xmath0 , ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will show that the involution @xmath9 also acts nontrivially on the heegard - floer homology group @xmath10 of @xmath0 , which was defined in @xcite .",
    "we will deduce the proof from the construction of @xcite and the @xmath1-manifold invariants of @xcite .",
    "this gives a possible way of changing smooth structures of @xmath1-manifolds that contain @xmath2 ( such codimension zero contractible submanifolds are usually called `` corks '' , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and they can be made stein @xcite ) .",
    "by @xcite , the boundary of the @xmath1-manifold in the first picture of the figure [ mazur2 ] is the brieskorn homology sphere @xmath11 , which we can relate to @xmath0 as follows : the second picture of figure [ mazur2 ] is obtained by attaching a @xmath12 framed @xmath4-handle to @xmath2 , hence the boundary is @xmath13 ( since the @xmath14-framed @xmath4- handle slides over the @xmath12 framed handle , and cancels the @xmath3-handle ) .",
    "so , in this picture , @xmath15 is just a loop in @xmath13 , which is drawn nonstandardly .",
    "it is easily seen that in the standard picture of @xmath13 , the loop @xmath15 corresponds to the @xmath16 pretzel knot @xmath17 as shown in figure [ pretzel_knot ] ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that doing @xmath18 surgery to @xmath15 corresponds to doing @xmath19 surgery to @xmath20 in @xmath13 , which we will denote by @xmath21 .",
    "hence @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will use this identifications in the heegard - floer homology calculations of the next section .",
    "we first calculate the heegaard - floer homology of @xmath11 using techniques of @xcite , from this and the surgery exact sequence of @xcite we will deduce the heegaard - floer homology of @xmath0 .    from @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath11 is the boundary of the negative definite plumbing of disk bundles over @xmath4-spheres described by the following plumbing graph :    this graph is negative definite and has only one bad vertex @xmath25 in the sense of @xcite , i.e. , only @xmath26 \\cdot [ v_1 ] > -d(v_1)$ ] where @xmath27 counts edges containing @xmath28 .    in the notation of @xcite we write @xmath29 , and we compute @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a group which can be calculated by the algorithm of @xcite for negative definite ( possibly disconnected ) trees @xmath32 with at most one bad vertex . here",
    "we follow this algorithm ( for the terminology , we refer to @xcite ) :    first we need to find characteristic vectors @xmath20 satisfying @xmath33\\cdot[v ] + 2 \\leq \\langle k,[v ] \\rangle \\leq -[v]\\cdot[v ] .",
    "\\label{cond13 } \\ ] ]    we remark that there are only finitely many such vectors since @xmath32 is a definite graph , in particular there are @xmath34 characteristic vectors satisfying ( [ cond13 ] ) for the given graph .",
    "proposition 3.2 in @xcite characterizes a spanning set for @xmath35 which is the dual point of view for @xmath31 . among the 80 characteristic vectors satisfying ( [ cond13 ] ) we look for those vectors k which carry full paths ending at vectors @xmath36 for which @xmath37 satisfies ( [ cond13 ] ) .",
    "there are precisely three such vectors k and we list them and also the full paths for convenience ( paths are obtained by consecutively adding @xmath38 for the numbers @xmath39 listed ) :    [ cols=\">,^ , < , < \" , ]     all other equivalence classes in @xmath35 can be obtained using the @xmath40-action from these vectors .",
    "we must check which are distinct . from now on ,",
    "we will write the vectors as @xmath41-tuples with entries @xmath42 \\rangle $ ] , hence @xmath43 will be denoted as @xmath44    the following diagram shows how @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equivalent to @xmath48 , and hence to each other :    in the above figure , vertices correspond to characteristic vectors and an edge ending with a number @xmath39 means @xmath38 was added to previous vector to reach the new one .",
    "edges with positive slope mean tensoring with @xmath40 .",
    "hence first diagram represents the vectors @xmath49 which tells us that @xmath50    hence each @xmath43 lies on the same grading level and we can check this by calculating @xmath51 which gives zero for each @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we conclude : @xmath52 by prop 7.11 of @xcite we can convert this to the heegard - floer homology of @xmath53 : @xmath54 to do this , we first use the following long exact sequence to compute @xmath55 :    @xmath56    then we adjust gradings by changing the signs and substracting @xmath57 .",
    "note that here we adapted the convention of @xcite by denoting @xmath58 .",
    "so we have : @xmath59    @xmath60 .",
    "let us consider the heegard - floer homology long exact sequence of @xcite for the @xmath16 pretzel knot @xmath61 : @xmath62 recall that the middle two arrows in the sequence decrease the gradings by @xmath63 . since @xmath64 we know @xmath4 out of @xmath65 terms of the exact sequence , from this we can compute the third term @xmath66 , as shown in the diagram :    @xmath67    now by plugging in this value of @xmath68 in the heegard - floer homology exact sequence of the knot @xmath20 in @xmath69 below ( this time involving @xmath70 , @xmath14 , and no surgeries ) , we calculate the heegard -floer homology of @xmath71 to be @xmath72 @xmath73    in these calculations we used the fact that all the groups are equipped with @xmath40-action ( an action of @xmath74 $ ] which lowers the grading by @xmath57 ) , and the maps are equivariant with respect to this action .    also we used two additional facts , which were explained to us by p. ozsvth : the lower left map @xmath75 of the first diagram is nonzero , and the lower right map @xmath76 of the second diagram is zero .",
    "explanation : by using theorem 1.4 of @xcite and theorem 6.1 of @xcite we can calculate @xmath77 independently , and by the exact sequence and the fact that @xmath78 has to lower the degree by @xmath63 implies that @xmath78 must be nonzero .",
    "the map @xmath76 is zero because it is obtained by summing over the maps induced by a cobordism @xmath79 with @xmath80 structures @xmath81 ( extending the one on the boundary ) .",
    "@xmath82 has signature @xmath70 and there are two such @xmath83 structures which cancel each other .",
    "let @xmath84 be the punctured @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "we want to compute the map induced by the cobordism @xmath84",
    "@xcite @xmath86    @xmath2 consists of @xmath87 with a @xmath4-handle attached . by turning @xmath2",
    "upside down we see @xmath84 is a union of cobordisms @xmath88 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , and @xmath91 from @xmath92 to @xmath69 ( a 3-handle ) .",
    "hence we have the decomposition @xmath93 .",
    "the map @xmath94 is well understood , it is obtained by the projection @xmath95 the second map is @xmath40-equivariant , in particular it maps the lowest degree generator @xmath96 of @xmath97 to the lowest degree generator @xmath98 of @xmath99 .",
    "so it is sufficient to understand the map @xmath100 .",
    "notice @xmath101 is obtained by attaching a @xmath4-handle to @xmath102 along the loop @xmath103 with @xmath14-framing ( see figure [ surgery_on_delta ] ) .",
    "denote the manifold obtained from @xmath0 , doing @xmath104-surgery to @xmath103 , by @xmath105 .",
    "note that @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the second manifold of figure [ surgery_on_delta ] , which we will call @xmath108 to simpilfy the notation .",
    "we can write the corresponding heegard - floer homology exact sequence of @xmath109 :    @xmath110    @xmath111 is just the first map in the exact sequence , to compute it we need to know the third term in the sequence . to calculate @xmath112 we use the heegard - floer exact sequence of the knot @xmath113 of figure [ surgery_on_beta ] .",
    "@xmath114 it is easy to check that @xmath115 is the manifold obtained by @xmath14-surgery to the figure eight knot , and @xmath116 is @xmath117 . in @xcite , @xcite homologies of these",
    "were computed : @xmath118 and @xmath119 . by plugging these to the last exact sequence we compute @xmath120        by plugging the value @xmath121 in the previous exact sequence ( [ delta_surgery_exact_seq ] )",
    "we see that the map @xmath122 is given by the obvious projection and the inclusion ( where the middle map is an @xmath40-equivariant isomorphism ) @xmath123 hence the map @xmath124 is given by the obvious projection @xmath125",
    "let @xmath82 be the @xmath126 surface constructed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath127 decomposes as the union of two codimension zero submanifolds glued along their common boundries @xmath128 where @xmath2 is the mazur manifold of figure 1 , furthermore by identifying @xmath129 and @xmath2 via the involution @xmath130 ( instead of the identity ) gives the decomposed manifold @xmath131    now let us remember the @xmath1-manifold invariants of @xcite : let @xmath132 be a smooth closed 4-manifold with a @xmath83 structure @xmath81 such that it is decomposed as a union of two codimension zero submanifolds glued along their boundaries @xmath133 with @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "call @xmath136 . by puncturing each @xmath137 in the interior",
    "we get two cobordisms : @xmath138 from @xmath69 to @xmath108 , and @xmath139 from @xmath108 to @xmath69 .",
    "induces a well defined map : @xmath144 .",
    "then the ozsvth - szab invariant @xmath145 is the degree of this map on @xmath146 generator ( in particular the invariant does nt depend on the splitting of @xmath147 ) .",
    "by @xcite , @xcite we know that this invariant is zero on @xmath148 while it is non - zero on @xmath149 ( actually to get this conclusion we also need to show that either the homotopy @xmath126 of @xcite is diffemorphic to actual @xmath126 , or directly apply the technique of @xcite to show that it has nonzero invariant - either way works . ) .",
    "also , since this invariant is independent of splittings , we can further split @xmath150 as shown in figure 8 , and decompose @xmath151    we can view the manifold @xmath152 as being obtained from @xmath153 by cutting it along @xmath0 and sticking in the cobordism manifold @xmath154\\cup_{f}\\sigma\\times [ 1/2,1]$ ] .",
    "also the involution @xmath9 induces a map @xmath155 via the cobordism @xmath156 , ( @xmath157 in @xcite s notation ) .",
    "so the nonzero invariant of @xmath127 is obtained by computing the degree of the map : @xmath158 ( where @xmath159 is some map and the second map is the projection ) whereas the zero invariant of @xmath160 is obtained by computing the degree of the map : @xmath161    note that since @xmath156 is diffeomorphic to the product @xmath162 $ ] the @xmath40-equvariant map @xmath163 should look like the identity map . at first glance",
    "this appears to contradict the above result .",
    "the explanation is that , the two ends of @xmath156 are different copies of @xmath0 , only when we fix the both ends by a reference copy of @xmath0 , then @xmath163 becomes an isomorphism permuting two of the zero degree generators of @xmath164 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath163 permutes the zero degree generator of @xmath165 with one of the generators of the remaining @xmath166 .",
    "so , actually @xmath163 is only a @xmath40-equivariant isomorphism , which happens to differ from the identity isomorphism .",
    "hence we proved : @xmath6 induces a nontrivial involution @xmath167 .",
    "if @xmath168 is any smooth cobordism from @xmath69 to @xmath0 with @xmath83-structure @xmath81 , and @xmath169 , then ozsvth - szab procedure gives a map @xmath170 .",
    "previous theorem gives a potential way of detecting exotic smoothings of @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "let @xmath171 be a smooth closed @xmath1-manifold with @xmath172 ( the union is taken along the common boundary @xmath0 ) .",
    "let @xmath173 be the cobordism from @xmath69 to @xmath0 obtained from @xmath129 by removing a copy of @xmath174 from its interior .",
    "then the manifold @xmath175 is a fake copy of @xmath176 , provided that the image of the map @xmath177 lies in @xmath99 for some @xmath81 .    _",
