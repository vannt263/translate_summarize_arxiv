    "heavy quarks are a powerful tool to investigate initial state effects and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "initial state nuclear effects can alter the number of heavy quarks produced compared to extrapolations from collisions .",
    "once produced , however , the number of heavy quarks is preserved in strong interactions in the medium .",
    "final state effects , such as energy loss in the qgp @xcite , can only modify the momentum distribution of these quarks and open heavy meson . on the other hand , the number of prompt is not expected to be preserved in the medium because of the low @xmath10 binding energy , which can allow the to be broken by medium interactions .",
    "the b mesons which decay to , which subsequently decays into a dimuon pair , represent a relatively clean channel to extract @xmath11-quark yields .",
    "the phenix forward silicon vertex detector ( fvtx ) along with the central silicon vertex detector ( vtx ) provide the ability to measure precise event vertex positions as well as track displacement from the reconstructed event vertex .",
    "this allows for the statistical separation of from b - meson decays from prompt .",
    "the phenix muon detector acceptance for b mesons in this channel is nearly constant over all transverse momenta , allowing for the direct extraction of momentum integrated @xmath11-quark yields , corresponding to the number of @xmath11 quarks in the rapidity acceptance . with these yields",
    ", we can verify whether initial state effects are relevant to b - meson production in nucleus+nucleus collisions .",
    "the only known source of nonprompt is production via b - meson decay @xcite , which has a typical decay time @xmath121.51.6 ps @xcite .",
    "the constituent bottom quarks have mass @xmath134.5 and are created from processes such as gluon fusion ( @xmath14 ) , flavor excitation where heavy quarks ( @xmath15 ) from the nucleon wave function scatter with gluons ( @xmath16 ) , and gluon splitting ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "gluon - gluon fusion and flavor excitation are equally dominant whereas the gluon splitting contribution is small at @xmath18200 gev according to pythia8 hard scattering simulations @xcite .",
    "initial state effects on the precursor gluons , before their hard scattering , include coherent multiple scattering , also called dynamical shadowing @xcite , incoherent multiple scattering @xcite , initial state energy loss @xcite , and saturation of small momentum fraction @xmath19 gluons @xcite .",
    "nuclear parton distribution functions , extracted from deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan experimental data , such as eps09 @xcite and impact - parameter - dependent eps09s @xcite , indicate a pattern of suppression for small-@xmath19 gluons and an enhancement of intermediate to large-@xmath19 gluons .",
    "semi - leptonic decays from inclusive heavy flavor measured in @xmath20@xmath21au collisions at @xcite indicate yield suppression at forward rapidity , where bjorken @xmath22 gluons dominate .",

    "a similar enhancement was observed in the measurements of @xmath24 mesons in @xmath20@xmath21au at midrapidity @xcite .",
    "asymmetric cu+au collisions have the advantage of being a relatively large system which can access different @xmath19 regions at positive and negative rapidities .",
    "studies in these collisions provide a powerful test of how initial state effects observed in small systems , such as @xmath4@xmath25 , can be projected in large heavy ion collisions . in the phenix muon arms",
    ", positive rapidity corresponds to the cu - going direction , probing small-@xmath19 in the au nucleus and large-@xmath19 in the cu .",
    "negative rapidity covers the au - going direction , probing small-@xmath19 in the cu nucleus and large-@xmath19 in the au .",
    "initial state parton distribution modifications are predicted to be stronger in the au nucleus @xcite .",
    "if these modifications have the same pattern as seen in @xmath26+a collisions , they may cause suppression in the cu - going ( positive rapidity ) direction and enhancement in the au - going direction .",
    "initial - state energy loss @xcite also results in larger suppression at positive rapidity .    in this study",
    "we quantify the fraction of nonprompt muons from decay in and cu+au collisions at using the phenix muon arms measuring in the rapidity range @xmath27 .",
