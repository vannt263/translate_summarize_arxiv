    "in the last decade a series of ground - breaking experiments on the dynamics of cold atoms @xcite have generated new interest in the thermalization dynamics of quantum many - body systems . if a quantum many - body system is prepared in the ground state of a given hamiltonian @xmath0 and evolved according to a new hamiltonian @xmath1 , it is natural to ask whether the excess energy will redistribute among the elementary degrees of freedom and whether the system will eventually reach the thermal state at later times ( in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this expectation has been tested theoretically in pioneering works on this subject @xcite , partially confirming the idea that non - integrable quantum many - body systems thermalize , in the sense that observables of physical interest appear to reach asymptotically the value predicted by the gibbs ensemble with a temperature set by the energy injected in the system . a noticeable exception",
    "are integrable quantum many - body systems , which relax towards a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) , i.e. a grandcanonical ensemble which takes into account all the conserved quantities of the system @xcite .",
    "the simplest protocol to study non - equilibrium dynamics is the so - called _ quantum quench _ , which consists in preparing the system in the ground state of a quantum many body hamiltonian @xmath2 , and let them evolve according to a different hamiltonian @xmath3 , the control parameter @xmath4 being suddenly switched to @xmath5 .",
    "though , the most recent developments in out - of - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many body systems have been mainly concerned in understanding which is the asymptotic steady state attained after a quantum quench , ( for a complete review on this subject , see for instance @xcite ) , it is still not clear what are the time scales of thermalization , whether the process of thermalization is sudden or composed by many stages , and which are the mechanisms behind thermalization in quantum many - body systems .",
    "recent theoretical studies of quantum many body systems weakly perturbed away from integrability suggests that first the system relaxes towards a _ pre - thermal state _",
    ", where the expectation values of observables are predicted by a modified gge ( strongly influenced by the close integrable point  @xcite ) and only later when inelastic scattering becomes relevant the system departs from the pre - thermal state approaching the asymptotic thermal state .",
    "this phenomenon known as _",
    "prethermalization _ has been studied in many systems of physical interest , ranging from quantum field theories @xcite , to the hubbard model @xcite , luttinger liquids @xcite , spinor condensates  @xcite and non - integrable versions of the quantum ising chain @xcite .",
    "signatures of this crossover have been observed experimentally in split one dimensional condensates  @xcite .",
    "while it is evident that the dynamics of thermalization will in general display various crossovers , it is not clear whether this is a general phenomenon , what are the conditions for its observability and what are going to be its signatures in observables of physical interest .    in this work",
    "we consider a quantum ising chain ( qic ) perturbed by a time - dependent delta correlated noise in the transverse field direction , and driven out of equilibrium by a quench of the static component of the transverse field .",
    "even though in the last years the non - equilibrium dynamics of a qic has been studied in great detail theoretically @xcite , recently the quench dynamics of a model in the ising universality class has been realized experimentally in an ensemble of tilted one - dimensional atomic bose - hubbard chains @xcite , making this problem of potential interest also for experimental studies .",
    "morevoer , recently , the out of equilibrium dynamics of noisy hamiltonians has been studied for trapped bosons and luttinger liquids @xcite and previously , in the framework of open quantum systems , the interplay of many - body interactions , dephasing and dissipation has been studied for spin chains coupled to classical and quantum uniform noise @xcite or to a bosonic bath @xcite . as shown by us in a previous work @xcite , the noisy qic displays _ prethermalization _ in the time evolution of observables of physical interest ( e.g the transverse magnetization ) .",
    "more specifically , the dynamics in this model has two stages @xcite : first the system relaxes towards the gge of the unperturbed ising chain through inhomogeneous dephasing ( analogue to dephasing occuring in a ising chain after the sudden quench of the transverse field ) ; only later noise - induced effects occur , suppressing exponentially fast in time the coherences and subsequently heating the system towards the asymptotic thermal state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the system from a complementary point of view , i.e. looking at the statistics of the work done while performing the out of equilibrium protocol discussed above .",
    "we consider the probability distribution function of the work done on the system , @xmath6 , ( which received an increasing interest in last few years in the domain of quantum quenches @xcite ) , for static and time - dependent noisy out of equilibrium protocols .",
    "we show that in contrast to the noiseless case where a low energy threshold appear with a characteristic edge singularity @xcite , a sudden quench of the qic with a static random transverse field drawn from a gaussian distribution function smooths out all non - analyticies in the disorder averaged @xmath6 ( though a definite singularity remains in every realization ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistics of the work done on an ising chain with a time dependent noisy magnetic field affects in a time dependent fashion the spectral weight associated to the edge singularity , in a way analogous to what happens in the dynamics of the energy absorbed by the system , presented in @xcite and widely discussed in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and the out of equlibrium protocol ; in section iii we start the study of the system , looking at the effect of static and dynamical noise in the work done on a qic by a noisy protocol .",
    "section iv is devoted to the derivation and the solution of a kinetic equation , using the keldysh formalism and section v employs these results to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of physical observables in order to understand which are the processes and the time scales involved in thermalization dynamics .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our conclusions .",
    "appendix a is devoted to a generalization of bogolyubov transformations useful for the computation of @xmath6 , when a generic time dependent protocol is performed on the qic @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is in the out of equilibrium dynamics of a qic , described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the integrable quantum ising chain and @xmath9 is a time - dependent gaussian white noise , with zero average and amplitude @xmath10 , @xmath11 here @xmath12 are the longitudinal and transverse spin operators at site @xmath13 and @xmath5 is the strenght of the transverse field .",
    "the qic is among the simplest , yet non - trivial integrable many - body system , whose static properties @xcite and quench dynamics @xcite are to a great extent known .",
    "it is characterized by two dual gapped phases , a quantum paramagnetic ( @xmath14 ) and ferromagnetic one ( @xmath15 ) separated by a quantum critical point located at @xmath16 . in the following we assume @xmath17 and we restore it in the computations only when it is necessary .",
    "the spin hamiltonian is unitarily equivalent to spinless fermions , @xmath18 , as can be shown by performing a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , i.e. defining @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes in fourier space , @xmath21 , the simple form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the nambu spinor @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the pauli matrices in the 2@xmath282 nambu space .",
    "the diagonal form @xmath29 , with energies @xmath30 , is achieved after a bogoliubov rotation @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; the coefficients are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the qic can be diagonalized in terms of free fermions , whose mass is the gap of the theory @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we will consider the dynamics for the following out of equilibrium protocol : at time @xmath36 the system is prepared in the ground state of @xmath8 with a certain value of the transverse field @xmath4 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . at later time , @xmath39 the system is evolved according to the full hamiltonian @xmath40 ( see ) with a different value of the transverse field @xmath5 , as portrayed in fig.1 .     out of equilibirum protocol studied in this paper for the qic :",
    "the system is prepared in the ground state of the ising chain with @xmath41 and is evolved according to the ising hamiltonian with a different value of the transverse field @xmath14 , plus a gaussian delta - correlated noise on top of it . for simplicity , both @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are chosen within the paramagnetic phase . ]    a sudden quench of the transverse field populates all excited states of the system , injecting an extensive ammount of energy ; this is easy to understand by looking at the populations and the coherences immediately after the quench . in the basis of the bogolyubov fermions diagonalizing @xmath3 :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , the intial state can be written as a coherent superposition of pairs of quasiparticles created on the vacuum of the theory after the quench @xcite ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath45}.        \\end{split}\\ ] ]    below we will focus on the interplay between the effect of a sudden quench of @xmath5 and the time dependent noise driving the dynamics of the system .",
    "the effect of a quantum quench and , generally speaking , of an out - of - equilibrium protocol on a quantum many body system is usually highlighted studying the time dependence of correlation functions of local operators , as we are going to discuss extensively starting from section iv .",
    "however , since a generic non - equilibrium protocol , as a time dependent magnetic field @xmath46 in a quantum spin chain , can be seen as the quantum generalization of a thermodynamic transformation , it could be useful to characterize it studying the work @xmath47 done on our system upon performing the quench with the noise on the top of it . in a quantum non - equilibrium process @xmath47 fluctuates among different realizations of the same protocol @xcite and its description requires the introduction of a probability distribution @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "work is a fundamental observable in classical and quantum thermodynamics and should be experimentally accessible by spectroscopic methods , as it has been recently pointed out @xcite .",
    "let us start our analysis by considering the statistic of the work done on a quantum many body system after a quantum quench , @xmath6 characterized by a generic non - equilibrium protocol @xmath46 .",
    "this quantity requires two energy measurements : one at the initial time , @xmath49 , and one at the final time @xmath50 ( for a comprehensive review on the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the final energy is measured with respect to the final hamiltonian , @xmath51 , and that for each realization of the out - of - equilibrium protocol the work @xmath52 is given as a difference of the outcomes of the two measures of the energy at initial and final time .",
    "the statistics of the work is then defined as @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the initial state of the system , @xmath57 is the evolution operator from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the instantaneous wave - functions , computed from the equation @xmath61 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the characteristic function @xmath62 contains full information about the statistics of the work @xmath52 and can be written as a two time correlation function @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the final hamiltonian used in the final measurment in the heisenberg picture . for a sudden quench it follows immediately that @xmath65 where @xmath2 and @xmath66 are the initial and final hamiltonian respectively .",
    "one may compute exactly the statistics of the work for a generic time variation of the transverse field in the qic ( see appendix a and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for a sudden quench of the transverse field in the qic , one obtains for @xmath6 , at low @xmath52 , a peak located at @xmath67 , i.e. the difference in the ground states energies before and after the quench , plus a continuum starting above @xmath68 , describing pairs of quasi - particles .",
    "this continuum displays an edge singularity with universal features @xcite . for sudden quenches within the paramagentic phase , one may obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the two - particle level spacing , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the heaviside step function @xcite .",
    "since the exponents of these singularities are expected to be universal @xcite it is natural to start our study of the effect of the noise by clarifying its role on the universal low - energy behaviour of the statistics of the work .",
    "we separate two effects : first we consider a quench with a final random value of the transverse field drawn from a gaussian distribution function and then a gaussian time - dependent delta correlated noise acting on the system during its time evolution till the measurement time @xmath50 . + as a warm up , let us start with the first case , a quench of the qic with a final value of the transverse field drawn from a gaussian distribution function , corresponding to a value of the final mass , centered in @xmath74 and with variance @xmath75 : @xmath76    we now want to compute @xmath77 averaged over this probability distribution .",
    "the average energy injected into the system through this quench is equal to the energy injected in a sudden protocol @xmath78 meaning that the noise affects the statistic of the work , @xmath77 , starting from the second and higher order moments . nevertheless , as shown below , the probability distribution ( averaged over disorder )",
    "is reshaped in the energy window of interest .",
    "we can study the statistics of the work by taking the average of over the gaussian distribution and assuming @xmath79 , @xmath80 , i.e. the fluctuations of the noise are small compared to the final gap and the amplitude of the quench .",
    "first of all , it is important to notice that the energy difference of the ground states @xmath81 , can be expressed as the difference in the ground states one would have without noise @xmath67 , plus an extensive correction proportional to the fluctuations @xmath82 : @xmath83 where we retained only the first order term of the expansion @xcite and @xmath84 is a complete elliptic function .",
    "the function @xmath85 @xcite can be expressed as a combination in the following way    @xmath86\\equiv l\\varxi(\\overline{g}).\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 is an hypergeometric function .",
    "below we focus on the _ average _ statistics of the work    @xmath88\\simeq \\\\ & \\simeq \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\omega^2}{2(\\gamma f(\\overline{g}))^2}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\gamma f(\\overline{g})}+ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\eta \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\eta^2}{2\\gamma^2}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\gamma}}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4}\\frac{\\theta(\\omega+f(\\overline{g})\\eta-2\\overline{\\delta}-2\\eta)}{\\delta}\\rho_-^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega+f(\\overline{g})\\eta-2\\overline{\\delta}-2\\eta}{\\overline{\\delta } } } \\end{split},\\ ] ]    where in the second line we assumed @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this formula contains two physical effects , the first one is a global fluctuation involving the shift of the ground state energy ( see eq . ) .",
    "this effect is proportional to the system size @xmath89 and affects in the same way both the delta peak singularity and the continuum starting at @xmath90 .",
    "the second effect is associated to the fluctuations affecting the masses of the quasi - particles emitted after the quench and it does not scale with the size of the system .",
    "if one is interested in measuring the work with reference to @xmath67 in an energy window close to @xmath91 , the first type of fluctuations are obviously dominant and most importantly detrimental .",
    "indeed , the last integral in eq . can be cast in the following form @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) . at energies around @xmath96 one",
    "would observe    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is a numerical prefactor and @xmath10 is the euler gamma function .",
    "it could be interesting to subtract these fluctuations by some means . in order to to",
    "so there are in principle two possibilities : the first one is to measure for each realization only the energy differences with respect to the threshold , subtracting the extensive shift of the ground state energy due to the noise ( see eq . ) ; the second one consists in rescaling the noise amplitude by the system size , @xmath99 . in both ways eq",
    "can be properly averaged in the energy range of interest . for @xmath100 @xmath101 which essentially means that well above the energy threshold for the production of pairs of quasi - particles in a sudden quench , the statistics of the work is left unchanged . on the other hand , for @xmath102 ,",
    "the statistics of the work displays a gaussian tail controlled by the renormalized noise amplitude @xmath103 , @xmath104 + let us now proceed our analysis considering more complicated effects .",
    "we prepare the system in the ground state of the ising chain in the paramagnetic phase , with @xmath41 and we let evolve the system under the generic time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath105 . in the following",
    "we assume that we have subtracted the shift of the ground state energy and that the amplitude of the noise has been rescaled .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that for each realization of the noise the square root singularity at the lower energy threshold is independent from the out - of equilibrium protocol performed on the qic @xcite ; what changes is the spectral weight of the singularity in @xmath6 , which in general will depend on the details of the time dependent quench , as discussed in appendix a. the expression of the statistics of the work in this case is @xmath106 where @xmath107+\\\\ & + \\big|\\int_0^\\tau\\frac{e^{2i\\int_0^tdt'\\delta(t')}}{\\delta(t)^2}\\dot{\\delta}(t)dt\\big|^2\\big ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath108 , where in general @xmath109 is different from @xmath110 .    the derivation of eq .",
    "is postponed in appendix a. using integration by parts , it is easy to show that @xmath111    when taking the noise average of these expressions there are going to be two separate effects .",
    "the first will consist in fluctuations of @xmath112 at the initial and final point of the trajectory which will produce consequences similar to the ones discussed above in the static case . if we think to the statistics of @xmath113 as being gaussian with : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a correlation time @xcite , the fluctuations at the endpoints have amplitude @xmath116 .",
    "now in the limit , @xmath117 , @xmath118 we argue that to the leading order the various terms in eq . can be averaged separately : @xmath119 while the average of the square root singularity will produce the smearing of the singularity described above",
    ", the average of the spectral weight will produce a time dependent prefactor that appears to describe the heating of the system under the influence of the noise . in order to average @xmath120",
    ", we first notice that for @xmath117 , @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 where crossed correlations with the boundary term proportional to @xmath123 can be neglected . indeed , expanding in taylor series the left hand side , we get @xmath124 and , taking the average over the noise , we finally have @xmath125 it should be clear that in the limit @xmath126 , @xmath121 , only the first term can be kept in the right hand side of .",
    "+ using eq . , eq . , and neglecting correlations coming from boundary terms , it is now straightforward to average over the noise ; for instance , for the second term in eq .",

    "+ hence , our result on the statistics of the work , @xmath131 , can be summarized in the following expression which contains a transparent physical meaning    @xmath132    where @xmath133    the long time growth of the spectral weight appears to indicate the continous heating of the system ( it resembles the time dependence of the energy absorbed by the system at the early stages of the dynamics , as it will be clear from eq . ) .",
    "notice indeed that the energy absorbed by the system during the time - dependent protocol @xmath46 is non zero , in sharp contrast to the static case , as we will show in section v. in the following we will study in more sophisticated quantities the interplay between dynamical noise and coherent effects due to a quantum quench of the ising chain .",
    "in this section we are going to study the kinetics of local observables and their correlation functions in the qic . in order to accomplish this task , we are interested in deriving a kinetic equation for the equal time non - equilibrium green s function for the protocol discussed in section ii .",
    "we will do so by deriving a master equation , using the keldysh contour technique , in order to obtain analitically an expression for the 2-point functions of bogolyubov fermions at equal time .",
    "these equations will then be used to compute all the observables of interest and their the out - of - equilibrium dynamics .",
