    "a topic of contemporary interest in nuclear physics is the investigation of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in a dense hadronic environment",
    ". such environment can be produced in the laboratory via energetic heavy ion ( hi ) collisions or can be found in astrophysical systems , particularly the interior of neutron stars . in all cases predictions rely heavily on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , which is one of the main ingredients for transport simulations of hi collisions as well as the calculation of neutron star properties .",
    "transport equations , such as the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation , describe the evolution of a non - equilibrium gas of strongly interacting hadrons . in buu - type models ,",
    "particles drift in the presence of the mean field while undergoing two - body collisions , which require the knowledge of in - medium two - body cross sections . in a microscopic approach , both the mean field and the binary collisions",
    "are calculated self - consistently starting from the bare two - nucleon force .",
    "we present microscopic predictions of nn cross sections in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter . in asymmetric matter",
    ", the cross section becomes isospin dependent beyond the usual and well - known differences between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 cases .",
    "it depends upon the total density and the degree of proton / neutron asymmetry , which of course also implies that the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 cases will in general be different from each other . in this paper",
    ", we will only be concerned with the the strong interaction contribution to the cross section ( coulomb contributions to the @xmath2 cross section are not considered ) .",
    "asymmetry considerations are of particular interest at this time .",
    "the planned rare isotope accelerator will offer the opportunity to study collisions of neutron - rich nuclei which are capable of producing extended regions of space / time where both the total nucleon density and the neutron / proton asymmetry are large .",
    "isospin - dependent buu transport models @xcite include isospin - sensitive collision dynamics through the elementary @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 cross sections and the mean field ( which is now different for protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the latter is a crucial isospin - dependent mechanism and is the focal point of an earlier paper @xcite .    in a simpler approach",
    ", the assumption is made that the transition matrix in the medium is approximately the same as the one in vacuum and that medium effects on the cross section come in only through the use of nucleon effective masses in the phase space factors @xcite . concerning microscopic calculations ,",
    "earlier predictions can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , but asymmetry considerations are not included in those predictions . on the other hand , it is important to investigate to which extent the in - medium cross sections are sensitive to changes in proton / neutron ratio , the main purpose of this paper .",
    "in - medium cross sections are necessary to study the mean free path of nucleons in nuclear matter and thus nuclear transparency .",
    "the latter is obviously related to the total reaction cross section of a nucleus , which , in turn , can be used to extract nuclear r.m.s .",
    "radii within glauber - type models @xcite .",
    "therefore , accurate in - medium _ isospin - dependent _ nn cross sections can ultimately be very valuable to obtain information about the size of exotic , neutron - rich nuclei .    in the next section , after providing some details on the calculation , we present and discuss our results .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section iii .",
    "details of our application of the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock framework to asymmetric matter can be found in ref.@xcite . we choose the bonn - b potential @xcite as our model for the free - space two - nucleon ( 2n ) force .    the nuclear matter calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite provides , together with the eos , the single - proton / neutron potentials as well as their parametrization in terms of effective masses @xcite .",
    "those effective masses , together with the appropriate pauli operator ( depending on the type of nucleons involved ) , are then used in a separate calculation of the in - medium reaction matrix ( or @xmath5-matrix ) under the desired kinematical conditions .",
    "our calculation is controlled by the total density , @xmath6 , and the degree of asymmetry , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the neutron and proton densities . for the case of identical nucleons ,",
    "the @xmath5-matrix is calculated using the appropriate effective mass , @xmath10 , and the appropriate pauli operator , @xmath11 , depending on @xmath12 , where @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for non - identical nucleons",
    ", we use the `` asymmetric '' pauli operator , @xmath15 , depending on both @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the variations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with increasing neutron fraction at three fixed densities , according to the relations @xmath18 @xmath19 this may facilitate the interpretation of results later on .    in the usual free - space scattering scenario ,",
    "the cross section is typically represented as a function of the incident laboratory energy , which is uniquely related to the nucleon momentum in the two - body c.m .",
    "frame , @xmath20 ( also equal to the relative momentum of the two nucleons ) , through the well - known formula @xmath21 . in nuclear matter , though , the pauli operator depends also on the total momentum of the two nucleons in the nuclear matter rest frame .",
    "this could be defined in some average ( density - dependent ) manner , or kept as an extra degree of freedom on which the cross section will depend .",
    "we will take the latter approach and examine this aspect in the next subsections .    another issue to consider carefully when approaching the concept of in - medium cross sections is the non - unitary nature of the interaction .",
    "due to the presence of pauli blocking , the in - medium scattering matrix does not obey the free - space unitarity relations through which phase parameters are usually defined and from which it is customary to determine the nn scattering observables . as done in ref .",
    "@xcite but unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the cross section directly from the scattering matrix elements thus avoiding the assumption of in - vacuum unitarity and its consequences ( such as the optical theorem ) .",
    "that is , we integrate the differential cross section @xmath22 where @xmath23 contains the usual sum of amplitudes squared and phase space factors .",
    "an alternative way would be to include pauli blocking in the definition of phase parameters @xcite .      as a baseline , we start by showing the @xmath2 cross section as a function of the momentum @xmath20 and at different densities of symmetric matter , see fig .  2 . until otherwise noted , we use in - vacuum kinematics to define the total 2n momentum in the nuclear matter rest frame ( that is , the target nucleon is , on the average , at rest ) .",
    "the range of momentum in fig .  2 corresponds to values of the in - vacuum laboratory energy between approximately 20 and 260 mev .    as compared to the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the use of the @xmath24-matrix approach imposes unitarity of the in - medium scattering matrix , the suppression of the cross section with increasing density is less pronounced .",
    "this was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and is most likely due to the different handling of the unitarity issue as noted above .",
    "overall , we find reasonable qualitative agreement with previous predictions .",
    "we also notice that the high - density cross section tends to rise again at large momenta , a behavior already observed in refs .",
    "@xcite particularly for the @xmath2 channel",
    ".    a simpler approach to calculating in - medium cross sections consists of scaling the free - space value according to the relation @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective mass . in fig .",
    "3 we compare this approximation with the predictions from our full calculation .",
    "we see that at low momentum , and particularly at the lower densities , the agreement is quite good , but it strongly deteriorates at higher momenta and densities .",
    "medium effects on the interaction are clearly important , particularly the interplay between the ( energy - dependent ) pauli blocking mechanism and the dressing of the quasiparticle due to the surrounding medium .",
    "we next examine the role of isospin asymmetry , the focal point of this paper . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the ratio of the in - medium cross section to the free - space one is shown for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 scatterings as a function of the asymmetry .",
    "the total density is fixed to its value near saturation and the momentum @xmath20 is chosen to be equal to the corresponding fermi momentum ( @xmath27=1.3 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath29 is generally weak , which may be attributed to the `` competing '' roles of the effective mass and pauli blocking . for the @xmath2 case , for instance , the smaller effective mass @xcite and the lower fermi momentum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) would tend to decrease and increase the cross section , respectively .",
    "the opposite happens in the @xmath3 case .",
    "for the momentum considered in fig .  4 , the role of the effective mass appears to be dominant , lowering the @xmath2 cross section and raising the @xmath3 one .",
    "this trend of the @xmath2/@xmath3 cross sections versus @xmath29 and relative to each other is in qualitative agreement with predictions based on scaling the cross section as in eq.(4 ) , with effective masses obtained from the modified gogny interation recently used in isospin - dependent buu calculations @xcite .",
    "figure  5 displays the cross section ratios for fixed values of the asymmetry and density but changing relative momentum .",
    "there , we see that the ratio approachs one in the high - momentum limit .    in fig .",
    "6 , the cross section ratios are shown as functions of the ( average ) fermi momentum but fixed asymmetry and @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is chosen as in fig .",
    "the cross sections are seen to go down rather quickly with increasing density but then rise again at the higher densities . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "this was already observed , particularly in the @xmath2 channel , in previous microscopic calculations of cross sections in symmetric matter @xcite . in this region of the phase space , disagreement with predictions based on eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xcite reflects the discrepancy already noted in the high - density part of the lower panel in fig .  3 .",
    "following up on the comments we made at the end of subsection iia , in the next figures we examine the impact of treating the 2n total momentum with respect to nuclear matter , @xmath30 , as an independent variable ( rather than linked to @xmath20 through the simplifying assumption of in - vacuum kinematics ) .    in fig .  7 , we show @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross section ratios under the same conditions of density and two - nucleon relative momentum as in fig .  4 but changing value of the total 2n momentum , @xmath30 .",
    "the general tendency seems rather independent of @xmath30 , although some minor differences can be seen with fig .  4 as well as among the three situations displayed in fig .",
    "in particular , we notice that for the lower values of @xmath30 the @xmath2 cross section shows a lesser tendency to decrease with increasing @xmath29 , and perhaps even a slight tendency to rise again .",
    "this may be understood in terms of pauli blocking , which becomes more important at lower values of @xmath30 and whose effect is opposite the one coming from the decreasing proton mass .",
    "next , to broaden our previous analysis , we show in fig .  8 and fig .",
    "9 situations analogous to those presented in fig .  4 and fig .  7 , respectively , but at a lower density .",
    "the chosen value of the average fermi momentum , which is also taken as the value of @xmath20 , corresponds to approximately one - half of saturation density .",
    "sensitivity to the asymmetry appears stronger at lower density , as seen from the more pronounced differences between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 curves in both fig .  8 and fig .",
    "similarly to what was done in fig .  2 for the @xmath2 case , we begin with showing in fig .  10 the basic density / momentum dependence of the @xmath0 cross section in symmetric matter .",
    "( in - vacuum kinematics is used at this point . )",
    "we notice here that the cross section at the density equivalent to @xmath27=1.1 @xmath28 shows some local enhancement which is considerably more pronounced than what can be seen in the @xmath2 case , see fig .",
    "this comparison suggests that enhanced attraction is generated at low density in the t=0 partial waves , most likely those with the quantum numbers of deuteron .    in fig .  11 , we explore more closely the dependence of these  structures \" on the kinematics",
    "the label `` fsk '' stands for free - space kinematics ( as was used in fig .",
    "10 ) , whereas the other three curves refer to different choices of the total momentum @xmath30 as indicated in the figure .",
    "clearly , the location of these enhancements is determined by the kinematics , moving to lower values of @xmath20 for higher values of @xmath30 .",
    "although noticible , these gentle fluctuations do not resemble at all the extremely large resonance - like peaks reported in some earlier works @xcite and interpreted as precursor of a superfluid phase transition in nuclear matter at particular densities / momenta .",
    "although crucial for generating those resonances in ref .",
    "@xcite was the inclusion of hole - hole scattering , other authors have reported large bound - state signatures even without hole - hole contributions @xcite .",
    "our predictions do not confirm those findings .",
    "very mild fluctuations are predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas no enhancements at all appear in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will focus next on the asymmetry dependence of the @xmath0 cross section . having observed in the previous subsection that asymmetry effects on protons and neutrons tend to move the cross section in opposite directions",
    ", we may reasonably expect very mild dependence on @xmath29 .",
    "this is indeed confirmed in fig .",
    "12 ( where in - vacuum kinematics is used ) , and fig .  13 ( where , as before , the sensitivity to the choice of @xmath30 is explored ) .    for in - medium @xmath0 scattering ,",
    "the nature of the cross section is the result of a subtle combination of multiple effects .",
    "these come from both the neutron and proton effective masses and the role of both the neutron and proton fermi momenta in the expression of the ( asymmetric ) pauli operator @xcite . in the end , the behavior versus @xmath29 is nearly flat , although a very slight tendency to rise can be identified , with the exception of the lower-@xmath30 curve in fig .",
    "we have presented microscopic calculations of cross sections for scattering of nucleons in neutron - rich matter .",
    "the sensitivity to the asymmetry in neutron / proton ratio comes through the combined effect of pauli blocking and changing effective masses .",
    "the lowering(rising ) of the proton(neutron ) fermi momentum and the reduced(increased ) proton(neutron ) effective mass tend to move the cross section in opposite directions . in the phase space regions we have examined here ,",
    "the general tendency is for the @xmath2 cross section to go down and the @xmath3 one to rise with increasing asymmetry .",
    "this indicates that the role of the effective mass is dominant over pauli blocking .    when both kinds of nucleons are involved , though , dispersive and pauli blocking effects on each type of nucleon result in large cancelations .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section is essentially @xmath29-independent , although minor variations can be seen depending on the kinematics .",
    "on the other hand , the basic density / momentum dependence of the @xmath0 cross section in symmetric matter appears rather interesting .",
    "different predictions disagree concerning the presence of large bound - state effects which might be associated with the onset of superfluidity .    in summary , sensitivity to the asymmetry can be non - negligible for scattering of identical nucleons .",
    "the degree of sensitivity depends on the region of the energy - density - asymmetry phase space under consideration .",
    "we conclude that the proton mean free path could be affected in a significant way by in - medium scattering , mostly through @xmath31 .    to test these findings",
    ", it is very useful to identify hi collision observables specifically sensitive to the two - body cross sections .",
    "possible probes of the isospin - dependence of the in - medium nn cross sections are presently being investigated @xcite . whereas traditional means such as measurements of the stopping power are found to be ambiguous with respect to determining isospin dependence , potential candidates include isospin tracers like the neutron / proton free - nucleon ratio in reactions induced by radioactive beams in inverse kinematics @xcite .",
