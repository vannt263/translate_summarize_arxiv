    "the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) waveband ( 150@xmath01200  ) contains emission lines formed at temperatures ranging from several times 10@xmath3 k to several times 10@xmath4 k and is therefore well suited for studies of the multithermal structures in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the solar euv research telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) sounding rocket payload @xcite was developed at nasa s gsfc to study the sun s corona and upper transition region with imaged euv spectra .",

    "eunis ( euv normal - incidence spectrograph ) is a next - generation euv imaging spectrograph that is 100 times more sensitive than serts , with @xmath55@xmath6 spatial resolution and @xmath52  s time cadence @xcite",
    ". this powerful instrument can pave the way for entirely new studies of the corona using high cadence spectra at a single location , rapid rastering over large 2d areas of the solar surface , or deep exposures on intrinsically faint coronal features .",
    "eunis has now been successfully flown twice , in april 2006 and november 2007 @xcite .",
    "scientific results have already been reported using the eunis-06 data .",
    "for example , @xcite found both upflows and downflows in a coronal bright point observed in emission lines formed at @xmath7=0.05@xmath02.5 mk , providing evidence for magnetic reconnection in bright points .",
    "@xcite further derived coronal electron densities , the differential emission measure , and elemental abundances of this bright point from line intensities .",
    "@xcite studied a cool transient event seen only in he with high - cadence spectra , revealing relative upflows up to 20 km  s@xmath8 which are consistent with gentle chromospheric evaporation .",
    "@xcite found short - period ( 26@xmath24 s ) velocity oscillations in the he 303.8   line and other transition region ( tr ) lines formed at temperatures up to 4@xmath910@xmath10 k and suggested an interpretation in terms of fast sausage modes in a flux tube .    for eunis-06 ,",
    "a complete end - to - end radiometric calibration of its long wavelength ( lw ) channel was carried out at the rutherford appleton laboratory ( ral ) in england using a stable euv transfer light source provided by the german physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to obtain a similar measurement of the eunis short - wavelength ( sw ) channel due to the weakness of available lines in that waveband . therefore , we have developed a technique for deriving the absolute radiometric calibration of its sw channel by combining measured lw solar spectra with density- and temperature - insensitive line intensity ratios .",
    "the procedure of using insensitive line intensity ratios to derive relative radiometric calibration was first suggested by @xcite and has been successfully applied in calibrations of serts and other instruments .",
    "eunis-06 was launched from white sands missile range , new mexico , at 18:10 ut on 2006 april 12 .",
    "it achieved a maximum altitude of 313 km and obtained solar spectra and images between 1812 and 1818 ut .",
    "eunis observed noaa ar 10871 ( s07@xmath11 , e28@xmath11 ) and ar 10870 ( s08@xmath11 , w02@xmath11 ) , the quiet region between them and a southern - hemisphere coronal bright point within the quiet area @xcite .",
    "coordinated observations were obtained with the euv imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ? * ) and the cds aboard @xmath1 , as well as with the _ transition region and coronal explorer _",
    "( @xmath12 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we coaligned the data from different instruments with a cross - correlation method , taking the eit images as a reference .",
    "the optical design of eunis is directly based on that of serts , but features two independent , imaging spectrographs , one covering euv lines between 300 and 370   seen in first order ( lw channel ) , and a second covering lines between 170 and 205   seen in second order ( sw channel ) . for both channels , the optical design of telescope , entrance slit , toroidal grating , and detector are identical , with the only difference being the multilayer coatings applied to the reflecting surfaces .",
    "each channel includes a microchannel - plate ( mcp ) intensifier section and a set of three 1k@xmath91k active pixel sensors ( aps ) , which are coupled to the mcp by fine - pore fiber - optic blocks .",
    "areas of the solar image selected by the two entrance apertures include a narrow 2@xmath13660@xmath14 slit along which spatially resolved spectra are obtained , and wider `` lobes '' at the ends from which spectroheliograms are obtained . for this flight",
    ", the lobe - slit fields of view were oriented east - west near the center of the solar disk .",
    "eunis has a first - order spectral dispersion of 25 m  pixel@xmath8 and a designed spatial scale of 0@xmath14.927 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "a more detailed description of eunis design was given by @xcite .",
    "for the first flight of eunis , its optics limited the actual spatial resolution to about 5@xmath14 and the measured spectral resolution was @xmath5200 and @xmath5100 m  fwhm in the lw and sw channels .",
    "in this first flight we obtained 80 solar exposures in `` stare '' ( fixed pointing ) mode at the start of the flight with @xmath52 s cadence for all but the first five ; further observations were made in scanning ( spectroheliogram ) mode .",
    "all of the raw data were processed with several routine adjustments , including dark image subtraction , flat - fielding and non - linearity correction .",
    "the quality of our eunis data is sufficient to reveal non - linearities in the aps response that reach about 15% as they approach saturation .",
    "this effect is identical for all aps units , and has been characterized by ratios of different exposure times to a constant euv source in the laboratory .",
    "appropriate corrections for the effect are applied to raw data to convert the recorded data numbers ( dn ) into relative exposure units ( reu ) , which are then used in all subsequent analyses .",
    "we used 34 exposures of the stare sequence to create an averaged lobe image for coalignments and an averaged spectral image for calibration .",
    "the cds includes a normal incidence spectrometer ( nis ) that can be used to obtain stigmatic euv spectra within its 308@xmath0381   ( nis-1 ) and 513@xmath0633   ( nis-2 ) wavebands along its 240@xmath14 long slit .",
    "several slit widths are available , the most commonly used being 4@xmath14 . the instrument can be operated in a sit - and - stare mode wherein successive exposures over small ( single slit ) areas are obtained , or it can be used to obtain raster images of target areas by obtaining spectra from successive slit pointings . in the latter case ,",
    "the cds scans a region of the sun from the west to east .",
    "since the cds pointing has no compensation for solar rotation during observations , the actual field - of - view ( fov ) of an obtained spectroheliogram will be stretched out in the x - direction when the targeted region is located on the solar disk . in this study ,",
    "the cds rastering observation was made during 17:10:10@xmath019:11:43 ut , consisting of 60 pointing positions .",
    "the fov is 264@xmath15 .",
    "the pointing difference between cds nis-1 and nis-2 has been corrected when applying _",
    "mk_cds_map _ in the solar software ( ssw ) idl library .",
    "we used the eunis lobe images to precisely coalign eunis data with full disk solar images obtained with eit .",
    "we first scaled the eit images to the same pixel size as eunis .",
    "we then coaligned the left lobe of an eunis image with the eit image by applying a cross - correlation technique .",
    "if the eunis image ( or slit ) is tilted to the east - west direction and its actual spatial scale is different from the design value , its right lobe will have offsets to the eit image that has been coaligned by the left lobe .",
    "so we can estimate the tilt angle of the eunis slit and actual spatial resolution from the measurements of these offsets .",
    "for the eunis sw channel , we measured the offsets of @xmath16=4.7 pixel in the @xmath17-direction and @xmath18=@xmath020.6 in the @xmath19-direction for the right lobe by comparing eunis fe @xmath20180 image with the eit @xmath20195 image .",
    "we then determined the actual pixel size from flight data by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the actual ( from flight measurements ) and designed ( nominal ) pixel sizes of eunis images , and @xmath24 is the distance in eunis pixels between two lobe regions used for coalignments .",
    "the tilt angle of the eunis image ( or slit ) can be determined by @xmath25 $ ] . from the solar measurements we obtained @xmath22=0@xmath14.922  pixel@xmath8 and @xmath26=1.4@xmath11 counterclockwise from the east - west .",
    "similarly for the lw channel , we measured the offsets of the right lobe by comparing eunis he @xmath20304 image with the eit @xmath20304 image , and obtained @xmath22=0@xmath14.927  pixel@xmath8 and @xmath26=1.0@xmath11 .",
    "the measurements also show that the eunis-06 sw and lw slits were not co - pointing in flight , but were instead separated by about 76@xmath14 in the @xmath19-direction ( fig .",
    "[ fgcln ] ) .",
    "we coaligned the cds images by comparing nis-1 mg @xmath20368 , si @xmath20347 , fe / fe @xmath20352 images with the eit @xmath20195 image , and comparing nis-2 he @xmath20584 image with the eit @xmath20304 image .",

    "figures  [ fgswmg ] and [ fglwmg ] show the eunis sw and lw channel images and their comparisons with the coaligned eit , trace and cds / nis images . a good agreement in their intensity profiles along two cuts in the lobe regions and along the eunis slit indicate that the images from the different instruments have been well coaligned .",

    "<S> then , theoretical insensitive line ratios obtained from chianti allow us to determine absolute intensities of emission lines within the eunis sw bandpass from those of cospatial cds / nis-1 spectra after the eunis lw calibration correction . a total of 12 ratios derived from intensities of 5 cds and 12 sw emission lines from fe@xmath0fe yield an instrumental response curve for the eunis-06 sw channel that matches well to a relative calibration which relied on combining measurements of individual optical components . </S>",
