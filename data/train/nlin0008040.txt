    "consider a system that is described by an hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 are canonical variables and @xmath2 is a constant parameter .",
    "our interest in this paper is in the case where @xmath1 describe the motion of a particle inside a cavity , and @xmath2 controls the deformation of the confining boundary .",
    "the 1d version of a cavity , also known as ` potential well ' , is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "however , we are mainly interested in the case of chaotic cavities in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "cavities in @xmath7 dimensions , also known as billiard systems , are prototype examples in the studies of classical and quantum chaos , and we shall use them for the purpose of numerical illustrations .",
    "the eigenstates of the quantized hamiltonian are @xmath3 and the corresponding eigen - energies are @xmath8 .",
    "the eigen - energies are assumed to be ordered , and the mean level spacing will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in the parametric kernel @xmath10 in the equation above @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the wigner functions that correspond to the eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the trace stands for @xmath14 integration .",
    "the difference @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "we assume a dense spectrum , so that our interest is in ` classically small ' but ` quantum mechanically large ' energy scales .",
    "it is important to realize that the kernel @xmath17 has a well defined classical limit .",
    "the classical approximation ( see remark @xcite ) is obtained by using microcanonical distributions instead of wigner functions .",
    "fixing @xmath18 , the vector @xmath17 describes the shape of the @xmath18-th eigenstate in the @xmath19 representation . by averaging over several eigenstates",
    "one obtains the average shape of the eigenstate ( asoe )",
    ". we can also identify @xmath17 as the local density of states ( ldos ) , by regarding it as a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath20 is considered to be a fixed reference state . in the latter case an average over few @xmath20-states",
    "is assumed .",
    "we shall denote the ldos by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the asoe is just @xmath23 .",
    "note that the asoe and the ldos are given by the same function .",
    "one would have to be more careful with these definitions if @xmath24 were integrable while @xmath25 non - integrable .",
    "a few words are in order regarding the definition of the ldos , and its importance in physical applications .",
    "the ldos , also known as strength function @xcite , describes an energy distribution .",
    "conventionally it is defined as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the retarded green function .",
    "we are interested in chaotic systems , so it should be clear that our @xmath21 is related by trivial change of variable ( @xmath28 ) to the above defined @xmath29 .",
    "our @xmath21 also incorporates an average over the reference state .",
    "the ldos is important in studies of either chaotic or complex conservative quantum systems that are encountered in nuclear physics as well as in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "related applications may be found in mesoscopic physics .",
    "going from @xmath24 to @xmath25 may signify a physical change of an external field , or switching on of a perturbation , or a sudden - change of an effective - interaction ( as in molecular dynamics @xcite ) .",
    "the so called ` line shape ' of the ldos is important for the understanding of the associated dynamics .",
    "it is also important to realize that the ldos is the fourier transform of the so - called ` survival probability amplitude ' @xcite ( see @xcite for concise presentation of this point ) .",
    "textbook @xcite formulations of perturbation theory can be applied in order to find the ldos .",
    "partial summations of diagrams to infinite order can be used in order to get an improved lorentzian - type approximation .",
    "however most textbooks do not illuminate the limitations and the subtleties which are involved in using the conventional perturbative schemes .",
    "it is therefore interesting to take a somewhat different approach to the study of ldos .",
    "the roots of this alternate approach can be traced back to the work of wigner @xcite regarding a simple banded random matrix ( brm ) model @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath31 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the ordered energies @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a banded matrix .",
    "the study of this model can be motivated by the realization that in generic circumstances it is possible to write @xmath34 .",
    "using a simple semiclassical argument @xcite it turns out that the matrix representation of any generic @xmath35 , in the eigen - basis that is determined by the chaotic hamiltonian @xmath24 , is a banded matrix .",
    "the important ingredient ( from our point of view ) in the original work by wigner , is the emphasis on the parametric - evolution ( pe ) of the ldos .",
    "the ldos describes an energy distribution : for @xmath36 the kernel @xmath21 is simply a kroneker delta function .",
    "as @xmath16 becomes larger , the width as well as the whole profile of this distribution ` evolves ' .",
    "wigner has realized that for his wbr model there are three parametric regimes . for very small",
    "@xmath16 we have the standard perturbative structure where most of the probability is concentrated in @xmath37 . for larger @xmath16",
    "we have a lorentzian line shape .",
    "but this lorentzian line shape does not persist if we further increase @xmath16 .",
    "instead we get a semi - circle line shape .",
    "many works about the ldos have followed @xcite , but the issue of pe has not been further discussed there .",
    "the emphasis in those works is mainly on the case where @xmath24 is an integrable or non - interacting system , while @xmath25 is possibly ( but not necessarily ) chaotic due to some added perturbation term .    the line of study which is pursued in the present work has been originated and motivated by studies of quantum dissipation @xcite .",
    "understanding pe can be regarded as a preliminary stage in the analysis of the energy spreading process in driven mesoscopic systems .",
    "note that the ldos gives the energy re - distribution due to a ` sudden ' ( very fast ) change of the hamiltonian .",
    "unlike the common approach for studies of ldos , we assume both @xmath25 and @xmath24 to be chaotic .",
    "both correspond to the same parametrically dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 , and there is nothing special in choosing a particular value @xmath38 as a starting point for the pe analysis .      the theory of pe , as discussed in general in @xcite and in particular in @xcite takes us beyond the random - matrix - theory considerations of wigner .",
    "there appear five ( rather than two ) different parametric scales ( see remark @xcite ) .",
    "these are summarized by table 1 .    .",
    "the parametric scales in the general theory of pe are listed ( left column ) along with the questions that motivate their introduction .",
    "the distribution @xmath21 may contain perturbative tail regions ( for @xmath39 ) , and non - perturbative core regions ( for @xmath40 ) .",
    "non - universal ( system specific ) features may manifest themselves in the core structure for @xmath41 . in generic examples",
    "@xmath42 allows classical approximation for @xmath21 .",
    "we are going to explain that only two independent parametric scales survive in the hard wall limit . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in the present paper we consider cavities with hard walls . we are going to explain that because of the ` hard wall limit ' there are only _ two _ independent parametric scales : one is @xmath43 and the others ( see remark @xcite ) coincide with @xmath44 . assuming that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are well separated , it follows that there are _ three _ distinct parametric regimes in the pe of our system .",
    "these are the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath45 ) , the core - tail regime ( @xmath46 ) , and the non - universal regime ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the exploration of the three parametric regimes in the pe of a deformed cavity with hard walls is the main issue of the present paper . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such detailed exploration has not been practical in the past .",
    "we owe our ability to carry out this task to a new powerful technique for finding clusters of billiard eigenstates @xcite .",
    "there are also some secondary issues that we are going to address :    * ( a ) * in the strict limit of hard walls the pe becomes non - unitarity .",
    "we shall use the 1d well example in order to shed light on this confusing issue .",
    "in particular we demonstrate that any truncation of the pe equation leads to false unitarity due to a finite - size edge effect .    *",
    "( b ) * for special deformations , namely those that constitute linear combination of translations rotations and dilations , the parametric scales @xmath43 and @xmath44 coincide . consequently there is no longer distinct core - tail regime , and the pe features a quite sharp transition from the standard perturbative regime to the non - universal regime .    *",
    "( c ) * in the non - universal regime we demonstrate that our numerical results are in accordance with our theoretical expectation @xcite .",
    "namely , the width of the ldos profile is determined by time - domain semiclassical considerations , rather then by phase - space or random - wave considerations .",
    "* ( d ) * the last section puts our specific study in a larger context .",
    "we explain why wigner s scenario of pe is not followed once hard walls are considered .",
    "we consider a particle moving inside @xmath47 dimensional cavity whose volume is @xmath48 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the particle is @xmath49 , where @xmath20 is its mass , and @xmath50 is its velocity .",
    "it is assumed that this motion is classically chaotic .",
    "the ballistic mean free path is @xmath51 .",
    "one can use the estimate @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total area of the walls .",
    "the associated time scale is @xmath54 .",
    "the penetration distance upon a collision is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the force that is exerted by the wall .",
    "upon quantization we have an additional length scale , which is the de - broglie wavelength @xmath57 .",
    "we shall distinguish between the _ hard walls _",
    "case where we assume @xmath58 , and _",
    "soft walls _ for which @xmath59 . note that taking @xmath60 implies soft walls .",
    "there is a class of special deformations that are shape - preserving .",
    "these are generated by translations , rotations and dilations of the cavity .",
    "a general deformation need not preserve the billiard shape nor its volume .",
    "we can specify any deformation by a function @xmath61 , where  @xmath62 specifies the location of a wall element on the boundary ( surface ) of the cavity , and @xmath63 is the normal displacement of this wall element .",
    "in many practical cases it is possible to use the convention @xmath64 . with this convention",
    "@xmath16 has units of length , and its value has the meaning of typical wall displacement .",
    "the eigen - energies of a particle inside the cavity are in general @xmath2-dependent , and can be written as @xmath65 .",
    "the mean level spacing is @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 . in our numerical study",
    "we shall consider a quarter stadium with curved edge of radius @xmath69 and straight edge of length @xmath69 .",
    "the ` volume ' of the quarter stadium is @xmath70 .",
    "the area of its boundary @xmath71 is just the perimeter .",
    "we shall look on the parametric evolution of eigenstates around @xmath72 where the mean level spacing in @xmath73 units is @xmath74 .",
    "consider the quantum - mechanical state @xmath75 .",
    "we can write @xmath76 .",
    "the parametric kernel can be written as @xmath77 .",
    "it is a standard exercise to obtain ( from @xmath78 and differentiating by parts ) the following equation for the amplitudes : @xmath79 in order to get @xmath17 one should solve this equation with the initial conditions @xmath80 .",
    "the transitions between levels are induced by the matrix elements @xmath81 and we use the ` gauge ' convention @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "( only one parameter is being changed and therefore berry s phase is not an issue ) .",
    "eq.([e3 ] ) is a possible starting point for constructing a perturbation theory for the pe of @xmath21 .",
    "see ref.@xcite for more details . as an input for this equation we need the matrix elements of @xmath84 .",
    "these can be calculated using a simple boundary integral formula @xcite whose simplest derivation @xcite is as follows : the position of the particle in the vicinity of a wall element is @xmath85 , where @xmath62 is a surface coordinate and @xmath86 is a perpendicular ` radial ' coordinate .",
    "we take @xmath87 so that @xmath88 the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction on the boundary is @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is a unit vector in the @xmath86 direction . for @xmath92",
    "the wavefunction @xmath93 is a decaying exponential .",
    "if @xmath94 is large enough , then the exponential decay is fast , and we can treat the boundary as if it were locally flat .",
    "it follows that the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction on the boundary should be equal to @xmath95 .",
    "consequently one obtains the following expression for the matrix elements : @xmath96 in the one - dimensional case the boundary integral is replace by the sum @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the two turning points of the potential well .",
    "the parametric evolution of @xmath21 for rotation and for generic deformation of the stadium is illustrated by the images of fig.4 and by the plots of figs.5 - 6 .",
    "the calculation of each @xmath21 profile is carried out as follows : given @xmath16 we use the method which is described in @xcite in order to calculate the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "then we plot the elements of @xmath17 versus @xmath182 . in order to obtain the average profile",
    "the plot is smeared using standard procedure ( see remark @xcite ) . the transformation from @xmath183 to @xmath22",
    "is done using the relation ( see remark @xcite ) : @xmath184 above @xmath185 is the mean level spacing of the @xmath186 spectrum , and @xmath187 is the volume change that is associated with the deformation ( it is approximately proportional to @xmath16 ) .",
    "if the deformation is volume preserving ( as in the case of rotation ) then the second term equals zero .",
    "but for the generic deformation that we have picked in our second numerical example , the volume is not preserved , and the systematic ` downwards ' shift of the levels should be taken into account .",
    "looking first in the case of rotation , we see clearly two parametric regimes : the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath188 ) , and the non - universal regime ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "let us clarify this observation .",
    "we see that for @xmath188 most of the probability is well concentrated in @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that we can use standard perturbation theory in order to estimate the @xmath190 probabilities . on the other hand for @xmath189 the perturbative nature of @xmath21",
    "is destroyed .",
    "now @xmath21 becomes smoother , and eventually ( for @xmath191 ) there is a very good fitting with lorentzian ( see lower plot in fig.5 ) .",
    "the qualitative explanation for the lorentzian profile is as follows : for @xmath191 the typical displacement of the walls is of the order of @xmath192 .",
    "therefore the @xmath3 eigenstates become uncorrelated with the @xmath193 eigenstates .",
    "consequently @xmath21 becomes @xmath16 independent .",
    "the lorentzian profile agrees with the assumption of uncorrelated random waves as explained in appendix a.    let us look now in the case of generic deformation .",
    "here we see clearly three parametric regimes : the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath194 ) , the core - tail regime ( @xmath195 ) , and the non - universal regime ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "let us clarify this observation .",
    "as in the case of rotation there is a standard perturbative regime ( @xmath194 ) where most of the probability is well concentrated in @xmath37 . for larger deformation , namely for @xmath196 , standard perturbation theory is no longer applicable because the @xmath197 level is mixed non perturbatively with other ( neighboring ) levels . as a result @xmath21 contains a non - perturbative ` core ' component",
    "however , for @xmath195 we definitely do not get a lorentzian .",
    "rather the tails of @xmath21 keep growing in the same way as in the standard perturbative regime .    in the case of the generic deformation , as in the case of rotation , we enter the non - universal regime , and eventually ( for @xmath198 ) we get a smooth lorentzian - like distribution",
    ". however , the lorentzian - like distribution is not identical with that of the rotation case .",
    "also the similarity to proper lorentzian is far from being satisfactory .",
    "( see lower plot in fig.6 ) .",
    "this means that the random - wave picture of appendix a is an oversimplification .    in the following sections we are going to summarize the theoretical considerations @xcite that explain the observed parametric scenario .",
    "in particular we are going to illuminate the way in which non - perturbative features emerge ; to clarify the crossover to the non - universal regime ; and to explain the specific nature of the non - universal distribution .",
    "for the purpose of the following argumentation it is convenient to take @xmath87 , but to keep @xmath94 large but finite .",
    "mathematically it is also convenient to think of the embedding space as having some huge but finite volume .",
    "we would like to illuminate a subtlety which is associated with the hard wall limit @xmath99 .",
    "for any finite @xmath94 the parametric kernel satisfies @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath3 is a complete orthonormal basis for any @xmath2 .",
    "however , for hard walls ( @xmath102 ) this statement is not true .",
    "this implies that for hard walls the pe in non - unitary .",
    "we are going to explain this point below .",
    "let us denote the volume of the original cavity by @xmath103 and of the deformed cavity by @xmath104 .",
    "the volume shared by the deformed and the undeformed cavities will be denoted by @xmath105 and we shall use the notation @xmath106 . for the purpose of the following argumentation",
    "let us consider a reference state @xmath20 whose energy @xmath107 is well below @xmath94 .",
    "let us also assume that the wall displacement is large compared to de - broglie wavelength .",
    "consequently the expression for @xmath17 has the following semiclassical structure : @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the above result can be deduced by assuming that the wavefunctions look ergodic in space , but still that they are characterized by a well - defined _ local _ wavelength .",
    "an equivalent derivation is obtained by using the phase - space picture of @xcite .",
    "both @xmath56 and @xmath110 in the above expression have unit normalization , and therefore @xmath101 for any finite @xmath94 .",
    "however , for hard walls ( @xmath102 ) we have @xmath111 and therefore @xmath112 .",
    "we may say the the operation of taking the hard wall limit does not commute with the summation in eq.([e7 ] ) .",
    "an analogous statement can be derived regarding the summation @xmath113 , with the respective definition @xmath114 .",
    "the correctness of the above observation becomes less trivial if we consider ( [ e3 ] ) with expressions ( [ e4 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) substituted for the matrix elements . looking on ( [ e4 ] ) with ( [ e6 ] ) it looks as if the matrix @xmath115 is hermitian , and therefore should generate unitary pe .",
    "but this statement is mathematically correct only for ( any ) finite truncation @xmath116 of the pe equation .",
    "for @xmath117 the matrix @xmath115 becomes non - hermitian .",
    "it turns out that for any finite @xmath116 , there is a pile - up of probability in the edges of the spreading profile , due to finite - size effect .",
    "we shall demonstrate this effect in the next section using a simple 1d example .",
    "in other words , if we solve eq.([e3 ] ) for hard - walled cavity , we get as a result eq.([e_7 ] ) with @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath117 we get @xmath111 and therefore @xmath112 in accordance with the conclusion of the previous paragraph .    thus if either @xmath119 or @xmath120 then we have unitary pe .",
    "but for hard walls , meaning @xmath102 with @xmath117 , we have non - unitary pe .",
    "the lost probability is associated with the second term in eq.([e_7 ] ) .",
    "this term is peaked around a high energy @xmath121 .",
    "for hard walls @xmath111 and consequently some probability is lost .",
    "the above picture is supported by the simple pedagogical example of the next section .",
    "consider a 1d box with hard walls , where the free motion of the particle is within @xmath122 .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the wavenumber , and @xmath125 is the level index .",
    "the phase factor @xmath126 has been introduced for convenience .",
    "we consider now the parametric evolution as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "one easily obtains @xmath128 where @xmath129 is assumed to be smaller than @xmath69 , corresponding to expansion of the box .",
    "the probability kernel is @xmath130 .",
    "one can verify that the parametric evolution in the @xmath131 direction is unitary , meaning that @xmath132 . on the other hand in the @xmath133 direction",
    "the parametric evolution is non - unitary , because @xmath134 .",
    "the profile of @xmath17 for fixed @xmath18 is illustrated by a dashed line in fig.2 .",
    "we can restore unitarity by making @xmath94 large but finite .",
    "in such case , a variation of the above calculation leads to the following picture : consider the overlap of a reference level @xmath135 with the levels @xmath136 . as in the case @xmath102 there is a probability @xmath137 which is located in the levels whose energies are @xmath138 .",
    "but now the `` lost '' probability @xmath139 is located in the levels whose energies are @xmath140 .",
    "thus we have @xmath141 rather than @xmath134 .",
    "we consider again the case @xmath102 .",
    "the normal derivative on the boundary is @xmath142 .",
    "hence we can easily get the following result @xmath143 it is more convenient to use @xmath144 for parameterization .",
    "hence the equation that describes the parametric evolution is @xmath145 for any finite truncation @xmath120 this equation manifestly generates unitary parametric evolution .",
    "it is only for @xmath117 that it becomes equivalent to the non - unitary evolution of the 1d box .",
    "again , one can wonder where the ` lost ' probability is located if @xmath120 .",
    "the answer is illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "we see that the ` lost ' probability piles up at the edge of the ( truncated ) tail .",
    "it is possible to use semiclassical considerations @xcite in order to determine the band profile of the matrix eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "the application to the cavity example has been introduced in @xcite , and numerically demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this semiclassical estimate is remarkable . here",
    "we summarize the recipe .",
    "first one should generate a very long ( ergodic ) trajectory , and define for it the fluctuating quantity @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the time of a collision , @xmath148 stands for @xmath61 at the point of the collision , and @xmath149 is the normal component of the particle s velocity . each delta spike ( for soft walls",
    "it is actually a narrow rectangular spike ) corresponds to one collision .",
    "now one can calculate the correlation function @xmath150 of the fluctuating quantity @xmath151 , and its fourier transform @xmath152 .",
    "the semiclassical estimate for the band profile is @xmath153    ref.@xcite contains a systematic study of the function @xmath152 . for large @xmath154 ,",
    "meaning @xmath155 , one can use @xmath156 ^ 2 d{{\\mathbf s}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the geometric factor is @xmath157 for @xmath158 . a lengthy calculation",
    "@xcite reveals that eq.([e13 ] ) with ( [ e14 ] ) substituted , is an exact global result if we could assume that the cavity eigenfunctions look like ` random waves ' , and that different wavefunctions are uncorrelated .",
    "however , it turns out that to take this ` random wave ' result as a global approximation is an over - simplification . for @xmath159 , using the semiclassical recipe and assuming strongly chaotic cavity , one obtains @xmath160 with @xmath161 for dilations and translations , @xmath162 for rotations , and @xmath163 for normal deformations .",
    "we use the term special deformations @xcite in order to distinguish those deformations that has the property @xmath164 in the limit @xmath165 .",
    "any combination of dilations , translations and rotations is a special deformation . around the bouncing frequency ( @xmath166 )",
    "the function @xmath152 typically displays some non - universal ( system and deformation specific ) structure .",
    "this is true for any typical deformation , but for some deformations the non - universal features are more pronounced . if the cavity has bouncing ball modes , we may get also a modified ( non - universal ) behavior in the small frequency limit . for the purpose of general discussion it is convenient to assume that the interpolation between ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) is smooth , but in actual numerical calculation the actual @xmath152 is computed ( see below ) .    as a numerical example",
    "we have picked the stadium billiard .",
    "we have found the eigenstates of a de - symmetrized ( quarter ) stadium as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have selected those eigenstates whose eigen - energies @xmath167 are in the vicinity of @xmath168 .",
    "our two representative deformations are : * ( a ) * rotation around the stadium center ; and * ( b ) * generic ( non - special ) deformation involving the curved edge . in the latter case",
    "the curved edge of the quarter stadium ( @xmath169 ) is pushed outwards with @xmath170 , while for the straight edges @xmath171 .",
    "( the corner @xmath172 is the @xmath173 intersection of the curved edge with the long straight edge ) .",
    "the respective band profiles are displayed in fig.3 .",
    "the band profile has been defined as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the distance from the diagonal .",
    "note that @xmath176 is just a scaled version of the semiclassical @xmath152 as implied by eq.([e13 ] ) with ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "the remarkable agreement of @xmath176 with the semiclassical calculation has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that in the hard wall limit ( which is assumed here ) the matrix @xmath177 is not a banded matrix . it would become banded if we were assuming _ soft _ walls . for soft walls",
    "@xmath152 becomes vanishingly small for @xmath178 .",
    "the bandwidth in energy units is @xmath179 , and in dimensionless units it is @xmath180 unless stated otherwise we have @xmath181 .",
    "standard perturbation theory gives the following first order expression for the ldos @xmath199 this expression is most straightforwardly obtained by inspecting eqs.([e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "we can define the ( total ) transition probability as @xmath200 using eq.([e19 ] ) combined with ( [ e13 ] ) we get the following estimate : @xmath201 standard perturbation theory is applicable as long as @xmath202 .",
    "this can be converted into an equivalent inequality @xmath45 . by this definition @xmath43",
    "is the parametric deformation which is needed in order to mix the initial level @xmath20 with other levels @xmath203 .",

    "it is illuminating to use the convention @xmath212 , such that @xmath16 measures the typical displacement of a wall element . with this convention",
    "we get from eqs.([e22])-([e23 ] ) the following : @xmath213 in the generic case the effective area of the deformed boundary @xmath214 may be smaller than the total area @xmath215 of the boundary . the effective area @xmath214 can be formally defined by comparing eq.([e24 ] ) with eq.([e23 ] ) .",
    "eq.([e24_d ] ) has been added for sake of completeness of our presentation .",
    "it correspond to the diffractive limit @xmath216 .",
    "note that this limit is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "thus in the generic case , the wall displacement needed to mix levels is much smaller than @xmath192 . in the generic case @xmath217 rather than",
    "@xmath206 . what happens with perturbation theory beyond @xmath43 ?",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "for @xmath40 standard perturbation theory diverges due to the non - perturbative mixing of neighboring levels on small scale : once @xmath16 becomes of the order of @xmath43 several levels are mixed , and as @xmath16 becomes larger , more levels are being mixed non - perturbatively .",
    "consequently it is natural to distinguish between _ core _ and _ tail _ regions @xcite .",
    "most of the spreading probability is contained within the core region , which implies a natural extension of first - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) : the first step is to transform eq.([e3 ] ) into a new basis where transitions within the core are eliminated ; the second step is to use fopt ( in the new basis ) in order to analyze the core - to - tail transitions .",
    "details of this procedure , which is in the spirit of degenerate perturbation theory , were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the most important ( and non - trivial ) consequence of this procedure is the observation that mixing on small scales does not affect the transitions on large - scales .",
    "therefore we have in the tail region @xmath218 rather than @xmath219 .",
    "the validity of this observation has been numerically illustrated in @xcite .    following the above reasoning",
    "we define the _ tail _ region as consists of those levels whose ` occupation ' can be calculated using perturbation theory , while the _ core _ is the non - perturbative component in the vicinity of @xmath37 .",
    "assuming that only one scale characterize the core width , one arrives at the following practical approximation : @xmath220 it is implicit in this definition that @xmath221 should be regarded as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath222 is determined ( for a given @xmath16 ) such that @xmath223 has a unit normalization .",
    "one may say that @xmath222 regularizes the behavior around @xmath37 . for generic deformation",
    "we get @xmath224 the core is defined as the region @xmath225 , and the outer ( @xmath226 ) regions are the tails . for @xmath45",
    "we get @xmath227 and the core - tail structure eq.([e25 ] ) becomes equivalent to the standard perturbative result eq.([e19 ] ) .",
    "it should be clear that the core - tail structure is a generalization of wigner s lorentzian .",
    "it is indeed a lorentzian in the special case of a ` flat ' band profile .",
    "we turn now to analyze our numerical results .",
    "we have verified ( see eg fig.7 ) that for @xmath228 we have good agreement with perturbation theory irrespective of whether we have a core component ( which is the case for the generic deformation ) or not ( which is the case for the rotation ) .",
    "as we come closer to @xmath229 the agreement becomes worse , and for @xmath230 we have a total collapse of perturbation theory . in fig.8",
    "we display the total transition probability @xmath231 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "this plot should be used in order to numerically determine the value of @xmath43 , say as the value where @xmath232 .",
    "fig.8 also displays comparison with the corresponding perturbative calculation ( using eq.([e20 ] ) with([e25 ] ) ) . the agreement ( for @xmath233 ) in case of the rotation is remarkable . for larger values of @xmath16",
    "one observes a linear drop of the total probability due to the non - unitary nature of the evolution .",
    "( this drop is clearly linear in a linear - linear scale which is not displayed ) .",
    "the eventual rise of the total transition probability ( beyond @xmath69 ) in case of the generic deformation , reflects numerical errors in the determination of the small @xmath183 overlaps .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "the lower subfigure in fig.8 displays the calculated core width @xmath234 for the generic deformation . recall that @xmath234 is determined , given @xmath16 , such that @xmath223 of eq.([e25 ] ) is normalized .",
    "also calculated is the width @xmath235 of the region that contains @xmath236 of the probability . the width @xmath235 is calculated for both @xmath223 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath237 in the standard perturbative regime .",
    "the determination of @xmath43 for the generic deformation becomes more convenient by using this plot .",
    "also the crossover ( at @xmath238 ) to the non - universal regime is most pronounced .",
    "the validity of eq.([e25 ] ) as a global approximation relies on the assumption that the core is characterized only by one scale ( which is @xmath234 ) . but this assumption ceases to be true if @xmath16 is large enough .",
    "we have explained in ref.@xcite that the width of the _ core _ defines a ` window ' through which we can view the ` landscape ' of the semiclassical analysis .",
    "as @xmath16 becomes larger , this ` window ' becomes wider , and eventually some of semiclassical structure is exposed .",
    "this is marked by the non - universal parametric scale @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath16 larger than @xmath44 , the non - universal structure of the core is exposed .",
    "what is the semiclassical structure of the ldos ?",
    "time - domain semiclassical considerations ( see eq.(10 ) of @xcite and related discussion there ) imply that the non - universal structure of the core is @xmath239 with @xmath240 .",
    "the definition of the collision rate @xmath241 is similar to that of @xmath242 .",
    "the former is the collision rate with the deformed area @xmath243 , and therefore it may be smaller than @xmath242 , because @xmath244 is related to the total area @xmath215 .",
    "if , by mistake , we identified @xmath245 with @xmath244 , then we would get the random wave result which is derived in appendix a. this would be an over simplification .",
    "if it were true , it would imply that for @xmath246 we should have got the same lorentzian - distribution in both cases ( the rotation and the generic deformation ) . what we see",
    ", as a matter of fact , is that for the rotation ( fig.5 ) we have a reasonably good agreement with lorentzian whose width is @xmath247 , whereas for the generic deformation ( fig.6 ) there is rough agreement with lorentzian whose width is @xmath248 .",
    "the smaller width in the latter case clearly reflects having larger @xmath245 .",
    "for the generic deformation we also have pronounced non - lorentzian features .",
    "actually the global fitting to lorentzian is quite bad .",
    "our understanding is that these features are due to the bouncing - ball trapping : it leads to non - exponential decay of the time - dependent survival probability ( see @xcite for definition of the latter term ) , and hence to the observed non lorentzian features of the spreading profile .",
    "we turn now to explain how @xmath44 is determined . by definition",
    "it is the deformation which is required in order to expose features of the semiclassical landscape .",
    "these features start to be exposed once @xmath249 which should be converted into an equivalent expression @xmath250 .",
    "thus we get @xmath251 here @xmath243 is the geometric area of the deformation ( in the sense of scattering cross - section ) , while @xmath214 is the effective area of the deformation .",
    "the definition of the latter is implied by comparing eq.([e24 ] ) with eq.([e23 ] ) . by rescaling @xmath252 and @xmath253",
    ", we can make @xmath254 by convention .",
    "for special deformations @xmath44 coincides with @xmath43 implying that we get into the non - universal regime as soon as we have a breakdown of standard perturbation theory .",
    "our theoretical consideration so far do not imply a total collapse of perturbation theory .",
    "we may have in principle a co - existence of non - universal core component and perturbative tails .",
    "actually we see such co - existence in the lower subfigures of fig.7 , mainly for @xmath255 .",
    "the right peak around @xmath256 is clearly non - perturbative , while the rest of the profile is in reasonable ( though not very good ) agreement with the perturbative calculation .",
    "we are going to explain in the next section that the total collapse of perturbation theory for @xmath230 is actually not related at all to the appearance of non - universal features in the core structure .",
    "it is only circumstantial that in the hard wall limit this collapse happens as soon as we enter the non - universal regime .",
    "a good starting for the following discussion is to consider the classical approximation for @xmath21 .",
    "namely , in eq.([e1 ] ) one approximates @xmath12 and @xmath11 by microcanonical distributions .",
    "a phase - space illustration of the energy surfaces which support @xmath12 and @xmath11 can be found in fig.1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the classical @xmath17 equals to the overlap of these surfaces .",
    "if we were dealing with a generic system we could introduce a linearized version of the hamiltonian @xmath257 , where @xmath258 . by definition",
    "this linearization is a good approximation provided @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the classical correlation scale of @xmath261 with respect to @xmath2 . in the classical linear regime",
    "the classical @xmath21 has the scaling property @xmath262 .",
    "an equivalent definition of @xmath260 in the quantum - mechanical case is obtained by looking on the @xmath2 dependence of the matrix elements of @xmath261 in some _ fixed  basis_.",
    "again we define @xmath260 as the respective correlation scale .",
    "it is quite clear that for cavity with soft walls we have @xmath263 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 has been defined as the penetration distance upon collision . from purely classical point of view the hard wall limit",
    "@xmath264 is a _ non - linear _ limit .",
    "but this is not true quantum - mechanically .",
    "here we have @xmath265 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath266 .",
    "the terminology ` classical correlation scale ' while referring to @xmath260 becomes misleading here , but we shall keep using it anyway .    the theory of the core - tail structure @xcite is valid only in the linear regime @xmath259 .",
    "let us assume for a moment soft walls .",
    "we can ask : is @xmath259 a sufficient condition for having a core - tail structure ?",
    "the answer is definitely not .",
    "perturbation theory has a final collapse once the core width @xmath267 becomes of the order of the band width @xmath268 .",
    "this defines a parametric scale @xmath269 . for @xmath270",
    "the ldos becomes purely non - perturbative . in wigner",
    "s theory of random banded matrices this corresponds to the crossover from lorentzian to semicircle line shape .",
    "however , in the limit of hard walls the above mechanism of collapse becomes irrelevant because the band width is infinite ( @xmath181 ) . on the other hand we still have to satisfy the inequality @xmath259 .",
    "thus , for @xmath271 we expect a total collapse of perturbation theory , as indeed observed in the numerical study .",
    "it is possible to estimate the overlap @xmath272 if we assume that @xmath273 and @xmath274 are _ uncorrelated _ random - superpositions of plane - waves : a random - superpositions of plane - waves is characterized by the correlation function @xmath275 where @xmath276 is a generalized bessel function ( for further details see appendix d of @xcite ) . assuming that the wavefunction of @xmath273 is uncorrelated with the wavefunction of @xmath274 one obtains @xmath277 the integration is over the whole volume of the cavity . using the definition of the @xmath278 function we can cast this expression into the form @xmath279 where the average is over the difference @xmath280 , with all possible orientations for @xmath281 and for @xmath282 .",
    "the function @xmath283 is defined as follows : @xmath284 the function @xmath283 depends mainly on @xmath285 .",
    "we can obtain an estimate for @xmath286 by considering a spherical cavity @xmath287 with the same volume . using spherical coordinates",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the following : @xmath288\\right)^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above @xmath289 is a fourier transform from @xmath2 to @xmath290 .",
    "for @xmath291 we have simply @xmath292 .",
    "for @xmath293 we have @xmath294 .",
    "this is because of the singularity at @xmath295 .",
    "the average over @xmath290 can be done using again spherical coordinate .",
    "we have @xmath296 , where @xmath297 , and we can transform the @xmath298 integration into @xmath299 integration : @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the solid angle in @xmath47 dimensions .",
    "there is no point in trying to carry an exact integration .",
    "rather , it is important to observe that a practical approximation for the overlap is : @xmath302 in the latter expression we have neglected the @xmath47-dependent normalization prefactor .",
    "it is a ` practical ' approximation since it gives the correct behavior for both small and large values of @xmath303 .",
    "the interpolation around @xmath304 can not be trusted .            the classical approximation for @xmath17 works well for ergodic eigenstates .",
    "as explained later in the text we actually consider the averaged profile .",
    "namely , @xmath17 is regarded as a function of @xmath305 , and it is averaged over the reference state @xmath20 . with this procedure",
    "the effect of the minority of non - ergodic eigenstates can be neglected in the classical limit .",
    "the two parametric scales of wigner s rmt model correspond to @xmath43 and @xmath269 of table 1 .",
    "consequently there are three parametric regimes in wigner s theory .",
    "these are the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath45 ) , the lorentzian regime ( @xmath306 ) , and the semi - circle regime ( @xmath307 ) . as an artifact of this rmt model",
    ", there actually exists a forth regime ( anderson strong localization regime ) that in the present context does not have a semiclassical analog .",
    "as explained in @xcite the generic hierarchy is @xmath308 .",
    "this hierarchy is realized in the classical limit ( small @xmath309 ) where we have soft walls ( see section ii ) .",
    "the hard wall limit is non - generic , and these four parametric scales coincide . in the present paper",
