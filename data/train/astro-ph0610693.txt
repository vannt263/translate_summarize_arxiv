    "it is uncertain whether these irregular morphologies are due to patchy star formation , prevalent merger activity , or some other physical process and consequently unknown whether these morphologies can ( analogously to local galaxies ) tell us anything about the star formation rate , mass , or stellar kinematics of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "since morphological studies are often performed at optical wavelengths which probe rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation for galaxies at redshifts @xmath3 , one might _",
    "expect _ that the morphologies of such galaxies should appear irregular since radiation at such wavelengths predominantly traces emission from the brightest active star forming regions rather than the redder bulk of the stellar population ( dickinson 2000 ) .",

    "one popular explanation for these multi - component , irregular morphologies is that they represent major merger systems , and that their prevalence indicates that the rate of major mergers was much greater at high redshifts than in the local universe ( e.g. conselice et al .",

    "the `` @xmath28 '' system of parameters has recently been a popular choice , characterizing galaxies on the basis of their concentration ( @xmath29 ; kent 1985 , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath30 , schade et al . 1995 ) , and clumpiness ( @xmath31 , conselice et al . 2003 )",
    ". however , the first two of these quantities are explicitly defined with regard to circular or elliptical apertures measured about a central point , which is only well defined for galaxies with morphologies similar to traditional elliptical or spiral galaxies , while the third quantity relies upon suitable choice of a smoothing scale on which clumpiness is defined . in the case of the @xmath0 galaxy sample ,",
    "morphologies are generally so irregular ( see fig .",
    "[ mosaica.fig ] ) that they do not have a well - defined `` center '' , and the measured values of the @xmath28 parameters can depend strongly upon the particular choice of center is strictly found by numerically searching through the image for the choice of center which minimizes the value of @xmath30 ( see discussion by conselice , bershady , & jangren 2000 ) .",
    "while this relaxation technique partially mitigates bias arising from poor centering , it does not address the underlying bias present in the assumption of circular symmetry for galaxies as irregular as those depicted in figure [ mosaica.fig ] . ] and smoothing length ( see lotz , primack , & madau 2004 , hereafter lpm04 , for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we therefore favor a non - parametric approach to classification similar to that discussed by abraham et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , lpm04 , and lotz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who define the gini coefficient @xmath32 as a measure of the uniformity of the flux distribution within a source . in the following sections",
    ", we describe this and three additional non - parametric coefficients which we find effectively characterize the irregular morphologies of these @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we note that although we considered a host of additional parameters in our analyses ( including the petrosian radius and a non - parametric `` petrosian area '' ) , we found that they provided no additional information and therefore omit them from further discussion .",
    "it is of critical importance when measuring the morphologies of faint and highly irregular galaxies to apply uniform selection criteria by which to assign pixels to a galaxy as opposed to the surrounding sky ( i.e. defining the `` segmentation map '' of the source ) .",
    "a variety of criteria have been adopted in previous studies , ranging from complex methods based upon curve - of - growth analysis ( e.g. lpm04 ) to basic surface brightness selection ( e.g. abraham et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the first of these methods , while robust to cosmological surface brightness dimming , can be non - trivial to implement in a manner consistent with non - parametric analysis . as outlined by lpm04 , the curve - of - growth method calculates the elliptical petrosian radius of a source ( i.e. the radius from the center of the source at which the average flux falls to a fixed fraction of the total inscribed flux ; petrosian 1976 ) , and assigns to the segmentation map all pixels within a suitably large radius of this center whose fluxes are greater than the value at the petrosian radius .",
    "unfortunately , such a segmentation map enforces elliptical petrosian radii about a particular center and introduces biases similar to that of the @xmath28 system into the resulting morphological coefficients .",
    "while such a segmentation map is useful for sources with approximately elliptical isophotes , we find that it tends to fail for galaxies with multiple components or extremely irregular shapes since pixels at a particular `` petrosian '' radius from an artificial center tend to include a large number of sky pixels , decreasing the threshhold for surface brightness selection and resulting in some fraction of sky pixels being allocated to the galaxy in the final segmentation map .",
    "while the most noticeable cases may be fixed by hand , this nonetheless introduces a bias as a function of morphological irregularity .",
    "we explore the effect of this bias on the measured gini coefficient in further detail in  3.3 .    in contrast",
    ", the second of these methods ( basic surface brightness selection ) takes no account of surface brightness dimming but is more amenable to non - parametric analysis .",
    "however , with the aid of our confirmed spectroscopic redshifts for each galaxy in the optically - selected sample , we adapt this morphology - independent surface brightness selection technique to utilize a variable threshhold tuned to select pixels in an identical range of intrinsic surface brightnesses at each redshift .",
    "our segmentation map is calculated as follows : for each galaxy , we use our initial estimates of the position ( based on seeing - limited @xmath33 imaging ) to calculate the first order moment of the _ hst_-acs uv flux distribution within a 1.5 arcsecond ( 30 pixel ) radius .",
    "a revised value for the center is calculated using this first order moment , and all pixels within a 1.5 arcsecond radius ( i.e. slightly larger than the size of the largest galaxy in our sample , so the exact position of the `` center '' is unimportant ) of this new center are considered as possible candidates for assignment to the segmentation map . while the acs data product images have already been sky subtracted , we find that this subtraction is sometimes imperfect and therefore subtract off residual sky flux measured in an annulus of radius 1.5 - 2 arcseconds around the revised center ( using a @xmath34 rejection algorithm to eliminate possible contaminating flux from sources which are nearby in projection ) . generally , these residual sky fluxes were small compared to the calculated object flux .",
    "once this pre - processing is complete , we assign to the segmentation map all pixels whose flux is at least @xmath35 , where @xmath24 is the standard deviation of pixel values in the sky annulus , and where @xmath36 varies with redshift as @xmath37 this variable surface brightness selection compensates for the effects of cosmological dimming throughout our range of sample redshifts since ( for a fixed observed bandpass ) surface brightness scales as @xmath38 and our selection criteria therefore include pixels of the same intrinsic surface brightness at all redshifts ( we make the assumption that there is no intrinsic evolution of surface brightness with redshift , although see discussion in  3.2 ) .",
    "we set @xmath39 ( i.e. the upper end of our redshift distribution ) , so the value of the selection threshhold varies by a factor of about four across our redshift interval from @xmath34 at redshift @xmath40 to @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "we neglect the change in angular size with redshift since the angular diameter distance changes by only @xmath43 % over @xmath44 for our assumed cosmology .",
    "the physical interpretation of our adopted segmentation map is illustrated in figure [ sigmacuts.fig ] , which shows the pixels selected for a typical source according to 3 , 5 , and 10@xmath24 criteria .",
    "we note that by considering only flux within a 1.5 arcsecond radius we effectively restrict our sensitivity to morphology on distance scales @xmath45 kpc at the redshift of our sample , similar to previous analyses ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a , lpm04 , lotz et al .",
    "2006 ) whose selection radii range up to about 10 kpc . based on visual analysis of acs and ground - based color maps , this appears to be the optimal choice of distance scale to include the majority of likely components for a particular galaxy whilst almost entirely excluding probable contaminants which appear nearby in projection . while it is likely that some gravitationally interacting systems extend considerably beyond 13 kpc , we neglect these distant components in our characterization of the system morphology since 1 ) our photometric and spectroscopic data is sensitive only to light at radii @xmath46 1.5 arcseconds , and 2 ) close interactions are more likely than distant to produce observable changes in the physical state of a galaxy .      the simplest morphological parameter to define is the projected physical size of the source ( @xmath22 ) seen above our surface brightness threshhold ( we use @xmath22 instead of the more intuitive @xmath31 to avoid confusion with the `` clumpiness '' parameter of conselice et al .",
    "since the radius of a galaxy is not meaningful for multi - component systems , we use our spectroscopic redshifts to define @xmath22 as the total projected galaxy area in square physical kpc .",
    "that is , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total number of 50 mas @xmath49 50 mas pixels in the segmentation map , and @xmath50 is the angular diameter distance ( in kiloparsecs ) to redshift @xmath23 for the assumed cosmology .",
    "this parameter makes no attempt to discriminate between sources on the basis of the total amount or relative distribution of flux within the segmentation map , and may therefore classify similarly both small strongly nucleated sources ( which have a low number of high flux pixels ) and large yet extremely faint and nebulous sources ( which have a low number of low flux pixels barely satisfying the surface brightness selection criteria ) .    in figure [ z.gmn.fig ] we plot the distribution of @xmath22 for the @xmath14 and @xmath17 samples ( upper left panel , black and red histograms respectively ) .",
    "@xmath22 typically ranges in value from less than 5 kpc@xmath51 for faint and nebulous sources to around 10 kpc@xmath51 for the most strongly nucleated single sources , and up to as much as 48 kpc@xmath51 for the brightest extended sources . in the @xmath14 and @xmath17 samples",
    "the mean projected size is @xmath52 kpc@xmath51 and @xmath53 kpc@xmath51 respectively .",
    "this small ( @xmath54 ) apparent increase in average size from @xmath14 to @xmath17 arises because the @xmath17 sample does not extend as far down the luminosity function as the @xmath14 and small faint sources are therefore underrepresented in the @xmath17 sample . if we compare only the fraction of the @xmath14 sample that overlaps the @xmath17 in rest - frame uv luminosity ( @xmath55 ; reddy et al .",

    "the average value of @xmath22 at @xmath14 rises to @xmath57 kpc@xmath51 , which is within @xmath58 of the @xmath17 result .",
    "indeed , we note that in a recent analysis designed to more precisely measure the size evolution of galaxies ( as determined from their sextractor half - light radii ) ferguson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the angular size of single - component galaxies decreases with increasing redshift above @xmath59 .",
    "the gini coefficient ( @xmath32 , originally attributed to corrado gini [ 1912 ] and first introduced into the astronomical literature by abraham et al .",
    "2003 ) measures the cumulative distribution function of a population and may be used to distinguish between the cases for which flux is strongly nucleated versus uniformly nebulous ( see lpm04 for a detailed introduction ) .",
    "mathematically , @xmath32 may be calculated as ( glasser 1962 ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average flux and the @xmath62 pixel fluxes are sorted in increasing order before the summation over all @xmath48 pixels in the segmentation map .",
    "the normalization prefactor multiplying the summation ensures that @xmath32 takes values from zero to one inclusive , where low values indicate a uniform flux distribution and high values a concentration of flux in a few pixels .    practically , we find that @xmath32 differentiates clearly between galaxy morphologies based on the degree of nucleation of their uv emission- sources which appear very nebulous generally have @xmath63 , while sources with strongly nucleated emission have @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ mosaica.fig ] ) .",
    "the wide range of galaxies with some combination of nucleated and nebulous emission components fall in a continuous distribution between these values .",
    "we note that this range of values ( @xmath65 ) is substantially different from that calculated for @xmath66 hdf - n lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) by lotz et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) , who found @xmath67 . while some discrepancy is to be expected with the lpm04 results since these authors used rest - optical data from hst - nicmos ( although this difference should be minimal in light of the similarity between rest - uv and rest - optical morphologies ) , we should expect greater similarity to the findings of lotz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who used hst - acs rest - uv data similar to our own .",
    "this difference in results appears to arise primarily from the adopted pixel selection method ; we find that elliptical petrosian selection methods similar to that of lpm04 tend to include more sky pixels at the `` petrosian '' radius for highly irregular and nebulous objects ( i.e. low @xmath32 in our sample ) , which lowers the threshhold for assignment to the galaxy and includes more sky pixels in the resulting segmentation map . including extra sky pixels in the map",
    "makes the genuine galaxy pixels appear to be comparatively more rich in flux , artificially increasing the value of @xmath32 calculated for the sources . applying a segmentation map similar to that of lpm04",
    ", we find that the gini coefficient calculated for our highest @xmath32 sources remains relatively unchanged , while our low gini sources increase their values of @xmath32 considerably , artificially compressing the range of values to @xmath68 , closely mimicking the range of values presented by lpm04 .",
    "we conclude that while the lpm04 values are accurate in the sense that a @xmath69 ( in their calculation ) galaxy is more nebulous than a @xmath70 , the noise introduced by this compression in dynamic range severely hampers the discriminating power of the gini coefficient .",
    "a histogram of values of @xmath32 is plotted in figure [ z.gmn.fig ] , and suggests that the mean value of the gini coefficient appears to change from @xmath71 at @xmath14 to @xmath72 at @xmath17 . to some extent",
    "this may be due to the underrepresentation of faint , nebulous objects in the @xmath17 sample ( see  3.2 ) , but even restricting the sample to the same range in intrinsic uv luminosity the difference between the two samples is of order @xmath34 suggesting that the uv emission from objects at @xmath17 is genuinely slightly more nucleated than at @xmath14 , consistant with the finding of ferguson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who demonstrated that apparent galaxy size at constant luminosity decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "we note that to first order , @xmath32 does not distinguish between sources based upon their number of nucleated components- i.e. a galaxy with two or more apparent nucleations has a value of @xmath32 nearly identical to a galaxy with only one , so long as the cumulative distribution of light is similar .",
    "that is , the exact _ spatial _ distribution of flux is irrelevant to @xmath32 , which is instead sensitive to the overall _ curve of growth _ of the total flux .",
    "our third classification parameter ( @xmath73 ) is designed to discriminate between sources based on how many apparent components the light distribution is broken into , i.e. how `` multiple '' the source appears .",
    "this parameter is similar to both the asymmetry parameter @xmath30 ( schade et al .",
    "1995 ) and the second order moment of the 20% brightest pixels ( @xmath74 , lpm04 ) in that it is sensitive to the presence and distribution of multiple clumps of flux .",
    "however , both @xmath30 and @xmath74 have their limitations : @xmath30 depends strongly on the assumption of overall circular symmetry about some central point for each galaxy , while @xmath74 is normalized by the moment of the segmentation map to remove the effect of overall galaxy size , which unfortunately results in a limited dynamic range since the segmentation map and the 20% brightest pixels often have a similar spatial distribution .",
    "in contrast , @xmath73 is defined in a manner that requires neither a center of symmetry nor a conventional normalization .    using the observed flux distribution as a proxy for `` mass '' , we calculate the `` potential energy '' of the light distribution projected into our line of sight as @xmath75 where the summation of the pixel fluxes @xmath62 and @xmath76 runs over all @xmath48 pixels in the segmentation map , and @xmath77 is the distance ( in pixels ) between pixels @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this value is normalized by that which would be achieved with the most compact possible re - arrangement of the flux pixels , i.e. the configuration which would require the most `` work '' to pull apart .",
    "we re - arrange the physical positions of the @xmath48 pixels of the segmentation map in a circular configuration with the brightest pixel in the center and with pixel flux decreasing outwards with radius . calling the distance between pixels @xmath78 and @xmath79 in this re - arranged map @xmath80 , the projected potential energy of this compact light distribution is @xmath81    the multiplicity coefficient is then defined logarithmically as the ratio of these two quantities : @xmath82    as shown in figure [ z.gmn.fig ] , @xmath73 ranges from 0 up to about 30 .",
    "typically , @xmath83 for single well - nucleated sources , @xmath84 for sources which are beginning to show a second component in addition to the main nucleation , and @xmath85 for strong double - nucleation systems . at values of @xmath86 , @xmath73 increases",
    "as the number and separation distance of nucleations increase , but numerical distinctions become less obvious until at @xmath87 the majority of sources are low @xmath32 nebulous sources for which @xmath73 breaks down as a useful statistic ( see  3.6 ) .",
    "there is therefore some degree of correlation between @xmath73 and the gini coefficient @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ giniwork.fig ] ) since sources with very nebulous emission ( i.e. small @xmath32 ) tend to have very spread out flux distributions ( i.e. large @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , this is of secondary importance to the largely orthogonal classification permitted by these two parameters ; while @xmath32 is most sensitive to the overall curve of growth of the flux distribution and fairly insensitive to the number of nucleated components , @xmath73 is sensitive to the number of bright components and comparatively insensitive to the overall curve of growth .",
    "we note that since @xmath73 is a flux - weighted statistic it is more sensitive to bright pixels , and therefore a bright central source with an extremely faint secondary source will tend to have low @xmath73 , while the same central source with a bright secondary source will tend to have higher @xmath73 .      finally , we capitalize on the available multi - wavelength _ hst_-acs data by defining the color dispersion parameter @xmath88 ( papovich et al .",
    "2003 ) , which quantifies the degree of morphological difference between two bandpasses .",

    "further details regarding the definition of this statistic are given by papovich et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ z.gmn.fig ] , typical values range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , with @xmath96 at @xmath14 and @xmath97 at @xmath17 ( i.e. consistent with a constant value to well within the uncertainty ) .",
    "we note that this range of values is larger than that of @xmath98 found by papovich et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a sample of @xmath99 galaxies measured between rest - uv and optical bandpasses .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is uncertain , although it is likely that different galaxy samples , segmentation maps , and bandpasses all contribute . by and",
    "large , it appears that our calculated @xmath88 is dominated mainly by scatter rather than by genuine differences between the apparent morphology in @xmath21 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "figure [ bandcomp.fig ] shows that for two galaxies with @xmath100 and @xmath101 the most obvious trend from @xmath21 to @xmath23 bands is an overall decrease in the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "given the similarity of the effect in both cases , it is not readily apparent why the two galaxies should have such different color dispersions .",
    "curiously , while @xmath88 has no obvious correlation with a visible difference in morphology between bands , it does correlate with the gini coefficient @xmath32 of a source ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ ginixi.fig ] ) in the sense that @xmath88 is ( on average ) slightly larger in the most nucleated sources .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the flux - weighting of @xmath88- high flux pixels have greater absolute variation between bandpasses and tend to dominate the sum in equation 7 , increasing @xmath88 for high @xmath32 sources where @xmath88 is dominated by variation from a few bright pixels rather than averaging over a larger number of lower - variation pixels for low @xmath32 sources . in conclusion , we caution that while @xmath88 is ideally a useful statistic , in the present case it may be too erratic to provide a great deal of information .",
    "we test the robustness of these parameters to cosmological distance by selecting one representative galaxy for each of the five general morphological categories ( defined previously in this section ) , artificially redshifting them through the range @xmath4 , and measuring the resulting morphologies using our variable threshhold pixel selection technique .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ ztrend.fig ] , in most cases we would measure consistent values for the morphological parameters for a given galaxy if it were located at any redshift throughout our sample .",
    "this constancy fails however for the most faint and nebulous of objects ( @xmath102 , green dot - dashed line in figure [ ztrend.fig ] ) , for which the multiplicity @xmath73 and the color dispersion @xmath88 can vary subtantially because the number of pixels in the segmentation map is small and random variations in noise can drastically affect both the locations of selected pixels ( to which @xmath73 is particularly sensitive ) and the residual color ( to which @xmath88 is sensitive ) .",
    "such objects represent less than 20% of the sample however , and the importance of this effect on @xmath73 may be mitigated by noting that @xmath73 is only well - defined up to @xmath103 .",
    "we also note a slight decrease in @xmath22 with redshift to @xmath104 , followed by a smaller upturn at @xmath105 .",
    "the first of these effects is consistent with our neglect of the change in angular size with redshift , and the second with the inclusion of a small number of sky pixels in the segmentation map when the selection threshhold is pushed down to 3@xmath24 .",
    "neither effect is large enough to noticeably impact our analysis .",
    "having demonstrated the uniformity of the selection technique , we consider what ( if any ) information is lost for galaxies in the lower end of the redshift range by effectively restricting our analysis to those pixels brighter than about @xmath106 above the background sky noise . in figure [ sbtrend.fig ]",
    "we plot morphological parameters calculated for the same five galaxies as before for a range of surface brightness selection threshholds .",
    "most obviously , @xmath22 decreases rapidly with increasing brightness threshhold since correspondingly fewer pixels are included in the segmentation map .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 declines noticeably as the lower - flux population is gradually omitted from the map . in contrast , @xmath73 and @xmath88 remain relatively constant throughout the range of selection threshholds considered , with the exception of purely nebulous sources ( dot - dashed green line ) for which we have previously noted the instability of these two parameters .",
    "most importantly however , if we neglect purely nebulous sources we note that the same _ relative _ information is preserved at all brightness threshholds- no matter what the threshhold it is equally possible to distinguish between the galaxy types despite the overall trends .",
    "that is , since the lines do not cross ( again with the exception of the green dot - dashed line and @xmath88 at very low threshholds ) we may be confident that we are not discarding information by using a @xmath107 segmentation map at lower redshifts .",
    "we now note a few caveats to this analysis which should be borne in mind .",
    "first , by using a fixed bandpass we have measured the morphologies of @xmath14 and @xmath17 galaxies at slightly different rest wavelengths .",
    "however , this effect should be negligible since our morphological parameters do not change substantially using data from the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 bandpasses ( although they can change somewhat in the @xmath23 bandpass due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio for all detections at near - ir wavelengths ) .",
    "parameters calculated in each of these bands correlate very strongly with one another , differences being dominated by the limiting surface brightness reached in each band . given that our sample consists of actively star - forming galaxies , this is perhaps not surprising since young massive stars tend to dominate the sed out to at least rest - frame blue wavelengths .",
    "second , we have neglected surface brightness evolution throughout our sample . since our primary goal is to investigate the physical meaning of morphology rather than providing a detailed comparison between samples at different redshifts we choose not to introduce uncertain corrections for such effects into our analysis .",
    "third , it is possible that some regions of flux included in our segmentation maps are due to chance alignments of some object at a very different redshift than the target galaxy .",
    "however , we judge this to be an unlikely major source of contamination to our sample since 1 ) the various pieces of the galaxies have consistent colors , and 2 ) the total number density of optically selected @xmath0 galaxies is @xmath5 10 arcmin@xmath108 to @xmath109 ( steidel et al . 2004 ) , giving a low probability for chance supposition of two unrelated galaxies within @xmath110 arcseconds .",
    "finally , we have made no correction for the effects of galaxy inclination to the line of sight .",
    "while it is conceivable , and indeed likely , that some of the variance in apparent morphology may be due simply to different orientations relative to the line of sight , our knowledge of these galaxies is at present insufficient to allow us to compensate for such effects in any meaningful way .",
    "of the four parameters which we have introduced , the @xmath32@xmath73 classification scheme best reproduces the morphological trends apparent to the eye .",
    "this system is illustrated in figure [ gallery.fig ] , which shows a representative set of galaxies from our sample and demonstrates how these two parameters serve to distinguish galaxies based on their degree of nucleation and number of components . since surface brightness dimming and bandshifting",
    "make it difficult to associate the morphologies of @xmath11 sources with galaxies in the local universe we avoid such direct , and potentially misleading comparisons .",
    "we describe the _ sense _ of our classification parameters by noting , however , that early - type galaxies typically are larger ( i.e. larger @xmath22 ) , more concentrated ( larger @xmath32 ) , less multiple ( lower @xmath73 ) , and have lower color dispersion ( @xmath88 ) than their late - type counterparts which are instead dominated by emission from multiple scattered knots of star formation . a more thorough overview of the relation between local and high - redshift galaxies is given by lpm04 .",
    "as part of an ongoing keck lris - b spectroscopic survey ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) we have compiled uv spectra of our 216 target galaxies in the goods - n field , and here explore how these spectra correspond to the morphology of their host galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , spectra of individual galaxies are rarely of sufficient quality to accurately measure the strengths of their emission / absorption components , and we therefore divide the spectra into five bins according to each of our four morphological parameters and measure the strengths of features in stacks of the spectra within these bins .",
    "we find that five bins gives a suitably large number of bins across which spectroscopic trends may be assessed while still producing reasonable quality stacked spectra ( each comprised of 30 galaxies at @xmath14 and 13 galaxies at @xmath17 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic combination method is similar to that described by shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . before stacking ,",
    "individual sky - subtracted spectra were flux - calibrated and shifted to the systemic rest frame using the prescriptions given by adelberger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , then resampled to a common dispersion of 1  pixel@xmath8 and rescaled to a common mode in the range @xmath111 .",
    "spectra were manually cropped to eliminate overly noisy segments due to falloff of the lris - b blue - side efficiency and of the red - side dichroic transmission .",
    "the resulting spectra were averaged using a min / max rejection of hot pixels , cosmic rays , and bad sky subtraction events ; three high and low values were rejected at each dispersion coordinate ( corresponding to a rejection of the high / low 10% for the @xmath14 sample ) .",
    "continuum normalization was performed by iteratively fitting a spline function to the stacked spectrum using wavelength intervals selected to be free of strong interstellar features , giving results consistent with the normalization method described by rix et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the rest - frame ultraviolet ( @xmath112 ) spectra of rest - uv color selected galaxies are typified ( fig .",
    "[ zspec.fig ] ) by redshifted lyman @xmath91 ( ly@xmath91 ) emission superposed on a broad blueshifted resonant absorption trough , and by strong velocity - broadened absorption lines due to energetic galaxy - scale outflows ( shapley et al .",
    "the strength of ly@xmath91 emission is originally governed by the rate of star formation and initial mass function ( imf ) in galactic hii regions , although this raw flux is significantly modified by resonant scattering from interstellar hi , generally culminating in its eventual absorption by interstellar dust and subsequent reradiation in the infrared .",
    "the observed ly@xmath91 emission strength is therefore a complex function of neutral hydrogen column density , dust fraction , and geometric / kinematic projection of the outflowing ism on the line of sight . typically , observed ly@xmath91 emission is redshifted by roughly 400 km s@xmath8 relative to the systemic velocity ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 , steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) , corresponding to scattering from the back side of outflowing ism , from which the doppler shift is suitable to take the photon off of resonance and permit it to escape the galaxy .",
    "other notable features include strong , optically thick absorption lines from low - ionization species ( e.g. siii  @xmath113 , siii  @xmath114 , oi+sii  @xmath115 , cii  @xmath116 , siii  @xmath117 , feii  @xmath118 , and alii  @xmath119 ) arising from outflowing neutral ism .",
    "as shown in figure [ zspec.fig ] , these absorption lines are blueshifted from the systemic redshift , corresponding to absorption from outflowing gas seen from the nearby side of a galaxy - wide outflow  their full widths can reach @xmath120 km  s@xmath8 ( pettini et al . 2002 ; shapley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we note that while oi+siii  @xmath121 ( a blend of the low ionization species oi  @xmath122 and siii  @xmath123 ) appears to be blended with a third component around @xmath124 ( resulting in a shallower blue - side slope for the composite line ) it is generally possible to deblend this additional component to measure oi+siii  @xmath121 alone .",
    "this broad @xmath124  feature is likely itself a blend of the stellar photospheric lines ciii  @xmath125 , siiii  @xmath126 , siiii  @xmath127 , and siiii  @xmath128 ( tremonti et al .",
    "2006 ) , variations in the relative strengths of which can shift the apparent centroid of the @xmath124  blend from @xmath129 to 1298 .",
    "also apparent are absorption lines due to higher - ionization species , including the siiv  @xmath130 doublet and civ absorption around @xmath131 .",
    "although all of these lines are blended with stellar features , civ is a particularly complex blend of interstellar absorption lines at @xmath132  and 1550 , combined with a p - cygni component from the winds of the most luminous o and b stars .",
    "we neglect the numerous additional features due to nebular , fine - structure , and stellar atmosphere transitions ( e.g. ciii  @xmath133 ; see shapley et al .",
    "2003 for a further list ) , since they are not generally detected to high statistical significance after the sample has been divided amongst five morphological bins .",
    "we refer the reader to shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein for further discussion of the physical interpretation of the rest - uv spectra .",
    "the equivalent widths of all absorption features were integrated non - parametrically relative to the normalized continuum .",
    "generally , features shortward of ly@xmath91 and longward of @xmath134   are considerably noisier than those between these wavelengths , and we therefore define average `` low - ionization '' and `` high - ionization '' absorption line strengths ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively ) as the weighted means of the shorter wavelength transitions siii  @xmath114 , oi+siii  @xmath115 , and cii  @xmath116 ( for @xmath135 ) and siiv  @xmath137   and @xmath138  ( for @xmath136 ) .",
    "the total equivalent width of the ly@xmath91 feature ( i.e. absorption plus emission ) tends to be strongly affected by the noisiness of the absorption trough , so we characterize the strength of the emission component alone .",
    "the equivalent width of emission ( @xmath139 ) is determined by dividing the total flux in the emission component by the continuum level which would be present in the absence of any absorption trough .",
    "it is possible to assess the statistical significance of possible deviations from a constant value by using the @xmath140 statistic @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the measured equivalent width for a given bin , @xmath143 is the mean equivalent width among all five bins , and @xmath144 is the square root of the natural variance among samples of randomly binned spectra . to within 5% . ]",
    "we find that @xmath144 is considerably larger than the uncertainty in the mean equivalent width for a given stack ( which belies the actual variance observed between randomly - drawn samples ) , and therefore adopt it as a conservative means of ensuring that any possible trends are more significant than would be likely to occur randomly .",
    "as such , the significance of a particular value of @xmath140 is evaluated using @xmath145 degrees of freedom to give the likelihood @xmath146 that deviations of the five measurements from a constant average value ( whether in the form of a monotonic trend or a single bin whose equivalent width varies greatly from the average with respect to the expected variance ) are greater than that expected from a random binning of the sample . applying this method to our measurements from randomly selected quintiles of galaxies , we determine that a threshhold of @xmath147 suffices to cull apparent associations due to random variance .",
    "as described in  4.1 , we bin the galaxy sample separately into quintiles according to each of the morphological parameters @xmath22 , @xmath32 , @xmath73 , and @xmath88 .",
    "bin divisions are determined so that each bin contains an identical number of galaxies ( i.e. 30 each for the @xmath14 sample , and 13 each for the @xmath17 sample ) , precise ranges are given in table [ granges.table ] . in all cases our spectra are broadly consistent with the diffuse light spectrum of local starburst galaxies ( e.g. chandar et al .",
    "2005 ) indicating that largely similar processes likely dominate the uv light output of all morphological types in our sample . despite this general similarity",
    "the spectra show some variation with morphology as demonstrated in figure [ speccor.fig ] , which we proceed to discuss in detail .",
    "we first note however the caveat that the position angles of the slits used to obtain our uv spectra have not been chosen to correspond to the major axis of each of the galaxies , and it is therefore possible for a few of the most widely separated sources with multiple components that the uv spectra may represent only one of the components . given the seeing limited nature of the spectroscopic observations and the fact that the typical size of our targets ( @xmath5 1 arcsecond ) is less than the width of the lris - b slit ( @xmath148 ) we doubt that this has a considerable effect .",
    "more likely perhaps is the probability that spectra are dominated by light from the bright nucleated regions of our sources and may not be expected to show any difference between nucleated and nucleated + nebulous sources if the spectrum of the nucleated regions are similar in each case .",

    "while this deviation may be a genuine product of physical phenomena its interpretation is unclear , particularly given the uncertain meaning of @xmath88 .",
    "as indicated by figure [ speccor.fig ] ( bottom row ) there are relatively many possible associations between ly@xmath91 emission strength and galaxy morphology , the simplest of which to interpret is the positive correlation between ly@xmath91 and the gini coefficient @xmath32 .",

    "it is unlikely that this trend is due to substantial variation of the composition or velocity of interstellar gas since such variations should also affect the strengths of absorption lines , which remain statistically constant across all values of @xmath32 ( see figs .",

    "a more plausible explanation may be that dust might be present in greater quantities in nebulous low-@xmath32 sources , causing greater attenuation of ly@xmath91 photons . under this hypothesis , it may be simply the presence of more or less dust which determines both the observed degree of uv nucleation and the strength of resonant ly@xmath91 emission .",

    "this high @xmath157 sample of high @xmath22 and moderate - high @xmath32 corresponds reasonably well to a particular morphological sample- the type 4 galaxies ( as identified in  3 ) which occupy a large angular area and tend to have bright nebulous emission paired with one or more distinct nucleations .",
    "these data suggest that larger , more uv luminous ( @xmath22 correlates well with uv luminosity- see  6 ) galaxies on average may have stronger outflows than the rest of the population , as might be expected if these galaxies have particularly energetic input to their interstellar media and are therefore capable of blowing the most energetic outflows .",
    "we caution however that the major discrepant point in both of these trends is for the most nebulous sample ( i.e. that with both small @xmath22 and small @xmath32 ) whose uv spectra are fainter and typically of slightly lower quality .    pairing this with the most significant understandable trend discovered in  5.1 and 5.2 , namely the positive correlation between @xmath32 and ly@xmath91 emission strength ,",

    "these correlations are unsurprising since @xmath22 effectively measures the number of uv bright pixels in a galaxy ( and a galaxy with large @xmath22 is hence likely to have a large total uv luminosity ) , and high values of @xmath32 are produced by relatively high concentrations of flux in a small percentage of the total number of uv bright pixels ( which occurs more commonly in galaxies with a high total uv luminosity to distribute ) .",
    "however , we note that the positive correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath211 may also ( at least in part ) have a more physical explanation ; if indeed nebulous low @xmath32 sources are dustier , then uv radiation from these galaxies would be more strongly attenuated than from less dusty high @xmath32 galaxies , contributing to the observed trend .",
    "the next most significant correlations relate @xmath22 , @xmath32 , @xmath172 ( the estimated reddening based on stellar population models and the far - uv spectral slope ) and the ratio of ir to uv luminosity ( @xmath190 , a proxy for uv attenuation ) .",
    "as quoted in table [ spearman.table ] , @xmath22 and @xmath32 are both negatively correlated with @xmath172 and @xmath190 ( at levels of significance ranging from about @xmath212 ) in the sense that the most attenuated galaxies tend to have smaller uv luminous areas ( low @xmath22 ) with weaker nucleation in the flux distribution ( low @xmath32 ) .",
    "although this correlation contains a great deal of scatter and does not hold precisely for every galaxy ( i.e. not all `` small and nebulous '' galaxies are highly extinguished ) , it nonetheless appears that _ statistically _ the most extinguished galaxies tend to be smaller and more nebulous than the general population .",
    "as previously hypothesized on the basis of ly@xmath91 emission strength , it may therefore be the case that galaxy morphology is dictated in part by the presence and location of dust which partially extinguishes the uv continuum radiation and causes galaxies to appear slightly smaller ( to a fixed limiting surface brightness ) and more nebulous .",

    "however , while no significant _ overall _ correlation was found by the spearman test , almost all ( 20/22 ) of the most strongly nucleated sources ( @xmath214 ) have masses greater than @xmath215 in contrast to those with @xmath216 which span a full two decades in stellar mass .",

    "however , this is not surprising given the strong association between total uv luminosity and morphology shown in table [ spearman.table ] . while it is likely that large ( high @xmath22 ) , nucleated ( high @xmath32 ) objects have a higher than average rate of _ uncorrected _ star formation it is not necessarily true that the same holds for the total star formation rate .",
    "indeed , in the majority of cases _ obscured _ star formation comprises the bulk of the total . rather than assuming an average extinction factor to estimate this from the uv luminosity , we estimate the obscured sfr from the ir luminosity @xmath243 calculated by reddy et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , adopting the @xmath244 sfr conversion factor given by kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",

    "the most accurate estimate of the total star formation rate may be found by summing the rates determined from uv and ir luminosities .",

    "for the first of these cases , no significant correlations are found with either the total or specific ( stellar mass - normalized ) star formation rate .",
    "we note however that the specific star formation rate is on the threshhold of statistical significance for a positive correlation with @xmath32 . if the eleven galaxies with stellar populations younger than 40 myr ( i.e. for which stellar population fits are the most uncertain ) are neglected in our analysis , this correlation becomes statistically significant , deviating from the null hypothesis by approximately @xmath246 .",
    "while therefore there is mild evidence for a positive correlation between uv nucleation and net star formation for galaxies directly detected at 24@xmath173 , this association is not at present statistically compelling .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath247-undetected sources all of the associations between morphology and uncorrected uv sfr are recovered for the total estimated sfr ( although this trend is smeared out by the division by mass for the specific sfr ) , largely because the obscured sfr extrapolated from total bolometric luminosity contributes only marginally to the total in these cases .",

    "this suggests a possible correlation between x - ray luminosity and uv nucleation , in the sense that agn which produce obvious x - ray radiation also contribute sufficiently to the total uv output of their host galaxies that the centralized agn radiation visibly affects the apparent nucleation of the uv light profile .",

    "distant red galaxies ( drg s , franx et al .",
    "2003 ) constitute another major ir - selected sample of high redshift galaxies for which there are five sources brighter than @xmath258 in the redshift range @xmath12 which meet the @xmath33 selection criteria and have secure spectroscopic redshifts , and eleven sources which do not but for which we measure reliable photometric redshifts .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ mosaicdrg.fig ] , the drg population is fainter and more nebulous in uv emission than any of the other galaxy samples considered , consistent with what may be expected for particularly dusty ir - bright galaxies given the apparent correlation between uv nucleation and dust extinction .",
    "as for the @xmath2 sample , the overlapping sample of @xmath33-selected drgs has morphological coefficients similar to the bulk of the @xmath33 population to within @xmath260 ( although it is on average slightly slightly smaller and more nebulous , see fig .",

    "it is those drg _ not _ selected by @xmath33 criteria however which particularly stand out- these galaxies ( fig .",

    "largely , this difference is a reflection of the much fainter uv luminosity of the drg sample- typical drg which do not meet the optical selection criteria have uv luminosities @xmath261 ( and commonly @xmath262 ) , as compared to the median luminosity for the optically selected sample @xmath263 .",
    "similarly to the @xmath2 sample , the apparent multiplicity @xmath73 for drgs is again consistent with the @xmath33 sample , although the color dispersion @xmath88 is roughly @xmath264 lower and is consistent with zero ( the value expected for a pure measurement of the background sky ) .",
    "the submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) population offers the opportunity to compare the rest - uv morphologies of optically - selected galaxies with those in a similar redshift range ( @xmath0 ) which are selected on the basis of submillimeter flux . using the catalog of smg coordinates and spectroscopic redshifts compiled by chapman et al .",

    "the wide range of morphological types covered by the smg selection criteria are shown in figure [ mosaicsmg.fig ] and range from single , nucleated sources to extremely faint and nebulous , and include one strong high - redshift spiral galaxy candidate ( bzk 294- see dawson et al .",
    "2003 ) . on average however , the smg population has a morphology similar to that of the @xmath33-selected sample ( fig .",

    "( 2003b ) , whose _ hst_-stis imaging led them to conclude that the smg sample had lower surface brightness than typical @xmath17 lbgs , yet was slightly larger _ for the reduced surface brightness_.    additionally , conselice et al .",
    "( 2003b ) also find that the asymmetry index @xmath30 of their sample of eleven smgs is slightly greater on average than that of optically - selected @xmath17 lbgs , which these authors conclude implies a greater major merger fraction for the submillimeter - bright sample .",
    "however , we find no statistically significant change in our multipliticy parameter @xmath73 ( which most closely measures the morphological irregularity of a source ) . if the morphologies of the smg sample are governed by the same physical processes as the optically - selected galaxies ( as seems likely given the two samples appear to fall on the same trend of dustiness versus bolometric luminosity for star - forming galaxies at @xmath14 ; reddy et al .",
    "2006b ) then when considered non - parametrically we conclude that the smg sample may be no more likely to be dominated by major mergers than other @xmath0 galaxy samples .",
    "through a comprehensive statistical analysis , we have found two key trends with morphology .",
    "first , the degree of nucleation / nebulosity is related to the uv / optical extinction of the source ( as parametrized through both the value of @xmath172 calculated from stellar population models and the ratio of ir to uv luminosity ) , suggesting that more nebulous sources may appear as such since their greater quantities of dust obscure a great quantity of the uv light .",
    "second , physically larger , more uv luminous sources have rest - uv emission and absorption lines seperated by a greater velocity , indicating that they may drive more energetic outflows than their lower luminosity counterparts .",
    "however , we note that these trends are typically on the order of @xmath265 significance , and are far from being unambiguously convincing morphological differences . indeed , given the relatively large sample of galaxies and volume of spectrophotometric data compiled to date , the overall _ lack _ of correlation between morphology and fundamental galactic properties such as stellar mass , sfr , and outflows is more remarkable .",
    "to some degree this may be due to the unknown distribution of viewing angles , but whether as a result of this complication or a more fundamental process the rest - uv morphologies of high redshift galaxies generally do not appear to contain a great deal of separable information .",
    "if morphologies truly mean so little , this may help explain the lack of correlation seen between elongated morphologies and major axis velocity shear by erb et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found that morphologically elongated galaxies are no more likely than compact galaxies to exhibit kinematic signatures of rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note the implications of these findings for the major - merger hypothesis which posits that , similarly to luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) in the local universe , particularly irregular morphologies correspond to major galaxy mergers ( e.g. conselice et al .",
    "2003 , chapman et al .",
    "2003 , lpm04 , lotz et al .",
    "in particular , conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) adopt the asymmetry selection criterion @xmath266 to identify major mergers , and interpret the increase in galaxy irregularity with redshift out to @xmath17 to indicate a higher merger fraction in the early universe and evidence for hierarchical formation .",
    "if the most irregular galaxies truly represent such major events however , we might reasonably expect these galaxies to differ significantly from their non - merging counterparts in some additional way , perhaps by displaying tidally enhanced rates of star formation or broadened interstellar absorption lines due to the juxtaposition of the ism of two or more galaxies with relative velocity differences of order a few hundred km s@xmath8 .",
    "however , we find no evidence for such a distinction between any of a variety of morphological samples , suggesting that either major mergers at @xmath0 are largely indistinguishable from the non - merging sample , that _ all _ @xmath0 galaxies are experiencing major merger induced starbursts , or simply that irregular morphology ( at least to within @xmath5 13 kpc at rest - uv wavelengths ) is not a reliable indicator of a major merger .",
    "while it is possible that major mergers may be distinguishable on the basis of multiple components beyond our 13 kpc detection threshhold , it seems unlikely that such systems would produce changes as profound as may be found on closer passes .",
    "supposing then that irregular , multi - component morphologies do _ not _ represent bursts of star formation in the orbiting galaxies and satellite galaxies of a major merger , another possibility is that these systems may instead represent patchy star formation occuring from the collapse of local instabilities within galactic molecular clouds .",
    "combined with the complicating effects of dust and viewing angle , such an explanation may fit the local lbg - analog vv 114 , based on the uv and near - ir imaging of goldader et al .",
    "it is also possible that , in some small number of cases , multi - component morphologies may reflect objects which are nearby in projection , but unrelated due to large differences in redshift .",
    "while individual components of multi - component objects have not been spectroscopically confirmed to be associated however , the angular distribution of sources suggests that such projection effects should contribute minimally to the total population .",
    "finally , we note that while the rest - uv and rest - optical morphologies of @xmath0 galaxies are similar in the majority of cases ( as shown by dickinson 2000 ) and appear to contain little separable information , there is a small sub - sample of these galaxies for which the optical morphologies appear considerably more regular and `` evolved '' than their uv counterparts ( toft et al .",
    ". it may be the case that this small population of galaxies has rest - optical morphologies which are easier to interpret than the majority of the galaxy sample , and may have useful correlations between rest - optical morphology and spectrophotometric or kinematic indices .",
    "in particular , such galaxies are intriguing possible targets for future kinematic study with the aid of ao - assisted integral - field spectroscopy ( e.g. forster - schreiber et al .",
    "2006 ; law et al .",
    "2006 ) , which could demonstrate whether these galaxies are any more likely than the rest of the galaxy sample to contain tractable meaning in their luminous spatial structures .",
