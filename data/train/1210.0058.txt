    "much attention has been paid in the past decade to the study of heat conduction in 1d and 2d systems via their underlying dynamics . the main question to be answered",
    "is how the fourier law of heat conduction is related to the microscopic dynamics of the system . on the one hand ,",
    "a convergent conductivity has been shown in the ding - a - ling model @xcite ( where oscillators exchange energy via intermediate hard spheres ) , which is chaotic , and in the lorentz channel ( a channel with circular scatterers placed periodically ) which is fully hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the fermi - pasta - ulam chain , where oscillators are coupled to non - linear terms , heat conductivity is abnormal even above the chaotic threshold @xcite ; while the serpent billiard , a channel with parallel semi - circular walls , exhibits marginally normal diffusion even under conditions of global chaos @xcite .",
    "since normal diffusion is at the root of normal heat transport and abnormal diffusion leads to abnormal heat transport @xcite , the latter system can not obey fourier s law .",
    "thus , the positivity of the lyapunov exponent is neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for inducing normal transport properties , since there are billiard gas models ( polygonal channels ) with linear dynamical instability and yet they exhibit normal transport properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , it seems that for chaotic systems a strong degree of chaos , which translates into a global chaotic dynamics , is required to obtain normal transport properties .",
    "although the precise conditions behind the onset of fourier s law remain unknown despite decades of intensive studies , many interesting properties of the heat mechanism have been discovered , including the possibility of controlling heat flux : for example , there are 1d chains that act as thermal rectifiers @xcite , billiard models where particle interactions ( or an external magnetic field ) produce thermal rectification @xcite and graded systems in which rectification does not decay with system size @xcite .",
    "moreover , a temporally alternating bath temperature can be used to generate a steady heat flow against a thermal bias @xcite , while an important increasing of the thermoelectric efficiency is reported in billiard - like systems @xcite . another interesting , related issue is the possibility of controlling the stochastic transport of particles ( in the absence of a thermal gradient ) which can be achieved in systems possessing spatial or dynamical symmetry breaking with the aid of external unbiased input signals @xcite .",
    "much attention has been paid to billiard systems when they exhibit strong chaos ( global chaos ) , but few studies have focused on the relation between the degree of chaos in the system and their transport properties @xcite , despite the importance of this issue , as in many systems chaotic and regular dynamics coexist . in addition , the system introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is a peculiar chaotic system whose phase space does not have the typical kam structure of generic hamiltonian systems . while diffusion in systems ( quasi-1d cosine billiard ) with kam phase space structure is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but no connection with the thermal transport properties is probed .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of our study is to analyze the effect of the degree of chaos on the thermal transport properties of systems with kam phase space structure .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider a two - dimensional billiard model formed by two sinusoidal walls .",
    "the two ends of the channel are connected to gaussian - type thermal baths ( see fig . [ fig6 ] ) and the corresponding infinite length channel has an infinite horizon .",
    "the average width of the channel chosen is much smaller than its length in order to keep kinetic excitation in the transverse direction frozen .",
    "the study of thermal properties in this system is interesting because it exhibits poincar sections with a kam structure typical of generic hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , at small ripple amplitudes , we obtain an estimation of the temperature profile and heat flux by means of an effective potential .",
    "the result of our estimation is corroborated by numerical calculations .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii we introduce the model and discuss the dynamic properties of the system . sec .",
    "iii focuses on the study of the thermal transport properties of the channel when ripple amplitude is small . for this case",
    ", we use the effective potential mentioned in the previous section to obtain analytical results for the stationary heat flux and temperature profile .",
    "section iv examines how the degree of chaos affects the thermal transport properties in the channel , focusing on the point at which the transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics occurs . when the ripple amplitude is sufficiently large , the results are compared to those obtained for the lorentz channel and for the system introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , concluding remarks are presented .",
    "we considered an infinite channel formed by two sinusoidal walls ; the profiles of the upper and lower walls , respectively , are determined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the ripples , @xmath4 denotes the phase difference between the upper and lower walls , and @xmath5 is half of the average width of the channel .",
    "all quantities are rescaled to the length @xmath6 of one period . in this study",
    ", we consider the following fixed values : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "when we take other values for @xmath4 , the main conclusions of this paper remain essentially the same .",
    "the dynamics of a particle that collides specularly with the rippled walls can be described qualitatively by the poincar section @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-coordinate of the particle and @xmath12 the angle that the trajectory of the particle forms with the positive @xmath11-axis just after the @xmath13-th collision with any wall . to obtain all possible orbits in the poincar section ( ps ) , several initial conditions @xmath14",
    "must be taken into account . here",
    ", @xmath15 is a point in the configuration space that corresponds to the initial @xmath11- and @xmath16-coordinates of the particle , while @xmath17 is the angle that the initial trajectory of the particle forms with the positive @xmath11-axis at the departure point @xmath15 . due to the periodicity of the channel ,",
    "the structure of the ps is periodic ; therefore , we may choose the @xmath11-domain in the interval @xmath18 $ ] , which corresponds to two ripple periods , so as to obtain a complete panorama of the dynamics of the system .",
    "poincar plots for four different values of @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figu2 ] .",
    "when the ripple amplitude is small , the dynamics of the system is regular and poincar sections resemble the phase space of a one - dimensional pendulum ( see fig . [",
    "figu2](a ) ) .",
    "the elliptical orbits correspond to particles trapped in the channel that move adiabatically backwards and forwards around a stable fixed point .",
    "the trajectories outside the librational region represent a particle traveling to the left ( @xmath19 ) or right ( @xmath20 ) of the channel ( rotational motion ) .",
    "when @xmath3 is increased , the dynamics is still regular up to @xmath21 , and the region of librational motion occupies a larger size . for the interval @xmath22 the separatrix becomes chaotic with some sizable width ( see fig .",
    "[ figu2](b ) ) that increases as ripple amplitude becomes larger .",
    "there are two kam curves ( kam barriers ) that forbid the connection of all chaotic regions .",
    "they are found in the limits between the red region ( light gray ) and the blue region ( dark gray ) shown in fig [ figu2](b ) .",
    "therefore , motion is unidirectional for initial conditions lying outside both the librational region and the chaotic separatrix ( we refer to this situation as unidirectional mixed chaos ) .",
    "there is a critical value of ripple amplitude ( @xmath23 ) at which all chaotic regions are connected due to the destruction of the kam curves . in this case",
    ", we found a first order resonant island surrounded by a chaotic sea ( see fig .",
    "[ figu2](c ) ) and the reversal of the travel direction , for initial conditions falling outside the librational region , is now possible ( we refer to this situation as bidirectional mixed chaos ) .",

    "expression ( [ critical1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath58 the condition of adiabatic invariance and the critical angles have been used previously to arrive at estimates of the electronic transport properties in rippled channels when the poincar plots of the associate dynamical system exhibit a pendulum - like phase space @xcite .",
    "this section considers a finite version of the channel discussed in the previous section .",

    "the channel is placed between two heat baths at temperatures @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , modeled by stochastic kernels of gaussian type by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the probability distribution of the velocities for the particles emerging from the baths .",
    "the values of @xmath59 are such that @xmath68 ; hence , the number of particles that can cross the channel without colliding with the rippled walls is much lower than that of those which will have collisions .    due to the fact that the particles do not interact among themselves ,",
    "the motion of a single particle is considered over a long time period as it collides with the rippled walls and thermal baths .",
    "collisions with the rippled boundaries are specular , and the velocity of the particle just after a collision with a thermal bath is determined by the distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ distri ] ) . following the ideas from ref .",
    "@xcite , we divide the configuration space into slices @xmath69 ( eventually a slice will be taken as a fundamental cell ) .",
    "the time that the particle spends in the slice in the @xmath70-th visit is denoted by @xmath71 , and the total number of times that the particle crosses @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "the temperature of the slice @xmath72 is defined by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the kinetic energy of the particle at the @xmath70-th visit of the slice @xmath72 .",
    "the heat flux of one particle can be defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy change of the particle at the @xmath78-th collision with a thermal bath , and @xmath79 is the total time that the particle takes to collision @xmath80 times with a thermal bath .",
    "the correct way to obtain the thermodynamic limit is to keep the number of particles per cell fixed as the size @xmath59 of the channel increases .",
    "for instance , if a single particle per cell is considered , then the heat flux in a channel of @xmath59 length is @xmath81 .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath82 is determined by @xmath83 where we have defined the thermal conductivity through the fourier law of heat conduction .",
    "the next step is to obtain an expression of the temperature profile and heat flux in the stationary regime for the case of a small ripple amplitude . in the interests of simplicity , but without losing generality , the slices @xmath69 are assumed to be equal to the fundamental cells .",
    "for sufficiently small ripple amplitudes , the librational orbits , or rotational orbits near the separatrix , represent a particle bouncing off the walls almost perpendicularly .",
    "thus , the time in the @xmath70-th visit that the particle spends within the slide @xmath84 ( which is in direct contact with the hot bath ) for these rotational orbits is given , approximately , by @xmath85 while for the librational orbits , we have @xmath86 @xmath87 denotes the velocity in the @xmath11-direction just after the @xmath78-th collision with any wall ( the @xmath11-coordinate of the particle at the @xmath78-th collision with any wall ) during the @xmath70-th visit to cell @xmath84 . @xmath88 as a function of @xmath89 is determined using the effective potential given by eq .",

    "particles emerging from the thermal baths can not have access to librational orbits in @xmath72 cells with @xmath105 ; thus the motion in these cells is rotational .",
    "rotational orbits that do not lie near the separatrix are almost flat as shown in fig 2(a ) ; so @xmath106 .",
    "a rotational orbit near the separatrix means that its corresponding initial condition satisfies @xmath107 . for rotational orbits that do not lie near the separatrix",

    "equation ( [ time ] ) can be developed in power series of @xmath110 , but we decide not to present the expansion because as we approached an initial condition that falls near the separatrix , it became necessary to include more terms of the expansion ; while for an initial condition that falls exactly on the separatrix all terms of the expansion must be included .",

    "@xmath33 is the same for particles coming from any heat bath because the spatial separation of the baths is equal to an integer number .",

    "the theoretical predictions for these deviations agree with the numerical simulation . in the case of a flat channel ( @xmath128 ) @xmath129 and the temperature profile",
    "is completely flat with value @xmath130 , this result is exact and can be corroborated directly using definition ( [ prom1 ] ) .    using a similar procedure that made it possible to obtain analytical results for the temperature profile , we obtain the following expression for heat flux @xmath131 where the resulting factor @xmath59 in the denominator comes from the periodicity of the rotational motion , and from the fact that a particle executing this kind of motion must travel through @xmath59 cells of unit length before colliding with the other thermal bath . at the limit @xmath132 ,",
    "heat flux becomes independent of system size and thermal conductivity scales as @xmath133 .",
    "we have corroborated numerically that the latter scaling behavior is valid as long as the system exhibits regular dynamics . in the latter case ,",

    "[ figu3](b ) shows . we should point out an unexpected behavior of increasing heat flux when @xmath3 is increased to a maximum value at @xmath134 , when chaotic behavior appears",
    "this behavior can be explained as follows : the particles executing librational motion do not contribute to heat flux because they never reach the other side of the channel .",
    "this fact is associated with the term @xmath135 in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) , which decreases as ripple amplitude is increased .",
    "however , the average time that the particle takes to travel from one thermal bath to the other becomes smaller as ripple amplitude increases , because only particles with larger velocity components in the @xmath11-direction can reach the other side of the channel .",

    "the ratio @xmath177 decreases as ripple amplitude is increased , this is simply a consequence of the reduction of the number of particles that can travel arbitrarily far without colliding with the walls , as ripple amplitude becomes larger . in this sense",
    ", we can say that diffusion approaches normal behavior as ripple amplitude increases ; hence , the same statement is also valid for heat flux . the marginally anomalous diffusion exhibited by our system ( in the case of bidirectional chaos )",
    "provides evidence that the contribution to the velocity auto - correlation function from particles having collisions at time @xmath0 decays faster than @xmath167 .",
    "then , if the particles that can travel arbitrarily far without interacting with the walls were not present , diffusion should be normal .",
    "this argument indicates that normal diffusion can take place in systems with mixed phase space when there are not kam curves that preclude connection of all chaotic regions , and when non - chaotic trajectories do not contribute to heat transport .",
    "it must be stressed that for cases iii and iv , all initial conditions of the particles coming from the thermal baths fall on the chaotic sea .",
    "however , if we place the thermal baths such that the initial conditions of these particles can have access to periodic and quasi - periodic orbits , exponents @xmath152 and @xmath157 should be insensitive to this change because particles executing periodic or quasi - periodic motion do not contribute to heat flux for they are reinjected into the same bath from which they originally came .",

    "[ figu5 ] .",
    "it is clear that in case i the temperature profiles in the central part of the channel are linear and maintain a similar shape for different system sizes .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that presented in references @xcite , when the first system have no disorder and the second one exhibits regular dynamics .",
    "there are jump discontinuities in the temperature profile for cases i and ii at the ends of the channel .",
    "this phenomenon is the result of boundary heat resistance that usually appears when there is a heat flux across the interface of two adjacent materials ( see .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these jumps are finite size effects because as the system size increases boundary heat resistance decreases , as do the temperature jumps .",

    "the numerical simulation and temperature profile predicted by this formula have a similar shape but are displaced ( see fig . [ figu5](a ) ) .",

    ", there is a discrepancy between formula ( [ ant ] ) and ( [ teo23 ] ) , since the former predicts a flat profile given by @xmath204 , while formula ( [ teo23 ] ) also predicts a flat temperature profile with the value @xmath205 , but the latter flat temperature profile is an analytical exact result that can be obtained directly from definition ( [ tem ] ) .",
    "when the formula ( [ ant ] ) was derived , a definition of temperature in terms of the mean density of particles at the cell @xmath72 was used .",
    "nevertheless , definition ( [ tem ] ) is the time average of kinetic energy at cell @xmath72 ; therefore , these two definitions lead to different temperature profiles that are only equal when diffusion is normal .",
    "this explains the clear discrepancy between our numerical simulations and eq .",
    "( [ ant ] ) for case i. in any case , both definitions of temperature lead to temperature profiles that are closely related to diffusion exponent @xmath157 for sufficiently large system sizes .",
    "if a system obeys fourier s law ( @xmath206 ) , then the formula derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "in addition , when the temperature difference of the reservoirs is small , the typical linear temperature profile will be obtained .",
    "we analyzed the thermal transport properties of a sinusoidal channel placed between two gaussian type thermal baths .",
    "the dynamics of a particle moving in the corresponding infinite length channel exhibits poincar plots with a kam structure typical of generic hamiltonian systems .",
    "when the ripple amplitude is small , the dynamics of the system is regular . for this case",
    ", estimates of the heat flux and temperature profile were obtained using an effective potential .",
    "specifically , the temperature profile of the central part of the channel is well approximated by a flat profile given by the geometric average of the temperatures of the two reservoirs .",
    "consequently , the same result is to be expected for other billiard systems with similar dynamics . in the regime of regular dynamics ,",
    "the thermal conductivity scales with the system size as @xmath133 for sufficiently large system size and the diffusion of particles is ballistic .",
    "unidirectional mixed chaos appears as the ripple amplitude is increased ; and the mean square displacement can be approximated by @xmath207 ( being @xmath208 a constant ) for a relative long time period . when bidirectional mixed chaos appears , the mean square displacement grows asymptotically as @xmath209 , then diffusion exponent is time dependent , but it remains practically constant for relative long time periods .",
    "temperature profiles were also analyzed for different degrees of chaos in the system , and it was found that the diffusion exponent is closely related to the temperature profile of the system .      1 g. casati , j. p. ford , f. vivaldi , and w. m. visscher , _ phys .",
