    "the advection of chemically or biologically active particles in imperfectly mixing chaotic hydrodynamical flows received considerable recent interest @xcite . by chaotic",
    "we understand a smoothly time - dependent , in the simplest case periodic , flow in which the advection dynamics of tracers is chaotic .",
    "these tracers undergo chemical or biological interactions while being advected by two - dimensional flows .",
    "the distribution of the products along a filamental fractal seems to be a general feature of such reactions .",
    "here we consider tracers as point - like particles which are assumed not to have any influence on the fluid flow itself .",
    "the reaction model is of kinetic type where the reactions take place upon particle - particle ` collisions ' : when particles of type @xmath1 and @xmath2 are closer to each other than a _ reaction range _ @xmath3 , then particle @xmath1 changes to @xmath2 according to the autocatalytic scheme @xmath0 .",
    "the reaction model is discrete in time , i.e. , a reaction can only take place at integer multiples of a _ reaction time _ @xmath4",
    ". in intervals between successive reactions the particles are passively advected by the flow .",
    "the passive advection dynamics has two essential parameters that influence the reaction kinetics of the process : a decay or contraction parameter @xmath5 and the fractal dimension @xmath6 of the set around which products accumulate . in open flows",
    "this set turns out to be the unstable manifold of a nonescaping chaotic set characterizing the passive advection @xcite , and the role of the contraction parameter is played by the average negative lyapunov exponent of the lagrangian dynamics which expresses the convergence towards the chaotic set . due to incompressibility",
    ", the positive and negative lyapunov exponents have the same absolute value .",
    "particles are advected away from any neighborhood of the chaotic set along the unstable manifold which leads to an exponential decay of the passive particles with an escape rate @xmath7 .",
    "this is , however , not a new dynamical parameter since it is related to the previous ones via @xmath8 , @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on _ slow _ reactions whose reaction velocity * @xmath9 * is much slower than the characteristic velocity of the passive advection dynamics .    in this section",
    "we present a heuristic argument for the total area of the product particles as a function of time .",
    "since the basic ingredients of the argument are the existence of a fractal backbone and the contracting dynamics acting towards the backbone , we do not need to actually specify the two - dimensional hydrodynamical flow itself just to postulate the fractal backbone and the contraction property .",
    "we consider the simplest filamental fractal which is the direct product of a cantor set of dimension @xmath10 and a line segment of length @xmath11 so that the total dimension is @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , a contraction of rate @xmath5 is postulated towards the fractal filaments , see figure  [ fig : sema ] .",
    "this simple theory can also be considered to hold for reactions taking place along spatially fixed fractal catalysts when there is transport of products , resulting in an effective contraction .",
    "= 5.0 in    at time @xmath12 , right after a reaction takes place , filaments are assumed to be covered by material @xmath2 in stripes of average width @xmath13 .",
    "the complement of these strips is assumed to be covered by material @xmath1 everywhere . during the next period of length @xmath4 no reaction takes place , only contraction , which reduces the widths @xmath13 by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "the effect of the reaction is simply an ` infection ' by @xmath2 particles of the @xmath1 neighbors in circles of radii @xmath3 which in case of a filamental geometry leads to the broadening of the stripe width by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "thus we obtain a recursion relation expressing the stripe widths @xmath17 right after the @xmath18-st reaction in terms of @xmath13 , right after the @xmath12-th reaction : @xmath19 this simple recursive dynamics possesses a single fixed point attractor @xmath20 which is reached for @xmath21 .",
    "this shows that the product distribution reaches saturation : an active steady state sets in after some time in which the activity exactly cancels the material loss due to contraction .",
    "although there are infinitely many filaments in the fractal backbone , if they are covered with stripes of non - zero width , the number of such covered filaments becomes finite due to the overlaps among them .",
    "it follows from the properties of fractals that the number @xmath22 of filaments covered by width @xmath23 is @xmath24 the total area @xmath25 of these covered filaments is then @xmath26 next we apply this result with @xmath27 at time @xmath12 and with @xmath28 at time @xmath29 .",
    "note that we are then working on the egde of the validity of fractal scaling since below the scale of @xmath13 or @xmath17 the product distribution is two - dimensional .",
    "the consequences of the crudeness of this approximation will be analyzed later , in view of the exact results obtained for the baker map . using ( [ aaa ] ) , one finds a recursion for the area @xmath30 of @xmath2 particles .",
    "it follows from ( [ rec ] ) that @xmath31^{1/(2-d_0 ) } +    g \\sigma l^\\frac{d_0}{2-d_0 } \\right\\}^{2-d_0}.    \\label{eq : mapauto}\\ ] ] in the case of exactly parallel filaments the factor @xmath32 is identically @xmath33 before the stripes start to overlap . after overlap takes place , which is unavoidable on sufficiently fine scales , the value of @xmath32 may however differ from 2 . in this approach , we assume that the overlap effects can be taken care by introducing an _ average _ geometrical factor @xmath32 , which is _ independent _ of the reaction parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if the proportionality factor in ( [ aaa ] ) , which is the hausdorff measure of the fractal set , is different from 1 , it may also be incorporated in the geometrical factor @xmath32 .",
    "the form of recursion ( [ eq : mapauto ] ) is a lot more complicated than recursion ( [ rec ] ) for the stripe widths due to the fractal character of the backbone .",
    "it shows that the ` microscopic ' width dynamics and the ` macroscopic ' area dynamics are qualitatively different since the latter is nonlinear",
    ". nevertheless , ( [ eq : mapauto ] ) possesses a fixed point @xmath34 which is the only attractor of the chemical dynamics .",
    "it is worth taking a continuum limit in which the reaction time @xmath4 and distance @xmath3 both go to zero , while the reaction velocity @xmath35 remains finite . in this limit",
    "a differential equation is obtained for the @xmath2 area @xmath36 as a function of the continuous time @xmath37 in the form @xmath38 where the exponent @xmath39 is a unique positive expression of the fractal dimension @xmath40 the singular - looking reaction term on the right hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ diffeq ] ) expresses the fact that the smaller the area , the larger the production rate becomes , just as one expects for reactions on a fractal catalyst .    both the discrete - time and",
    "the continuous - time area dynamics possess a fixed point steady state .",
    "the corresponding product area of the latter is @xmath41 note that this is much larger than the product area along a single non - fractal line ( obtained as the special case @xmath42 ) since the expression in the paranthesis is much less than unity in view of our assumption of the slowness of the active dynamics .",
    "this clearly indicates that the presence of a fractal catalyst makes the reactions much more efficient .",
    "the important caveat is that the fractal backbone is not introduced ` by hand ' as an imposed mixing rule , it is rather generated naturally by the _",
    "chaotic advection dynamics _ of the fluid flow transporting the tracers .",
    "the chaotic set is the union of unstable bounded orbits .",
    "the reactions take place along the outflow curves from these orbits ( the unstable manifold ) . for a time",
    "periodic flow the unstable manifold moves periodically in the plane of the flow ( but does not change its fractal dimension ) .",
    "this is , however , not a basic difference since on a stroboscopic map the manifold appears to be still .    in order to illustrate and also check the above general heuristic arguments , in this paper we consider two variants of the baker map , which describe a discrete mixing dynamics with hyperbolic chaotic properties .",
    "these maps are simple enough to facilitate an exact analytic approach and yet they incorporate the generic features of mixing from realistic flows . within this model",
    "we are able to derive exact expressions for the area dynamics and thus to identify the geometric factor , which was not possible within the phenomenological theories of active chaos .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : active ] we introduce a simple variant of the baker map on which we superimpose the chemical activity , introducing thus a novel reactive dynamical system , the _ active baker map_. then we derive the exact stripe dynamics for this map , including the reaction equation describing the area dynamics of the reactants in the system . in section [ sec : compare ] we compare the exact expressions with the heuristic results given in the introduction , identifying the exact effects of the fractal geometry on the geometric factor . in section [ sec : another ] we consider a second variant for the baker map , and show the robustness of the heuristic results .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discussions and outlook .",
    "the passive ( reaction - free ) baker map is probably the simplest dynamical system which exhibits chaotic behaviour of purely hyperbolic type . its simplicity allows for analytic manipulations , and thus it plays from a theoretical standpoint a crucial role , comparable to the ising model from statistical mechanics .",
    "there are several variants to this map , and we shall consider two of them in more detail .",
    "let us give first one variant of the baker map and then define the active version based on this , then in sec .",
    "[ sec : another ] introduce another variant with the associated active counterpart , and then finally compare the results based on the actual realizations of the maps .",
    "assuming that we start from a completely filled unit square , one step of the baker map consists of the following : 1 ) the lower ( upper ) half of the unit square is compressed in the @xmath43 direction by a factor of @xmath44 around the fixed point in @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , and then 2 ) the compressed stripes are stretched along the @xmath47 direction ( around the same fixed points ) by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 there will be ` material ' reaching over the unit square , which is clipped and discarded . in this case",
    "the map is modeling an open flow . by taking the unit square as the phase space of the baker map ,",
    "the characteristic length @xmath11 of the dynamics is chosen to be unity .",
    "when @xmath50 , the baker map is area preserving in the sense that its jacobian is uniformly unity , however , it is an open chaotic map for any @xmath51 , the chaos being of transient type @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the image @xmath52 through the baker map of a point @xmath53 from the unit square is given by : @xmath54 \\\\ y'=by-(b-1)\\theta\\left(y-1/2\\right)\\;,\\;\\ ; \\;\\;\\;y\\in[0,1 ] \\label{bakerorig } \\end{array } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the map is not defined outside the unit square ( i.e.  @xmath56 ) and thus chemical reactions can only occur inside the unit square . in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to open area preserving systems , i.e. , to the regime @xmath57 .",
    "repeated application of the map will result in a sequence of vertical stripes of various widths which form the hierarchy of a one dimensional cantor set in the unit interval along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "contraction towards the vertical filaments is governed by the lyapunov exponent @xmath58 since due to the construction , in the vertical direction there is no structure , the map is effectively one dimensional . the fractal dimension @xmath59 of the cantor set on which the stripes reside ,",
    "is simply calculated to be : @xmath60 the decay of the area covered by the material left in the unit square is exponential , with a rate given by the so called escape rate , @xmath7 : @xmath61 so that @xmath62 holds for the fractal dimension of the stripes in the unit square .",
    "initially , the empty space between the stripes is imagined to be filled with ` material ' @xmath1 , while the stripes contain material @xmath2 .",
    "we call the baker map _ active _ when the two materials react with each other .",
    "we consider autocatalytic reactions @xmath0 ( the same as in the introduction ) , with the reactions happening along the ( vertical ) contact lines .",
    "this reaction can alternatively be considered simply as the surface - growth of material @xmath2 , and leads to a broadening of the stripes relative to those of the passive baker map .",
    "we assume that the reactions happen instantaneously and simultaneously in the system , _ after every",
    "_ @xmath4 steps of the reaction - free baker map .",
    "time is measured in units of the baker - steps .",
    "thus , for @xmath63 , the @xmath2 surface grows after each baker - step by an amount of @xmath3 on each side of a stripe . for @xmath64 ,",
    "two reaction - free baker - steps are taken before one instantaneous reaction occurs , etc .",
    "= 5.8 in    for the simplicity of writing , let us introduce the following convention : passive steps will be called _ baker - steps _ , and the combination of @xmath4 baker - steps followed immediately by one reaction will be called one _ active - step_.    if the gap between two stripes is shorter than @xmath65 , the gap disappears during reaction , and the stripes merge into a single one . in the absence of reactions ( @xmath66 ) the steady state",
    "( defined as the asymptotic state @xmath67 ) is characterized by a zero lebesque - measure distribution of material @xmath2 , covering the _ unstable manifold of teh chaotic set _ of dimension @xmath6 of the baker map . in the case of the active baker map ,",
    "however , there are new @xmath2-areas of width @xmath3 appearing after periods @xmath4 in the system , and thus a sort of dynamical balance is expected to set in between the escape dynamics and the growth dynamics .      in spite of the fact that the baker map is one of the simplest maps that exhibits chaotic dynamics , when chemical activity is also introduced , the reaction kinetics of the system becomes rather involved .",
    "let us first start with the simpler case of one reaction per baker - step , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : themap ] shows the succession of two such active - steps .",
    "the black bands show the @xmath2 material coming from the first reaction , while the dotted light gray bands are the @xmath2 material emerging from the second reaction . from the point of view of the reaction kinetics ,",
    "the distribution and the amount of material @xmath1 ( the gaps ) is crucial .",
    "if an @xmath1 stripe is less wide than @xmath65 then it will fill up in the next reaction and disappears . during the baker - steps",
    "the hierarchy of gaps builds up with thinner and thinner gaps appearing . from a certain level on",
    ", the reactions are putting a stop to the hierarchy growth .",
    "the question is how in the long time limit the picture stabilizes and the system settles into a stationary state .",
    "every gap is bounded from left and right by material @xmath2 . since the contraction by @xmath69 is a point transformation ( around the two fixed points at the edges ) , each gap will shrink by a factor of @xmath69 and it will also get closer to the corresponding fixed point by the same factor @xmath69 . after the reaction the gaps will lose @xmath65 from their width .",
    "after one ( @xmath70 ) active - step we get one gap of width @xmath71 ; after two active - steps we obtain three gaps : one of width @xmath71 , and two gaps , each of width @xmath72 ; for @xmath73 , we have a total of 7 gaps , three just like in the @xmath74 case and 4 new members each of width @xmath75 - 2\\sigma$ ] , etc .",
    "an important observation is that if gaps appear at a certain level of the hierarchy , there always will be gaps of precisely the same width and position in the unit square at any later time : during the next active - step , a particular gap will _ map _ precisely down into the location of two other gaps of the given level . the largest gap ( the top level of the hierarchy ) is always located in between the points @xmath76 and @xmath77 . during the next active - step this particular gap",
    "is mapped into two lower level gaps , however its original position and width is taken over by the _ new _",
    "gap appearing as the images of the edges at @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the unit square , and modified by @xmath3 due to the reaction .",
    "thus the hierarchy being formed can be described as follows .",
    "after @xmath12 active - steps , there will be gaps of type @xmath12 ( i.e. , the hierarchy will have @xmath12 levels ) .",
    "if @xmath80 denotes the width of a gap on level @xmath81 , and @xmath82 denotes their number ( or multiplicity ) , then one can write : @xmath83 observe that the first term on the rhs of the first equation is exactly the width of the gaps in the reaction free baker map ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the second represents the total amount of area - decrease of each gap in @xmath81 reaction steps : @xmath84 .",
    "the total area occupied by the gaps ( or material @xmath1 ) after @xmath12 active - steps is given by @xmath85 the area occupied by material @xmath2 is simply the complementer of the above in the unit square : @xmath86 when @xmath87 , @xmath88 becomes negative , and later both areas formally diverge which indicates that this process has to stop after a finite number of steps .",
    "this happens by the closing of the smallest gaps due to the reactions in the @xmath89-th step : no further gaps can be created from a certain level down in the hierarchy because the reactions are of non - zero , finite width @xmath3 . by definition ,",
    "the thinnest gaps of an @xmath12-level hierarchy are the gaps at the lowest ( @xmath12-th ) level of width @xmath90 .",
    "the condition for the lowest level to be filled in @xmath89 active - steps is @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "from this , and eq .",
    "[ gaps ] , we obtain @xmath93 + 1\\ ; ,    & \\mbox{if}\\;\\ ; u \\;\\;\\mbox{is non - integer}\\;,\\\\ u\\ ; , & \\mbox{if}\\;\\ ; u \\;\\;\\mbox{is an integer}\\ ; , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{tt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath94 ( @xmath95 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath43 ) . for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and there are no more gaps at and below this level .",
    "thus , even if the active - steps are repeated indefinitely , the hierarchy of gaps stops at @xmath98 . since the gaps at higher level map into gaps at lower level , a steady state",
    "is reached after @xmath89 steps , and the whole material distribution becomes stationary .",
    "the fact that a stationary state is reached as a balance between the emptying dynamics and the reactions was numerically observed in all the previously studied dynamical systems ( e.g. , flow in the wake of a cylindrical obstacle ) @xcite , corroborating the generic character of the stationary state .      in this case",
    "there are @xmath4 baker - steps taken before an instantaneous reaction occurs .",
    "let us describe the hierarchy of gaps built up during @xmath12 active - steps .",
    "after the first @xmath4 baker - steps we obtain the usual reaction - free baker hierarchy with @xmath4 different types of gaps ( a total of @xmath99 gaps ) .",
    "after the first reaction there will be therefore @xmath100 gaps of type @xmath101 whose width is @xmath102 with @xmath103 . following the next active - step , one obtains @xmath104 types of gaps .",
    "the first @xmath4 types of gaps are generated by the @xmath101 times iterated images of the endpoints @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath103 ) and modified by the reaction .",
    "these have multiplicities widths and positions exactly as those after the first active - step .",
    "the second @xmath4 types of gaps are @xmath4 times iterated images of the gaps coming from the first active - step .",
    "the widths and multiplicities of this second set are given by @xmath105 , and @xmath106 on each level @xmath107 .",
    "in general , if we perform @xmath12 active - steps , there will be a total of @xmath108 gaps generated with the following widths and multiplicities : @xmath109 where @xmath107 and @xmath110 .",
    "analogously to the @xmath63 case , during the iteration , the gap - hierarchy changes by the _ addition _ of finer gaps , and the previously created gap - structure is _ not modified _ by the new reaction .",
    "however , in contrast to the @xmath63 case the new gaps resulted from the new reaction form a _ sub - hierarchy _ of @xmath4 levels . in the expressions ( [ taurecursion ] ) @xmath81 denotes the main levels of the hierarchy ( related to the state just after a reaction ) while @xmath101 quantifies the hierarchy on the subtree level ( created by the in - between - reactions baker - steps ) .",
    "recursion ( [ taurecursion ] ) is solved easily , and the result is : @xmath111 obviously the widths are decreasing functions of both @xmath81 and @xmath101 ( down the hierarchy ) as also seen from ( [ tausol ] ) .",
    "therefore , after @xmath12 active - steps the thinnest gaps will have the width of @xmath112 and multiplicity of @xmath113 .",
    "another important consequence of the monotonic behaviour is that the widths found within a level @xmath81 are _ all _ smaller than the widths found within the level @xmath114 .",
    "this statement is easily proven by comparing the thinnest and thickest gaps of the neighboring levels .",
    "thus , the total area of material @xmath1 after @xmath12 active - steps is computed as : @xmath115 for @xmath63 we indeed recover eq .",
    "( [ gaparea ] )",
    ". the total amount of material @xmath2 left in the system will again be the complementary of ( [ atau ] ) in the unit square , i.e. , @xmath116 : @xmath117 as @xmath12 ( time ) increases , there will be a critical @xmath118 value at which gaps start to disappear for the first time . of course , eq .",
    "( [ btau ] ) is valid only in the regime where no gaps have been filled yet .",
    "this means that for @xmath119 all the gaps of the hierarchy ( [ tausol ] ) exist , but for @xmath120 _ some _ of the gaps have disappeared .",
    "let us calculate this value and see how a stationary state is reached .",
    "since the thinnest gaps of width @xmath121 must have disappeared at @xmath120 ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) , but they were present at @xmath119 ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) , @xmath89 is calculated as @xmath93 + 1\\ ; ,    & \\mbox{if}\\;\\ ; u \\;\\;\\mbox{is non - integer}\\;,\\\\ u\\ ; , & \\mbox{if}\\;\\ ; u \\;\\;\\mbox{is an integer}\\ ; , \\end{array } \\right",

    "however , it is not necessary that only the thinnest gaps of @xmath89 have been filled . in principle , all the gaps of level @xmath89 can be filled because , as observed above , the widths of gaps at a higher level are _ all _ larger than those of a lower level .",

    "this leads to different geometrical factors for the areas and for the stripe widths .",
    "in this section we slightly modify the baker map .",
    "one reason to do so is to check whether the results obtained so far are robust enough .",
    "we show that only the geometrical factor is altered in this case , the main results obtained in the introduction and in refs .",
    "@xcite are the same .",
    "the other reason why another form of the baker map is introduced is based on the observation that during the reactions there is material hanging over the vertical edges ( the edges parallel to the background flow ) of the unit square .",
    "the behaviour of this material is not described by the baker map in the form of ( [ bakerorig ] ) .",
    "moreover , the cutting of these stripes hanging over the unit square is quite unnatural in terms of hydrodynamics : there is enough space for the growing of material across the background flow , the growth is usually not limited by such a sharp obstacle as the edge of the unit square .",
    "the modified baker map differs from ( [ bakerorig ] ) in the location of the fixed points around which the compression takes place .",
    "it consists of two steps : 1 ) the lower and upper half of the unit square is compressed in the @xmath43 direction by a factor of @xmath44 around the fixed point in @xmath227 and @xmath228 , respectively , where @xmath229 is a parameter chosen appropriately , and then 2 ) the compressed stripes are stretched along the @xmath47 direction ( around the same fixed points ) by a factor of @xmath230 . in other words , after one baker - step we get two vertical ( parallel to the @xmath47 axis ) stripes centered around @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "their centers are at a distance of @xmath229 .",
    "it can be chosen such that the stripes do not reach the vertical edges of the unit square , thus there remains enough space for the reactions .",
    "an appropriate choice is , e.g. , @xmath233 .",
    "the price for this modification is a more involved algebra . in this case , after each baker - step there are empty areas ( i.e. , covered by material @xmath1 ) inside the stripes of width @xmath69 , into which the unit square is mapped .",
    "this means that the gaps are wider than in the former derivation , and their calculation is not trivial .",
    "in fact , it is more convenient to follow the distance of the centers of the neighbouring stripes . in a baker - step ,",
    "all existing central distances are multiplied by @xmath69 , and a new level of the hierarchy is introduced .",
    "this hierarchy changes only if there are gaps disappearing .",
    "note that the stripe dynamics of the areas covered by material @xmath2 is much simpler than in the former baker model : all stripes of material @xmath2 have equal widths . without going into details ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained with this modified baker model for the steady state areas .",
    "first let us introduce @xmath234 this is a critical value of the reaction distance for any choice of @xmath69 and @xmath229 ; if @xmath235 then there is material @xmath2 hanging over the vertical edges of the unit square in the steady state . for @xmath236 ,",

    "the geometrical factor depends mainly on parameter @xmath69 of the baker map , as from ( [ eq : sigcr ] ) and ( [ eq : nsol ] ) we obtain the bounds @xmath242    the total area covered by material @xmath2 is @xmath243 this is , again , in coincidence with that obtained in eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite , but the geometrical factor is different from ( [ eq : del ] ) , it is @xmath244 the deviation between @xmath245 and @xmath246 is again the result of the extension of the fractal scaling to the range of @xmath226 , to the steady state stripe width .",
    "= 5.8 in    in figure [ fig : thegees ] we compare the four geometrical factors ( [ ge ] ) ( solid line ) and ( [ gbar ] ) ( dotted line ) , and ( [ geeps ] ) ( dashed line ) , ( [ eq : del ] ) ( dashed - dotted line ) as function of @xmath69 . although the average trend of the curves is the same , there are large deviations due to the fact that @xmath223 and @xmath246 are discontinuous functions .",
    "the deviations , however are less pronounced in the scaling region where the fractal structures of the maps are better resolved .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the geometric factor strongly depends on the particular realizations and relative positions of the filaments even when these realizations share the same fractal and dynamical properties ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of a fractal geometric catalyst supplied e.g.  by the langrangian dynamics of an underlying flow on the reaction kinetics of autocatalytic reactants transported in this flow .",
    "the reactive particles were assumed to simply follow the local velocity of the fluid element at their position and act as simple passive tracers that do not modify the properties of the flow .",
    "for mixing dynamics we have considered the simplest possible dynamics , namely two variants of the baker map , in order to be able to generate an analytic description of the reaction process . even though the baker map is the simplest map with chaotic mixing ,",
    "when reactions are superimposed on the transport dynamics , the analytical calculations become involved since the reaction range @xmath3 introduces a _ finite nonscaling cutoff _ which breaks the strict selfsimilarity . in the limit of slow reactions",
    "one is able to recover from these exact formulas the heuristic expressions derived for general flows , thus validating the latter approach , and showing that indeed , the fractal backbone does enhance the productivity of reactions , and acts as a fractal catalyst .",
    "= 5.8 in    a crucial point in the consistency between the heuristic and exact approach is played by the so - called geometrical factor @xmath32 ( or its variants @xmath247 ) . by definition",
    ", it should be a parameter reflecting mainly the geometrical properties of the mixing dynamics ( of the hydrodynamical flow ) .",
    "in the heuristic theory it is postulated to be independent of the chemistry parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the consistency is achieved by showing that it is only _ weakly _ depending on these parameters , in the scaling limit at least .",
    "this property follows from the close bounds ( [ bounds ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) on the geometrical factor(s ) depending on @xmath69 only .",
    "a direct plot of the geometrical factors as a function of the reaction range @xmath3 ( figure 8) also supports this property and suggests a weak , approximately periodic dependence on the logarithm of the reaction range , over several orders of magnitude .",
    "note , that the actual value of the geometrical factor strongly depends on the two independent global chaos parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) which determine the chemical kinematics ( see introduction ) , but might also depend on other aspects of the chaotic dynamics ( as e.g. , on the parameter @xmath229 of the modified baker map ) .",
    "various improvements and extensions to the present theory are possible : 1 ) one can consider @xcite the more realistic situation of non - simultaneous reactions , i.e. , the particles have a random phase dispersed among them .",
    "we expect that this only leads to a more rough , fluctuating @xmath248 interface along the manifolds , however these fluctuations are bounded due to the fact that only correlations of finite length can develop along the interface during the finite time lag @xmath4 , and thus it will renormalize the front velocity ; 2 ) the interacting particles ( which can be for example phytoplankton @xcite ) may locally modify the advection dynamics due to inertia and finite size effects . in this case",
    "the phase space of the problem increases in dimensionality by the number of velocity components of the particles since the latter no longer is the same as the fluid elements velocity ; 3 ) and at last but not the least , various other chemical reactions should be monitored , besides the autocatalytic ones presented here .",
    "finally , it is worth connecting the baker map results with the general description given in the introduction . to this order",
    ", we mention that in a map of linear extension @xmath11 , the reaction range is @xmath249 .",
    "analogously , the dimensional reaction time is @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the temporal period over which the baker map is acting .",
    "the reaction velocity @xmath252 is then @xmath253 taking the continuum limit of the reaction ( see introduction ) means that both the reaction range and time are short on the corresponding macroscopic scales .",
    "since @xmath11 is interpreted as a hydrodynamical length , this implies @xmath186 as used in the baker map . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath4 was taken to be of order unity , @xmath250 can only be short if the duration of the map is much _",
    "shorter than the characteristic hydrodynamical time_. even without further specifying the choice of @xmath251 , we can derive a useful condition in terms of a dimensionless number .    in the case of reactions in fluid flows with chaotic mixing properties we have three distinct levels of time - continuous dynamics built on top of each other :",

    "the reaction pclet number is much larger then unity .",
    "it is worth giving the definition of the traditional pclet number @xcite which measures the importance of _ diffusion _ relative to the flow : @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the charactersitic diffusion velocity .",
    "large @xmath268 implies weak diffusion . as suggested by the analogy between the traditional and the reaction pclet number , the reaction range plays a similar role as a diffusion length and the reaction velocity @xmath252 as @xmath269 .",
    "furthermore , if molecular diffusion is present but not very strong , it only renormalizes the reaction front velocity and all the formulas shown here are valid with @xmath252 replaced by an effective reaction front velocity @xcite .",
    "note that the direct reaction analog of the pclet number would be @xmath270 .",
    "it is worth pointing out however that instead we have @xmath271 which is rather a _",
    "lagrangian dynamics _ based quantity .",
    "the difference between @xmath272 and its hydrodynamical analog , @xmath273 , might be pronounced if the hydrodynamical and lyapunov times are not on the same order of magnitude .",
