    "<S> constant - pressure molecular - dynamics simulations of phospholipid membranes in the fluid @xmath0 phase reveal strong correlations between equilibrium fluctuations of volume and energy on the nanosecond time - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of strong volume - energy correlations was previously deduced indirectly by heimburg from experiments focusing on the phase transition between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 phases . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations , which are reported here for three different membranes ( dmpc , dmps - na , and dmpsh ) , have volume - energy correlation coefficients ranging from 0.81 to 0.89 . </S>",
    "<S> the dmpc membrane was studied at two temperatures showing that the correlation coefficient increases as the phase transition is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> biological membranes are essential parts of living cells . </S>",
    "<S> they not only act as passive barriers between outside and inside , but also play an active role in various biological mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the major constituent of biological membranes are phospholipids . </S>",
    "<S> pure phospholipid membranes often serve as a models for the more complex biological membranes . </S>",
    "<S> close to physiological temperatures membranes undergo a transition from the high - temperature fluid @xmath0 phase ( often referred to as the `` biologically relevant phase '' ) to a low - temperature ordered gel phase @xmath1 . in the melting regime response functions such as heat capacity , volume - expansion coefficient , and area - expansion coefficient increase dramatically . also , the characteristic time for the collective degrees of freedom increases and becomes longer than milliseconds . </S>",
    "<S> some time ago heimburg found that the slow , dominating parts of heat capacity and volume - expansion coefficient of dmpc as a function of temperature can be superimposed close to the melting temperature @xmath2 @xcite ( see also refs . 2 and 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the response functions are related in such a way that a single function describes the temperature dependence of both .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem connects ( linear ) response functions to equilibrium fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the isobaric heat capacity @xmath3 can be calculated from enthalpy fluctuations as follows : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an average in the constant temperature and pressure ensemble and @xmath6 is deviation from the average value . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , volume fluctuations are connected to the isothermal volume compressibility by the expression @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> if the response functions were described by a single parameter , fluctuations are also described by a single parameter @xcite and the microstates were connected via the relation @xmath8 . at constant pressure </S>",
    "<S> this relation applies if and only if @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is energy ) , which is the relation investigated below . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is referred to as a that of a single - parameter description @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a single - parameter description applies to a good approximation for several models of van der waals bonded liquids as well as for experimental super - critical argon @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , molecular - dynamics simulations are not possible for investigating `` single parameter''-ness of membranes close to @xmath2 , because the relaxation time for the collective modes by far exceeds possible simulation times . </S>",
    "<S> we show below , however , that a single - parameter description applies to a good approximation for the slow degrees of freedom of the fluid l@xmath11 phase , a description that applies better upon approaching @xmath2 . at the end of this note </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss how this property may be tested in experiments monitoring frequency - dependent thermoviscoelastic response functions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not _ a priori _ obvious that a single parameter may be sufficient for describing slow thermodynamic fluctuations of a membrane . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , simulations of water and methanol showed no `` single parameter''-ness . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , what happens here is that contributions to volume and energy fluctuations from hard - core repulsion compete with those from directional hydrogen bonds to destroy any significant correlation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> membranes are complex anisotropic systems , and we can not give any obvious reason that volume and energy should correlate strongly in their fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> a membrane may be pertubated via three thermodynamic energy bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the change of enthalpy @xmath12 can be written as a sum of contributions from a thermal energy bond , a mechanical volume energy bond , and a mechanical area energy bond , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is pressure , @xmath15 volume , @xmath16 membrane surface tension , and @xmath17 membrane area . </S>",
    "<S> the natural ensemble to consider is the constant @xmath18 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 ensemble , since the surrounding water acts as a reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> if a single parameter controls the microstates , for all states @xmath19 one would have @xmath20 where the @xmath21 s are constants . in general , the microstates may of course be controlled by several parameters . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question is how many parameters are sufficient to describe the membrane thermodynamics to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this question is addressed below by investigating molecular - dynamics simulations of different phospholipid membranes .    </S>",
    "<S> an overview of the simulated systems is found in table [ table1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated systems include different head groups ( both charged and zwitterions ) and temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations was carried out in the constant pressure , temperature ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the membranes are fully hydrated and in the fluid @xmath0 phase . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were performed using the program namd @xcite and a modified version of charmm27 all hydrogen parameter set @xcite . more simulation details are given in ref . </S>",

    "<S> similar results were found for the other membranes studied . </S>",
    "<S> table [ table1 ] shows that volume - energy correlation coefficients ( @xmath39 ) range between 0.81 and 0.89 .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation depends on the time scales considered . </S>",
    "<S> this can be investigated by evaluating @xmath31 where @xmath40 is a time correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 implies that energy at time @xmath42 is uncorrelated with volume at time @xmath43 , whereas @xmath44 close to unity implies strong correlation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is plotted in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pedersen:2 ] . at short time </S>",
    "<S> ( picoseconds ) @xmath32 is around 0.5 but approaches unity at @xmath33 ns .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` single - parameter''-ness between volume and energy is closely connected to the experimental findings of heimburg @xcite , since the slow ( collective ) degrees of freedom fluctuating on time scales larger than @xmath45 ns are those giving rise to the dramatic changes of the response functions approaching @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ pedersen:2 ] shows the time - correlation functions of energy , volume , and area of a dmpc membrane at 330 k and 310 k. time constant as well as magnitude of the slow fluctuations increase when temperature decreases and the phase transition is approached . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath47 @xmath48/j . </S>",
    "<S> this is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath49 @xmath48/j calculated from the experimental data of @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath2 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> both volume and energy time - correlation functions show a two - step relaxation at 310 k for dmpc ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pedersen:2]b ) . as temperature </S>",
    "<S> is lowered towards @xmath2 , the separation is expected to become more significant . </S>",
    "<S> it makes sense to divide the dynamics into two separated processes , a fast and a slow collective process . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations suggest that the slow degrees of freedom can be described by a single parameter , but not the fast degrees of freedom .    to see the `` single - parameter''-ness of the @xmath0 phase , the fast degrees of freedom must be filtered out </S>",
    "<S> . experiments deal with macroscopic samples where fluctuations are small and difficult to measure ( the relative magnitude of fluctuations goes as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of molecules ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore difficult in experiment to perform the same analysis as we have done here ; it is easier to measure response functions . </S>",
    "<S> fast fluctuations can be filtered out by measuring frequency - dependent response functions . </S>",
    "<S> the slow collective degrees of freedom give rise to a separate `` loss '' peaks in the imaginary parts . </S>",
    "<S> a frequency - dependent prigogine - defay ratio @xmath54 was recently suggested as a test quantity for single - parameter - ness in a paper focusing on the properties of glass - forming liquids @xcite . if @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the imaginary parts of the frequency - dependent isobaric specific heat ( per volume ) , isothermal compressibility , and isobaric expansion coefficient , respectively , by definition    @xmath58 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    in general @xmath59 , and @xmath60 if and only if a single parameter describes the fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath61 may be interpreted as a correlations coefficient .    in summary , we found strong volume - energy correlations of the slow degrees of freedom in molecular - dynamics simulations of different phospholipid membranes in the @xmath0 phase . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental test was suggested . </S>"
