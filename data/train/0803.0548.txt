    "one of the most important goals of observational cosmology has been to identify galaxies at the earliest times and to characterize their evolution . over the past few years",
    ", substantial progress has been made on this front , particularly at high redshifts ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "much of this progress has been due to the significant quantity of deep multi - wavelength data made possible by instruments like the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( ford et al .",
    "2003 ) or subaru s suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ) . as a result , current selections ( e.g. , yoshida et al .  2006 ; beckwith et al .  2006 ;",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "2007 ) now number in the tens of thousands of galaxies and reach to luminosities as faint as @xmath29 ab mag ( @xmath90.01 @xmath30 ) .",
    "this has enabled astronomers to measure a wide - range of properties in high - redshift galaxies and examine their evolution across cosmic time .",
    "one of the key observables considered in previous studies of high - redshift galaxies is the luminosity function in the rest - frame @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 lf is of significant interest not only because of the quantitative constraints it imposes on early galaxy formation , but also because of the information it provides on the star formation rate and @xmath1 output of galaxies at the earliest times .",
    "this latter information is important for investigating the role galaxies may have played in the reionization of the universe ( e.g. , stanway et al.2003 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004b ; yan & windhorst 2004 ; bouwens et al.2006 ) .    in principle",
    ", the large statistical samples of star - forming galaxies at @xmath28 just described allow us to determine the @xmath1 lfs and their evolution in great detail out to @xmath24 . unfortunately , despite the large sample sizes and wide luminosity ranges of current selections , there continues to be some uncertainty regarding how the @xmath1 lf evolves at very high redshift ( i.e. , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ) .",
    "some groups ( shimasaku et al .  2005 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2006 ; ouchi et al .  2004a ; bouwens et al .  2007 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) have argued the evolution occurs primarily at bright end of the lf , others ( iwata et al .",
    "2003 ; sawicki & thompson 2006 ; iwata et al .",
    "2007 ) have asserted it happens more at the faint - end , and still others have suggested the evolution is independent of luminosity ( beckwith et al .",
    "the diversity of conclusions drawn by different teams would seem to suggest that systematics are likely playing a large role . a careful discussion of this issue as well as detailed comparisons with contemporary determinations of the @xmath1 lf at @xmath28 can be found in bouwens et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "one way of gaining additional leverage in looking at the evolution of the @xmath1 lf at high redshift is to push to even higher redshift , i.e. , @xmath33 , to see what galaxies were like at these epoches .",
    "since it is expected that changes in the @xmath1 lf will be much more substantial over the interval @xmath33 to @xmath34 than from @xmath24 to @xmath23 , it should be relatively easy to ascertain how the @xmath1 lf is evolving at early cosmic times .",
    "the challenge , of course , is that the number of star - forming galaxy candidates at @xmath33 has been very small , of order @xmath35 galaxies ( bouwens et al .",

    ", the bulk of the effort has been directed towards simply establishing the overall prevalence of bright star - forming galaxies at @xmath33 ( bouwens et al .",

    "bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; mannucci et al .  2007 ; iye et al .  2006 ; stanway et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the present work",
    ", we will try to take studies of the @xmath1 lf at @xmath0 one step further and not just look at the overall prevalence of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 , but at how the volume density of these galaxies appears to vary as a function of luminosity .",
    "in doing so , we will attempt to derive constraints on the overall shape of the @xmath1 lf at @xmath0 and therefore evaluate different models for how the @xmath1 lf evolves with cosmic time .",
    "in particular , we are interested in looking at how the volume density of the bright population evolves and how this compares to the evolution of the faint population .",
    "if the mean luminosity of galaxies really does increase with time at early cosmic times , as one might expect from hierarchical models , the volume density of bright galaxies should evolve much more rapidly at @xmath0 than the volume density of the faint population .",
    "this change has been alternatively parametrized as a brightening of the characteristic luminosity @xmath15 with cosmic time ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ; yoshida et al .  2006 ; bouwens et al .  2007 ) or a flattening of the faint - end slope @xmath22 ( e.g. , yan & windhorst 2004 )",
    ".    to help with this endeavor",
    ", we will make use of the previous data used by our group in high - redshift ( @xmath33 ) galaxy searches ( e.g. , bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2005 ) and also take advantage of a significant amount of newer data . among these new data",
    "are deep acs observations over the nicmos parallels to the hudf ( oesch et al .",
    "2007 ) , a large number of moderately deep nicmos observations over the two goods fields ( h. teplitz et al .",
    "2008 , in prep ) , the deep wide - area isaac observations over the cdf - south goods field ( mannucci et al .  2007 ;",

    "vandame et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ; j. retzlaff et al .",

    "; ouchi et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we will also be taking advantage of improvements in our nicmos reduction techniques to push our previous selections slightly fainter .",
    "these new data ( particularly the new wide - area ground - based data ) will be crucial for examining the uv lf at @xmath0 over a wider range in luminosity than was possible in previous work ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2004c ; bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; mannucci et al .  2007 ; stanway et al .",
    "2008 ) , providing us with additional leverage to constrain the shape of the @xmath1 lf at @xmath36 .",
    "the ultra deep acs data over the nicmos parallels to the hudf will also allow us to increase both the depth and robustness of our searches for @xmath37 galaxies .",
    "we will organize this paper as follows . in  2 , we will provide a brief description of the observations we will use in this paper . in  3 , we will describe how we select our dropout samples from the imaging data and how we estimate the likely contamination levels . in  4",
    ", we will use these samples to derive the rest - frame @xmath1 lf at @xmath13 and set constraints on this lf at @xmath10 . finally ,",
    "in  5 , we discuss our results , and in  6 we will provide a summary of the main conclusions from this work and provide a short outlook for future progress . throughout this work , we will find it convenient to denote luminosities in terms of the characteristic luminosity @xmath38 at @xmath32 ( steidel et al .  1999 ) , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "where necessary , we assume @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . although these parameters are slightly different from those determined from the wmap five - year results ( dunkley et al .",
    "2008 ) , they allow for convenient comparison with other recent results expressed in a similar manner .",
    "our @xmath7 and @xmath11 dropout criteria select galaxies over a range in redshift ( i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath37 , respectively ) , with mean redshifts @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8=7.3 and @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8=9.0 , respectively ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "for succintness , we will usually refer to the redshift ranges selected by these dropout criteria as @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will express all magnitudes in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "a summary of the observational data used to search for @xmath0 @xmath7 and @xmath11 dropouts is provided in table  [ tab : obsdata ] .",
    "our deepest , wide - area constraint on the rest - frame @xmath1 lf at @xmath33 comes from the numerous hst nicmos nic3 fields which lie in and around the two goods fields .",
    "our reductions of the nicmos data over and around the goods fields ( including the hudf nicmos data ) was performed with the python package `` nicred.py '' ( magee et al .",
    "2007 ) and represent a slight update to the reductions we performed for the bouwens & illingworth ( 2006 ) work .",
    "the most important change in our reduction procedure is that we now include a correction for the non - linear response of the nic3 camera ( de jong et al .",
    "this has the effect of brightening the measured magnitudes in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands by @xmath47 and @xmath48 mag ( relative to what these magnitudes would be without the corrections ) .",
    "our reductions of the optical acs data are the same as those considered in our most recent work on the uv lf at @xmath28 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2007 ) and include essentially all primary and parallel acs data taken in the vicinity of the two goods fields ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .  2004a ; bouwens et al .  2004a ; riess et al .  2007",
    "; oesch et al .  2007 ) .",
    "our primary nicmos data set includes a somewhat larger number of search fields , some of significant depth , and better optical coverage than was used in our previous search for @xmath13 galaxies ( bouwens & illingworth 2006 : see figure 1 from the supplementary information ) .",
    "the most notable additions are ( 1 ) one ultra deep ( 28.1 ab mag at @xmath49 ) @xmath50 arcmin@xmath3 nic3 pointing within the area of the hudf ( oesch et al .  2007 ) , ( 2 ) ultra deep ( 28.7 ab mag at @xmath49 ) optical acs coverage over the second nicmos parallel to the hudf ( oesch et al .",
    "2007 ) , and ( 3 ) @xmath51 arcmin@xmath3 of additional deep ( 26.7 ab mag at @xmath49 ) nicmos data within the goods area ( riess et al .  2007 ; h. teplitz et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also made improvements to our reductions of the two deep nicmos fields taken in parallel to the hudf ( bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; oesch et al .",
    "2007 : see figure  [ fig : obsdata ] ) . reducing the nicmos data over these fields is challenging because of the small number of unique dither positions used in the acquisition of the data and the large number of individual frames ( @xmath52 frames in each field ) . as a result ,",
    "any systematics present in characterizing the properties of individual pixels on the nic3 detector propagate directly into the reduced frames , and therefore it becomes necessary to calibrate these properties sufficiently well so that systematics do not have a dramatic effect on the overall noise characteristics . to accomplish this",
    ", we generated super median images from a stack of all the nic3 frames taken over a field , subtracted this median image from each nic3 frame , and then redrizzled the individual frames together to produce a cleaner reduction . before generating the super median images , we mask out all sources identified in the @xmath53 image ( szalay et al .  1999 ) created from our initial reductions of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 band imaging data ; @xmath54 sources were masked per nic3 frame .",
    "we elected to use the @xmath53 image for this process to ensure that the same sources were masked in both the @xmath45 and @xmath46 frames .",
    "therefore , the colors of sources were not affected by this `` median stacking and subtraction '' procedure . to obtain the best possible reduction of the data , we repeated the above procedure several times : using each successive reduction of the data to better mask out the faint sources in the data , median stacking the masked frames , subtracting the medians from the individual frames , and then drizzling the data together to generate a cleaner `` final '' reduction .    in the dropout searches we performed over the nicmos data",
    ", we only included data which satisfied certain minimal depth requirements in both the optical and near - ir data to avoid the edges of the individual reductions where the number of individual frames contributing to any given pixel was small ( i.e. , where there might be concerns about some non - gaussian characteristics in the noise ) . in our @xmath13 @xmath55-dropout search , we only included areas where the @xmath55 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 depths were 27.5 ab mag , 26.8 ab mag , and 26.5 ab mag , respectively , over a 0.6@xmath56-diameter aperture ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we demanded greater depth for our @xmath45-band imaging data than we did for the @xmath46-band data given the importance of a robust detection in the @xmath45-band to making the case for an object being at @xmath0 .",
    "for our @xmath10 @xmath45-dropout search , we only included areas where the @xmath55 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46-band depths were 27.5 ab mag , 26.8 ab mag , and 26.8 ab mag , respectively , over a 0.6@xmath56-diameter aperture ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we set more stringent requirements on the @xmath46-band depths for our @xmath45 dropout search because of the greater need to use the @xmath46-band data to establish the reality of the sources . in total , the area of our search fields were @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 for our @xmath55-dropout selection and @xmath57 arcmin@xmath3 for our @xmath45-dropout selection .",

    "2006 ) , perhaps the best near - ir data set ( i.e. , deepest , widest area ) is from the subaru moircs imaging observations ( kajisawa et al .  2006 ; ouchi et al .  2007 )",
    "this is due to the significant investment of telescope time ( @xmath77 nights ) made by the moircs gto team in obtaining very deep @xmath78 images during march , april , and may of 2006 ( additional observations were made in march and april of 2007 but those are not yet public ) .",

    "nonetheless , we will briefly summarize the different steps in our processing here .",
    "all images were first psf - matched to the nicmos @xmath46-band data ( or @xmath11-band data in the case of our dropout searches over the isaac or moircs data ) .",
    "we then ran sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in double - image mode to perform the object detection and photometry .",
    "we generated the detection image by taking the square root of @xmath53 image ( szalay et al .",
    "1999 ) constructed from the @xmath45 and @xmath46 band images for our @xmath7-dropout selection and from the @xmath46 band image for our @xmath11-dropout selection .",
    "colors were measured in a small - scalable aperture using kron - style ( 1980 ) photometry , where the kron factor was 1.2 .",
    "these fluxes were then corrected up to total magnitudes using the light within a larger kron ( 1980 ) aperture ( adopting a kron factor of 2.5 ) .",
    "these latter corrections were made from the square root of the @xmath53 image to improve the s / n .",
    "figure 5 of coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) provides a graphical description of a similar multi - stage procedure for measuring colors and total magnitudes .",
    "aperture radii used for total magnitude measurements ranged from @xmath84 arcsec .",
    "an additional @xmath85 mag correction was made to account for the light outside of these apertures and on the wings of the psf ( e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "our selection criterion for our @xmath55-dropout search was @xmath86 as shown in figure  [ fig : zjjh ] , where @xmath87 represents the logical * and * operation .",
    "this criterion is identical to the `` less conservative '' @xmath7-dropout selection criterion of bouwens & illingworth ( 2006 ) .",
    "we opted to use this criterion rather the more stringent `` conservative '' criterion from that same work for two reasons .",
    "first , we realized that our `` conservative '' criterion may have been more stringent than necessary to reject contaminants like t - dwarfs ( low mass stars ) from our samples .",
    "these contaminants can ( in most cases ) be rejected by a procedure we will describe below .",
    "second , by adopting a `` less conservative '' selection criteria , the effective selection volumes will be larger and therefore less sensitive to small inaccuracies in the assumed model galaxy population .    for regions of the two goods fields with isaac / moircs coverage ,",
    "our @xmath7-dropout criterion was @xmath88 .",
    "this selection criterion is very similar to the criterion used over our nicmos fields . for the typical star - forming galaxy at @xmath13 ( with a @xmath1-continuum slope @xmath89 of @xmath90 ) this criterion selects galaxies to a slightly lower - redshift limit @xmath91 than our nicmos @xmath7-dropout criterion ( where @xmath92 ) .",
    "the criterion for our @xmath10 @xmath45-dropout search was @xmath93 .",
    "we elected to use a less restrictive @xmath94 color criterion than the @xmath95 criterion used in our previous @xmath11-dropout search ( bouwens et al .",
    "2005 ) because of the availability of deep optical data over almost all of our previous search fields to eliminate low redshift interlopers .",
    "previously ultra deep optical data were not available over the nicmos parallels to the hudf , and so we accordingly decided to select @xmath7 dropouts using a more stringent @xmath96 color cut .    in computing the @xmath97 and @xmath96 colors that we used for our @xmath7 and @xmath11 dropout selections , we set the @xmath7- and @xmath11-band fluxes to their @xmath20 upper limits in the case of non - detections .",
    "this was to minimize the extent to which faint sources in our search fields would scatter into our dropout samples .",
    "sources in our @xmath7 and @xmath11-dropout selections were also required to be detected at the @xmath98 level in the @xmath46 band within a 0.6@xmath56 diameter aperture ( to eliminate spurious sources ) and undetected ( @xmath99 ) in the available @xmath100 , @xmath101 , or @xmath102 band imaging .",
    "sources which were detected at the @xmath103 level in more than one of the acs @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 bands were also rejected as low - redshift interlopers .",
    "possible contamination by low mass stars ( which are a concern for our @xmath7-dropout selection ) are identified by looking for sources which showed faint detections ( @xmath104 ) in the @xmath55-band in a @xmath105-diameter aperture and whose @xmath55-band profile appeared to be consistent with a point source ( i.e. , the sextractor stellarity parameter @xmath106 ) .",
    "all candidate dropouts were inspected in the available irac and mips coverage over the two goods fields ( dickinson & goods team 2004 ) to ensure that none had particularly red @xmath107 mag or @xmath108 mag colors . with the exception of the two sources which satisfy our @xmath11-dropout criterion ( 03:32:41.22 , @xmath109:44:00.8 and 03:32:32.45 , @xmath109:42:21.5 ) , none of the sources which satisfied our other criteria were found to have such red infrared colors ( or showed significant detections at @xmath110 , @xmath111 , or @xmath112 ) .",
    "the two particularly red @xmath45 dropouts ( with @xmath46 magnitudes of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively ) have @xmath115 $ ] colors of @xmath116 mag and are even detected at @xmath112 in the available mips imaging over the goods fields ( meaning that their apparent magnitudes at @xmath112 m are @xmath117 mag ) .",
    "since we do not expect galaxies at @xmath0 to be so bright at @xmath112 and otherwise so highly reddened ( but see also discussion in wiklind et al .",

    "since t dwarfs occupy a position in color - color space very similar to that of high - redshift galaxies ( figure  [ fig : zjjh ] ) , they can therefore be difficult to distinguish from star - forming galaxies at @xmath13 on the basis their photometry alone .",
    "this leaves us with the size or morphology of these sources as essentially our only means of distinguishing these sources from @xmath13 galaxies .",

    "we set up the input population as follows : ( 1 ) the input @xmath174 magnitudes and photometric errors are modelled using the actual distribution of magnitudes and errors found in the data ( to make our estimates as model independent as possible and because essentially all faint sources in our fields will be at @xmath175 ) and ( 2 ) the colors ( i.e. , optical-@xmath46 and @xmath176 ) of the input population are assumed to be distributed in the same way as is observed for galaxies in the range @xmath177 in the hudf ( acs+nicmos coverage ) .",

    "based upon the described input population , we ran 10 separate photometric scattering experiments for each search field .",

    "however , in both cases , we are attempting to improve the detection significance ( as well as the s / n of the @xmath97 and @xmath96 colors ) by obtaining an additional 9 - 12 orbits of @xmath45-band data on both sources ( likely improving their detection significance to the @xmath98 level ) .    in summary ,",

    "classically , this cut - off has been explained as a result of the inefficiency with which gas can cool in halos above @xmath325 @xmath326 ( e.g. , binney 1977 ; rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk 1977 ) and settle out of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this explanation has recently been updated and recast in terms of a discussion of hot and cold flows ( i.e. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ; dekel & birnboim 2004 ) .",
    "the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the lf has also been explained as a result of agn feedback ( e.g. , binney 2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; granato et al.2004 ) , which above a certain mass scale is thought to cut off the flow of cold gas to a galaxy and therefore stop star formation .",
    "one final factor which may be important for imparting the sharp cut - off at the bright end of the lf , particularly at @xmath1 wavelengths , is dust obscuration , which becomes substantial ( factors @xmath343 ) for the most luminous systems ( e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ) . as a result",
    ", the @xmath1 luminosity of star - forming galaxies does not tend to reach above some maximum value ( see discussion in e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2000 ; martin el al .",
    "2005 ) .    at very high redshifts , where the typical halo masses are smaller",
    ", none of the above mechanisms would seem to work very well .",
    "the typical masses are below those where agn feedback might be expected to be important ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ; dekel & birnboim 2004 ) or where gas cooling is inefficient ( i.e. @xmath344 : dekel & birnboim 2004 ) .",
    "gas cooling will occur very efficiently in some regions of high mass ( @xmath345 ) halos through `` cold flows . '' ] the expected star - formation rates at these redshifts would also tend to be much lower and therefore dust obscuration would not likely be such an important factor either ( given the correlation between these two quantities : e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "as such , it would seem that there are no obvious mechanisms to impose an abrupt cut - off at the bright end of the @xmath1 lf and therefore we might expect that the uv lfs at very early times ( @xmath31 ) to lack the `` knee '' so characteristic of the schechter parametrization and look much more like the mass function .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 lfs at @xmath208 derived from a number of recent theoretical simulations ( e.g. , figure 7 of finlator et al .  2006 ;",
    "figure 10 of oesch et al .",
    "2007 ) have exactly those characteristics . those predicted lfs bear a much closer resemblance to power laws than they do to the traditional schechter function .",
    "the observation of a significant knee  or cut - off  at the bright end of the observed lfs out to @xmath24 may mean that there is some additional physics relevant to the formation of galaxies that is not fully understood .",
    "_ conditional luminosity functions : _ to illustrate this issue quantitatively , we adopt a simplified version of the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) formalism laid out in cooray & ouchi ( 2006 : see also yang et al .  2003 ;",
    "cooray & milosavljevi 2005 ) .",
    "the clf formalism provides us with a way of converting some halo mass function to a lf .",
    "typically there is a kernel which when convolved with the mass function gives the lf , i.e. , @xmath346 where @xmath347 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2 } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath348 is the sheth - tormen ( 1999 ) mass function , where @xmath349 , where @xmath350 gives the @xmath1 luminosity of the central galaxy in some halo of mass @xmath351 and where the parameter @xmath352 expresses the dispersion in the relationship between the halo mass and the @xmath1 light of the central galaxy .",
    "note that we have ignored the contribution from satellite galaxies to the luminosity function in the above equation since they appear to constitute @xmath315% of the galaxies over a wide - range in luminosity ( see , e.g. , cooray & ouchi 2006 ) .",
    "one aspect about the clf formalism is that it is largely independent of much of the normal phenomenology associated with galaxy formation and therefore it is very clean .",
    "there is no attempt to explicitly model the large number of physical processes likely to be important in the formation and evolution of galaxies ( which remain a challenge for most semi - analytic prescriptions , e.g. , somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .    making use of the above formalism , we experimented with a variety of different parameterizations to find a function @xmath350 and parameters @xmath352 and @xmath353 which reproduced the bouwens et al.(2007 ) @xmath1 lf at @xmath23 .",
    "we found that @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 worked reasonably well ( see the blue dashed line in figure  [ fig : clf ] ) .",
    "@xmath357 is equivalent to @xmath358 ab mag .",

    "our choice of @xmath353 set the mass scale where the exponential cut - off in the luminosity function takes effect . at the high mass end of the mass function , our equation for @xmath365 asymptotes towards a @xmath366 behavior .",
    "the physical motivation for this cut - off at the bright - end of the mass function would presumably be the same as at low redshift , where star formation is not as efficient for the most massive halos because of inefficient gas cooling or agn feedback . to show the effect the high mass cutoff has on the model lf",
    ", we also show this lf without such a cut - off ( see the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : clf ] ) . at the low - mass end , our equation for @xmath365 aymptotes towards a @xmath367 behavior .",
    "this allowed us to account for the fact that the faint - end slope of the @xmath1 lf is slightly shallower than that of the mass function ( i.e. , @xmath368 vs. @xmath269 ) .",

    "the question now is whether the above relationship between @xmath1 light and halo mass ( i.e. , the kernel @xmath369 ) can reproduce the rest - frame @xmath1 lf at @xmath208 . given the reasonable agreement between the observed evolution in @xmath15 and that predicted from the halo mass function assuming @xmath26 in the mass - to - light ratio , one might expect that the above kernel may work if we multiply the @xmath350 expression above to include the factor @xmath370 . with this change",

    "the uv lfs we predict at @xmath182 , @xmath24 , @xmath13 , and @xmath10 are presented in figure  [ fig : clf ] as the green , red , magenta , and black dashed lines , respectively .",
    "these lfs appear to differ somewhat in overall shape from what is found in our observations , predicting somewhat fewer galaxies at fainter luminosities than are observed , particularly near the `` knee '' of the lf ( i.e. , at @xmath372 ab mag ) .",
    "most notably , the sharp jump in the volume densities of sources observed between the bright end of the lf ( i.e. , @xmath373 ab mag ) and the `` knee '' of the lf ( i.e. , @xmath374 ab mag ) is not well matched by the predicted lfs at @xmath31 .",
    "this effectively illustrates what we were describing above . to obtain a lf with a prominent `` knee , ''",
    "we require some physical mechanism which will truncate the lf above some luminosity ( or mass ) . since this `` knee '' of the lf would seem to shift to much fainter luminosities at early cosmic times ( assuming that the evolution of the @xmath1 lf can be effectively parametrized in terms of @xmath15 to @xmath10 as suggested by figure  [ fig : abmagz ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : empfit ] ) , this mechanism needs to become important at progressively lower luminosities ( and also lower masses ) , as we move back in cosmic time .",
    "this is in contrast to the assumptions we use in the formalism above , where we have assumed that the mass cut - off @xmath353 is independent of cosmic time .",
    "it is not clear that any of the mechanisms proposed to produce a cut - off at the bright end of the lf ( e.g. , agn feedback , dust extinction , inefficient gas cooling at high masses ) will extend to very low luminosities ( or masses ) .",
    "the observations may therefore present us with a bit of puzzle .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible given the observational uncertainties that the @xmath1 lfs at @xmath0 will increasingly look like the halo mass function and less like a schechter function with a prominent `` knee . ''",

    "we assumed poissonian statistics in computing the likelihood of various model lfs (  4 ) .",
    "our decision to adopt a poissonian model in computing these likelihoods rather utilizing a more conventional approach like swml was to take advantage of the substantial amount of deep , wide - area near - ir imaging ( e.g. , the isaac or moircs data ) we have to constrain the @xmath1 lf at @xmath13 .",
    "since most of these imaging data contain no @xmath13 candidates , we would not be able to use that data for improving our determination of the @xmath1 lf at @xmath13 , had we chosen to use the conventional swml or sty79 techniques .",
    "however , modelling our observational results using poissonian statistics ( and assuming no large - scale structure variations ) , we are able to take advantage of this information to constrain the shape of the @xmath1 lf .    of course",
    ", in modelling the observational results using this approach , we are inherently assuming that the volume density of high - redshift star - forming galaxies is statistically homogeneous across the sky .",
    "in reality , however , the distribution of galaxies is modestly clustered , and therefore the mean volume density of galaxies will show significant variations as a function of position . these variations in the mean density occur as a result of large - scale structure and will have an effect on the best - fit @xmath1 lf we derive at @xmath13 , scattering it away from the cosmic average .    to estimate the effect that such variations will have on our fit results , we ran a set of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we varied the surface density of model dropouts in each of our search fields by @xmath389% rms ( see  4.1 ) and then recomputed the @xmath1 lf in the same way as in  4.2 .",
    "we found @xmath20 variations of @xmath390 mag in the values of @xmath15 and @xmath15030% in the values of @xmath16 at @xmath13 . adding these uncertainties in quadrature with those deriving from poissonian uncertainties (  4.2 ) ,",

    "the effect of large - scale structure variations on the constraints we place on the @xmath1 lf at @xmath10 is much smaller in general . given that we have no sources in our @xmath11-dropout sample , the poissonian uncertainties ( @xmath392% ) dominate over the expected field - to - field variations , which are @xmath393% ( see  4.2 or bouwens et al .",
    "besides small number statistics , perhaps the biggest uncertainty in the present determination of the rest - frame @xmath1 lf at @xmath0 is in our estimates of the selection volumes for the two dropout samples .",
    "we derived these estimates using the following model for the sizes , morphologies , and @xmath1 colors of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we assumed that star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 have similar pixel - by - pixel profiles to the @xmath23 @xmath183-dropouts in the hudf , but with physical sizes scaled by a factor of @xmath193 ( e.g. , at @xmath13 galaxies of a given luminosity have approximately half the physical size of star - forming galaxies at @xmath23 and therefore four times the surface brightness ) .",
    "the @xmath1-continuum slopes @xmath89 were taken to have a mean of @xmath269 and @xmath20 scatter of 0.5 .",

    "we begin by comparing the observed @xmath96 colors of @xmath7-dropouts in our sample with that predicted using our best - fit lf ( @xmath394 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath395 mag , @xmath396 ) and the model we just described above ( see also  4 ) for calculating the selection volumes .",
    "we include the comparison in the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "similarly , we can compare the half - light radii of @xmath7-dropouts in our sample with that predicted from our models . to ensure that the size distribution we derive for @xmath7-dropouts is not dominated by surface brightness selection effects ( which only allows for the selection of point - like sources near the magnitude limit ) , we only consider the sizes of @xmath7-dropouts that are @xmath397 mag brighter than the magnitude limit .",

    "what is the reason for these substantial differences ?",
    "while one possible explanation could be `` cosmic variance '' ( i.e. , field - to - field variations ) , simple estimates for the variance one expects in the volume density of high - redshift sources behind a typical cluster is of order @xmath950% rms , and therefore much smaller than the factor of @xmath343 differences seen here .",
