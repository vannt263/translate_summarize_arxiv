    "immediately with the emergence of quantum information science ( qis ) , entanglement was recognized as the key resource for many tasks such as teleportation , super dense coding and more recently measurement based quantum computation ( for review , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this recognition sparked an enormous stream of work in an effort to quantify entanglement in both bipartite and multipartite settings . despite the huge effort , except the negativity  @xcite ( and the logarithmic negativity  @xcite ) closed formulas for the calculation of different measures of entanglement exist only in two qubits systems and , to our knowledge , only for the entanglement of formation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the discovery that several measures of entanglement and quantum channel capacities are not additive  @xcite , made it clear that formulas in lower dimensional systems , in general , can not be used to determine the asymptotic rates of different quantum information tasks .",
    "hence , formulas in higher dimensional systems are quite essential for the development of qis .    among the different measures of entanglement ,",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) is of a particular importance .",
    "the ree is defined by  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of separable states or positive partial transpose ( ppt ) states , and @xmath2 .",
    "it quantifies to what extent a given state can be operationally distinguished from the closest state which is either separable or has a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) .",
    "besides of being an entanglement monotone it also has nice properties such as being asymptotically continuous .",
    "the importance of the ree comes from the fact that its asymptotic version provides the unique rate for reversible transformations  @xcite .",
    "this property was demonstrated recently with the discovery that the regularized ree is the unique function that quantify the rate of interconversion between states in a reversible theory of entanglement , where all types of non - entangling operations are allowed  @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) is called the closest separable state ( css ) or the closest ppt state . recently",
    ", the inverse problem to the long standing problem  @xcite of finding the formula for the css @xmath4 was solved in  @xcite for the case of two qubits . in  @xcite",
    "the authors found a closed formula for the inverse problem .",
    "that is , for a given state @xmath5 on the boundary of 2-qubits separable states , @xmath6 , the authors found an explicit formula describing all entangled states for which @xmath7 is the css .",
    "quite astonishingly , we show here that this inverse problem can be solved analytically not only for the case of two qubits , but in fact in all dimensions and for any number of parties .",
    "we now describe briefly this formula .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the hilbert space of @xmath9 hermitian matrices , where the inner product of @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "denote by @xmath12 the convex set of positive hermitian matrices of trace one , and the cone of positive hermitian matrices , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 so that the multi - partite density matrix @xmath14 can be viewed as acting on the @xmath15-parties hilbert space @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath7 is full rank ) .",
    "then for any @xmath18 and a small real @xmath19 we have the taylor expansion of @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a self - adjoint operator ( defined in the next section ) , which is invertible , and satisfies @xmath22 .",
    "assume now that @xmath23 ( later we will extend the results for all @xmath24 ; i.e. not necessarily full rank ) .",
    "then , from the supporting hyperplane theorem , @xmath7 has at least one supporting hyperplane , @xmath25 , of the following form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is normalized ; i.e. @xmath28 . for each such @xmath27",
    ", we define the family of _ all _ entangled states , @xmath29 , for which @xmath7 is the css : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is defined such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 has at least one zero eigenvalue .",
    "we also note that @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , for the case of two qubits , @xmath27 is unique and is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the partial transpose , and @xmath37 is the unique normalized state that satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "hence , for the case of two qubits our formula is reduced to the one given in  @xcite , by recognizing that for this case , the self - adjoint operator @xmath39 is given by the function @xmath40 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the definition of @xmath41 . in section iii",
    "we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the css and in section iv we prove the main result for the case were the css is full rank .",
    "to illustrate how the formula can be applied , in section v we discuss the qubit - qudit @xmath42 case . in section",
    "vi we discuss how to apply the formula for tensor products . in section",

    "dividing by @xmath77 gives @xmath79 .",
    "this completes the necessary part of the proof since @xmath69 is self - adjoint .",
    "the sufficient part of the proof follows directly from the construction of @xmath29 in theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the proposition above leads to the following intuitive corollary :    let @xmath5 be a css of an entangled state @xmath80 .",
    "then , @xmath24 .",
    "assume that the css @xmath7 is an interior point of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath81 separable @xmath82 is separable for all small @xmath83 , where @xmath77 is either positive or negative .",
    "hence , instead of eq.([necmaxcon ] ) we get the identity @xmath84 for _ all _ separable states @xmath85 .",

    "now , since @xmath1 is a closed convex subset of @xmath93 it follows ( from the supporting hyperplane theorem ) that for each boundary point @xmath24 there exists a nonzero linear functional on @xmath94 , represented by @xmath25 , satisfying the following condition : @xmath95 note that the equation above holds true if @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath96 ( this is because @xmath97 ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath98 we can normalize it .",
    "therefore , there exists @xmath25 satisfying ( [ phisuphy ] ) and the normalization @xmath99 for most @xmath7 on the boundary @xmath6 , the supporting hyperplane of @xmath1 at @xmath7 is unique ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "if both @xmath7 and @xmath81 are css of @xmath80 , then both are full rank and we have @xmath126 .",

    "the boundary of the ppt states is simple to characterize .",
