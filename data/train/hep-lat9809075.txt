    "the @xmath0 improved action , as introduced by symanzik @xcite and proposed for lattices fermions by sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite has become a popular and relatively simple tool for improving lattice predictions over the last years .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate how different observables are affected by the @xmath0 improvement of the standard wilson action in a simple and well - known toy model .",
    "our testing ground is the 2-flavor schwinger model ( qed in 2d ) , which is well - known analytically and quite undemanding computationally .",
    "we perform a full fermion hmc simulation and study bosonic masses and dispersion relations , rotational invariance and the eigenvalue spectrum of the action .",
    "the sw action is obtained from the naive fermion action by a rotation of the fermionic fields @xmath1 and discarding the @xmath2 terms in the resulting action .",
    "this results in the wilson action plus an additional sw term @xmath3 the coefficient @xmath4 is @xmath5 for tree - level improvement and has to be determined perturbatively or non - perturbatively in 4d . in our case of the superrenormalizable schwinger model , the coupling @xmath6 has dimension @xmath7 , so that in a perturbative expansion , where the next - to - leading order graph has two vertices , @xmath8 . therefore for an @xmath0 improvement @xmath9 .",
    "first we looked at the phase diagram comparing wilson to sw action ( fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) .",
    "we determined @xmath10 at a given @xmath11 by pcac methods , i.e. measuring an observable , which is proportional to the effective fermion mass at five different values of @xmath12 and finding @xmath10 by interpolation ( for more details cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as expected ,",
    "the critical line moves closer to the continuum critical value of @xmath13 .",
    "however , we find that for both actions the leading correction goes like @xmath14 we found the volume dependence of @xmath10 to be weak ( see @xcite for a discussion for the wilson action )",
    ".      we also determined the eigenvalue spectrum of the fermion matrix for different configurations .",
    "as has been pointed out recently , the fixed point action @xcite as well as the overlap action @xcite have an eigenvalue spectrum of circular shape ; this is related to the fact that they satisfy the ginsparg - wilson condition @xcite and therefore have good chiral properties .    as can be seen in fig.[spec ]",
    ", the sw spectrum differs from the wilson spectrum ( see e.g.@xcite ) but does not improve much towards a circular shape .",
    "the change of the spectrum is consistent with the observations made in @xcite for 4d su(2 ) theory .",
    "another interesting aspect is , whether one may observe any improvement in the rotational invariance of propagators . for this purpose",
    ", we measured @xmath15 for all distances across the lattice and plotted the correlation function vs. @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the two fermion flavors ) . for a comparison , this",
    "was done at the same @xmath11 and for the same effective fermion mass for both actions .",
    "for the sw situation the fermion fields were also improved according to ( [ frot ] ) .",
    "although the propagator is an off - shell quantity one might expect some improvement , since we also improved the fermion fields .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ rot ] there is no noticeable improvement in the rotational invariance for short distances .",
    "this is our first indication , that also high momentum observables are not improved .",
    "the spectrum of the massless @xmath19-flavor schwinger model contains one free massive ( isosinglet - vector ) meson with mass @xmath20 and @xmath21 free massless ( isomultiplet - vector ) mesons .",
    "we measured the dispersion relation of both the massive and the massless bosons and found  compared to the results for the wilson action  no improvement ( fig.[disp0 ] ) .",
    "the higher momentum modes are clearly deviating from the continuum behavior .",
    "for the fixed point action drastically better behavior has been observed @xcite .",
    "for the massive boson one expects improved scaling ; indeed there seems to be evidence that the mass estimate at small @xmath11 is improved with the sw action .",
    "however , the statistics of our data does not allow conclusive statements at this point .",
    "we studied the effect of @xmath0 sw - improvement of the wilson action in the unquenched @xmath22-flavor lattice schwinger model .",
    "we found that the critical value of the hopping parameter @xmath10 moves closer to its continuum value @xmath23 .",
    "we observed a change in the eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator but we found no significant improvement towards e.g. a circular shape .",
    "we found no improvement in the rotational symmetry of correlation functions or in the dispersion relations at higher momentum .",
    "since it is well established from qcd simulations that meson masses are improved by using the sw action , we conclude that the @xmath24 sw - improvement works best for low momentum states and that there might be no relevant improvement for observables connected with higher momentum states ."
