    "hadron physics in the intermediate energy region ( i.e. , @xmath7gev ) is well known to be a difficult field of study , since neither pqcd nor chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is applicable there .",
    "especially the study on the property of light scalar mesons has a long history of controversy .",
    "dispersion technique is found to be powerful , in firmly establishing the existence of light scalar mesons such as @xmath6 , @xmath8 and in determining rather precisely their pole locations  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the property of the light scalar mesons ( @xmath5,@xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath11 ) remains somewhat mysterious .",
    "one commonly used method in the literature to attack this problem is the so called  inverse amplitude method  or ",
    "chiral unitarization approach  .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 couple channel system is extensively studied  @xcite-@xcite , giving the sheet ii trajectory of light mesons  @xcite-@xcite below 1gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is pointed out that a couple channel breit ",
    "wigner resonance should exhibit two poles on different riemann sheets and reach the same position on the real axis when @xmath1 . in this point of view  searching for accompanying shadow pole  is stressed which is overlooked by most previous studies .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the criteria is unaltered when changing parameters and hence avoids parameter dependence .",
    "the worry of being model ( pad approximation ) dependent is also , at least partly , avoided , since one can examine the pole structure of well known particles ( such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances ) to justify the validity of using pad approximation in studying analyticity property of the pole . in this paper",
    "we follow the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite and extend it to the situation with @xmath16 three channel system ( together with @xmath17 system when studying @xmath9 ) .",
    "we find that , with @xmath4 channel included , qualitative results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite remain valid .",
    "especially , it is found that the @xmath5 pole remains to be a single trajectory .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that a careless mistake occurs in ref .",
    "@xcite : the @xmath6 , @xmath8 were mistakenly claimed to have only single trajectory in two channel case . according to a careful re - analysis",
    ", they both contain a shadow pole on sheet iii  hence the @xmath6 , @xmath8 mesons are also of couple channel breit  wigner resonance origin .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief introduction to partial wave projection , analytical continuation , and pad unitarization . in section 3",
    "we fit the experimental phase shift and inelasticity to fix the low energy constants ( lecs ) and extract pole positions . in section 4",
    "we analyze the trajectory of the poles .",
    "the last section is for conclusion .",
    "the chpt scattering amplitudes have been given in  @xcite and the iso - spin decomposed formulas are given in  @xcite : the projection in definite angular momentum is given by @xmath18 where i is isospin , j denotes the total angular momentum . here",
    "@xmath19 for @xmath20 amplitudes , @xmath21 for @xmath22 amplitudes , and n=1 for other cases . from now",
    "on we omit the i , j index for simplicity .",
    "matrix pad approximation was derived to obtain unitarized amplitudes from the @xmath24 and @xmath25 chpt scattering amplitudes , which is equivalent to : @xmath26^{-1}\\cdot t^{(2)}\\ .\\ ] ] for a three channel case , the unitarized amplitudes satisfy such unitarity conditions , @xmath27 here the subscript 1 represents @xmath2 , 2 for @xmath3 , and 3 represents @xmath4 .",
    "the fourth equation only holds true above @xmath28  @xcite and the sixth equation only holds true above @xmath29 . the same as in couple channel",
    ", it violates unitarity as the left hand cut @xmath30 $ ] appears not only in @xmath31 , but also in the other five t matrix elements .    partial wave",
    "@xmath32 matrix elements are given by @xmath33 the @xmath34 s - matrix parametrization is given in the paper  @xcite : @xmath35      to extend the scattering amplitudes in the complex plane , we need analytic continuation .",
    "the multi - channel continuation has been given by the paper according to the cuts caused by phase space factor @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "here we use the following order of analytical continuation for simplicity : @xmath36 they generate the riemann sheets :    .[continuation]the definition of riemann sheets .

    "the pole locations when @xmath38 are presented in table  [ pole ] . for comparison",
    ", we also use these lecs to plot trajectories of @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the old scheme of ref .",

    "confined to simplified two channel situation , it is found that the trajectories of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath5 are qualitatively the same as our previous work  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that for @xmath8 and @xmath6 , a sheet iii pole overlooked in ref .",
    "@xcite was found .",
    "we find that these two poles satisfy the twin pole structure : poles in sheet ii , iii meet each other in the real axis when @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",

    "@xcite : the sheet ii pole moves into upper half plane of sheet v from the lower half of sheet ii in the @xmath59-plane , winding around the branch point at the @xmath60 threshold ( see fig .",

    "eventually it will fall down to the positive real axis , between @xmath2 and @xmath60 threshold , with @xmath61 shadow poles accompanied .",
    "the trajectory of @xmath6 in the triple channel study exhibits a clear quadruplet pole structure : there are four adjoint poles in sheet ii , iii , iv , vii , and they will meet each other in the negative real axis of the s complex plane when @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ nc]h ) ) .",
    "in this paper , we have made a rather sophisticated analysis on the analyticity structure of pad amplitudes , with ij=00 @xmath62 channels included .",
    "our`breit - wigner criteria ' previously proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to multi - channel case : a triple channel breit - wigner resonance should appear as quadruplet poles and meet each other on the real axis when @xmath63 .",
    "our analysis confirm that @xmath14 , @xmath15 are standard breit - wigner particles due to their stable twin pole structure . for @xmath9",
    "one needs more precise data to get a better pole location when @xmath38 and our analysis supports it to be a breit - wigner resonance .    for @xmath5 , we find that the qualitative picture and physical conclusion one can draw from this analysis is very similar to our previous results given in ref .",
    "it reveals that @xmath5 plays a very special role in the family of low lying scalar mesons : it is most likely of @xmath3 nature .",
    "the meaning of this paper is that we demonstrate such a distinguishing property of @xmath5 is stable against the number of thresholds it couples .",
    "we also corrected the results on @xmath6 and @xmath8 made in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we find that both @xmath6 and @xmath8 maintain a shadow pole structure , hence revealing their breit  wigner origin , even though they behave very oddly in reality and in the large @xmath37 world .",
    "nevertheless the similarities between two trajectories in sheet ii and sheet iii even when @xmath64 is not large suggests that they are dominantly single channel particles .",
