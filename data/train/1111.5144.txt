    "spin glass is an intriguing example of non - ergodic state marked by several physical properties such as thermomagnetic irreversibility , slow dynamics , non - exponential decay , magnetic memory effect , etc .",

    "capable of pining the spins .",
    "in recent time , spin glass like non - equilibrium dynamics and time dependent phenomena have been observed in several magnetic systems , where the basic building blocks responsible for the ` glassy ' behavior are not really the atomic spins , rather spin cluster or bigger spin entity .",
    "@xcite in particular , such behavior have been widely observed in phase separated manganites  @xcite and cobaltites .",
    "@xcite the observation of slow dynamics resembling classical spin glass is also extended to intermetallic alloys  @xcite showing first order magnetostructural transition and also to magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite since , the basic building blocks are bigger spin entity , they are often termed as cluster glass , superspin glass or magnetic glass .",
    "the coexisting magnetic phases related to glassyness in manganites and other bulk solids are often related to first order phase transition ( fopt ) .",
    "@xcite in presence of static disorder , fopt can lead to coexistence of high - temperature ( @xmath0 ) parent and low-@xmath0 product phases within the region of transition . in certain circumstances",
    ", there can also be structural freezing of the parent phase below the transition point .",
    "@xcite the glassyness in such phase separated system can have two likely origin .",
    "firstly , the slow dynamics of the coexisting phases due to their metastability , and secondly due to frustration arising from the magnetic interaction between two clusters having distinct magnetic nature .",
    "the spin glass like state ( or often called cluster glass ) in phase separated manganites has often been attributed to the coexisting ferromagnetic ( fm ) and charged order antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases of micrometer size due to fopt .",
    "@xcite it is worth noting that in case of polydispersive non - interacting nanoparticle system ( where the magnetic interaction between two particles is negligible ) , a simple model based on the distribution of superparamagnetic relaxation time can explain the observed glassy magnetic behavior including the memory effect .",
    "@xcite    considering the fact that a large number of bulk phase separated materials show glassy magnetic behavior , it is pertinent to investigate the role of inter - cluster magnetic interaction toward the observed state .",
    "however , unlike magnetic nanoparticles ,  @xcite one can not tune the strength of the magnetic interaction in a bulk material .",
    "more importantly , the fopt in such systems is of magneto - structural type with strong interplay between magnetic and structural degrees of freedom . as a result , the structural and the magnetic transitions occur below the same @xmath0 , and their individual role toward the glassyness becomes difficult to differentiate .",
    "here we report the magnetic investigation on gdcu intermetallic compound , which was reported to show phase coexistence due to first order martensitic transition ( mt ) .",
    "@xcite the fact that prompted us to investigate gdcu is that the magnetic and structural transitions occur at distinctly different @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it provides an opportunity to investigate the role of magnetic interaction and structural phase separation in determining the ground state magnetic character .",
    "the rcu ( r= rare - earth ) series of compounds with heavy rare - earth ( r @xmath1 gd ) crystallize in the cubic cscl - type structure ( hereafter called c - phase ) at high-@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite some of the members ( r = gd , tb and y ) show lattice instability and undergo mt at low @xmath0 to an orthorhombic feb - type structure ( hereafter called o - phase ) .",
    "gdcu shows long range afm ordering below @xmath2 in the c - phase , while it undergoes a second transition below @xmath3 to a helimagnetic ( hm ) spin structure in the low-@xmath0 o - phase .",
    "our investigation shows the existence of an unconventional glassy magnetic phase in gdcu below @xmath3 , which presumably arises out of the magnetic frustration from coexisting phases .",
    "polycrystalline samples of gdcu and dycu were prepared by argon arc melting with the constituent elements of purity better than 99.9 wt% .",
    "the ingots were homogenized at 800@xmath4c for 120 h. room temperature powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were recorded using a bruker axs diffractometer ( cu k@xmath5 radiation , 2@xmath6 range from 20@xmath7 to 80@xmath7 with a step size of 0.02@xmath7 and 5 s / step counting time ) .",

    "@xcite only a part of the thermal hysteresis loop associated with the mt is visible in the measured @xmath0 range , because the transition extends up to 650 k in the high-@xmath0 side .",
    "@xcite in the low-@xmath0 side , the loop closes at 140 k.  @xcite similar hysteresis is also present between the field - cooling ( fcc ) and subsequent field - cooled heating ( fch ) legs of the @xmath15 versus @xmath0 data ( fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , main panel ) .",
    "a small anomaly is observed both in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 near 145 k , which matches well with the afm transition temperature , @xmath2 of the austenitic c - phase reported earlier .",
    "@xcite a second magnetic anomaly is observed in @xmath16 and @xmath17 data around 45 k ( denoted by @xmath3 ) which indicates the onset of helical magnetic ordering of the martensitic o - phase present in the sample .",

    "a clear bifurcation is observed between zfch and fch magnetizations [ fig . 2 ( b ) ] below @xmath3 , signifying the existence of thermomagnetic irreversibility associated with the hm transition .",
    "the zfch magnetization drops with decreasing @xmath0 , while the fch counterpart shows a sluggish upturn .",
    "the feature in the @xmath18 curve near @xmath3 is found to be rather broad .",
    "such broad feature associated with thermomagnetic irreversibility can be an indication of disordered and/or glassy magnetic phase below @xmath3 .    the inset of fig .",
    "2 ( a ) shows the @xmath19 curve of gdcu measured at 4 k , which is found to be linear without any signature of field induced transition . the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 curves ( not shown here ) also do not show any signature of metamagnetism .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr = [ @xmath20/\\rho(0)$ ] ) at 4 k is found to be very small and positive ( about 4% for @xmath12 = 50 koe ) , which is common among bulk afm materials .",
    "@xcite therefore , one can rule out the possibility of any major role of @xmath12 in stabilizing different magnetic and structural phases in gdcu .",
    "this is possibly indicative of a weak magneto - structural coupling in gdcu unlike manganites  @xcite or magnetic shape memory alloys .",
    "@xcite      considering magnetic irreversibility in gdcu , the time ( @xmath21 ) evolution of @xmath13 was investigated at low @xmath0 .",
    "the measurement was performed in two protocols , namely zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) as described in figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath13 for both the protocols were measured under 100 oe of applied field [ figs . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the zfc measurement was performed at different temperatures above and below @xmath3 .",
    "however , only strong relaxation effect was observed below @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath22 data collected in the zfc mode at 30 k ( below @xmath3 ) shows 1% change in 3600 s , while at 60 k ( just above @xmath3 ) the change is only 0.1% .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath13 have been analyzed on the basis of various available models of slow dynamics applicable to magnetic system .",
    "it can often show a power law ( @xmath23 ) or a kohlrausch - williams - watt ( kww ) stretched exponential behavior ( @xmath24 $ ] )  @xcite where @xmath25 is the characteristic relaxation time and @xmath26 is the shape parameter .",
    "we have used both the relations to fit our data , and found that the best fit is obtained with the kww model .",
    "such model was widely used to analyze the data for spin glass and other disordered magnets .",
    "@xcite in this model , @xmath26 lies between 0 and 1 for different class of disordered materials .",
    "the value of @xmath26 was found to be 0.51 and 0.59 for the zfc and fc data respectively at 4 k. the exponent @xmath26 in the kww model signifies the number of intermediate states through which the system should evolve , and it approaches 1 when the number of such intermediate states diminishes .",
    "@xcite glassy magnetic systems are found to show @xmath26 values over a wide range between 0.2 to 0.6 below the freezing temperature ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "for example , the spin glass alloy la - fe - mn - si  @xcite has @xmath26 value close to 0.5 well below @xmath27 , while cumn ( 4.0 at % )  @xcite shows @xmath26 to be between 0.2 to 0.4 depending upon the temperature of measurement .    0.4 cm      we studied the aging effect in gdcu below @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "the sample was first zero -field cooled down to 15 k , and was allowed to age there for a certain waiting time of @xmath28 .",
    "subsequently @xmath13 was measured as a function of time in presence of @xmath12 = 100 oe .",
    "the measurement was performed for three different values of @xmath28 , namely 600 , 2000 and 5000 s. from the @xmath21 variation of @xmath13 in the resulting states , we have calculated the magnetic viscosity ( @xmath29 ) as shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath30 behavior is strongly influenced by the waiting time .",
    "the @xmath30 plots show clear peak at the respective @xmath28 values , which is typical experimental evidence of the non - equilibrium states in classical spin glass system .",
    "@xcite it is worth noting that such perfect match between @xmath28 and the peak position of @xmath30 in case of gdcu is absent in several glassy magnetic materials indicating a deviation from the classical spin glass behavior ( see for example .",
    "@xcite )      we probed the memory in dc magnetization in gdcu through different modes of measurements .",
    "@xcite first we depict the memory in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath13 measured in the fc state following the protocol by sun _",
    "_  @xcite ( see fig . 5 ( a ) ) .",
    "chronologically , the measurement was performed in the following steps : ( i ) the sample was cooled in @xmath12 = 100 oe from 100 k to 2 k with intermediate stops of duration @xmath28 = 1 h each at @xmath31 = 30 , 20 and 10 k. during each stop , @xmath0 was kept constant , while @xmath12 was reduced to zero . after each stop , we reapplied @xmath12 and resumed cooling , which resulted a step - like @xmath32 curve ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "( ii ) after reaching 2 k , the sample was heated back in @xmath12 = 100 oe , which produces the so called ` memory ' curves ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "( iii ) a reference curve was also recorded by simply allowing the sample to heat in @xmath12 = 100 oe after being field - cooled in the same field without any stop ( @xmath35 ) . the @xmath0 ramp rate in all the measurement ( as well as during field cooling )",
    "was kept fixed at 1 k / min . while heating ( curve @xmath34 in fig . 5 ( a ) ) , we observe striking memory effect signifying nonergodic behavior of the low-@xmath0 phase . at each @xmath31 ,",
    "the sample produces clear upturn revealing the previous history of stops in zero field at that @xmath0 .",
    "this is a manifestation of memory in the low-@xmath0 phase .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that _ no memory was observed above @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) _ , which once again proves the role of hm ordering for the observed arrested dynamics in gdcu .",
    "0.4 cm    we also looked for memory in dycu , which belongs to the same rcu series of compounds .",
    "however , unlike gdcu , dycu does not undergo mt and it remains in the c - phase down to low @xmath0 .",
    "dycu undergoes afm ordering below 63  k ,  @xcite and shows a second magnetic transition below 20 k. we performed the same memory experiment on dycu , and no signature of magnetic memory was observed ( see fig . 5 ( b ) ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of gdcu , and presumably related to the absence of mt related phase coexistence .",
    "0.4 cm    memory in the fc magnetization can also occur due to a distribution of relaxation time for a poly - dispersive nanoparticle system .",
    "gdcu being a phase separated system , similar effect may also arise from the independent relaxation of metastable phase clusters .",
    "a probable way to rule out such possibility is to investigate the memory in the zfc magnetization , which is an unequivocal signature of glassy magnetic state originated from cooperative spin - spin interaction .",
    "@xcite here the protocol is the same as that of fc memory measurement , only the sample was cooled in zero field and allowed to relax at selected stops ( here 20 and 12 k ) in zero field only . while heating in 100 oe , the sample shows characteristic features at the point of stops . this is clearer in fig . 6 ( b ) , where we have subtracted the reference zfc curve ( @xmath37 , measured without stops ) from the memory curve ( @xmath38 measured with stops ) .",
    "the present observation clearly strengthens the view of spin glass like state in gdcu .",
    "notably , the reference and the ` memory ' curves coincide exactly at the low and high @xmath0 end points , which is a signature of the complete eradication of the memory upon heating and cooling .",
    "@xcite      the arrested dynamics of the glassy magnetic phase can be described by a ` free energy landscape picture ' , which consists of many local minima of the free energy separated by a distribution of finite energy barriers .",
    "@xcite if the system gets trapped in one such local minimum while cooling through the glass transition , the subsequent dynamics is governed by the thermal activation across the energy barriers .",
    "the memory effect and aging are the manifestation of the evolution from one free energy minimum to another with time .    in order to strengthen the observed memory ` dips ' in the @xmath18 data",
    ", we investigated the relaxation behavior with negative @xmath0 cycling as shown in fig . 7 ( a ) .",
    "the relaxation data was recorded in the zfc mode .",
    "the sample was first cooled down to @xmath39 = 15 k in zero field .",
    "subsequently , @xmath13 was recorded as a function of @xmath21 in presence of @xmath12 = 100 oe [ segment @xmath40 in fig .",
    "7 ( a ) ] .",
    "after 1 h , the sample was quenched in constant field to a lower @xmath0 , @xmath41 = 10 k and @xmath22 was recorded further for a time @xmath42 1 h [ segment @xmath43 .",
    "finally , @xmath0 is turned back to @xmath39 and @xmath13 was recorded for further 1 h [ segment @xmath44 .",
    "relaxation process during @xmath45 is simply a continuation of the process during @xmath40 .",
    "this memory effect reflects that the state of the system before cooling is recovered when the sample is cycled back to the initial @xmath0 .",
    "we also performed simultaneous @xmath12 and @xmath0 cycling to check the robustness of magnetic memory in the system [ fig . 7 ( b ) ] . here",
    "the protocol is very similar to that of the relaxation experiment depicted in fig .",
    "the only difference is that during the temperature quench to @xmath41 = 10 k , @xmath12 was also reduced to zero .",
    "the continuity of the @xmath22 curves before and after @xmath0 and @xmath12 cycling indicates that the sample is capable of retaining the history even for large change in @xmath13 ( about 10 times ) .",
    "0.4 cm    0.4 cm      it is known that for a nonergodic system , a small positive @xmath0 cycling can destroy the previous memory and rejuvenates the system .",
    "@xcite we performed such positive @xmath0 cycling in the relaxation data as shown in fig .",
    "the difference between the present protocol and that of fig . 7 ( a ) is that intermittently the sample was heated to a higher @xmath0 , @xmath46 = 20 k instead of cooling .",
    "a sharp contrast is observed between the results of fig .",
    "7 ( a ) and the present data : the relaxation curves @xmath47 ( before heating ) and @xmath48 ( after heating ) are found to have different nature and do not continue to posses similar @xmath13 values .",
    "this indicates that heating to a higher @xmath0 erases the memory and it is similar to the rejuvenation observed in various spin glasses and other nonergodic systems .",
    "@xcite    0.4 cm",
    "gdcu is a phase separated system and in analogy with the well known example of manganites , the glassy phase is likely to be connected to the coexisting phases .",
    "the phase separation in gdcu originates from the fopt which drives the system from high-@xmath0 c - phase to low-@xmath0 o - phase .",
    "the role of fopt related phase coexistence is evident from our experiment with analogous compound dycu .",
    "the dy - compound does not undergo fopt , although like gdcu , it has two magnetic transitions .",
    "the failure to observe memory in dycu indicates that low-@xmath0 glassy magnetic phase is somehow related to the fopt . in case of gdcu ,",
    "the thermal hysteresis is present over a very wide @xmath0 range , starting from 650 k to 140 k. this is the region of mt , where both o - phase and c - phase can coexist .",
    "however , phase coexistence down to very low-@xmath0 ( @xmath42 4 k ) was confirmed by neutron diffraction experiment",
    ". existence of the high-@xmath0 c - phase well below the region of mt indicates the _ arrested kinetics of the fopt _ ,  @xcite which allows the metastable c - phase to coexists with the low-@xmath0 o - phase .",
    "the c - phase becomes antiferromagnetically ordered below about 145 k , and the slow dynamics can originate from the  dependent magnetization of the frozen phase .",
    "arrested dynamics in structurally frozen phase has been observed in ti - ni shape memory alloys .",
    "@xcite however , our relaxation and memory experiments identify the glassy phase only below @xmath3 = 45 k , which is the onset point of hm order of the o - phase .",
    "therefore , it is not the metastability of the structurally frozen phases , rather the cooperative magnetic interaction which decides the glassyness .",
    "otherwise , one would expect the glassy behavior to originate right below @xmath49 out of the frozen dynamics of the coexisting structural phases .",
    "0.4 cm    our data also rules out the possibility of a glassy state originating from a distribution of relaxation time of noninteracting spin clusters , as observed in weakly interacting nanoparticles .",
    "had this been the scenario , we would not expect memory in the zfc measurement ( see fig . 6 ) . notably , unlike nanoparticles ,",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is rather weak in a gd - based system with total orbital quantum number @xmath50 = 0 .",
    "the likely mechanism behind the observed glassyness in gdcu lies in the magnetic correlation .",
    "since it occurs only below @xmath3 , the low-@xmath0 hm state plays a deciding role .",
    "the glassy phase below @xmath3 resembles the classical spin glass state , particularly from the evidence of zfc memory and aging ( figs . 6 and 4 respectively ) . in gdcu",
    "( both in the o and c phases ) , there is only one crystallographic site  @xcite for gd which may not be sufficient enough for competing magnetic interaction among atomic spins leading to frustration . in addition , geometrical frustration can be ruled out in a cubic or orthorhombic crystal structure ( both orthogonal ) .",
    "the only possibility that seems viable in the present case is the coexisting structural phases with contrasting magnetic character , which introduces frustration and disorder leading to spin glass like state .",
    "we propose following scenario for the observed glassyness , which has been depicted in fig .",
    "9 . as evident , gdcu has several magnetic and structural phases . above @xmath14",
    "( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the system is purely cubic and paramagnetic ( pm ) [ see fig .",
    "according to the terminology of mt in metallic alloys , @xmath14 is called the martensitic start temperature , below which the low-@xmath0 martensite starts to nucleate .",
    "as the system goes below @xmath14 , the o - phase develops within the matrix of c - phase , however both are pm in nature .",
    "when @xmath0 is further lowered , the fraction of o - phase increases . due to arrested kinetics , the complete transformation of the c - phase @xmath51 o - phase does not take place and a fraction of c - phase exists even at the lowest @xmath0 . now below @xmath2 ,",
    "the c - phase orders antiferromagnetically , but the o - phase fraction remains pm , and eventually it orders below @xmath3 . within the temperature region @xmath52 , mixed phase prevails in the sample .",
    "however , unless one goes below @xmath3 , the o - phase remains pm and can not introduce magnetic frustration . eventually at @xmath53 , both the coexisting phases become magnetically ordered and interfaces between two phases give rise to frustration owing to their conflicting magnetic character .",
    "the effect is analogous to the surface spin glass state in interacting @xmath54-fe@xmath55o@xmath56 nanoparticles  @xcite with phase boundaries in gdcu playing the part of surface layers of the nanoparticles .",
    "the interesting point seen in case of gdcu is that the spin glass like state does not originates right below the first order transition , rather it develops below the low-@xmath0 hm transition temperature point .",
    "the presence of c - phase and o - phase clusters may give rise to a frozen local strain order as observed in ti - ni alloys  @xcite , but that does not gives rise to a magnetic glassy phase as long as @xmath57 .",
    "it is to be noted that previous heat capacity study  @xcite showed broad peak around hm transition point , which is also a signature of the onset of glassy phase in a material .    in conclusion ,",
    "we observe glassy magnetic phase in gdcu marked by slow dynamics and clear memory effect .",
    "our results suggest that cooperative magnetic correlation between the coexisting phases is the primary cause of the observed spin glass like state",
    ". such understanding can be quite useful in interpreting the spin glass like state in other phase separated systems including manganites .",
