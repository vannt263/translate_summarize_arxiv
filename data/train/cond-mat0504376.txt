    "the upper limit corresponds the the standard rmt .",
    "the main goal of rmt is to describe the fluctuations of the energy spectra . before the study of the fluctuations",

    "the level density of the standard random matrix ensembles is not directly related to the physical level density of the investigated systems . nevertheless , it is essential to the proper unfolding of the spectral fluctuation measures . for the @xmath92-dimensional goe ,",

    "the behavior shown in this figure is similar to that of the results of calculations by toscano et al .",
    "@xcite .    in order to perform the statistical analysis of level fluctuations of the energy levels",
    ", one must take into account that the level density and hence the level spacing are strongly dependent on the intrinsic energy .",
    "for this purpose , the investigated spectra are transformed into the so - called unfolded spectra @xcite for which the local mean spacing is 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations using rmt are performed for levels near the origin , where the level density is nearly equal to a constant proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "the energy scale is so far defined by the standard deviation of matrix elements , as , e.g. in eq .",
    "it is more suitable to express the quantities having the dimension of energy in terms of the mean level spacing rather than standard deviation of matrix elements . for this purpose",

    "the nearest - neighbor - spacing distribution ( nnsd ) is frequently used for the analysis of experimental spectra .",
    "unfortunately , rmt does not provide a closed form expression for nnsd . a very good approximation for this distribution",
    "is given by the so - called wigner surmise @xcite , which is the exact spacing distribution for gaussian ensembles of @xmath46 matrices . in this section",

    "the wigner surmise is @xmath142 where @xmath35 is obtained by requiring that @xmath143 has a mean spacing equal 1 . substituting ( 26 ) into ( 25 ) , we obtain the following expression for the non - extensive ( tsallis ) orthogonal ensemble @xmath144 where @xmath145   ^{2}%\\ ] ] is obtained by requiring that @xmath146 .    in the limit of @xmath147 , @xmath148 and",
    "the non - extensive nnsd approaches the extensive one , which is peaked at @xmath149 . at the other limit where @xmath150 , beyond which the mean the spacing distribution diverges .",
    "if one also requires that the second moment is finite , one increases the lower limit into @xmath151 , for which one obtains @xmath152  and the nnsd becomes @xmath153 which vanishes at the origin , has a peak at @xmath154 , and decays asymptotically as @xmath155 .",
    "we therefore see that increasing non - extensivity modifies the nnsd from a wigner form towards a poisson distribution @xmath156  but never reaches it .",
    "equation ( 34 ) agrees with the corresponding result obtained for @xmath46 random matrix ensemble directly by integrating the joint eigenvalue distribution @xcite .",
