    "simple models of cluster - cluster aggregation have been the focus of a great deal of interest , particularly over the last two decades . the structure of aggregates formed through a variety of dominating mechanisms ( eg .",
    "diffusion limited @xcite , reaction limited @xcite and ballistic motion @xcite ) have been studied through theoretical , experimental , and computational work .",
    "another aggregation mechanism which is relevant to several physical systems is that of differential sedimentation .",
    "particles with a range of size and/or shape will almost inevitably sediment through a fluid at different speeds under the influence of gravity , leading to collisions .",
    "if there is some mechanism by which the particles stick on contact then aggregates will be formed .",
    "an example of this kind of phenomenon is the aggregation of ice crystals in cirrus clouds .",
    "small ` pristine ' ice particles are formed at the top of the cloud , and proceed to fall through it , colliding with one another and sticking to produce aggregates ( snowflakes ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a simple model for growth by differential sedimentation which captures the essential physics of the system in the inertial flow regime , and to consider its application to snowflake formation .",
    "it is divided into five main parts - a description of the model and the assumptions underlying it ; details of computer simulations and the results obtained from them ; a theory section which offers an argument to account for the behaviour observed in the simulations ; an investigation of the model s applicability to snowflake formation ; and a concluding discussion .",
    "the simulation results and their comparison to real cloud data have been presented briefly in a separate letter @xcite .",
    "we focus on the dilute limit , where the mean free path between cluster - cluster collisions is large compared to the nearest neighbour distance between clusters . in this regime",
    "we can limit our interest to individual binary collision events , ignoring spatial correlation . as further simplifying approximations",
    ", we assume that clusters have random orientations which do not significantly change during a close encounter , that collsion trajectories are undeflected by hydrodynamic interaction , and that any cluster - cluster contacts result in a permanent and rigid junction .    in order to sample the collisions between clusters ,",
    "we first formulate a rate of close approach .",
    "for any two clusters @xmath0 , @xmath1 with nominal radii ( see below ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively and fall speeds @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the frequency with which their centres pass closer than a distance @xmath6 is proportional to the total area over which trajectories yielding a close approach event are possible , and the relative speed of the pair .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ illustration ] .",
    "the rate constant for approach closer than centre - to - centre separation @xmath6 is therefore given by : @xmath7 in our computer simulations the nominal radii are chosen to fully enclose each cluster and the close approach rate calculated above is exploited to preselect candidate collision events .",
    "collisions are accurately sampled by sequentially choosing pairs of clusters with probability proportional to @xmath8 , checking each pair for collision along one randomly sampled close approach trajectory , and correspondingly joining that cluster pair if they do indeed collide . in the theoretical arguments presented in section four , we make the simplifying assumption that all close approaches lead to collisions ( or at least a fixed fraction of them do ) , using nominal radii based on fractal scaling from the cluster masses .",
    "the model is completed by an explicit form for the fall speeds entering equation ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we assume that the clusters are at most only partially penetrated by the fluid flow past them , so that cluster radius is the relevant length governing the drag force law",
    ". then qualitatively and by dimensional argument we expect the same drag behaviour as for a falling sphere , which may be written in the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a function of the reynolds number @xmath11 alone , @xmath12 is the density of the surrounding fluid , and @xmath13 is the kinematic viscosity . although details of the function @xmath14 should be different from spheres , we still expect to have inertial and stokes regimes where @xmath10 takes the forms : @xmath15 we consider below the general form @xmath16 , with @xmath17 as an adjustable parameter in order gain understanding spanning the two extreme regimes . setting the drag force equal to the weight @xmath18 of the cluster , the terminal velocity",
    "is then given by@xmath19 where @xmath20 for inertial flow and @xmath21 for viscous flow .",
    "a more complete discussion of the fall speed is given by mitchell @xcite , but provided @xmath22 so that cluster projected area scales as the square of cluster radius , this reduces to a simple crossover between the above limits .",
    "the empirical crossover is very slow , spread over some three decades of reynolds number , so fixed intermediate values of @xmath23 can reasonably approximate behaviour over a significant range @xcite . in our simulations we took the radius determining the fall velocity to be proportional to the radius of gyration , and in our theoretical calculations we simply used the same nominal radii as for the collision cross sections above .",
    "illustration showing a possible scenario in which the centres of a pair of clusters falling at a relative speed @xmath24 come within a distance @xmath25 of one another ( a close approach ) .",
    "the shaded circle illustrates the total area encompassing all possible close approach trajectories @xmath26 . ]",
    "the primary particles used at the beginning of the simulations were rods of zero thickness , half of which had a length ( and mass ) of unity , and half of which were twice as long and massive .",
    "purely monodisperse initial conditions are not possible in this model , since @xmath27 would be zero .",
    "apart from this special case however , it is anticipated that the asymptotic behaviour of the system should be insensitive to the initial distribution , and indeed the results described in this section appear to be preserved for a variety of starting conditions .    in aggregation models",
    "it is typically the case ( eg . vicsek and family @xcite ) that after the distribution has had time to ` forget ' its initial conditions it will approach a universal shape .",
    "this is usually expressed by the ` dynamical scaling ' ansatz , which states that as @xmath28 : @xmath29\\label{dynamicalscaling}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the number of clusters of mass @xmath31 at time @xmath32 , and the rescaled distribution @xmath33 is a function of @xmath34 alone .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is a characteristic cluster mass , and for non - gelling systems one expects that a suitable choice is given by the weight average cluster mass , @xmath36 . using this choice",
    "our simulation data conform well to scaling , as shown in the left panel of figure [ distribution ] .",
    "the shape of the rescaled distribution was studied .",
    "a plot of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 is shown in the right panel of figure [ distribution ] and shows an exponential decay for very large @xmath38 , with a ` super - exponential ' behaviour taking over as @xmath38 approaches unity from above .",
    "this behaviour appears to be universal for all values of @xmath17 in the range studied .        for @xmath39 the qualitative form of @xmath40",
    "was found to fall into two distinct catagories depending on the value of @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath41 the distribution appears to diverge as a power law : @xmath42 , as shown in figure [ distribution ] for @xmath43 .",
    "the exponent @xmath44 was found to be approximately constant at @xmath45 over the range @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath47 the distribution was found to be peaked , with a maximum at some small size @xmath48 , followed by a power law decay for @xmath49 .",
    "comparison with other aggregation models suggests that the clusters produced are likely to be fractal in their geometry , and in particular cluster mass and ( average ) radius should be in a power law relationship @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fractal dimension . a log plot of radius of gyration against mass for all the clusters produced over the course of the simulation is shown in figure [ rgm ] .",
    "also shown in this figure is the logarithmic derivative of the above plot , which shows the variation in the apparent fractal dimension of the clusters with size . from this plot",
    ", it seems that the fractal dimension approaches an asymptotic value as @xmath52 ; in the case shown ( @xmath43 ) we estimate this value as @xmath53 .",
    "the value of this limiting fractal dimension was found to vary with @xmath17 as shown in figure [ dfvsalpha ] .",
    "note that our assumption @xmath22 , required to support the assumed fall speed relationship , is indeed satisfied for the physical range @xmath54 .",
    "variation of the fractal dimension as a function of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "circles are simulation data , solid line indicates theoretical prediction . ]",
    "the most common theory used to describe cluster - cluster aggregation problems is that of von smoluchowksi @xcite , which provides a set of mean - field rate equations for the evolution of the cluster mass distribution : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of clusters of mass @xmath57 at time @xmath32 ( per unit volume ) .",
    "the kernel @xmath58 contains the physics of the problem , being a symmetric matrix , the elements of which govern the rate of aggregation between pairs of clusters expressed ( only ) in terms of their masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "analytical solutions of smoluchowski s equations have not been obtained except for a few special cases of @xmath58 .",
    "however , van dongen and ernst @xcite have shown that for non - gelling kernels ( see below ) the solutions approach the dynamical scaling form of equation ( [ dynamicalscaling ] ) in the large - mass , large - time limit ; substituting this into equations ( [ smol2 ] ) allows one to obtain some information about the asymptotic behaviour of the rescaled cluster size distribution @xmath40 .    to apply this theory we need to compute the reaction rates @xmath58 , which means averaging collision rate with respect to cluster geometry at fixed masses .",
    "this we estimate by substituting averages from fractal scaling for the radii in equations ( [ gamma ] ) for the close approach rate and ( [ fallspeed ] ) for the fall speeds , and assuming constant collision efficiency leading to : @xmath59 van dongen and ernst s analysis is sensitive to two exponents characterising the scaling of the coagulation kernel in the limit @xmath60,@xmath61 which in our case yields : @xmath62 a third exponent combination @xmath63 controls the growth of the average cluster mass through the differential equation @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a constant , and for the non - gelling case we require @xmath66 .",
    "our identification of the exponent @xmath67 is crucial to a mechanism by which the fractal dimension can control the dynamics .",
    "if the fractal dimension is low enough , then the exponent @xmath67 will exceed unity .",
    "however , van dongen @xcite has shown that the smoluchowski equations predict the formation of an infinite cluster instantly in such a situation . in a finite system",
    "this clearly can not occur , and it simply means that a few clusters will quickly become much larger than the others with their growth dominated by accretion of small ones . in this scenario the growth of the large clusters approaches that of ballistic particle - cluster aggregation , where it has been shown by ball and witten @xcite that the fractal dimension of the clusters produced tends to @xmath68 .",
    "this increased fractal dimension reduces the value of @xmath67 , forcing it back to a value of one if @xmath69 . through this feedback mechanism ,",
    "a bound is placed on the fractal dimension @xmath70 $ ] for @xmath69 .",
    "the system could perhaps settle in a state where @xmath71 .",
    "however , the growth in such a regime is much less biased towards collisions between clusters of disparate sizes , and the distribution is relatively monodisperse",
    ". this would tend to make collisions between clusters of a similar size likely , leading to much more open structures , with a lower fractal dimension , in turn acting as a feedback mechanism to increase the value of @xmath67 .",
    "the authors suggest that , at least over some range of @xmath17 , this effect will force the system towards the @xmath72 state .",
    "the discontinuity in the polydispersity of the system at @xmath72 forces the system to organise itself such that it can remain at that point .",
    "this is similar to the argument put forward by ball _",
    "@xcite for reaction limited aggregation .",
    "if it is accepted that @xmath73 then the fractal dimension of the clusters produced ought to be directly predictable from equation ( [ exponentnu ] ) : @xmath74,\\quad \\alpha \\leq \\frac{2}{3}.\\label{predictdf}\\ ] ] a curve showing this theoretical behaviour is superimposed on the simulation data in figure [ dfvsalpha ] , and appears to show good agreement up to @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 the theoretical prediction is that @xmath68 and @xmath77 , but because of its somewhat pathological nature we have not attempted to make simulations in this regime .",
    "it is however clear from the extrapolation of our results in figure [ dfvsalpha ] that this is likely to hold .",
    "obtaining an exact form for the cluster size distribution @xmath78 is a non - trivial exercise .",
    "however , following the methodology of van dongen and ernst @xcite , we consider the small-@xmath38 behaviour of @xmath78 when @xmath79 ( ie .",
    "@xmath80 ) . in such a regime",
    "the small-@xmath38 behaviour is dominated by collisions between clusters of disparate sizes ; the gain term in the smoluchowski equations may therefore be neglected , and one attempts to solve the integro - differential equation : @xmath81=\\phi(x)\\int _ { 0}^{\\infty}k(x , y)\\phi(y)\\text{d}y$ ] . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the kernel ( [ kernel3 ] ) may be approximated to @xmath83 , and one obtains : @xmath84\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 moment of the rescaled distribution @xmath78 , and the exponent @xmath44 is given by @xmath87 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath88=0 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath38 increases from zero , @xmath78 also increases , until reaching a maximum at @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath49 the distribution has an approximately algebraic decay @xmath90 .",
    "this ` bell - shaped ' curve is consistent with the behaviour seen in the computer simulations when @xmath47 .    in the case",
    "@xmath91 , it has been shown @xcite that for all kernels with @xmath92 , @xmath93 the cluster size distribution diverges as @xmath94 with the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the simulation for @xmath41 .",
    "the change in the qualitative shape of @xmath97 around @xmath20 then is further evidence to suggest that the system selects to sit at @xmath72 .",
    "the shape of @xmath98 has also been studied by van dongen and ernst @xcite .",
    "they have shown that for non - gelling kernels , the tail of the distribution is expected to take the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are constants .",
    "this would appear to be consistent with the behaviour observed in the simulations for all values of @xmath17 , providing an exponentially dominated cut - off at large @xmath38 .",
    "the principle motivation for the model presented in this paper was to attempt to understand some of the properties of cirrus clouds .",
    "these are high altitude clouds with a base betwen 5,500 and 14,000 metres and they are usually composed solely of ice crystals @xcite . amongst others , heymsfield and platt @xcite have observed that the ice crystals in these clouds are predominantly composed of columns , bullets , bullet - rosettes and aggregates of these crystal types .",
    "it is these aggregates which we hope to model , since the dominant mechanism by which they grow is believed to be through differential sedimentation ( eg . field and heymsfield @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore ignore the effects of diffusional growth , turbulence , mixing , and particle breakup , in order to concentrate on the effects of this mechanism alone .",
    "the reynolds number for aggregates of a few crystals is typically between @xmath102@xmath103 which ought to be modelled acceptably by our inertial flow approximation . because we have not modelled the detailed hydrodynamics we may also be ignoring subtleties such as wake capture .",
    "all of the results below are presented for the purely inertial regime ( assumed to be the most relevant to this problem ) where @xmath20 .",
    "the initial particles were rods of zero thickness - however , the asymptotic behaviour is anticipated to be insensitive to the initial conditions , and indeed by running the simulation with ` bullet rosettes ' for the initial particles ( three rods , crossing one another at right angles , through a common centre ) , no change in the end results were found , only in the approach to scaling .",
    "ice crystal aggregates have been studied through the use of cloud particle imagers during aircraft flights through ice clouds .",
    "sample images from such a flight are shown in figure [ images ] , alongside some of our simulation clusters . using this experimental data ,",
    "the geometry and size distribution of ice particles in these clouds has been studied , allowing for quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "projected images of a ) ice crystal aggregates obtained using a cloud particle imager ( cpi , spec inc .",
    ", usa ) during an aircraft flight through a cirrus cloud at temperatures between @xmath104c to @xmath105c , and b ) sample clusters from our simulations . ]",
    "the fractal dimension of snowflakes in cirrus may be inferred from the work of heymsfield _ et al _ @xcite . by measuring the effective density @xmath106 of bullet and bullet - rosette aggregates as a function of their maximum linear dimension @xmath107 , and fitting a power law to their data",
    ", they found the relationship @xmath108 .",
    "this scaling implies that the aggregates have a fractal dimension of @xmath109 , which is consistent with the values predicted by our model ( simulation giving @xmath110 and theory giving @xmath111 ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of the clusters may also be calculated .",
    "random projections of simulation clusters were taken .",
    "the maximum dimension of the projection @xmath107 was measured , as was the maximum dimension in the direction perpendicular to that longest axis , @xmath112 .",
    "the ratio of these two spans were binned by maximum dimension , averaged , and plotted as a function of @xmath107 as shown in figure [ aspect ] .",
    "the ratio quickly approaches an asymptotic value of approximately @xmath113 .",
    "this compares well to the measurements of korolev and isaac @xcite , where the ratio seems to approach a value of @xmath114 .",
    "aspect ratio of simulation clusters as a function of their maximum dimension .",
    "the curve seems to approach an asymptotic value of @xmath115 , independent of the initial conditions used : here we show data for both rods and rosettes . ]    finally",
    ", the shape of the snowflake distribution of linear size may also be compared with experiment .",
    "field and heymsfield @xcite presented particle size distributions of the maximum length @xmath107 of ice particles in a cirrus cloud .",
    "the data were obtained with an aircraft and represent in - cloud averages of particle size distributions ( number per unit volume per particle size bin width ) along 15 km flight tracks ranging from an altitude of 9500 m ( @xmath116c ) to 6600 m ( @xmath117c ) .",
    "to compare this data to the distributions obtained from simulation , we first normalise the data , and then make use of the dynamical scaling form ( [ dynamicalscaling ] ) , to collapse the distributions onto a single curve .",
    "details of this are given in the appendix to this paper .",
    "the resulting histograms are shown in figure [ rdist ] and appear to show quite good agreement , given the level of approximation present in our model .",
    "a simple mean - field model of aggregation by differential sedimentation of particles in an inertial flow regime has been constructed , simulated by computer , and analysed theoretically in terms of the smoluchowski equations .",
    "it has been shown that there is strong numerical evidence , in addition to a theoretical argument , to back up the idea that the polydispersity of the distribution and the fractal dimension feed back on one another in such a way as to stabilise the system at @xmath72 . above this value ,",
    "the dominance of collisions between clusters of very different sizes is so great as to push @xmath51 towards a value of three .",
    "this in turn pulls the exponent @xmath67 back down to unity . for @xmath71",
    "the system is quite monodisperse , resulting in relatively many collisions between clusters of similar sizes , and the fractal dimension is reduced , forcing @xmath67 back up .",
    "the discontinuity in the shape of the distribution around @xmath72 is thought to provide the mechanism by which the system can stabilise at that point .    if it is accepted that @xmath73 , then the fractal dimension of the clusters produced may be predicted , and figure [ dfvsalpha ] shows that this prediction agrees well with simulation results for @xmath118 .",
    "the sudden change in the behaviour of @xmath119 and in the small-@xmath38 form of the cluster size distribution around @xmath20 is strong evidence for the self - organisation proposed between @xmath51 and @xmath67 .    for @xmath120",
    "the system is forced into a regime where @xmath121 , which has been regarded as unphysical because the smoluchowski equation ( [ smol2 ] ) predicts infinite clusters in zero time @xcite . in the light of our results",
    "this regime merits further study beyond the smoluchowski equation approximation @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath122 is given by viscous flow , but here our form for @xmath123 does not include all of the relevant physics : in particular , small clusters may be caught in the fluid flow , and swept around larger clusters rather than hitting them , reducing the dominance of big - little collisions . this has been discussed in more detail for the particle - cluster aggregation case by warren _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the application of the model to the formation of ice crystal aggregates in cirrus clouds has been considered : the fractal dimension , aspect ratio , and shape of the cluster size distribution seen in the model were all found to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "this is a promising indication that the ideas presented in this paper may be an acceptable model for the essential physics of snowflake aggregation in cirrus .",
    "we are grateful to aaron bansemer for initial processing of the size distribution data and carl schmitt for supplying the cpi images .",
    "this work was supported financially by the engineering and physical sciences research council , and the meteorological office .",
    "experiments have reported the distribution of ice aggregates by linear span rather than by mass , and we present here how that distribution @xmath124 should naturally be rescaled .",
    "this tests the dynamical scaling ansatz which , for the mass distribution , gave @xmath125 , where @xmath126 in mass - conserving systems .",
    "we anticipate fractal scaling so that @xmath127 and hence : @xmath128 from this expression we may calculate the moments of the distribution @xmath129 in terms of the average cluster mass @xmath35 : @xmath130 where @xmath131 . at small sizes",
    "we expect @xmath90 . if @xmath132 therefore , the integral converges as @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . from our simulations , we have measured @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and so the lowest integer moment which scales in this way is the second .",
    "we therefore choose this to normalise our data : @xmath137^{-1}\\frac{\\text { d}n}{\\text { d}d}\\sim d^{d_{f}-1}s^{-1 - 2/d_{f}}\\phi \\left(\\frac{m}{s}\\right)\\ ] ] which , defining the average cluster diameter @xmath138 yields : @xmath137^{-1}\\frac{\\text { d}n}{\\text { d}d}\\sim ( d^{*})^{-3}\\psi \\left(\\frac{d}{d^{*}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath139 . hence , if we assume that @xmath51 approaches a constant value , plots of @xmath140^{-1}.\\frac{\\text { d}n}{\\text { d}d}.(d^{*})^{3}\\}$ ] against @xmath141 should all lie on a single curve .",
