    "<S> we calculate the vacuum energy for yang  mills ( ym ) system in the background space - time @xmath0 , taking the effect of self - interaction of the ym fields into account . </S>",
    "<S> the compactification scale obtained by candelas  </S>",
    "<S> weinberg mechanism becomes large if the ym coupling is large . </S>",
    "<S> the case with an extra space @xmath1 is also considered , and it is shown that the vacuum associated with broken gauge symmetry is unstable .    in kaluza - klein theories,@xcite the effect of vacuum polarizations is expected to play important roles in stabilizing the compact space@xcite as well as in determining the gauge symmetry in four dimensions.@xcite    however , in almost all the calculations of quantum effects in the kaluza - klein scheme ( except for ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only the one - loop approximation is taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> thus the calculation carried out so far might not reflect the quantum nature of self - interacting system such as gravitation and ym fields which are inevitably contained in string theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty in going beyond one - loop is caused partly from the lack of appropriate method in computing the higher - loop contribution unambiguously in arbitrary dimensions . in the previous paper,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the present authors have developed a technique to handle the ym interaction in vacuum diagrams when the background space - time metric has an extra space @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the approximation used in the calculation is more suitable for higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we can study the higher - loop effects by our method similarly to the one - loop technique , even if the extra space has a complicated structure . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show the vacuum energy for @xmath3 ym system defined in the background space - time @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the flat minkowski space - time and @xmath5 is the three sphere which has non - vanishing curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> we fast review our approximation scheme described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can find that the contributions of the vacuum graphs including only ym four - point interaction dominate over the ones of the other graphs of the same order in @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the ym coupling constant ) for large dimensionality , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it arises because the trace of the metric at a closed loop yields a factor @xmath8 for a vacuum diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the graphs which include three - point interactions with derivative couplings are sub - dominant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is conceivable that for large @xmath8 only four - point interaction is important and this simplifies the treatment of ym interactions of higher order . as a check , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the result of the one- and two - loop order of the vacuum energy for ym system in @xmath9 can be reconstructed when @xmath10 by using our method . in our approximation scheme , we start with the ym action where three - point interactions are omitted .    owing to this simplification , </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the vacuum energy becomes very transparent . </S>",
    "<S> we can utilize auxiliary fields @xcite to treat the non - linear interaction in the reduced lagrangian .    a difference from the previous work </S>",
    "<S> is the choice of the gauge group . for general gauge group , a quartic interaction which we preserve in the reduced action is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the structure constant of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> the other types of interactions are discarded because they can not produce the graphs of leading contribution ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we can give the expression of the effective action , in which the gauge fields appear in bilinear form , using auxiliary fields .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us concentrate on the specific case , @xmath3 ym theory . here </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly show the structure of the auxihary fields .    for concreteness </S>",
    "<S> , we use the gell - mann s notation.@xcite we find @xmath13 where the column and row correspond to the suffices @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse of this matrix is @xmath16 and then we use auxiliary fields @xmath17 to get the bilinear form with respect to the ym field . </S>",
    "<S> we rewrite the lagrangian as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the quantum fluctuation of the gauge field while @xmath20 means the covariant derivative involving the background classical fields .    now in order to get the vacuum energy , it is sufficient to find the effective potential @xmath21 in the one - loop approximation within the auxiliary fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the space - time volume , @xmath24 .    in the expression ( </S>",
    "<S> [ 5 ] ) , we implicitly take the formal determinant as the one which contains not only transverse and longitudinal components of the vector field but also faddeev - popov ghost fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the final expression should be obtained from @xmath21 by eliminating the auxiliary field x with the help of the equation of motion .    </S>",
    "<S> the regularization and the calculation technique of the one - loop vacuum energy is the same as ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the calculation for vector fields is parallel to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first we calculate the vacuum energy for @xmath3 ym fields in @xmath0 , where no background gauge field exists . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry suggests that the auxiliary fields should be set to an equal value , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have to solve one equation for the auxiliary field to obtain the value of the vacuum energy .     </S>",
    "<S> is plotted against the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=226 ]    the result for the vacuum energy normalized by @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the radius of @xmath5 ) is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the auxiliary fieldx has been solved by numerical calculation .    in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , the vacuum energy slightly increases as a dimensionless combination @xmath26 grows . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the limit @xmath29 yields the free case , i.e. , the vacuum energy for eight species of abelian gauge fields ( cf . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next let us suppose the vacuum energy in @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , allowed kaluza - klein modes of the ym field are restricted and dependent on the background classical gauge configurations in the extra space.@xcite    we consider the following two possible vacuum configurations of gauge fields as the following ; one is the trivial case , @xmath31 and the other is @xmath32 , where expresses the direction of the one of the azimuthal angle of @xmath5 ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the vacuum associated with the latter configuration </S>",
    "<S> , the four - dimensional gauge symmetry is reduced to @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the symmetry , we can set @xmath34 and @xmath35 then the quadratic part of the auxiliary fields in the vacuum energy is given as @xmath36    we have to solve two equations of the auxiliary fields simultaneously for each vacuum configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> , is plotted against the dimensionless parameter @xmath26.,width=226 ]    for the trivial vacuum , where we can set @xmath37 , the results of the numerical calculation for the vacuum energy normalized by @xmath27 is shown by fig .  2 , similarly to the case of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in the non - trivial case , however , we can not find the solution of the equation of motion of auxiliary fields for positive @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the quantum instability of the non - trivial vacuum , because @xmath40 s stand for `` effective squared - masses '' of the gauge bosons in physical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) . )    to summarize , we have computed vacuum energies for @xmath3 yang - mills theory in partially compactified background geometry in seven dimensions .    the details in the calculation of the vacuum energy will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy for the finite coupling constant in the background @xmath41 is shown in fig  1 . the compactification scheme which utilizes the positive vacuum energy and cosmological constant@xcite </S>",
    "<S> may not be drastically changed by the self - interaction effect . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the condition for the tuning of the cosmological constant to cancel the four - dimensional vacuum energy would be slightly modified . if @xmath42 the compactification scale is expected to become about several to ten percent larger than the free - fleld case .    as for the hosotani mechanism in the space - time @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the interaction forces the non - trivial vacuum to be unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the self - interaction plays the crucial role in the hosotani mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we can not advocate the quantum instability of non - trivial vacua for general gauge groups and manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to study the stability of the vacuum in this sense in general self - interacting fields in various dimensions and will report the result elsewhere . </S>"
