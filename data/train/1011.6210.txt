    "the initial time @xmath1 , when the transverse expansion starts is not equivalent to the time required for the equilibration of the system . a necessary condition for the thermalization",
    "is that the transverse and longitudinal pressures in the fluid become similar .",
    "one expects that in the initial stage of the collision , the longitudinal pressure is smaller than the transverse one .",
    "possible implementations of such a transient , nonequilibrium pressure anisotropy in hydrodynamic equations have been discussed @xcite . however , as noted above , the presence of the pressure anisotropy in the initial stage does not change the transverse spectra , elliptic flow or femtoscopy results .",
