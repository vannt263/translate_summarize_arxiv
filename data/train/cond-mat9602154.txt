    "in this paper we present the results of a study of the crossover from fermi liquid to polaron behavior in several related models of electrons interacting with dispersionless classical phonons .",
    "we use analytic techniques valid in weak and strong coupling limits , and we use the `` dynamical mean field '' method @xcite to obtain results at intermediate couplings . in a companion paper",
    "we present a detailed study of a more complicated model believed to be relevant to the `` colossal magnetoresistance '' manganites .",
    "the electron - phonon problem has been extensively studied .",
    "the `` polaron problem '' of a single electron coupled to a deformable medium has been understood in detail@xcite .",
    "the problem of a degenerate fermi gas coupled to phonons has been solved perturbatively in a weak coupling limit@xcite .",
    "there has also been fairly extensive work aimed at going beyond the original perturbative solution@xcite , but this work has been aimed mostly at understanding superconducting transition temperatures and charge density wave instabilities . the self - trapping or polaron physics has received less attention .",
    "there are several experimental motivations for our work .",
    "one is the `` colossal magnetoresistance '' materials @xmath0@xcite , where @xmath1 is a rare earth such as lanthanum and @xmath2 is a divalent metal ion such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 . for @xmath5",
    "these are metals at low temperatures and `` insulators '' ( in the sense that the resistivity is high , and rises as @xmath6 is lowered ) at high temperatures .",
    "the insulating behavior has been argued to be due to a self trapping of carriers in local lattice distortions@xcite .",
    "the physics of this material is complicated by the existence of an additional `` double - exchange '' carrier spin interaction , and will be discussed in a companion paper .",
    "@xmath7 is another compound in which carrier localization by lattice distortions has been discussed@xcite .",
    "previous work on @xmath7 has focussed on density wave order at particular , commensurate , @xmath8 but the effects discussed here are likely to be relevant also .",
    "we also mention the many semiconducting compounds which display polaron effects when very lightly doped @xcite . at higher dopings , fermion degeneracy effects will become important , but the electron - phonon interaction will remain strong .",
    "we study models of electrons interacting with phonons .",
    "the electrons may or may not have spin and orbital degeneracy and are coupled to one or two independent local oscillators .",
    "the motivation for studying these different but closely related models is as follows .",
    "the interplay of polaron and fermi liquid physics is controlled by energy and entropy .",
    "the competing energies are the electron delocalization or kinetic energy @xmath9 and the lattice energy @xmath10 gained by localizing an electron .",
    "the entropy of a localized electron depends upon the number of spin and orbital states available for it to localize into , while the entropy of the phonons depends on the phase space of the oscillators .",
    "because the different models have different entropies , we expect them to behave differently at nonzero temperatures .",
    "our study has several limitations .",
    "first , the numerical results are obtained via the dynamical mean field approximation .",
    "this is a controlled approximation which however becomes exact only in a limit in which the spatial dimension @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "studies of other models have indicated that for @xmath12 the results are qualitatively correct and indeed in good numerical agreement with those obtained by other methods and by experiment@xcite .",
    "the quantitative accuracy for quasi 2d materials such as @xmath7 is not clear .",
    "further , the dynamical mean field approximation is essentially local .",
    "the only density wave instability which may be studied is the commensurate ( @xmath13 ) density wave , and the reliability of the approximation even for this case has not been established .",
    "we have not considered density wave solutions at all in this work .",
    "we have also assumed classical phonons .",
    "this approximation is known in the single - electron case not to affect the physics significantly @xcite ( although it does lead to a few easily diagnosed low temperature pathologies ) , and it dramatically simplifies the computations .",
    "however , it does mean that we are unable to study superconductivity .",
    "a third limitation is that we study models in which the only interaction is the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "in particular , we omit the on - site `` hubbard - u '' coulomb interaction , which is undoubtedly important in at least some oxide materials@xcite .",
    "while the approximations we have made limit the direct applicability of some of our results to experimental data on these materials , many of our results are experimentally relevant and we believe it is useful to have a detailed account of the behavior of a well - defined model in the literature . at various places in the text",
    "we will qualitatively discuss the effects of non - classical phonons and of the on - site coulomb interactions , but a quantitative treatment will be left to a future publication .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii defines the models , the parameters , and the approximations .",
    "section iii discusses the numerical methods used .",
    "section iv presents the results of a detailed solution of the simplest model , a non - degenerate band of spinless electrons interacting with a single oscillator .",
    "we give phase diagrams , electron spectral functions , frequency , and temperature dependent conductivities and phonon probability distributions .",
    "section v discusses the changes that occur if electron spin and orbital degeneracy , and multiple oscillators are included .",
    "section vi is a conclusion .",
    "appendix a clarifies the relation between the results presented here and those of the conventional migdal - eliashberg treatment of the electron - phonon problem . the other appendices present details of various calculations",

    "the electron - phonon coupling is @xmath42 .",
    "if both the electrons and the phonons are degenerate , then one may have a coupling between the orbital state of the electron and the direction of the local phonon .",
    "such coupling may be expected to occur in materials such as @xmath43 in which the jahn - teller effect is important @xcite . in such materials",
    "there are in the absence of lattice distortions two degenerate electronic states on each site , transforming as a two dimensional representation of the cubic group .",
    "the degeneracy may be split by interaction with an appropriate phonon mode .",
    "the interaction expressing this physics is prescribed by group theory to be @xmath44 here @xmath45 is a vector of pauli matrices acting in the orbital subspace and @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "one important energy scale is the electron banding or kinetic energy .",
    "this depends upon the band filling @xmath48 and the details of the hopping matrix elements @xmath30 , but it is roughly of order @xmath49 , where @xmath49 is a typical value of @xmath30 .",

    "physical quantities may be calculated from the partition function , @xmath60 , which may be written as a functional integral over the electron and phonon fields .",

    "the connection to the conventional treatment of the electron - phonon problem is discussed in more detail in appendix a.    at intermediate coupling we have not succeeded in constructing the ground state about which to expand .",
    "we have therefore resorted to the `` dynamical mean field '' approximation@xcite in which it is assumed that the electron self energy is local ( i.e. momentum independent ) . in the electron - phonon problem in three spatial dimensions",
    "the self energy is known to have only a weak momentum dependence in the various solvable limits@xcite , so the dynamical mean field approximation , which formally becomes exact in a limit in which spatial dimensionality @xmath11 , seems likely to be reliable .",

    "incorporating intersite correlations is an important open problem .    of course , as @xmath54",
    "is decreased , the possible energy gain increases and at some point the mid - gap states split and the two pieces join the upper and lower bands .",
    "the resulting intermediate coupling regime corresponds to a uniform electron density and a uniform nonzero lattice distortion .",
    "the electron spectral function consists of two bands , with the fermi level in the lower one ( for @xmath313 ) . the rigid band like state gains kinetic energy @xmath314 relative to the three band state , because one band is not fully filled , but is shown in appendices d and e to be more costly in jahn - teller energy because the lattice distortion is not as large .",
    "as the coupling is increased at @xmath159 three phases are in principle possible : a weak coupling phase with a single - peaked spectral function , a `` rigid band '' phase with a two peaked speactral function and the fermi level in the lower band , and an insulating three peaked spectral function . determining the couplings at which the system goes from one phase to another in general requires numerical solution of the coupled mean field equations , along with comparison of the energies of different locally stable solutions . however , in the limit @xmath315 the equations simplify and a straightforward physical argument may be used . consider the @xmath274 problem in the insulating regime in which the spectral function has two peaks separated by a gap and calculate the electron removal spectrum allowing the on - site lattice distortion to adjust .",

    "as @xmath42 is increased further , the peaks separate and eventually a gap develops between them ( although the ground state remains conducting ) .",

    "10 . on the other hand , for @xmath324 the results of",
    "appendix e show that the weak coupling one = peak spectral function proceeds directly to the three peaked one via a first order transition .",
    "one important consequence of the central feature appearing in the three - peak regime is that it acts to fill in the gap created by the lattice distortion , so that one must go to stronger couplings and lower temperatures to see insulating behavior in the jahn - teller case than in the non - degenerate case .",
    "this may be seen directly from the strong coupling calculations of appendices c and e. in the non - degenerate case the spectral function has two features , at @xmath325 and physical quantities are controlled by the energy gap between them , which is of about the same size . in the jahn - teller case the highest and lowest of the three peaks",
    "are still separated by an energy of @xmath326 , but physical processes are controlled by the gap separating the lowest and middle peaks , which is much less .",

    "we have used the dynamical mean field method to study the crossover from fermi liquid to polaron behavior in models of electrons coupled to localized classical phonons .",
    "the models we studied involved electrons with and without spin and orbital degeneracy coupled to degenerate and non - degenerate phonons .",
    "we considered two forms of electron - phonon coupling : conventional , in which the phonon displacement couples to the electron charge density , and jahn - teller , in which the phonon displacement couples to the splitting of the electronic levels .",
    "we showed that as @xmath125 three regimes may be distinguished . in _",

    "examples of the evolution of the @xmath159 momentum - integrated spectral function with coupling strength are shown in figs . 1 and 10 .",
    "figure 1 is calculated for the simplest model at half - filling , but the results at any filling for any model involving coupling of the oscillator to the charge density of the electrons are similar .",
    "the only important effects are that away from half - filling in the strong coupling limit the relative weights of the two peaks are different and that there is at @xmath159 a discontinuous , rather than continuous , change in the spectral function and @xmath333 as the coupling is increased .",
    "we believe , but have not proven , that at any @xmath275 the change is continuous . the evolution of the spectral function for the case of jahn - teller coupling is shown in fig . 10 .",
    "the significant difference is the presence of the mid - gap feature in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "this has relative weight @xmath334 and corresponds physically to sites unoccupied by electrons .",
    "this mid - gap feature means that for jahn - teller couplings and @xmath273 the gap controlling physical properties is much smaller at given coupling than it is in models in which the phonon is coupled to the charge density , and the mid - gap state is absent .",
    "three physical effects have been left out of our calculation .",
    "one is the on - site coulomb repulsion , which is certainly important in transition metal oxides .",
    "the coulomb interaction tends to localize electrons , with the effect being strongest at commensurate fillings and so will tend to reinforce the localizing effect of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "because the localizing effect of the coulomb interaction is strongest at commensurate fillings , this will also lead to an interesting doping dependence : the effective electron - phonon coupling will weaken as @xmath48 is varied from @xmath335 .",
    "the coulomb interaction will also change the form of the spectral function , because it raises the energy of states with two electrons on the same site .",
    "for example , the uppermost peak of the strong - coupling spectral function shown in fig .",
    "10 corresponds physically to the density of states for adding an electron to a site with one electron already present , at fixed phonon configuration .",
    "coulomb effects will shift this energy upwards .",
    "a quantitative treatment of these effects within the present formalism will be left to a future paper .",
    "a second important piece of physics is quantum fluctuations of the phonons . at low temperatures and in the absence of long range order , these will allow electrons to move from site to site even in the strong coupling regime , so cutting off the strong - coupling divergence in the resistivity .",
    "one mathematical consequence is the appearance of gaussian tails to the spectral functions in the gap regions .",
    "a third omitted piece of physics is long range order .",
    "it has been assumed throughout that the lattice distortions are random from site to site ; thus the localization is due purely to polaronic effects . near commensurate densities , charge density wave effects will be important as well .",
