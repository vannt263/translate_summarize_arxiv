    "since the first @xmath7 radiative penguin decays of b mesons have been reported by cleo in 1993  @xcite , the measurements of radiative penguins at the b factory experiments babar and belle have expanded into a rich field of physics .",
    "as many as 15 individual exclusive @xmath1 modes have been observed and some of the corresponding branching fractions have been measured with a precision of about @xmath8 .",
    "this makes it possible to test sm predictions of these rare decays , e.g. qcd calculations of form factors .",
    "additionally , the inclusive measurement of @xmath9 allows strong constraints on new physics models  @xcite and precision measurements of heavy quark effective theory predictions . with the success of the @xmath1 penguin measurements in hand ,",
    "the next step is to explore @xmath0 penguins , which due to cabbibo suppression are not only about one order of magnitude more rare , but also face a much more severe background due to the abundance of pions in the background .",
    "this paper gives an overview of the recent results from babar for the exclusive modes @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",
    "section  [ sec : newphysics ] will briefly discuss the interest in these measurements from the point of view of the search for new physics , sections  [ sec : btodll ] and [ sec : btodg ] will summarize the measurements , an discuss the measurement of @xmath5 from @xmath11 .",
    "( 20,15 )    ( 20,15 )    ( 20,15 )    the beauty of the search for new physics in penguin decays lies in the fact that the dominating diagram in the sm is a loop or box diagram with heavy particles in the loop .",
    "this is exemplified in figure  [ fig : newphysicsgraphs ] .",
    "possible new physics , supersymmetry ( susy ) or the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) in this case , contribute with particles in the same mass range of 100 to several hundred gev and often also with similar couplings .",
    "this allows strong constraints on new physics models .",
    "however , while the measurement of exclusive decays is often experimentally clean , the interpretation of the experimental results for very rare exclusive decays often suffers from theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of form factors , radiative corrections , and other suppressed graphs .",
    "still , strong constraints and precise sm measurements can be gained from ratios of branching fractions .",
    "( 40,20 )    ( 40,20 )    the smallest @xmath13 branching fractions measured up to now are the @xmath14 modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite in comparison to that , @xmath17 is expected to be suppressed by @xmath18 , with the most recent prediction of @xmath19 .  @xcite any deviation from this order of magnitude would be a striking sign of new physics . the two dominating diagrams for this transition are shown in figure  [ fig : btodllpenguins ] , showing one penguin and one @xmath20 box diagram .     + ( a )",
    "+ ( b )    the babar analysis  @xcite on a dataset of @xmath21 faces another experimental challenge with respect to @xmath22 in addition to the reduced branching fraction , namely the much higher rate of @xmath23 in the background than @xmath24 .",
    "the analysis strategy is to first select clean @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 candidates and then veto resonances decaying into @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 events are strongly reduced by requiring two @xmath29  gev leptons in the event . the charmonium veto against @xmath30 events",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : btodllpeakingbackground ]  ( a ) .",
    "the tilt in the mass veto stems from the fact that events with bremsstrahlung of one of the leptons are off both in mass and in reconstructed energy , visible in @xmath31 .",
    "event shape variables against continuum events are grouped in a fisher discriminant , and event shape variables against @xmath32 background events are grouped into a likelihood .",
    "after these cuts , only combinatoric background from @xmath33 and @xmath32 events are left .",
    "backgrounds are controlled with various control samples ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "hadronic mistags are measured in a separate study by inverting the hadron vetos and then imposing the measured mistag rates as event weights .",
    "the resulting small peaking background fraction is shown in figure  [ fig : btodllpeakingbackground ]  ( b ) with @xmath36 on the left and @xmath37 on the right side .",
    "finally , the background in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 sidebands is extrapolated into the signal region ( see figure  [ fig : btodllresults ] ) to assess the background level independent of the mc simulation .",
    ".__results of the @xmath10 selection and limits on the branching fraction inferred from the absence of an excess over the sm background . _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     no excess over the background is observed , hence limits are set using a frequentist cut - and - count method in the signal boxes . the resulting limit of @xmath19 assuming isospin symmetry is within a factor of 3 of the sm prediction . a detailed summary of the results can be found in table  [ tab : btopillresults ] .",
    "@xmath41 penguins have been first observed by belle with @xmath42 with evidence for the @xmath43 mode  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the possibility of finding new physics if the measured branching fractions exceed @xmath44 for the neutral mode or @xmath45 for the charged mode significantly , it offers the important possibility to measure @xmath5 via @xmath46 with @xmath47  @xcite containing radiative corrections and sub - dominant helicity suppressed @xmath20-fusion diagrams ( hence depending on @xmath48 and the ckm fit itself and thus not uncorrelated from @xmath5 ) , and a form - factor ratio of @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the graphs involved here are expected to have completely independent possible new physics contributions than @xmath50 , hence the comparison of the two results is very important .    here",
    ", the experimental challenge lies not only in the particle i d requirements to suppress @xmath24 background , but also in the @xmath23 combinatorics coming from the wide resonance states ( @xmath51 ) and the high photon background from continuum events with @xmath52 .",
    "the babar analysis  @xcite on @xmath53 of data tackles this challenge by a likelihood veto against @xmath54 based on the invariant mass of the photon pair and the energy of the lower energetic photon , improving the veto significantly over a simple cut on @xmath55 .",
    "additionally , a neural net ( nn ) based continuum suppression is applied .    to extract the result ,",
    "a simultaneous maximum - likelihood fit is performed to @xmath56 , the nn output and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the helicity angle of the vector meson @xmath59 or @xmath60 , which are transversely polarized in signal events . for @xmath60 , the dalitz angle of the @xmath60 decay is used additionally .",
    "an example fit is shown for the @xmath4 mode in figure  [ fig : rhofit ] .",
    "many control sample checks are performed . with off - peak data used to control the continuum simulation , and",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 used to control resolutions and efficiencies .",
    "lcc mode & result & significance + @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 +   + @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 +    the result for the individual modes and different combinations is shown in table  [ tab : btorhogresults ] . while the @xmath75 signal is not yet significant on its own , this result represents the first evidence for @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : babarbellecomparison ] shows the good agreement of the results with the sm predictions and the agreement with the earlier belle results .",
    "the result for the isospin combination @xmath77 is to be taken with care , however , since the @xmath60 does not belong to the isospin triplet .",
    "the results of @xmath72 can be used to extract @xmath5 using eq .",
    "[ eq : vtdvts ] . using the world average of @xmath78 ,",
    "a value of @xmath79  @xcite can be extracted , in very good agreement with the result obtained from @xmath80 of @xmath81 from the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "while the precision from @xmath77 is not sufficient to compete with @xmath82 , it provides an important independent check of possible new physics , due to the different nature of the possible new physics contributions in the two processes .",
    "a comparison of the two results with the ckm fit and the imposed constrained in the @xmath83 plane of the ckm parameterization can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltamvsbtorho ] .",
    "with the extraordinary luminosities of the b - factories belle and babar , the field of strange radiative penguin decays of the b meson has evolved into one of the most important areas of precision measurements in the search of new physics .",
    "while it is still unclear whether @xmath2 transitions will be seen in the lifetime of the present b - factories , the rare decay @xmath41 has now been seen by belle and babar , and these measurements will possibly evolve towards precision measurements in the same way as the @xmath9 decays before . with the anticipated @xmath84 of luminosity per b - factory at the end of 2008 , a @xmath85 measurement of the cp asymmetry in @xmath77 should be feasible .",
    "another interesting measurement would be the isospin asymmetry @xmath86 , which presents a completely new way of obtaining a measurement of the ckm - angle @xmath87 , as outlined in  @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaai ] .",
    "the author would like to thank the pep - ii accelerator and its crew for the excellent luminosity delivered to babar , and the radiative penguin analysis group in babar for lots of support and very lively discussions .",
