    "although approximate equations ( [ n11 ] ) are independent of @xmath3 , our derivation clearly shows that the kerr nonlinearity plays a crucial role in the truncation process . by assuming that both oscillators are initially in vacuum states , @xmath45 , and parameters @xmath19 and @xmath16 are real , we find the following solutions of ( [ n11 ] ) for the time - dependent probability amplitudes : @xmath46 , \\notag \\\\ c_{01}&=&\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}\\left(\\cos\\tau _",

    "the numerical results shown in figure 2 confirm the validity of our analytical approach at least for short evolution times .",

    "solutions for probability amplitudes of the truncated states enable a simple calculation of quantum entanglement , which is one of the most fundamental resources of quantum information theory @xcite .",

    "we see in figure 3(a ) that the rapid oscillations in time ( with a period @xmath82 ) are modulated by oscillations of low frequency ( with period @xmath83 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "their maxima are of various values but some of them approach 1 ebit corresponding to the formation of bell states . to show this explicitly , we represent the generated state in the basis @xmath84 spanned by the bell - like states :    = 4.4 cm = 4.4 cm    = 4.4 cm = 4.4 cm    = 4.4 cm = 4.4 cm    @xmath85    which differ from the standard bell states only by the phase factor @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 , so states ( [ n21 ] ) will shortly be referred to as the bell states .",

    "since the frequencies of oscillations in ( [ n20 ] ) are incommensurate , by waiting long enough ( assuming no dissipation ) , we can achieve 1 ebit with high precision .",

    "the bell states @xmath99 and @xmath100 , being superpositions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are not generated if the initial state is vacuum and @xmath101 .",
    "this conclusion can be drawn by observing that the probabilities for @xmath99 and @xmath100 can reach only @xmath102 in figure 5(b ) . however , by relaxing the condition of equal couplings @xmath16 and @xmath19 , as shown in figure 6(b ) , bell states @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be generated from vacuum with high precision in the dissipation - free system .",

    "the above solutions for the initial single - photon states are included for completeness of our mathematical approach to show that , in principle , all bell states can be generated in our system even for @xmath101 .",
    "but it should be stressed that the system with the initial fock states is much more experimentally challenging than that assuming initially the vacuum states only . despite of experimental difficulty ,",
    "our system enables generation of the one - photon fock states from vacuum assuming no coupling @xmath16 between the modes , which corresponds to having two independent pumped cavities with nonlinear kerr media .",

    "the hamiltonian describing such a system is of the form @xmath115 which is the same as that defined by ( [ n01])([n04 ] ) , except for the extra term given by @xmath116 corresponding to the coupling of the cavity mode @xmath12 with an external driving single - mode classical field ( say , with frequency @xmath117 ) , where the parameter @xmath118 describes the strength of this interaction being proportional to the classical field amplitude .",

    "nevertheless , master equation ( [ n38 ] ) with liouvillian ( [ n39 ] ) and hamiltonian @xmath171 set to @xmath21 was used in a number of works both for @xmath166 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) but also for @xmath170 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , the same master equation , given by ( [ n38 ] ) for @xmath151 set to ( [ n02 ] ) , for coupled anharmonic oscillators was applied in , e.g. , @xcite . liouvillian ( [ n39 ] ) for @xmath170 was also used in ( @xcite p. 210 ) to describe a model essentially similar to ours comprising a nonlinear system , in which two quantized field modes in a cavity interact with a classical pump field .",
    "the standard liouvillian for @xmath170 was also used in @xcite to describe a system of kerr nonlinearity , given by @xmath21 , and a parametric amplifier driven by a pulsed classical field .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that a realistic master equation for kerr medium @xcite is more complicated .",
    "phase damping ( also referred to as dephasing ) can be described by ( [ n35 ] ) assuming @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which gives the following loss hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath174 this interaction can be interpreted as a scattering process , where the number of photons remains unchanged contrary to the interaction described by ( [ n37 ] ) .",
    "phase damping is essential in a fully quantum picture of dissipation of our system . as a simple generalization of the gardiner - zoller master equation for a single harmonic oscillator ( @xcite , equation ( 6.1.15 ) )",
    ", we describe phase damping of our two - mode nonlinear system by master equation ( [ n38 ] ) for the liouvillian @xmath175 \\notag \\\\",
    "\\quad   + \\frac{\\gamma_b}{2 } ( 2 \\bar n_b+1 ) [ 2\\hat b^\\dag \\hat b \\hat \\rho \\hat b^\\dag \\hat b - ( \\hat b^\\dag \\hat b)^2",
    "\\hat \\rho-\\hat \\rho ( \\hat b^\\dag \\hat b)^2 ] , \\label{n41}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is significantly different from ( [ n39 ] ) .",
    "to analyze dissipative evolution , governed by master equations ( [ n38 ] ) for liouvillians ( [ n39 ] ) and ( [ n41 ] ) , we apply standard numerical procedures for solving ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients as an exponential series .",
    "the entropy of entanglement @xmath72 , given by ( [ n16 ] ) , is valid for qudits of arbitrary dimension in a pure state , but it fails to determine entanglement of a system in a mixed state .",
    "thus , for a two - qubit mixed state @xmath176 , we have to apply more general measure , e.g. , the wootters measure of entanglement of formation given by @xcite : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is given by ( [ n18 ] ) with the argument being the concurrence @xmath179 defined as @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath182 , while @xmath183 is the pauli spin matrix of the @xmath162th qubit ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the entanglement of formation goes into the entropy of entanglement for any two - qubit pure states .",
    "examples of evolution of the entanglement of formation and fidelity for the dissipative systems are shown in figures 811 both for quiet and noisy reservoirs . by analyzing the figures , the most important observation is that the generated two - qubit entangled states are very fragile to the leakage of photons from the cavities in the analyzed couplers .",
    "our system is more fragile to losses described by the standard master equation , given by ( [ n38 ] ) and ( [ n39 ] ) , rather than the losses due to only phase damping as described by the gardiner - zoller master equation , given by ( [ n38 ] ) and ( [ n41 ] ) . inclusion of reservoir noise , at least for the assumed low mean numbers @xmath184 of thermal photons , does not cause a dramatic deterioration of fidelity and entanglement in comparison to the losses caused by coupling the system to the zero - temperature reservoirs .",
    "note that we have chosen @xmath185 in the dephasing model shown in figure 11 and much smaller value of @xmath186 in the standard dissipation model in figure 9 .",
    "the reason is that for the latter dissipation model , the number of photons in the system can be increased by absorbing thermal photons from the reservoirs .",
    "if this absorption of thermal photons exceeded the loss of the system photons to the reservoirs then the generated fields could not be approximated as two - qubit states and the wootters function @xmath187 , given by ( [ n42 ] ) , would fail to be a good entanglement measure . for the parameters chosen in figure 9 ,",
    "the generated states are well approximated by two - qubit density matrices and thus its entanglement of formation is well described by ( [ n42 ] ) . by contrast , the number of system photons is not affected by the reservoirs in the dephasing model ; thus ( [ n42 ] ) can be used for any number @xmath186 of thermal photons .",
    "finally , it should be noted that fragility of our system to dissipation seems to be a serious drawback from an experimental point of view .",
    "nevertheless , a method which enables a significant improvement of the entanglement robustness of the generated states , has recently been suggested for a similar system @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial conditions for the successful truncation and generation of the bell states in our scheme concerns the couplings @xmath32 , @xmath120 and @xmath33 to be much smaller than the kerr nonlinearities @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the kerr interaction should be strong at very low light intensities .",
    "thus , it is desirable to discuss an implementation , in which such stringent conditions can experimentally be satisfied .",
    "a possible realization can be based on the effect of the electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) or atomic dark resonances as proposed by schmidt and imamolu @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the schmidt - imamolu eit scheme can be realized in a low density system of four - level atoms , which level structure is shown in figure 12 , exhibiting giant resonantly - enhanced kerr nonlinearity at very low intensities .",
    "the atoms are placed in cavity @xmath11 ( and analogously in cavity @xmath12 ) tuned to frequency @xmath13 of the mode @xmath11 resonant with the transition @xmath188 and detuned by @xmath189 of the transition @xmath190 .",
    "the eit effect is created by a classical pumping field of frequency @xmath18 resonant with the transition @xmath191 ( see @xcite ) , all the atomic levels can adiabatically be eliminated , which results in the following formula for the kerr nonlinearity @xcite : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is third - order nonlinear susceptibility , @xmath194 are the coupling coefficients , @xmath195 is the rabi frequency of the classical driving ( and coupling ) field , @xmath196 is the electric dipole matrix element between the states @xmath197 and @xmath198 , @xmath199 is the total number of atoms contained in the cavity of volume @xmath200 , and @xmath201 is the permittivity of free space . by replacing subscript @xmath11 by @xmath12 in ( [ n44 ] ) ,",
    "an analogous expression for @xmath4 can be obtained . by putting the stringent limit on the required cavity parameters @xcite , imamolu _ et al . _",
    "estimated @xmath202 rad / sec @xcite .",
    "note that some quantum information applications of these giant kerr nonlinearities have already been studied @xcite .",
    "more details about application of the schmidt - imamolu scheme of resonantly - enhanced kerr nonlinearity in the analysis of dissipation effects on entanglement generation are given by one of us in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing the differences between the present paper and our former works .",
    "( i ) in @xcite , only the single - mode pumped systems were studied . here",
    ", we analyze also two - mode pumped systems , which is basically a different model .",
    "( ii ) the model described in @xcite is crucially different from the one used here as was based on the two - mode _ nonlinear _ interaction term @xmath203 . in the present work , as well as in @xcite , we apply the two - mode _ linear _ interaction hamiltonian @xmath204 , which is the same ( by neglecting the pump terms @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) as that used in @xcite .",
    "the other novelties of the present work in comparison to @xcite can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) for single - mode pumped system , we found a new generalized solution ( [ n12 ] ) , which , in a special case of equal couplings @xmath19 and @xmath16 , simplifies to our former solution obtained in @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) analytical approximate solutions were found here for various initial fock states @xmath207 . in @xcite , solutions were given for initial vacuum states only .",
    "( 3 ) here , we describe a possible realization of the model based on the effect of the electromagnetically - induced transparency .",
    "( 4 ) in present numerical analysis based on the eit scheme , in comparison to @xcite , more realistic parameters were chosen for the coupling constants , kerr nonlinearities , and damping constants .",
    "( 5 ) the deterioration of the fidelity of the generated bell states due to the standard dissipation and phase damping was analyzed here within two types of master equations both for quiet and noisy reservoirs . by contrast",
    ", analysis of losses in @xcite was limited to the standard master equation and for the quiet reservoir only .",
    "no effect of dissipation was studied in @xcite .",
    "( 6 ) in the present manuscript , entanglement of formation was calculated analytically for dissipation - free systems and calculated numerically for dissipative systems .",
    "no analytical formulae were given in @xcite , while the entanglement of formation was not at all studied in @xcite .",
    "( 7 ) the quality of truncation was described here , but it was not studied in @xcite .",
    "discrepancy between the really generated states and the exact truncated states was measured here by the fidelity .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have described a realization of the generalized two - mode optical - state truncation of two coherent modes via a nonlinear process .",
    "our system is a two - mode generalization of the single - mode nonlinear quantum scissors device described in @xcite .",
    "we have described an implementation of the kerr nonlinear couplers , where resonantly enhanced nonlinearities can be achieved in the schmidt - imamolu eit scheme .",
    "we have compared kerr nonlinear couplers linearly excited in one or two modes by external classical fields .",
    "we have shown under assumption of the coupling strengths to be much smaller than the nonlinearity parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 that the optical states generated by the couplers are the two - qubit truncated states spanned by vacuum and single - photon states .",
    "although our approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation are independent of @xmath208-constants , the kerr nonlinearity plays a crucial role in the physics as we have derived from the complete @xmath208-dependent hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the kerr interaction is the mechanism in our model , which enables truncation of the generated state at some energy level .",
    "by contrast , the system without the kerr nonlinearities and pumped by an external field would gain more and more energy . to confirm our predictions ,",
    "we have compared ` exact ' ( accurate up to double - precision ) direct numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation and compared with our approximate analytical solutions .",
    "the discrepancies between the exact and approximate solutions are relatively small as shown by fidelities in figures 24 .",
    "we have demonstrated that our system initially in vacuum state or single - photon fock states @xmath209 ( @xmath74 ) evolves into bell states .",
    "we have discussed the fragility of the entanglement of formation of the generated states due to the standard dissipation and dephasing in the two distinct master equation approaches .",
