    "in the next few years , the first generation of long baseline interferometric detectors of gravitational waves ( gw ) @xcite will be operational . among the most promising sources of gw , the compact binary inspirals and",
    "the periodic sources have been already studied for a long time ( see @xcite or @xcite for a review ) ; more recently , some analysis methods have been developed to look for gw bursts of short duration and unknown waveform which are the subject of this paper .",
    "type ii supernovae ( @xcite and references therein ) and the merging phase of binary compact star and/or black hole systems @xcite are the most common burst sources foreseen but others such as e.g. cosmic strings @xcite could also be considered promising .",
    "the lack of knowledge of such gw signals prevents from using the optimal ( wiener ) filtering method and requires sub - optimal ( i.e. less efficient yet robust ) filters ; various techniques have already been studying by different groups .",
    "the `` excess power statistics '' @xcite monitors the power of the detector output along the time and is shown to be optimal when minimal hypothesis ( signal duration and bandwidth are the only known quantities ) are taken into account @xcite .",
    "time - frequency methods have also been presented : the authors in @xcite use the wigner - wille distribution to transform time series into two - dimensional maps in which ridges are looked for by using the steger algorithm ; a student - like test on noise periodograms has been studied in order to detect non - stationary events @xcite . more generally , we have developed a set of filters able to be used as on - line triggers @xcite , the most promising being the `` alternative linear fit filter '' ( alf ) @xcite , which aims at detecting a nonzero slope in data windows .    as burst signals",
    "are poorly modelled , only an accurate knowledge of the detector behaviour could allow to properly separate a real gw from non - stationarities in a single antenna ; therefore , one will be more confident about the reality of a candidate event in case of a significant coincidence between several interferometers , or between an interferometer and other types of detector ( neutrinos , @xmath0-rays satellites ... ) . many studies in the literature",
    "assume such multi - detections as the starting point of the analysis and deal with the `` inverse problem '' , i.e. how to extract informations  source location in the sky , gw waveforms , astrophysical parameters  from these triggered data @xcite .",
    "in this article we will not address this question which will be the main topic of forthcoming papers aiming at developing coincidence strategies for the detection of bursts with a network of both gw antennas and detectors sensitive to other radiations such as neutrinos .",
    "simulations of massive star collapses @xcite give typical gw amplitudes too low to expect a likely detection of sources outside the galaxy ; more optimistic estimates have been computed recently for the merging phase of two neutron stars @xcite or a neutron star and a black hole @xcite , whose coalescences could be detected until 10 mpc given the planned sensitivity of the first generation of detectors . in both cases , as the gw amplitude is just above the noise level , the signal to noise ratios ( snr ) are nevertheless expected to be low , all the more that the wave amplitude detected in a given antenna depends on its location and orientation with respect to the source @xcite : when the source direction is not orthogonal to the detector plane , the response to the gw is not optimal and so the snr is decreased .",
    "therefore the feasibility and the efficiency of coincidences between interferometers currently under construction worldwide is an important question : are these coincidences likely or not ?",
    "this problem has attracted so far little attention in the literature whereas it should be the starting point of the study of coincidence strategies : a precise knowledge on how a network of detectors surveys the sky is essential in defining the best possible methods to analyse their data .",
    "this paper addresses this topic from a statistical point of view by performing monte - carlo simulations of the detection process in a network of antennas .",
    "after having described the model used in the computations , we briefly recall the structure of the beam pattern functions - describing the interaction between a gw and a detector - and extract from them some information on the accuracy with which a particular sky direction is surveyed by a given interferometer .",
    "we will use the celestial sphere coordinates , i.e. the right ascension @xmath1 and the declination @xmath2 to label sources .",
    "sky maps will be constructed to characterise the detection power of each antenna and any combination of them .",
    "next , we introduce a quantity independent of any detector , @xmath3 , characterising a gw strength ; the simulation results  detection probabilities for different configurations in the network : single antenna , twofold coincidence , threefold coincidence  are then presented either as function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on a sky map , or simply versus @xmath3 after averaging over all the sky directions .",
    "finally , the timing accuracy is strongly connected to the detection problem : reconstructing the source location in the sky or performing coincidences with other types of detectors ( @xmath0-rays , neutrinos ... ) requires a good knowledge of the gw event timing in the interferometer(s ) .",
    "therefore , we also present some results about the timing precision one can expect for typical burst detection before concluding .",
    "in this section we present the different hypothesis used in the monte - carlo simulations whose results are presented below : first about the network of detectors ; then we give some assumptions about the gw burst and the calibration of its amplitude ; finally , we detail the detection process itself .      each detector @xmath5 is described by a set of four angles : its latitude @xmath6 , its longitude @xmath7 , the angle between the two arms @xmath8 and an orientation angle @xmath9 defined as the angle between the local south direction and the bisecting line of the detector arms counted counterclockwise .",
    "the values of these angles can be found in table  i extracted from @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i : detector data , all angles given in degrees    the interferometer noise components are assumed to be white ( after whitening @xcite and applying line removal @xcite methods ) , gaussian , broadband , additive and uncorrelated ; lacking realistic sensitivities validated by measurements ,  these informations will appear when detector runs start  we also assume they all have same noise standard deviation @xmath10@xcite and sampling frequency @xmath11 .      as a gw signal , we use an one - parameter set of gaussian bursts @xmath12 where the width @xmath13 is taken between 0.1 ms and 10 ms and @xmath14 is a scaling factor .",
    "therefore , the maximum snr ( corresponding to an optimal detector orientation with respect to the source direction @xcite and by using wiener filtering ) , referred as @xmath3 in the following , is given by @xcite : @xmath15 by assuming a value for @xmath3 , it is straightforward to compute @xmath14 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) and so to characterise the amplitude of the gw burst independently of any detector .",
    "in addition to the two coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 previously introduced , a third variable is necessary to determine completely the gw : the polarisation angle @xmath16 , one of the euler angles describing the wave coordinate system in the tt gauge with respect to the celestial frame . in the simulations ,",
    "unless specified otherwise , the gw sources are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the sky ( @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 $ ] ) .    finally , one has to notice that the arrival time of the gw in the detectors is a priori not synchronised with the sampling which will cause some losses in snr and in timing accuracy for very narrow bursts .",
    "the detection method used is wiener filtering ",
    "correlation with the known signal itself  for sake of simplicity : it is an approximation of no consequence as an earlier paper @xcite showed that the one - dimensional parameter space @xmath20 $ ] can be covered by a discrete lattice of gaussian filters ensuring a detection with a mismatch snr loss lower than 1 % .",
    "the threshold value on the filter output is set to @xmath21 which corresponds to a false alarm rate of @xmath22 , i.e. 72 per hour for the virgo value of the sampling frequency @xmath11 .",
    "one claims a detection if the filter output overcomes the threshold at least once in the analysis window .",
    "decreasing the false alarm rate ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ... ) will not dramatically increase the threshold , so the results presented in the following remain essentially the same .",
    "in the frame associated to the gw ( wave direction being @xmath25 by convention ) , in the tt gauge , the spatial metric perturbation is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to the two independent wave polarisations . by assuming the detector size small compared to the reduced wavelength of the gw @xcite and by following the treatment presented e.g. in @xcite it is straightforward to show that the response @xmath29 of an interferometric detector to this wave is a linear combination of the two polarisations : @xmath30 the corresponding weighting factors are called beam pattern functions ; they have values in the range [ -1;1 ] depending on the longitude and the latitude of the detector location , as well as its orientation , the angle between the interferometer arms @xmath31",
    ", the sky coordinates @xmath4 of the source and the wave polarisation angle @xmath16 . still following the notations and",
    "the analysis of @xcite one can compute the general expression of the beam pattern functions : @xmath32 the factor @xmath33 recalls that the best response is achieved for detectors with orthogonal arms ( like for instance virgo and the two ligo interferometers ) ; the @xmath34 and @xmath35 factors depend neither on @xmath16 nor on @xmath31 and so @xmath36 appears like a rotation angle and @xmath33 like a scale factor for the beam pattern functions .    due to the earth",
    "proper rotational motion the sky is in apparent motion with a period equal to a mean sidereal day .",
    "therefore , the beam pattern functions associated to a source location ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) depend also on the ut time @xmath37 ; let us introduce the local sidereal time @xmath38 for a detector of longitude @xmath39 : @xmath40 @xmath41 is the greenwich sidereal time at 0h ut and the minus sign before @xmath39 comes from the fact that longitudes are counted positive westwards",
    ". then one can define the local hour angle of the source : @xmath42    extensive calculations yield to compute the complete expressions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( depending on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath43 , @xmath39 , @xmath0 and @xmath37 ) ; we recall them for sake of completeness even if they are completely equivalent to those presented in section 2.1 of @xcite ( see also references therein ) : @xmath44      the main interest of studying beam pattern functions is to characterise the sensitivity of an interferometric detector , given for different directions in the sky , independently of its noise curve .",
    "this can be done by performing a quadratic average of the beam pattern amplitude over the unknown polarisation angle @xmath16 .",
    "it leads to a @xmath16-independent quantity @xmath45 @xcite given by @xmath46\\ ] ]    we choose to present the variations of @xmath47 in a two - dimensional contour plot figure  the `` sky map ''  where any direction is located by a couple @xmath48\\times[-1;1]$ ] . for a given detector",
    ", @xmath49 depends not only on @xmath1 and @xmath2 but also on the time @xmath37 . for sake of simplicity , each sky map shown below in the paper is determined at the time @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 $ ] ; to have results at another time @xmath37 one can simply imagine the map on a cylinder whose axis is along the @xmath52 direction and to rotate it by @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] compares the sky maps of the @xmath16-averaged beam pattern function @xmath49 for the five interferometers currently in development in the world : virgo , the two ligo antennas , geo600 and tama300 . in each case , the @xmath49 averaged value over the whole sky is 0.42 and the rms is 0.16 ; each map presents 2 maxima corresponding to directions which are orthogonal to the detector plane and 4 minima ( direction of the bisector of the two arms and its three images by rotations of angles @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the detector plane ) included in a large `` valley '' where @xmath49 remains quite small .    to simplify the analysis presented in this paper we now consider only three of these antennas as this is the minimum number required in order to be able to reconstruct the source direction in the sky in case of a full coincidence .",
    "we keep the two ligo interferometers as they have been planned to work coherently by construction and as they have the same design sensitivities ; virgo and geo600 have almost identical @xmath49 sky map ( at least for the areas where the averaged beam pattern function is maximal ) and so keeping one of the two ( retaining virgo which is expected to have a sensitivity similar to ligo ) is enough to compute the main properties of an american - european network . finally , despite",
    "that tama300 sky map is different from the other ones , its expected sensitivity is too small  with respect to the other antennas previously mentioned  to help the network detection .",
    "so , in the following , the network chosen is made of three detectors : virgo ( v ) and the two ligo interferometers in hanford ( h ) and livingston ( l ) ; the selected antennas are those expected to achieve the best broadband sensitivities .",
    "nevertheless the results presented in this paper can be easily extended to accommodate additional interferometers into the network .",
    "the regions of maximum @xmath49 are rather close for the two ligo interferometers but quite different from those of virgo",
    ". therefore one can expect on one hand a good complementarity between the three interferometers for a single detection  a clear advantage to maximise sky coverage . on the other hand , the ability to perform coincidences between the 3 detectors",
    "is expected to be significantly reduced  at least for small snr values .      as mentioned before , the two - dimensional maps previously defined are also function of time .",
    "therefore , another way to present the information they contain is to average @xmath49 over one sidereal day ( and so over @xmath1 ) to keep only the dependence in the declination variable @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath57    figure [ figure2 ] presents the graphs of @xmath58 for the three detectors virgo , ligo hanford and ligo livingston .",
    "one can note that the vertical axis scale is zero - suppressed to enhance the variations which are in fact small ( @xmath59 ) around the mean value of 0.42 .",
    "due to the successive averages , these plots mainly depend on the detector s latitude which explains why virgo and ligo hanford curves are quite similar . to make this figure more concrete , vertical lines",
    "are given corresponding to the location of some centres of galaxies where gw sources are expected to be found : the galaxy , the magellanic clouds , m31 andromeda and m87 in the virgo cluster .",
    "for the galactic centre and m31 , the three detectors are roughly identical whereas livingston is better for m87 and virgo / hanford for the magellanic clouds .",
    "the detection process ( exceeding or not a threshold ) is not linear ; therefore , it can only be studied by using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "so , in the following , no a priori average on @xmath16 is performed ; we assume uniform distributions of sources in the sky which corresponds to the ranges of variables quoted in table ii .",
    "the results are twofold :    * detection efficiencies versus @xmath3 averaged over @xmath1 , @xmath52 and @xmath16 ; * detection sky maps , i.e. detection probability versus @xmath60 for a given @xmath3 , averaged on @xmath16 .    various configurations",
    "are studied , from a single interferometer to the search for full coincidences between virgo and the two ligo antennas .        as shown in section iii - a , the amplitude of the gw interacting with a detector has to be multiplied by the beam pattern function with respect to the ideal case ( optimal incidence and polarisation ) .",
    "therefore the signal to noise ratio is lowered by the same factor : let us call @xmath61 the product @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the beam pattern function .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] presents the detection efficiency as function of the real signal to noise ratio @xmath61 for a linear filter with a @xmath22 false alarm rate @xcite .",
    "the 50% efficiency is reached for @xmath64 and the detection is almost always successful for real snr higher than 7 ( efficiency higher than 98% ) . note that this curve obviously does not depend on the beam pattern .    adding the effect of the non optimal detector response gives graphs such as those shown on figure [ figure4 ] . for two values of @xmath3 - 10 and 20 - and a gaussian width of @xmath65 ms",
    ", one sees    * continuous line : the distribution of @xmath61 for @xmath3 constant ; this curve shape is only due to the beam pattern ; * dashed line : the fraction of events really detected , computed by including detector efficiency from figure [ figure3 ] .    from 0 to @xmath66 the distribution of @xmath61 is flat ; for higher values , it decreases monotonously up to the maximal signal to noise ratio . adding the noisy detection process",
    "considerably lowers the number of events detected at small real snr but keeps almost all those with @xmath67 . by comparing the number of detected events with the total number of events generated by the monte - carlo simulation",
    ", one can compute the detection efficiencies : 32% for @xmath68 , 66% for @xmath69 .    simulating the real detection process",
    ", one obtains figure [ figure5 ] which shows the detection probability versus @xmath3 for different values of @xmath13 . as expected , this probability only depends on the signal to noise ratio which is the relevant variable in signal analysis . due to the beam pattern functions ,",
    "the detection efficiency remains low even for large optimal signal to noise ratios : with @xmath3=10 the detection efficiency is only about 30% , it reaches 50% for @xmath3=14 and 90% for  unlikely  high values .    from those graphs",
    "one can conclude that including beam pattern functions in data analysis has major consequences on detection efficiency by reducing greatly the detection probability even for high @xmath3 .",
    "the previous results deal with averaged efficiencies around the whole sky ; of course , the detection probability depends on the relative position of the source with respect to the interferometer .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] presents the detection efficiencies versus @xmath60 for three values of @xmath3 .",
    "one can note that these three maps are highly correlated with the upper graph of figure [ figure1 ] : @xmath49 is thus a good  and easily computable  estimator of the detection probability in a given sky direction , especially in the low snr region where are likely to be located the first detected events .    in the first case",
    "@xmath70 detections are possible for incoming wave directions almost orthogonal to the detector plane reducing considerably the detection rate : a large fraction of the sky remains invisible . for @xmath71 and @xmath69 ,",
    "the detection probability is more uniform over the sky ; the four minima are still there but they cover now narrower regions whose areas decrease as @xmath3 increases . in the last case , there are simply blind islands among regions where the detection efficiency is larger than 60% .",
    "converting the results of these maps into fractions of sky with given detection probability leads to figure [ figure14 ] .",
    "one can note that especially at large @xmath3 the fraction of sky covered decreases first slowly when the detection probability level increases and then more rapidly after some corner value .",
    "the reason for this evolution can be understood by looking at figure [ figure6 ] , considering the large part of the sky where the efficiency is large and almost constant .",
    "the detection probability is higher than 30% in 40% of the sky for @xmath3=10 ; for @xmath3=15 it is more than 50% in half of the sky and it is almost 60% in 70% of the sky for @xmath3=20 .",
    "therefore detections are likely for high maximal snr @xmath3 in any direction but even for @xmath3=20 , the efficiency never reaches 90% .      this analysis can also be done for the two ligo interferometers ; as expected , averaging the detection probability over the whole sky while taking @xmath3 constant gives exactly the same results . to compare the three interferometers , we simply average on @xmath1 over one day .",
    "so , figure [ figure12 ] shows the daily averaged detection efficiencies for each of the detectors and for three different values of the maximal signal to noise ratio , @xmath68 , 15 and 20 .",
    "as on figure [ figure2 ] , the dashed vertical lines indicate some locations of galaxy centres .",
    "one can note that the detection probability is shifted to higher values for increasing @xmath3 ; nevertheless , the curve shapes do not change too much and remain close to those shown on figure [ figure2 ] for the averaged beam pattern functions : ligo livingston has the best results for small values of @xmath72 whereas ligo hanford and virgo are more efficient for large @xmath72 .",
    "but there remain some differences between the two figures so that one should refine our previous statement : computing averaged beam pattern maps allow to have an idea of the detection probability in different sky areas but it is necessary to perform monte - carlo simulations including the detection process to compute the correct probabilities .",
    "as we already checked that detection depends only on signal to noise ratio and not on the signal shape itself , we choose @xmath13=1 ms  a typical burst duration for the gaussian waveform we use  in the following . in this section , we study the complementarity of the antennas , i.e. how their sky coverages complement each other , either for a single detection  the `` or '' strategy  or for different types of coincidences  the `` and '' strategies .",
    "figure [ figure7 ] shows the detection probability versus @xmath3 for different configurations of detectors in the network ; the curve already presented on figure [ figure5 ]  single detector efficiency  is simply recalled for comparison .",
    "the continuous line shows the efficiency of detection in any single detector , i.e. the probability for a detection in at least one of the three interferometers .",
    "network detection potential is clearly better than for a single antenna and the smaller the @xmath3 the higher the difference : more than twice more detections for @xmath73 , more than 1.5 below @xmath3=17 .",
    "the 50% efficiency is reached at @xmath3=8 and for @xmath74 the probability is higher than 85% on average , corresponding to a likely detection in most parts of the sky .    on the same figure , one can also see the curve corresponding to a coincidence detection in at least two detectors among three ( `` or '' of twofold coincidences ) . for small values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the twofold coincidence probability remains lower than the detection efficiency in a single interferometer but above @xmath75  where the two compared probabilities are about equal to 50%  it becomes more likely to trigger in two detectors .",
    "finally , the probability of full coincidence in the three interferometers of the network is considered .",
    "it is quite small for @xmath76 and reaches useful levels only for very high maximal signal to noise ratios : the 50% efficiency is reached only for @xmath77 .    to conclude this section , figure [ figure8 ] presents the detection probability in at least one interferometer of the network ( `` or '' strategy ) as a function of the source location in the sky .",
    "the maximal signal to noise ratio is set to 10 and so this graph can be compared with the top map of figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "the better efficiency achieved ( about double , 67% in average instead of 34% ) indeed corresponds to a more homogeneous detection probability over the sky .    in this section and the next more details",
    "are given on the coincidence probabilities as simultaneous detection in different interferometers will ensure much higher confidence levels for candidate events .",
    "figure [ figure9 ] shows the detection efficiencies for the three combinations of two detectors : virgo - hanford , virgo - livingston and hanford - livingston . by construction ,",
    "the association between the two ligo antennas is always more efficient than virgo and one of the ligo interferometers .",
    "nevertheless , the detection efficiency remains small : it is only 20% for the two ligo antennas with @xmath3=10 .",
    "one can therefore conclude that simultaneous detection in two given detectors is unlikely for weak gw signals and becomes likely ( @xmath78 ) only for @xmath79 .",
    "the last graph of this figure presents the twofold coincidence detection probability in the network , when triggering occurs in at least two interferometers among the three . for the smallest values of @xmath3",
    "it corresponds to the two ligo antennas case but then it increases more quickly : already at @xmath68 this probability is about 50% larger than for the two ligo interferometers .",
    "as the coincidence detection efficiency remains low for small values of @xmath3 it is instructive to investigate how it is distributed over the sky .",
    "figure [ figure10 ] presents the detection efficiency of twofold coincidences versus @xmath60 for @xmath68  a likely value for the snr of the first gw events detected .",
    "the three first maps are for the different twofold coincidences in the network while the fourth shows the detection probability in at least two detectors .",
    "one can see that despite the differences in the colour code the areas of high coincident detection probability are of small extent for the three configurations . in the last graph these regions",
    "are connected and the detection efficiency is higher , but nevertheless a major part of the sky remains invisible for the two - detector coincidences for low  but unfortunately realistic  @xmath3 values .      from the conclusions of the previous sections it is clear that a simultaneous detection in the three detectors is not likely unless the optimal signal to noise ratio is large .",
    "therefore it appears difficult to reconstruct gw astrophysical informations from a source at the expected sensitivity level provided by the first generation of detectors .",
    "nevertheless , figure [ figure11 ] shows the detection efficiency sky maps for values of the maximal signal to noise ratio of 10 , 15 and 20 respectively .",
    "in the first case ( @xmath68 ) , non zero efficiency is concentrated in two small regions corresponding to the common visible areas of the ligo - virgo , but even in these parts of the sky the detection efficiency is lower than 30% . in the two other cases ,",
    "the distribution is more uniform with unfortunately some large areas which remain invisible  though they decrease as @xmath3 increases .",
    "determination of the absolute timing of a detected gw burst is an important question .",
    "firstly , coincidences in different antennas require time correlations between the respective detected signals .",
    "secondly , the reconstruction of the source location is only based on arrival times detected in three detectors located in different places on earth and the better the precision , the smaller the angular error box in the sky .",
    "thirdly , coincidences with other types of detectors will also be based on time correlations .",
    "an application of the later using neutrinos can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath80 be the time difference between the actual arrival time of the gw on the detector @xmath81 and the reconstructed time @xmath82 corresponding to a detection with a given filter in the interferometer s output , when the snr is maximal .",
    "@xmath83    generally speaking , there could be an offset between @xmath81 and @xmath82 specific to the filter algorithm but here we assume it to be zero as would be obtained with matched filtering whose output peaks when the signal and the filter overlap@xcite .",
    "then the only significant parameter is the rms of the distribution @xmath84 .",
    "a priori @xmath80 can be split into two parts :    * @xmath85 due to the discrete data sampling of the experiments . for a signal of characteristic duration @xmath86",
    "it is completely negligible as it is well approximated by an uniform distribution in the range @xmath87 $ ] whose standard deviation is @xmath88 ms e.g. for virgo . but for signals of small duration it can become significant by randomly dropping high amplitude parts of the gw whose consequence would be to trigger off maximum ( or to loose the event ) . *",
    "@xmath89 : if the gw signal is embedded in detector noise , the precise location of the output highest value will depend on the actual noise time series ; one expects this component to dominate for large @xmath13 . from dimensional analysis",
    "it is clear that @xmath80 must be proportional to @xmath13 and so it is convenient to use the dimensionless quantity @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ figure13 ] shows the normalised rms @xmath91 as a function of @xmath3 for different values of the gaussian width @xmath13 .",
    "apart from the case with @xmath92 ms which is sensitive to the finite sampling frequency as previously mentioned , all the other curves are identical .    from the data analysis point of view",
    ", it is mandatory to link the timing error with a measured quantity , the filter output @xmath93 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath84 on this variable for @xmath13 values insensitive to the sampling rate can be represented by    @xmath94    the validity range of this equation is @xmath95 and the filter output @xmath96 , as shown on figure [ figure15 ] for a particular case , @xmath65 ms and @xmath69 : the fit curve and the real one are in good agreement from @xmath97 .    for @xmath65",
    "ms and a filter maximal output of about 10 , one has @xmath98 ms which is well below the millisecond , the minimum level of precision suitable for coincidences with for instance neutrino detectors @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the basic aspects of burst coincidence detection in a network of three gravitational wave antennas : virgo , ligo hanford and ligo livingston .",
    "it does not focus on the signal parameter reconstruction ",
    "the inverse problem  but rather on studying the coincidence detection probability to see whether this kind of event is likely or not . in this respect ,",
    "the results obtained are somewhat disappointing : the detection probability in a given interferometer is strongly reduced by the beam pattern functions  on the average only about 40% .",
    "we also show that there is a good complementarity between virgo and the two ligo interferometers for detection ( the or strategy efficiency is higher than 50% for an optimal signal to noise ratio @xmath99 ) , but coincidences are very unlikely for weak signals .",
    "concerning twofold coincidences , the two ligo antennas configuration has a much better detection efficiency compared to virgo with one of the ligo interferometers ( a factor of two larger for @xmath68 ) . nevertheless , adding virgo and looking for any twofold coincidences allows the region of likely detection to be significally extended and the efficiency to be correspondingly increased : a 50% enhancement is obtained for @xmath68 , leading to a value averaged over the sky slightly higher than 30% ) .",
    "finally , threefold coincidences between detectors are quite unlikely below the value @xmath77 where the 50% efficiency is reached .",
    "as far as timing is concerned , the situation is quite satisfactory : monte - carlo simulations show that the rms timing can remain below 1 ms even for low values of @xmath3 , which is an interesting point for coincidence with other kind of detectors .",
    "even if the detection itself remains unlikely , the timing will be accurate enough if the gw is seen by the detectors .",
    "the basic aspects covered in this paper about beam pattern functions and timing accuracy apply equally well to all transient sources whose characteristic times are much shorter than a day ; in particular , this is the case for the coalescing binary signals which are expected to last from one second to a few minutes in the detector bandwidths .",
    "so coincidence analysis of binary inspirals will face the same detection efficiency problem as discussed for the bursts .",
    "apart from this inescapable fact the situation of the data analysis is different here since the known binary signals can be searched for through matched filtering .",
    "this opens the possibility of `` coherent '' rather than `` coincidence '' analyses , as proposed in @xcite , which are shown @xcite to give better results than a simple coincidence analysis ; thus , this method may compensate for part of the geometric effects presented in this paper by using in an optimal way all the information available in the detectors .",
    "this improvement is made at the cost of a large increase in computing power since the source sky coordinates have to be included in the template definition .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that it is sub - optimal , coincidence analysis may be the only available tool in the first years of operation of the interferometers , even for binaries and especially for poorly modelled sources such as gw bursts .",
    "* if the detector understanding is high enough to allow a proper elimination of non - stationary noise events , a burst detection is quite likely in at least one interferometer of the network since they cover the sky in a complementary way . extending the number of sensitive antennas",
    "would further improve the detection efficiency .",
    "this situation is nevertheless not likely to arise in the first periods of data taking ; it could even then be hopeless if the interferometer noise is not gaussian . however , this strategy is well - adapted to coincidences with non - gw detectors if they have a negligible false alarm rate @xcite ; * gw detection will in general require coincidences between interferometers",
    ". they may not be very frequent unless improvements are performed in the detector noise levels .",
    "nevertheless specific strategies must be devised in order to maximise sky coverage and detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this article give an overview of the gw burst detectability in a network of antennas focusing only on the detection efficiency .",
    "to go beyond , it is necessary to take into account the corresponding false alarm rates and to compare all the available associations of detectors sensitive to gw or other types of radiation such as neutrinos .",
    "forthcoming papers will deal with these questions and also present new ideas about the `` inverse problem '' @xcite .",
