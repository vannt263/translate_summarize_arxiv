    "single - molecule experiments deliver previously unprecedented insights into kinetics and thermodynamics of biophysical and biochemical processes @xcite .",
    "one class of these experiments comprises unfolding and folding of dna ( or other biomolecules ) under application of mechanical forces by optical or magnetic tweezers , or an atomic force microscope @xcite .",
    "an important aim of these studies is to obtain information on free energy differences ( feds ) between folded and unfolded states , or , more generally , on the free energy landscape ( fel ) characterising both the levels of stable as well as metastable , partly unfolded states and the energy barriers in between them .",
    "equilibrium methods are the easiest way to determine feds . in these the boltzmann statistics",
    "is applied to the fraction of residence times of the states at different values of the control parameters @xcite . however , for many molecules the barriers between states turn out to be so large that an equilibrium is not achieved within the available experimental time window @xcite .    an intriguing way to measure feds from out - of - equilibrium measurements",
    "is made possible by utilising detailed and integral work fluctuation theorems @xcite , as the crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite , or its integral counterpart , the jarzynski equality @xcite .",
    "analogous to the boltzmann distribution in equilibrium , these theorems hold true in an universal way independent of microscopic details of the molecule and its unfolding / folding dynamics . work in the fluctuation theorems refers to the thermodynamic work under a certain driving protocol @xmath0 of control variables during a time interval @xmath1 $ ] , as , for example , pulling a molecule with a force @xmath2 .",
    "because of the strong fluctuations in single molecule experiments , work values @xmath3 become stochastic variables with a distribution @xmath4 .",
    "the crooks theorem states that work distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a protocol @xmath0 and the associated reversed protocol @xmath6 , respectively , are related according to @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the difference in ( equilibrium ) free energies @xmath9 of the molecule in the macrostates specified by the control variables @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the thermal energy . in cases where the crooks theorem @xcite can not be used ,",
    "e.  g. , because the work for the reverse process can not be obtained with sufficient statistics , the jarzynski equality offers an alternative way to the fed .",
    "this theorem states that @xmath12 @xcite and has been applied successfully in various cases @xcite . in general",
    ", however , the application of the jarzynski equality turns out to be difficult , because @xmath13 is dominated by rare trajectories with work values @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a possible solution is to extend measured histograms of ( typical ) work values to the tail regime @xmath15 by fitting to theoretical predictions . to this end",
    ", some generic behaviour in the tail regime needs to be assumed and attempts have been made recently in this direction @xcite . even under some assumption of the functional form of the tail , the extraction of reliable free energy estimates from the measured data requires care , because one needs to correctly take into account the dependence of biasing effects on the number of measurements ( single unfolding trajectories ) @xcite .",
    "if the statistics is not sufficient to allow reasonable application of the nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems , an alternative route for determining the fed , and more generally , the fel , is to analyse the kinetics of unfolding and/or folding , and to compare it with predictions from theories .",
    "this requires to introduce parameters that are specific for the molecule under investigation . for example , it was shown @xcite that one can extract the fel out of first rupture force distributions . by considering a two - state dna folder these distributions for both the unfolding and folding process are connected to the distributions of the survival probabilities in the folded and unfolded state . in the case of constant loading / unloading rates ,",
    "a clever representation @xcite of the survival probabilities allows one to determine energetic barriers and the fed between the two states .",
    "it is clear that such methods heavily rely on a good theoretical description of the kinetics of dna unfolding and folding .",
    "these are commonly based on coarse - grained approaches , where molecular states are specified by the number @xmath16 of open base pairs ( bps ) .",
    "models have been established in the past @xcite that faithfully describe the free energies of these states and their variation with an externally applied force @xmath17 in terms of a fel @xmath18 .",
    "an important task is to optimise parameters in such models by suitable measurements , and to determine their variation under change of the environment , such as salt concentration , ph value or temperature of the solvent .",
    "so far analytical treatments concentrated on two - state folders . in experiments",
    "often long sequences are considered which exhibit many minima in the fel associated with partly unfolded states .",
    "an advantage of these sequences is that one unfolding / folding process involves many transitions , each of them giving information on the fel . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical treatments of the unfolding and folding kinetics of multistate folders are difficult because each transition between successive minima is characterised by distinct barriers and energy differences between the involved states .",
    "it is thus useful to consider periodic dna sequences where transitions between states are characterised by the same energetic parameters . in this work we will model the unfolding kinetics of such periodic dna sequences and investigate whether it is possible to obtain reliable information on the fel based on a small number of unfolding trajectories . using standard modelling , we first show that simple regular fels can be obtained for periodic sequences , which keep their characteristics over a wide range of pulling forces .",
    "kmc simulations are then applied to generate unfolding trajectories for these sequences , as surrogate for experimental ones . by fitting survival and persistence probabilities obtained from these trajectories to analytical results",
    ", we demonstrate that already about 300 trajectories can give good estimates of fel parameters .",
    "in a coarse - grained approach , unfolding of dna ( and other molecules ) is often described by thermally activated transitions between minima of a fel @xmath18 , which is expressed as a function of the number @xmath16 of sequentially opened bps and the applied stretching force @xmath17 .",
    "it can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath19 where the force - independent  formation  part @xmath20 quantifies the free energy release upon breaking of @xmath16 bps , and the part @xmath21 describes the energetic preference of unfolded states for larger @xmath17 ; @xmath22 is the length of the unfolded single - stranded ( ss ) part .",
    "the force - dependent  stretching ",
    "part @xmath23 takes into account the decrease of entropy of the ssdna when increasing the end - to - end distances of the unfolded parts @xcite .",
    "models borrowed from polymer physics are commonly used to specify @xmath23 . for the most prominent examples , the freely jointed chain ( fjc ) @xcite and the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model @xcite , we give details in [ sec : fel_app ] .",
    "for @xmath20 we use the nearest neighbour ( nn ) model @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the interaction energy between adjacent bases ( see [ sec : fel_app ] for an example ) .",
    "this model has been applied successfully in various experiments @xcite , and its parameters have been continuously improved .",
    "we take the ones recently reported in @xcite with the parameter values listed in the table  [ tab : nnbp ] in [ sec : fel_app ] .    at zero force ,",
    "the free energy @xmath26 of long unbranched hairpin molecules without any additional structures such as , e.  g. , interior loops , increases monotonically with @xmath16 , with varying local rise @xmath27 . considering unzipping experiments with a constant loading rate @xmath28 , corresponding to a force increasing linearly with time ,",
    "@xmath29 the fel gets tilted and local minima (  states  ) develop at values of @xmath16 , where @xmath30 changes significantly , i.  e.  where @xmath31 and @xmath32 differ strongly .",
    "once the tilting is large enough that the level of these minima becomes comparable to the energy of the completely folded state , thermally activated transitions from one minimum to the next drive the molecule into the unfolded state . in general ,",
    "each of these transitions is characterised by distinct forward and backward barriers , which also evolve differently in time .",
    "this implies that theoretical treatments become increasingly difficult with larger number of states .    with the goal to make a theoretical treatment of the kinetics tractable",
    ", we are looking for periodic sequences , where the forward and backward barriers decrease linearly with force and where the levels of the states decrease linearly with @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 denotes the particular @xmath16 values of the states @xmath35 . to be specific ,",
    "we write for the forward barriers @xmath36 , the backward barriers @xmath37 , and the state free energies @xmath38 : @xmath39 because @xmath40 , it holds @xmath41 and @xmath42 , that means the landscape is specified by four independent parameters .",
    "it is sufficient that equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) are obeyed in the range where the energy levels start to become comparable to the one of the folded state , that means when for the first time transitions can take place .",
    "whether , on the basis of equation  ( [ eq : g ] ) , periodic dna sequences satisfying equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) can be found will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we first analyse unbranched dna hairpin molecules that have periodic bp sequences without interior loops . for these molecules , equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] )",
    "can be fulfilled over a sufficiently wide force range if the periodicity length @xmath43 of the units is small enough .",
    "it turns out that the minima are not very pronounced and the barriers are just a few multiples of the thermal energy @xmath44 .",
    "accordingly , feds of these sequences should be measurable also from equilibrium occupancy statistics @xcite .",
    "when considering interior loops attached to the basic units , the requirements imposed by equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) can be well fulfilled with typically high barriers between the minima .",
    "additional parameters specifying the change of the fel by the interior loops @xcite then enter the description .",
    "we notice that they are less accurate than those defining the bp interactions @xcite ( see the table  [ tab : nnbp ] in app .",
    "[ sec : fel_app ] ) .",
    "a double - stranded ( ds ) dna with periodicity length @xmath45  bps and an arbitrarily chosen sequence in the period is sketched in figure  [ fig : periodic_structure ] .",
    "the bases are coloured as follows : adenine ( white ) , cytosine ( orange ) , guanine ( red ) and thymine ( black ) . ]",
    "such hairpin molecules can , in principle , be branched or form other structural elements . to exclude such features we rely on folding predictions of the program mfold @xcite .",
    "fels for unbranched hairpin molecules , calculated according to equations  ( [ eq : g ] ) and ( [ eq : gform ] ) , in general do not satisfy the requirements in equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) .",
    "starting from the folded state , minima and barriers first form regularly in the landscape when @xmath17 is increased up to a certain value .",
    "however , by further increasing @xmath17 , in between them new minima and barriers can form .",
    "this means that the overall structure of the regular landscape is not stable , but one regular type goes over to another one .",
    "the  new barrier effect  leads to force intervals where equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) are satisfied , but jumps of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath46 appear when going from one interval to the next one .",
    "another possibility that the regular structure gets modified is that the positions of minima and saddle points are shifting .",
    "this  shifting effect",
    " leads to force intervals where equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) are satisfied , but jumps in the slopes @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 appear when going from one interval to the next . for long periodicity lengths ,",
    "the new barrier effect is difficult to avoid , even for sequences that are specifically optimised in order to circumvent the problem . on the other hand , for sufficiently short periodicity lengths ( @xmath50 ) ,",
    "the new barrier effect is usually not occurring .",
    "the shifting effect , however , affects the regular behaviour also for small periodicity lengths . to avoid it",
    ", sequences have to be optimised .",
    "an optimisation among all @xmath51 sequences for @xmath45  bps with respect to equations  ( [ eq : fel_features_a])-([eq : fel_features_c ] ) gives the smallest regression coefficients for the sequence consisting of tgcaa [ see figure  [ fig : rank11_felparameters ] ] , which we refer to as sequence i. the intercept and slope parameters of the linear functions for this sequence i are given in the table  [ tab : parameters ] .",

    "these probabilities can be sampled from the trajectories , and theoretical calculations give rather simple expressions for them , allowing one to determine the fel parameters by a nonlinear fitting procedure .",
    "we demonstrated that already about 300 unfolding trajectories are sufficient to obtain good parameter estimates .",
    "best results are obtained if the loading rate is suitably chosen , such that the long - time limit of @xmath93 is neither close to zero nor close to one . for small barriers between states of the order of a few @xmath44",
    ", such rates may become too high to be realisable in experiment .    from a theoretical point of view , the possibility to generate simple functional forms of fels as function of the number @xmath16 of open base pairs and applied force @xmath17 provides an interesting basis for future studies , where exact results could be obtained for kinetic and energetic properties .",
    "analytical results for work distributions will be of particular interest to gain a deeper understanding of tail regimes .    with respect to applications ,",
