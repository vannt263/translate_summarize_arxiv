    "in the mathematical modelling of epidemic diseases , the fate of the disease can be predicted through the uninfected and infected equilibria and their stability .",
    "the basic reproduction number , @xmath1 , represents the average number of new infectives introduced into an otherwise disease - free system by a single infective , and is usually chosen as the bifurcation parameter . if the model involves a forward bifurcation , the uninfected equilibrium is in general globally asymptotically stable  @xcite , characterized by @xmath2 , and infection fails to invade in this parameter regime .",
    "the threshold @xmath3 defines a bifurcation ( or critical ) point , and when @xmath4 , a stable infected equilibrium emerges .",
    "this simple exchange of stability implies that complex dynamics will not typically occur in forward bifurcation .",
    "in contrast , backward bifurcation describes a scenario in which a turning point of the infected equilibrium exists in a region where all state variables are positive , and @xmath5 .",
    "this induces multiple infected equilibria , disrupting the global stability of the uninfected equilibrium .",
    "multiple stable states ( e.g. , bistability ) may likewise appear in @xcite , and yu et al .",
    "( submitted for publication ) . instead of converging globally to the uninfected equilibrium when",
    "@xmath2 , the solution may approach an infected equilibrium , depending on initial conditions .    in practice ,",
    "the phenomenon of backward bifurcation gives rise to new challenges in disease control , since reducing @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is not sufficient to eliminate the disease @xcite .",
    "instead , @xmath1 needs to be reduced past the critical value given by the turning point  @xcite , since the result in yu et al .",
    "( submitted for publication ) shows that the uninfected equilibrium in backward bifurcation is globally stable if @xmath1 is smaller than the turning point .",
    "furthermore , an infective outbreak or catastrophe may occur if @xmath1 increases and crosses unity , while the upper branch of the infected equilibrium remains stable @xcite .",
    "in addition , oscillation or even recurrent phenomena may occur if uninfected and infected equilibria coexist in a parameter range , and both are unstable  @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted oscillations arising from backward bifurcation , and @xcite pointed out that the unstable infected equilibrium `` commonly arises from hopf bifurcation '' , but did not demonstrate oscillations .",
    "several mechanisms leading to backward bifurcation have been proposed , such as partially effective vaccination programs @xcite , educational influence on infectives behavior  @xcite , the interaction among multi - group models @xcite and multiple stages of infection  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we will investigate the emergence of backward bifurcation in three simple disease models which have arisen in the study of epidemiology , in - host disease and autoimmunity . in each case",
    ", we find that backward bifurcation facilitates the emergence of hopf bifurcation(s ) , and hopf bifurcation in turn underlies a range of complex and clinically relevant dynamical behaviors .",
    "a central theme in our investigation is the role of the incidence rate in the epidemiological and in - host disease models .",
    "the incidence rate describes the speed at which an infection spreads ; it denotes the rate at which susceptibles become infectives . under the assumptions of mass action",
    ", incidence is written as the product of the infection force and the number of susceptibles .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the susceptible and infective population size respectively , a bilinear incidence rate , @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is a positive constant ) , is linear in each of the state variables : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the possibility of saturation effects @xcite has motivated the modification of the incidence rate from bilinear to nonlinear .",
    "saturation occurs when the number of susceptible contacts per infective drops off as the proportion of infectives increases .",
    "a nonlinear incidence rate , therefore , typically increases sublinearly with respect to the growth of the infective population , and may finally reach an upper bound .",
    "the development of nonlinear incidence was first investigated in the form @xmath10 , where @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are positive constants @xcite .",
    "other forms of nonlinear incidence have also been analysed , such as @xmath13  @xcite , and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "since the nonlinear incidence functions described above were often developed to incorporate saturation effects , these functions are typically concave at realistic parameter values .",
    "@xcite used this feature to derive general results for disease models with concave incidence .",
    "they proved that standard epidemiological models with concave incidence functions will have globally asymptotically stable uninfected and infected equilibria for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .    more specifically , denoting the incidence rate function as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the population size",
    ", the classical sirs model considered in  @xcite takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represent the birth / death rate , the recovery rate and the loss of immunity rate , respectively . when @xmath21 , system  ( [ paper3_eq1 ] ) becomes an sir model .",
    "assuming that the total population size is constant , that is , @xmath22 , the above system can be reduced to a 2-dimensional model : @xmath23 moreover , it is assumed in  @xcite that the function @xmath15 , denoting the incidence rate , satisfies the following three conditions :    @xmath24 & \\frac{\\partial f(s,\\,i,\\,n)}{\\partial i}>0 , \\quad   \\frac{\\partial f(s,\\,i,\\,n)}{\\partial s}>0 , \\quad \\forall \\ ; s,\\,i > 0   \\label{paper3_eq3b}\\\\[0.5ex ] & \\frac{\\partial^2 f(s,\\,i,\\,n)}{\\partial i^2}\\leq 0 , \\quad \\forall \\ ; s,\\,i > 0 \\label{paper3_eq3c}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ paper3_eq3 ]    the first two conditions ( [ paper3_eq3a ] ) and ( [ paper3_eq3b ] ) are necessary to ensure that the model is biologically meaningful .",
    "the third condition  ( [ paper3_eq3c ] ) implies that the incidence rate @xmath15 , is concave with respect to the number of infectives .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath25 evaluated at the uninfected equilibrium is proportional to the basic reproduction number @xmath1 @xcite , and thus should be a positive finite number @xcite .",
    "korobeinikov and maini first considered @xmath26 , or @xmath27 , and showed that forward bifurcation occurs in model  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) with a concave incidence function .",
    "they further proved that the uninfected equilibrium @xmath28 and the infected equilibrium @xmath29 are globally asymptotically stable , when @xmath30 and @xmath4 , respectively .    in the sections to follow , for an incidence rate function @xmath31 , satisfying ( [ paper3_eq3a ] ) and ( [ paper3_eq3b ] )",
    ", we define @xmath31 as concave , if it satisfies  ( [ paper3_eq3c ] ) ; as convex , if @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; and as convex - concave , if there exist @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "several models closely related to ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) have been previously studied .",
    "for example , by adding a saturating treatment term to model  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) with a concave incidence rate , @xcite showed that this model may yield backward bifurcation and hopf bifurcation . with an even more sophisticated nonlinear incidence rate function : @xmath13 , where @xmath43 , @xcite proved that a reduced 2-dimensional sirs model could exhibit backward bifurcation , hopf bifurcation , and even bogdanov - takens bifurcation and homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "although the choice of @xmath43 was not motivated by a specific physical process , this important result demonstrates that a nonlinear incidence rate can induce backward bifurcation , and further generate complex dynamics in a simple disease model .",
    "one of the focal points of our study will be a convex incidence function which arose in a 4-dimensional hiv antioxidant therapy model  @xcite .",
    "in this model , the infectivity of infected cells was proposed to be an increasing function of the density of reactive oxygen species , which themselves increase as the infection progresses . in  @xcite , meaningful parameter values were carefully chosen by data fitting to both experimental and clinical results . in this parameter regime",
    ", the model was observed to capture the phenomenon of viral blips , that is , long periods of undetectable viral load punctuated by brief episodes of high viral load .",
    "viral blips have been observed clinically in hiv patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy  @xcite , and have received much attention in the research literature , both by experimentalists  @xcite and mathematicians  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not thoroughly understood  @xcite .",
    "we recently re - examined the model developed in  @xcite , with the aim of providing new insight into the mechanism of hiv viral blips  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the dynamics of the slow manifold of this model , we reduced the dimension of the 4-dimensional model by using quasi - steady state assumptions .",
    "after a further generalization and parameter rescaling process , a 2-dimensional in - host hiv model  @xcite was obtained , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the concentrations of the uninfected and infected cells respectively .",
    "the constant influx rate and the death rate of @xmath46 have been scaled to @xmath47 .",
    "the death rate of @xmath45 is @xmath48 .",
    "the 2-dimensional infection model above  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) , reduced from the 4-dimensional hiv model  @xcite , preserves the viral blips observed in the hiv model .",
    "importantly , system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) is equivalent to the sir model  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) , except that the incidence function is convex , as we will show in section  [ hopfconvex ] .",
    "this equivalence can be demonstrated if we set @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case ,",
    "system  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) is rescaled to @xmath54 which takes the same form as system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , although system  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) arises in epidemiology and system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) was derived as an in - host model , they are mathematically equivalent in this sense",
    ". we will refer to both systems  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) and ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) as infection models .    in previous work  @xcite",
    ", we analyze the recurrent behavior which emerges in system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) in some detail .",
    "recurrence is a particular form of oscillatory behavior characterized by long periods of time close to the uninfected equilibrium , punctuated by brief episodes of high infection  @xcite .",
    "thus hiv viral blips are an example of recurrent behavior , but recurrence is a more general feature of many diseases  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the increasing and saturating infectivity function of system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) is critical to the emergence of recurrent behaviour .",
    "this form of an infectivity function corresponds to a convex incidence rate function in the associated 2-dimensional infection model  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) , and can likewise induce recurrence in this model .",
    "convex incidence has been previously suggested to model ` cooperation effects ' in epidemiology  @xcite , or cooperative phenomena in reactions between enzyme and substrate , as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we study two 2-dimensional infection models , both closely related to system  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) .",
    "we show that system  ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) with either ( a ) a concave incidence rate and saturating treatment term or ( b ) a convex incidence rate as shown in system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) , can exhibit backward bifurcation ; we then identify the necessary terms in the system equations which cause this phenomenon . in section 3 , we demonstrate that in both models , backward bifurcation increases the likelihood of a hopf bifurcation on the upper branch of the infected equilibrium .",
    "studying system  ( [ paper3_eq4 ] ) in greater detail , we illustrate how the location of the hopf bifurcations and their directions ( supercritical or subcritical ) , determine the possible dynamical behaviors , concluding that backward bifurcation facilitates hopf bifurcation(s ) , which then underly the rich behaviours observed in these models . in section 4 , we explore backward bifurcation further , presenting an autoimmune disease model which exhibits negative backward bifurcation , that is , a bifurcation for which the turning point when @xmath5 is located in a region where one or more state variables is negative .",
    "although this bifurcation introduces two branches of the infected equilibrium , we demonstrate that , in the biologically feasible area , only forward bifurcation exists in this model .",
    "we then present a modification to this autoimmune model , motivated by the recent discovery of a new cell type , which generates a negative backward bifurcation and hopf bifurcation , and allows recurrent behavior to emerge .",
    "a conclusion is drawn in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we study backward bifurcation in two 2-dimensional infection models .",
    "in particular , we explore the essential terms and parameter relations which are needed to generate backward bifurcation .",
    "furthermore , we examine the convex incidence rate , and reveal its underlying role in determining the emergence of backward bifurcation .      first , we consider the sir model with concave incidence , described by the following equations  @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath56 denote the number of susceptible , infective , and recovered individuals , respectively ; @xmath57 is the constant recruitment rate of susceptibles ; @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 represent the rates of natural death , recovery , and the disease - induced mortality , respectively .",
    "note that the function @xmath61 is an incidence rate of the form @xmath62",
    "@xcite , when @xmath63 . here , @xmath9 is the infection rate , and @xmath64 measures the inhibition effect .",
    "since the variable @xmath56 is not involved in the first two equations , system  ( [ paper3_eq5 ] ) can be reduced to a 2-dimensional model as @xmath65 in  @xcite , an additional assumption regarding limited medical treatment resources is introduced to the above model , leading to a model with a saturating treatment term , given by @xmath66 where the real , positive parameter @xmath20 represents the maximal medical resources per unit time , and the real , positive parameter @xmath67 is the half - saturation constant . for simplicity ,",
    "let the functions on the right - hand side of the equations in ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) be @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "then , the equilibrium solutions of system ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) are obtained by solving the following algebraic equations : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , from which the disease - free equilibrium can be easily obtained as @xmath72 . for the infected equilibrium @xmath73 , @xmath74",
    "is solved from @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",
    "then , substituting @xmath77 into @xmath78 yields a quadratic equation of the form @xmath79 which in turn gives two roots : @xmath80 , where , @xmath81 , @xmath82(d+\\gamma+\\epsilon ) + ( d k+\\beta)\\alpha-\\beta\\lambda$ ] , @xmath83d - \\beta\\lambda\\omega$ ] for system  ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) . since all parameters take positive values , we have @xmath84 . to get the two positive roots essential for backward bifurcation",
    ", it is required that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "noticing that @xmath87 , we can see that the infection force , @xmath9 , the constant influx of the susceptibles , @xmath57 , and the effect of medical treatment @xmath88 are indispensible terms for backward bifurcation .",
    "the number of positive infected equilibrium solutions changes from two to one when the value of @xmath89 passes from negative to positive , which gives a critical point at @xmath90 , that is , @xmath91d",
    "= \\beta\\lambda\\omega$ ] , which is equivalent to @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , we may infer the emergence of backward bifurcation without solving the equilibrium conditions . if we do not consider the medical treatment term @xmath88 and remove it from system ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) , that leads to system  ( [ paper3_eq6 ] ) , which is a typical example of an sir model studied by ( [ paper3_eq2 ] ) . by setting the incidence function as @xmath93",
    ", we have @xmath94 ; @xmath95 and @xmath96 for all @xmath97 ; and @xmath98 for all @xmath97",
    ". therefore , the incidence function @xmath99 , satisfies the conditions given in  ( [ paper3_eq3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the function is concave , and can only have one intersection point with the line @xmath100 in the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane , as shown in figure  [ paper3_fig1](a ) .",
    "thus , the uniqueness of the positive infected equilibrium implies that backward bifurcation can not occur in this case .",
    "moreover , according to the result in  @xcite , the uninfected and infected equilibria are globally asymptotically stable for @xmath101 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "no complex dynamical behavior happens in system  ( [ paper3_eq6 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when we introduce the loss of the infectives due to medical treatment , the dynamics of system ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) differ greatly from system ( [ paper3_eq6 ] ) .",
    "in particular , backward bifurcation emerges and complex dynamical behaviors may occur . to clarify this effect , we denote the function induced by @xmath26 from  ( [ paper3_eq7 ] ) as @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is not an incidence rate .",
    "but , if we fix @xmath104 , there exist @xmath105 , such that @xmath106>0 $ ] , @xmath107 ; and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , for @xmath40 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 actually has a convex - concave ` @xmath6 ' shape , and may have two positive intersection points with the ray line , @xmath114 , in the first quadrant ; see figure  [ paper3_fig1](b ) .",
    "these intersections contribute the two positive equilibrium solutions that are a necessary feature of backward bifurcation .",

    "this cooperative phenomenon in viral infection is expressed by an increasing , saturating infectivity function : @xmath118 . according to the principle of mass action , the incidence function",
    "is then denoted as @xmath119 , which is a convex function with respect to the infectives density @xmath46 .    to analyze the occurrence of possible backward bifurcation ,",

    "moreover , the positive influx constant , having been scaled to @xmath47 , is a necessary term for the positive equilibrium of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the positive influx rate term and the increasing and saturating infectivity function are necessary for backward bifurcation .    in the rest of the subsection",
    ", we further examine the incidence function , @xmath137 without solving the equilibrium solutions .",
