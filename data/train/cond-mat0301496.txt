    "the dynamics of many complex materials is dominated by activated jumps over energy barriers generally higher than @xmath0 . for these systems , the energy - landscape picture , which focuses on the topological relation between locally stable states , has proven very valuable .",
    "disconnectivity graphs , for example , introduced by czerminski and elber  @xcite and applied extensively by others ,  @xcite have provided a first classification of the dynamics of complex systems based on the structure of their respective energy landscape .    in parallel with these developments , oriented towards reconstructing the topology of the energy landscape",
    ", there has been some efforts in trying to characterize the energetics and the nature of the events in clusters ,  @xcite proteins  @xcite and in amorphous materials .",
    "@xcite this extensive sampling is essential in order to try to connect the properties of the landscape with the dynamics measured experimentally , it also serves to build a better understanding of the generic properties of various networks : low vs. high connectivity , bulk vs. finite - size systems , covalent vs. ionic bonding , etc .    in this paper",
    ", we present an extensive study of the structure of the energy landscape of amorphous silicon around two minima .",
    "less extensive studies of this material were already presented both by our group  @xcite and middleton _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite using two different approaches .",
    "using art nouveau , we generate more than 42 000 activated events around a well - relaxed minimum and analyze the properties of the reaction paths connecting this initial minimum to a nearby saddle point and new minimum .",
    "we find that : ( 1 ) the activation mechanisms in _ a_-si are local , limiting somewhat the usefulness of the configurational energy landscape picture , ( 2 ) the activation energy is essentially limited by the energy required to break a single bond , ( 3 ) the entropic barrier is almost identical for all events , ( 4 ) more than 20 % of all events generated are bond - switches of the wooten - winer - weaire type , and ( 5 ) the number of events seems to be of the order 30 to 60 per atom .",
    "we study here the energy landscape around two well - relaxed 1000-atom configurations of _ a_-si .",
    "we focus mostly on the first one , repeating the simulation on a second configuration only to ensure that the results are generic and not dependent on some specific feature of the configuration .",
    "the energy model used is a modified version ( msw ) of the empirical stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential  @xcite developed to ensure that the elastic and structural properties of the amorphous phase of silicon are in agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite with its original parameters , the sw potential describes both the liquid and the crystalline phases with good accuracy but fails to reproduce the experimental structure of the amorphous phase .",
    "@xcite recently , vink and collaborators proposed a slightly different set of parameters ( see table  [ table : params ] ) , which generates the right amorphous structure in addition to providing the correct vibrational properties .",
    "because of its empirical nature and the fact that it is not optimized for dynamics , the energy barriers computed with this potential must be taken with some care .",
    "however , since the structural properties of this material are well described by msw , the qualitative features of the energy landscape are expected to be correct .",
    ".parameters of the original stillinger - weber potential as well as those modified by vink _",
    "_ , as described in ref .",
    "we use the latter set in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the purpose of this study was to characterize in detail the energy landscape around a single minimum in a well - relaxed model of _ a_-si .",
    "previous work has examined much shorter sequences of events as the configuration relaxed and the atoms diffused . here , we performed two extensive simulations , always starting from the same two minima .",
    "our results indicate that events are essentially local with a barrier height limited by the cost of breaking one single bond .",
    "we also found that there is very little variation in the entropic barrier in spite of the wide spread in the energy part .",
    "this is likely related to the fact that the overall shape of the energy landscape is not finely dependent on the specifics of a configuration .",
    "finally , the bias found in art nouveau indicates that it might be possible to contemplate setting up a kinetic monte carlo simulation on this system .",
    "it is interesting to note the strong dissimilarities between the activation barrier distribution as computed from the initial and the final minimum . in particular ,",
    "the barrier measured from the latter are much lower that those measured from the former configuration .",
    "this difference can be explained by the fact that the initial configuration selected is very - well relaxed ; most low energy barrier , associated with a very unstable direction , would have been crossed during the relaxation , in previous events .",
    "these states are likely not contributing to diffusion or the relaxation of the network since they would rapidly relax back into the initial minimum .",
    "the physically relevant barrier distribution for defining the evolution of the system is therefore that measured from the initial minimum .    in spite of the 40,000 + events generated",
    ", the total number of events around a minimum remains unknown .",
    "we can nevertheless estimate that the number of different paths is somewhere between 30 and 60 paths / atom ; as shown here , this number should be independent of the size of the network as all events are local in nature .",
    "finally the stability of the distribution from one minimum to another , as well as the narrow distribution of entropic barriers suggests that it would be possible to develop an accelerated algorithm for _ a_si , similar to that proposed by henkelman and jnsson for the diffusion of cu on cu  @xcite , and that of hernandez - rojas and wales for lj glasses .",
    "@xcite this is made even easier by the exponential bias of art , also seen in lj clusters .",
    "the origin of this bias is not understood but it simplifies significantly the statistical analysis of an art sampling .    at this point , however , the main limitation of this type of simulation is the absence of detailed experimental results .",
    "although the overall energy scale of the barriers is in agreement with experimental numbers , it is difficult to assess whether or not the theoretical description is correct : there is no information available experimentally on the shape of the barrier distribution .",
    "it is currently impossible to generate a better comparison with experiment .",
    "further experimental work is clearly needed to expand on the current available data and help ensure that the advances in numerical results are on solid grounds .",
