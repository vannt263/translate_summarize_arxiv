    "entanglement , a kind of quantum correlation , has been taken to be fundamental resources for quantum information and communication  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have shown that quantum entanglement is absolutely indispensable in such issues like superdense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , etc .",
    "however , it was found that there are some types of nonclassical correlation other than entanglement that also provide some advantages for the quantum systems over their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "such a non - entanglement quantum correlation can be captured by quantum discord  @xcite , which is defined as the difference between quantum mutual information and classical correlation .",
    "investigations have shown that quantum discord is responsible for the computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit ( dqc1 )  @xcite .",
    "one feature of this intrinsically quantum correlation lies on that fact that quantum discord may have nonzero value for certain separable states , while entanglement vanishes  @xcite . in general , for pure states quantum discord and entanglement entropy are equivalent , otherwise they are different .",
    "the difference between quantum discord and entanglement as figures of merit for characterizing quantum correlation is expected to be inherited and manifested in the phenomena of quantum phase transitions ( qpts )  @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "since quantum discord grows towards the critical points in the context of qpts , it work effectively as well as entanglement to signal qpts . on the other hand",
    ", quantum discord may be more advantageous than entanglement at some conditions .",
    "for instance , pairwise quantum discord in infinite @xmath0 chain may be able to signal qpt for distances between sites where pairwise entanglement vanishes  @xcite . for @xmath1 spin chain at finite temperature ,",
    "quantum discord spotlights the critical point with respect to qpt while both entanglement and thermaldynamics quantity fails  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was claimed that quantum discord is the best critical point estimator when one deals with finite - temperature systems  @xcite .    for realistic quantum systems ,",
    "the loss of coherence is inevitable due to the interaction with the environment  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been increasing researches on quantum discord dynamics under the effect of the environment  @xcite . in the markovian environment",
    ", it has been shown that in all cases when entanglement suddenly disappears , quantum discord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , it was argued that quantum algorithms based on quantum discord can be more robust than those based on entanglement . in the non - markovian environment , the decline of quantum discord can be altered .",

    "purity of single central qubit coupled to an isotropic lmg bath witnesses the qpt critical point of the system  @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the behavior of quantum correlation , measured by quantum discord and entanglement , for two central spin qubits coupled to an isotropic lipkin - meshkov - glick bath . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the bath falls into different phases , both measurements of quantum correlation follow distinct paths . </S>",
    "<S> when the bath is in the symmetry - broken phase , as tuning the interaction between two - qubit and the bath being close to the interaction of bath spins , quantum discord and entanglement remain stable values with slight fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the bath with the symmetric phase , quantum discord and entanglement always vary periodically with sharp fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the fluctuations can be enhanced by increasing the coupling strength between qubits and the bath . </S>",
    "<S> the critical point of quantum phase transition of the bath can be revealed clearly by the distinct behaviors of quantum correlation in the different phases of the bath . besides , it is observed that quantum discord is significantly enhanced during the evolution while entanglement periodically vanishes . </S>"
