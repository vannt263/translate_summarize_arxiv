    "it is generally believed that the outflows and jets in a compact binary system containing black holes originate from the disk itself .",
    "there are several hydrodynamical models of the formation of outflows from the disks ranging from the twin - exhaust model of @xcite , to the self - similar models of @xcite and @xcite . assuming that the outflows are transonic in nature , @xcite and @xcite computed the velocity distribution without and with rotational motion in the flow and showed that the flow could become supersonic close to the black hole .",
    "camenzind and his group extensively worked on the magnetized jets and showed that the acceleration and collimation of the jets could be achieved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a subsequent two component transonic flow model , @xcite pointed out that the jets could be formed only from the inner part of the disk , which is also known as the centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer or cenbol .",
    "the cenbol is the compton cloud in a two component flow and is the region between the accretion shock formed by centrifugal barrier at a few tens of schwarzschild radii ( @xmath0 ) and the inner sonic point located at @xmath1 .",
    "if this region remains hot , it would emit hard radiation and the spectrum of the disk would be hard .",
    "the reverse is true if the compton cloud ( cenbol ) is cooled down and the spectrum would be soft .",
    "while the general picture of the outflow formation is thus understood and even corroborated by the radio observation of the base of the powerful jet , such as in m87 @xcite that the base of the jet is only a few tens of @xmath0 , a major question still remained : what fraction of the matter is driven out from the disk and what are the flow parameters on which this fraction depends ? in a numerical simulation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , @xcite , showed that the outflow rates from an inviscid accretion flow strongly depends on the outward centrifugal force and 15 - 20 percent matter can be driven out of the disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the ratio of the outflow rate to inflow rate analytically and found that the shock strength determines the ratio . for very strong and very weak shocks , the outflow rates are very small , while for the shocks of intermediate strength , the outflow rate is significant .",
    "these works were further refined by @xcite who studied the outflow rates self - consistently by modifying the rankine - hugoniot relations in presence of both energy and mass dissipation .",
    "these authors showed that with the increase of dissipation of energy in the flow , the outflow rate is greatly reduced .",
    "this is in line with the recent observations @xcite that the spectrally soft states have less outflows .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the numerical simulations of accretion flows around black holes which are coupled to radiative transfer .",
    "while computing the time variation of the velocity components , density and temperature we also compute the temporal dependence of the spectral properties . as a result , not",
    "only we compute the outflow properties , we correlate them with the spectral properties  a first in this subject .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that whenever the compton cloud or the cenbol is cooled down and the spectrum becomes softer , the flow , originating from cenbol , losses its drive and the outflow rate is greatly reduced .    carrying out hydrodynamic simulations around black holes is not new .",
    "@xcite pioneered the study of accretion flows around black holes .",
    "subsequent work of @xcite with magnetized flow indicated how the angular momentum may be transported and matter may accrete efficiently .",
    "these works used finite difference method .",
    "@xcite studied two - dimensional flows but concentrated only the inner region of the disk , namely , the region less than @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite studied unstable shocks in an inviscid flow , while @xcite studied the oscillations of the centrifugal pressure driven shocks when rankine - hugoniot relations are not satisfied . in a significant development which connects the time dependence of accretion flows with quasi - periodic oscillations",
    ", @xcite suggested that the shocks can oscillate whenever the cooling time scale roughly matches with the infall timescale in the post - shock region .",
    "although only the bremsstrahlung cooling was used , this work provides a natural explanation of the quasi - periodic oscillations or qpos which are observed in black hole candidates .",
    "@xcite carried out the sph simulation in a region with a radial extent of @xmath3 in two dimensions and concentrated on the shock formation .",
    "they demonstrated that a high viscosity can remove the shock from an accretion flow ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite used the finite difference method and allowed the heat generated by viscosity to be radiated away or absorbed totally .",
    "the computational box was up to @xmath4 , but the outer boundary condition was that of a near keplerian flow having no radial velocity .",
    "the inner boundary was kept at @xmath5 .",
    "thus the possibility of having a shock or the inner sonic point was excluded .",
    "the detailed radiative transfer , especially comptonization was not included . to our knowledge ,",
    "ours is a first step to include comptonization coupled to hydrodynamic simulations where both the sources of soft photons ( keplerian disk ) and the hot electrons ( low angular momentum flows ) are included .",

    "the soft photons emerging out of the keplerian disk are intercepted and reprocessed via compton or inverse - compton scattering by the sub - keplerian matter .",
    "an injected photon may undergo no scattering at all or a single or multiple with the hot electrons in between its emergence from the keplerian disk and its escape from the halo .",

    "we show the snapshots of the density and temperature ( in kev ) profiles obtained in a steady state purely from the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "for both the angular momenta cases , we find the presence of two shocks in the accretion flow in the steady state : one paraboloidal shock and the other oblate spheroidal shock near the equatorial plane @xcite . due to the increased centrifugal barrier , the shock forms at a larger radius for the case @xmath19 .      in our simulation , the soft photons",

    "the density is scaled out , rendering the simulation results valid for any accretion rate .",
    "as we are considering only energy flows while keeping the boundary of the numerical grid at a finite distance , we need the sound speed @xmath55 ( i.e. , temperature ) of the flow and the incoming velocity at the boundary points . in order to mimic the horizon of the black hole at the schwarzschild radius , we place an absorbing inner boundary at @xmath56 , inside which all material is completely absorbed into the black hole . for the background matter ( required to avoid division by zero )",

    "the post - shock regions , comptonization is much more effective compared to bremsstrahlung . in the simulation we ignore bremsstrahlung .",
    "of course , this conclusion depends on the mass of the black hole and should be considered for super - massive black holes , for instance .",
    "we divide the keplerian disk in different annuli of width @xmath109 .",

    ", one can not inject these many number of photons in monte carlo simulation because of the limitation of computation time .",
    "so we replace this large number of photons by a lower number of bundles of photons , say , @xmath111 and calculate a weightage factor @xmath112 clearly , from annulus to annulus , the number of photons in a bundle will vary .",

    "this is continued for all the @xmath116 bundles of photons and the revised energy distribution is obtained .      since the hydrogen plasma considered here is ultra - relativistic ( @xmath117 throughout the hydrodynamic simulation ) , thermal energy per particle is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is boltzmann constant , @xmath120 is the temperature of the particle .",
    "the electrons are cooled by the inverse - comptonization of the soft photons emitted from the keplerian disk .",
    "the protons are cooled because of the coulomb coupling with the electrons .",

    "we calculate the total energy loss ( gain ) @xmath115 of electrons inside the box according to what is presented above and subtract that amount to get the new temperature of the electrons inside that box as @xmath129      the hydrodynamic and the radiative transfer codes are coupled together following the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "once a quasi steady state is achieved using the non - radiative hydro - code , we compute the radiation spectrum using the monte carlo code .",
    "this is the first approximation of the spectrum . to include the cooling in the coupled code , we follow these steps : ( i ) we calculate the velocity , density and temperature profiles of the electron cloud from the output of the hydro - code .",
    "( ii ) using the monte carlo code we calculate the spectrum .",
    "( iii ) electrons are cooled ( heated up ) by the inverse - compton ( compton ) scattering .",
    "we calculate the amount of heat loss ( gain ) by the electrons and its new temperature and energy distributions and ( iv ) taking the new temperature and energy profiles as initial condition , we run the hydro - code for a period of time much shorter ( by a factor of  @xmath130 ) than the cooling or infall time scale .",

    "to show the effects of compton cooling on the hydrodynamics of the flow , the cases i(b - d ) and ii(b - d ) are run for the same time as the cases ia and iia .      in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) , we present the time variation of the shock location ( in units of @xmath0 ) for various cases ( marked on each curve ) given in table 1 .",
    "all the solutions exhibit oscillatory shocks . for no cooling , the higher angular momentum produces shocks at a higher radius , which is understandable , since the shock is primarily centrifugal force supported",
    ". however , as the cooling is increased the average shock location decreases since the cooling reduces the post - shock thermal pressure and the shock could not be sustained till higher thermal pressure is achieved at a smaller radius .",
    "the corresponding oscillations are also suppressed .",
    "the average shock location is found to be almost independent of the specific angular momentum at this stage .",
    "this is because the post - shock region is hotter in cases i(a - d ) , and thus it cools at a very smaller time scale . in figure 6 , we show the colour map of the temperature distribution at the end of our simulation .",

    "the specific angular momentum is @xmath139 in the left panel and @xmath140 in the right panel .",
    "cases are marked .",
    "we note the collapse of the post - shock region as @xmath35 is increased gradually .",
    "we take the post - shock region in each of these cases , and plot in figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) the average temperatures of the post - shock region only for those cases where the cooling due to comptonization is included .",
    "the average temperature was obtained by the optical depth weighted averaging procedure prescribed in @xcite .",
    "the average temperature in the post - shock region is reduced rapidly as the supply of the soft photons is increased .",
    "we now concentrate on how the outflow rate is affected by the comptonization .",
    "outflows move to very large distances and thus must not be bound to the system , i.e. , the specific energy should be positive .",
    "matter should also be of higher entropy as it is likely to be relativistic . because of this we wish to concentrate on the behaviour of matter which have highest energy and entropy . though we injected matter at the outer edge with a constant specific energy , the energy of matter in the post - shock region",
    "is redistributed due to turbulence , compton cooling and shock heating .",
    "some entropy is generated as well .",
    "the high energy and high entropy matter escape in the form of a hollow cone around the axis .",
    "it is thus expected that if the post - shock region itself is collapsed due to comptonization , the outflows will also be quenched .",
    "we show this effect in our result . in figure 8 , we present the specific energy distribution for both the specific angular momenta ( left panel for @xmath19 and right panel for @xmath6 ) for all the cooling cases ( marked in each box ) at the end of our simulation . the velocity vectors are also plotted .",
    "the scale on the right gives the specific energy .",
    "first we note that the jets are stronger for higher angular momentum .",
    "this is because the post - shock region ( between the shock and the inner sonic point close to the horizon ) is hotter .",
    "second , lesser and lesser amount of matter has higher energy as the cooling is increased . a similar observation could be made from figure 9 , where the entropy distribution is plotted .",
    "the jet matter having upward pointing vectors have higher entropy .",
    "however , this region shrinks with the increase in keplerian rate , as the cooling becomes significant the outward thermal drive is lost .",
    "here , the velocity vectors are of length @xmath141 at the outer boundary on the right and others are scaled accordingly .    in order to quantify the decrease in the outflow rates with cooling , we define two types of outflow rates .",
    "one is @xmath142 which is defined to be the rate at which outward pointing flow leaves the computational grid .",
    "this will include both the high and low energy components of the flow . in figures 10(a ) and ( b ) , we show the results of time variation of the ratio @xmath143 ( @xmath144 / @xmath145 ) for the four cases ( marked in each box ) , @xmath145 being the constant injection rate on the right boundary . while the ratio is clearly a time varying quantity , we observe that with the increase in cooling the ratio is dramatically reduced and indeed become almost saturated as soon as some cooling is introduced .",
    "our rigorous finding once again verified what was long claimed to be the case , namely , the spectrally soft states ( those having a relatively high keplerian rate ) have weaker jets because of the presence of weaker shocks @xcite .",
    "another measure of the outflow rate would be to concentrate only those matter which have high positive energy and high entropy .",
    "for concreteness , we concentrate only on matter outflowing within @xmath146 at the upper boundary of our computational grid .",
    "we define this to be @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "figures 11(a ) and 11(b ) show time variation of @xmath147 .",
    "the different cases are marked on the curves .",
    "this outflow rate fluctuates with time .",
    "we easily find that the cooling process reduces this high energy component of matter drastically .",
    "thus both the slow moving outflows and fast moving jets are affected by the comptonization process at the base .      in each simulation",
    "we also store the photons emerging out of the computational grid after exchanging energy and momentum with the free electrons in the disk matter .",
    "when the keplerian disk rate is increased , the injected soft photons go up , cooling every electron in the sub - keplerian halo component .",
    "thus , the relative availability of the soft photons and the hot electrons in the disk and the jet dictates whether the emergent photons would be spectrally soft or hard . in figures 12(a ) and 12(b ) , we show three spectra for each of the specific angular momenta : ( a ) @xmath19 and ( b ) @xmath6 .",
    "the cases are marked .",
    "we see that a spectrum is essentially made up of the soft bump ( injected multi - colour black body spectrum from the keplerian disk ) , and a comptonized spectrum with an exponential cutoff  the cutoff energy being dictated by the electron cloud temperature .",
    "if we define the energy spectral index @xmath149 to be @xmath150 in the region @xmath151 kev , we note that @xmath149 increases , i.e. , the spectrum softens with the increase in @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with the static model of @xcite .    in reality , since the disk is not stationary , the spectrum also varies with time , and so is @xmath149 . in figure 13",
    ", we present the time variation of the spectral index for the different cases . we draw the running mean through these variations .",
    "we clearly see that the spectral index goes up with the increase in the disk accretion rate .",
    "thus , on an average , the spectrum softens .",
    "we also find that the spectrum oscillates quasi - periodically and the frequency is higher for higher cooling rate .",
    "this agrees with the general observations that the qpo frequency rises with luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to understand the physical reason behind the shock oscillations .",
    "it has been argued by numerical simulation @xcite this oscillation is due to a resonance effect .",
    "when the cooling time scale _ roughly _ agrees with the infall time scale , the post - shock region , i.e. , the cenbol may oscillate .",
    "as the cenbol oscillates , the high energy part of the spectrum also oscillates since the cenbol is mainly responsible to energize the soft photons coming out from the keplerian disk to high energy .",
    "indeed , when we compute the cooling time scale and the infall time scale , we find that in all the cases when oscillations occur , the ratio of cooling time scale and infall time scale on an average remains within forty percent of each other .",
    "of course , in the absence of cooling effects , some times the shock oscillations is possible when the rankine - hugoniot condition is not fulfilled @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation in this case is generally quite large and the result strongly depends on the specific angular momentum and specific energy of the flow .",
    "observationally , different types of qpos have been observed .",
    "this aspect requires a further study which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we compute the effects of compton cooling on the formation and rates of the outflows and jets .",
    "most importantly , we study the variation of the spectral slope .",
    "we employ a hydrodynamic code based on the total variation diminishing method coupled to a monte carlo simulation to take care of the time dependent radiative transfer problem .",
    "we found many important results which can be briefly summarized as follows : ( a ) the increase in the keplerian disk rate cools down the post - shock region of a sub - keplerian flow and as a result the shock advances closer to the black hole .",
    "( b ) the cooler and smaller sized post - shock region produced a weaker outflow / jet .",
    "( c ) the spectrum becomes softer when the cooling is increased .",
    "( d ) quasi - periodic oscillations are produced as a result of near resonance between the cooing time scale as the infall time scale .",
    "we coupled the hydrodynamics and comptonization using a two step process .",
    "this is natural : comptonization is strongly non - local process and the results are obtained by monte carlo method . however , the hydrodynamics code is a finite difference code .",
    "so at every instant both effects can not be taken into account .",
    "the effects of radiative cooling or heating due to comptonization is included in the hydrodynamics after each monte carlo step .",
    "after that the hydrodynamic code is advanced for a time period which is a factor of @xmath152 lower than the cooling or hydrodynamic time scale , whichever is lesser before running the monte - carlo step once more .",
    "thus our dynamics is affected by the radiative cooling or heating effects .    in this context , it is important to note that the effects of radiation is not the same as in a single component flow . in a single component disk , such as the standard accretion disk ,",
    "the radiation field is strong ( especially when the accretion rate crosses the eddington rate ) as has been shown for example , by @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , the radiation field is important only if it interacted with electrons . in a two component flow ,",
    "there are two effects which affect the dynamics of the electrons ( a ) the thermal acceleration @xmath153 depends on the gradient of thermal pressure and ( b ) the radiative acceleration @xmath154 depends on the number of compton scattering and the amount of energy and momentum exchanged in the process ( i.e. , depends on local temperature ) .",
    "both @xmath153 and @xmath154 have strong dependence on both the accretion rates . for a fixed halo rate , @xmath154",
    "monotonically rises with disk rate but not exactly as in @xcite , since the results depend on the optical depth of the halo .",
    "@xmath153 need not rise monotonically , however .",
    "we find that with the rise of the disk rate , initial rising trend of @xmath153 is reversed because the electrons are cooled down at a higher keplerian disk rate , so the local temperature becomes low .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath155 remains much less than unity even for @xmath156 .",
    "some of these results , as such , have been anticipated both theoretically and observationally . from the theoretical point of view @xcite , in the two component model showed that the spectrum becomes softer .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that the outflow rate becomes smaller when shock becomes weaker .",
    "the shock oscillation model observations reported by @xcite point to the same correlation between the spectral states and the outflow rates . however , it is the first time that we demonstrate the results with a complete coupled numerical simulations .",
    "the results we found are quite general and should be valid even for massive black holes , provided the cooling plays a role in the dynamics of the flow .",
