    "<S> based on the quark mass density- and temperature- dependent model we suggest a model for nuclear matter where the meson field is introduced to be directly coupled to the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic formation of the nucleon bag , the saturation properties of nuclear matter as well as equation of state for this model are studies .    relativistic calculation of infinite nuclear matter as well as neutron matter plays an important role in nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum hadrodynamics(qhd ) models@xcite based on baryon and meson degress of freedom form a reasonable starting point for the study of bulk as well as single - particle properties of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) is believed to be essential in the study of nuclear phenomena from the quark structure of nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> it is also popular to describe nucleon , hyperon or strangelet in terms of bag models .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark mass density- and temperature- dependent model(qmdtd ) is an extension of the original quark mass density- dependent model(qmdd)@xcite . while the latter can almost reproduce the properties of quark matter obtained by the mit bag model@xcite , but it meets many difficulties when we extend this model to finite temperature@xcite . based on frieberg - lee soliton bag models@xcite , it is recognized that the bag constant @xmath0 decreases with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes zero and the nontopological solition solution dissappears at the phase transition point @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic deconfinement mechanism is incorporated in the qmdtd model by introducing an ansatz @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the vacuum energy density inside the bag at zero temperature , @xmath4 is the critical temperature of quark deconfinement phase transition , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are two adjust parameters . in our previous papers@xcite , we have investigated the properties of strange matter and strangelets by using the qmdtd model .    since the quarks in qmdtd model do not interact with each other , one can not directly employ this model to investigate the bulk properties of hadronic system . </S>",
    "<S> many years ago , the quark - meson coupling(qmc)@xcite model was proposed to describe nucleon and nuclear matter . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> baryon matter is consisting of non - overlapping mit bags bound by the self - consistent exchange of mesons in the mean field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the quarks are confined in the nucleon bag by the boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> inspiring by the qmc model , one can also incorporate the quark - meson coupling mechanism in the qmdtd model , and employ this model to investigate the nuclear matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the present work evolves from an attempt to extend the qmdtd model to describe infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature by introducing the explicit quark meson coupling in the same way as that of the qmc model . </S>",
    "<S> the major difference between the present treatment and the qmc model is that our model is based on fridberg - lee non - topological soliton model and qmc model is based on the mit bag model .    in the qmdtd model , </S>",
    "<S> the masses of @xmath7 , @xmath8 quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the baryon number density , @xmath11 is the vacuum energy density .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark meson coupling is introduced in the similar way resembling that of qmc model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the mean field values for the scalar field @xmath14 and time component of vector field @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the effecitve quark mass @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 the energy of the nucleon bag is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the single particle energy , @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the quark - meson coupling constants , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the density of states@xcite for various flavor quarks and @xmath25 is the fermi momentum for quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the stability condition for the bag radius @xmath26 thus reads @xmath27    the total energy per nucleon at the nuclear density @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mass for @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons respectively , the effective mass of nucleon is defined as the bag energy @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the baryon densities for proton and neutron , @xmath28 is the total baryon density and @xmath34 is the fermi momentum for the nucleons . the @xmath15 mean field </S>",
    "<S> is determined by @xmath35 where we have defined that the couplings between nucleon and mesons are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the scalar mean field @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> is determined by self - consistency condition@xcite : @xmath38    now we are in a position to present numerical results . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the result is irrelevant to the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6.@xcite we take @xmath39 to fix the mass of nucleon to be @xmath40 . in fig.1 , the saturation curve for symmetric nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> is depicted , where we have choosen the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 to reproduce the binding energy @xmath43 at @xmath44 for symmetric nuclear matter at saturation point when @xmath45 , and find @xmath46 the corresponding equation of state(eos ) for symmetric nuclear matter is given in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constants between quark and mesons and some calculated quantities such as the effective nuclear mass(@xmath47 ) , compressibility(@xmath48 ) , bag radius(@xmath26 ) and its relative modification ( with respect to its value at zero density ) of nuclear matter at saturation density are listed in table 1 . to make a comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also enumerate the results obtained by the qmc model in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these quantities of nuclear matter in our present model differ not very much from those of the qmc model .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a possible nuclear matter saturation mechanism based on the qmdtd model . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the qmc model to introduce the quark meson couping under mean field approximation which provide a reasonable description for nuclear matter . </S>"
