    "even after the discovery of the higgs particle at the lhc , the origin of the electroweak scale is still an unsolved problem . here we consider a scale - invariant extension of the standard model with a singlet scalar and hidden non - abelian gauge theory@xcite .",
    "the model contains the sm fields , a singlet scalar @xmath0 and a scale - invariant hidden qcd sector .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass parameter of the sm higgs .",
    "@xmath3 is the field strength of the hidden - qcd with @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "the sm singlet scalar @xmath0 couples to the hidden - qcd quarks @xmath5 through the yukawa interaction @xmath6 .",
    "since there are no dimension - full parameters in the lagrangian , this system is scale - invariant at a classical level .",
    "thanks to the asymptotic - free behavior of the hidden - qcd , at a quantum level and at a low - energy scale , the hidden - qcd quarks can condensate @xmath7 , which induce a linear term of @xmath0 .",
    "then the potential of @xmath0 can be tilted and @xmath0 can develop a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the vev of the singlet scalar generates a higgs mass term @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 so that non - zero @xmath10 triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "hereafter we consider the case in which @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "then the low - energy effective theory of the hidden - qcd is described by the pi - meson triplets and the sigma meson .",
    "it can be written in the form of a linear - sigma model @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represents sigma and pi meson fields , respectively .",
    "we parameterize the vacuum expectation values and fluctuations of scalars as @xmath18 three vacuum conditions reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "furthermore , two parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 are traded with the pion mass @xmath21 and a sigma meson mass parameter @xmath22 .",
    "hence the scalar mass matrix @xmath23 takes the form of @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since one of the physical scalar should be the higgs boson with mass @xmath29 is one of the eigenvalues of @xmath30 , one can use a condition @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is a @xmath33 unit matrix ) to express @xmath34 in an analytical form .",
    "we parameterize @xmath35 .    at this stage",
    "we have four free parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or @xmath38 ) . to reduce the number of free parameters , in particlar , to relate the @xmath22 with @xmath39",
    ", we use a holographic treatment of the qcd .",
    "we follow mainly @xcite , but unlike the original work by rold and pomarol@xcite in which the lightest scalar meson resonance is identified with @xmath40 , we regard the lightest scalar meson state as the sigma meson . and we imposed a new condition for sigma - singlet mixing @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the decay constant and mass of the sigma meson , respectively . using and gell - mann  oaks - renner relation the above relation is written by @xmath44     for @xmath45 in the ads / qcd@xcite in the unit of @xmath46 . ]    for @xmath47 we obtain for @xmath48 .",
    "we also find that with this value we obtain @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this value well agree with the observed @xmath51 meson mass @xmath52 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) .    .",
    "we also plot @xmath53 as the horizontal solid line . ]",
    "in this preliminary study , we fix @xmath54 and consider a parameter region @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "three scalar particles @xmath57 is mixed with each other by the mass matrix .",
    "mass - eigenstates are @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 corresponds to the physical higgs boson and @xmath61 . @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 can be heavier or lighter than the physical higgs @xmath60 .",
    "the signal strength of the higgs production and decay will be suppressed by a mixing matrix element @xmath64 : @xmath65 for the signal strength of our scale invariant model @xmath66 , we imposed a constraint @xmath67    in fig .",
