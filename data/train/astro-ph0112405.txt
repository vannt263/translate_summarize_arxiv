    "two of the outstanding issues for sne are the nucleosynthesis and the explosion mechanism .",
    "although sne have been known from the 1950 s to be the most important sources of heavy elements , there is little quantitative evidence for this .",
    "sn 1987a has in this respect been a unique source of information thanks to the possibility to obtain spectral information at very late epochs when the ejecta is transparent and the central regions observable .",
    "the nature of the explosion mechanism is still to a large extent unknown , and constraints from observations are badly needed .",
    "the main such constraints are provided by the hydrodynamic structure , e.g. , the extent of mixing , and the masses of the iron peak elements , in particular the radioactive isotopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "to estimate the masses of the three most abundant radioactive isotopes formed in the explosion , ,   and  , one can use several approaches , each with its special advantages and disadvantages ( fransson & kozma , in preparation ) . the best known , and for the  mass most reliable , is the bolometric light curve . as shown by e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "this yields a   mass of @xmath2 .    for , or rather , , which dominates the light curve between 1100  1800 days ,",
    "this is not so straightforward , and a simple approach similar to that of , yielded a   mass at least twice as large as other methods , and much higher than could be produced by the nucleosynthesis models @xcite .",
    "this was shown by @xcite to be a result of time dependent effects in the light curve .",
    "because of the decreasing density and ionization , the recombination time scale ( @xmath3 ) as well as the cooling time scale , become longer than the expansion time scale , @xmath4 .",
    "the gas is therefore not able to recombine and cool at the same rate as the radioactive input takes place , and only a fraction of the radioactive input is released as radiation .",
    "the difference is released later as recombination radiation , giving a higher luminosity than the instantaneous input .",
    "the bolometric light curve therefore gives an overestimate of the radioactive mass if a simple steady state calculation is employed .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show a time dependent calculation of the bolometric light curve , and also showing the various individual radioactivity contributions .",
    "when we compare the bolometric luminosity with the total energy input one sees that between @xmath5 days and @xmath6 days the bolometric luminosity is up to a factor three higher than the input . at very late time",
    "most of the energy input is in the iron rich zones by positrons from , making time dependent effects less important .",
    "the most serious problem of using the bolometric light curve at late times is the large bolometric correction necessary because nearly all of the emission emerges in the unobserved far - ir . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we nevertheless show the time - dependent bolometric light curve .",
    "this represents an extension of the modeling in fransson & kozma ( 1993 ) to later epochs , and with updated physics . the freeze - out increases in this case the luminosity by a factor 2  3 at epochs later than 1200 days .",
    "the observations come from ctio data by @xcite , and eso data by @xcite .",
    "while the agreement with the ctio data is good , the agreement is considerably worse with the eso data during the late epochs .",
    "the discrepancy between the eso and ctio data probably gives a good estimate of the systematic errors in the observations , and it is clear that a different approach has to be taken for estimating the mass of , and also to get a more accurate estimate of the   mass .",
    "co@xmath7 , m@xmath8co@xmath9 , and m@xmath10ti@xmath11 .",
    "data are from @xcite ( dots ) and from suntzeff ( 1992 ) ( triangles ) .",
    "the dotted line gives the steady state light curve , while the solid shows the same with time dependent effects included.,width=302 ]    the second approach involves modeling of the line emission from the ejecta .",
    "an example of this was shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where we show   light curves for three different values of the   mass . .",
    "although the model reproduces the observations very well during the whole evolution , as a measure of the @xmath12ti mass the light curve is clearly not very sensitive . nearly all of the excitation is due to gamma - rays absorbed by the envelope , and the line is therefore strongly affected by the freeze - out .",
    "most of the emission at @xmath13 days is in fact due to the delayed recombination from the epoch at @xmath14 days when @xmath15co dominated the energy input .",
    "a better alternative is to use lines from the metal rich core , in particular the fe i and fe ii lines . an important result found by chugai ( 1997 )",
    "is that in order to reproduce the fe ii flux , positrons have to be trapped efficiently in the iron rich gas .",
    "pure coulomb collisions are not sufficient for this , but a weak magnetic field is enough to make the gyro radius of the positrons small enough .",
    "a severe problem is , however , that modeling of individual lines is very sensitive to atomic data , which in spite of dramatic improvements from the iron - project , is still a problem . in a similar attempt",
    "@xcite have tried to use the fir [ fe ii ] @xmath16 fine structure line in connection with observations by iso .",
    "unfortunately , only an upper limit to the flux was obtained , yielding an upper limit to the   mass of @xmath17 .",
    "there is , however , a number of loop holes in this result , such as extra dust cooling , mixing with other heavy elements contributing to the cooling like silicon and sulphur , as well as uncertainties in the atomic data .    a compromise between these two approaches is offered by broad band photometry , where photometry in the optical and near - ir is compared to synthetic photometry from spectral calculations .",
    "this method avoids the need to extrapolate into the far - ir for the bolometric light curve , as well as many of the uncertainties involved in the calculation of individual lines . rather than modeling individual lines , the broad band fluxes are mainly sensitive to the division between uv , optical and ir in the spectral distributions of the elements",
    "this is determined by the atomic configuration , i.e. the term diagram , and less by the exact path a recombining photon takes when cascading to the ground state . except for the fraction of the emission in the optical and ir which is absorbed by the dust , the photometry is insensitive to this component .",
    "the fraction absorbed by dust can be estimated from mid - ir observations , as well as from line profile shifts ( lucy 1991 ) .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the b and v band light curves together with observations .",
    "the reason for concentrating on these bands is that they are strongly dominated by lines from fe i and fe ii , and therefore most sensitive to the   mass , in contrast to the r band which is dominated by , and therefore sensitive to the freeze out .",
    "observations are taken from suntzeff ( 1991 ) and hst observations from suntzeff ( 2001 ) .",
    "the models have @xmath18 of @xmath19co , @xmath20 of @xmath15co and three different values of the   mass , @xmath21 .",
    "as can be seen , both the b and v bands are well reproduced by the observations throughout the whole evolution , and the currently best estimate of the  mass is in the range @xmath22 .",
    "this method also yields the best estimate of the   mass , @xmath23 .",
