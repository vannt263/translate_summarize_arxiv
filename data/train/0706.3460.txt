    "recently , significant progress has been made in surveying the extragalactic sky at photon energies above 10 kev .",
    "observations at these energies are efficient for finding absorbed agns , as they probe heavily obscured regions / objects , i.e. those that could be missed in optical , uv and even soft x - ray surveys .",
    "quantifying the fraction of nearby absorbed agns , particularly those that have @xmath7 @xmath2 ( i.e. the ones in compton thick regime ) , is necessary if one wants to understand the accretion history of the universe and study a population of objects poorly explored so far .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of column densities is a key parameter for estimating the contribution of agns to the x - ray cosmic diffuse background and for testing current unified theories .",
    "a number of surveys performed above @xmath010 kev are now available and can be used to study absorption in agns .",
    "the recent _ rxte _ survey made in the 820 kev energy band using slew observations ( revnivtsev et al . 2004",
    "; sazonov & revnivtsev 2004 ) resulted in a list of 68 objects ( above 3@xmath8 level ) down to a flux limit of about @xmath9 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ; 14 of these detections are still unidentified and so lack optical classification , which is the first step in any survey work ( but see bikmaev et al .",
    "furthermore , no information on the x - ray spectral shape of the less known objects is available .",
    "an even greater step forward has been provided by the _ swift _ bat survey , which is sensitive in the 15195 kev band above a flux of @xmath0@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( markwardt et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although primarily devoted to the study of gamma - ray bursts , _ swift _ observes the sky in survey mode when it is not responding to these events ; with a large field of view of @xmath10 2 sr , galactic and extragalactic x-/@xmath11-ray sources can thus be serendipitously detected .",
    "preliminary results from the first three months of observations provided a first sample of 66 objects : 12 were galactic sources and 45 extragalactic objects ( 44 agns and the coma cluster ) ; the 9 remaining sources were not optically classified .",
    "after this initial work , a number of new detections have also been reported ( tueller et al . 2005 ; kennea et al . 2005 ; ajello et al .",
    "2006a ) and often the proposed counterpart is not optically classified or characterized in x - rays below 10 kev .",
    "in parallel with our ongoing program of optical classification of _ integral _ ibis sources ( masetti et al .",
    "2004 , 2006a , b , c , d ) , we have included in our activities follow - up work on unclassified objects detected with _",
    "swift _ and _ rxte_. here , we report on optical / x - ray follow - up observations of a sample of 11 _ swift _ bat detections ( tueller et al . 2005 ; kennea et al . 2005 ; ajello et al .",
    "2006a , b ; grupe et al .",
    "2006 ) plus of an agn detected in the _ rxte _ slew survey ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "our optical spectroscopy allows for the first time the classification of 8 objects and a distance estimate for 3 of them ; for another object a more refined optical classification than that available in the literature is also provided .",
    "despite having already been classified in the literature , 3 more objects were re - observed in order to have information on their optical status closer in time to the x - ray measurements .",
    "although for most , but not all , objects in the sample , x - ray spectroscopy was published in the form of atels , we have repeated the analysis here in order to include more observations and to provide a more uniform data set . in some cases we find significant differences between the published results and our own analyses . in the case of swift j0918.5",
    "+ 1618 we also retrieved and analyzed an archival _ asca _ observation in order to have more detailed information on the source x - ray spectrum and to solve the issues related to the possible compton thick nature of this type 1 seyfert ( ajello et al .",
    "2006a ) .",
    "the optical results presented in this paper and concerning the _ swift _ sources supersede the preliminary and concise ones presented in the atels by masetti et al . ( 2006e ) and morelli et al . (",
    "in this section we present x - ray observations acquired with the xrt ( x - ray telescope , 0.210 kev ) on board the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "xrt data reduction was performed using the xrtdas v. 1.8.0 standard data pipeline package ( xrtpipeline v. 0.10.3 ) , in order to produce screened event files .",
    "all data were extracted only in the photon counting ( pc ) mode ( hill et al .",
    "2004 ) , adopting the standard grade filtering ( 012 for pc ) according to the xrt nomenclature .",
    "the log of all x - ray observations is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for each measurement , we report the position of the xrt source associated with the high energy emitting object seen with _",
    "swift _ bat or with _ rxte _ pca , its uncertainty at a 90% confidence level , the xrt observation date , the relative exposure time , the energy band adopted in the source spectral fitting ( which may vary depending on the statistical quality of each exposure ) , and the corresponding source count rate .",
    "images have been extracted in the 0.310 kev energy band and searched for significant excesses associated with the _ swift _ bat or _ rxte _",
    "pca sources . in all cases ,",
    "a single bright x - ray source was detected inside the bat positional uncertainty ; for the _ rxte _ source , the bright object detected with xrt coincides with the proposed _",
    "rosat _ counterpart ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "the only exception , swift j0601.98636 , was @xmath12 away from the bat detection ( kennea et al .",
    "2006 ) , i.e. just marginally consistent with the bat position .",
    "this source has recently been detected also by _ integral _ ibis and localized with a @xmath13 uncertainty by this instrument ( bird et al .",
    "2007 ) ; the intersection of _ swift _ bat and _ integral _ ibis error boxes clearly indicates that only leda 18394 ( also eso 005g004 , box in figure  [ errorbox ] ) is the counterpart of this high energy emitting object .",
    "the other possible counterpart ( smaller circle in figure  [ errorbox ] ) can be excluded as optical spectroscopy acquired with the same setup at the 1.5 m ctio telescope on february 19 , 2007 , shows that it is a star , likely of spectral type a , without any peculiar spectral characteristics , i.e. it is unlikely to emit x - rays above 10 kev .",
    "events for spectral and temporal analysis were extracted within a circular region of radius 20@xmath14 , centered on the source position , which encloses about 90% of the psf at 1.5 kev ( see moretti et al .",
    "the background was taken from various source - free regions close to the x - ray source of interest , using both circular / annular regions with different radii in order to ensure an evenly sampled background . in all cases ,",
    "the spectra were extracted from the corresponding event files using the xselect software and binned using grppha in an appropriate way , so that the @xmath15 statistic could be applied .",
    "we used the latest version ( v.008 ) of the response matrices and create individual ancillary response files ( arf ) using xrtmkarf .",
    "spectral analyses have been performed using xspec version 12.2.1 , while for temporal analyses we adopted the xronos package ( version 5.21 ) .",
    "each individual observation was inspected in order to assess the presence of short - term variability . in only three cases",
    "did we find significant short - term changes ( swift j0444.1 + 2813 , swift j0732.51331 and swift j1200.8 + 0650 with a rms variability of 2040% , 1030% and @xmath020% , respectively ) , but the low statistical quality of the data prevented any spectral analysis within segments of these observations .    for sources with more than one pointing , we first analysed individual spectra to search for variability , and then combined the data to improve the statistics .    in just a few cases ( swift j0918.5 + 1618 , swift j1009.34250 and swift j1038.84942 )",
    ", we found significant changes in flux , but not in spectral shape , between different observing periods . to allow for these flux variations , fits to the combined data were performed with the power law normalization free to vary .    due to the limited spectral signal often available , we first employed a simple model of a power law absorbed by both a galactic ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and an intrinsic column density ( our baseline ) .",
    "if this baseline model was not sufficient to fit the data , we then introduced extra spectral components as required .",
    "the results of the analysis of both single and combined observations are reported in table  [ tab2 ] and table  [ tab3 ] respectively , where we list : the galactic absorption according to dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) ; the column density in excess to the galactic value ; the photon index ; the 210 kev flux ; the reduced @xmath15 of the best - fit model and the column density measured by fixing the spectral photon index to a canonical value for an agn ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we also list in table  [ tab3 ] the parameters relevant to any extra spectral features ( e.g. soft excess component and iron line ) required by the data in a few sources .",
    "in particular , we have added : an unabsorbed power law component having the same photon index of the primary continuum in 3 type 2 agns ( swift j0444.1 + 2813 , swift j1009.34250 and swift j1930.5 + 3414 ) ; a thermal component in the only galactic source in the sample ( swift j0732.51331 ) ; and an iron line in two agn ( swift j1238.92720 and xss j123034232 ) .",
    "the extra power law could be interpreted as scattered emission , which is a spectral component often found in type 2 seyferts ( risaliti 2002 ) .",
    "all quoted errors correspond to a 90@xmath4 confidence level for a single parameter of interest ( @xmath17 ) .    in one case ( swift j0918.5 + 1618 )",
    ", we also used archival _",
    "asca _ gis ( gas imaging spectrometers , ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ) data to better characterize the source spectrum . the relevant spectra and associated files",
    "were downloaded from the tartarus database and analyzed with the same xspec version used for the xrt data .",
    "for this particular case , the best - fit results are presented in table  [ tab4 ] .",

    "data were acquired using grating # 13/i and with a slit width of 1@xmath225 , giving a nominal spectral coverage between 3300 and 10500   and a dispersion of 5.7   / pix . in one case ( swift j1009.34250 = eso 26313 ) we retrieved an archival optical spectrum , with dispersion 1.6   / pix , acquired with the 4-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) within the 6df galaxy survey ( jones et al .",
    "2004 ) ; we refer the reader to this latter paper for observational details .",
    "the complete log of the observations is reported in table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "after cosmic - ray rejection , the loiano and ctio spectra were reduced , background subtracted and optimally extracted ( horne 1986 ) using iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using he - ar lamps acquired soon after each spectroscopic exposure ; the loiano spectra were then flux - calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard bd+25@xmath233941 ( stone 1977 ) , whereas the ctio spectra used the standard star ltt 7379 ( hamuy et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) . finally , and when applicable , different spectra of the same object were stacked together to increase the s / n ratio .",
    "the wavelength calibration uncertainty was @xmath00.5    for all cases ; this was checked using the positions of background night sky lines .",
    "instrumental broadening of spectral features is ( in terms of @xmath8 assuming a gaussian description ) @xmath24260 km s@xmath3 and @xmath24300 km s@xmath3 for the loiano and ctio spectra , respectively .    to flux calibrate the optical spectrum of swift j1009.34250 ( originally expressed in counts ) we considered the @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes of winkler & payne ( 1990 ) , which were acquired on a 30@xmath27 circular region centered on the source , and rescaled them to the 6df optical fibre aperture ( 6@xmath227 in diameter )",
    "this was done using the supercosmos ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) digitized images and the conversions from the supercosmos to the johnson - cousins photometry system ( colless 2003 ) .",
    "we then used these rescaled magnitudes to convert the spectrum counts into physical units . for the agn classification",
    ", we used the criteria of veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) and the line ratio diagnostics of ho et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1997 ) ; moreover , for the subclass assignation of seyfert 1 nuclei , we used the h@xmath28/[o iii]@xmath295007 line flux ratio criterion as in winkler ( 1992 ) .",
    "the quoted optical magnitudes are extracted from the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "table  [ tab6 ] reports the emission line fluxes of the most interesting lines in each spectrum .",
    "the line fluxes and absolute magnitudes from extragalactic sources presented in this paper were dereddened for galactic absorption along their line of sight following the prescription for the computation of the galactic color excess @xmath30 ( also reported in table  [ tab6 ] ) as in schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and assuming the galactic extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "for the intrinsic reddening calculations , we assumed an intrinsic h@xmath31/h@xmath28 line ratio of 2.86 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the spectra of the galaxies shown here were not corrected for starlight contamination ( see , e.g. , ho et al . 1993 , 1997 ) given their limited s / n and resolution .",
    "we do not consider this to affect any of our conclusions .",
    "we have also compared , in table  [ tab6 ] , the extinction obtained from the optical ( @xmath32 ) and x - ray data ( @xmath33 ) . when this is possible , we find that @xmath32 is generally smaller than @xmath33 ; for agn this is not a new result as it was first noticed by maccacaro et al .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not clear , but could be due to the optical and x - ray absorption coming from different media / regions ( weingartner @xmath34 murray 2002 ) or due to a dust to gas ratio or dust grain dimensions different than in our galaxy ( maiolino et al .",
    "2001 ) . only in one case ( swift j0601.98636 )",
    "do we find that @xmath33 is smaller than @xmath32 , but this may be due a false estimate of the absorption column density in the x - ray spectrum ( see section 5.2 ) and the likely compton thick nature of this source ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "figures 13 and 14 show the optical spectra of all agn in the sample , while the optical spectrum of the galactic source swift j0732.51331 is presented in the appendix .",
    "to further characterize our objects , we have used diagnostic diagrams to confirm the presence of an active nucleus and to discriminate between compton thin and thick sources .",
    "it is in fact possible in some cases that the agn component is so deeply absorbed that other components , such as a starburst , dominate in the optical spectrum ( masetti et al . 2006c ) .",
    "since the ir emission is generally associated with star - forming activity while the [ o iii ] emission is mainly produced by photons generated in the active nucleus , we can employ the @xmath35}$]/@xmath36 ratio to discriminate between agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed , in the ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample of nearby galaxies , 90@xmath4 of those classified as starbursts have a value of @xmath35}$]/@xmath36 below 10@xmath37 , while 88@xmath4 of the agn have ratios above this value ( panessa and bassani 2002 ) .",
    "generally , indirect arguments are used to probe the compton thick versus thin nature of a type 2 agn , and these include the equivalent width of the iron line , and the ratio of anisotropic ( i.e. modified by absorption such as the 210 kev emission ) versus isotropic ( i.e. not modified by absorption ) luminosities .",
    "the [ o iii]@xmath295007 ( [ o iii ] hereafter ) flux is considered as a good isotropic indicator because it is produced in the narrow line regions , which are not strongly affected by absorption ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ; risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ; bassani et al .",
    "the @xmath38/@xmath35}$ ] ratio has been studied in a large sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ; all compton thin seyfert ( type 1 and 2 ) show ratios higher than 1 , while compton thick sources show @xmath39/@xmath35}$ ] ratios below this value ( bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "another isotropic indicator is the far - infrared ( fir ) emission which is probably produced in even more external regions ; typically , type 1 and compton thin type 2 agns show @xmath38/@xmath36 ratios around or above 0.1 , while compton thick type 2 objects show ratios lower than @xmath40 ( david et al . 1992 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "1994 ; risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , the validity of this diagnostic is less certain because many components besides the nuclear one ( for example coming from star - burst activity and from the host galaxy ) may contribute to the ir flux .",
    "these caveats should be kept in mind when dealing with this particular ratio .",
    "finally , emission above 20 kev can be used as an isotropic probe too as it is virtually unaffected by absorption as long as logn@xmath41 is below 24.5 ; for higher column density even the emission above 20 kev is blocked and can only be seen indirectly . using a sample of hard x - ray selected agn , malizia et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the @xmath38/@xmath42 ratio of type 1 agn is typically around 0.7 , decreasing progressively as the absorption increases ; compton thick objects are easily recognized for having negligible absorption and a ratio below 0.02 .    in conclusion",
    ", these four ratios can provide an independent way to establish which is the dominant component between agn and starburst and , at the same time , they are a powerful tool in the detection of compton thick sources when the x - ray spectral analysis is not sufficient to recognize them . here , the optical spectra provide information on the [ o iii ] flux and the x - ray spectroscopy on the x - ray one .",

    ", we can conclude that most agn in the sample are dominated by an active nucleus rather than by starburst activity .",

    "fairall 272 is also a radio emitter , detected in the nvss catalog with a 20 cm flux of @xmath69 mjy ; as none of the other nearby galaxies is detected at this frequency , it is likely that fairall 272 is the most active galaxy of the group .",

    "in this case also , the line shapes and ratios indicate that this is a seyfert 2 galaxy . in view of the optical classification",
    "an absorbed power law is preferred to an unabsorbed flat spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath31/h@xmath28 flux ratio of 6.1 provides a dereddened [ o iii ] flux of @xmath77 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 and the diagnostic ratios indicate that this is a compton thin agn ( see table  [ tab7 ] ) .",
    "this substantially confirms the x - ray characterization of the source as a not heavily absorbed agn .",
    "this _ swift _ object coincides with the galaxy mrk 704 ( @xmath78 = 0.029 ; e.g. , hewitt & burbidge 1991 ) , which has been detected earlier in x - rays by _ rosat _ ( schwope et al . 2000 ) and _ asca _ , and is listed in the _ rxte _ slew survey ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "this galaxy is detected in the radio by the nvss survey with a 20 cm flux of @xmath79 mjy ; it is also an iras source and a 2mass extended object .",
    "the source has been classified in the literature as a seyfert galaxy but of different types ranging from 1 to 1.5 ( see for example a compendium in nagao , taniguchi & murayama 2000 ) ; it is also considered a peculiar type of seyfert 1 agn ( i.e. a `` polar scattered '' object ) as it has spectropolarimetric properties consistent with those found in type 2 seyfert galaxies despite its type 1 optical classification ( nagao , taniguchi & murayama 2000 ) .",
    "according to recent modeling , `` polar scattered '' seyfert 1 are those viewed at an inclination very close to 45@xmath19 , such that the line of sight passes through the outer layers of the torus whereas type 1 and 2 seyfert galaxies have inclinations lower and greater than 45@xmath19 respectively ( smith et al . 2004 ; hoffman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this latter fact seems to be more consistent with an intermediate optical classification : given that the broad line region ( blr ) is obscured by a dusty torus , the emission lines would appear with a composite profile consisting of both narrow and broad emissions .",
    "the x - ray information on this object also suggests that we are dealing with a peculiar object .",
    "ajello et al . ( 2006a ) reported inconsistencies between the bat and xrt spectra and further suggested , through the analysis of archival _ asca _ data , that the source might be in the compton thick regime , in contrast with its optical classification as a type 1 agn .",
    "this prompted our optical follow - up observations in order to assess the spectral characteristics of this object relatively close in time to the _ swift _ measurement .    due to the low statistical quality of the first xrt observation ,",
    "only the last three measurements have been taken into account for the spectral analysis .",
    "all data sets are compatible with each other being well fitted with a steep ( @xmath72 @xmath01.81.9 ) power law having mild absorption ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "there was a change in flux ( @xmath060% ) between the three xrt observations separated by a few months , but no variation within the individual measurements .",

    "the spectrum , and a h@xmath28/[o iii ] flux ratio of ( @xmath02.3 ) , together imply a seyfert 1.2 agn classification for this galaxy . from the observed wavelengths of narrow features , we determine a redshift @xmath82 , in agreement with previous measurements .",

    "asca _ observed swift j0918.5 + 1618 on may 12 1998 for an effective exposure time , for the gis instrument , of @xmath038 ks .",
    "a fit to the gis spectra with a simple power law seen through galactic absorption provides a poor fit to the data ( @xmath84 ) and a flat photon index ( @xmath72 @xmath01 ) , suggesting the presence of more complex absorption .",
    "we therefore applied a partial covering model , as observed in other intermediate seyfert galaxies like mrk 6 ( malizia et al . 2003 ) , mrk 1152 ( quadrelli et al . 2003 ) and 4u 134460 ( piconcelli et al .",

    "inspection of the residuals around the expected iron line position suggests the presence of such a feature .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of this extra component further improves the fit ( @xmath87 for two degrees of freedom ) and gives a column density of @xmath0@xmath88 @xmath2 covering @xmath061@xmath4 of the source ( see in figure  [ spec0918contnh ] and a narrow line at 6.4 kev with an @xmath89 of @xmath0233 ev , which is typical of seyfert 1 galaxies ( turner et al . 1997 ) . with this best - fit model ( see table  [ tab4 ] and figure  [ spec0918asca ] ) , the power law photon index is 1.5 , similar to that observed in other agn showing complex absorption .",
    "extrapolation of the _ asca _ best - fit to the 10100 kev energy band provides a flux consistent with the bat one .    in order to search for consistency between the _ asca _ and xrt results , we re - fitted the whole xrt data set with the _ asca _ best - fit model , finding an equally acceptable fit ( @xmath90 ) ; however , in this case , the column density was much lower ( @xmath0@xmath91 @xmath2 ) while the covering fraction was compatible with the _ asca _ measurement .",
    "this is very similar to what has been observed in similar sources where the absorption changes but the covering fraction remains constant ( see , for example , malizia et al .",

    "this is further confirmed by our diagnostic ratios , which locate the object in a region populated by compton thin seyfert galaxies ( see table  [ tab7 ] ) .",

    "our xrt data of swift j1009.34250 are well described by our baseline model plus another power law , having the same photon index , but absorbed only by the galactic column density ; the extra power law component is required ( at a confidence level @xmath10 99.99% in the combined spectrum and in the range 95.499.99% in each single pointing ) to account for excess emission observed below 2 kev ( see figure  [ spec1009 ] ) .",
    "the observed column density is 34@xmath96 @xmath2 , well below the compton thick regime .",

    "this corresponds to a luminosity distance @xmath55 = 159 mpc and gives a luminosity of ( 4.58.4)@xmath56 erg s@xmath3 in the 210 kev energy band .",

    "at least 2 type 11.5 objects show absorption in excess of the galactic value ; particularly interesting is the case of swift j0918.5 + 1618 ( mrk 704 ) in which the absorption is complex and may be linked to the polar scattered nature of the source . at most 3 objects ( swift j0444.1 + 2813 , swift j0601.98636 and swift j1238.92720 )",
    "could be compton thick .",
    "however , in the case of swift j0444.1 + 2813 and swift j1238.92720 the diagnostic ratios provide controversial results : while the @xmath38/@xmath131 ratio indicates a compton thick object , two other ratios suggest a compton thin nature .",
    "both the upper limit on the iron line @xmath89 and the short - term variability argue against a compton thick nature for swift j0444.1 + 2813 . in the case of swift j1238.92720 , the x - ray data analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption with @xmath50 @xmath0@xmath132 @xmath2 and of a 6.4 kev iron line with an @xmath89 @xmath0500 ev , and suggests that we are dealing with a borderline source , heavily absorbed , but not truly compton thick .",
    "the third source , swift j0601.98636 is probably the best candidate compton thick object in the entire sample .",
    "overall , our findings emphasize the need for hard x - ray surveys to discover and properly sample the population of absorbed agns .",
    "we thank stefano bernabei and roberto gualandi for the assistance at the telescope in loiano , and claudio aguilera and arturo gomez for their support during observations at ctio .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center ; the usno - a2.0 and 2mass catalogs ; the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ; the asi scientific data center ; and the hyperleda catalog operated at the observatoire de lyon , france .",
    "this research has been supported by asi under contracts i/008/07/0 and i/023/05 .",
    "this is the only source in our list which is not extragalactic .",
    "it coincides in position with the bright _ rosat _ all sky survey source ( rass ) 1rxs j073237.6133113 ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the xrt spectrum ( ajello et al . 2006a ) indicates that either a power law with photon index @xmath133 , or a raymond - smith model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) with a temperature of 60 kev are a good fit to the data ; in both cases , the hydrogen column density is below 10@xmath134 @xmath2 , which implies a rather small distance from earth .",
    "a reanalysis of the data by wheatley , marsh & clarkson ( 2006 ) showed that a partial covering absorption model allows the fitted temperature to drop to a value of @xmath020 kev .",
    "our own analysis of the xrt data are in agreement with the wheatley , marsh & clarkson ( 2006 ) results , providing a best - fit model of a partially covering absorber ( @xmath50 @xmath0@xmath51 @xmath2 and @xmath135 @xmath060% ) plus a thermal component ( mekal model in xspec , see mewe , gronenschild & van der oord 1985 ) having an average @xmath136 of @xmath015 kev ( see figure  [ spec0732 ] and table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "we therefore confirm previous findings both for individual observations and for the average spectrum ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "masetti et al .",
    "( 2006e ) stressed that the _ swift _ xrt error box encompasses two objects ; the brighter one ( with @xmath26 @xmath012.4 ) has the spectrum of a normal g / k - type galactic star .",
    "the fainter one ( with @xmath26 @xmath014.2 ) , located @xmath010@xmath14 southeast with respect to the brighter object , is instead the true optical counterpart : spectroscopy reveals h@xmath31 , h@xmath28 , he i @xmath295875 and he ii @xmath294686 in emission at redshift zero , superimposed on a very blue and otherwise featureless continuum ( figure  [ opt0732 ] ) .",
    "these signatures are typical of the accretion disk of a galactic x - ray binary .    marsh et al .",
    "( 2006 ) subsequently found that the counterpart proposed by masetti et al .",
    "( 2006e ) resolves into two stars approximately 1@xmath14.8 apart and lying along a north - east / south - west axis , and that the actual counterpart is the northeastern star of the close pair .",
    "this star is also approximately half as bright as its companion in the g optical filter .",
    "after this report , optical and x - ray follow - up observations revealed a pulsation period ( 512.42 s , patterson et al .",
    "2006 ; wheately , marsh & clarkson ( 2006 ) ) and an orbital periodicity ( 0.2335 d , thorstensen et al .",
    "2006 ) , which suggest that this object could be classified as an intermediate polar ( ip ) magnetic cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "indeed , the optical spectrum we obtained ( fig .  [ optical ] , central left panel ) shows that the @xmath137 of he ii ( @xmath138 )   and h@xmath28 ( @xmath139 )   have a ratio typical of ip cvs .",
    "in addition , the observed inverted h@xmath31/h@xmath28 balmer ratio ( @xmath02.2 ) is often found in this class of objects ; it also suggests negligible absorption towards the source , in agreement with the x - ray data .    considering no interstellar absorption , an absolute optical magnitude m@xmath140 @xmath09 and an intrinsic color index @xmath141 @xmath00 mag ( warner 1995 ) for the object , and assuming that the true counterpart contributes to roughly one third of the total @xmath26 magnitude ( @xmath26 @xmath014.2 ) from the close star pair , we derive a distance of @xmath0190 pc .",
    "this implies a 210 kev luminosity for this source of @xmath0@xmath142 erg s@xmath3 .",

    "<S> the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) is performing a high galactic latitude survey in the 14195 kev band at a flux limit of @xmath0@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , leading to the discovery of new high energy sources , most of which have not so far been properly classified . </S>",
    "<S> a similar work has also been performed with the _ rxte _ slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 kev , many of which are still unclassified . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up observations with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) provide , for many of these objects , source localization with a positional accuracy of few arcsec , thus allowing the search for optical counterparts to be more efficient and reliable . we present the results of optical / x - ray follow - up studies of 11 _ swift _ bat detections and one agn detected in the _ rxte _ slew survey , aimed at identifying their longer - wavelength counterparts and at assessing their nature . these data allowed , for the first time , the optical classification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them . for another object , a more refined optical classification than that available in the literature is also provided . for the remaining sources , </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to the x - ray measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of 6 seyfert 2 galaxies , 5 seyferts of intermediate type 1.21.8 , and one object of galactic nature - an intermediate polar ( i.e. , magnetic ) cataclysmic variable . out of the 11 agns , </S>",
    "<S> 8 ( @xmath070@xmath4 ) including 2 seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5 , are absorbed with @xmath5 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> up to 3 objects could be compton thick ( i.e. @xmath6 @xmath2 ) , but only in one case ( swift j0609.18636 ) does all the observational evidence strongly suggests this possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the present data demonstrate the capability of coordinated hard x - ray and optical observations to discover absorbed agns . </S>"
