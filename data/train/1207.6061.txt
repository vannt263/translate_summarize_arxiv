    "a critical issue in unlocking the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates is determining the spectrum of bosonic [ phononic or electronic ] fluctuations that strongly interact with the electrons , and which can drive a variety of instabilities and exotic physics .",
    "in particular , what is the energy scale of the relevant fluctuations : if high-@xmath1 superconductivity is produced by fluctuations at a low energy scale comparable to the magnetic resonance mode@xcite , then the bosons responsible for pairing  the so - called ` glue '  could be phonons or magnetic excitations . if on the other hand higher energy fluctuations ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or charge transfer scales ) play an important role@xcite , a novel electronic mechanism would be clearly indicated .",
    "recently there have been a number of attempts to extract self energies and fluctuation spectra of the cuprates from angle- resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , tunneling , and optical spectra .",
    "most experimental probes find strong coupling to a low - energy boson@xcite  often with significant isotope effect@xcite .",
    "in addition , arpes finds a high - energy kink ( hek ) suggestive of significant coupling to electronic bosons in the 300 - 600  mev range.@xcite these bosons are believed to be predominantly magnetic,@xcite with charge bosons at higher energies up to the charge - transfer energy @xmath42  ev .",
    "in contrast , recent attempts to extract the fluctuation spectra or the ` optical glue'@xcite functions from optical measurements@xcite find little evidence for spectral weight above @xmath4300  mev , suggesting that high energy scales are unimportant in the cuprates .",
    "however , these analyses are generally restricted to energies below @xmath41  ev , thereby precluding the possibility of fluctuations at the @xmath42  ev charge transfer energy scale ( the @xmath3 scale of the one band hubbard model).@xcite    several recent attempts at quasi - first - principles calculations of the optical spectra have found that the cuprate intraband optical spectrum extends up to @xmath42.5  ev , with a residual charge transfer gap , associated with the incoherent part of the band , persisting well into the overdoped regime@xcite .",
    "this suggests that optical glue studies should be extended into the higher energy regime , to provide definitive answers about the role of charge transfer excitations in high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "this is important since several optical studies@xcite have found evidence that the onset of superconductivity affects spectral weight in an energy range extending beyond 1  ev .    in the present paper ,",
    "we explore how the results of realistic self energy calculations can be used to guide the analysis of the optical glue .",
    "we explore the role of anisotropy , and clarify just what the glue function actually measures .",
    "we point out a simple correction to commonly used formulas for self energy , which largely eliminates the problem of negative scattering rates .",
    "we find that an important contribution to the high - energy fluctuations has been ` hiding in plain sight ' .",
    "and we provide an example of an optical glue recovery which includes the high energy contribution , and which bears a striking similarity to the calculated results .",
    "our study thus resolves a puzzling discrepancy between optical vs other experiments related to the nature of bosonic fluctuations , and clearly demonstrates that experimental attempts to extract the optical glue need to probe a higher energy range to weigh in on the issue of a possible @xmath3-scale glue involved in the mechanism of high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section iia shows how including self energy effects in optical calculations can provide insight into attempts to extract fluctuation , or ` pairing glue ' functions from optical experiments .",
    "section iib provides an example of extracting glue functions from real optical data .",
    "section iii describes numerical experiments to test the accuracy of the glue extraction , while section iv compares the optical self energy to arpes - derived self energies .",
    "sections v and vi give a discussion and conclusions , respectively .",
    "details of our self energy calculations are presented in an appendix .",
    "we first briefly comment on how the optical ` glue ' is measured and what it really represents .",
    "one starts with the optical conductivity @xmath5 , which can be calculated following allen@xcite . for a @xmath6-independent @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi function . in optical glue studies ,",
    "an ` optical self energy ' function is derived from the experimental optical conductivity @xmath10 by assuming it to be of an extended drude form@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the plasma frequency , @xmath13 the carrier density , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the electronic charge and mass respectively .",
    "this can also be written in terms of a frequency dependent scattering time @xmath16 and effective mass @xmath17 as @xmath18    an important question is , how is @xmath19 related to the self energy function @xmath7 ?",
    "two approaches are commonly employed , which we call method i , which simply assumes : @xmath20 and method ii:@xcite @xmath21 we test these schemes in section iii , by comparing self energies extracted from calculated optical spectra with the input self energies , calculated using a gw model@xcite appropriate for the cuprates .",
    "we find similar results for both methods : they can approximately reproduce @xmath22 at energies below @xmath41  ev , but both methods have problems in the pseudogap regime .    in the gw method , the self energy is calculated as the convolution of the green s function @xmath23 and an interaction @xmath24 which is @xmath25 times a susceptibility , which represents the spectrum of electronic bosonic modes ( see the appendix for details ) . for cuprates with @xmath26-wave pairing ,",
    "the true pairing glue is given by the @xmath26-wave average of this @xmath27-dependent function .",
    "in contrast , the optical spectra are measured at @xmath28 , and provide no information on this anisotropy . hence optical experiments",
    "can only measure an average @xmath29 , which we nevertheless denote as @xmath30 .",
    "below we show that @xmath30 approximately represents the @xmath27-averaged susceptibility @xmath31/2 , \\label{eq:00a}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 the hubbard @xmath3 , @xmath32 the imaginary part of @xmath33 , @xmath34 [ @xmath35 the charge [ spin ] susceptibility , and we neglect the distinction between @xmath30 and @xmath36 , where the latter is a transport eliashberg function .",
    "also @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "within rpa @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the bare susceptibility as calculated in the local - density approximation [ lda ] , and the dielectric constant can be written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 , a background dielectric constant .",
    "thus optical measurements determine the @xmath27-averaged susceptibility as a function of energy .",
    "this can be compared to susceptibilities measured in other spectroscopies , such as arpes , to determine the spectra of the bosons which strongly couple to electrons , but can not directly provide information on how well these bosons contribute to @xmath26-wave superconductivity .",
    "when the susceptibility is replaced by its @xmath27-average , the formula for the self energy can be simplified , appendix a. at @xmath44 , for @xmath45 , it becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47/2n_{av}$ ] is the electron - hole averaged density of states ( dos ) , and @xmath48 is the average of the dos over the energy range of interest , chosen to make @xmath49 dimensionless .",
    "then for method ii @xmath50 where @xmath51    we note that in many previous inversion schemes the dos is approximated by a constant . in this case",
    "eq .  [ eq:4 ]",
    "becomes@xcite @xmath52 we use the subscript ` 0 ' on @xmath30 to denote that it is assumes a constant dos . according to eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] the glue function can become negative unless @xmath53 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath54.@xcite we find that @xmath30 and @xmath55 can display very different energy dependencies as can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig:3](a ) and [ fig:3](b ) below . a similar problem arises with method ii.@xcite many groups use a finite - temperature version of this result@xcite . from eq .",

    "[ eq:2 ] , and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the glue function corresponding to eq .",
    "[ eq:3a ] .",
    "while this works for phonon contributions to the self energy , this substitution is not appropriate over a 2 - 3  ev energy range .",
    "we find that @xmath22 can not be monotonic over the full bandwidth , and that may be why previous analyses often had problems with negative @xmath30 , or why they are restricted to fairly low energies .",
    "in contrast , these problems do not arise with eqs .",
    "[ eq:4 ] ,  [ eq:3a ] .",
    "the question remains , what is the appropriate dos ?",
    "this has two aspects .",
    "first , since the optical self energy @xmath60 involves the sum of the electron and hole self energies , one should use the average of the electron and hole dos , @xmath49 in eq .",
    "but which dos ? in the gw approach , one could consider using either the bare @xmath61 or the fully dressed dos @xmath62 .",
    "the use of @xmath62 is prohibitively expensive , since to calculate it requires knowledge of the glue function , which we are trying to extract . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath61 can be directly calculated from the lda dispersion and should work progressively better with overdoping , as correlation effects weaken . for simplicity , in the present analysis we use @xmath61 .",
    "this approximation should have no effect on the qualitative features we are describing .",

    "the theoretical conductivity consists of a drude term associated with the coherent part of the electronic band plus an effective interband term associated with the incoherent spectral weight , a residue of the upper and lower magnetic bands .",
    "while the theory underestimates the incoherent spectral weight [ a known shortcoming of the qp - gw model]@xcite , it does capture an enhanced conductivity near 1.5  ev , associated with this residual charge transfer band@xcite .",

    ", the self energy calculated by method i ( violet dotted line in fig .  [ fig:3b](a ) ) fits the data well below 1.5  ev , but falls off too rapidly at higher energies .",

    "1(b ) , it can be seen that the present model does not well reproduce the experimental loss function , perhaps because the hubbard model does not describe the charge susceptibility of eq .",

    "differences above 1  ev may be due to limitations in extracting the true @xmath7 from @xmath19 , as discussed in the following section .",
    "we note that the contribution of the loss function to the optical glue has not been previously recognized .",
    "having a realistic scheme for calculating optical spectra allows us to test how well glue functions can be extracted , by inverting calculated data and comparing the inverted with the input susceptibilities .",
    "here we briefly describe the results of several tests we have carried out .",
    "we first note that while the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath32 is important , the self energy is a convolution over @xmath33 and the green s function , and we find that its momentum - dependence is relatively weak in the overdoped regime .",
    "this is important , since when the self energy has a significant momentum dependence , the kubo formula for conductivity includes significant vertex corrections@xcite , which to our knowledge have not been included in any inversion scheme .",
    "fortunately , the weak momentum dependence of the self energy that we find suggests that a self energy extracted from optical studies could still be fairly representative .    since optical techniques can only find a momentum - averaged glue function , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we address the issue of the extent to which the average glue function can reproduce the self energy.@xcite we denote this momentum - averaged glue function as @xmath71 . to avoid tensor complications we limit our analysis to the overdoped normal state spectra and analyze only the rpa magnetic susceptibility @xmath72 , with bare susceptibility @xmath73 and @xmath3 being the hubbard @xmath3 . in fig .",

    "it can be seen that averaging before integrating underestimates the magnitude of @xmath76 , by about 20% ( dashed line ) , but approximately reproduces the shape of @xmath76 .",
    "hence we estimate that the average glue function extracted from optical spectra should have the correct frequency dependence , but could be overestimated by @xmath420% in intensity .    once the self energy is known , we can invert it to try to recover the susceptibility . here as a test case we take a derivative of @xmath7 , eq .",

    "arpes experiments find the coherent band in bi2212 is renormalized by a factor of @xmath101 with coherent spectral weight extending to a band bottom at the @xmath102-point near -0.5  ev,@xcite whereas incoherent spectral weight extends @xmath103  ev below the fermi level .",
