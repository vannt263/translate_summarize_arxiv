    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath8 , the coupling of the @xmath9 quark to the @xmath10 quark , is a fundamental parameter of the standard model .",
    "it is one of the smallest and least known elements of the ckm matrix . with the increasingly precise measurements of decay - time - dependent @xmath11 asymmetries in @xmath12-meson",
    "decays , in particular the angle @xmath13  @xcite , improved measurements of the magnitude of @xmath8 will allow for stringent experimental tests of the standard model mechanism for @xmath11 violation  @xcite .",
    "this is best illustrated in terms of the unitarity triangle , the graphical representation of the unitarity condition for the ckm matrix , for which the length of the side that is opposite to the angle @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the extraction of @xmath14 is a challenge , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "experimentally , the principal challenge is to separate the signal @xmath15 decays from the 50 times larger @xmath16 background .",
    "this can be achieved by selecting regions of phase space in which this background is highly suppressed . in the rest frame of the @xmath12 meson ,",
    "the kinematic endpoint of the electron spectrum is @xmath17 for the dominant @xmath18 decays and @xmath19 for @xmath20 decays .",
    "thus the spectrum above 2.3  @xmath21is dominated by electrons from @xmath20 transitions .",
    "this allows for a relatively precise measurement , largely free from  background , in a 300 @xmath22interval that covers approximately 10% of the total electron spectrum for charmless semileptonic @xmath12 decays . in the @xmath23 rest frame ,",
    "the finite momenta of the @xmath12 mesons cause additional spread of the electron momenta of @xmath24@xmath22 , extending the endpoints to higher momenta .",
    "the weak decay rate for @xmath25 can be calculated at the parton level .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 refers to the @xmath9-quark mass . to relate the semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath12 meson to @xmath14",
    ", the parton - level calculations have to be corrected for perturbative and non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "these corrections can be calculated using various techniques : heavy quark expansions ( hqe )  @xcite and qcd factorization  @xcite .",
    "both approaches separate perturbative from non - perturbative expressions and sort terms in powers of @xmath29 .",
    "hqe is appropriate for the calculations of total inclusive @xmath12 decay rates and for partial @xmath12 decay rates integrated over sufficiently large regions of phase space where the mass and momentum of the final state hadron are large compared to @xmath30 .",
    "qcd factorization is better suited for calculations of partial rates and spectra near the kinematic boundaries where the hadronic mass is small . in this region",
    "the spectra are affected by the distribution of the @xmath9-quark momentum inside the @xmath12 meson  @xcite , which can be described by a structure or shape function ( sf ) , in addition to weak annihilation and other non - perturbative effects .",
    "extrapolation from the limited momentum range near the endpoint to the full spectrum is a difficult task , because the sf can not be calculated . to leading order",
    ", the sf should be universal for all @xmath31 transitions ( here @xmath32 represents a light quark )  @xcite .",
    "several functional forms for the sf , which generally depend on two parameters related to the mass and kinetic energy of the @xmath9-quark , @xmath33 or @xmath28 , and @xmath34 or @xmath35 , have been proposed .",
    "the values and precise definitions of these parameters depend on the specific ansatz for the sf , the mass renormalization scheme , and the renormalization scale chosen .    in this paper , we present a measurement of the inclusive electron momentum spectrum in charmless semileptonic @xmath12 decays , averaged over charged and neutral @xmath12 mesons , near the kinematic endpoint .",
    "we report measurements of the partial branching fractions in five overlapping momentum intervals .",
    "the upper limit is fixed at 2.6 @xmath21 , while the lower limit varies from 2.0 @xmath21to 2.4 @xmath21 . by extending the interval for the signal extraction down to 2.0 @xmath21 , we capture about 25% of the total signal electron spectrum , but also much larger @xmath36 backgrounds .",
    "inclusive measurements of @xmath14 have been performed by several experiments operating at the @xmath37 resonance , namely argus  @xcite , cleo  @xcite ,  @xcite , and belle  @xcite , and experiments operating at the @xmath38 resonance , namely l3  @xcite , aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite , and opal  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on a method similar to the one used in previous measurements of the lepton spectrum near the kinematic endpoint  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here supersede those of the preliminary analysis reported by the  collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of @xmath14 relies on two different theoretical calculations of the differential decay rates for @xmath39 and @xmath5 : the original work by defazio and neubert ( dn )  @xcite , and kagan and neubert  @xcite , and the more comprehensive recent calculations by bosch , lange , neubert , and paz ( blnp )  @xcite .",
    "the dn calculations allow for the extrapolation of the observed partial @xmath0 decay rate above a certain electron momentum to the total inclusive @xmath0 decay rate using the measured sf parameters and a subsequent translation of the total decay rate to @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties on the rate predictions are estimated to be of order 1020% .",
    "the blnp authors have presented a systematic treatment of the sf effects , incorporated all known corrections to the differential decay rates , and provided an interpolation between the hqe and the sf regions .",
    "they have also performed a detailed analysis of the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the calculations directly relate the partial decay rate to @xmath14 .",
    "while the calculations by blnp are to supersede the earlier work by dn , we use both approaches to allow for a direct comparison of the two calculations , and also a comparison with previous measurements based on the dn calculations . we adopt the sf parameters extracted by the  collaboration : for the dn method we rely on the photon spectrum in @xmath5 decays  @xcite ; for the more recent blnp method , we also use sf parameters derived from the photon spectrum , its moments , the hadron - mass and lepton - energy moments in inclusive @xmath6 decays  @xcite , and the combination of all moments measured by the  collaboration  @xcite .",
