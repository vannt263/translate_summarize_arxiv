    "scientists were surprised in the early 1950s , when it became clear that the  radio stars \" in fact were extragalactic and hence very energetic , and the general idea of a calm orderly universe had to be questioned . in later years",
    "the discovery of black holes , quasars , pulsars , and other exotic objects changed the view completely , and brought us to the _ violent _ universe as we understand it today .    in a prescient article ,",
    "rees ( 1966 ) suggested bulk relativistic motion as an explanation for the rapid variations in flux density seen in quasars ; and he also predicted the phenomenon of superluminal apparent transverse velocity , which was discovered five years later . at that point",
    "most people believed that cosmic jets contained relativistic jets of plasma , but what process could collimate and accelerate whole solar masses of material to relativistic speeds ? the current paradigm is that a giant black hole lies at the center of a galaxy , and the process of accretion combined with a magnetic field generates the bulk relativistic flow .",
    "the details of this scenario are not well understood , but gravitational accretion is the only known means for generating the required energy per unit volume .    in this paper",
    "we review the radio observations that provide evidence for relativistic motion .",
    "the plan of the paper is to successively discuss frequency shift , morphology and doppler boosting , brightness temperature measured with interferometers and estimated with intrinsic variability , interstellar scintillations , inverse - compton x - rays , and superluminal motion . individually , and",
    "especially taken together , these make a convincing case for relativistic motion in the radio jets .",
    "this conclusion is independent of any specific cosmology .",
    "relativistic motion implies that the observed radiation patterns are narrow , that doppler boosting increases the observed flux density , and that the observed time scale is shrunk below that in the frame of the agn .",
    "these affect the observable quantities ; namely , frequency , luminosity , apparent transverse speed , and variability ; and there should be statistical relations among them .",
    "we briefly touch on this in  4 .",
    "a number of earlier papers have discussed the different types of observational data bearing on relativistic motion .",
    "we mention only a few of them here : @xcite compared x - ray and vlbi data to derive doppler factors and compared them with other beaming indicators ; vermeulen and cohen ( 1994 ) assembled all the existing data on superluminal sources and analyzed several models involving the distributions of lorentz factor and of the ratio of pattern to beam velocity ; lister and marscher ( 1997 ) made monte carlo calculations of distributions of the measureable parameters , and of their correlations ; and @xcite estimated lorentz factors and also the intrinsic temperature in the synchrotron sources .",
    "these past surveys mainly used inhomogeneous data culled from the literature .",
    "however , two large surveys on the vlba , at 5 mhz @xcite and 15 ghz ( kellermann  2004 , hereafter k04 ) are now bearing fruit , and analyses with these superior data sets should soon give much better results .",
    "here we list some formulae , for later convenience . assume a relativistic luminous plasma blob with velocity @xmath0 and lorentz factor @xmath1 .",
    "if it is moving at angle @xmath2 to the line - of - sight ( los ) then its doppler factor is    @xmath3    the observed frequency is @xmath4 where the superscript * refers to the coordinate frame of the moving plasma .",
    "non - starred quantities are in the frame comoving with the agn .",
    "the brightness temperature has the same transformation law as the frequency :    @xmath5    the observed flux from a point source is    @xmath6    while for a jet the exponent is 2 , and in general the exponent can be between 2 and 3 @xcite .",
    "if a source component has proper motion @xmath7 then it has an apparent transverse speed @xmath8 , where d is the metric distance to the source . in terms of the source geometry ,",
    "@xmath9    graphs of this relation are in figure  [ figthree ] .",
    "several galactic sources show radio jets that are analogous to those seen in the high - luminosity extragalactic sources .",
    "ss 433 contains a jet with radio - bright components which move out from the core , and the jet changes orientation in a way that is consistent with precession .",
    "this source also exhibits frequency - shifted balmer lines that , when tracked over time , show conclusively that the speed of the line - emitting clouds is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this value is not relativistic , but it is well above values otherwise associated with stars , including supernovae shock waves . if ss 433 , a compact stellar object , can generate a jet with @xmath10 , then we might expect that an extragalactic object a billion times more luminous can produce a jet that is relativistic .",
    "early imaging showed that many radio galaxies contain lobes more - or - less symmetrically located across the galaxy , and some objects also contain a bright point source at the center .",
    "a good deal of speculation went into the question of how these lobes were formed and energized .",
    "they were hundreds or even thousands of kiloparsecs from the center , but their synchrotron lifetimes were only a million years .",
    "if they were ejected from the galaxy it must have been at relativistic speed , otherwise there would be a lifetime problem .",
    "alternately , there might be some kind of continuous beams that kept the lobes energized ( eg ryle and longair 1967 ) .",
    "vla images then showed that the beams did exist , and that there could be continuous feeding of the lobes .",
    "however , in most cases the beams were strongly asymmetric ; one side typically was much stronger than the other .",
    "another clue came from vlbi high - resolution studies .",
    "many compact sources were linear but strongly non - symmetric ; a bright  core \" was at one end of a jet that had a spectral gradient such that the core had the flattest spectrum .",
    "see k04 for many examples .",
    "an important discovery was that the inner jet nearly always pointed in the direction of the stronger of the two outer jets .",
    "how could there be one - sided inner structure with two - sided outer structure ?",
    "most astronomers accepted the idea that the jets contained relativistic beams , and doppler boosting enhanced the forward beam relative to the backward beam .    in 1987 the  laing - garington effect \" was discovered @xcite ; this was essentially regarded as a proof of the relativity hypothesis .",
    "the two outer radio lobes of a radio source typically have different amounts of faraday rotation , and the lobe with the weaker faraday effect is nearly always on the jet side .",
    "it must be in front , because on average its radiation goes through less plasma than for the one in back , the non - jet lobe .",
    "the visible jet then is the one in front , and the only convincing reason that has been offered for this is doppler boosting .",
    "the front - to - back ratio of the jets , @xmath11 , is typically greater than 10 .",
    "this does not call for a very high value of @xmath12 , although 3c 273 is exceptionally one - sided , with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the compact inner jets often have @xmath11 = several thousand , which requires @xmath14 ; i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , these are the extreme values of @xmath12 and @xmath2 , and more likely values are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these calculations assume that the jet and counterjet have the same intrinsic luminosity .",
    "note that the measured high values of @xmath11 imply small values of @xmath2 . _ the strongly one - sided objects must be aimed close to the los . _",
    "what of the mis - directed ones , those more numerous objects not close to the los ?",
    "they are not doppler - boosted ; and in fact most will be deboosted and hence weak .",
    "the mis - directed objects are generally thought to be radio galaxies , and indeed these typically have weak cores @xcite .",
    "the strong , compact , one - sided , flat - spectrum sources often also show superluminal motion , which also requires an orientation close to the los .",
    "( see  3.6 ) . given the number of sources that are known",
    "to be highly aligned with the los , the parent population is likely to be very large @xcite .",
    "this topic , however , is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "a relativistic plasma will produce synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths and also x - rays , from the inverse - compton process . for reasonable values of the magnetic field",
    "the maximum intrinsic temperature that the plasma can have , if it is in dynamic equilibrium , is @xmath19 k , because at a higher temperature second order scattering becomes important and rapidly quenchs the plasma @xcite .",
    "somewhat similar arguments have been made by singal ( 1986 ) and by @xcite who derive @xmath20 k and @xmath21 k , respectively , as upper limits .",
    "however , readhead ( 1994 ) has argued that because at @xmath22 k the magnetic and kinetic energies in the plasma are very far out of balance , a lower equilibrium temperature , @xmath23 k , is more likely to be found .",
    "-8 truecm    measurements made with vlbi show that the temperature can be higher than these values .",
    "figure  [ figone]a shows the distribution of @xmath24 measured with the vlba at 15 ghz @xcite , and figure  [ figone]b shows the distribution measured with the space vlbi program vsop at 5 mhz @xcite .",
    "for both the vlba and vsop results , some of the measured values are lower limits .",
    "the two distributions are similar and show that some sources have @xmath24 an order of magnitude and more above the ssc and other limits and estimates for @xmath24 described above .",
    "theoretical ways of exceeding the limits have been proposed , including a non - equilibrium plasma ( slysh 1992 ) , and coherent radiation processes ( benford and lesch 1998 ) .",
    "however , we prefer ( with most others ) to invoke eq ( 2 ) and explain the discrepancy with relativistic motion .",
    "we expect that most sources will have @xmath25 k in accord with the estimates of readhead and others , although we also think there might be a distribution of @xmath26 with a small number of sources approaching @xmath22 . in any event",
    ", it is clear that many sources must contain relativistic beams with @xmath27 and more .",
    "note that this discussion and the one based on morphology are independent and complementary .",
    "they both require doppler factors up to @xmath28 .        many agn show rapid variability , with time scale @xmath29 as short as a few weeks . with the assumption that @xmath29 is limited by the light - crossing time , and with the aid of a model",
    ", @xmath29 can be turned into an angular diameter .",
    "the  variability brightness temperature \" t@xmath30 can then be found from the flux in the outburst .",
    "however , eq ( 2 ) is not valid for converting these t@xmath30 to intrinsic values , @xmath31 , because the transformation of @xmath29 introduces another factor of @xmath32 , and @xmath29 enters twice in calculating the solid angle .",
    "hence , in this case ( 2 ) is replaced with    @xmath33    where @xmath26 is the intrinsic temperature in the plasma . with the assumption of a particular value for @xmath26 , eq ( 5 )",
    "can be used to calculate @xmath34 ; the cube root makes the estimate of @xmath34 somewhat insensitive to the model used in deriving the angular size . @xcite",
    "have used their flux monitoring data at 22 and 37 ghz to calculate @xmath35 and @xmath34 , for @xmath36 k. their histogram of @xmath34 is in figure  [ figtwo ] .",
    "their values have been converted to the cosmology we use in this paper , @xmath37 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath34 decreases steadily with @xmath34 up to @xmath38 .",
    "the model used in these calculations is an optically thick sphere of radius @xmath39 .",
    "-2 truecm   -4 truecm    if the interferometric data in figure  [ figone ] are converted to @xmath32 with the same intrinsic temperature as used for the variability , @xmath40 k , the @xmath32 are larger than the ones in figure  [ figtwo ] , and a higher temperature , around @xmath41 k , is needed to bring them into rough agreement .",
    "a detailed comparison can not be made because the selection criteria for the two data sets are very different ; and also because the interferometric data contain a number of lower limits on @xmath42 .",
    "some compact sources show rapid variability due to the passage of the earth through the irregular diffraction pattern produced by the interstellar medium .",
    "this interstellar scintillation can be as fast as a few hours , giving intraday variability , or idv .",
    "scattering theory gives an estimate of the distance to the screen , and the angular size of the background source .",
    "thus the brightness temperature can be estimated ; the method is analgous to vlbi , but with a longer baseline .",
    "analysis of the idv cases shows that the screen distance is only 10s of pc , and the angular scale is 10s of micro - arcsec @xcite .",
    "the best - determined case appears to be pks 0405385 @xcite , which has @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 , the value used by rickett .",
    "the value @xmath46 , while high , is not unprecedented , because the generally - accepted theory for @xmath12-ray bursts requires jets with @xmath47 or more .",
    "there are many agn jets with @xmath32 up to about 30 , ( fig  [ figtwo ] ) and a few with @xmath32 near 100 , but none have been found in - between .",
    "@xcite state that , if there were sources with variability time scale @xmath48 week at 22 and 37 ghz , they would have been found .",
    "however , in view of the selection biases in all these studies , we think it premature to generalize these statistics .",

    "the accepted explanation for this is relativistic motion , and @xmath32 can be estimated if the appropriate radio and x - ray measurements are made @xcite .",
    "the calculation is strongly dependent on the radio diameter , which has to be measured with vlbi .",
    "thus this method is closely allied to the vlbi temperature method (  3.3 ) .",
    "the x - rays should be measured simultaneously with the radio , and the radio observations should be made at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "these conditions are seldom met .",
    "nevertheless , calculations made from literature surveys ( eg ghisellini  1993 ) show that many flat - spectrum sources appear to require @xmath52 .",

    "since the minimum @xmath12 is approximately @xmath80 , a rough upper limit to @xmath78 is @xmath81 .",
    "we conclude that the histogram in figure  [ figsix ] is unlikely to be representative of the real values of @xmath2 ; a more probable distribution would be more peaked at small angles .",
    "lister and marscher ( 1997 ) show some plots of the distribution of @xmath80 and @xmath2 from monte - carlo simulations of observing a complete well - defined sample of relativistically boosted jets .",
    "we have begun to observe such a sample , in a continuation of the 15 ghz vlba survey called the mojave project @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the speed measured for the moving pattern is also the speed of the beam , but this often may be wrong @xcite .",
    "shocks will exist in the jet , and in some cases the moving blobs will be compressions due to the shocks @xcite . in these cases",
    "the pattern speed can be different from the underlying flow velocity . as an extreme case ,",
    "consider a standing shock wave set up at a bend in the jet ; the measured speed ( zero ) gives no information on the actual flow velocity .",
    "another possibility is that a beam contains two components , a narrow fast spine and a slower sheath . in this case",
    "the observed pattern speed might be a combination of the two speeds , although we might see only the spine , because its doppler boosting will be higher .",
    "other effects , including bending of the beam and evolution in the moving component , can also give erroneous speeds .",
    "nevertheless , in most cases the measured pattern velocity should be similar to the actual beam speed , because the speeds are roughly compatible with other relativity indicators .",
    "( see  4.4 ) .",
    "relativistic beams are generally accepted as the explanation for superluminal motion , but alternatives have been suggested and are still occasionally referred to .",
    "these can be grouped into two main categories .",
    "random    among the 110 sources of the 15-ghz survey , nearly all show expansion or zero velocity .",
    "the two sources with a statistically significant ( @xmath82 ) negative velocity can be reasonably explained with outward helical motion or with a bent jet , as an alternative to contraction .",
    "further , in most cases the motions are along a line , and the expansions can persist for up to a decade in distance from the core . in the two - sided source ngc",
    "1052 @xcite , the speeds are similar on the two sides .",
    "these motions are not random .    \\2 .",
    "non - beaming models    the light - echo model ( lynden - bell 1977 ) works for supernova remnants but not for jets in agn , because the predicted distribution of velocities does not match the data .",
    "the same problem arises for echoes in a dipole magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ekers & liang ( 1990 ) produced an ingenious model of a relativistic excitation wave in a jet , where the radiating material is stationary ;  it is not swept up by the wave .",
    "this suffers from the same problem with the distribution of velocities .",
    "these models do not have relativistic motion of the radiating material , so there is no doppler favoritism .",
    "the selected sources must be oriented randomly relative to the los . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution in figure  [ figsix ] , based only on the observed values of @xmath63 and without explicitly or implicitly assuming doppler boosting , shows that the orientations are not random , which would give a @xmath83 distribution .",
    "this result was quantified by @xcite with an analysis of the 12 strongest sources that were then known .",
    "each source has a solid angle associated with @xmath74 that can be compared with @xmath84 , the total available , in a manner analagous to a @xmath85 calculation .",
    "the result was that the probability that the objects were drawn from a randomly oriented parent population was small unless the hubble constant was well above any reasonable value .",
    "this calculation can now be repeated with a much better and larger sample , and with a current value for @xmath86 .",
    "the result for the fastest component that is rated e or g , for the 53 quasars that have s(15)@xmath87 jy ( the original limit of the 15-ghz survey ) , is that the probability that they were drawn from a randomly oriented parent population is @xmath88 .",
    "this is a strongly biased estimate because ( a ) a distribution based on a more probable angle , rather than the maximum angle , would have a smaller probability , and ( b ) every source with @xmath89 or @xmath90 was set to 90 degrees .",
    "thus the estimate for @xmath91 is conservative , and we conclude that the quasars are not oriented at random , but rather are preferentially close to the los . the models without doppler favoritism are not viable .",
    "an exception to this conclusion could arise if there were obscuration near the equatorial plane , so that small values of @xmath2 would be favored .",
    "however , we do not see how this could come about .",
    "the dust clouds invoked for optical obscuration are transparent at radio wavelengths , and free  free absorption at 15 ghz would require unreasonable densities and masses of plasma .",
    "the brightness temperature of a source can be determined with interferometry ( @xmath42 ) and also with flux density variations ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "comparisons of the two measures can help determine if the various assumptions underlying these determinations are valid .",
    "if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are measured then the doppler factor @xmath32 and the intrinsic temperature ( @xmath31 ) can be calculated with equations 2 and 5 .",
    "lhteenmki  ( 1999a ) have done this for several sets of sources , and found that most of the @xmath31 have a range around @xmath95 k. this is rather lower than the ssc limit but close to the other values discussed in  3.3 .",
    "this suggests that , although the detailed variability model commonly used is not too realistic , the results none - the - less should have some reliability , and the different measurements pertain to the same relativistic plasma . as discussed in  3.4.1 , the sets of @xmath32 found by the two methods are in rough agreement with @xmath96 .",
    "now we consider the relation between the variability doppler factor @xmath34 and the apparent transverse speed @xmath63 , and assume that the same plasma motion affects both phenomena , through the shrinkage of the time scale by the forward relativistic motion",
    ". they should be closely connected , but note that high @xmath34 can go with low @xmath63 , when @xmath97 . if @xmath98 and @xmath63 are known , we can calculate @xmath12 and @xmath2 from eqs 1 and 4 , but there is ambiguity because an assumed value of @xmath31 is required for @xmath34 .",

    "-6 truecm   and @xmath63 with @xmath110 k. arrows indicate upper limits.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] -1 truecm    figure  [ figeight ] shows the distribution of @xmath12 calculated from the @xmath112 points , with @xmath111 k. four sources have formally negative values of @xmath63 , and in figure  [ figeight ] they are plotted as upper limits at the @xmath82 position . the values above @xmath62 can be seen above the line in figure  [ figseven ] .",
    "two of them are within @xmath82 of @xmath62 , and the third , like all the points , has an unknown error connected with the variability doppler factor .",
    "the value @xmath113 k from the @xmath114 distribution is rather different from the value @xmath115 k from the comparison of interferometer and variability doppler factors .",
    "however , these agree within an order of magnitude and perhaps this is a success , given the many assumptions going into the analyses , and the large observational errors .",
    "we have described five independent sets of radio phenomena which show that there is relativistic motion in the compact jets of agn .",
    "these are the observations of morphology , interferometry , intrinsic variability , interstellar scintillations , and superluminal motion .",
    "x - ray measurements provide further confirmation , although these results are dependent on the vlbi measurements from which the brightness temperatures are determined .",
    "each of these phenomena has a theoretical difficulty which is readily alleviated by assuming that there is bulk relativistic motion towards the observer",
    ". the morphology , interferometry , interstellar scintillations , and the x - ray method are independent of redshift and hence of cosmology .",
    "interpretations based on intrinsic variability and on internal proper motion , however , require a knowledge of the distance to the source .",
    "the variability methods , and the interferometry method , require an assumption of an intrinsic temperature in the synchrotron cloud .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 peaks at low values and decreases to @xmath116 the lorentz factor @xmath12 is a more fundamental quantity than @xmath32 , but is harder to estimate .",
    "values estimated for @xmath12 range up to 34 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath63 and @xmath34 shows that the superluminal speeds and the variability doppler factors are roughly consistent with the standard relativistic motion paradigm , provided the intrinsic temperature in the synchrotron clouds is @xmath117 k. this value is below the various theoretical upper limits , and is close to readhead s estimate ( 1994 ) , based on equipartition between the energy in the particles and that in the magnetic field .",
