    "the oscillation of exchange coupling between magnetic layers @xcite and",
    "the appearance of giant magnetoresistance @xcite are among the exciting features of the magnetic multilayers , e.g. the layered fe / cr structures . an intense theoretical attempt has been made to understand the magnetic behavior of such systems @xcite . in these pioneering works in this field a simple generalization of the one dimensional hubbard model was proposed to investigate the role of electronic correlation in one dimensional superlattices .",
    "this model consists of a periodic arrangement of @xmath0 sites in which the on - site coulomb correlation @xmath1 is repulsive followed by @xmath2 sites with no on - site interaction @xmath3 .",
    "it was found that such a model gives rise to some interesting features , in sharp contrast with the magnetic behavior observed in an otherwise homogeneous system ( conventional one band hubbard model ) @xcite .    however , most of the previous works in this model employed exact diagonalization of finite systems typically having @xmath4 sites @xcite .",
    "some of these works reveal preferential distribution of local moments on sublattices and observe the suppression of spin density wave ( sdw ) order @xcite .",
    "some others deal with problems like metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite or formation of charge density wave @xcite in such systems .",
    "density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations are also performed to overcome limitations on system size imposed by the technique of exact diagonalization ; and , these consider system sizes @xmath5 @xcite . very recently a generalization of the said model has been considered where , instead of two types of sites with on - site correlation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , one takes into account two different values of @xmath8 at adjacent sites @xcite ; however , a detailed study of this generalized model is yet to be worked out . in view of the wider applicability of this model to diverse experimental systems ,",
    "we consider here a preliminary study of this alternating hubbard model ( ahm ) in one dimension",
    ". also we aim at observing the behavior of the same when the system size is reasonably large .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the ground state properties of the ahm in one dimension and for a half - filled band by using a hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) together with a real space renormalization group ( rg ) calculation .",
    "these two techniques , complemented by one another , was found to be very successful in studying similar cases in recent past @xcite .",

    "our model is defined on a one dimensional hubbard chain of @xmath9 ( even integer ) sites consisting of two sublattices .",
    "the model hamiltonian is , @xmath10    the two sublattices constructed out of odd and even numbered sites are labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",

    "we decouple the hamiltonian within the hfa , which is expected to work at least in the weak coupling regime .",
    "we define two parameters , number of electron @xmath21 and the magnetization @xmath22 at the @xmath15-th site , where , @xmath23 these lead to a decoupled hamiltonian : @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{u_{b}}{2}\\sum_{i\\in { \\cal b}}[(n_{i}+m_{i})n_{i,\\downarrow}+(n_{i}-m_{i})n_{i,\\uparrow})]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}(u_{a}+u_{b})(n_{i}^{2}-m_{i}^{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now the hamiltonian can be divided into two parts for two types of spins , i.e.  @xmath25 . in an unrestricted hfa one",

    "the ground state can be constructed by filling up the energy levels from both the up and the down bands upto the fermi level .",
    "one can define the spin and the charge density order parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , by @xmath30 we consider a half - filled chain with periodic boundary condition .",
    "one can easily check by using an unrestricted hfa calculation that all sites corresponding to a given sublattice become equivalent under a periodic boundary condition .",
    "this leads to a simplification of the formulas for @xmath28 and @xmath29 given above .",
    "we , therefore , use these simplified forms of the charge density order parameter @xmath28 and the spin density order parameter or antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath29 as given by , @xmath31    it is to be noted here that @xmath32 for a perfect `` chess - board''-type cdw and @xmath33 for a perfect nel - type antiferromagnetic sdw state .",

    "the transition occurs at the point of homogeneity , i.e. at @xmath47 . in this case , however , a further increase in @xmath34 suppresses the spin order again , and the cdw sets in .",
    "therefore , the sdw is found to form only at a singular point @xmath48 which is in agreement with the known result for the `` homogeneous '' limit @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes different for larger values of @xmath40 . for an intermediate value of @xmath49 ,",
    "we find two transitions : one from a cdw to an sdw and then from the sdw to a cdw again ; this can be identified by two successive cross - overs in the @xmath28- and the @xmath29-curves ( fig.1b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the charge order vanishes only at the point of homogeneity . for large @xmath50",
    "there appears only one transition from a cdw state to an sdw state at a specific value of @xmath51 . here",
    "also , the charge order parameter vanishes at @xmath52 , and then rises slowly with @xmath53 .",
    "however , in this region , the spin order parameter always dominates over the charge order parameter ( fig.1c ) .",
    "the phase transitions occurring at points of cross - overs of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can further be explored by studying the gap in the spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "the energy gap @xmath54 at the fermi level of a system containing @xmath55 electrons can be estimated from @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is the ground state energy of ( 3 ) for a system of @xmath55 particles . in fig.2",
    "we plot the energy gap @xmath54 as a function of @xmath34 for different fixed values of @xmath40 at half - filling .",

    "it is to be noted here that for large values of @xmath40 the energy gap sharply increases after the cdw / sdw transition has occurred ( fig.2 ) . in this regime the slow increase of the charge order parameter does not modify this behavior .    , as found from hfa , as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath58 .",
    "we have used the dotted line for @xmath59 , the solid line for @xmath60 , and the dashed line for @xmath61 ( scale of energy is chosen by setting @xmath38 ) . note that the zeroes in the gap match with the transition points identified from fig . 1 . ]",
    "identification of the points of phase transitions by the methods mentioned above enables us to draw the phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) on the @xmath62 plane within the hfa .    , and the solid line for @xmath63 ) in the @xmath62 plane .",
    "the plot is symmetrical about the `` line of homogeneity '' @xmath48 which is shown by the dotted line . ]    in fig.3 we plot the phase diagrams for different @xmath9 values to note the quick convergence of the present mean field results with system size . for small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase actually occurs along the line of `` homogeneity '' ( @xmath64 ) . for higher values of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "we obtain a centrally located broad sdw region together with two charge ordered phases located near the axes .",
    "the phase diagram turns out to be perfectly symmetric about the line of homogeneity along which the system is already known to be antiferromagnetic from exact calculations @xcite . in the limit @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) the cdw / sdw transition line above ( below ) the line of homogeneity bends towards the @xmath34 ( @xmath40 ) axis .",
    "next we apply a real space renormalization group ( rg ) technique @xcite to the same model keeping in view the success of this technique to similar 1-d systems of correlated electrons @xcite in recent past .",
    "it is to be noted here that in order to achieve a closed parameter space under the present scheme of rg iteration , we must generalize the model ( 1 ) as follows : @xmath67 where , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) refers to the site energy of a site belonging to the @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) sublattice .",

    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the total number of electrons , the total spin , and the @xmath83-component of the total spin respectively .",
    "these four states in a cell can now be identified as the ` renormalized ' on - site states @xmath84 ,  @xmath85 ,  @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .    to find the renormalized hopping matrix element , the matrix elements of @xmath88 and @xmath89 between ` renormalized on - site states ' are calculated , where @xmath90 is the annihilation operator of the electron with spin @xmath14 at the boundary site of the cell and @xmath73 or @xmath74 in the parenthesis denotes the type of the cell .",
    "let for an @xmath75 type cell @xmath91    and for a @xmath76 type cell @xmath92    our system possesses spin reversal symmetry , so the matrix elements for @xmath93 s will be as same as that of @xmath94 s ( except for a fermionic sign change in the value of @xmath95 ) .",
    "but due to the lack of particle - hole symmetry , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",

    "however , in implementing the recursion relation it is to be noted that a recursion for @xmath110 at a @xmath74 type site ( being at the middle of an @xmath75 cell ) will involve @xmath118 and @xmath119 pertaining to a renormalized @xmath73 type site , because under the rg transformation the @xmath75 cell @xmath120 a ` renormalized ' @xmath73 site .",

    "recursion relations are very much similar to that for @xmath110 .",
    "we construct the phase diagram primarily by studying the rg flow pattern .",

    "the `` line of homogeneity '' is shown by the dotted line . ]    therefore , the phase diagram obtained in the rg calculation agrees fairly well with that obtained in the hfa calculation ( fig .",
    "departures are appreciable only at the strong coupling limit ; it can be easily understood because in this limit the error due to the truncation of basis becomes most serious in the present rg scheme for a model having two types of cells @xcite .",
    "the energy scales used for truncation of basis in the two types of cells now become appreciably different ; the rg result , therefore , may not be highly reliable in this sector .",

    "8 we plot the local moments at two types of sites as functions of @xmath34 for different values of @xmath40 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath110 is always higher at sites with larger values of coulomb correlation .",
    "this is in agreement with a previous observation in @xcite .",
    "@xmath110 at @xmath73 type site equals that at @xmath74 type site only at the point of homogeneity i.e. at @xmath143 .",
    "it is rather interesting to note that the values of @xmath110 is slightly larger than @xmath144 even in the parameter space where , according to the rg flow pattern ( and also from the hfa ) , the system develops a cdw instability .",
    "this shows that this correlation - driven cdw phase is dominated by short length - scale fluctuations that are suppressed in a cdw phase generated by a periodic modulation in the site potentials alone @xcite .",
    "@xmath145 for ( a ) nn correlation , and ( b ) nnn correlation .",

    "we also calculate the nn and nnn spin - spin correlation functions with reference to @xmath75 and @xmath76 type cells . plotted as functions of @xmath34 these ( fig .",
    "9 ) reveal some interesting points .",
    "the negative value of @xmath146 indicates a nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic alignment , which is increasing from the cdw to the sdw regime , as one should expect on physical grounds . that this correlation is not zero even within the cdw phase is really a reflection of the short - range fluctuations that we have just mentioned .",
    "however , the nn correlation has slightly different values in @xmath75 and @xmath76 cells .",
    "this difference , which is much more pronounced at higher values of @xmath147 , is possibly related to the finite size effect of the rg .",
    "this effect is suppressed at weak coupling and near the `` homogeneous '' point in the sdw region . on the other hand",
    ", the nnn correlation has opposite signs for the @xmath75 and the @xmath76 type cells in a region corresponding to the charge density instability .",
    "this indicates a frustration that suppresses the large distance antiferromagnetic correlation .",
    "this frustration persists even within the sdw phase as it is evident from the widely different values of the nnn correlation in @xmath75 and @xmath76 type cells .",
    "such an effect has already been anticipated in a previous work @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted here that this effect gradually reduces as @xmath148 . in this respect",
    "the `` sdw phase '' of the half - filled ahm is behaving in a different way than the sdw instability found in a half - filled hubbard model ( the `` homogeneous limit '' of the present model ( 1 ) ) .",
    "now we study the nature of the ground state of the superlattice structure in presence of a magnetic field . the magnetic field penetrating",
    "the ring will interact with the moments of the electrons .",
    "there will be an additive zeeman term of the form @xmath149 in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , where @xmath150 is the moment of the spin @xmath14 and @xmath151 is the penetrating magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian now becomes @xmath152    we follow the same hfa to decouple the hamiltonian .",
    "since we have found regions of the parameter space where the hfa results and the rg results match very well , we can rely on the hfa results in these regions .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the up ( down ) spin electrons will generate the up ( down ) spin band .",
    "these two bands are not degenerate because the spin reversal symmetry is now broken .",
    "therefore , at half - filling , the number of up and down spin electrons will be different and a net moment will be generated .    for non - zero values of @xmath153 ) and @xmath154 , the system is charge ordered at half filling in absence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is an insulating phase with a gap between the upper and lower bands ; at half filling the lower bands for both spin species are totally filled .",
    "when a small magnetic field is turned on , the up and the down spin bands shift in the opposite directions in energy scale . at a sufficiently large value of the magnetic field the upper band of the up spin electrons tend to get occupied at the cost of depopulating the lower band of the down spin electrons .",
    "thus the ground state contains unequal number of up and down spins and the system , now having two partially filled bands , becomes conducting .",
    "if we go on increasing the magnetic field beyond a certain value , the said up spin band will be completely filled while the down spin band will be completely empty .",
    "the system is now spin polarized , leading again to an insulating phase .",
    "this can be easily checked by calculating the drude weight @xcite which measures the dc conductivity of the chain .",
    "similar analysis can be made for @xmath155 as well .",
    "of course , in this case there arises a possibility of transition to a conducting phase from an sdw under the application of the field @xmath151 .",
    "we have calculated the drude weight both for @xmath156 and @xmath157 . to calculate the drude weight ,",
    "a vanishingly small magnetic flux @xmath158 ( in units of flux quantum @xmath159 ) is introduced .",

    "13 ) of the ahm in presence of a zeeman field which shows the possibility of having an enhanced magnetoconductance for moderate values of the repulsive interactions . in case of very large coulomb interaction , however , no conducting phase appears , and a direct transition from an insulating sdw phase to a spin polarized phase is observed .",
    "summarizing , we have investigated the one dimensional half - filled alternating hubbard super lattice structure at zero temperature using the hartree - fock approximation and a real space renormalization group technique .",
    "although both the methods are approximate ones , they are complementary to one other .",
    "the agreement between the phase diagrams obtained from these two different methods shows that the results are rather reliable .",
    "we obtained two types of phases , dominated by charge and spin density wave instabilities respectively , depending on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 values .",
    "the @xmath189 phase diagram shows two transition lines , indicating a centrally located antiferromagnetic region and two charge density wave regions near the axes .",
    "the system is insulating .",
    "it may be noted at this point that the possibility of such transitions was not explored in the previous works on this model ; most of these works concentrated only on a limited region of the parameter space , e.g. @xmath190 and @xmath156 , and also there were some severe restrictions on the system size .",
    "apart from the phase transitions , it is interesting to note that there appears a spatial modulation of the local moments dictated by the inhomogeneity of the correlation parameters .",
    "the rg results also indicate that the ordering is not full grown as compared to the homogeneous limit because of underlying frustration of spin - spin correlation .",
    "these results are in agreement with a previous finding @xcite .",
    "also we have studied the ground state properties , including the drude weight , of the superlattice in presence of a magnetic field @xmath191 . the @xmath192 ( for fixed @xmath142 ) phase diagram shows that the system becomes conducting for an intermediate range of values of @xmath151 . in the phase diagram",
    ", we obtained insulating phases for lower and higher values of @xmath151 .",
    "the width of the conducting region depends on the values of on - site coulomb repulsion energies of the super lattice structure .",
    "it seems interesting to explore this model further , especially at finite temperatures and for cases away from half - filling . also the effect of varying `` spacer thickness '' @xcite for this regime of correlation parameters may yield some interesting observations ."
