    "at the classical level , if the strength of the field tends to infinity as @xmath5 approaches the boundary @xmath6 , we expect that the charged particle is confined and never visits the boundary : the hamiltonian dynamics is complete . at the quantum level",
    "the fact that the particle never feels the boundary amounts to saying that the magnetic field completely determines the motion , so there is no need for boundary conditions . at the mathematical level ,",
    "the problem is to find conditions on the behaviour of @xmath7 as @xmath5 tends to @xmath6 which ensure that the magnetic operator @xmath8 is essentially self - adjoint ( see section [ sec : ess - self ] ) on @xmath9 ( the space of compactly supported smooth functions ) .",

    "concerning the magnetic potential , the first general result is by ikebe and kato : in @xcite , they prove self - adjointness in the case of @xmath13 for any regular enough magnetic potential . this result was then improved in @xcite . concerning domains with boundary",
    ", we have not seen results in the purely magnetic case .",
    "a regularity condition on the direction of the magnetic field was introduced in the important paper @xcite ( corollary 2.10 p. 853 ) in order to construct `` magnetic bottles '' in @xmath12 .",

    "as we will see , in the case of a magnetic potential the agmon - type estimates still hold , whereas the hardy inequalities can not be used because there is no separation between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "actually the point is that we need , to apply the strategy of @xcite , some lower bound on the magnetic quadratic form @xmath14 associated with the magnetic potential @xmath10 .",
    "our main result is as follows : under some continuity assumption on the direction of @xmath7 at the boundary , for any @xmath15 and @xmath16 , there exists a constant @xmath17 such that the quadratic form @xmath14 satisfies the quite optimal bound @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a suitable norm on the space of bi - linear antisymmetric forms on @xmath20 , called the _",

    "the following questions seem to be quite interesting :    * what are the properties of a _ classical _ charged particle in a confining magnetic box ?",
    "are almost all trajectories not hitting the boundary ? * what is the _ optimal _ constant @xmath31 in the estimates @xmath32 of our main result [ essd ] ?",
