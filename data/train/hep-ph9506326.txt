    "one of the most important problems after the higgs boson is discovered in the future will be to study its self - interaction .",
    "it is necessary to clarify the nature of the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry which provides nonzero masses of intermediate bosons and fermions . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "one scalar higgs doublet field is introduced , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the physical scalar boson ( the higgs boson , itself ) and the @xmath7 s are unphysical goldstone fields corresponding to pure gauge degrees of freedom . the higgs potential is @xmath8 invariant , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the electric charge , @xmath11 the mass of @xmath12 boson and @xmath13 the weinberg mixing angle .",
    "the value of the vacuum expectation , @xmath14 gev , is fixed by the parameters of the intermediate bosons obtained from the experiments .",
    "the coupling constant ( @xmath15 ) is a free parameter in sm and is associated with the higgs mass , @xmath16 the experimental bound on the higgs mass is now @xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "the region @xmath18 gev ( _ light _ higgs ) will be explored by lep200 experiments while the mass range up to 400 gev ( _ intermediate _ higgs , @xmath19 , and heavier ) can be scanned at future linear colliders with @xmath20 gev ( discussed intensively these days @xcite ) .    in susy extensions of sm ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) several scalar particles",
    "are predicted to have the lightest mass , less than 200 gev .",
    "the hypothesis of grand unification theories also requires such light higgs boson in order to provide the experimental value of @xmath21 .",
    "experiments at lep200 and future linear colliders will crucially expose these intriguing theoretical constructions .",
    "hence , in the situation where only one scalar boson is discovered , a search for evidence of a nonminimal higgs self - interaction becomes an actual problem .",
    "such evidence could be deviations of @xmath4 and @xmath22 couplings from their sm values and contributions of higher order vertices ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "unfortunately , direct experimental probing of the vertices of @xmath22 and higher order is impossible , even at the presently discussed colliders , because of cross sections that are too small .",
    "a measurement of the triple higgs coupling is thus the only possibility to confirm the sm structure and to select new theories .",
    "the @xmath4 vertex also contributes to single @xmath6 production , which is discussed as discovery reactions .",
    "however , in these processes the interaction contains _ higgs - light fermion _ vertex , which has negligibly small coupling constant .",
    "so the @xmath4 vertex contribution to these reactions is very small .",
    "furthermore , single @xmath6 production reactions of higher orders ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) have very small cross sections . as a result , _ the processes of order @xmath27 and @xmath28 with double higgs production _ are practically the only way to investigate a higgs self - interaction .    for this purpose ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 colliders ( _ photon linear colliders  _ plc ) , which are based on the idea of compton backscattering of laser photons against the electron beam @xcite , are useful tools as well as @xmath0 colliders are .",
    "the energy distribution of the backscattered photons generally has a wide spectrum . if it is possible , however , to shift the interaction point far enough from the conversion point",
    ", the low - energy photons will exit the interaction area due to relatively large escape angles .",
    "the photon beam can be made practically monochromatic ( peaked at a point close to the energy of a basic electron beam , @xmath31 ) in this way .",
    "moreover , when the polarization of laser photons and that of electrons are opposite , the spectrum of backscattered photons will be most monochromatic .",
    "our analysis is based on the cross sections for a monochromatic beam .",
    "it is expected that the luminosity of plc could be on the same order as that for an @xmath0 collider @xcite , which is expected to be up to @xmath32 .",
    "we also estimate decreasing cross sections resulting from a convolution with the whole energy spectrum of the backscattered photon ( we used formulas given in @xcite ) .",
    "electron beams can be highly polarized at future linear colliders @xcite .",
    "a polarized positron beam has also been proposed @xcite , though there are still technical difficulties .",
    "since the polarized positron beam is important , anyway , we also mention the polarization of the positron beam",
    ". a high rate of circular polarization of photon beams will also be available . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes ,",
    "the total cross sections crucially depend on electron and positron chirality .",
    "the effective luminosity can be enhanced by using polarized beams .",
    "this enhancement could be important because much higher statistics are needed for some physically interesting processes , such as the double higgs production . keeping this circumstance in mind",
    ", we note that in @xmath33 processes , which we consider here , there is no significant dependence on the polarization of photons .",
    "however , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes , the cross sections in the case of polarized electrons gives just twice ( or more when the positron beam is also polarized ) that of the unpolarized one .",
    "we then basically estimate unpolarized results , and some comments about a polarization dependence of the cross sections are given , if necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ anomalh ]",
    "parametrization of an anomalous higgs potential is introduced . in section [ hh - prod ]",
    "we present numerical results for processes and some comments on signals produced along with double higgs production .",
    "those in @xmath0 collisions have been analyzed in @xcite-@xcite . in the present work we confirm their numerical results in @xmath0 collisions ( sec.[ee - hh ] ) and give new results for @xmath1 ( sec.[ea - hh ] ) and @xmath2 ( sec.[aa - hh ] ) collisions .",
    "we pay special attention to the case @xmath34 , including a background analysis concerning the discussed processes in section [ mh - mz ] .",
    "in section [ delta - analysis ] we give an analysis of the dependence of the cross sections on anomalous @xmath4 coupling for considered processes in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions .",
    "to estimate the contribution of the triple higgs vertex we have to change the corresponding constant @xmath15 in the higgs potential ( [ eq : v2h ] ) while keeping the @xmath8 invariance as well as the value of the vacuum expectation .",
    "we thus add to the sm potential the following monomials",
    "@xcite : @xmath35 although many new vertices will appear , for those processes of order @xmath27 and @xmath28 only some of them can contribute .",
    "they are @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 .    in the unitary gauge , where @xmath39 , this new potential changes only two sm vertices , @xmath4 and @xmath22 , and results in new free parameters , @xmath40 .",
    "in other gauges , for example in renormalizable covariant gauges , all vertices ( [ eq:3h34],[eq:4h34 ] ) can contribute , again with two free parameters .",
    "note that the constant at the @xmath22 vertex stays a free parameter for @xmath41 and @xmath42 processes .",
    "unfortunately @xmath43 is out of the experimental study due to small cross sections for possible processes and only @xmath44 coupling can be seen .",
    "we now introduce the following dimensionless parameter : @xmath45 the value @xmath46 corresponds to the vanishing @xmath4 vertex .",
    "it is clear that the cross sections are of quadratic form in @xmath47 , @xmath48 here , @xmath49 corresponds to the minimum of this function . to determine the function @xmath50 we calculate three points at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 implies sm .",
    "since the cross section is a quadratic function of @xmath47 , any analysis to derive an anomalous coupling would be slightly complicated .",
    "we now consider a statistical analysis when the experiment does not show any deviation from sm at the 95% cl for @xmath4 coupling .",
    "this means that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of detected events and @xmath55 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "two variants are possible :    0.2 cm @xmath56 if @xmath57 , then @xmath58    0.2 cm @xmath59 if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 here , @xmath62 variant @xmath56 implies that two values of @xmath47 correspond to the measured cross section ( within experimental errors ) . furthermore , these two values are separated by fixed interval which does not depend on the experimental errors .",
    "this discrete uncertainty takes place even if the number of measured events is sufficient to the level predicted by sm ",
    "some _ shadow _ interval will show up",
    "! when the luminosity is small , variant @xmath59 is realised . however , with increasing the integrated luminosity a discrete uncertainty appears at some critical integrated luminosity .",
    "it depends on only the higgs mass , and equals @xmath63    to characterize the dependence on @xmath47 we use two parameters which we denote as @xmath64 . in case",
    "@xmath59 these parameters are the corresponding bounds in ( [ eq : bbounds ] ) . in case",
    "@xmath56 they are the bounds of either of the intervals in ( [ eq : abounds ] ) that includes the sm point @xmath52 .",
    "we can not expect that the statistics for double higgs - production reactions could be high . in some cases",
    ", therefore , when the number of events is around seven or less , the distribution of the event probability will be poisson rather than gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , for definiteness we use the formulas given above .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for some processes with double higgs production .",
    "we carried out the calculations using the framework of the standard model .",
    "we used comphep @xcite and grace @xcite ( see also @xcite ) packages for independent calculations of the matrix elements and cross sections .",
    "these packages provide automatic computation of the cross sections and distributions in the standard model as well as its extensions at the tree level .",
    "all processes were estimated , including a complete set of diagrams .",
    "the calculations were made with 1% accuracy , and both packages gave consistent results .",
    "numerical results were obtained with the following values of physical constants : @xmath65 , @xmath66 gev , @xmath67 .",
    "the values of total cross sections are collected in the table [ tab : cs - ksi ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot - s ] we show the energy dependence of the total cross sections and in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot - mh ] the corresponding higgs mass dependence .",

    "this process has been investigated in @xcite ; we also confirmed their numerical results . here , higgs bosons are produced via bremsstrahlung from the @xmath69 boson ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zhh - diagr ] ) .",
    "the cross section decreases with energy far enough from the threshold . at some energy",
    "the total cross section has its maximum value of @xmath70 , depending on the higgs mass .",
    "higgs and @xmath69 bosons escape at large angles and with practically the same distributions .",
    "[ fig : ee - angle ] gives angular distribution for the higgs boson .",
    "since fermion chirality is conserved at the _ z - fermion _ vertex , the rate of this reaction may increase by practically twice when electrons and positrons are polarized .    for this reaction",
    "there is no competitive background .",
    "a light higgs boson decays to a @xmath71-pair ( more than 90% ) and other fermion pairs . for @xmath72",
    "gev the higgs boson decays mainly into @xmath73 or @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    "gev the main branchings are @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for heavier higgs bosons . in these cases suitable cuts on the invariant masses",
    "should be introduced around those points corresponding to @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath11 .",
    "we can say that for light higgs the observation of more than 5 events per year is plausible at a 500-gev @xmath0 collider with @xmath80/_year_. the initial state radiation would reduce 7% of the total cross section . to study a heavier higgs boson ,",

    "the possible background could be the reaction @xmath87 , which proceeds at the one - loop level .",
    "it seems , however , that its cross section is very small . in @xcite",
    "it is estimated to be less than @xmath88 fb at @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 gev , and with visible decreasing at high @xmath91 .",
    "since only a left - handed electron and a right - handed positron contribute in this reaction , if the electron beam ( both electron and positron beams ) would be polarized , the statistics would be increased by twice ( four times , respectively ) . for unpolarized experiments",
