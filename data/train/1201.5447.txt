    "geometry of various special configurations of robot arms modeled by open polygonal chains appears essential in many problems of mechanics , robot engineering and control theory .",
    "the present paper is concerned with certain planar configurations of robot arms appearing as critical points of the oriented area considered as a function on the moduli space of the arm in question .",
    "this setting naturally arose in the framework of a general approach to extremal problems on configuration spaces of mechanical linkages developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which has led to a number of new results on the geometry of cyclic polygons @xcite , @xcite and suggested a variety of open problems .",
    "the approach and results of @xcite , @xcite provided a paradigm and basis for the developments presented in this paper .",
    "let us now outline the structure and main results of the paper .",
    "we begin with recalling necessary definitions and basic results concerned with moduli spaces and cyclic configurations . in the second section",
    "we prove that critical configurations of a planar robot arm are given by the cyclic configurations with diametrical endpoints called diacyclic ( theorem 1 ) and describe the structure of all cyclic configurations of a robot arm ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "next , we establish that , for a generic collection of lengths of the links , the oriented area is a morse function on the moduli space ( theorem 3 ) and provide some explications in the case of a 3-arm . in the last section we prove an explicit formula for the morse index of a diacyclic configuration ( theorem 6 ) and illustrate it by a few visual examples . in conclusion",
    "we briefly discuss several open problems and related topics .",

    "let @xmath1 . informally , a _ robot arm _ , or an _ open polygonal chain _ is defined as a linkage built up from rigid bars ( edges ) of lengths @xmath2 consecutively joined at the vertices by revolving joints .",
    "it lies in the plane , its vertices may move , and the edges may freely rotate around endpoints and intersect each other .",
    "this makes various planar configurations of the robot arm .",
    "let us make this precise .",
    "a _ configuration _ of a robot arm is defined as a @xmath3-tuple of points @xmath4 in the euclidean plane @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "each configuration carries a natural orientation given by vertices order .    to factor out the action of orientation - preserving isometries of the plane @xmath5",
    ", we consider only configurations with two first vertices fixed : @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the set of all such planar configurations of a robot arm is called the _ moduli space _ of a robot arm .",
    "we denote it by @xmath9 .",
    "it is a subset of euclidean space @xmath10 and inherits its topology and a differentiable space structure so that one can speak of smooth mappings and diffeomorphisms in this context .",
    "after these preparations it is obvious that the moduli space of any planar robot arm is diffeomorphic to the torus @xmath11 .",
    "we will use its parametrization by angle - coordinates @xmath12 ( that is , by angles between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the oriented ( signed ) area as a function on @xmath15 .    for any configuration @xmath16 of @xmath17 with vertices @xmath18 , its _ ( doubled ) oriented area _",
    "a(r ) is defined by @xmath19    in other words , we add the connecting side @xmath20 turning a given configuration @xmath16 into a @xmath21-gon and compute the oriented area of the latter .",
    "obviously , @xmath22 is a smooth function on the moduli space @xmath15 of any robot arm @xmath17 .",
    "a configuration @xmath4 of a robot arm @xmath23 is _ cyclic _ if all its vertices lie on a circle .",
    "a configuration is _ quasicyclic _ ( a qc - configuration for short ) if all its vertices lie either on a circle or on a ( straight ) line .",
    "a configuration is _ closed cyclic _ if the last and the first vertices coincide : @xmath24 .    a configuration is _ diacyclic _ if it is cyclic and the `` connecting side '' @xmath25 is a diameter of the circumscribed circle ( `` diacyclic '' is a sort of shorthand for `` diametrally cyclic '' ) . in other words ,",
    "the connecting side @xmath20 passes through the center of the circumscribed circle or , equivalently , each interval @xmath26 is orthogonal to the interval @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "[ thm_crirical ] for any robot arm @xmath29 , critical points of @xmath30 on the moduli space @xmath15 are exactly the diacyclic configurations of @xmath17 .",
    "as above , we assume that @xmath31 ,  @xmath32 . for a configuration @xmath33 we put @xmath34 .",
    "obviously , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "denote by @xmath37 the oriented area of the parallelogram spanned by vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( i.e. , we take the third coordinate of their vector product ) .",
    "the differentiation of vectors @xmath40 with respect to angular coordinates @xmath41 will be denoted by upper dots ( i.e. , there will appear terms of the form @xmath42 ) . with these assumptions and notations",
    "we can write @xmath43 taking partial derivatives with respect to @xmath44 we get @xmath45 notice now the identities : @xmath46 eventually we get : @xmath47 consider now the equations @xmath48 defining the critical set of a. by taking appropriate linear combinations of equations , this system of @xmath49 equations is easily seen to be equivalent to the system of equations : @xmath50 in geometric terms this means that the intervals @xmath51 and @xmath52 are orthogonal for @xmath53 .",
    "it remains to refer to thales theorem to conclude that the points @xmath54 lie on a circle with diameter @xmath55 .",
    "the order of the lengths @xmath56 does not matter : for any transposition @xmath57 , there exists a diffeomorphism taking @xmath15 to @xmath58 which preserves the function @xmath30 , and therefore , all the critical points together with their morse indices .",
    "the proof ( which repeats the proof of the similar lemma for closed polygons from @xcite ) is as follows .",
    "two consecutive edges of a configuration can be ( geometrically ) permuted in such a way that the oriented area remains unchanged . such a geometrical permutation yields a diffeomorphism from one configuration space to another .    [ thm_qasicyclic ]",
    "assume that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "then we have the following :    1 .",
    "the set of all quasicyclic configurations is a disjoint collection of @xmath61 embedded ( topological ) circles ( qc - components for short ) .",
    "2 .   each of the circles contains at least two critical points of @xmath30 .",
    "assuming that all critical points are morse non - degenerate , @xmath30 is a perfect morse function if and only if each circle has exactly two critical points of @xmath30 .",
    "each of the circles contain exactly two aligned configurations .",
    "we shall use the following notation : for a quasicyclic configuration , we define @xmath62 if the center of the circle lies to the left with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "otherwise we put @xmath64 .",
    "we show that each collection of signs @xmath65 yields a ( topological ) circle of quasicyclic configurations .",
    "indeed , fix @xmath66 .",
    "take a ( metric ) circle @xmath67 whose radius @xmath68 varies from @xmath69 to infinity .",
    "a differentiable coordinate for a qc - component is e.g. the angle between the first and the second arm ( mod @xmath70 ) .",
    "the change of this angle induces a differentiable change of the radius @xmath68 and each vertex moves around the intersection of a circle with center @xmath71 and radius @xmath2 , which intersects the circumscribed circle ( with radius @xmath68 ) transversal ( due to the condition @xmath72 ) .",
    "if @xmath73 , the circle @xmath67 has exactly one ( up to a rigid motion ) inscribed configuration with @xmath74 and exactly one inscribed configuration with @xmath75 .",
    "the qc - component becomes in this way divided into four arcs , each with prescribed type of @xmath76 , parameterized by the radius @xmath68 . at the endpoints ( that is , if @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) the four arcs join .",
    "more precisely , the arc that corresponds to @xmath79 is followed by the arc that corresponds to @xmath80 , then the next one with @xmath81 , then to the one with @xmath82 , and then to @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ quasicyclic ] ) .",
    "continuity reasons imply that each such a circle of quasicyclic configurations has at least two diacyclic ones .",
    "the condition @xmath59 is important indeed : if there are several longest edges , the qc - components acquire common points . for instance , for an equilateral arm , they form a connected set",
    ".    a qc - component can contain besides the diacyclic and aligned arms also closed cyclic arms ( polygons ) .",
    "all of them occur in this way .",
    "these special configurations are related to critical points of functions on configuration spaces ( respectively , oriented area of an arm , squared length of the closing interval ( see @xcite , and oriented area of a polygon ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that existence of a closed polygon on a qc - component ( as well as the number of diacyclic configurations ) depends on @xmath56 .        for a generic sidelength vector @xmath83",
    ", the function @xmath30 has only non - degenerate critical points on @xmath15 .",
    "the proof from @xcite is applicable with some evident modifications .",
    "namely , after introducing a local coordinate system with diagonals as coordinates , the hessian matrix becomes tridiagonal with analytic entries .",
    "deformation arguments show that a perturbation of just two of the edgelengths @xmath2 makes the hessian non - zero .    for a @xmath84-arm we obviously have two points : one maximum and one minimum .",
    "generically , for a 3-arm @xmath30 has exactly @xmath85 critical points on @xmath86 . if @xmath30 is a morse function ( that is , if the hessian is non - degenerate ) , these are two extrema and two saddles ( see fig . [ fig_openarm ] ) .",

    "this can be done as follows .",
    "one uses elementary geometry to obtain a cubic equation for the length @xmath89 of the connecting edge : @xmath90    one has to solve these equations in @xmath89 , taking into account @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "elementary calculation shows that both the + equation and the - equation have one solution satisfying these conditions .",
    "from @xmath93 it follows that there are exactly two solutions in each case .",
    "they occur in pairs @xmath94 , which gives the result .",
    "notice that this reasoning shows in all cases , ( except for @xmath95 ) that there are four critical points ; in the generic case they are all morse .",
    "if @xmath95 there are three critical points , one of which is a `` monkey saddle '' .",
    "note that in this case we obtain the minimal number of critical points of a differentiable function on a torus .",
    "it is equal to the lusternick - schnirelmann category of the torus , see @xcite .    in the case",
