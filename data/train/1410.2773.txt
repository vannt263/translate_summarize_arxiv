    "knowing the speed at which ions leave a plasma is important for accurate modeling of both plasma - material interactions and global plasma characteristics .",
    "this affects laboratory plasmas , particularly in the areas of diagnostics and materials processing  @xcite , as well as the interaction of space plasmas with spacecraft  @xcite .",
    "langmuir  @xcite and bohm  @xcite first predicted that ions leave a plasma supersonically when a single ion species is present : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron temperature and @xmath2 is the ion mass .",
    "this constraint is called the bohm criterion and it has long been agreed upon theoretically  @xcite , and confirmed experimentally @xcite , that the equality form is satisfied in quiescent weakly collisional plasmas",
    ". however , there is currently a lack of consensus between theory , experiments and simulations on how to determine the speed of each ion species if more than one is present  @xcite .",
    "this is a critical issue because plasmas often contain a mixture of ion species and the speed of each is desired as a boundary condition .",
    "the bohm criterion has been extended to include multiple ion species @xcite . for two ion species",
    "the result is @xmath3 where the indices 1 and 2 label the ion species and @xmath4 is a sound speed associated with species @xmath5 .",
    "we assume @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) . like the single species bohm criterion , equality is expected to hold in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) ( this has also been confirmed experimentally  @xcite ) .",
    "however , an additional constraint is required to determine both @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the sheath edge .",
    "if the two ion species are decoupled , the presheath electric field may be expected to impart the same energy to each .",
    "applying @xmath9 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) leads to the prediction that each species obtains its individual sound speed at the sheath edge ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "ion - neutral drag causes only slight deviations from this prediction in weakly collisional plasmas  @xcite . in the other limit ,",
    "complete coupling between the two ion species , such that @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) , predicts flow at a common system sound speed @xmath12 . although there was apparent theoretical consensus on the individual sound speed solution  @xcite , experiments in ar@xmath13-xe@xmath13 plasmas measured values closer to the system sound speed  @xcite .",
    "this merging of ion speeds suggests that ion - ion friction may be playing a role in the experiments , but standard coulomb collisions are far too weak to explain the measurements  @xcite .    a recent theory proposed that ion - ion two - stream instabilities in the presheath can cause an instability - enhanced friction ( ief ) force through wave - particle scattering  @xcite .",
    "this theory is consistent with the experimentally - observed flow coupling , and experimental evidence for ion - ion two - stream instabilities using probes has also been presented  @xcite .",
    "although experiments appeared to provide verification  @xcite , recent particle - in - cell / monte carlo collision ( pic - mcc ) simulations by gudmundsson and lieberman ( gl ) were shown to disagree with it  @xcite .",
    "these simulations found no evidence of the instabilities , or enhanced friction force , which challenged the theory and raised the question of why it agrees with the experiments but not the simulations .",
    "pic - mcc is a widely used simulation technique providing one of the most detailed descriptions of plasma kinetics , so resolving this discrepancy is a critical issue . here",
    ", we reconcile this apparent discrepancy .",
    "first , using exact numerical solutions of the linear dispersion relation , we show that there is a critical temperature ratio required for instability @xmath14 that was not considered previously .",
    "we show that while the temperature ratio from the gl simulation @xcite falls below this threshold , the exact theory still predicts instability for the parameters of the lhs experiment  @xcite .",
    "second , and more importantly , we conduct new pic - mcc simulations that confirm the presence of ion - ion two - stream instabilities near the sheath edge . we find that the ion - ion friction force is enhanced in this same region .",
    "furthermore , the simulated ion speeds agree well with the values predicted by the ief theory .",
    "two - stream instabilities arise when the differential ion flow speed exceeds a threshold condition : @xmath15 .. ] differential ion flow arises as the presheath electric field accelerates the lighter species to a faster speed ( e.g. , within the ballistic presheath model @xmath16 at the sheath edge ) .",
    "the ief force is predicted to prevent the differential flow from significantly exceeding the threshold condition ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath18 ions reach the sheath edge without exciting instabilities , so the traditional individual sound speed solution is expected to hold .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath19 has been proposed as a second constraint that along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) provides both @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "two analytic approximations have been provided for @xmath20 based on the value of the ion mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "these predict that there is a concentration dependence on the ion speeds , which has been tested experimentally  @xcite . here",
    "we go beyond these approximations to show that there is also a temperature ratio threshold for instability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : linear ] describes numerical solutions of the full kinetic linear dispersion relation for ion - ion two - stream instabilities .",
    "limitations of the previous analytic approximations are discussed .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on the instability thresholds in differential flow speed ( @xmath20 ) and temperature ratio @xmath21 .",
    "the latter condition was not considered in the previous approximate solutions .",
    "section  [ sec : pic ] describes the results of pic - mcc simulations of he - xe plasmas at different concentrations .",
    "this provides a number of original results : ( 1 ) the first identification of ion - ion two - stream instabilities in the presheath in a particle simulation , ( 2 ) the first identification of an enhancement of the ion - ion friction force directly correlated with these instabilities , and ( 3 ) the first simulation test of the ion flow speeds predicted by the ief theory in a situation where these instabilities are present .",
    "this section advances the previous analytic approximations for the instability threshold conditions  @xcite by treating numerical solutions of the full kinetic linear dispersion relation . to do so , we consider the standard linear dielectric response function for ion - frequency fluctuations in an unmagnetized plasma  @xcite @xmath22   \\label{eq : ephat}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the plasma dispersion function .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 has been defined by the substitution @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the complex angular wave frequency .",

    "the assumptions leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ephat ] ) are that ions have maxwellian distribution functions , unity charge , frequencies of interest satisfy @xmath31 , and that the gradient scale length of plasma parameters ( densities , temperatures and flow speeds ) are much longer than the wavelengths of interest .",
    "the latter holds because the debye - scale waves of interest are much shorter than the presheath .",
    "ion - neutral collisions are neglected .",
    "we also assume that the two ion species have the same temperature @xmath32 . and xe@xmath13 temperatures are typically within 10% of each other . ]",

    "one salient feature of the solutions is that the ar - xe growth rate becomes a purely damped solution below a modest electron temperature of approximately 0.5 ev .",
    "this indicates that there is a temperature ratio threshold that was not considered in @xcite .",

    "fluid treatments of the two - stream instability arise from a large argument expansion .",
    "the figures show that the arguments are not large in the ar - xe case , implying that a kinetic treatment is required .",
    "the arguments are large in the he - xe case , justifying a fluid expansion , except when the electron temperature drops too low .",
    "reference @xcite discusses the kinetic versus fluid aspect at length , where it is suggested that the magnitude of these arguments depends on the mass ratio of ion species . for disparate masses @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 )",
    "it was suggested that the normal fluid expansion should be accurate , providing an analytic approximation for @xmath20 . for similar masses",
    "@xmath36 it was suggested that a different ( order unity argument ) expansion of the @xmath26-functions was required , which led to a different analytic approximation for @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical analysis shown in figs .",
    "[ fg : growth_ar ] and [ fg : growth_he ] largely affirms this expectation .",
    "however , the previous approximations also assumed @xmath37 to be asymptotically large .",

    "we also tested these predictions against several new pic - mcc simulations under a variety of conditions and found good agreement with the theory .",

    "<S> the speed at which ions enter a sheath is a fundamental property of a plasma that also provides a useful boundary condition in modeling . a recent theory proposed that this can be significantly influenced by an instability - enhanced friction force arising from two - stream instabilities in the presheath when multiple ion species are present . </S>",
    "<S> although experiments appeared to confirm this theory , recent particle simulations have brought it into question . </S>",
    "<S> we reconcile this controversy using direct numerical solutions of the dispersion relation , which show that there is a dependence on the electron - ion temperature ratio that was not considered previously . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , particle - in - cell simulations are used to show that ion - ion two - stream instabilities can arise near the sheath edge and generate an enhanced ion - ion friction force . only by accounting for the instability - enhanced friction force can theory </S>",
