    "the photon - neutrino interaction is very feeble , involving only electrically neutral external particles .",
    "the cross sections are exceedingly tiny . therefore this interaction can only be of astrophysical interest .",

    "another possible application involves the propagation of light waves through a handed neutrino sea @xcite which results in optical activity ( birefringence ) .",
    "there may perhaps be effects in the cooling of the early universe .",
    "for all these reasons there has been some small theoretical interest in this interaction @xcite .",
    "we consider here the interaction at energies which are small compared to the mass of the weak bosons . at these energies",
    "the weak interaction can be described by a fermi type effective theory . to have @xmath2 interaction",
    "one needs virtual leptons which couple both weakly and electromagnetically , thus lepton loops in feynman graphs .",
    "contrary to intuition a two loop graph dominates the parity violation . in this section",
    "we summarize our results using only dimensional arguments .",
    "a more technical description is in the next sections .    for supernova cooling",
    "the amplitude for the annihilation @xmath1 is relevant , while for photon propagation in a neutrino sea the parity violation in the cross(scattering ) channel @xmath0 is important .",
    "we discuss first the annihilation process where the two loop contribution turns out to be small .",
    "it is natural to expect higher order graphs to be smaller but as mentioned we find a violation of this rule here .",
    "this is reminiscent of a surprise in coherent photon scattering from atoms discussed by g.e.brown and woodward and later peierls @xcite .",
    "the earliest estimate for the annihilation amplitude used the fermi theory of weak interactions @xcite , but gell - mann @xcite noted that in @xmath3 theory this amplitude vanishes for a point interaction of four fermions .",
    "this can be understood physically without any detailed computation . in fermi theory",
    "the annihilation amplitude is described by a triangle graph , with an electron running in the triangular loop ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "scattering in the four - fermion model.,width=188 ]    two of the vertices of the triangle are electromagnetic ( where the two photons couple ) and the third vertex is weak , where the two neutrinos emerge .",
    "the amplitude has magnitude @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the four - momenta of the neutrino and photon , and @xmath7 is the only non - vanishing relativistic invariant for the process ( the feynman amplitude is dimensionless which brings the factor @xmath7 ) . because the two neutrinos emerge from the same space - time point they can have no relative orbital angular momentum ( s - wave ) . with vector or axial vector coupling ( @xmath3 ) , the spins of the fermion - anti - fermion pair must be parallel .",
    "a theorem of landau and yang @xcite forbids two free photons in a state with total angular momentum one .",
    "so the process is forbidden at order @xmath8 in @xmath3 theory .",
    "gell - mann also noted that this proof does not hold if there is a weak boson mediating the weak interaction , so that the two neutrinos are emitted at separate space - time points .    with a weak boson to mediate the interaction ,",
    "the ( parity conserving ) amplitude was estimated by levine @xcite , and his estimate remains valid in the standard model , as noted by a number of authors @xcite.with the weak boson the loop changes from a triangle to a square , with the weak boson providing one of the sides ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "scattering in the standard model . ]    [ fig2 ]    this gives an additional factor of @xmath9 to first order in the momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this suppression factor vanishes when the boson mass goes to infinity , in agreement with gell - mann s theorem .",
    "the precise cross section for the annihilation was computed by dicus and repko @xcite to order @xmath10 :    @xmath11 [ \\omega^6/m^4_w][1-z^4 ] \\;\\ ; , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is @xmath13 and @xmath14 the photon energy(in com system : @xmath15 ) and we have dropped logarithms .",
    "this is in agreement with the one loop feynman amplitude described above , up to a constant factor : @xmath16[angular function][logarithms ] \\;\\;.",
    "\\label{2}\\ ] ] the suppression factor ( @xmath17 ) may be interpreted as a @xmath18 factor associated with a d - wave for the two neutrinos .",
    "therefore the leading order amplitude may be thought of as anomalously small compared to initial expectations @xcite .",
    "when we go to the next order in weak interactions there is a set of diagrams in which the two neutrinos are emitted at a separation of the order of the compton wavelength of the electron instead of the compton wavelength of the weak boson .",
    "the diagram remains a square with two adjacent weak ( order @xmath8 ) vertices , separated by an electron - neutrino loop .",
    "the two final neutrinos are emitted at the two weak vertices , and the two photons couple at the two remaining vertices ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "scattering , width=113 ]    we can estimate the feynman amplitude associated with the two - loop graph in lowest order using the same dimensional arguments as in the case of the one - loop result , changing the @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the denominator : @xmath21 = [ g^2_f\\alpha \\omega^   6/m^2_e][angular function ] \\;\\ ; \\label{3}\\ ] ] and therefore the ratio of the two - loop amplitude to the one loop is : @xmath22    the bracketed ratio of the two squared masses is very large @xmath23 so that the cross - section is dominated by the leading term @xmath24 only at low energies @xmath25 .",
    "however at intermediate photon energies @xmath26 our estimate of the two loop contribution is no longer valid since the ratio @xmath27 is no longer small . to estimate what happens at these energies",
    "we take the limit where this ratio is large and then we expect @xmath28 to be replaced by @xmath29",
    ". then the ratio of the two loop contribution to the one loop contribution becomes of order @xmath30 which is a small number ( of order @xmath31 ) independent of energy .",
    "therefore there is no enhancement of the annihilation amplitude due to two loop diagrams .",
    "this is in accord with expectations .",
    "we come now to the parity violating amplitude in the cross channel .",
    "this was first studied by royer @xcite , using the triangle graph , and his result criticized by stodolsky @xcite on the basis of gell - mann s theorem .",
    "more recently estimates have been proposed using the standard model @xcite and the one lepton loop graph , for both real and virtual photons . here",
    "we show that these one loop estimates are all negligible when compared to the two lepton loop estimate - for real photons .    in the cross channel",
    "the amplitude has to be odd under inversion of the coordinates .",
    "the precise form is discussed in section 2 , and given below . as a result",
    ", parity violation appears dimensionally as a two loop effect even for a one loop amplitude .",
    "so it is natural to consider two loop terms together with one loop terms .",
    "the estimate of the parity violating feynman amplitude in the standard model can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant involving logarithms @xcite and in the second line we evaluate the magnitude of the first expression in the forward direction for photons of energy @xmath14 where @xmath34 .",
    "this formula should apply for @xmath35 .",
    "with two lepton loops the corresponding parity violating feynman amplitude has the form(for @xmath36 ) @xmath37\\sim   0.025g^2_f\\alpha\\omega^6/m^2_e .",
    "; \\label{6}\\ ] ] if we compare the two lepton loop to the one lepton loop result we find @xmath38 . \\;\\ ; \\label{7}\\ ] ]    this ratio is quite large and independent of the photon energy below @xmath39 ; its value is approximately @xmath40 .",
    "physically this reflects the fact that the two final neutrinos are separated in the two loop feynman graph by an intermediate electron and a neutrino , and hence a distance of an electron compton wavelength . even for photon energies above @xmath41",
    "the corresponding graph with a muon loop enhances the amplitude for photon- muon - neutrino scattering by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "should such an effect be observed it would indicate a violation of @xmath43 and lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "attempts to observe such an effect have been unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "why is the situation different with the parity violation in the forward amplitude in the scattering channel ?",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "this amplitude must be odd under parity and therefore be at least cubic in @xmath44 .",
    "so we need an extra factor of @xmath44 and this comes ( in the one - loop case ) with its own denominator @xmath45 , for dimensional reasons .",
    "therefore the parity violating amplitude even in the one loop diagram is formally of order @xmath46 and therefore on par with the two loop diagram .",
    "however it should be emphasized that even with this large enhancement factor the effect remains extremely small .    for real photons",
    "@xmath47 , the two loop estimates are as explained above , dominant .",
    "therefore estimates of the rotatory power of the neutrino sea in the literature @xcite have to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath40 to make them right .",
    "in particular , using the equation ( 31 ) of abbasabadi and repko @xcite , and applying this correction we get for the rotatory power @xmath48 the formula :    @xmath49    which should only apply in the range discussed by abbasabadi and repko @xcite ( where @xmath50 is the neutrino fermi energy ) .    for off - mass - shell photons",
    "the situation is different , since the landau - yang theorem does not apply to off - mass shell photons .",
    "therefore even the lowest triangle graph is viable as was realized by nieves et al @xcite . at low photon energy",
    "their one loop estimate remains dominant while at higher photon energies the two loop estimate dominates .",
    "the transition between low and high photon energies @xmath51 , is given by the equation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the neutrino energy in the rest frame of the sea .",
    "for a standard sea of energy of a few degrees kelvin the transition occurs in the @xmath54region , but for an unconventional sea of fermi energy @xmath55 @xcite the two loop estimate will dominate even for visible photons . for radio waves the one loop estimate dominates for virtual photons .",
    "for a systematic study of neutrino - photon interaction it is useful to work with effective lagrangians .",
    "the simplest example of the effective lagrangian is the four - fermion interactions of neutrinos @xmath56 with electrons @xmath57 . for fermions with momenta much smaller than intermediate bosons mass",
    "one can integrate degrees of freedom associated with @xmath58 and @xmath59 and write the effective lagrangian only for fermionic degrees of freedom :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 . in the standard model ( @xmath62 ) one finds @xmath63 . for small momenta",
    "this effective lagrangian is as good as the fundamental lagrangian of the @xmath62 .",
    "consider now the process @xmath64 at momenta smaller than intermediate bosons mass or even smaller than the mass of electron @xmath20 .",
    "interaction between neutrino and photons occurs only through the interaction of photons with charged virtual particles in loops .",
    "loop diagrams are numerous and a bit complicated . for small momenta @xmath65",
    "one can expand @xmath66 amplitudes in the power series in this small parameter .",
    "the lowest terms of this expansion can be represented as a matrix element of the appropriate operators i.e. of the particular terms of the effective lagrangian .",
    "each term of the effective lagrangian has to be lorenz - invariant combination of gauge - invariant electromagnetic field tensor @xmath67 and left - handed neutrino field @xmath68 and their derivatives .",
    "effective lagrangian has dimension four : @xmath69\\sim{[m]^4}$ ] .",
    "the operators may have higher dimensions @xmath70 . to preserve correct dimension",
    "the coefficients in front of these operators should be proportional to appropriate power of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the scale of mass walking inside the loops .",
    "the actual calculation of the diagrams gives numerical coefficient in front of the operator .",
    "this line of reasoning is very similar to the naive dimensional arguments given in the introduction .",
    "the only advantage of effective lagrangian is that within that more advanced approach we get more clear understanding of the structure of the operators ( i.e. of the scattering amplitudes ) .",
    "consider effective lagrangian for @xmath73-even @xmath2-scattering .",
    "the photon s part of amplitude should be even under parity , i.e. be the same for right - handed photons and left - handed photons .",
    "one has to construct appropriate lorenz invariant operators from the fields @xmath67 and @xmath74 .",
    "the combination of the fields that satisfies all these conditions looks as follows :    @xmath75   \\bar{\\nu } \\gamma_{\\alpha}\\partial_{\\beta } ( 1 + \\gamma_5 ) \\nu + h.c . \\;\\ ; , \\label{10}\\ ] ]    it has dimension @xmath76 .",
    "matrix element of @xmath77 for forward scattering gives the amplitude    @xmath78    if we identify parameter @xmath72 in eq.(11 ) with the largest mass in diagrams ( i.e. with @xmath79 ) we reproduce well known result @xcite up to the numerical constant .    from this exercise",
    "it is absolutely clear that non - zero @xmath80 scattering appears only in the second order in photon momenta , i.e. in order @xmath81 .",
    "thus one immediately concludes that any results of zero order in @xmath6 , i.e. of order @xmath82 ( e.g. such as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are erroneous .    there is no way to violate gell - mann theorem within effective lagrangians . to get the amplitude of the order @xmath83 one needs operator with @xmath84 . by direct inspection",
    "one finds that there is no gauge invariant operator with @xmath84 .",
    "consider now two - loop amplitudes with light particles ( i.e. electrons and neutrino ) in intermediate state between two external neutrino vertices .",
    "we expect that these diagrams are proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "thus to preserve correct dimension in effective lagrangian we need operator of dimension @xmath86 .",
    "appropriate effective lagrangian is    @xmath87 [ \\bar{\\nu } \\gamma_{\\alpha}\\partial_{\\beta}\\partial_{\\gamma } ( 1 + \\gamma_5 ) \\nu ] + h.c . \\;\\ ;   \\label{12}\\ ] ]    for this @xmath77 the scattering amplitude is of the third order in @xmath88    @xmath89    thus for p - even scattering second order loops give correction of the order @xmath90 , i.e. small correction to the one - loop result .",
    "now let us come back to @xmath73-odd effects in @xmath2 scattering and find appropriate operators in @xmath91 responsible for optical activity .",

    "the reason for that discrepancy is unknown .",
    "though numerically eqs.(18 ) and ( 19 ) differ by only a few per cent it would be interesting to understand whether there is a correct one - loop calculation .        the optical activity for off - shell photon was first considered by mohanty , nieves and pal in @xcite .",
    "they noticed that gell - mann prohibition theorem does not work for the off - shell photons .",
