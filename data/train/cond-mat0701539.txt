    "random displacements resulting from particle encounters in suspension flows lead to hydrodynamically induced particle migration with respect to the local suspension velocity @xcite . for non - brownian particles under creeping - flow conditions ,",
    "hydrodynamically induced migration constitutes an important mechanism of particle redistribution in the suspending fluid .",
    "thus studies of particle encounters in flowing suspensions are vital both from the fundamental and practical points of view .    as shown by @xcite , two spheres passing each other in unbounded shear flow return to the initial transverse ( cross - streamline ) positions after a binary encounter is completed .",
    "this behavior follows from the flow reflection symmetry of stokes equations and a reflection symmetry of the system . since on open binary trajectories there are no cross - streamline particle displacements , for perfect spheres in free space the transverse hydrodynamic - diffusion process requires encounters of at least three particles [ see , eg . ]",

    "it follows that the self - diffusion coefficient scales as @xmath0 in the low - concentration regime , and the @xmath1 contribution associated with binary encounters arises only in the presence of non - hydrodynamic forces that remove the flow - reflection symmetry of the problem . for non - brownian particles non - hydrodynamic interactions",
    "often result from direct particle contacts due to surface roughness .",
    "several years ago @xcite measured the @xmath1 contribution to the shear - induced self - diffusivity @xmath2 for a dilute suspension of spheres undergoing shear flow in a couette device .",
    "the experiments yielded a surprising result : the self - diffusion coefficient was nearly an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical estimate @xcite for rough spheres with the roughness amplitude corresponding to the experimental system .",
    "several possible causes of the anomalous self - diffusivity ( such as inertial lift and non - newtonian effects ) were examined , but none of them was sufficient to explain the anomaly .",
    "the suspension in the couette device used in experiments of @xcite was bounded by nearly flat parallel walls separated by a relatively small distance @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the particle diameter ) . in the analysis of experimental results",
    "it was assumed that the effect of walls on the self - diffusivity coefficient must be negligible . since the fore - aft symmetry of the system would ensure that after passing each other the particles would return to their original streamlines ( as they do in infinite space ) , it seemed unlikely that the walls were the cause of the enhanced self - diffusivity .",
    "in the present paper we show that hydrodynamic interactions of particle pairs with the confining walls result in cross - streamline particle displacements in binary encounters in shear flow .",
    "specifically , we have found a new class of binary trajectories : the particles on such trajectories initially approach each other , but then they move across the channel in opposite directions and separate without passing each other ( unlike the particles in free space ) .    the new class of trajectories results from a sign change of the transverse component of the relative particle velocity .",
    "such sign changes in wall - bounded systems were first pointed out in our recent study @xcite .",
    "thus seemingly subtle features of particle mobilities produce a significant qualitative effect : our explicit calculations show that after the new class of particle trajectories is included in an estimate for the shear - induced self - diffusivity , a quantitative agreement is obtained between the measurements of @xcite and theoretical predictions .",
    "hence , the paradox of the unusually large self - diffusivity observed by @xcite has been resolved .",

    "the position - swapping trajectories have several important consequences .",
    "first , they contribute to cross - streamline particle migration in dilute suspensions bounded by planar or nearly planar walls .",
    "in particular , this migration mechanism explains the enhanced hydrodynamic self - diffusivity observed by @xcite , as discussed in section [ mixing section ] .",
    "another important consequence of the swapping mechanism is that it prevents near - contact particle encounters .",

    "the results ( shown for each of the trajectories displayed in the middle panel ) indicate that the gap on non - swapping trajectories may decrease to about @xmath45 , whereas on the swapping trajectories @xmath46 always remains of order one .",

    "consider , for example , a pair of spheres located in a flow  vorticity plane @xmath50 , and assume that @xmath43 , i.e. , sphere 1 is to the left of sphere 2 . if @xmath51 in this configuration , sphere 2 moves from the region below sphere 1 ( where @xmath52 ) to the region above sphere 1 ( where @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , the particles initially approach each other but then they separate without passing each other  they swap their vertical positions instead",
    ".    the dependence of the relative vertical velocity @xmath31 on particle separation @xmath30 is depicted in figure [ signo vz ] for a particle pair aligned in the flow direction .",
    "the results indicate that in wall - bounded systems the relative vertical particle velocity changes sign at a critical particle separation @xmath54 that depends on the channel width and the position of the particles with respect to the walls of the channel .",
    "for @xmath55 the sign of @xmath31 is consistent with the topology of the swapping trajectories , and for @xmath56 the sign of @xmath31 corresponds to closed orbits .",
    "no such sign change , however , occurs in free space .",
    "although particle behavior on swapping trajectories seems at first counterintuitive ( the vector connecting the particle centers rotates with an angular velocity opposite to the vorticity of the external flow ) it can be qualitatively explained by considering an analogy with shear flow in a channel blocked by an obstacle .",
    "if the channel is completely blocked , the fluid dragged by a wall towards the obstacle is deflected to the other side of the channel and returns along the opposite wall . if the channel is partly blocked ( by one of the spheres in our system ) the streamlines that directly approach the obstacle are deflected and exhibit the recirculation behavior .",
    "analogously , in a two - sphere system the swapping motion of each particle is produced by the flow deflected by the other particle .    a more detailed , quantitative explanation of the swapping mechanism is obtained by analyzing the effect of the walls on the flow pattern @xmath57 around a single sphere in shear flow in a weakly confined system . to leading order in the particle  particle and particle  wall separations , the fluid velocity @xmath57 and the velocity of the second particle are identical .",
    "therefore , for weak confinements the comparison of the particle and fluid velocities has a quantitative meaning ( assuming that the interparticle distance remains sufficiently large ) , and for strongly confined systems , pair trajectories are expected to qualitatively resemble the streamlines of @xmath57 .",

    "the hydrodynamic mechanism that leads to the recirculating streamlines ( and hence to the particle position - swapping ) can be explained by examining the wall reflection @xmath48 of the perturbation flow @xmath59 produced by a sphere in external shear flow , as schematically represented in figure [ wall reflection sketch ] . only the reflection from the lower wall",
    "will be discussed because the upper wall produces an analogous effect . in our analysis",

    "the flow @xmath59 is a superposition of the @xmath68 radial stresslet contribution ( the first term on the right - hand side of the above equation ) and the @xmath69 potential contribution ( the second term ) .",

    "the horizontal plane passing through the particle center ) , the radial stresslet contribution vanishes , and the shorter - range potential - flow contribution is vertical , with an orientation consistent with the vorticity of the external flow .",
    "relation ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) indicates that at the wall surface ( i.e.  the plane @xmath72 ) the perturbation flow @xmath59 points downwards for @xmath73 and upwards for @xmath74 . to ensure that there is no fluid flux through the wall , the flow reflected from the wall , @xmath48 , must point in the opposite direction .",
    "therefore , assuming that the vertical component of @xmath48 is a monotonic function of @xmath26 ( at least up to the particle position ) , we find that the reflected flow @xmath48 has the direction needed to produce the recirculating streamlines ( cf .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath48 decays as @xmath75 with the distance @xmath76 from the image singularity at @xmath77 ( the image flow involves the reflection of the stresslet ) .",

    "we focus on the transverse diffusivity of a tagged particle in a dilute suspension of mechanically identical spheres .    as shown by @xcite in their paper on the shear - induced self - diffusivity in a dilute suspension of rough spheres",

    "* ) , the transverse ( cross - streamline ) self - diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , can be evaluated from the relation @xmath133 where the integration is over the upstream region of transverse relative coordinates corresponding to particle encounters of a given type ( e.g. , swapping or direct particle collisions ) , @xmath124 is the particle number density and @xmath134 is the cross - streamline displacement of the particle during a binary - encounter event .",
    "since initially the particles are well separated in the streamline direction , the relative upstream velocity @xmath135 is the difference of the velocities @xmath136 of individual , non - interacting spheres at the positions @xmath90 and @xmath137 with respect to the channel walls . for particles far from the walls we simply have @xmath138 . more generally , assuming that the initial particle offset @xmath28 is sufficiently small",
    ", the relative particle velocity @xmath118 can be expressed as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the dimensionless derivative of the velocity of an individual sphere with respect to its transverse position in the channel . according to our results @xcite ,",
    "the velocity of a single sphere undergoing shear flow in a parallel - wall channel differs very little from the local fluid velocity ( [ external velocity ] ) , except when the particle is in the immediate wall proximity .",
    "therefore , the approximation @xmath141 is often sufficient .",
    "particles on swapping trajectories exchange their vertical positions , which implies that the particle displacement @xmath134 equals the upstream offset @xmath28 of the particles in the interacting pair . using the above result and relation ( [ upstream relative velocity ] ) ,",
    "the integral with respect to @xmath28 in equation ( [ self - diffusivity general formula ] ) can be explicitly performed over the swapping trajectory region .",
    "the effective self - diffusivity can thus be determined from the resulting one - dimensional integral @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the upstream vertical particle offset on the trajectory that delimits the region of swapping trajectories ( cf .",
    "the contour plots in the top panel of figure [ boundary lines a ] ) .",
    "rephrased in terms of the volume fraction @xmath144 and dimensionless particle offsets @xmath145 and @xmath146 , equation ( [ self - diffusivity swap ] ) yields @xmath147 where @xmath148    the dimensionless self - diffusion coefficient @xmath126 depends on the position @xmath26 of the particle pair across the channel .",
    "since the problem is non - local , we assign @xmath26 to be the position of the particle pair when it crosses the horizontal plane @xmath94 .    our numerical results for the swapping contribution ( [ self - diffusivity swap  non - dimensional integral ] ) to the effective self - diffusion coefficient",
    "are presented in figure [ plots of self - diffusivity ] .",
    "the left panel shows @xmath126 versus @xmath26 for several values of channel widths , and the right panel shows the self - diffusivity at the channel center as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the results of our calculations indicate that for @xmath149 the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath126 achieves its maximal value at the channel center , where the swapping effect is the strongest due to the superposition of the flow reflected from two walls .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath150 the maximum occurs at the distance @xmath151 from each wall .",
    "the results also show that particle migration is suppressed near the walls , which is consistent with the observation that the vertical extent of the particle - swapping domain is small near the walls ( cf .  the bottom panels of figure [ boundary lines a ] ) .",
    "the effect of the decreased self - diffusivity in the near - wall regions is reflected in the shapes of the density profiles depicted in figure [ mixing ] .",
    "the behavior of @xmath126 for @xmath152 can be determined by combining relations ( [ z offset for large h ] ) and ( [ self - diffusivity swap  non - dimensional integral ] ) and recalling that the lateral extent @xmath131 of the swapping region scales with @xmath5 for the large channel width ( as depicted in the top panel of figure [ boundary lines a ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we obtain the relation @xmath153 where @xmath154 depends on the position of the particle pair across the channel @xmath102 . for particles in the midplane @xmath104",
    "we find @xmath155 , according to the results shown in the inset of the right panel of figure [ plots of self - diffusivity ] .",
    "while the mechanism for particle migration due to the swapping trajectories has not been proposed so far , the effect of the swapping motions was observed when @xcite reported unusually large values of the hydrodynamic self - diffusivity for a dilute suspension of spheres undergoing shear flow in a couette device .",
    "their measurements gave the result @xmath156 ( where @xmath157 is the particle radius ) for the low - density self - diffusion coefficient , whereas the estimate of the contribution due to particle roughness was at least four times smaller : it ranged from @xmath158 to @xmath159 , depending on the assumed roughness amplitude .",
    "this discrepancy has been unaccounted for , and the result of @xcite experiment has been puzzling .    by analyzing the effect of the channel walls on particle motion we provide a simple explanation for the anomalous value of the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "the @xcite measurements were performed in a channel with wall separation @xmath160 . for this geometry",
    "we find that the swapping contribution to the self - diffusion coefficient in the center of a channel is @xmath161 .",
    "moreover , in the whole central region the diffusivity @xmath162 only weakly depends on the position @xmath26 , according to the results shown in figure [ plots of self - diffusivity ] . assuming the upper limit of the roughness parameter @xmath163 quoted by @xcite , we find @xmath164 ( note that @xmath165 is slightly smaller than the corresponding value in infinite space because the swapping mechanism reduces the rate of direct particle collisions ) . combining the swapping and roughness contributions , we obtain @xmath166 for the total self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "our result agrees with the experimental value with accuracy of 15% .    in this paper",
    "we focus on systems of equal - size spheres but wall - induced cross - streamline particle migration also occurs in bidisperse or polydisperse suspensions .",
    "we note that in such suspensions , migration resulting from particle roughness is significantly smaller than in monodisperse ones @xcite .",
    "thus in polydisperse systems particle swapping constitutes the dominant particle migration mechanism even if there is significant particle roughness .",
    "moreover , cross - streamline displacements of two different - size particles undergoing a binary swapping encounter differ because there is no fore  aft symmetry .",
    "it follows that the total suspension density is affected by the swapping trajectories , in addition to the migration of individual particle species .",
    "in contrast , in monodisperse suspensions the total density can not be altered by position - swapping binary encounters .",
    "the key finding of our study is that confining walls can qualitatively change the topology of binary encounters of spherical particles in suspension flows .",
    "specifically , we have identified a new class of binary trajectories that result in cross - streamline particle migration in a wall - bounded shear flow .",
    "equal - size spheres on such trajectories do not pass each other ( as in an unbounded system ) but , instead , they exchange their transverse positions . while our explicit calculations are limited to equal - size spherical particles in shear flow bounded by parallel planar walls , we expect that a similar effect also exists for pressure - driven flows , particles of different sizes , and other wall geometries .",
    "we have shown that the cross - streamline particle motion is driven by the wall reflection of the scattered flow produced by the particles .",
    "namely , the reflection of the flow produced by one of the spheres pushes the other approaching sphere across the streamlines of the external flow towards the fluid region moving in the opposite direction . due to this mutual interaction ,",
    "the particles turn around and return to infinity without passing each other  they exchange their vertical positions instead .",
    "the significance of our results stems from the fact that the wall - induced transverse particle displacements associated with position - swapping binary encounters constitute the sole mechanism for cross - streamline migration of spherical non - brownian particles at low suspension concentrations ( if there are no non - hydrodynamic forces ) .",
    "such migration was indeed observed by @xcite who found anomalously large self - diffusion coefficient in a confined suspension of spheres . up till now , however , their measurements have remained unexplained . in this paper",
    "we show that the swapping mechanism quantitatively explains the unexpected results of their experiments .",
    "a sequence of uncorrelated binary position - swapping particle encounters in a monodisperse suspension causes a macroscopic self - diffusion process . in multi - component systems a sequence of such encounters results in mutual diffusivity .",
    "moreover , the swapping trajectories produce migration not only in the velocity - gradient direction ( considered herein ) but also in the direction of fluid vorticity .",
    "in addition to our two - particle results , we have found that in the wall presence there is a domain of recirculating streamlines around a single sphere in shear flow .",
    "such recirculating streamlines result in fluid mixing in suspension flows , so this phenomenon may have important microfluidic applications .",
    "furthermore , the trajectory reversal associated with particle swapping behavior may prevent near - contact particle encounters by causing the particles to separate before arriving into a near - contact configuration .",
    "such a hydrodynamic shielding effect may be especially important for a chain of particles with slightly different cross - streamline positions in a microfluidic channel .",
    "thus , proper understanding of the position - swapping mechanism may contribute towards finding better methods of controlling particle motions in microfluidic devices .",
    "other consequences of the particle - swapping mechanism will be described in our forthcoming publications . in particular",
    ", we will show that binary particle collisions in a dilute suspension under shear may produce a layered particle distribution .",
    "our preliminary results concerning such a layering process have already been presented @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank our reviewers for calling our attention to the experimental results by @xcite , and for providing some alternative explanations of the swapping mechanism .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge helpful suggestions by david leighton regarding explanation of the swapping mechanism in terms of the wall reflection of the stresslet , using equation ( [ self - diffusivity swap ",
    "non - dimensional integral ] ) to evaluate the self - diffusion coefficient , and showing the asymptotic relation ( [ scaling of diffusivity with gap ] ) .",

    "according to the @xcite expression , the wall reflection @xmath48 of the flow field ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) in a rigid wall at @xmath23 can be expressed by the following formulas @xcite , @xmath167 where @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 in the above relations , @xmath64 is the coordinate relative to the source position , @xmath171 is the identity tensor , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 is the reflection operator with respect to the plane @xmath23 , @xmath174(x , y , z)={\\bf i}_z\\cdot{\\bf w}(x , y ,- z).\\ ] ] by inserting ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) into ( [ lorentz reflection ] ) and evaluating the order of magnitude of different terms , we find that the overall decay of the reflected flow @xmath48 with the wall - particle distance @xmath90 is @xmath175 . equations ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) and ( [ lorentz reflection ] ) also indicate that the vertical component @xmath87 is an odd function of the variable @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath176 we find @xmath177    for a given polar angle @xmath111 , equation ( [ leading - order behavior of image flow ] ) is obtained from ( [ scaling of flow reflected from rigid wall ] ) and an assumption that @xmath178 . to obtain relation ( [ scaling of delta crit ] ) , we use ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) , ( [ leading - order behavior of image flow ] ) , and the observation that the dependence of both @xmath179 and @xmath87 on the polar angle @xmath111 is @xmath180 ( which follows from symmetry , as explained in appendix [ new appendix ] ) .",
    "the critical interparticle distance @xmath54 does not depend on the orientation of the particle pair in the plane @xmath94 , which can be shown by decomposing the external flow ( [ external velocity ] ) into the longitudinal component ( along the line connecting particle centers ) and transverse component ( normal to this line ) , @xmath181 by symmetry , the transverse velocity @xmath182 does not produce any vertical particle motion .",
    "therefore , only the longitudinal problem defines the location of zeroes of @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the location of points @xmath41 does not vary with the magnitude of the projection @xmath183 .",
    "thus the distance @xmath54 is independent of the orientation of the vector @xmath184 .    by a similar argument",
    "one can demonstrate that the upstream swapping - trajectory domain in the variables ( @xmath185 ) is delimited by a straight line section @xmath186 for @xmath187 ( as shown in the top panel of figure [ boundary lines a ] ) .",
    "the straight - line section corresponds to trajectories that pass through the circle of zeros of @xmath31 . since the transverse component @xmath182 of the external flow does not produce any vertical particle motion , for all initial orientations of the particle pair on the circle @xmath97 the vertical evolution of the particles is thus the same , except for a varying time scale .    using the flow decomposition ( [ flow decomposition ] ) one",
    "can also show that for a given @xmath188 , the vertical velocity @xmath31 varies as @xmath180 with the polar angle @xmath111 of the relative - position vector @xmath184 ( @xmath31 varies with @xmath111 in the same way as the flow component @xmath189 .",
    "the plots of @xmath31 vs @xmath30 shown in figure [ signo vz ] are thus sufficient to determine @xmath31 for all orientations of a particle pair in a given plane @xmath50 .",
    "we would also like to mention that our numerical results indicate that additional changes of sign in the relative vertical velocity @xmath31 may occur at large interparticle distances .",
    "this would lead to more complex particle recirculation patterns than those described herein .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath190 at large distances is extremely small due to the exponential decay of the vertical velocity @xcite . therefore , domains of trajectories with different topology are limited to very small regions in the configurational space .",
    "we note that multiple changes in sign of the velocity field in a parallel - wall channel were described by @xcite for a flow produced by a vertical rotlet .",
    "as we have shown in our previous publications @xcite , the vertical velocity components for two spheres in stokes flow in a parallel - wall channel decay exponentially on the lengthscale @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the vertical offset of the particles along the pair trajectory evolves only for @xmath191 .",
    "the relative lateral velocity of the particles in shear flow ( [ external velocity ] ) is @xmath192 , where @xmath28 is a typical vertical offset along the trajectory .",
    "therefore , @xmath193 is the timescale for the evolution of the vertical particle positions . during the time interval ( [ time scale for vertical evolution ] )",
    "the vertical offset @xmath28 may attain the magnitude @xmath194 where @xmath31 is the typical value of the vertical component of the relative particle velocity .    according to equation ( [ flow scattered by sphere in unbounded shear flow ] ) , the perturbation velocity field @xmath59 produced by a spherical particle of diameter @xmath4 in an unbounded shear flow with the shear rate @xmath19 scales as @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the distance from the particle . in a wall - bounded system , this perturbation flow interacts with the walls at the distance @xmath197 and then acts on the second particle at a distance @xmath198 , producing its vertical motion .",
    "therefore , the relative vertical velocity of the particles has the magnitude @xmath199 relation ( [ z offset for large h ] ) is obtained by combining equations ( [ time scale for vertical evolution])([magnitude of z velocity ] ) ."
