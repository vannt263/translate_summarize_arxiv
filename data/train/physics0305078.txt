    "the analysis of river flows has a long history .",
    "already more than half a century ago hurst found by means of his @xmath13 analysis that annual runoff records from various rivers ( including the nile river ) exhibit `` long - range statistical dependencies '' @xcite , indicating that the fluctuations in water storage and runoff processes are self - similar over a wide range of time scales , with no single characteristic scale .",
    "hurst s finding is now recognized as the first example for self - affine fractal behaviour in empirical time series , see e.g. @xcite . in the 1960s ,",
    "the `` hurst phenomenon '' was investigated on a broader empirical basis for many other natural phenomena @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the fluctuations with time is reflected by the scaling of the power spectrum @xmath14 with frequency @xmath15 , @xmath16 . for stationary time",
    "series the exponent @xmath17 is related to the decay of the corresponding autocorrelation function @xmath0 of the runoffs ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) . for @xmath17 between 0 and 1",
    ", @xmath0 decays by a power law , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being restricted to the interval between 0 and 1 . in this case , the mean correlation time diverges , and the system is regarded as long - term correlated . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the runoff data are uncorrelated on large time scales ( `` white noise '' ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath2 can also be determined from a fluctuation analysis , where the departures from the mean daily runoffs are considered as increments of a random walk process .",
    "if the runoffs are uncorrelated , the fluctuation function @xmath21 , which is equivalent to the root - mean - square displacement of the random walk , increases as the square root of the time scale @xmath22 , @xmath23 . for long - term correlated data ,",
    "the random walk becomes anomalous , and @xmath24 .",
    "the fluctuation exponent @xmath25 is related to the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath2 via @xmath26 . for monofractal data ,",
    "@xmath25 is identical to the classical hurst exponent .",
    "recently , many studies using these kinds of methods have dealt with scaling properties of hydrological records and the underlying statistics , see e.  g. @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional methods discussed above may fail when trends are present in the system .",
    "trends are systematic deviations from the average runoff that are caused by external processes , e.g. the construction of a water regulation device , the seasonal cycle , or a changing climate ( e.g. _ global warming _ ) .",
    "monotonous trends may lead to an overestimation of the hurst exponent and thus to an underestimation of @xmath2 .",
    "it is even possible that uncorrelated data , under the influence of a trend , look like long - term correlated ones when using the above analysis methods . in addition , long - term correlated data can not simply be detrended by the common technique of moving averages , since this method destroys the correlations on long time scales ( above the window size used ) . furthermore , it is difficult to distinguish trends from long - term correlations , because stationary long - term correlated time series exhibit persistent behaviour and a tendency to stay close to the momentary value",
    "this causes positive or negative deviations from the average value for long periods of time that might look like a trend .    in the last years",
    ", several methods such as wavelet techniques ( wt ) and detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , have been developed that are able to determine long - term correlations in the presence of trends .",
    "for details and applications of the methods to a large number of meteorological , climatological and biological records we refer to @xcite . the methods , described in section 2 , consider fluctuations in the cumulated runoffs ( often called the `` profile '' or `` landscape '' of the record ) .",
    "they differ in the way the fluctuations are determined and in the type of polynomial trend that is eliminated in each time window of size @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    ", we apply these detrending methods to study the scaling of the fluctuations @xmath21 of river flows with time @xmath22 .",
    "we focus on 23 runoff records from international river stations spread around the globe and compare the results with those of 18 river stations from southern germany .",
    "we find that above some crossover time ( typically several weeks ) @xmath21 scales as @xmath27 with @xmath25 varying from river to river between 0.55 and 0.95 in a nonuniversal manner independent of the size of the basin .",
    "the lowest exponent @xmath28 was obtained for rivers on permafrost ground .",
    "our finding is not consistent with the hypothesis that the scaling is universal with an exponent close to 0.75 @xcite with the same power law being applicable for all time scales from minutes till centuries .",
    "the above detrending approaches , however , are not sufficient to fully characterize the complex dynamics of river flows , since they exclusively focus on the variance which can be regarded as the second moment @xmath21 of the full distribution of the fluctuations .",
    "note that the hurst method actually focuses on the first moment @xmath29 . to further characterize a hydrological record",
    ", we extend the study to include all moments @xmath30 .",
    "a detailed description of the method , which is a multifractal generalization of the detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite and equivalent to the wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method @xcite , is given in section 3 .",
    "our approach differs from the multifractal approach introduced into hydrology by lovejoy and schertzer ( see e.g. @xcite ) that was based on the concept of structure functions @xcite and on the assumption of the existence of a universal cascade model .",
    "here we perform the multifractal analysis by studying how the different moments of the fluctuations @xmath30 scale with time @xmath22 , see also @xcite .",
    "we find that at large time scales , @xmath30 scales as @xmath31 , and a simple functional form with two parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , @xmath32/[q\\ln(2)]$ ] describes the scaling exponent @xmath33 of all moments . on small time",
    "scales , however , a stronger multifractality is observed that may be partly related to the seasonal trend .",
    "the mean position of the crossover between the two regimes is of the order of weeks and increases with @xmath6 .",
    "consider a record of daily water runoff values @xmath34 measured at a certain hydrological station .",
    "the index @xmath35 counts the days in the record , @xmath36,2,  ,@xmath37 . to eliminate the periodic seasonal trends , we concentrate on the departures @xmath38 from the mean daily runoff @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath39 is calculated for each calendar date @xmath35 ( e.g. april 1@xmath40 ) by averaging over all years in the runoff series .",
    "in addition , we checked that our actual results remained unchanged when also seasonal trends in the variance have been eliminated by analysing @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "the runoff autocorrelation function @xmath0 describes , how the persistence decays in time .",
    "if the @xmath42 are uncorrelated , @xmath0 is zero for all @xmath22 .",

    "is hindered by the level of noise present in the finite hydrological records , and by nonstationarities in the data .",
    "there are several alternative methods for calculating the correlation function in the presence of long - term correlations , which we describe in the following sections",
    ".      if the time series is stationary , we can apply standard spectral analysis techniques and calculate the power spectrum @xmath14 of the time series @xmath34 as a function of the frequency @xmath15 . for long - term correlated data",
    ", we have @xmath46 where @xmath17 is related to the correlation exponent @xmath2 by @xmath47 .",

    "the wavelet methods we employ here are based on the determination of the mean values @xmath70 of the profile in each segment @xmath55 ( of length @xmath22 ) , and the calculation of the fluctuations between neighbouring segments .",
    "the different order techniques we have used in analyzing runoff fluctuations differ in the way the fluctuations between the average profiles are treated and possible nonstationarities are eliminated .",
    "the first- , second- and third - order wavelet method are described below .",
    "\\(i ) in the first - order wavelet method ( wt1 ) , one simply determines the fluctuations from the first derivative @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "wt1 corresponds to fa where constant trends in the profile of a hydrological station are eliminated , while linear trends are not eliminated .",
    "\\(ii ) in the second - order wavelet method ( wt2 ) , one determines the fluctuations from the second derivative @xmath72 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "so , if the profile consists of a trend term linear in @xmath22 and a fluctuating term , the trend term is eliminated .",

    ", wt3 eliminates linear and parabolic trend terms in the profile .",
    "in general , in wt@xmath52 we determine the fluctuations from the @xmath52th derivative , this way eliminating trends described by @xmath66st - order polynomials in the data .    methods ( i - iii ) are called wavelet methods , since they can be interpreted as transforming the profile by discrete wavelets representing first- , second- and third - order cumulative derivatives of the profile .",
    "the first - order wavelets are known in the literature as haar wavelets .",
    "one can also use different shapes of the wavelets ( e.g. gaussian wavelets with width @xmath22 ) , which have been used by @xcite to study , for example , long - range correlations in dna .",
    "since the various stages of the wavelet methods wt1 , wt2 , wt3 , etc .",
    "have different detrending capabilities , a comparison of their fluctuation functions can yield insight into both long - term correlations and types of trends .    at the end of this section , before describing the results of the fa , dfa , and wt analysis , we note that for very large @xmath22 values , @xmath74 for dfa and @xmath75 for fa and wt , the fluctuation function becomes inaccurate due to statistical errors .",
    "the difference in the statistics is due to the fact that the number of independent segments of length @xmath22 is larger in dfa than in wt , and the fluctuations in fa are larger than in dfa .",
    "hence , in the analysis we will concentrate on @xmath22 values lower than @xmath76 for dfa and @xmath77 for fa and wt . when determining the scaling exponents @xmath25 using eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , we manually chose an appropriate ( shorter ) fitting range of typically two orders of magnitude .      in our study",
    "we analyzed 41 runoff records , 18 of them are from the southern part of germany , and the rest is from north and south america , africa , australia , asia and europe ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we begin the analysis with the runoff record for the river weser in the northern part of germany , which has the longest record ( 171 years ) in this study .",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the fluctuation functions @xmath21 obtained from fa and dfa1-dfa5 . in the log - log plot ,",
    "the curves are approximately straight lines for @xmath22 above 30 days , with a slope @xmath78 .",
    "this result for the weser suggests that there exists long - term persistence expressed by the power - law decay of the correlation function , with an exponent @xmath79 [ see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) ] .    to show that the slope @xmath78 is due to long - term correlations and not due to a broad probability distribution ( joseph- versus noah - phenomenon , see @xcite ) ,",
    "we have eliminated the correlations by randomly shuffling the @xmath42 .",
    "this shuffling has no effect on the probability distribution function of @xmath42 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows @xmath21 for the shuffled data .",
    "we obtain @xmath64 , showing that the exponent @xmath78 is due to long - term correlations .",
    "to show that the slope @xmath78 is not an artefact of the seasonal dependence of the variance and skew , we also considered records where @xmath42 was divided by the variance of each calendary day and applied further detrending techniques that take into account the skew @xcite . in both cases , we found no change in the scaling behaviour for large times ( see also sect .",
    "this can be understood easily , since kinds of seasonal trends can not effect the fluctuation behaviour on time scales well above one year .",
    "it is likely , however , that the seasonal dependencies of the variance and possibly also of the skew contribute to the behaviour at small times , where the slope @xmath25 is much larger than 0.75 in most cases ( see also sect .",
    "3.4 , where a seasonal trend in the variance is indeed used for modelling the crossover ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the fluctuation functions @xmath21 of 4 more rivers , from africa , south america , australia , and europe .",
    "the panels on the left - hand side show the fa and dfa1 - 4 curves , while the panels on the right - hand side show the results from the analogous wavelet analysis wt1-wt5 .",
    "most curves show a crossover at small time scales ; a similar crossover has been reported by @xcite for small french rivers without artificial dams or reservoirs . above the crossover time",

    "accordingly , there is no universal scaling behaviour since the long - term exponents vary strongly from river to river and reflect the fact that there exist different mechanisms for floods where each may induce different scaling .",
    "this is in contrast to climate data , where universal long - term persistence of temperature records at land stations was observed @xcite .",
    "the mary river in australia is rather dry in the summer and the gaula river in norway is frozen in the winter . for the mary river ,",
    "the long - term exponent @xmath82 is well below the average value .",
    "for the gaula river , the long - term correlations are not pronounced ( @xmath28 ) and even hard to distinguish from the uncorrelated case @xmath84 .",
    "we obtained similar results for the other two `` frozen '' rivers ( tana from norway and dvina from russia ) that we analysed . for interpreting this distinguished behaviour of the frozen rivers we like to note that on permafrost ground the lateral inflow ( and hence the indirect contribution of the water storage in the catchment basin ) contributes to the runoffs in a different way than on normal ground ,",
    "see also _ gupta and dawdy _ [ 1995 ] .",
    "our results ( based on 3 rivers only ) suggest that the contribution of snow melting leads to less correlated runoffs than the contribution of rainfall , but more comprehensive studies will be needed to confirm this interesting result .",
    "figure 3(a ) and table 1 summarize our results for @xmath25 .",
    "one can see clearly that the exponents @xmath25 do not depend systematically on the basin area @xmath85 .",
    "this is in line with the conclusions of @xcite for the flood peaks , where a systematic dependence on @xmath85 could also not be found .",
    "there is also no pronounced regional dependence : the rivers within a localized area ( such as south germany ) tend to have nearly the same range of exponents as the international rivers .",
    "the three  frozen ",
    "rivers in our study have the lowest values of @xmath25 . as can be seen in the figure , the exponents spread from 0.55 to 0.95 . since the correlation exponent @xmath2 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath86 , the exponent @xmath2 spreads from almost 0 to almost 1 , covering the whole range from very weak to very strong correlations .",
    "for a further characterization of hydrological records it is meaningful to extend eq .",

    "the question is , how the fluctuation functions depend on @xmath6 and how this dependence is related to multifractal features of the record .    in general ,",

    "since for stationary records , @xmath94 is identical to the well - known hurst exponent ( see e.  g. @xcite ) , we will call the function @xmath33 the generalized hurst exponent . for monofractal self - affine time series",
    ", @xmath33 is independent of @xmath6 , since the scaling behaviour of the variances @xmath57 is identical for all segments @xmath55 , and the averaging procedure in eq .",
    "( [ faq ] ) will give just this identical scaling behaviour for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "if small and large fluctuations scale differently , there will be a significant dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath6 : if we consider positive values of @xmath6 , the segments @xmath55 with large variance @xmath57 ( i.  e. large deviations from the corresponding fit ) will dominate the average @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for positive values of @xmath6 , @xmath33 describes the scaling behaviour of the segments with large fluctuations .",

    "the figure shows that there are rivers with quite strong multifractal fluctuations , i.e. large @xmath122 , and one with almost vanishing multifractality , i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "two observation can be made from the figure : ( 1 ) there is no pronounced difference between the width of the distribution of the multifractality strength for the runoffs within the local area of southern germany ( open symbols in fig .",
    "3(b ) ) and for the international runoff records from all rivers around the globe ( full symbols ) . in fact , without rivers zaire and grand river the widths would be the same .",
    "( 2 ) there is a tendency towards smaller multifractality strengths at larger basin areas .",
    "this means that the river flows become less nonlinear with increasing basin area .",
    "we consider this as possible indication of river regulations that are more pronounced for large river basins .    our results for @xmath124 ( see eq .",
    "( [ kbin ] ) and table 1 ) may be compared with the functional form @xmath125 with the three parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , that have been used by lovejoy , schertzer , and coworkers @xcite successfully to describe the multifractal behaviour of rainfall and runoff records .",
    "the definition of @xmath97 we used in this paper is taken from @xcite and differs slightly from their definition .",

    "( [ kbin ] ) for @xmath97 is not only valid for positive @xmath6 values , but also for negative @xmath6 values .",
    "this feature allows us to determine numerically the full singularity spectrum @xmath99 . in the analysis we focused on long time scales , excluding the crossover regime , and",
    "used detrending methods .",
    "we consider it as particularly interesting that only two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 or , equivalently , @xmath25 and @xmath129 , are sufficient to describe @xmath5 and @xmath97 for positive as well as negative @xmath6 values .",
    "this strongly supports the idea of universal multifractal behaviour of river runoffs as suggested ( in different context ) by lovejoy and schertzer .",
    "it is interesting to note that the generalized fluctuation functions we studied do not show any kind of multifractal phase transition at some critical value @xmath130 in the @xmath6-regime ( @xmath131 ) we analysed .",
    "instead , our analysis shows a crossover at a specific time scale @xmath43 ( typically weeks ) that weakly increases with decreasing moment @xmath6 . in this paper",
    ", we concentrated on the large - time regime ( @xmath132 ) , where we obtained coherent multifractal behaviour and did not see any indication for a multifractal phase transition .",
    "but this does not exclude the possibility that at small scales a breakdown of mulifractality at a critical @xmath6-value may occur , as has been emphasized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the following , we like to motivate the 2-parameter formula eq .",
    "( [ hbin2 ] ) and show how it can be obtained from the well known multifractal cascade model @xcite . in the model , a record @xmath133 of length @xmath134 is constructed recursively as follows : in generation @xmath135 , the record elements are constant , i.e. @xmath136 for all @xmath137 . in the first step of the cascade ( generation @xmath138 ) , the first half of the series is multiplied by a factor @xmath10 and the second half of the series is multiplied by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "this yields @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are between zero and one , @xmath143 . note that we do not restrict the model to @xmath144 as is often done in the literature @xcite . in the second step ( generation @xmath145 )",
    ", we apply the process of step 1 to the two subseries , yielding @xmath146 for @xmath147 , @xmath148 for @xmath149 , @xmath150 for @xmath151 , and @xmath152 for @xmath153 . in general , in step @xmath154 , each subseries of step @xmath52 is divided into two subseries of equal length , and the first half of the @xmath133 is multiplied by @xmath10 while the second half is multiplied by @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in generation @xmath155 the values in the eight subseries are @xmath156 .",
    "after @xmath157 steps , the final generation has been reached , where all subseries have length 1 and no more splitting is possible .",
    "we note that the final record can be written as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the number of digits 1 in the binary representation of the index @xmath160 , e.  g. @xmath161 , since 13 corresponds to binary 1101 .    for this multiplicative cascade model ,",

    "thus , in this form the model is limited to cases where @xmath94 , which is the exponent hurst defined originally in the @xmath13 method , is equal to one . in order to generalize this multifractal cascade process such that any value of @xmath94 is possible",
    ", we have subtracted the offset @xmath165 from @xmath33 .",
    "the constant offset @xmath166 corresponds to additional long - term correlations incorporated in the multiplicative cascade model . for generating records without this offset ,",
    "we rescale the power spectrum .",
    "first , we fast - fourier transform ( fft ) the simple multiplicative cascade data into the frequency domain .",
    "then , we multiply all fourier coefficients by @xmath167 , where @xmath15 is the frequency . this way , the slope @xmath17 of the power spectra @xmath16 ( the squares of the fourier coefficients ) is decreased from @xmath168 /\\ln 2 $ ] into @xmath169   - 1 = -\\ln(a^2 + b^2 ) /\\ln 2 $ ] , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ hbin2 ] ) .",
    "finally , backward fft is employed to transform the signal back into the time domain .",
    "a similar fourier filtering technique has been used by @xcite when generating surrogate runoff data .      in order to see how well the extended multiplicative cascade model fits to the real data ( for a given river )",
    ", we generate the model data as follows : ( i ) we determine @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the given river ( by best fit of eq .",
    "( [ hbin2 ] ) ) , ( ii ) we generate the simple multiplicative cascade model with the obtained @xmath10 and @xmath11 values , and ( iii ) we implement the proper long - term correlations as described above .",
    "figure 8(a ) shows the dfa analysis of the model data with parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 determined for the river weser . by comparing with fig .",
    "4(a ) we see that the extended model gives the correct scaling of the fluctuation functions @xmath30 on time scales above the crossover . by comparing fig .",
    "8(b ) with fig .",
    "4(c ) we see that the shuffled model series becomes uncorrelated without multifractality similar to the shuffled data . below the crossover , however , the model does not yield the observed @xmath30 in the original data . in the following",
    "we show that in order to obtain the proper behaviour below the crossover , either seasonal trends that can not be completely eliminated from the data or a different type of multifractality below the crossover , represented by different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have to be introduced .    to show the effect of seasonal trends , we have multiplied the elements @xmath42 of the extended cascade model by @xmath170 , this way generating a seasonal trend of period 365 in the variance .",
    "figure 8(c ) shows the dfa4 result for the generalized fluctuation functions , which now better resembles the real data than fig .",
    "8(a ) . finally , in fig .",
    "8(d ) we show the effect of a different multifractality below the crossover , where different parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterize this regime .",
    "the results also show better agreement with the real data . when comparing figs .  8(a , c , d ) with figs .  4 and 5",
    ", it seems that the danube , amper and wertach fit better to fig .",
    "8(d ) , i.e. suggesting different multifractality for short and large time scales , while the weser , susquehanna and niger fit better to fig .",
    "8(c ) where seasonal trends in the variance ( and possibly in the skew ) are responsible for the behaviour below the crossover .",
    "in this study , we analyzed the scaling behaviour of daily runoff time series of 18 representative rivers in southern germany and 23 international rivers using both detrended fluctuation analysis and wavelet techniques . in all cases we found that the fluctuations exhibit self - affine scaling behaviour and long - term persistence on time scales ranging from weeks to decades .",
    "the fluctuation exponent @xmath25 varies from river to river in a wide range between 0.55 and 0.95 , showing non - universal scaling behaviour .",
    "we also studied the multifractal properties of the runoff time series using a multifractal generalization of the dfa method that was crosschecked with the wtmm technique .",
    "we found that the multifractal spectra of all 41 records can be described by a universal function @xmath9 , which can be obtained from a generalization of the multiplicative cascade model and has solely two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 or , equivalently , the fluctuation exponent @xmath171 and the width @xmath172 of the singularity spectrum .",
    "since our function for @xmath5 applies also for negative @xmath6 values , we could derive the singularity spectra @xmath99 from the fits .",
    "we have calculated and listed the values of @xmath25 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath121 for all records considered .",
    "there are no significant differences between their distributions for rivers in south germany and for international rivers .",
    "we also found that there is no significant dependence of these parameters on the size of the basin area , but there is a slight decrease of the multifractal width @xmath121 with increasing basin area .",
    "we suggest that the values of @xmath25 and @xmath121 can be regarded as fingerprints for each station or river , which can serve as an efficient non - trivial test bed for the state - of - the - art precipitation - runoff models .    apart from the practical use of eq .",
    "( [ hbin2 ] ) with the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 that was derived by extending the multiplicative cascade model and that can serve as finger prints for the river flows , we presently are lacking a physical model for this behaviour .",
    "it will be interesting to see , if physically based models , e.g. the random tree - structure model presented in @xcite , can be related to the multiplicative cascade model presented here .",
    "if so , this would give a physical explanation for how the multiplicative cascade model is able to simulate river flows .",
    "we have also investigated the origin of the multifractal scaling behaviour by comparison with the corresponding shuffled data .",
    "we found that the multifractality is removed by shuffling that destroys the time correlations in the series while the distribution of the runoff values is not altered .",
    "after shuffling , we obtain @xmath173 for all values of @xmath6 , indicating monofractal behaviour .",
    "hence , our results suggest that the multifractality is not due to the existence of a broad , asymmetric ( singular ) probability density distribution @xcite , but due to a specific dynamical arrangement of the values in the time series , i.e. a self - similar clustering of time patterns of values on different time scales .",
    "we believe that our results will be useful also to improve the understanding of extreme values ( singularities ) in the presence of multifractal long - term correlations and trends .    finally , for an optimal water management in a given basin , it is essential to know , whether an observed long - term fluctuation in discharge data is due to systematic variations ( trends ) or the results of long - term correlation .",
    "our approach is also a step forward in this directions .",
