    "our understanding of the formation of the milky way is seriously hampered by our inability to reliably measure ages of stars . in recent years",
    ", asteroseismology has been been demonstrated as a promising method to estimate fundamental stellar properties , including ages . from the seismology",
    "one can infer stellar radius and mass , and for red giants , mass is a good age indicator when the metallicity is known .",
    "the fact that we can access asteroseismic information for a large number of stars , due to missions like _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , _ corot _ , and now also k2 @xcite , means that we can start using this information to unravel the formation history of the milky way .",
    "we can use asteroseismic information to model the milky way within the framework of stellar population synthesis .",
    "such models generate a synthetic catalog of stars for a given prescription of galactic structure and evolution .",
    "the predictions can then be directly compared to observations .",
    "a few such models are publicly available and have been developed and fine tuned to satisfy observational constraints from various photometric , spectroscopic , and astrometric surveys .",
    "these include _ besanon _ , trilegal and _ galaxia _ @xcite .",
    "the first study to make use of asteroseismic information to test a stellar population synthesis - based model was performed by .",
    "a more comprehensive study was carried out by @xcite , who compared the mass and radius distributions of about 400 main - sequence and subgiant stars with the trilegal stellar population synthesis model .",
    "they found that the radius distribution matched with the model predictions but the mass distribution showed significant differences . specifically , the model was found to under",
    "predict the number of low mass stars ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the _ kepler _ main - sequence / subgiant sample is small in size , is local to the sun and is dominated by young stars , which limits it applicability for detailed model comparison .    in comparison to main - sequence and subgiant stars ,",
    "red giants offer a number of advantages . for red giants",
    "the age is almost independent of luminosity .",
    "hence , for any given apparent - magnitude - limited sample , one can obtain red giants spanning a wide range in age .",
    "being luminous , they probe the galaxy further for any given apparent magnitude and allow us to sample different regions of the galaxy .",
    "the ability to sample different regions of the galaxy is essential for galactic archaeology because different regions of the galaxy are dominated by different components .",
    "for example , the fraction of old stars increases with height above the galactic mid plane .",
    "@xcite carried out a differential study of the milky way using red giants with asteroseismic information from _ corot_. using about 2000 red giants in two different regions of the galaxy , they showed that the mass distributions differ , in agreement with theoretical models .",
    "however , they did not make a direct comparison with galactic models . with _",
    ", we now have a sample of oscillating red giants that is more than an order of magnitude larger than any other asteroseismic sample that has been tested against predictions of stellar population synthesis models ( 12964 red giants by * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to use this large sample of giants in the context of modeling the galaxy .",
    "however , a significant outstanding problem of using red giants is that modeling their individual frequencies is too time consuming for the analysis of tens of thousands of stars .",
    "we therefore rely on using asteroseismic scaling relations , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , to estimate their radius and mass ( and hence age ) . here , @xmath6 is the frequency of maximum amplitude and @xmath0 the average large frequency separation .",
    "these relations assume that the structure of a red giant star is homologous with respect to the sun . in reality",
    "this assumption is not strictly correct and verification of the relations is ongoing .",
    "however , independent high - precision estimates of mass and radius required for this verification are difficult to obtain . for subgiants and dwarfs",
    ", the @xmath6 scaling relation has been shown to work well @xcite and recently , @xcite found the proportionality @xmath4 to be accurate to within 1.5% . using hipparcos parallaxes and/or interferometry ,",
    "the asteroseismic radii calculated from scaling relations have been found to be accurate to within 5% @xcite .",
    "for giants we generally do not have accurate parallaxes , so such studies are awaiting results from gaia @xcite .",
    "open clusters have been used to test the scaling relations for giants .",
    "@xcite found agreement to within 5% for scaling relation - based radii .",
    "testing of masses is more challenging .",
    "for a few cases where such verification have been performed , the scaling relation - based masses seem to be overestimated for giants . for two lower red giant branch stars @xcite find evidence that the mass estimated by using only @xmath0 ( but with additional @xmath6 independent quantities ) is lower compared to using both @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "based on this they suggested that a modification to the @xmath6 scaling relation might be required .",
    "theoretical modelling has suggested corrections to the @xmath0 scaling relation @xcite , but there has been no comprehensive study to verify the corrections . in relation to @xmath6 , and had suggested theoretically that @xmath6 coincides with the plateau of the damping rate with frequency",
    ". confirmed this for the sun using soho golf observations .",
    "@xcite suggested that this is caused by a resonance between the thermal adjustment time of the superadiabatic boundary layer and the mode frequency , which was also confirmed by the theoretical study of ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is currently no way to accurately predict @xmath6 from theory",
    ".    additionally , there are a few factors related to the _ kepler _ red giant sample that make it difficult to use them for population synthesis - based modeling .",
    "firstly , knowing the selection function of the stellar sample is an essential requirement for such an analysis .",
    "however , this function has currently not been quantified .",
    "secondly , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 band photometry in the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) differs slightly from the corresponding sloan magnitudes @xcite .",
    "this means the synthetic photometry that comes with isochrones , which is calibrated to sloan magnitudes , needs to be re - calibrated , and this has not been done .",
    "we specifically address these issues here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 , describes our methods .",
    "we first describe the galactic models that are compared against the seismic observations .",
    "next , we discuss how to map the synthetic stars of galactic models into the observational space .",
    "following this , we discuss how to convert mass and radius to asteroseismic observables and vice verse . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the _ kepler _ giant samples .",
    "we investigate corrections to the scaling relations in section 4 , and corrections to the galactic model in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we discuss implications of our findings .",
    "the main galactic stellar - population - synthesis model used in this paper is from the _ galaxia _ code @xcite .",
    "it uses a galactic model based on the _ besanon _ model by but with some modifications .",
    "_ galaxia _ uses its own 3d extinction scheme to specify the dust distribution .",
    "we also apply a low latitude correction to the dust maps as in @xcite .",
    "the isochrones to predict the stellar properties are from the padova database .",
    "the unique feature of _ galaxia _ is its novel star - spawning scheme which , unlike previous codes , does not discretize the spatial dimensions into multiple lines of sight . instead , it generates a continuous three - dimensional distribution of stars .",
    "full details of the galactic model are available in and @xcite , but here we summarize the main features . the milky way in _",
    "galaxia_/_besanon _ consists of four major components : the thin disc , the thick disc , the bar shaped bulge , and the halo .",
    "each component has its own initial mass function ( imf ) and an analytic formula for the spatial distribution of stars .",
    "the thin disc is built up using a star - formation history , while other components are assumed to be populations of fixed age . in the thin disc , the metallicity of stars",
    "is governed by an age metallicity relation and the spatial distribution of stars is governed by an age scale - height relation .",
    "the full _ besanon _ galactic model is tuned to satisfy constraints from the hipparcos mission @xcite and star counts from surveys in optical and near infrared bands .",
    "the galactic potential is computed in a self - consistent manner taking into account the results from the hipparcos mission .",
    "in addition to _ galaxia _ , we used the trilegal galactic stellar - population - synthesis model . unlike _ galaxia",
    "_ , trilegal can not generate stars over a wide angular area .",
    "therefore , we generated stars along 21 lines of sight pointing towards the centers of the 21 _ kepler _ ccd - module foot prints on sky .",
    "we used trilegal with the default settings but with binary stars turned off . for extinction ,",
    "we used the extinction model of _ galaxia_.",
    "one noticeable difference between _ galaxia _ and trilegal is that , _ galaxia _ uses a constant star formation rate , while the default setting in trilegal uses a two - step star - formation rate , in which the rate between 1 - 4 gyr is twice that at any other time .",
    "band photometry of the synthetic stars to match the kic distribution of the @xmath9 color ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the blue line is for the case with no correction .",
    "the correction also improves the fit to the @xmath10 color distribution , in regions near the red peak ( panel ( d ) ) .",
    "@xmath11 stands for probability density whose integral over the abscissa is unity .",
    "[ fig : kic_photo1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      before we can start comparing the asteroseismic results with predictions from our galactic models , we have to make sure that the photometry of stars in the kic and the galactic model predictions agree with each other .",
    "this is because the asteroseismic targets observed by _",
    "kepler _ were selected based on kic parameters , which ultimately relied in its photometric entries .",
    "if the photometry of the galactic model does not match with the kic , the model will be fundamentally inconsistent with observations , preventing meaningful model - based inferences to be made .",
    "to proceed , we first compared the photometry of the synthetic stars with that of stars in the kic and identified any differences .",
    "next , we investigated the cause of any mismatch and derive transformation formulae to rectify it .",
    "we generated a synthetic catalog of the milky way using the code _",
    "galaxia_. stars , both from the synthetic catalog and from the kic , that lie within 8 degrees from the center of the _ kepler _ field and with magnitude @xmath12 were selected for comparison .",
    "note the kic is expected to be complete to magnitudes even fainter than 14 magnitude in @xmath13 .",
    "we then added photometric errors to the stars .",
    "for this we derived the following formulas to approximate the actual photometric errors in 2mass and the kic ( figure 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : _ 2mass & = & 0.0125 + 0.01(k-12.6 ) + _ sdss & = & 0.015 + 0.01(r-16.0 ) , in , we show the distribution of @xmath13 band magnitude and various colors for both the kic ( black ) and the synthetic catalog ( blue ) .. ] the @xmath13 magnitude and the color distributions match well , which is encouraging given that we do not enforce any fine tuning of the model",
    ". however , the distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( b , d ) for the synthetic catalog are slightly redder for the giants ( right most peaks ) .",
    "the discrepancy for @xmath9 is especially large . either the @xmath14 band or the @xmath15 band photometry , or both could be discrepant .",
    "a clue to the cause of the discrepancy is provided by results of @xcite , who found systematic differences in the kic @xmath16 photometry with respect to sdss @xmath16 photometry , for a small part of the _ kepler _ field which overlaps with the sdss . because the isochrones that we use are calibrated to the sdss bands",
    ", this could partly explain the mismatch that we see with the kic . to investigate this ,",
    "we show in , a copy of b , but we add ( in green ) the @xmath9 color after applying the @xcite transformations to the kic stars .",
    "we see that this corrected kic distribution matches the predictions of _ galaxia _ ( blue ) .",
    "hence , a correction in @xmath14 band is enough to explain the mismatch seen in the distribution of @xmath9 color .",
    "the transformations proposed by @xcite were : @xmath17   \\\\ & r_{\\rm sdss }   =   r_{\\rm kic}+0.0548(r_{\\rm kic}-i_{\\rm kic})-0.0383   + [ 0.0 ]     \\\\ & i_{\\rm sdss }   =   i_{\\rm kic}+0.0696(r_{\\rm kic}-i_{\\rm kic})-0.0583   + [ 0.02 ]    \\\\ & z_{\\rm sdss }   =   z_{\\rm kic}+0.1587(i_{\\rm kic}-z_{\\rm kic})-0.0597   + [ 0.02 ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a slight adjustment of zero - points ( see square brackets ) from the original @xcite transformations was needed to make the green curve match with the _ galaxia _ prediction .",
    "note slight adjustments of zero points are quite common when comparing photometry obtained from different sources .",
    "the transformations of @xcite convert kic photometry to sdss .",
    "however , for our analysis we require the inverse transformation , that is from sdss to kic colors .",
    "this is because the stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ were selected from the kic photometry and not a re - calibrated version of it .",
    "equations [ equ : pinson_tr ] can be written in a matrix form and then inverted to get the transformation formula for @xmath18 , but this would require knowing the magnitudes in three bands @xmath19 and @xmath20 . instead , for our use , we derived a simpler formula g_kic = g_sdss-0.25(g_sdss - ddo51)+0.048 [ equ : gkic ] that makes use of only two bands , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the formula is easily invertible to @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , because @xmath21 and @xmath24 are on different photometric systems , their errors are less likely to be correlated , which means the formula given by is more robust .",
    "the formula was derived by matching the @xmath25 distribution of synthetic stars to those in the kic . the red curve in shows the results after applying to the @xmath14 band photometry of the synthetic catalog , which makes the @xmath9 color distribution of synthetic stars agree nicely with that of the kic ( black ) .",
    "this result is copied onto b. the formula was also found to improve the agreement for the @xmath10 color distribution , which is shown in d. thus , we can now successfully reproduce the photometry of the kic stars using _",
    "galaxia_. for the rest of the paper we use the above formula to transform the @xmath14 band photometry of synthetic stars to compare the results of _ galaxia _ with observations . in general",
    ", the formula should be valid for the version of padova isochrones adopted in _",
    "galaxia_. we note that @xcite has also suggested transformations from sdss to kic photometry , but those transformations ( like ours ) are specific to the adopted stellar models and to the adopted bolometric corrections .",
    "we found their transformations to be inadequate to explain the mismatch of the @xmath26 color that we encounter .",
    "distribution of stars in the kic ( black ) with the synthetic catalog generated by the code _ galaxia _ ( blue ) .",
    "the green and red distributions show the effect of different transformation formulae to convert between kic and sdss @xmath14 band magnitudes , with results of the @xcite correction applied ( equation-[equ : pinson_tr ] ) to kic stars ( from black to green ) , and results of our correction ( equation-[equ : gkic ] ) applied to stars in the synthetic catalog ( from blue to red ) .",
    "[ fig : kic_photo2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      as mentioned in the previous section , stellar targets of the _ kepler _ mission were selected based on stellar parameters in the kic , such as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters were derived from photometry as part of the stellar classification project ( hereafter scp ) . as part of the scp",

    ", one has to specify the photometric bands to be used and the photometric uncertainty in each band . while the kic contains photometry in 10 bands , we chose to use only the following eight @xmath29 that are available for the majority of stars .",
    "we set the photometric uncertainty to 0.005 which was found to best reproduce the kic stellar parameters when applied to kic stars .",
    "the adopted photometric uncertainty is close to but smaller than the quoted typical uncertainty in the kic of @xmath30 mag for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we checked if our population synthesis model can match the distribution of stellar parameters in the kic .",
    "the comparison is shown in .",
    "we see that the scp - generated stellar parameters in the synthetic catalog ( red line ) match well with that of the kic ( black line ) , which is a prerequisite to reproduce the selection function of the _ kepler _ mission . as an aside",
    ", we compared the true stellar parameters ( green line ) of the synthetic catalog with that of their scp estimates ( red line ) .",
    "we see slight differences .",
    "the scp code underestimates @xmath31}$ ] by about 0.1 dex .",
    "the gravity of giants ( @xmath32 ) is overestimated and also has significant uncertainty ( red peak at @xmath33 is broadened and shifted ) .",
    "finally , for stars hotter than 5200 k scp underestimates @xmath34 by about 300 k. this means that the kic underestimates the radii of the main sequence stars .",
    "a similar effect was also reported by @xcite while comparing the asteroseismic radii with the kic radii for a sample of subgiants and dwarfs .",
    "the underestimation of radius by kic , has important implcations for detecting planets in habitable zones around these stars .",
    "specially , this would lead to underestimation of planet radii when estimated using the transit method .",
    "however , this has no implication for the analysis of the red giant stars presented in this paper .     predicted by stellar models as a function of @xmath35 for different metallicity , mass , and evolutionary state .",
    "each row corresponds to a different mass labelled on the panels . left panels : evolution from the main sequence till the tip of the red giant branch .",

    "the near regular pattern is characterized by the so - called large frequency separation , @xmath0 , between overtone modes .",
    "the amplitude of the peaks is modulated by an envelope , which has a central frequency of maximum amplitude , @xmath6 .",
    "theory indicates that @xmath0 is related to the density of the star @xcite , while @xmath38 has been conjectured to depend upon the acoustic cut - off frequency of the atmosphere , and hence the surface gravity and the effective temperature of the star .",
    "this leads to the following approximate scaling relations : [ equ : scaling_freq1 ] & & f _",
    "( ) ^0.5 , + [ equ : scaling_freq2 ] & & f__max ( ) ^-0.5 . here ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are correction factors , which we have introduced to quantify any deviation from the scaling relations .",
    "the correction factors are degenerate with the choice of solar reference values .",
    "we fix this by adopting a consistent definition for the solar reference values . throughout the paper",
    "the solar reference values that we use are , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and are adopted from @xcite .",
    "these are the values of the sun obtained using the @xcite pipeline , which was used by @xcite .",
    "it is common practice to use such `` method - specific '' solar values , meaning the values returned from solar data when using the same method as used for the rest of the stellar sample .",
    "this practice is based on the assumption that method - specific systematic differences are the same for all stars .    by rearranging the above equations",
    ", one can estimate mass and radius of a star from the above seismic observables and effective temperature as follows : [ equ : scaling_m ] & & ( ) ^3()^-4()^1.5 + [ equ : scaling_r ] & & ( ) ( ) ^-2()^0.5 .",
    "the temperatures of most of the stars observed by _",

    "this will allow us to quantify the degree of error introduced into estimating mass and radius from @xmath43 and @xmath6 alone .",

    "red giant branch stars require a larger relative correction ( left panels , @xmath63 k ) compared to the red clump stars ( right panels ) .",
    "for the red giant branch stars , the correction factor has a strong dependence on both temperature and metallicity ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is also a dependence on mass .",

    "further corrections to asteroseismic scaling relations is certainly a possibility to resolve the discrepancy , as is a modification to the galactic model .",
    "if the scaling relations along with corrections suggested by stellar models are correct , then at least 20% of the oldest stars in _ galaxia _ have to be discarded to bring the predicted mass distributions in agreement with observations . however , altering the star formation rate as suggested above makes the color distributions disagree with observations .",
    "there are other model parameters that we have not yet explored , which can also alter the mass distribution of stars , such as , the age - scale height relation , age scale radius relation and the initial mass function .",
    "it is possible that some combination of these can explain both the photometric information of stars as well as the asteroseismic information .",
    "this should be explored in future . also , to resolve degeneracies between parameters governing the model",
    ", one would need to explore observational data from multiple sources , like , asteroseismic , photometric , spectroscopic and astrometric missions .",
    "other than _ galaxia _ , we also compared the predictions of the trilegal galactic model with the _ kepler _ data . while _",
    "galaxia _ matches the photometry of stars in the kic , trilegal could not ; it overestimated the number of blue stars .",
    "the peak in the @xmath6 distribution for trilegal was also shifted compared to the _ kepler _ observations .",
    "suppressing older stars in _ galaxia _ , also leads to overestimation of blue stars as seen in trilegal .",
    "this suggests that trilegal overestimates the occurrence of younger stars .",
    "however , trilegal matches the mass distribution of _ kepler _ red giants , provided no corrections are applied to @xmath0 .",
    "although we have been able to derive a selection function for the kepler red giant sample that seems to be representative of the population , we caution that it might have some inaccuracies given the complex selection procedure involved in the actual selection of targets .",
    "hence , it is important to verify the current findings using an independent sample of stars obeying an unambiguous selection function , such as , the red giants observed by k2 for galactic archaeology purposes , where stars have been targeted with a well defined color magnitude limits @xcite .    to conclude ,",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that the size and quality of asteroseismic data provided by _ kepler _",
    "can , in principle , provide good constraints on galactic model parameters .",
    "however , further work is required to validate the accuracy of asteroseismic scaling relation - based mass estimates for giants and to explore a wider variety of changes to the galactic model input .",
    "missions like k2 , tess , and plato are going to increase the seismic sample size by two orders of magnitude .",
    "there are also plans to get high resolution spectroscopic data for many of these stars , which will help to explore the connection between age and chemistry",
    ". such data , when combined with distances from gaia , will be invaluable for modelling the milky way and trying to understand its formation .",
