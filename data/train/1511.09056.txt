    "in dynamics , a _ rigidity theorem _ is one in which a _ weak _ equivalence between two systems implies , under a minimum set of hypotheses , a _ strong _ equivalence between those systems .",
    "for instance , a topological conjugacy ( or perhaps even a combinatorial equivalence ) between two systems may be proven in fact to be a differentiable conjugacy , provided such systems are smooth enough .    in the context of homeomorphisms of the circle , there are well - developed rigidity theories for smooth diffeomorphisms ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as for smooth circle homeomorphisms with exactly one non - degenerate critical point ( see @xcite for the real - analytic case , and @xcite for the case of @xmath1 homeos ) .",
    "by contrast , the theory for circle homeomorphisms with two or more critical points is far from being well - developed . for",
    "smooth one - dimensional systems , there is oftentimes a close relationship between rigidity and _ renormalization convergence_. the _ first renormalization _",
    "@xmath6 of a map @xmath3 around some special point in phase space ( usually a critical point ) is given by the first return map of @xmath3 to a certain neighborhood of that special point , suitably rescaled .",
    "renormalization can be seen as a ( non - linear ) operator acting on an appropriate space of such maps . in particular",
    ", some maps may be _ infinitely renormalizable _ , in the sense that the successive renomalizations @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are well - defined .",
    "it so happens that , under suitable hypotheses , if two topologically conjugate maps @xmath3 and @xmath4 are infinitely renormalizable , then the @xmath9 distance between their successive renormalizations converges to zero .",
    "when this is the case , the general _ ansatz _ is that an exponential rate of convergence should yield a smooth conjugacy between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in the presence of critical points ,",
    "say for real - analytic systems , the strategy towards rigidity usually involves ( a variation of ) the following steps .    1 .",
    "get _ real a - priori bounds _ : geometric bounds on the critical orbits .",
    "2 .   use the real bounds in ( 1 ) to promote the topological conjugacy between the two systems to a conjugacy with some mild geometric control ( such as _ quasisymmetry _ , see  [ sec : quasisym ] below ) .",
    "3 .   complexify the given real dynamical systems and use the real bounds in ( 1 ) and the geometric control in ( 2 ) in order to get _ complex a - priori bounds _ for the complexified systems .",
    "these bounds ( usually bounds on moduli of certain annuli ) yield a strong form of compactness .",
    "4 .   extend the renormalization operator to the complexified dynamical systems .",
    "use the bounds and compactness in ( 3 ) and some suitable infinite - dimensional version of schwarz s lemma to establish the desired contraction property of the underlying renormalization operator .",
    "this strategy was put forth by sullivan in @xcite and it has motivated several breakthroughs in one - dimensional dynamics , especially in the study of real - analytic unimodal maps of the interval  see the seminal works by mcmullen @xcite , lyubich @xcite , and avila - lyubich @xcite ( for the case of @xmath10 unimodal maps , see also @xcite ) .    sullivan s strategy has been completely worked out also for critical circle maps having a unique critical point ( of cubic type ) : see @xcite . for maps with two or more critical points , however , much remains to be done .",
    "only steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been established so far .",
    "step ( 1 ) follows from unpublished work by herman @xcite ( based on previous work by swiatek @xcite ) . in a recent breakthrough ,",
    "clark and van strien @xcite establish step ( 2 ) in a very general context comprising multimodal maps of the interval and critical circle homeomorphisms with several ( non - flat ) critical points  henceforth called _ multicritical circle maps_. their proof is deep and rather involved , and it uses complex - analytic tools .",
    "they are primarily interested in the interval multimodal case , which is much more difficult than the multicritical circle case even at the topological or combinatorial level .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to establish step ( 2 ) for multicritical circle maps using _ purely real - variable techniques_. this main result can be stated as follows .",
    "a[maintheorem ] let @xmath11 be two @xmath10 ( @xmath12 ) multicritical circle maps with the same irrational rotation number and the same number of ( non - flat ) critical points , and let @xmath2 be homeomorphism conjugating @xmath3 to @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ such that @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath5 maps each critical point of @xmath3 to a corresponding critical point of @xmath4 , then @xmath5 is quasisymmetric .    unlike @xcite , where all critical points are assumed to be of integral power - law type , here",
    "it is not assumed that the critical exponents are integers .",
    "non - integral power laws are relevant , as they come about naturally _",
    "e.g. _ in the study of certain one - dimensional maps arising as return maps to cross - sections of the lorenz flow @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] will be given in ",
    "[ secmainthm ] . along the way",
    ", we will re - establish the real bounds , _",
    "i.e. _ step ( 1 ) , imitating the approach used in @xcite .",
    "we stress that , in the case of circle maps having a _ single _ ( non - flat ) critical point , theorem [ maintheorem ] is due to yoccoz ( see the unplublished manuscript @xcite , or @xcite for a published account ) .",
    "we remark that the existence of a homeomorphism @xmath5 conjugating @xmath3 and @xmath4 as above is a well - known theorem also due to yoccoz @xcite : indeed , every multicritical circle map without periodic points is topologically conjugate to an irrational rotation ( in particular , such a multicritical circle map is uniquely ergodic ) .",
    "however , there is no reason why a conjugacy @xmath5 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 should map critical points of @xmath3 to critical points of @xmath4 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the unique borel probability measures invariant under @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath16 be the critical points of @xmath3 , and @xmath17 be the critical points of @xmath4 ; both sets of critical points are assumed to be cyclically ordered ( say counterclockwisely ) . then a homeomorphism @xmath5 conjugating @xmath3 to @xmath4 and satisfying @xmath18 for all @xmath19 exists if and only if @xmath20=\\mu_g[c_{i-1}(g),c_i(g)]$ ] for all for all @xmath21 .",
    "the proof is straightforward . for more on the ergodic theory of multicritical circle maps ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "still within the realm of circle maps , other interesting ( partial ) rigidity results have been obtained .",
    "for instance , in a recent paper @xcite , palmisano proved that @xmath22 weakly order - preserving circle maps with a flat interval are quasi - symmetrically rigid in their non - wandering sets , provided their rotation number is of bounded type and a certain bounded geometry hypothesis is satisfied .",
    "in  [ prelim ] , we introduce the basic concepts and well - known results to be used in the rest of the paper , including the cross - ratio distortion tools which are so ubiquitous in one - dimensional dynamics . in  [ sec : realbounds ] , we establish _ real a - priori bounds _ for multicritical circle maps .",
    "these bounds show that the dynamical partitions of a multicritical circle map have bounded geometry .",
    "the result , in slightly different form , is known from unpublished notes by herman @xcite , based on previous work by swiatek @xcite , and a nice exposition of herman s approach is given by petersen @xcite ( see also the translation of herman s notes by chritat ) .",
    "nevertheless , we provide a different proof , based on the one given for unicritical circle maps by de faria and de melo in @xcite .",
    "the original contribution of the present paper starts in  [ sec : geom ] .",
    "there , we prove two crucial lemmas about the dynamical partitions of a multicritical circle map .",
    "the first lemma states that , if two atoms belonging to the level @xmath23 dynamical partitions associated to two distinct critical points intersect , then they must have comparable lenghts .",
    "the second states that , if an atom belonging to a dynamical partition ( at a certain level @xmath23 ) contains critical points of the appropriate ( level @xmath23 ) return map , then it must be relatively large ( _ i.e. , _ it must be comparable to the atom of the partition at the previous level that contains it ) .",
    "these two key facts are used to build a sequence of auxiliary partitions which are intermediate refinements of the dynamical partitions of a ( chosen ) critical point of the original map . in ",
    "[ secmainthm ] , this sequence of auxiliary partitions is used to build a _ fine grid _ ( as originally defined in @xcite ) . in the same section , we prove a criterion for a conjugacy between two given multicritical circle maps to be quasisymmetric : if such conjugacy yields an isomorphism between the fine grids of both maps , then it is quasisymmetric . from this criterion ( stated but not proved in @xcite ) and the fine grid construction ,",
    "our theorem [ maintheorem ] easily follows . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : final ] , we state a conjecture concerning the smooth rigidity of multicritical circle maps which is naturally inspired by what happens in the unicritical case .      in this paper , we require our circle maps to be at least @xmath1-smooth . the expert reader will certainly be familiar with the fact that the cross - ratio distortion tools we use , and consequently the real bounds we prove in  [ sec : realbounds ] , are valid in more generality .",
    "indeed , for such purposes it suffices to assume that such a map @xmath3 is @xmath24 ( with non - flat critical points ) and that @xmath25 satisfies a zygmund condition ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch iv ,  2 ) ) .",
    "however , in order to build the fine grid mentioned above , and control its geometry , we make fundamental use of the so - called _ yoccoz lemma _ ( see lemma [ lemyoccoz ] ) .",
    "this lemma requires a negative schwarzian condition , and therefore the @xmath1 hypothesis is , under current technology , unavoidable .",
    "in this section we present the basic definitions and basic ( well - known ) results to be used throughout . for the facts presented here , plus general background on one - dimensional dynamics and much more , the reader should consult @xcite .      for us , the _ unit circle _",
    "is the affine one - manifold @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamical systems we are interested in are _ orientation - preserving homeomorphisms _ of the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath27 be such a homeomorphism .",
    "it is well - known since poincar that the relative order of the points @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) making up the full - orbit of @xmath30 under @xmath3 on the circle is independent of the point @xmath30 .",
    "if we count the average number of times that the finite piece of orbit @xmath31 winds around @xmath32 and let @xmath33 , we get a limiting number which is also independent of @xmath30 , and is called the _ rotation number _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the rotation number is a _ topological invariant _ , in the sense that any two topologically conjugate circle homeomorphisms always have the same rotation number ( this is true even if the homeomorphisms are merely topologically semi - conjugate , we say that @xmath3 is _ topologically semi - conjugate _ to @xmath4 if there exists a continuous map @xmath2 such that @xmath13 . ] ) .",
    "as it happens , every orientation - preserving homeomorphism of the unit circle is topologically semi - conjugate to a rotation .    given a homeomorphism @xmath3 as above , let @xmath34 be the rotation number of @xmath3 , and consider its continued fraction expansion @xmath35=",
    "\\cfrac{1}{a_{0}+\\cfrac{1}{a_{1}+\\cfrac{1 } { \\ddots } } } \\ , \\ ] ] which is finite or infinite according to whether @xmath34 is rational or irrational , respectively .",
    "we are only interested in the irrational case , which corresponds to homeomorphisms without periodic orbits . under this hypothesis",
    ", we may recursively define an infinite sequence of _ return times _ associated to @xmath34 by @xmath36 these numbers are precisely the denominators of the reduced fractions obtained by truncating the continued fraction expansion of @xmath34 at the @xmath37 level , that is to say @xmath38=           \\cfrac{1}{a_{0}+\\cfrac{1}{a_{1}+\\cfrac{1 } {   \\ddots \\cfrac{1}{a_{n-1 } } } } } \\ ] ] these return times are characterized by the following property : for any @xmath39 , the closed interval @xmath40 with endpoints @xmath30 and @xmath41 containing the point @xmath42 contains no other iterate @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath3 is a rigid rotation ( by an angle which is an irrational multiple of @xmath45 ) , the sequence @xmath46 is such that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 ; for this reason , the return times @xmath49 are also called _ closest return times _ , and the points @xmath50 are the _ closest returns _ of the orbit of @xmath51 to @xmath30 .",
    "these returns alternate around @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. , _ we have either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , in the natural order on @xmath32 induced from @xmath54 .",
    "the most basic combinatorial fact about a circle homeomorphism @xmath3 ( topologically conjugate to an irrational rotation ) to be used throughout is the following .",
    "for each @xmath48 and each @xmath51 , the collection of intervals @xmath55 is a _ partition of the unit circle ( modulo endpoints ) _ , called the _",
    "@xmath23-th dynamical partition _ associated to the point @xmath30 .",

    "short_. for each @xmath23 , the partition @xmath58 is a ( non - strict ) refinement of @xmath59 .      in this paper",
    "we study homeomorphisms of the circle of a very special kind , namely _ multicritical circle maps_. here is the formal definition .",
    "[ def : multicritic ] a multicritical circle map is an orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath60 of class @xmath61 , @xmath12 , having finitely many critical points @xmath62 satisfying the following .",

    "the proof follows directly from property ( 2 ) in the above definition .",
    "we remark _ en passant _ that each @xmath78 is called the _ criticality _ or",
    "_ power - law type _ of the corresponding critical point @xmath79 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , a well - known theorem due to yoccoz @xcite states that every multicritical circle map without periodic points is topologically conjugate to an irrational rotation .",
    "this basic fact will be used throughout .",
    "there are several types of cross - ratios used in one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "we describe here two of the most ubiquitous ( but shall use only one of them ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath80 either the unit circle @xmath32 or the real line @xmath54 .",
    "given two intervals @xmath81 with @xmath82 compactly contained in @xmath83 , let us denote by @xmath84 and @xmath85 the two connected components of @xmath86 .",
    "we define the @xmath87-cross - ratio and the @xmath88 cross - ratio of the pair @xmath89 , respectively , as follows : @xmath90 one easily checks that @xmath91 .",
    "both cross - ratios are preserved by moebius transformations ; the latter is weakly contracted by maps with negative schwarzian derivative ( see below ) , whereas the former is weakly expanded .    unlike @xcite , where the @xmath87-cross - ratio was used throughout , in the present paper it will be more convenient to use the @xmath88-cross - ratio .",
    "the latter has the advantage that its logarithm is given by the _ poincar length _ of @xmath82 inside @xmath83 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the _ poincar density _ of @xmath94 $ ] , given by @xmath95      the main tool used in this paper is _ cross - ratio distortion_. let @xmath96 be a continuous map , and let @xmath97 be an open set such that @xmath98 is a homeomorphism onto its image .",

    "also , when @xmath102 is a diffeomorphism onto its image and @xmath104 has _ bounded variation _ in @xmath83 , then an easy calculation using the mean value theorem shows that @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
