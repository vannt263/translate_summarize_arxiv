    "in this note , we expand our chain model of the little discs operad which we gave in terms of spineless cacti to a chain model for the framed little discs operad in terms of normalized cacti . extending the philosophy of @xcite",
    ", we then show that the chain model for the framed little discs operad naturally acts on the normalized hochschild cochains of a unital associative algebra with a non  degenerate , symmetric , invariant bi  linear pairing .",
    "in fact , as in @xcite , this operation can again be seen as a discretization of the calculations for the relations of a bv algebra up to homotopy on the chains of the operad @xmath1 of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is proven , that the operad of framed little discs is equivalent to the operad of cacti .",
    "moreover , we gave a description of cacti in terms of a bi  crossed product of spineless cacti and an operad built on the monoid @xmath2 which we showed to be homotopy equivalent to the semi  direct product of these operads @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we gave a chain model for spineless cacti in terms of normalized spineless cacti which we showed to give a natural solution to deligne s conjecture @xcite .",
    "using the description in terms of the bi  crossed and semi  direct products , we obtain a chain model for the operad of framed little discs , by tensoring the chains of normalized spineless cacti with the chains for the operad built on the monoid @xmath2 . in order to prove the necessary relations on the chain level",
    "one can translate the respective relations from the relations in the @xmath1 operad using the method described in @xcite . as it turns out , in order to translate the relations and thus to establish the homotopy bv structure on the chain level",
    ", one needs a refinement of the cell decomposition on the semi - direct product to be able to accommodate all the operations which were used in the @xmath1 operad picture . this refinement uses cell decompositions on the @xmath2 factors which are induced by regarding them as the lobe they represent .",
    "this leads to a combinatorial description in terms of planar planted black and white ( b / w ) bipartite trees with additional data called spines . in the language of cacti @xcite ,",
    "the additional data keeps track of the position of the local zeros . on these trees , there are linear orders at each vertex , which may differ from the induced linear order of the planar planted trees .",
    "this forces us to look at non  rooted trees or equivalently to invert the orientation of edges . according to the general calculus for `` correlation functions '' defined by trees , to achieve such an inversion one needs to have a non  degenerate pairing , which is symmetric and invariant",
    "this is the assumption we have to make on our algebra . with this assumption",
    ", we can rewrite the action of the cellular chains as `` operadic correlation functions '' for decorated trees . in this description",
    "the operation of the chains of the framed little discs operad becomes apparent .",
    "the results and techniques we present below can also be employed in other situations , which we comment on at the end of the paper .",
    "notably one can use it to obtain an action of cells of a ribbon graph cell decomposition of moduli space on cyclic complexes .",
    "this should ultimately lead to string topology like operations of the cells of moduli space of decorated bordered surfaces on the free loop space of a compact manifold extending the operations of the string prop or dioperad .",
    "the basic constructions for this are announced below .",

    "in this section , we formally introduce the graphs and the operations on graphs which we will use in our analysis of cacti .",
    "this is the approach as given in appendix b of @xcite in which cacti are characterized as a certain type of ribbon graph .",

    "we call @xmath7 the vertices of @xmath3 and @xmath8 the flags of @xmath3 . the edges @xmath9 of @xmath3 are the orbits of the flags under the involution @xmath5 .",
    "a directed edge is an edge together with an order of the two flags which define it . in case",
    "there is no risk of confusion , we will drop the subscripts @xmath3 .",
    "notice that @xmath10 gives a bijection between flags and directed edges .",

    "we also let @xmath15 and call these edges the edges incident to @xmath12 .",
    "the geometric realization of a graph is given by considering each flag as a half - edge and gluing the half - edges together using the involution @xmath16 .",
    "this yields a one - dimensional cw complex whose realization we call the realization of the graph .",
    "a graph is connected if its realization is .",
    "a graph is a tree if it is connected and its realization is contractible .",
    "a rooted tree is a pair @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a tree and @xmath19 is a distinguished vertex . in a rooted tree",
    "there is a natural orientation for edges , in which the edge points toward the root .",
    "that is we say @xmath20 is naturally oriented if @xmath21 is on the unique shortest path from @xmath22 to the root .",
    "this means that the set @xmath23 splits up into incoming and outgoing edges .",
    "given a vertex @xmath12 , we let @xmath24 be the number of incoming edges and call it the arity of @xmath12 . a vertex @xmath12 is called a leaf if @xmath25 . notice that the root is the only vertex for which @xmath26 .",
    "for all other vertices @xmath27 one has @xmath28 .",
    "a bi - colored or black and white ( b / w ) tree is a tree @xmath18 together with a map @xmath29 .",
    "such a tree is called bipartite if for all @xmath30 , that is edges are only between black and white vertices .",
    "we call the set @xmath31 the white vertices . if @xmath20 is a naturally oriented edge , we call the edge white if @xmath32 and denote the set of white edges by @xmath33",

    "the edges incident to the tails are called tail edges and are denoted @xmath37 . for tails , we will only consider those flags of the tail edges which are not incident to the tail vertices and call them @xmath38 .",

    "a graph with a cyclic order of the flags at each vertex gives rise to bijections @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the next flag in the cyclic order . since @xmath41 one obtains a map @xmath42 .",

    "go along this half - edge starting from the vertex @xmath22 , continue along the second half - edge @xmath45 until you reach the vertex @xmath21 then continue starting along the flag @xmath46 and repeat .",
    "a tree with a cyclic order of the flags at each vertex is called planar .",
    "a planar tree has only one cycle @xmath47 .",
    "a planted planar tree is a rooted planar tree @xmath17 together with a linear order of the set of flags at @xmath48 .",
    "such a tree has a linear order of all flags as follows : let @xmath44 be the smallest element of @xmath49 , then every flag appears in @xmath47 and defining the flag @xmath44 to be the smallest gives a linear order on the set of all flags .",
    "this linear order induces a linear order on all oriented edges and on all un - oriented edges , by restricting to the edges in the orientation opposite the natural orientation i.e.  pointing away from the root .",
    "we denote the latter by @xmath50 and its restriction to @xmath23 or @xmath51 by @xmath52 .",
    "we will equivalently consider planar planted trees as defined above or as a rooted planar trees whose root vertex has valence one .",
    "the bijection in one direction is given by adding a new root vertex and one new edge such that the induced linear structure on the old root is the given one .",
    "this tree is called the realization of the planar planted tree . in the other direction",
    "the bijection is simply given by contracting the unique edge incident to the root , but retaining the linear order .",
    "in the realization of a planar planted tree , we call the unique edge incident to the ( new ) root @xmath53 the root edge and denote it by @xmath54 and set @xmath55 to be the flag of the root edge which is not incident to the root . also @xmath56 .",

    "each edge is traversed by the cycle @xmath47 .",

    "this graph is a tree and is b / w and bipartite by construction .",
    "it is also planar , since the @xmath74 and the sets @xmath51 have a cyclic order and therefore also @xmath83 .",
    "it is furthermore rooted by declaring @xmath84 to be the root vertex and declaring @xmath85 to be the smallest element makes it into a planted tree .",

    "called @xmath1 operad to ribbon graphs with marked points on the cycles of the graph . in the case of no punctures",
