    "landau symmetry breaking paradigm has been successful in explaining many observed phenomena from ferromagnets to superconductors  @xcite , exploiting notions such as long - range order and off - diagonal long - range order  @xcite .",
    "such phases can be characterized by local order parameters , associated with certain symmetry and its breaking .",
    "however , it was recognized that systems such as fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite and quantum spin liquids  @xcite can not be described by local order parameters and they exhibit what we call topological orders ( to )  @xcite .",
    "classifying and characterizing them is an important task in understanding possible phases of matter in condensed matter physics , a pursuit no less fundamental than characterizing the periodic table of atoms .",
    "topological orders  @xcite , emergent phenomena usually in two spatial dimensions , appear in gapped systems displaying ( i ) ground - state degeneracy on multiconnected topology , ( ii ) local indistinguishability of degenerate ground states , ( iii ) fractional statistics of excitations , and ( iv ) the so - called long - range entanglement .",
    "topological orders have also been much explored in the context of topological quantum computation , as properties such as ( ii ) and ( iii ) , can give rise to natural protection and robust processing of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "much progress has since been made in understanding these more quantitatively .",
    "for example , the long - range entanglement  @xcite in topological orders can be quantified by the so - called topological entanglement  @xcite , which is a deficit to the entanglement area law  @xcite .",
    "the fractional statistics of excitations can be quantified by the so - called modular matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are the ( generically ) non - abelian geometric phases of the degenerate ground states on the two - dimensional torus  @xcite .",
    "they can be obtained via the wavefunction overlaps  @xcite , conveniently using the basis of the so - called minimally entropy states or minimally entangled states ( mes )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above intrinsic topological orders , recently it was found that symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) order can emerge if the ground state ( which is unique ) does not break global symmetry of the hamiltonian , also in contrast to the spontaneous symmetry - breaking landau paradigm . however , their excitations do not have fractional statistics in the bulk .",
    "topological insulators and superconductors are such an prominent example  @xcite .",
    "spt phases have topological order that is not characterized by a local order parameter either , but their existence requires symmetry to be preserved  @xcite .",
    "ground states of non - trivial spt phases can not be continuously connected to trivial product states without either closing the gap or breaking the protecting symmetry .",
    "even though there is a unique ground state in the bulk , for the open boundary condition , there are gapless excitations or nontrivial surface states at the boundary .    in one dimension",
    ", the classification of spt phases has been understood extensively  @xcite and is considered complete  @xcite .",
    "the characterization there can be obtained via the inequivalent projective representations corresponding to the on - site symmetry . in higher dimensions @xmath4",
    "the use of @xmath5-th group cohomology gives rise to systematic construction of large classes of interacting bosonic spt phases  @xcite .",
    "in addition to cohomology , there have been alternative understanding of these spt phases . in 2d , it was argued that any spt phase characterized by third group cohomology @xmath6 $ ] is dual to a gauge theory of a finite group @xmath7  @xcite . through this duality , it is possible to characterize 2d spt phases using topological invariants such as modular @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices and combinations of them  @xcite .",
    "in addition to cohomology and gauging , the classification of spt phases can actually be understood via other approaches , such as ( 1 ) anomalous symmetry action at the boundary  @xcite , ( 2 ) the nonlinear sigma model with a topological theta term  @xcite , and ( 3 ) gauge fields for symmetry twists  @xcite , and ( 4 ) cobordism  @xcite , possibly leading to spt phases beyond cohomology  @xcite .",
    "given a hamiltonian , how do we know whether there are any intrinsic or symmetry - protected topological orders in the phase diagram and how to detect them ? detecting and identifying these topological orders is also of practical importance as the classification only tells us what phases are possible in principle .",
    "this is a challenging task in general . for intrinsic to ,",
    "methods such as exact diagonalization  @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations  @xcite and tensor networks  @xcite have been applied to extract the topological entanglement , mes , and modular matrices . for spt phases ,",
    "much success has been limited to one dimension  @xcite .",
    "recently , the so - called strange correlator ( sc )  @xcite has been proposed by xu and collaborators and used to detect nontrivial spt phases in both one  @xcite and two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "using the so - called momentum polarization ( mp ) originally developed for toplogical order  @xcite , zaletel recently proposed to use ( i ) the statistical spin @xmath8 of the @xmath9-charge and @xmath9-flux composite , where @xmath9 is an element in an abelian group @xmath7 and ( ii ) the projective representation for a @xmath9-flux as a characterization for 2d spt phases with an abelian symmetry group  @xcite .    here",
    "we employ tensor - network ( tn ) methods  @xcite to obtain the topological invariants , i.e. , the modular matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 for detecting and identifying 2d topological orders , both intrinsic and symmetry - protected ones .",
    "it was previously shown by he , moradi and wen  @xcite how to do this for topological phases via wavefunction overlaps  @xcite .",
    "our main contribution here is to show and demonstrate how @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be obtained for 2d spt phases , based on a theoretical proposal by hung and wen  @xcite .",
    "we also find that @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be used to characterize symmetry - breaking phases as well , which have been studied recently using tensor - network methods on infinite cylinders  @xcite .",
    "for convenience we shall refer to our method as the tensor - network scheme for modular @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices ( tnst ) . as will be demonstrated below",
    ", our tnst scheme also applies to topological order .",
    "therefore , modular matrices provide a potential unifying picture and tool for detecting and characterizing gapped phases",
    ". a full - fledge application would involve ( i ) solving the hamiltonian and obtaining the ground state wavefunction(s )  @xcite , ( ii ) identifying the symmetry and the associated matrix - product operator ( mpo )  @xcite , and then ( iii ) employing our approach here to obtain the modular matrices . to demonstrate the applicability of our method ,",
    "we shall test it on a few families of wavefunctions that are either topologically ordered or symmetric under certain group action ( whose parent hamiltonians can be constructed in principle ; see appendices  [ sec : firstz2 ] and  [ sec : secondz2 ] for two families of @xmath10 spt hamiltonians ) , bypassing the step of obtaining the unknown ground - state wavefunction from a given hamiltonian and the associated mpo s .",
    "classification of spt phases  @xcite was facilitated by the use of the tn states , also known as projected entangled pair states ( peps ) or tensor - product states ( tps )  @xcite , which were motivated from generalization of the dmrg invented by white  @xcite to higher dimensions .",
    "they can be regarded as variational wavefunctions .",
    "the matrix product states ( mps ) in 1d turns out to be the form of wavefunction that the dmrg algorithm converges to  @xcite .",
    "the tn states have also been shown to exactly represent a large class of topological states , including both nonchiral  @xcite and chiral  @xcite topological order .",
    "the evaluation of observables with mps is efficient , whereas that with tn states in two or higher dimensions is a hard problem for exact contraction .",
    "but approximation schemes have been developed so that accuracy can be improved by increasing the size of tensors  @xcite , with schemes including very recent development of powerful methods such as the tensor network renormalization ( tnr )  @xcite .",
    "the specific scheme that we shall adopt for evaluating modular matrices via wavefunction overlaps is the so - called higher order tensor renormalization group ( hotrg ) developed by xiang and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "but other contraction schemes can be used as well .    even though the models that we study in this paper are not realized by any natural materials , they are useful for advancing our understanding of how to develop theoretical and numerical tools for probing their topological properties and provide a direct comparison of our numerical results with theoretical analysis . on the other hand , these models may be engineered in the laboratory .",
    "materials have been discovered , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 for realizing haldane chains  @xcite ( which is an exemplary spt phase ) and frustrated magnets such as herbertsmithite for realizing spin liquid  @xcite , and these systems are well approximated by lattice or spin hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , recent rapid development in quantum simulations using cold atoms , rydberg atoms , trapped ions , cavities , photonics , and superconducting qubits , etc . have been proposed and developed to emulate lattice hamiltonians , and possible exotic hamiltonians ( such as intrinsic and symmetry - protected topological orders ) not necessarily existing naturally  @xcite .",
