    "it is well known that both einstein s theories are based on the fact that light propagates at a constant velocity",
    ". however , the universe also expands at a constant rate when gravity is negligible .",
    "moreover , cosmologists usually measure spatial distances and redshifts of faraway galaxies as expressed by the hubble expansion . in recent years",
    "this fact was undertaken to develop new theories in terms of distances and velocities ( redshift ) .",
    "while in einstein s special relativity the propagation of light plays the major role , in the new theory it is the expansion of the universe that takes that role .",
    "it is the concept of cosmic time that becomes crucial in these recent theories . in the standard theory the cosmic time",
    "is considered to be absolute .",
    "thus we talk about the big bang time with respect to us here on earth as an absolute quantity .",
    "consider , for example , another galaxy that has , let us say , a relative cosmic time with respect to us of 1 billion year .",
    "now one may ask what will be the big bang time with respect to this galaxy . will it be the big bang time with respect to us minus 1 billion year ?",
    "a person who lives in that galaxy will look at our galaxy and say that ours is far away from him by also 1 billion year .",
    "will that mean , with respect to him , our galaxy is closer to the big bang time by 1 billion year ? or will we seem to him to be farther by 1 billion year ?",
    "all this leads to the conclusion that there is no absolute cosmic time .",
    "rather , it is a relative concept .",
    "based on this assumption , we present in this lecture a theory that relates distances between galaxies and their relative velocities .",
    "these are actually the dynamical variables that astronomers measure . in the first part",
    "the theory will be relating distances to velocities with very weak gravitational field ( special relativity ) .",
    "we then , in the second part , extend the theory to include the gravitational field of the universe . before doing that",

    "line element of an expanding universe with negligible gravity : @xmath14 it is equal to zero for the hubble expansion but is not vanishing at cosmic times smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "notice the similarity to minkowskian line element @xmath15 which vanishes for light propagation but is different from zero for particles of finite mass.5 .",
    "postulates of cosmological special relativity : ( 1 ) the laws of physics are valid at all cosmic times ; ( 2 ) @xmath13 has the same value at all cosmic times .",
    "( similarly to einstein s special relativity postulates.)6 . the cosmological transformation .",
    "this is the analog to the lorentz transformation .",
    "it relates physical quantities at different cosmic times ( similarly to the lorentz transformation that relates quantities at different velocities ) : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath10 at the big bang , @xmath19 , now.7 .",
    "example : denote the temperature of the universe at a cosmic time @xmath20 by @xmath21 and that at present by @xmath22 ( = 2.73k ) , we then have @xmath23 at @xmath24 we get @xmath25k .",
    "( this result assumes negligible gravity and needs a correction by a factor of 13 , and thus the temperature at @xmath24 is 41k.)8 . the galaxy cone .",

    "@xmath20 : @xmath29 the volume of the universe is inversely proportional to its density , hence the ratio of the volumes at two backward cosmic times @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath32 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 very close to @xmath13 we have @xmath33 where primes indicate times with respect to the big bang . for @xmath34s , and @xmath35",
    "much less than 1s , we have @xmath36 for example , at @xmath37s , we obtain @xmath38 describing inflation .    the above introduction gives a brief review of a new special relativity ( cosmological special relativity , for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "obviously the universe is filled up with gravity and therefore one has to go to a riemannian space with the einstein gravitational field equations in terms of space and redshift ( velocity ) .",
    "this is done in the second part of these lectures . before that we outline einstein s general relativity theory .",
    "\\1 . postulates : ( a ) principle of general covariance ; ( b ) principle of equivalence.2 .",

    "the metric tensor @xmath39 as the gravitational potential @xcite.3 . the einstein field equations : @xmath40 4 . the geodesic equation as the equation of motion : @xmath41",
    "the theory presented here , cosmological general relativity , uses a riemannian four - dimensional presentation of gravitation in which the coordinates are those of hubble , i.e. distances and velocity rather than the traditional space and time .",
    "we solve the field equations and show that there are three possibilities for the universe to expand .",
    "the theory describes the universe as having a three - phase evolution with a decelerating expansion , followed by a constant and an accelerating expansion , and it predicts that the universe is now in the latter phase . it is shown , assuming @xmath42 , that the time at which the universe goes over from a decelerating to an accelerating expansion , i.e. , the constant - expansion phase , occurs at 8.5 gyr ago .",
    "also , at that time the cosmic radiation temperature was 146k .",
    "recent observations of distant supernovae imply that the universe s growth is accelerating , contrary to what has always been assumed , that the expansion is slowing down due to gravity .",
    "our theory confirms these recent experimental results by showing that the universe now is definitely in a stage of accelerating expansion .",
    "the theory predicts also that now there is a positive pressure , @xmath43 , in the universe .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the theory has no cosmological constant .",
    "it is also shown that the three - dimensional space of the universe is euclidean , as the boomerang , maxima , dasi and cbi microwave telescopes have shown .",
    "comparison with general relativity theory is finally made and it is pointed out that the classical experiments as well as the gravitational radiation prediction follow from the present theory , too .",
    "in the framework of cosmological general relativity ( cgr ) gravitation is described by a curved four - dimensional riemannian spacevelocity .",
    "cgr incorporates the bb constant @xmath13 at the outset .",
    "the hubble law is assumed in cgr as a fundamental law .",
    "cgr , in essence , extends hubble s law so as to incorporate gravitation in it ; it is actually a _ distribution theory _ that relates distances and velocities between galaxies .",
    "the theory involves measured quantities and it takes a picture of the universe as it is at any moment .",
    "the following is a brief review of cgr as was originally given by the author in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the foundations of any gravitational theory are based on the principles of equivalence and general covariance .",
    "these two principles lead immediately to the realization that gravitation should be described by a four - dimensional curved spacetime , in our theory spacevelocity , and that the field equations and the equations of motion should be generally covariant .",
    "hence these principles were adopted in cgr also .",
    "use is made in a four - dimensional riemannian manifold with a metric @xmath39 and a line element @xmath44 .",
    "the difference from einstein s general relativity is that our coordinates are : @xmath45 is a velocitylike coordinate ( rather than a timelike coordinate ) , thus @xmath46 where @xmath13 is the big bang time and @xmath1 the velocity .",
    "the coordinate @xmath46 is the comparable to @xmath47 in ordinary general relativity .",
    "the other three coordinates @xmath48 , @xmath49 , are spacelike , just as in general relativity theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above choice of coordinates is that the null condition @xmath50 describes the expansion of the universe in the curved spacevelocity ( generalized hubble s law with gravitation ) as compared to the propagation of light in the curved spacetime in general relativity .",
    "this means one solves the field equations ( to be given in the sequel ) for the metric tensor , then from the null condition @xmath50 one obtains immedialety the dependence of the relative distances between the galaxies on their relative velocities .    as usual in gravitational theories , one equates geometry to physics .",
    "the first is expressed by means of the einstein tensor .",
    "the physical part is expressed by the energy - momentum tensor which now has a different physical meaning from that in einstein s theory .",
    "more important , the coupling constant that relates geometry to physics is now also _",
    "different_.    accordingly the field equations are @xmath51 exactly as in einstein s theory , with @xmath52 given by @xmath53 , ( in general relativity it is given by @xmath54 ) , where @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath13 the big bang constant time .",
    "when the equations of motion are written in terms of velocity instead of time , the constant @xmath55 will replace @xmath57 . using the above equations one then has @xmath58 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath59 is constructed , along the lines of general relativity theory , with the speed of light being replaced by @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath28 is the average mass density of the universe , then it will be assumed that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the four - velocity . in general relativity theory",
    "one takes @xmath62 . in newtonian gravity",
    "one has the poisson equation @xmath63 . at points",
    "where @xmath64 one solves the vacuum einstein field equations in general relativity and the laplace equation @xmath65 in newtonian gravity . in both theories",
    "a null ( zero ) solution is allowed as a trivial case . in cosmology",
    ", however , there exists no situation at which @xmath28 can be zero because the universe is filled with matter . in order to be able to have zero on the right - hand side of ( 6.1 ) one takes @xmath66 not as equal to @xmath28 , but to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the critical mass density , a _",
    "constant _ in cgr given by @xmath69 , whose value is @xmath70 , a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter .",
    "accordingly one takes @xmath71 ; @xmath67 for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "moreover , the above choice of the energy - momentum tensor is the only possibility that yields a constant expansion when @xmath72 as it should be .",
