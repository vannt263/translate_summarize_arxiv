    "thermodynamic and structural properties of square - well ( sw ) fluids have been profusely studied both from theory and from computer simulation @xcite@xcite . from the theoretical side , the first few virial coefficients have been obtained @xcite and the radial distribution function has been evaluated from numerical solutions of integral equation theories , such as percus  yevick @xcite , yvon  born  green @xcite , hnc @xcite , msa @xcite , rogers ",
    "young @xcite , orpa @xcite , and hrt @xcite .",
    "simpler analytical approximations have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties have been derived from the theoretical structure functions as well as from perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "access to the `` experimental '' properties of sw fluids has been made possible via molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "special attention has received the determination of the critical point of sw fluids @xcite , both from the theoretical and simulational viewpoints .",
    "the main reason for this wide interest lies in the fact that a sw fluid is perhaps the simplest one whose particles have attractive as well as repulsive interactions . in general , theories are easier to apply to sw fluids than to other fluids with more realistic potentials . in addition , the sw potential seems to be particularly sensitive to the performance of a theory .",
    "therefore , this kind of fluid is an excellent testing - ground for many theories of fluids and so the study of sw fluids can be considered as a first step towards our understanding of the properties of fluids with more sophisticated interactions .",
    "there is an additional reason explaining the recent revival of interest in sw fluids .",
    "the sw potential possesses , besides the diameter of the hard core and the depth of the well , an additional parameter measuring the width of the well .",
    "this makes the sw potential with a small width especially suited to model the effective interactions among colloidal particles @xcite . in this context",
    ", the glass transition @xcite and a solid - to - solid isostructural transition @xcite have been studied for narrow sw systems .    despite the extensive number of studies devoted to the sw fluid",
    ", relatively little attention has been paid to several thermodynamic properties .",
    "this is the case for the heat capacity . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there are available @xcite only a few simulation data of this property for sw fluids .",
    "theoretical calculations of the same quantity are equally scarce @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations of the constant - volume excess heat capacity @xmath0 of sw fluids for several values of the potential width and , for each of them , for several densities and temperatures . moreover , in order to put clear the sensitivity of this property to the accuracy of a theory , the simulation data are compared with the results obtained from the barker  henderson ( bh ) @xcite perturbation theory and with those derived from the theoretical model proposed by yuste and santos @xcite , recently simplified by acedo and santos @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the theoretical foundations of the mc procedure used and we describe the simulations performed and the results obtained . in section [ sec3 ] , we present an outline of the above - mentioned theories . finally , in the last section the theoretical results are compared with simulation data and discussed .",
    "in a square - well ( sw ) fluid , particles interact by means of a potential of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the potential width in units of the particle diameter @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the potential depth .",
    "constant - volume averaged excess heat capacity per particle in a sw fluid can be expressed in the form @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of particles , @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is the reduced temperature , and @xmath9 is the number of pairs of interacting particles , that is , the number of pairs of particles whose centers lie separated by a reduced distance @xmath10 .",
    "the averages involved in equation ( [ eq : cve ] ) can be calculated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the nvt ensemble .",
    "therefore , we have proceeded to calculate by means of mc nvt the constant - volume averaged excess heat capacity per particle for sw fluids with well widths @xmath2 ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . for each value of @xmath2 , @xmath0 has been evaluated for several densities along isotherms . to this end ,",
    "a system consisting of @xmath13 particles placed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions was used .",
    "particles were initially placed in a regular configuration and then the system was allowed to equilibrate for @xmath14 cycles , each of them consisting of an attempt move per particle , the first @xmath15 cycles at a very high temperature and the remaining ones at the desired temperature .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 was performed by averaging over the next @xmath16 cycles , performing partial averages every @xmath15 cycles with the aim of estimating the statistical error from the standard deviation .",
    "the use of such a huge number of cycles in the calculations was motivated by the need of ensuring that the values of @xmath0 converged to a constant value , apart from statistical fluctuations .",
    "in fact , we realized that for low values of the number of cycles used in the calculations , the values of @xmath0 increase with the number of cycles used .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table - cve ] . we have considered four isotherms for @xmath17 and three isotherms for @xmath18 .",
    "the lowest temperature in each case is larger than the estimated critical temperature @xcite : @xmath19 for @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "in the second - order barker  henderson perturbation theory @xcite , the free energy is expressed in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free energy of the hard - sphere ( hs ) reference system and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the first- and second - order perturbative terms , respectively . according to this theory , the constant - volume excess heat capacity per particle is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 ^ 2g_0\\left ( r \\right)r^2dr } \\label{eq : f2mc}\\ ] ] in the so - called _ macroscopic compressibility approximation _ , whereas @xmath27 ^ 2\\left\\ { { { { \\partial \\left [ { \\rho g_0\\left ( r \\right ) } \\right ] } \\over { \\partial p } } } \\right\\}_0r^2dr}\\label{eq : f2lc}\\ ] ] in the so - called _ local compressibility approximation_. in eqs.([eq : f2mc ] ) and ( [ eq : f2lc ] ) , @xmath28 is the number density , @xmath29 is the perturbative contribution to the potential function , which in a sw potential is @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the pressure , and @xmath33 is the radial distribution function ( r.d.f . ) of the hard - sphere reference fluid .    in recent years , several analytical and very accurate expressions for the r.d.f .",

    "they can be used to determine @xmath24 in expressions ( [ eq : f2mc ] ) and ( [ eq : f2lc ] ) . regarding @xmath34 , which appears explicitly in expression ( [ eq : f2mc ] ) and",
    "implicitly in ( [ eq : f2lc ] ) , it can be obtained from the well - known carnahan  starling @xcite equation of state @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the packing fraction .",

    "the r.d.f @xmath42 of the sw fluid depends on the packing fraction @xmath43 , the reduced temperature @xmath44 and , parametrically , on the well width @xmath2 . in principle",
    ", one has to resort to numerical solutions of integral equation theories . on the other hand ,",
    "particularly suitable for the purpose of obtaining the heat capacity is the heuristic model proposed by yuste and santos @xcite and recently simplified by acedo and santos @xcite , which is analytical and fairly accurate .",
    "henceforth we will refer to this model as the yuste ",
    "santos ( yas ) model .",
    "it is based on expressing the laplace transform @xmath45 of @xmath46 in the form @xmath47^ne^{-nt } } , \\label{eq : g(t)}\\ ] ] where the auxiliary function @xmath48 is assumed to have the form @xcite @xmath49 the coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are _ explicit _ functions of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath2 determined from consistency conditions .",
    "we refer the interested reader to refs.@xcite for further details . the yas model ( [ eq : f(t ) ] )",
    "reduces to the exact solutions of the percus  yevick ( py ) equation in the limit of hard spheres ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) @xcite , as well as in the limit of sticky hard spheres ( @xmath55 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 ) @xcite . from that point of view , the approximation ( [ eq : f(t ) ] ) can be seen as a simple extension to finite widths of baxter s solution of the py equation for sticky hard spheres .    upon laplace inversion of eq.([eq : g(t ) ] ) , the final expression of the r.d.f .",
    "reads @xmath59 where the functions @xmath60 are the inverse laplace transforms of @xmath61^{n}$ ] and @xmath62 is heaviside s step function .",
    "therefore , to determine the r.d.f .",
    "for @xmath63 only the first @xmath64 terms in the summation ( [ eq : g(r)-sw ] ) are needed .",
    "in particular , for the values of @xmath65 considered in this paper , one has @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are the three roots of the cubic equation @xmath69 .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) into eq.([eq : cve - ee_sw ] ) , we finally get @xmath70 . \\label{2}\\ ] ]    the heat capacity can also be obtained from the yas r.d.f . by following the virial and compressibility routes to the equation of state .",
    "the reason for the choice of the energy route ( [ eq : ee ] ) is two - fold .",
    "first , it is obviously the most direct route to determine the heat capacity .",
    "second , we have checked that the other routes yield results that present larger deviations from the simulation data .",
    "this latter observation is consistent with the case of the py theory for sticky hard spheres @xcite and for sw fluids @xcite .",
    "results obtained for @xmath0 from the second - order barker  henderson perturbation theory within the local compressibility approximation as well as within the macroscopic compressibility approximation are compared in figs .",
    "[ cv11][cv15 ] with the simulation data of table [ table - cve ] .",
    "we can see that although the local compressibility approximation provides a better agreement with simulation data , both approximations are rather poor at low temperatures",
    ". this might be due either to the insufficient accuracy of both the local compressibility and the macroscopic compressibility approximations or to the fact that higher order terms , beyond the second one , in the expansion of the helmholtz free energy in power series of the inverse of the reduced temperature , have a nonnegligible contribution to the heat capacity . in order to determine which of these two possibilities is the right one",
    ", we can use for @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cve - per ] ) simulation data , thus avoiding theoretical approximations .",
    "these simulations were performed by barker and henderson @xcite who reported the results in terms of a function depending on forty five parameters for each density .",
    "these parameters were determined from a least squares fitting of their simulation data .",
    "since the use of that fitting is somewhat tedious , we have preferred to use directly simulation data for @xmath71 , which are available for several densities and well widths @xcite , to determine @xmath0 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cve - per ] ) . as one can see in figs",
    ".  [ cv11][cv15 ] , results thus obtained are much closer to the theoretical results derived from the bh second - order perturbation theory than to the values of @xmath0 obtained from direct simulations , except in the high density limit .",
    "this means that the main reason of the failure of the barker - henderson perturbation theory in predicting the heat capacity of sw fluids arises in the truncation of the perturbative series at the level of the second order term , the higher order terms having a nonnegligible contribution .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation for the equation of state @xcite , which is accurately given by the second - order bh perturbation theory even at relatively low temperatures for wide ranges of densities and potential wells .",
    "the reason is that , as pointed before , the constant - volume excess heat capacity is a thermodynamic property particularly sensitive to the performance of a theory and therefore the influence of higher order terms , which is small in the equation of state , may be important in the heat capacity .",
    "this is particularly true for low values of the potential width , since the lower the potential width , the slower the convergence of the bh perturbation theory at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "a much better agreement is obtained with yas theory , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , at low to moderate densities , as shown in the same figures .",
    "this theory , in contrast to the bh theory , provides a better agreement with the simulation data of @xmath0 as the potential width decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , as said before , the yas model is an extension to @xmath72 of the py solution for sticky hard spheres and hence it is expected to be as accurate as the py theory at least for small @xmath73 .",
    "the structural properties predicted by the yas model for the sw fluid also exhibits a good agreement with simulation data for low values of @xmath73 whereas the accuracy worsens as @xmath2 increases @xcite . figures [ cv11][cv15 ] show that , given a well width @xmath2 , the yas values of @xmath0 are more accurate as the temperature increases and/or the density decreases .    in conclusion , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the constant - volume excess heat capacity of sw fluids of variable width for a wide range of densities and at several characteristic temperatures .",
    "this thermodynamic quantity vanishes for hard spheres and so it represents an important measure of the influence of attractive forces on the state of the fluid .",
    "moreover , the heat capacity seems to provide a rather stringent test to assess the accuracy of theoretical approaches . in this paper",
    "we have compared the simulation data with the barker ",
    "henderson perturbation theory @xcite and with a non - perturbative theory developed by yuste , acedo , and santos @xcite .",
    "while the former theory presents a poor performance , which can be attributed to the truncation of the perturvative series to second order rather than the inaccuracy of the theory itself , the non - perturbative theory does a fairly good job , especially for narrow wells , except at low temperatures and high densities .",
    "although a potential well of @xmath18 is appropriate for many simple fluids , sw fluids with lower values of @xmath2 may be of interest because the properties of certain colloidal suspensions are well reproduced by considering sw interactions with narrow potential widths . therefore , as several theories for sw fluids have achieved a considerable accuracy for the equation of state and the pair correlation function of sw fluids , the constant volume excess heat capacity seems to be a suitable thermodynamic property to discriminate between them . in this context , we expect that our simulation data can stimulate other studies on the heat capacity of sw fluids of variable width and can be used to check the reliability of other approximations .",
