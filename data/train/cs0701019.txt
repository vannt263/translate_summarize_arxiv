    "it is well known that the performance of a wireless network can be significantly improved by cooperative transmission among nodes in the network .",
    "many cooperative transmission designs aim to exploit cooperative diversity that is inherently present in the network .",
    "such designs have been suggested in @xcite for cellular networks .",
    "recently there has been much interest in achieving cooperative diversity in a classical three - node relay channel @xcite , which represents the simplest wireless network that can derive advantages from cooperative transmission .",
    "the relay channel has been thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "bounds on the capacity have been given for the general relay channel , and the capacity has been calculated for the special case of degraded relay channels .",
    "the coding techniques suggested in @xcite assume that the relay can operate in a full - duplex manner ; i.e. , it can transmit and receive at the same time .",
    "it is commonly argued that full - duplex operation is not practical for most existing wireless transceivers .",
    "thus the restriction of half - duplex operation at the relay is usually considered in cooperative transmission designs .",
    "since the relay can not transmit and receive simultaneously , a time - division approach is employed in half - duplex relaying @xcite .",
    "the source first transmits to the destination , and the relay listens and `` captures '' @xcite the transmission from the source at the same time .",
    "then the relay aids the transmission by sending processed source information to the destination .",
    "note that the source may still send data to the destination when the relay transmits .",
    "several techniques to process and forward the received data by the relay have been suggested .",
    "these techniques include the decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) approaches @xcite . in the df approach , the relay decodes the received signal from the source and then forwards a re - encoded signal to the destination . in the af approach ,",
    "the relay simply amplifies and forwards the signal received from the source to the destination .",
    "the performance of the df approach is limited by the capability of the relay to correctly decode the signal received from the source .",
    "this in turn depends on the quality of the link from the source to the relay . on the other hand",
    ", the af approach performs poorly in low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) situations in which the relay forwards mainly noise to the destination .",
    "in addition , the time - division approach leads to rate losses that are significant when the relay channel is to support high rates . some enhanced versions of the af and df approaches have been proposed to solve the rate loss problem . a distributed space - time - coding protocol is developed in @xcite .",
    "an incremental af technique which requires feedback from the destination to the source is developed in @xcite .",
    "the non - orthogonal af and dynamic df techniques suggested in @xcite allow the duration of the relay listening to the transmission from the source to adapt to the condition of the link from the source to the relay .",
    "in particular , the dynamic df technique is shown to be superior to all the cooperative diversity techniques ( except perhaps the incremental relaying techniques ) mentioned above . a bursty af technique is also suggested in @xcite to solve the noise forwarding problem of the af approach when the snr is low .",
    "it is shown that the bursty af technique achieves the best outage performance at the asymptotically low snr regime .",
    "we note that all these cooperative diversity techniques mentioned so far are designed with the constraint that channel state information is not available at the source and the relay . some practical code designs for the df and space - time - coding approaches",
    "have been suggested in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    when the links in the relay channel suffer from slow fading , it is conceivable that the channel state information ( or at least the channel quality information ) can be estimated and passed to the nodes .",
    "the source and relay may then use this information to optimize the cooperative protocol to achieve better performance .",
    "such a design has been considered in @xcite , in which optimal power control is performed at the source and relay in order to maximize the ergodic rates achieved by the df and compress - forward approaches .    in this paper , we assume that the channel state information is available , and we develop time - division cooperative diversity designs that perform well in both high - rate and low - rate scenarios .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of the proposed approach , compared with the cooperative designs mentioned above , is that we do not employ the approach of the relay `` capturing '' the transmission from the source to the destination .",
    "instead , we divide the information to be sent to the destination into three flows .",
    "the source employs cooperative broadcasting @xcite to intentionally send two _ distinct _ flows of data to the relay and destination , respectively , in the first time slot .",
    "the relay helps to forward , in the df manner , the data that it receives to the destination in the second time slot , during which the source concurrently sends the remaining flow of data to the destination .",
    "the transmit powers of the source and relay as well as the durations of the time slots are optimized according to the link conditions and the rate requirement .",
    "this constitutes a form of optimal flow control .",
    "due to the df nature of the proposed design , there is an implicit restriction on the decoding delay .",
    "thus we will employ the capacity - versus - outage framework @xcite to evaluate the performance of the proposed design .",
    "we will show that the proposed design can efficiently achieve cooperative diversity in both high - rate and low - rate scenarios . in particular , when the rate requirement is asymptotically small , the outage performance of the proposed design approaches that of full - duplex relaying with df , giving a second - order diversity performance . on the other hand ,",
    "when the rate requirement is asymptotically large , the proposed approach still gives a close - to - second - order diversity performance .",
    "moreover , the design also gives the best diversity - multiplexing tradeoff @xcite possible for the relay channel .",
    "together with the application of optimal long - term power control @xcite , the design can give very good delay - limited rate performance again in both low - rate and high - rate scenarios .",
    "we note that the two basic building blocks for the proposed approach are cooperative broadcasting ( cb ) in the first time slot and multiple access ( ma ) in the second time slot .",
    "the combination of cb and ma allows distinct flows of data be sent through the relay and through the direct link from the source to the destination , and hence can be viewed as a generalized form of routing .",
    "a practical advantage of the proposed design is that the basic building blocks are the well known cb and ma approaches .",
    "practical ma coding designs have been well studied , e.g. see @xcite , while practical cb coding designs are currently available @xcite@xcite .",
    "consider a classical three - node relay network , which consists of a source node 1 , a relay node 2 , and a destination node 3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : relay ] .",
    "we assume that each link in the figure is a bandpass gaussian channel with bandwidth @xmath2 and one - sided noise spectral density @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the power gain of the link from node @xmath5 to node @xmath6 .",
    "the link power gains are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) exponential random variables with unit mean .",
    "this corresponds to the case of independent rayleigh fading channels with unit average power gains .",
    "the results in the sequel can be easily generalized to include the case of non - uniform average power gains .    in this section ,",
    "we consider the case in which the relay node is capable of supporting full - duplex operation .",
    "our goal is to support an information rate of @xmath7 nats / s / hz from the source to the destination .",
    "we assume that the link power gains change slowly so that they can be estimated , and hence the power gain information is available at all nodes .",
    "the source and relay nodes can make use of this information to control their respective transmit power and time so that the total transmit energy is minimized . for convenience ,",
    "we consider a slotted communication system with unit - duration time slots .",
    "let @xmath8 be the total transmit energy of the source and relay needed to support the transmission of @xmath9 nats of information from the source to the destination in a time slot .",
    "since the duration of a time slot is one , @xmath8 is also the total average transmit power required . although interpreting @xmath8 as the total average power may not carry any significant physical meaning , it is customary to speak of `` power '' rather than `` energy '' in for communication engineers .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will hereafter consider a normalized version of @xmath8 , namely the rate - normalized overall signal - to - noise ratio ( rnsnr ) of the network : @xmath10 the rnsnr can be interpreted as the additional snr , in db , needed to support the required rate of @xmath7 nats / s / hz , in excess of the snr required to support the same rate in a simple gaussian channel with unit gain .",
    "this normalization is convenient as we will consider asymptotic cases when @xmath7 approaches zero and infinity .",
    "we note that the use of the rnsnr to characterize our results has two important implications .",
    "first , since the total transmit energy of the source and relay is used in defining the rnsnr , no individual power limits are put on the source and relay .",
    "the results in this paper can be viewed as bounds if additional individual power limits are imposed .",
    "our choice of focusing on the total energy comes from the viewpoint that the relay channel considered forms a small component of a larger wireless network . in this sense",
    ", it is fairer to compare the total transmit energy incurred in sending information from the source to the destination by employing cooperative diversity to that incurred in direct transmission .",
    "second , the normalization by the factor @xmath11 implies that the additional snr in db to combat fading can only be a _",
    "constant _ over the snr required to achieve the target rate in a gaussian channel , regardless of the rate requirement .",
    "that is , we restrict the snr to increase at the same rate as in a gaussian channel to cope with increases in the transmission rate through the relay channel . in a sense , this restriction enforces efficiency of energy usage .    employing well known capacity bounds on the relay channel @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the following bounds on the rnsnr to support required spectral efficiency of @xmath7nats / s / hz .    [ thm : fd ] for any fixed positive link power gains @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , define the bound @xmath15 and @xmath16 then @xmath17 is a sufficient condition in order to support the rate of @xmath7nats / s / hz from the source to destination .",
    "also @xmath18 is a necessary condition in order to support the rate of @xmath7nats / s / hz from the source to destination .",
    "see appendix  [ app : fd ] .",
    "the rnsnr @xmath19 is achieved by the df approach employing the block markov coding suggested in @xcite .",
    "we also need to optimally allocate transmit energy between the source and relay nodes .",
    "in addition , the availability of channel state information ( both magnitudes and phases of the fading coefficients of all three links ) as well as symbol timing and carrier phase synchronization at all the three nodes are implicitly assumed . the lower bound @xmath20 is based on the max - flow - min - cut bound in @xcite .",
    "no known coding technique can achieve this bound .",
    "in this section , we will consider the more practical scenario in which the relay node operates in the following half - duplex fashion .",
    "we partition each unit time slot into two sub - slots with respective durations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in the first time slot",
    ", the source transmits while the relay and destination receive . in the second time slot ,",
    "the source and relay transmit , and the destination receives . based on this half - duplex mode of operation , we will describe two cooperative communication protocols that make use of the two basic components of cooperative broadcasting ( cb ) from the source to the relay in the first time slot and multiple access ( ma ) from the source and relay in the second time slot",
    ". the first protocol does not require phase synchronization among the three nodes , while the second protocol does so .      in this protocol ,",
    "the information from the source to the destination is divided into three flows of data @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 . in the first time slot",
    ", the source sends , via cb , two flows of rates @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the destination and relay , respectively . in the second time slot ,",
    "the relay and source send , via ma , two flows of rates @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the destination , respectively . the information flow of rate @xmath30 sent by the relay in the second time slot is from the flow of rate @xmath29 that it receives and decodes in the first time slot .",
    "we choose @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 to minimize the total power transmitted by the source and relay to support the rate @xmath7nats / s / hz from the source to the destination .    to determine the minimum rnsnr that can support the required rate when this protocol is employed , we start with the following lemma .",
