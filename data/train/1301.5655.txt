    "the most common technique of proving achievability of rate regions in information theory is random coding . traditionally , the distribution induced on the ensemble of codes is such that individual codewords are mutually independent .",
    "furthermore , in communication models with multiple terminals , codebooks associated with these terminals are mutually independent of each other .",
    "such an analysis has proved sufficient for single user and particular multi - terminal communication problems .    the problem of distributed reconstruction of modulo-2 sum of binary correlated sources studied by krner and marton @xcite proved to be the first exception .",
    "as against to partitioning the source codes independently and uniformly into bins , they propose partitioning using cosets of a common linear code , thus building dependency across codebooks and codewords . crucially exploiting the property of closure under addition of these cosets ,",
    "they analyze a coding technique that strictly outperforms the best known strategy based on independent unstructured codes .",
    "recently , a similar phenomenon has been identified by philosof and zamir @xcite for a particular example of multiple access channel with state information distributed at the transmitters ( mac - dstx ) . restricting their attention to a binary symmetric noiseless additive doubly dirty mac - dstx ( bdd - mac )",
    ", they propose a partition of the two channel codes into bins using cosets of a common linear code .",
    "they propose a coding technique , henceforth referred to as pz - technique , that achieves the capacity of bdd - mac and thereby prove strict sub - optimality of the best known coding technique based on independent unstructured codes .",
    "this is in contrast to point - to - point channels with state information at the transmitter ( ptp - stx ) where unstructured codes achieve the capacity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless ingenious , pz - technique @xcite is very specific to the additive and symmetric nature of the bdd - mac studied therein .",
    "this technique being strictly more efficient than the currently known best strategy based on independent unstructured codes raises the following question .",
    "is there a general coding framework for communicating over an _",
    "arbitrary _ discrete mac - dstx , that reduces to the pz - technique for the bdd - mac , and that would yield an achievable rate region strictly larger than the best known achievable rate region using unstructured independent codes even for non - additive and non - symmetric mac - dstx ?    in this article , we propose an algebraic framework for communication over an arbitrary mac - dstx and thereby answer the above questions in the affirmative .",
    "our first step is to generalize the ensemble of linear codes employed in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that linear codes do not achieve the capacity of point - to - point channels with or without state information available at the transmitter .",
    "they achieve only the mutual information of the channel with uniform input distribution .",
    "we propose , in section [ sec : nestedcosetptp - stxcodes ] , an ensemble of codes , called _ nested coset codes _ , composed of two linear codes with one of them being a subset of the other , and prove in section [ subsec : nestedcosetcodesachievecapacityofarbitrarypointtopointchannels ] , that they achieve the capacity of arbitrary ptp - stx , which is the first main result of this article . using nested coset codes we are able to induce non - uniform single - letter distributions on the input alphabet while retaining much of useful algebraic structure and thus match any input distribution to the channel . achieving the capacity of arbitrary",
    "ptp - stx relies on employing joint typical encoding and decoding .",
    "the foundation of our framework is therefore a study of codes endowed with an algebraic structure , nested coset codes in this case , using typical set encoding and decoding .",
    "we present our coding scheme for mac - dstx in three pedagogical stages .",
    "we begin by identifying two key elements of pz - technique 1 ) decoding mod@xmath0 sum , instead of the pair of codewords chosen by the two transmitters and 2 ) choosing the bins of each user s code to be cosets of a common linear code to enable containment of the range of this mod@xmath0 sum .",
    "the first stage , presented in section [ subsec : anachievablerateregionforarbitrarymac - dstxusingnestedcosetcodes ] , captures all of the nontrivial elements of our framework in it s simplest setting . in this stage",
    "we employ nested coset codes built on finite fields , to decode the sum of codewords .",
    "the analysis of this technique enables us to derive a new achievable rate region for mac - dstx .",
    "the key elements of the first stage are ( i ) the use of nested coset codes to induce non - uniform input distributions , ( ii ) the use of joint typical encoding and decoding that enables us to analyze the probability of error over an _ arbitrary _ mac - dstx that is not constrained to be additive or symmetric , and ( iii ) an analysis of decoding of the sum of the pair of transmitted codewords chosen from two dependent codebooks .",
    "indeed , the analysis of joint typical encoding and decoding of correlated codebooks with statistically dependent codewords involves several new elements .",
    "the reader is encouraged to peruse these in the proof of theorem [ thm : achievablerateregionusingnestedcosetcodes ] .",
    "the significance of the rate region proved achievable in the first stage is illustrated through examples in section [ subsec : examples ] .. notwithstanding this , it is easy to argue significance of our generalization by appealing to continuity .",
    "an additive channel can be perturbed slightly to result in a non - additive channel for which the technique proposed in @xcite may not be applicable as is . by continuity of the rate regions as a function of the channel parameters , one can see why the proposed coding scheme must perform strictly better than unstructured independent coding .",
    "example [ ex : example5 ] presented in section [ subsec : examples ] corroborates this . ] in particular , we provide an example for which it is necessary to induce non - uniform input distributions and is more efficient to decode the sum of transmitted codewords .",
    "we also randomly perturb the bdd - mac and demonstrate that coding framework proposed herein can outperform unstructured independent codes .",
    "the channels being non - additive , it is significantly harder to provide analytical comparisons , and hence we resort to direct computation of rate regions achievable using unstructured independent and nested coset codes .",
    "these examples illustrate that structured - code based strategies do not hinge on the channel being additive but would benefit as long as the optimizing test channel from the auxiliary inputs to the channel output is not far from additive .",
    "does the rate region proved achievable using nested coset codes subsume the largest known achievable rate region using unstructured independent codes ?",
    "it is our belief that strategies based on structured codes are not in lieu of their counterparts based on unstructured codes . in most cases , structured codes enable efficient decoding of a ` compressive ' is ` compressive ' if @xmath1 is significantly lower than @xmath2 . ]",
    "function of the two codewords .",
    "however , for decoding both the codewords , it turns out the strategy of using a common linear code to effect partition of the two codebooks is not optimal , instead one has to employ two independent linear codes .",
    "the rate region achieved using the latter strategy is equivalent to that achieved using unstructured independent codes .",
    "sum of binary sources , krner marton strategy @xcite based on common linear codes is outperformed by slepian - wolf @xcite strategy ( or equivalently the strategy of csiszr based on independent linear codes @xcite . ) for the class of source distributions for which the modulo@xmath0 sum is not sufficiently compressive .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath3 , then it is better to reconstruct @xmath4 using the technique of slepian - wolf or csiszr . ] this leads us to the second stage of our coding scheme which is presented in section [ sec : aunifiedachievablerateregion ] .",
    "following the approach of ahlswede and han ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vi ) , we glue together structured and unstructured coding techniques to derive an achievable rate region for communicating over a mac - dstx that combines structured and unstructured coding techniques .",
    "we present an example to illustrate how the gluing of unstructured and structured coding techniques can yield a rate region larger than either one , and their union .",
    "we remark that in spite of our inability to compute the achievable rate region proposed in section [ sec : aunifiedachievablerateregion ] , we are able to demonstrate the significance of the same through an example",
    ".    if the channel is far from additive , it may not be efficient to decode the sum , with respect to a finite field , of codewords .",
    "for example , if the mac - dstx is doubly dirty with field addition replaced by addition of an abelian group , referred to as group addition or group sum , then it is natural to decode group sum of codewords . in other words",
    ", the technique of decoding sum of codewords must be generalized to decoding any arbitrary bivariate function of the auxiliary inputs . in the third stage of our coding scheme , presented in section [ sec : enlargingachievablerateregionusingcodesovergroups ] , we consider decoding the group sum of the codewords .",
    "specifically , codebooks are built over abelian group alphabets and each encoder is provided with codebooks that possess a certain group structure .",
    "analogous to the first stage , we propose joint typical encoding and decoding of group codes .",
    "though essential elements of this analysis are similar to that of decoding sum of codewords chosen from nested coset codes over an _ arbitrary _",
    "mac - dstx , the algebraic structure of a abelian group being looser , leads to several new elements .",
    "the importance of ( i ) decoding an appropriate bivariate function of codewords , and ( ii ) endowing codebooks with the appropriate algebraic structure is illustrated through an example discussed in section [ sec : enlargingachievablerateregionusingcodesovergroups ] .",
    "specifically , we indicate using numerical computation that for a quaternary doubly dirty mac - dstx ( qdd - mac ) wherein the operation is mod@xmath5 addition , decoding mod@xmath5 sum , which is the group operation in the quaternary alphabet , of the codewords strictly outperforms both independent unstructured and nested coset codes based strategies . in fact , significant gains for this problem are achievable using abelian group codes .",
    "the reader is encouraged to peruse details in section [ sec : enlargingachievablerateregionusingcodesovergroups ] .",
    "several findings in the context of multi - terminal communication problems point to efficient strategies based on structured codes .",
    "nazer and gastpar @xcite propose a strategy based on linear codes for computing the sum of sources over additive multiple access channels that outperforms earlier known strategies .",

    "we summarize by stating the significance of our contribution .",
    "nested coset codes is currently the only ensemble of codes possessing an algebraic structure that has been proven to be optimal for general point - to - point channels .",
    "we employ the same to derive the largest known achievable rate region for a general discrete mac - dstx .",
    "perhaps more importantly , our findings hint at a general theory of structured codes . thus far ,",
    "linear and nested linear codes have been employed to derive communication strategies for particular additive source and channel coding problems that outperform the best known techniques based on independent unstructured codes .",
    "our findings indicate that strategies based on structured codes can be employed to analyze more intelligent encoding and decoding techniques for an arbitrary multi - terminal communication problem .",
    "this opens up the possibility of exploiting new degrees of freedom to enlarge achievable rate regions for many multi - terminal communication problems that have resisted a solution .",
