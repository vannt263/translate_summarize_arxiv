    ", this will yield a new representation in variable @xmath46 for hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) where the nonresonant terms ( more specifically the four - wave interaction terms ) will involve both @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "arbitrariness of @xmath162 implies that we can select this to eliminate the total four - wave nonresonant interaction term , @xmath42 present within the hamiltonian . in our case ,",
    "@xmath163 this choice is valid as the denominator will not vanish due to the nonresonance of four - wave interactions .",

    "this term does not contribute to the six - wave resonant dynamics as the factor in front will vanish on the resonant manifold that appears in the kinetic equation .",
    "however , we can select @xmath167 to equal @xmath168 off the resonant manifold .",
    "this enables us to write @xmath164 as equation ( [ eq : hc ] ) , where the explicit formula for @xmath168 stemming from the transformation is @xmath169    zakharov and schulman discovered a parametrisation @xcite for the six - wave resonant condition with @xmath170 , @xmath171\\nonumber,\\\\ k_2&=&p+r\\left[u+\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}-3v\\right]\\nonumber,\\\\ k_3&=&p -\\frac{2r}{u}-2ru,\\\\ k_4&=&p + \\frac{2r}{u}-2ru\\nonumber,\\\\ k_5&=&p+r\\left[u-\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}+3v\\right]\\nonumber,\\\\ k_6&=&p+r\\left[u-\\frac{1}{u}-\\frac{1}{v}-3v\\right]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this parametrisation allows us to explicitly calculate @xmath168 on the resonant manifold .",
    "this is important beecause the wave kinetics take place on this manifold , that corresponds to the delta functions within the kinetic equation .",

    "<S> the model is obtained from a truncated expansion of the 2d local induction approximation and it is shown to support six - wave interactions . </S>",

    "<S> these were predicted by kelvin more than one century ago and experimentally observed about 50 years ago in superfluid @xmath0 . at very low temperature , where the friction induced by normal fluid component can be neglected </S>",
    "<S> , kelvin waves can be dissipated only at very high frequencies by phonon emission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore at lower frequency energy is transferred among different wavenumbers by the nonlinear coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is the mechanism at the basis of the kelvin wave cascade which sustains superfluid turbulence @xcite .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , single vortex kelvin wave cascade has attracted much theoretical @xcite , numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention . even within the classical one - dimensional vortex model , </S>",
    "<S> different degrees of simplification are possible . for small amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> , the vortex configuration can be described by a two component vector field , made of the coordinates of the vortex line in the plane transverse to the direction of the unperturbed filament . </S>",
    "<S> these depend on the single coordinate that runs along the filament . </S>",
    "<S> this system of equations admits a hamiltonian formulation , dubbed the two - dimensional biot - savart formulation ( 2d - bs ) , see ( [ eq : h2d ] ) below . </S>",
    "<S> another , more drastic , simplification is obtained by considering local interactions only . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the local induction approximation ( lia ) which was originally derived starting from the full 3d - bs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main limitation of lia is that it generates an integrable system with infinite conserved quantities , as it is equivalent to the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , and therefore the resonant wave interactions are absent ( at all orders ) and one can not reproduce the phenomenology of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason lia , despite its simplicity , is of little help for the study of kelvin wave turbulence .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the simplest model for vortex filament able to sustain a turbulent energy cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the model is obtained in the limit of small amplitudes by a taylor expansion of the 2d - lia . </S>",

    "<S> the geometrical constraint of small amplitude perturbation can be expressed in terms of a parameter @xmath12    an enormous simplification , both for theoretical and numerical purposes , is obtained by means of the so called local induction approximation ( lia ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is justified by the observation that ( [ eq : bse ] ) is divergent as @xmath13 and is obtained by introducing a cutoff at @xmath14 in the integral in ( [ eq : bse ] ) which represents the vortex filament radius . </S>",

    "<S> thus , in the following we will use the simplest model which arises naturally from the truncated expansion of the lia hamiltonian .    </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , a clear scaling compatible with the dimensional analysis of the kinetic equation is observed over about a decade .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a minimal model for kelvin wave turbulence , and presented an argument why this model should be preferential over bse . </S>",
    "<S> namely , this model is much simpler than bse and it has the same degree of validity due to the vortex core shape sensitivity and uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we have used our model for numerical simulations of the direct and the inverse cascades and found spectra which are in very good agreement with the predictions of the wt theory . </S>"
