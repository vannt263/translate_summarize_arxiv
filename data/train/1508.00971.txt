    "the final achievement of modified gravity in this direction was the extension of the method of the disformal transformations of the metric of arbitrary dimensions , successfully used by authors in the investigation of cosmological as well as of gravitational equalities , to any system whatever of mutually interacting components like dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we further supposed that the dark components are interacting like fluids , but each perceiving what was passing in the other , and acting in consequence by interaction term @xmath0 .",
    "this letter was the first to investigate and describe in mimetic gravity the fact that a cosmological solution at a distance had the power of invariance from initial condition to final state , and it also found that in some interacting cases the stable submanifold was produced .",

    "<S> * abstract : * in this paper , we investigate the mathematical modeling for the cosmological attractors propagated in mimetic gravity upon which an interacting dark energy - dark matter is supposed to be existed . the average value of the interaction of these percentages , namely @xmath0 say , may be used to investigate generally the modeling of an attractor ; the actual value could only be determined by data in any particular case . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen , for example , that it was led to investigate the subject of initially invariant submanifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _ in many passages of our studies on large scale structure of the whole universe , observational data had distinctly stated that the current epoch of universe which it dominated here give an explanation of the acceleration expansion of the universe . namely the data from supernovae sne ia @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiations via wmap @xcite , galaxy redshift surveys via sdss @xcite and galactic x - ray @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but only the means of observing and connecting them together with theory ; that the meaning of all phenomena , and the reason of their peculiar connexions , was a philosophical problem which required to be attacked from a different point of view ; and that the significance especially which lay in the phenomena of matter contents and exotic form of it would only unfold itself if by an exhaustive survey of the entire fully theoretical description , individually , consistently , and physically , we gain the necessary data for deciding what meaning attaches to the existence of this current acceleration expansion , or dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) in the contents of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> de is considered as an exotic matter with negative effective pressure to energy density ratio in a very recent epoch @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such type of energy brings two important unsolved problems : the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the best candidates for de are the quintessence scalar field or a phantom energy field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical modifications of einstein gravity are also interesting and have been studied widely in literatures @xcite-@xcite . in the case , however , of many observatories @xcite-@xcite , especially as regards the older records , many data for interacting de - dm exist ; further , the decay of de to the dm and unparticle is at best only an approximation @xcite,@xcite , the success attending which probably varies considerably at different stations @xcite . when the continuity equations are satisfied for different types of matter(energy ) contents with interaction terms , a phase space description is found to be useful @xcite-@xcite . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> we present , a suitable multidimensional representation of a first order dynamical system in which each dimension corresponds to one density of the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a point of phase space corresponds to a specific state of the system , and a path represents the evolution of the density functions of the system through different states . </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this letter is to perform phase space description for an interacting de - dm system in a type of modified gravity , called as mimetic gravity ( mg ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ basic equations _ another opportunity to solve de problem will present a type of disformal invariant theory , where we might be identified with a specific reparametrization of the metric @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3}{\\kappa^2}+\\mathcal{l}_m\\},\\ ] ] here we suppose that @xmath4 represents an auxiliary metric and @xmath5 denotes an auxiliary ( non ghost)scalar field . </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding continuity equations for three components can be written in the following system : @xmath15 to preserve the total continuty , the interaction functions must satisfy collectively such that @xmath16 . to define an autonomous dynamical system , it is needed to define dimensionless density parameters via the following set of new variables : @xmath17 using the flrw eqs </S>",

    "<S> the interaction term @xmath32 must be supposed to act upon the coordinates ( [ 3 ] ) in its actual condition , whereas in ( [ dyn1]-[dyn3 ] ) , previously cited , the system is supposed to be absolutely autonomous .    </S>",
    "<S> _ analysis of stability in phase space _ in this phase space approach it is assumed that the system ( [ dyn1]-[dyn3 ] ) is autonomous , and this assumption is sufficiently accurate for any practical purpose to which the above systems would be applicable in the ordinary analysing of a local stability point . </S>",
    "<S> but this was based upon the assumption of a density-@xmath28 relation between interaction terms , the interaction function @xmath0 of which depended on their relative densities @xmath27 as well as on hubble parameter @xmath28 . this being the case , we are at liberty to make the assumption that the interaction function of each term in ( [ dyn1]-[dyn3 ] ) ( under specified conditions ) is known , without thereby introducing any risk of self - contradiction in mathematical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption has the great advantage , that the last interaction terms in ( [ dyn1]-[dyn3 ] ) now appears as the autonomous term of the components @xmath33 . </S>",
