    "there are very few observations @xcite indicating the existence of intermediate mass black holes .",

    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses of @xmath7 m@xmath6 ( or perhaps even higher ) on the other hand are quite frequent , residing in the centre of each sufficiently massive galaxy .",
    "their growth occurs by accretion phases and by mergers , the estimated contribution of each of these processes to the growth of mass being model - dependent .",
    "recent observations @xcite show that some galaxies never merge , and yet may have central back holes ; representing either the pure smbh birth population , or the birth population with some gaseous accretion .",
    "the accretion process has been modeled with the inclusion of magnetic fields , electromagnetic radiation of the disk and energetic jets transporting angular momentum from the polar regions @xcite - accretion . beside increasing the mass , accretion will also spin up the black holes .",
    "the spin limit reached due to accretion by canonical black holes ( the system of a black hole and electromagnetically radiating accretion disk ) , as expressed in terms of the dimensionless spin is @xmath8 , close to the theoretically allowed maximum for a black hole , the unity .",
    "indeed , such a high spin powering the jets seems compulsory forunderstanding the low energy cutoff in the energetic electron spectra of jets in radio galaxies @xcite .",

    "dynamical friction transfers some of the orbital angular momentum of the binary black hole system to the stellar environment , being ejected at the poles , a process which drives the system through the last parsec @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms to overcome the last parsec are relaxation processes due to cloud / star  star interactions , repopulating the stellar orbits in the center of the galaxy @xcite , binary orbital decay by three - body interactions in the gravitationally bound stellar cusps @xcite , or the interplay of three accretion disks : one around each black hole and the third , circumbinary , removing orbital angular momentum from the binary hayasaki .    at about @xmath9 parsecs gravitational radiation takes over dynamical friction as the leading dissipative effect @xcite .",
    "for many smbh binaries the gravitational waves emitted in the process of coalescence fall into the frequency range the long - delayed space mission lisa @xcite . depending on how rich in gas the binary environment may be and whether there any circumbinary disk has been formed , certain alignment between the proper spins and the orbital angular momentum could occur due to the bardeen - petterson effect ( based in turn on the lense - thirring precession ) @xcite .",
    "the two situations which could occur are the mergers precessing under random angle ( also known as dry mergers ) and non - precessing mergers , implying complete alignment of the spins and orbital angular momentum ( wet mergers ) .",
    "the randomness in the orientation of precessing mergers typically reduces the final spin @xcite . for equal mass precessing mergers",
    "this varies from @xmath10 for non - spinning black holes up to values of @xmath11 for maximally spinning black holes @xcite . for a mass ratio @xmath12",

    "non - precessing mergers all configurations would practically conserve a high initial spin during the inspiral .",
    "when the two black holes are at large distances , the orbital angular momentum @xmath15 is always much larger then the individual spins @xmath16 .",
    "however at the characteristic radius @xmath17 parsec depends weakly , as @xmath18 on the total mass and negligibly , as @xmath19 on the symmetric mass ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the reduced mass . ]",
    "( and the corresponding post - newtonian ( pn ) parameter @xmath22 , defining the beginning of the inspiral , see @xcite ) , where gravitational radiation takes over dynamical friction as the leading order dissipative effect , the ratios @xmath23 depend on the mass ratio @xmath24 . for a maximally spinning larger black hole and separation @xmath25",
    "the ratio is one at about @xmath26 . for mass ratios larger than @xmath27",
    "therefore the spin dominates over the orbital angular momentum during the whole inspiral .    during the inspiral gravitational radiation further reduces the orbital angular momentum , but not the spin magnitudes .",
    "the spins will only precess driven by the leading order spin - orbit coupling and corrections due to spin - spin and mass quadrupole - mass monopole coupling @xcite . in the process",
    "the direction of the total angular momentum remains unchanged , in an averaged sense over one radial orbit @xcite .",
    "gravitational radiation does not modify this conclusion on short time - scales .",
    "radiative evolutions with spin - orbit @xcite , spin - spin @xcite and mass quadrupole - mass monopole @xcite couplings have been investigated , and their analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to the important result that the instantaneous radiative changes of the spins average out during a radial period . on this timescale",
    "therefore there is no secular radiative change of the spin vectors at all:@xmath28this result confirms that the spin dynamics can be regarded as a pure precession , up to high pn orders including radiation reaction , on the timescales comparable with a radial orbit . on much larger timescales",
    "however the spin vector will undergo a reorientation ( spin - flip ) , as explained in detail in ref .",

    "there are several scenarios possible , according to the actual mass ratio : :    \\a ) the masses are comparable @xmath29 . in this case at the end of the inspiral ( when the pn approximation breaks down ) the orbital angular momentum still dominates over the spins @xcite , @xcite .",
    "radiating away this remnant orbital angular momentum during the merger phase , while extrapolating the conservation of the direction of the total angular momentum and of the individual spin magnitudes to this phase finalspin , @xcite could significantly reduce the final spin in all cases when the individual spins were severely misaligned with each other and with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "such a misalignment would be typical in the case of precessing mergers .",
    "therefore for equal masses in a precessing merger a not too high final spin can be considered typical .",
    "\\b ) the mass ratio is in the range @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the orbital angular momentum dominates over the spin only at the beginning of the inspiral , and as such is roughly aligned with the total angular momentum . at the end of the inspiral",
    "however the orbital angular momentum becomes smaller than the dominant spin , which has therefore to be reoriented towards the invariant total angular momentum direction . for precessing mergers",
    "this process causes a spin - flip during the inspiral , but does not reduce significantly the magnitude of the dominant spin @xcite , spinflip2 .",
    "non - precessing mergers on the other hand already imply an alignment of the spins and orbital angular momentum , therefore neither the spin magnitude , nor its direction will be changed by this process . in both cases ,",
    "whatever happens to the orbital angular momentum during the plunge , its small value ( compared to the dominant spin ) at the end of the inspiral will obstruct any serious further change in the final spin .    in this mass ratio range therefore the magnitude of the dominant spin will not be much reduced by the merger , nevertheless a significant reorientation of its direction during the inspiral will typically occur for precessing mergers , which could be followed only by a minor further spin - flip during the plunge .",
    "\\c ) the mass ratio is less than @xmath0 .",
    "then the orbital angular momentum is too small from the beginning of the inspiral to modify the dominant spin . neither its magnitude , nor its direction are affected and we practically face the inspiral of a test mass into the much larger black hole .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the merger process , based on the recent data of ref .",
    "we first derive the smbh mass distribution . in section [ massratio ]",

    "we note that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are fully consistent with earlier results based on much smaller statistics @xcite .",
    "next we derive in section [ finalspin ] a simple approximant for the final spin of the emerging smbh , as function of the mass ratio , initial spin magnitudes , and orientation of the spins with respect to the orbital plane . in the appendix",
    "we compare the approximant with the more cumbersome expressions existing in the literature , which were obtained by fit to numerical simulations .    in subsection [ dry ]",
    "we adopt the configuration of precessing mergers , which allow for all relative spin and orbital angular momentum orientations on equal footing , lowering the chances for a large final spin after the merger . by integrating over all orientations in the precessing merger limit ( without allowing any preference for alignment ) , for any initial spin",
    "set we determine a lower approximant to the final spin distribution as function of the mass ratio alone . by folding this with the previously derived mass ratio dependent merger rate ,",
    "we obtain a _ lower bound to the typical final spin _ after smbh mergers .",
    "by contrast , in the non - precessing merger limit there is a perfect alignment of the spins with the orbital angular momentum , hence the integration should be carried on for this configuration alone , and only over the mass ratios , folded with the mass ratio distribution . by this method , in subsection wet we get an _ upper bound for the typical final spin_.    we discuss the implications of our results and present the concluding remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in ref . @xcite we gave a simple preliminary estimate of the typical mass ratio of merging smbhs .",
    "we revisit the problem more rigorously here , both from a mathematical point of view and by employing new , more precise data on smbh masses , presented in ref .",
    "we do note that selection effects strongly influence some statistical arguments , in the case , that selection is based on detectable activity at the center of a galaxy for instance , on a far - infrared or ultra - violet excess ; in the first case this could be due to selecting for central emission lines , in the second due to a central star - burst , and in the third to a visible central accretion disk .",
    "our approach , taken in this paper , does suffer from the selection effect , that the work done by carametebiermann used the colors of an old stellar population as the starting point , and then cut the sample to include only early hubble type galaxies .",
    "however , allowing for a sample of late hubble type galaxies would not increase the merger rate very much , since such galaxies usually suffer few if any mergers @xcite .       and @xmath30 , the breakpoint being at @xmath31m@xmath6 .",

    "however the changed mass values imply more cases to be included in the analysis .",
    "the number of encounters for a given mass ratio @xmath63 , represented as @xmath64 is proportional to the product of the distribution functions for both black holes , folded with the merger probability @xmath65 and integrated over the mass @xmath66 of the smaller black hole : : @xmath67the merger probability in turn is proportional to the cross section ( we neglect the weak dependence on the relative velocity of galaxies as these are not too high , the universe being not old enough for mass segregation ) .    in order to determine the cross section , we assume that each galaxy merger is followed by the merger of their central smbhs",
    ". therefore we basically evaluate the cross section of merging galaxies .",
    "further , we note that the masses of the galaxies and their central smbhs correlate due to    * the correlation of the mass of the central smbh with the mass of the host galactic bulge @xcite , * the proportionality of the mass of the central smbh with both the spheroidal galaxy mass component and the total mass ( including dark matter ) of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the more massive smbh , thus the most massive galaxy dominates the cross section , thus the merger rate @xmath65 . as the cross section is a function of the galaxy mass ( thus smbh mass ) , we take @xmath68 .",
    "we chose @xmath69  based on the following observation :    * the comparison of our galaxy with dwarf spheroidals shows that an increase by a factor of @xmath70 in radius ( thus @xmath71 in cross section )  is accompanied by an increase by a factor of @xmath72 in mass @xcite-@xcite .    the break point @xmath73 splits the smbh range into two intervals , encompassing a mass range of about a factor of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "the final spin is @xmath158 , much higher than for precessing mergers , however still reduced essentially as compared to the initial spin values .",
    "in this paper we have studied the typical mass ratio and the typical final spin in a two - body system composed of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) , thus we did not consider the perturbations induced by either of the accretion disks , nearby stellar population , magnetic fields or jets .",
    "smbhs reside in the center of each galaxy and following the frequent galaxy mergers they also merge .",
    "various dissipative processes , like dynamical friction , accretion and emitted gravitational radiation are responsible to their gradual approach and finally gravitational radiation is which drives them to coalescence through a sequence of inspiral , merger and ringdown .    by starting from precise and new data on the smbh mass distribution we derived both a differential and an integral mass function , shown on fig .",
    "fig_bh . the differential mass function is a broken power law , with coefficients @xmath159 and @xmath30 , with the breakpoint at @xmath160 m@xmath161 .",
    "then , exploiting a number of simple and reasonable assumptions we derived the mass ratio dependent probability of encounters of two such smbhs , represented on fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] .",
    "this confirms our expectation that the most frequent ( approximately half of the ) encounters are for mass ratios @xmath162 to @xmath0 , the interesting mass ratio range where a spin - flip would occur during the inspiral @xcite .     as function of @xmath163 only , in the randomly precessing and the non - precessing merger limits ( lower and upper curves , respectively ) .",
    "the curves are obtained by integration over all mass ratios of the expressions ( [ spinfindry ] ) @xmath164 and ( [ spinfinwet ] ) @xmath165 , respectively , weighted with the mass ratio dependent probabilities of encounter ( [ n ] ) .",
    "the line of equal initial and final spins is also indicated . where this line crosses the final spin curves , there are two attractors ( denoted by large dots ) , to where the final spin would converge after a sequence of mergers in the two scenarios.,width=302 ]    next , based on certain well - founded assumptions we derived a simple analytical expression for the final spin of such a merger , depending on the mass ratio , initial spin magnitudes , and orientation of the spins with respect to the orbital plane and each other .",
    "this formula approximates well more cumbersome expressions obtained from the fit with numerical simulations , and it is much simpler , thus advantageous in order to carry on the cumbersome numerical integrations which followed .",
    "we proceeded to find the typical final spin in two limiting and highly idealized scenarios .",
    "first we allowed for perfectly random orientations ( precessing case ) , over which we have integrated , obtaining a final spin still depending on the initial spin magnitudes and mass ratio .",
    "then we folded with the derived mass ratio dependent merger rate , we integrated over the mass ratio , deriving a lower bound to the typical final spin value after mergers .",
    "secondly we considered the non - precessing configuration , with all spins and the orbital angular momentum perfectly aligned .",
    "folding the final spin for this particular configuration again with the derived mass ratio dependent merger rate and integrating over the mass ratio we obtained an upper bound for the typical spin .",
    "these are represented as function of the initial spin magnitudes ( chosen to be equal will anyhow have but a small impact on the result , as the ratio of the _ total _ spins @xmath16 scales with the mass ratio squared . ] ) on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . a third curve , the line of equal initial and final spins is also indicated on the figure .",
    "the fact that both slopes of @xmath2 as function of the initial spins are smaller than one , leads to important consequences .",
    "if we imagine a sequence of idealized ( either randomly precessing or non - precessing ) mergers , what happens is that low spins tend to increase by mergers while high spins decrease .",
    "there are in fact two attractors at @xmath166 and @xmath5 , respectively , where the spins converge after a reasonable number of the two types of mergers .",
    "real mergers , biased toward partial alignment by interactions with the environment ( accretion , host galaxy , etc . ) would generate a typical final spin lying between these two limiting values .",
    "indeed , for example the galaxy group distribution around ngc383 looks like a spindle , with the spin of the central black hole in the dominant galaxy , ngc383 , aligned with the long axis of the spindle .",
    "this shows a correlation between the dominant galaxy black hole spin and the distribution of the other galaxies , all with central black holes as well .",
    "it is to be expected that the distribution of galaxies in the environment of a dominant galaxy is not random , but correlated , such that in a merger of a galaxy with the dominant galaxy the final spin , depending on the nature of the correlation , could fall anywhere between the two curves shown of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    after the merger episode gaseous accretion can start to increase the spin again .",
    "if gaseous accretion were strong , then the spin could become quite large in relatively short time .",
    "we propose to work out quantitatively such a model in a forthcoming work .",
    "this work has been realized in large part during two visits of lg at the institute of radioastronomy bonn , supported through stsm grants of the cost action mp0905 `` black holes in a violent universe '' .",
    "various papers have presented empirical formulae for the final spin , with the functional form partially motivated by pn expressions and coefficients fitted to the result of numerical runs . in one of the latest such works barausse and",
    "rezzola @xcite suggested a set of criteria i - v ) such a formula should obey .",
    "we compare this formula with our eq .",

    "the condition i ) of ref .",
    "@xcite implies no rest mass loss by gravitational radiation ; our lower spin limit estimate with @xmath167 does the same .",
    "condition iii ) assumes that the radiation loss in the last stage of the merger is along the direction of the total angular momentum , this property continuing to hold similarly as during the inspiral @xcite . by identifying @xmath2 with @xmath168",
    "we also assume that . similarly , this identification assures the validity of condition iv ) , which translates to no change in @xmath169 and @xmath170 during the plunge .",
    "however we note that in the strict sense the spin - spin and quadrupole - monopole couplings of the pn dynamics will obstruct this assumption ; therefore this assumption can not be considered valid for any distance , as assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless these angular evolutions are negligible on the orbital timescale , thus during the plunge ( over which we assume its validity and which lasts only from a fraction of an orbit to a few orbits ) the condition can be regarded as accurate",
    ". condition v. of ref .",
    "@xcite implies that the initial spins should drop out completely from the final spin formula in the particular case of equal masses and equal , but opposed spins .",
    "( [ spinfin ] ) can be specified for this configuration by inserting @xmath171 @xmath172 and @xmath173 and it gives @xmath174 , which is also independent of the initial spins .",
    "therefore condition v ) also holds .",
    "finally , condition ii ) assumes that there are three vectors with conserved length .",
    "these are the two spins ( that we also assume ) , and the vector @xmath175 ( what we do not ) .",
    "the latter condition in our notation implies @xmath176we can set the constant to @xmath177 by evaluating the formula at @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .",
    "note that @xmath180 thus it changes with @xmath181 , at keplerian order . for generic @xmath182",
    "we have @xmath2=const . and @xmath168 changing significantly only on the radiation timescale ( due to gravitational radiation ) . over the orbital timescale",
    "the change in @xmath168 by gravitational radiation backreaction is at 2.5pn orders , while over the precessional timescale is of 1pn order .",
    "the evolution of @xmath183 generates a 1pn change over the orbital timescale @xcite , therefore the leading order changes over the orbital timescale of the second and third terms in the second line on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) are of order @xmath184and @xmath185 .",
    "thus we conclude that condition ii ) concerning the constancy of the length of the vector @xmath186 can not be extended to arbitrary @xmath182 , as in fact changes with @xmath185 .    in the most generic case discussed in ref .",
