    "in its most general form , the dynamical state of the interior of a star is one of differential rotation and entropy stratification .",
    "if isobaric and isochoric surfaces do not coincide , the angular velocity need not be constant on cylinders . a noteable example is the sun , for which helioseismology studies have fashioned a remarkably detailed and rich portrait .",
    "where the sun is stably stratified in entropy , in the bulk of the radiative zone , it tends not to be differentially rotating .",
    "however , surrounding the radius of vanishing entropy gradient , in both the convective _ and _ radiative layers , there is significant differential rotation generally dominated by the radial component of the angular velocity gradient .",
    "higher in the convection zone , the rotation contours show an abrupt change in morphology , with the sudden emergence of a distinctly conical pattern ( e.g. miesch & toomre 2009 ) .",
    "finally , approaching the sun s surface , there is once again an abrupt shift in contour morphology , apparently associated with the onset of high - velocity convection .    in previous work ( balbus , latter , & weiss 2012 [ blw ] and references therein ) , it has been shown that the pattern of coaxial cones in the bulk of the solar convective zone ( scz ) can be understood as an elementary solution of the vorticity equation ( in the limit of thermal wind balance ) under certain well - posed assumptions .",
    "one of these assumptions is that a small angular entropy gradient is present , for without this there can be no axial component of the angular velocity gradient .",
    "where does this all - important entropy gradient come from ?",
    "is it , as is often argued , an ineluctable consequence of convection and the coriolis force , or is something more  or something else  involved ?",
    "for that matter , is the entropy gradient more or less fundamental than the concomitant angular velocity gradient ?    to address these questions , we begin with a very general study of the linear behavior of three - dimensional fluid displacements in a shearing and stratified background medium .",
    "the background angular velocity and entropy profiles may depend upon both poloidal coordinates .",
    "it is demonstrated that for a medium in uniform rotation , the most unstable displacements do _ not _ deflect from spherically radial paths , despite the presence of coriolis forces . when a axial component of the angular velocity gradient is _ already _ present however , it is shown that there is a significant polar deflection of higher entropy fluid elements .",
    "more precisely , the sense of this deflection is poleward for outward - moving displacements if the axial angular velocity gradient is negative ( as in the sun ) , and _ equatorial _ if this gradient is positive .",
    "thus , a axial angular angular velocity gradient is self - reinforcing , and may thus be reshaped , in a convective fluid .",
    "angular velocity gradients in cylindrical radius are much less effective in this regard : they have no first order effect on convective displacements . because a background axial angular velocity gradient requires a vorticity source , this has far reaching consequences , and we use this finding as a thin edge of wedge to pry further into the origins of the sun s baroclinic differential rotation .",
    "we argue in particular that it is likely that the rotation pattern of the scz has emerged by responding to a preexisting angular entropy gradient , rather than generating such a gradient internally .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the experience of numerical simulations , in which rotation on cylinders stubbornly persists unless latitudinal entropy boundary conditions are present , in which case solar - like profiles emerge relatively easily ( e.g. miesch , brun , toomre 2006 ) . indeed ,",
    "if the conclusions of this paper are well - founded , the direct imposition of such boundary conditions is the `` correct '' procedure !    in the second part of this paper , we put forth the case that vorticity generation is all but inevitable near the outer edge of the radiative zone where the entropy gradient vanishes .",
    "the combination of diffusive heating and centrifugal distortion of equipotential surfaces is incompatible with radiative and dynamical equilibrium in a uniformly rotating medium .",
    "the classic remedy of introducing a tiny amount of meridional circulation ( e.g. , schwarzschild 1958 ) breaks down at a surface of zero entropy gradient . instead ,",
    "radiative equilibrium is re - established with very slightly different isothermal and isochoric surfaces .",
    "if , as one would expect from radiative considerations , the isotherms are more spherical than the isochoric surfaces , an incipient tachocline is generated , bearing many of the features observed of the true solar tachocline : a negative axial gradient of the angular velocity everywhere , a dominant ( spherical ) radial component of this gradient , and an increasingly dominant cylindrical disposition of the isorotation contours toward the equator .",
    "the generation of vorticity at a level stemming from the centrifugal distortion of the equipotential surfaces has not been hitherto viewed as an important component of the solar differential rotation profile .",
    "however , not only is the centrifugal distortion of precisely the correct order - of - magnitude for this problem , we are argue that it is the principal causal agent . if this is correct , numerical simulations whose goal is to reproduce the sun s internal rotation accurately from first principles will ultimately have to accomodate this @xmath0 effect .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we present the governing equations for three - dimensional fluid displacements in an axisymmetric but otherwise fully general entropy - stratified , shearing background .",
    "this is an interesting gasdynamical problem in its own right , and particularly relevant for the sun .",
    "general solutions are presented in  3 , but we focus on the most rapidly growing modes , for which a simple analysis is possible .",
    "the solution shows explicitly the relationship between shear , coriolis forces , and the deflection of convective trajectories . in  4 , we integrate our findings with standard solar models , arguing that the seed angular entropy gradient is a result of centrifugal distortion of equipotential surfaces in the radiative zone together with the disappearance of the entropy gradient at the scz boundary . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our results .",
    "throughout this paper , we use standard cylindrical coordinates ( with @xmath1 the radial distance from the rotation axis , @xmath2 the azimuthal angle , and @xmath3 the distance along the rotation axis ) and standard spherical coordinates ( with @xmath4 the radial distance from the origin , @xmath5 the colatitude angle from the @xmath3 axis , and @xmath2 the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "unit vectors will be denoted by an appropriately subscripted @xmath6 .",
    "the unperturbed background state is one of time - steady hydrostatic equilibrium , [ one ] r^2 = 1 p + here , @xmath7 is the angular velocity , @xmath8 the mass density , @xmath9 the gas pressure , and @xmath10 the gravitational potential .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath11 is assumed to be weak and may be ignored in the equilibrium state , but large wavenumber perturbations could in principle be significantly influenced by the field .",
    "we therefore will retain the magnetic field when analyzing small disturbances .",
    "equation ( [ one ] ) is quite general for hydrostatic stars or disks , but for scz applications it is an excellent approximation to take @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the newtonian constant and @xmath14 is one solar mass ) , and to ignore the centrifugal force in the equilibrium state .",
    "the centrifugal term can of course never be ignored in the vorticity equation ( the @xmath2 component of the curl of equation [ [ one ] ] ) , which provides a measure of the departure of isobaric and isochoric surfaces : r^2z = 1 ^ 2 ( rpz - zpr ) , which may also be written [ vor ] r^2z = 1 ( zpr - rpz ) where @xmath15 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath16 is proportional to the specific entropy .",
    "the right side of ( [ vor ] ) may be written in spherical coordinates as [ vor2 ] r^2z = 1r ( rp - pr ) where @xmath17 is an excellent approximation to the gravitational acceleration , and the final approximate equality assumes that the radial component of the entropy gradient does _ not _ exceed the latitudinal component by many orders of magnitude .",
    "equation ( [ vor2 ] ) , often referred to as the thermal wind equation ( e.g. pedlosky 1987 ) , appears to be well satisfied throughout much of the scz .      to understand more fully the complex dynamics of the scz",
    ", we analyze here a much simpler proxy system : the local linear behavior of three - dimensional linear disturbances in weakly magnetized , stratified , differentially rotating , two - dimensional background flows .",
    "note that although the equilibrium is axisymmetric , the disturbances are fully three - dimensional .",
    "our focus is the temporal behavior of the fluid displacements embedded in such a medium .",
    "nonlinear convection generally involves coherent , extended structures .",
    "a local wkb treatment can not hope to capture fully this element of the problem . instead , by affording some insight as to how uniformly rotating surfaces",
    "arise and host convective displacements , the local theory can suggest the origin of structure on larger scales .",
    "such structure is able to survive despite the presence of shear .",
    "the fundamental dynamical equation of motion for the linear perturbations is + ( ) + 1 ( p + b^28 ) + - ( ) 4 = 0 . as noted ,",
    "while the magnetic field @xmath11 is assumed to play no role in the equilibrium state , it can still be important for the evolution of large wavenumber perturbations , and will be retained .",
    "we wish to explore the nonaxisymmetric behavior of local disturbances . because the background flow is in a state of differential rotation , we work in a locally shearing lagrangian coordinate system , and the linear perturbations are ultimately to be expressed in terms of the lagrangian fluid element displacement @xmath18 .",
    "begin by taking standard eulerian perturbations ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . ) of the usual fluid equations .",
    "the linearized equation of motion is [ linear ] d  dt + ( ) -^2 p + ( p + 4 ) - ( ) 4 = 0 , where = t + is the lagrangian time derivative associated with the unperturbed flow .",
    "the magnetic pressure buoyancy term and the magnetic tension term involving the gradient of the background magnetic field have been dropped under the assumption that the field is weak .",
    "we make the standard wkb assumption that the product of the perturbation wavenumber with any background scale height is large .",
    "consider the first two terms of equation ( [ linear ] ) , + ( ) + + ( ) ( r ) the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of these terms are , respectively , [ r1 ] = dv_rdt -2 v _ , [ phi1 ] = dv_dt + ^22 v_r + r(z)v_z , where ^2 = 2 .",
    "the @xmath3 component is simply = dv_zdt .",
    "the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is given by [ dxidt ] d dt = + ( r ) for @xmath23 equal to @xmath1 or @xmath3 , we find @xmath24 , while the @xmath2 component of ( [ dxidt ] ) gives = v_+ r ( ) equations ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ phi1 ] ) may now be expressed in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , becoming respectively = _ r - 2_+ r ( ) ^2 , = _ + 2_r , where the dot notation indicates the lagrangian derivative @xmath27 . putting the last two equations together with the @xmath3 equation of motion leads to the vector equation + ( ) = + 2 + r ( ) ^2 the second term on the right is obviously the coriolis term , and the final term is the `` residual centrifugal force : '' the difference between the centrifugal force in the rotating frame and the forces maintaing the differential rotation .",
    "notice the appearance of @xmath28 , as opposed to an angular momentum gradient , as part of the inertial forces .",
    "next , recall the relationship between @xmath29 and the displacement @xmath21 , which follows from the integrated form of the induction equation , [ curl ] = ( ) we work in the boussinesq limit , = 0 , so that equation ( [ curl ] ) becomes =( ) .",
    "we have dropped the term @xmath30 under the wkb assumption that the displacements are rapidly varying in space .",
    "finally , for adiabatic perturbations , = , since in the boussinesq limit , the relative pressure perturbation @xmath31 is small compared with the relative density perturbation @xmath32 .",
    "the final step is to transform to spatial lagrangian coordinates comoving with the unperturbed flow , the `` primed '' coordinate system .",
    "this is accomplished by the transformation r=r , ",
    "= -t , z=z , t=t , where of course @xmath7 is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "use of the lagrangian derivative @xmath27 ( @xmath33 ) has already effected the transformation of the partial time derivative , and the two altered poloidal spatial derivatives are =  r -t r   , =  z -t z  . more compactly , = ",
    "-(t )   , a relation that holds for all three components of the gradient . in the wkb limit ,",
    "all disturbances in lagrangian comoving coordinates have the spatial dependence in which all components of the @xmath34 wave vector are constants .",
    "this means that the eulerian spatial derivatives of @xmath1 and @xmath3 are replaced locally ( and respectively ) by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where k_r(t ) = k_r -mtr , k_z(t ) = k_z -mtz henceforth , the time dependence of @xmath37 and @xmath38 will be understood with k_r = -mr , k_z = -mz .",
    "note that for initially purely azimuthal @xmath39 disturbances , the poloidal wavenumber components comprise a two - dimensional vector parallel to @xmath40 .      at sufficiently large times @xmath41 ( or all times",
    "if @xmath42 ) , [ krkz ] k_rk_z and the wave vector becomes increasingly axisymmetric as the poloidal components grow .",
    "if the three components of the displacement @xmath21 are of comparable magnitude , then the condition @xmath43 becomes , at sufficiently large @xmath41 , = 0 , whence = 0 . in other words ,",
    "_ independently of the details of the dynamics , _ the velocity vector of a disturbed fluid element must eventually lie in a surface of constant @xmath7 .",
    "there is nothing `` solar '' about this argument , it relies entirely on the kinematics of differential rotation and mass conservation in an incompressible fluid .",
    "but it is tempting to apply this to the sun , since the fluid elements in question would then be convecting heat and eliminating excess entropy gradients within surfaces of constant @xmath7 , and the confluence of these surfaces with constant residual entropy surfaces becomes less mysterious .",
    "there is a further benefit to such an approach : the preponderance of the constant @xmath7 surfaces are _ observed _ to be quasi - radial spokes , as seen in merdional cross section .",
    "they are customarily if crudely described as cones of constant @xmath5 . if the radially convecting elements are compelled to follow paths of constant @xmath7 , then @xmath44 is hardly mysterious .",
    "( precisely the same vanishing - divergence reasoning also leads to the conclusion that the poloidal components of the magnetic field vector should lie in constant @xmath7 surfaces . )",
    "is this kinematical argument for the alignment of constant residual entropy and angular velocity surfaces correct ?",
    "this depends upon whether there is sufficient time for the shear to shape the wavelet before coherence is lost .",
    "a potential difficulty is that , as the differential rotation is not large , this may be a rather long time interval depending upon the initial poloidal wavenumber components .",
    "long - lived , coherent , nonlinear and nonlocal structures are seen in fully - developed convection , and these will in fact tend to lie in constant @xmath7 surfaces .",
    "in some sense this backs our approach , but at the same time it puts the cart before the horse : it is just this rotation - entropy link we would like to understand .",
    "we suggest that a more rapid linear dynamical explanation is also available , whereby modes with very small initial poloidal wavenumbers and near radial displacements are preferred for rapid development .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in  2.6 and  3 .",
    "the @xmath2 component of the equilibrium magnetic field is not independent of time , but satisfies the induction equation = r ( ) , or b_=",
    "b_+ tr ( ) .",
    "note , however , that the magnetic tension @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the magnetic field at @xmath48 , is _ independent of time .",
    "_ introducing the alfvn velocity , the quantity @xmath49 , the local magnetic tension force per unit mass , may be regarded as a locally constant parameter in the equations of motion .",
    "we may now assemble the three fundamental dynamical equations of motion : [ xir ] _",

    "the three dynamical equation may be combined into a single vectorial equation [ legrand ] + 2 + r ( ) ^2 - p + ( ) ^2 + i ( p + 4)=0 with the understanding that @xmath50 in the final term is time dependent , ( t ) = ( 0 ) - mt , and = 0 .",
    "it is a curious and significant fact that in the bulk of the convective zone the sun tends to eliminate every extraneous _ nonconvective _ term in the linear equation ( [ legrand ] ) , either by the term vanishing identically or by its cancellation with another nonconvective term .",
    "the dominant dynamics is due almost entirely to the underlying radial forcing from the unstable entropy gradient , even in the presence of rotation .",
    "recall the concept of residual entropy introduced by balbus et al.(2009 ) : the entropy @xmath51 is written as the sum of a function depending only upon spherical radius , @xmath52 , and a residual term , @xmath53 .",
    "physically , @xmath54 represents the underlying convection - driving unstable radial entropy profile , and @xmath55 is the @xmath5-dependent modification that results as a consequence of rotation plus convection . in numerical simulations ,",
    "this breakdown has an operational significance : @xmath54 is externally imposed , and @xmath55 is , in essence , the computed reponse ( miesch et al .",
    "may acquire a purely spherical contribution as well , but this is easily removed by subtracting off the mean .",
    "] only @xmath55 is relevant to the thermal wind equation ( [ vor2 ] ) , since the entropy appears exclusively in the form of @xmath56 .",

    "moreover , surfaces of constant @xmath7 and @xmath55 coincide well ( miesch et al . 2006 ; balbus et al .",
    "2009 ) . under these circumstances , for the dominant radial @xmath61 convective displacements , _ all terms in equation ( [ legrandr ] ) vanish , cancel hydrostatically , or are otherwise negligible , _ save the first and second .",
    "in particular , the coriolis deflection ( third term in from the left ) is balanced by the azimuthal pressure gradient ( final term on the left side ) , and the two @xmath62 terms are are intrinsically small .",
    "the radially moving disturbances disturbances are characterized by poloidal wavenumber components very small compared with @xmath63 . in other words , within the context of simple linear theory in a uniformly rotating sphere , we have a plausible beginning for understanding why the sun s gross pattern of _ differential rotation _ is the way it is : the most efficient way to convect heat outwards is by maintaining radial convection , which is however permitted only to the extent that the dynamical forces of differential rotation allow it . with @xmath64 , and fluid motions",
    "embedded within coinciding @xmath7 and @xmath55 surfaces , the dynamics of radial covection in a shearing system is self - consistent .",

    "the angular deflections of convective displacements from linear theory are very similar in magnitude to the observed departures of the iso-@xmath7 surfaces from constant @xmath5 cones in the bulk of the scz .",
    "this , we suggest , is no coincidence : convection and its hallmark of constant residual entropy are both intimately associated with constant @xmath7 surfaces in the bulk of the scz ( blw ) , and a poleward deflection of the fluid elements is unavoidable when @xmath65 .",
    "the interesting point , as we have earlier noted , is that it seems there must be an external source of vorticity in place to drive the deflections .",
    "we next consider exact numerical solutions of equations ( [ ddotxir ] ) and ( [ ddotxiz ] ) .",

    "we integrate equations ( [ ddotxir ] ) and ( [ ddotxiz ] ) for a variety of different initial velocities and wavenumbers .",
    "our strategy is to choose initial wavenumbers lying in the plane tangent to @xmath90 , with a random initial velocity direction ( perpendicular to the wavenumber ) , and an initial displacement of zero .",
    "the ensuing trajectories are then followed .",
    "when the angular velocity is uniform and free of shear , the results are very simple : all trajectories rapidly become radial , regardless of their initial condition . in agreement with our analytic treatment , after a brief initial transient , there is no equatorial or poleward deflection , even with the coriolis force . on the other hand , when an angular velocity profile is used that has been modeled with the helioseismology data ,",

    "the entropy flux aligns itself with the isorotation surfaces within a typical mixing time .",
    "see text for further details.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] [ sunslice ]    figure ( 1 ) shows this effect clearly .",
    "we work at @xmath111 , at latitudes @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . at each latitude ,",
    "the surface of the local isorotation curve is shown , edge - on in a meridional plane , by a dotted red line .",
    "the local radial direction is shown by the black dotted line .",
    "the colored solid line at each latitude is the direction of the local _ eulerian _ perturbation velocity , projected in the meridional plane .",
    "four different times are shown . in each case",

    "near the pole  above @xmath117the trajectories begin and remain northward of the local iosortation surface , becoming more so with time . here , the problem becomes close to one - dimensional , with all flow quantities predominantly a function of @xmath3 .",
    "our fundamental assumption that there is a functional relationship between angular velocity and residual entropy is then a matter of mathematical symmetry , not dynamics .",
    "the torques required to maintain the fluid elements in or near surfaces of constant angular velocity are provided by azimuthal pressure gradients , as previously noted .",
    "_ in no sense is the angular momentum of an individual fluid element conserved .",
    "_ consider however @xmath118 , the eulerian perturbation of the angular velocity : v_= _ -(r ) = -r(k_r_r+k__)/m , where we have used equation ( [ xiphidot ] ) in the last equality , and switched to spherical coordinates .",
    "the wavenumber component @xmath119 is very small in the bulk of the scz since it is proportional to @xmath120 and @xmath44 .",
    "the term @xmath121 term is quadratic in the @xmath7 gradients , thus also a very small quantity .",
    "therefore , there is very little angular momentum transport propagated by the correlated fluctuation tensor component @xmath122 . indeed , noting that if equation ( [ pee64 ] ) holds for the poloidal wavenumber components , then v_=-r(k_r_r+k__)/m = rt , which for a near vanishing @xmath118 is a self - consistent indication that displacements do not stray from constant @xmath7 surfaces .",
    "angular momentum could , in principle , still be directly advected by a nonvanishing poloidal mass flux , if one is present .",
    "the linear behaviour of perturbations in a two - dimensional , stratified , differentially rotating medium is very different according to whether or not @xmath7 is dependent upon @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath7 depends only upon @xmath1 , isobaric and isochoric surfaces coincide , there is no source of baroclinic vorticity , and the dominant convective displacements are radial .",
    "there is neither poleward nor equatorial bias in the heat transport .",
    "if @xmath7 depends upon @xmath3 , isobaric and isochoric surfaces do not coincide , an explicit vorticity source is implicated , and outward moving , hotter convective displacements deflect north or south depending upon whether @xmath7 respectively decreases or increases poleward .",
    "the helioseismology data in the bulk of the scz are in accord with this description , with @xmath123 and slightly upward cants to the constant @xmath7 surfaces .",
    "the question remains , however , of what the cause of this gradient is .",
    "indeed , it is a classical case of begging the question : the fundamental angular entropy gradient , putatively arising from the interaction of rotation and convection , itself requires the prexistence of an axial @xmath7 gradient  the very gradient the angular entropy gradient is supposed to be explaining !    in the next section , we suggest a resolution to this problem .",
    "it has long been known that a uniformly rotating star can not simultaneously be both in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. schwarzschild 1958 ) .",
    "the difficulty is that the rotation induces centrifugal distortions of the isothermal surfaces ",
    "polar flattening and equatorial bulging  which are incompatible with a vanishing radiative flux divergence .",
    "the dimensionless number that sets the scale for these distortions is the centrifugal parameter , which for a ( fictional ) uniformly rotating sun takes the value : _ 0 = r_^3 ^2gm _ ~1.610 ^ -5 .",
    "( we have used @xmath124 . )",
    "this is a very small number .",
    "but we are interested in entropy gradients of order ~10 ^ -6 , and it therefore behooves us to take note of centrifugally - induced angular gradients .    normally , a tiny amount of meridional circulation is enough to offset the unbalanced radiative heating .",
    "consider , however , conditions at the outer edge of the radiative zone . the entropy equation is p = -(-1 ) , where @xmath125 is the radiative flux .",
    "if the divergence term on the right does not vanish at the radius where the entropy gradient does , there is no simple balance of the right and left sides of the equation .",
    "a balance could in principle be restored if a turbulent entropy flux divergence were present , and this may indeed be representative of current conditions , but it is revealing to follow the breakdown of our simple uniform rotation model .",
    "uneven heating would alter the flux until its divergence is minmized .",
    "( the time scale for this is simply the kelvin - helmholtz time ; @xmath126 is not involved . )",
    "this altered flux divergence will generally be incompatible with coincidence of isobaric and isochoric surfaces , which uniform rotation demands .",
    "we are thus led to the generation of differential rotation with an axial component of the angular velocity gradient ( baroclinicity ) to maintain thermal equilibrium . even in a more complex setting with a thermal entropy flux divergence present",
    ", the base of the convective zone will follow the the radiation flux divergence and almost certainly be more spherical than the equipotential surfaces .",
    "once again baroclinic structure will be generated .",
    "the helioseismology data show unambiguously that the radius at which the entropy gradient vanishes is symmetrically placed within a narrow band of pronounced differential rotation : the tachocline . moving from this radius downward into the radiative zone ,",
    "uniform rotation takes over as the entropy gradient rises rapidly and meridional circulation is established . moving upward into the convective zone , turbulent mixing quickly develops and there is an abrupt change of the character of the differential rotation : convective mixing leads at once to the coincidence of two important classes of surface , but not a coincidence that is compatible with uniform rotation .",
    "rather , it is isorotational and residual entropy surfaces that now coincide .",
    "( note the hidden but important role of nonaxisymmetry , as the convective modes are large @xmath74 disturbances . )",
    "turbulent convection , in this picture , does not generate `` from scratch '' the differential rotation in which it operates .",
    "instead it reacts to , and reinforces , the angular velocity gradient bequeathed to it from the surface of vanishing entropy gradient .",
    "we suggest that this is a key ingredient to the organizational scheme of differential rotation in the sun .",
    "the centrifugal distortion of equipotential surfaces engendered by uniform rotation leaves temperature @xmath127 , pressure @xmath9 and density @xmath8 functions of @xmath128 $ ] , where @xmath129 is the usual legendre polynomial of second order , and @xmath130 is a function only of radius @xmath4 ( of order @xmath126 ) .",
    "the function @xmath130 is determined by the solving the poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions ( schwarzschild 1958 ) . at first glance",
    "it might be thought that the effect of vorticity generation and its differing iso - surfaces would be to create a distinct @xmath130 for each structural variable : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , etc .",
    "in fact , when vorticity is generated it is impossible to satisfy basic rotational equilibrium without a @xmath133 dependence in the _ leading order _ nonspherical structure of these variables .",
    "the equation of rotational equilibrium is r^2 = 1 p + where @xmath7 depends upon @xmath4 and @xmath5 . from the symmetry of our problem",
    "we would expect @xmath97 to be of the form ^2 = _ 0(r)^2",
    "+ q_2(r ) p_2 ( ) + q_4(r ) p_4 ( ) + ... where the @xmath134 are functions of @xmath4 only .",
    "this is not necessarily an expansion in a small parameter , but for the region of interest the first two term provide a very good approximation , with errors in @xmath135 about @xmath136% very near the equator and less elsewhere rather than @xmath97 ; the latter turns out to have a simpler expansion near the tachocline boundary .",
    "see gough [ 2007 ] for convenient parameterizations of @xmath7 . ] .",
    "the average of @xmath97 is the average of @xmath137 and will be denoted @xmath138 .",
    "then , we may write the force balance equation as [ bar1 ] r(^2- ) = 1 p +  where = -r^22 taking the divergence of equation ( [ bar1 ] ) , = ( 1 p ) + 4g- 2 or ( r + r   ) = ( 1 p ) + 4g- 2 from the form of this equation , it is evident that if @xmath97 has terms through order @xmath139 in its angular expansion , then @xmath8 and @xmath9 will in general have angular structure through @xmath140 in the first order linear term of a small @xmath126 expansion .",
    "therefore , uniform rotation results in quadrupolar deformation of the iso - surfaces of all structural variables , whereas a simple @xmath141 latitudinal dependence of @xmath97 results in _ octopolar _ structure .    consider a scenario in which the sun is rotating uniformly .",
    "there are @xmath129 distortions of iso - surfaces in the radiative zone , and no polar deflections of warm fluid elements in the convective zone .",
    "baroclinic vorticity would then be produced at the radius of vanishing entropy gradient .",
    "were only @xmath129 structure to remain , the only self - consistent solution for the angular velocity would be @xmath142 .",
    "however , @xmath65 would now also be present , causing first order poleward deflections of warm convective elements .",
    "these results are very suggestive , and offer at least a heuristic approach to understanding the sun s poleward decreasing angular velocity profile . if @xmath123 is maintained through the tachocline into the bulk of the scz , in which convection largely eliminates the @xmath4 gradients of @xmath7 and @xmath55 , then @xmath143 must be positive . to justify these assumptions in detail ,",
    "however , one would need to know how angular momentum is transported and deposited by secondary flows ( meisch et al .",
    "2012 ) , and what is relative importance of vorticity forcing by nonconservative forces versus inertial vorticity conservation .",
    "these considerations , whose detailed origin lies outside the the scope of the current work , regulate the the @xmath5 dependence of the pressure , density , entropy , and ultimately the angular velocity .",
    "the above considerations suggest that we regard the @xmath8 ( for example ) as a function of the quantity r_r[1+_(r)f_(^2 ) ] , and similarly for @xmath9 and @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath144 functions are linear combinations of @xmath129 and @xmath145 , in general distinct for @xmath146 .",
    "( recall that in the numerical simulations described by miesch et al . (",
    "2006 ) , @xmath147 angular structure in the _ entropy _ was included as a boundary condition at the base of the convection zone . by far",

    "d_0dr f_(^2 ) , with similar results for @xmath9 and @xmath127 . the notation @xmath151 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath151 functions are thus a linear superposition of @xmath152 ( or if more convenient @xmath141 ) plus a constant term .    with this development ,",
    "the vorticity equation becomes [ exacto ] ^2z = 2 ( _ p f_p -_f_)1_0 r dp_0dr d_0dr .",
    "the demands of radiative equilibrium will require isothermal surfaces to be more spherical ( less distorted ) than are isochoric surfaces , whose centrifugal deformations are less critical to the heat flux .",
    "the pressure , being a product of @xmath8 and @xmath127 , would thus also be closer to spherically stratified than @xmath8 itself .",
    "a simple mathematical approximation that allows progress and respects the observational fundamentals is to assume that the @xmath153 stratification functions are the same for each variable , but that the @xmath130 functions differ in magnitude from one variable to the next : @xmath154 .",
    "we will also ignore the spatial variation of the @xmath130 within the tachocline boundary layer .",
    "these considerations lead to a vorticity equation of the form [ clunk ] ^2z = ar^4 ( ^2- ) where @xmath155 ( of order @xmath156 ) and @xmath157 ( of order unity ) are positive constants .",
    "we have assumed @xmath158 gravitational field and a @xmath159 dependence for @xmath160 .",
    "signs have been chosen so that @xmath94 is negative at non - equatorial latitudes , as indicated by the helioseismology data .",
    "another way to write this equation is [ clunk1 ] d^2 r = ar^4 ( ^2- ) where the characteristic derivative @xmath161 is taken along the path [ clunk2 ] r^2 ^ 2= constant   r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_0 in this form , the equation is close to the tachocline equation ( 19 ) of blw , which is `` correct '' ( in the sense that it agrees extremely well with the data ) , but derived from a completely different point of view .",
    "the sole difference in the two formalisms is that the @xmath162 derivative of blw is taken along the path [ clunk3 ] r^2 ^ 2= r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_0 + r_0 ^ 2(1 -r_0r ) where @xmath163 is a number of order unity .",
    "this is the characteristic path associated with the scz isorotation contours .",
    "how closely do the two approaches agree ?",
    "if @xmath97 is a given function @xmath164 at radius @xmath165 , then the solution of ( [ clunk1 ] ) and ( [ clunk2 ] ) is ^2 = _ 0 ^ 2(r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_0 ) + a ^r_r_0 ( r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_0r^6 - r^4 ) dr or ^2 = _ 0 ^ 2(r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2_0)+a^2_05 r_0 ^ 3 ( 1 - r_0 ^ 5r^5 ) -a3 r_0 ^ 3",
    "( 1- r_0 ^ 3r^3 ) next assume that ^2_0 _ 1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2_0 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are positive constants .",
    "( recall that this is an excellent approximation for the boundary of the tachocline . )",
    "using equation ( [ clunk2 ] ) and solving for the isorotation curves leads to [ 96er ] ^2= r_0 ^ 2r^2 ( + cf_31 + cf_5 ) where = ( ^2-_1 ^ 2)/ _ 2 ^ 2 , c = a/(_2 ^ 2 r_0 ^ 3 ) , f_j = ( 1/j)[1-(r_0/r)^j ] note that @xmath168 is numerically the same as @xmath169 ; @xmath170 is a number of order @xmath171 unity .    [ h ]    as can be seen in figure ( 2 ) , which shows our solution ( [ 96er ] ) next to the precise fit of blw , the essential features of our result are basically correct .",
    "we have embedded the tachocline solution inside the same convective envelope solution in both cases .",
    "the principal area of disagreement is the bifurcation zone , on one side of which the isorotation contours break toward the pole and on the other side toward the equator .",
    "this is clearly the region where a crude approximation of the right side of equation ( [ exacto ] ) is likely to be most inaccurate .",
    "our approach to the tachocline structure makes it more clear why the blw equation works so well .",
    "an uncertain approximation used by blw was the extension of the same simple functional dependence between @xmath55 and @xmath97 into the tachocline .",
    "but in the region of interest near the bifurcation point , the tachocline solution really does become a smooth extension of the scz ( and the tachocline belies its name ) .",
    "away from the bifurcation zone , the functional dependence hardly matters , as it affects only the subdominant @xmath143 term in the governing equation .",
    "the main point that one should take away from this exercise is that the combination of direct vorticity forcing together with a proper reckoning of the octopolar distortions of the stuctural variables @xmath9 and @xmath8 caused by the centrifugal forces of even the simplest latitude - dependence of the angular velocity seem to be important components of the rotational profile of the tachocline .",
    "the current work combines two very different types of calculation , linking the linear dynamics of the convective zone to the origins of solar differential rotation and vorticity .",
    "we begin with the second part first .",
    "we have argued that the centrifugal distortion of equipotential surfaces combined with demands of thermal equilibrium requires the cleaving of isobaric and isochoric surfaces , and is likely to be the underlying cause of the sun s differential rotation .",
    "current numerical simulations are not designed to capture a process in which an order @xmath172 radiative effect is turned into relative angular velocity gradients of order @xmath173 .",
    "it may well be possible , however , to devise other computational schemes tailored to working with this point - of - view .",
    "an important technical point is that the tachocline pressure and density ( and therefore entropy ) must have both @xmath174 and @xmath133 angular structure .",
    "although this in itself is not a particularly new result , neither has it been widely appreciated , and we have exploited it in a rather novel manner . with @xmath145 and @xmath129 structure in place , not only may one understand the simple form of the vorticity equation in the tachocline , with reasonable approximations one may explicitly solve the equation .",
    "an important parameter of this equation , namely the precise angle at which @xmath175 changes sign , is probably determined by minimizing the torque on the radiative interior . finally , it is interesting to note that roxburgh ( 2001 ) calculated the sun s multipole moments using models based on helioseismic inversions .",
    "he found that the size of the octopole term @xmath176 was comparable to the _ change _ in the quadrupole term @xmath177 when differential rotation was included .",
    "this is what one would expect if differential rotation were _ modifying _ @xmath129 and _ creating _",
    "@xmath145 angular structures .    in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we have carried out a very general lagrangian linear calculation of the fluid displacements in an arbitrary , magnetized , two - dimensional background , stratified in both @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . applied to conditions appropriate to the scz ,",
    "in the absence of a background @xmath178 gradient , we find no poleward deflection of hot convective fluid elements .",
    "such an effect is sometimes invoked to produce an angular entropy gradient which would in turn lead to differential rotation via thermal wind balance .",
    "although there is nothing in our calculations that would prohibit the emergence of the required gradients in @xmath7 and @xmath3 at nonlinear order in a turbulent fluid , it is some significance that the dominant leading order linear response is completely different depending upon whether @xmath178 is present or absent .",
    "when a finite @xmath178 is _ a priori _ present , there are reinforcing convective deflections : a negative axial @xmath7 gradient , in particular , engenders poleward deflections of warmer fluid elements , which via thermal wind balance strengthen and maintain this same @xmath7 gradient .",
    "the presence or absence of background baroclinic vorticity is thus mirrored in the leading behavior of convective displacements .",
    "the actual generation of baroclinic vorticity may well lie outside the realm of convection dynamics .",
    "we propose that a vorticity source will inevitably appear at the location of a vanishing entropy gradient . in general , because of the effects centrifugal flattening , the constraints of thermal and dynamical equilibrium will force different iso - surfaces for density , temperature , and pressure .",
    "this must lead to an axial angular velocity gradient . by making some simplifying but plausible approximations ,",
    "one may calculate a time - steady solution of the vorticity equation for the angular velocity .",
    "this explicit solution yields a tachocline structure that certainly resembles the observations , and bears comparison with an earlier , more accurate , but also more phenomenological , calculation ( blw ) . with the onset of fully developed convection , surfaces of constant angular velocity and residual entropy",
    "coincide , and the character of the isorotation contours takes on the classical conical form well - known from helioseismology .",
    "the strength of this view of the origin of solar differential is that it emerges from just a few rather simple and largely inevitable processes : the demands of thermal energy balance in a rotating system ( which creates a baroclinic axial gradient of @xmath7 at the radiative / convective boundary ) , the kinematics of shear ( which , via embedded wavenumbers , incorporates @xmath7 gradients into the response of the fluid displacements ) , and the linear dynamics of convection ( which causes poleward displacements of entropy bearing fluid elements ) .",
    "while direct numerical simulation of this scenario is likely to be very challenging , it may well be possible to design a test - of - principle proxy system .",

    "to recover the axisymmetric limit of equations ( [ ddotxir ] ) and ( [ ddotxiz ] ) , we begin with their equivalent forms ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) : [ ibis ] _ r + ( ) ^2_r -k_rk_z(_z + ( ) ^2_z ) + 2rm ( k_r_r+k_z_z ) + dp ( ) = 0 , @xmath67 + \\left ( { rk_z\\over m}+{m\\over rk_z}\\right ) \\left[\\ddot\\xi_z + ( { {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$k\\cdot v_a$ } }   }   } ) ^2\\xi_z\\right ] \\qquad\\ \\ \\ \\qquad\\ \\ \\ \\qquad\\ \\ \\ \\qquad\\ \\ \\ \\qquad\\ \\ \\ \\qquad\\ \\ \\ ] ] [ iibis ] -2 ( r ) + mrk_z pz ( ) = 0 , in the axisymmetric @xmath179 limit , equation ( [ ibis ] ) may be written [ aone ] 2rm ( k_r_r + k_z_z ) + k^2k_z^2 + dp ( ) = 0 , in what follows , we will also require the twice differentiated form of this equation , [ atwo ] 2rm ( k_r ^iii_r + k_z ^iii_z ) -2r ^2 + k^2k_z^2 + dp ( ) = 0 , where the notation @xmath180 and @xmath181 denotes three and four time differentiations , respectively .",
    "only the leading order terms in a small @xmath74 expansion have been retained .",
    "now , in the axisymmetric limit , equation ( [ iibis ] ) becomes [ athree ] rm ( k_r_r + k_z_z)+ ( ) ^2 rm ( k_r_r + k_z_z)- 2 ( r)=0 differentiating once , [ aiv ] rm ( k_r^iii_r + k^iii_z_z)+ ( ) ^2 rm ( k_r_r + k_z_z ) -r - 2 ( r)=0 .",
    "the axisymmetric dispersion relation now follows from substituting equations ( [ aone ] ) and ( [ atwo ] ) for the @xmath182 terms into equation ( [ aiv ] ) , setting @xmath183 , and replacing all time derivatives by @xmath184 . (",
    "the sign is chosen so that a positive wavenumber has a positive phase velocity . ) after algebraic simplification , the result is ^4 + ^2- 4 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 = 0 , ^2 = ^2 - ( ) ^2 , where @xmath185 is defined in equation ( [ deq ] ) .",
    "this is in precise agreement with balbus ( 1995 ) ."
