    "we based our analysis on the model by @xcite , which holds for a bulge of @xmath1 . in order to analyse bulges of different masses",
    ", we chose to keep the imf and infall timescales constant and to scale the effective radius and the star - formation efficiency following the inverse - wind scenario of @xcite ; therefore , for bulges of @xmath2 and @xmath3 we adopted a star - formation efficiency of 11 and 50 gyr@xmath4 and an effective radius of 1 and 4 kpc , respectively .",
    "we define a displacement radius @xmath5 where the gas contained at @xmath6 is carried by  the wind , and we adopt @xmath7 .",
    "the gas binding energy @xmath8 is made up by the contribution of three components , a @xcite distribution for the bulge stellar component , an isothermal dark matter halo with circular velocity @xmath9 and a razor - thin exponential disk .",
    "these components are represented by the terms at the r.h.s . of the equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the bulge gas mass , @xmath12 is the disk scalelenght , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the supernova feedback is calculated as in @xcite .",
    "we consider a spherically accreting bh , at a rate @xmath15 given by the minimum between the bondi and eddington rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity emitted by the bh is then @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xcite ) and we assume that the energy released is a fraction @xmath18 ( @xcite ) of @xmath19 integrated over the  timestep .",
    "we showed that the bh feedback is in most cases not significant in triggering the galactic wind with respect to the supernova feedback .",
    "the predicted bh masses are in agreement with measurements of bh masses inside seyferts ( e.g. @xcite ) and reproduce fairly well the relations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the predicted bolometric luminosities lie in the range @xmath20 ergs  s@xmath4 , in agreement with recent estimates ( e.g. @xcite ) , although we could not reproduce a true quiescence after the peak due to the lack of a hydrodynamical treatment .",
    "solar metallicity is reached in a very short time ( @xmath21 yr ) .",
    "the huge metallicities inferred from observations ( @xcite ) are thus easily achieved , with more massive bulges giving rise to higher metallicities ( up to @xmath22 times solar ) .",
    "after the first @xmath23 years , the bulge ism reaches overabundances of up to 10 times solar for n , fe , si , 5 times solar for mg and 3 times solar for c , o , roughly consistent with the estimates for fe , n and o in the broad and intrinsic narrow line regions of seyferts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the slightly supersolar [ fe / mg ] and its weak dependence on the bulge luminosity ( mass ) are recovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean value of the [ n / c ] ratio is very sensitive on the bulge mass , due to its sensitivity on metallicity .",
    "the predicted values ( n / c @xmath24(n / c)@xmath25 ) agree with the estimates of @xcite .     _ vs. _ @xmath26 relation compared with the observations of marconi & hunt ( 2003 , dashed - dotted line ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2002 , long - dashed line ) . _ middle and right panel _ : evolution with time and redshift @xmath27 of the [ fe / h ] and [ o / h ] abundance ratios ; @xmath27 is derived for a @xmath28cdm cosmology with @xmath29 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32.,title=\"fig : \" ]    _ vs. _ @xmath26 relation compared with the observations of marconi & hunt ( 2003 , dashed - dotted line ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2002 , long - dashed line ) . _",
