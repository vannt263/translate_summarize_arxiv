    "in condensed matter physics , the task of obtaining different mechanical properties of materials , simulated atomistically with a large number of atoms under _ ab initio _ methods , is an almost prohibitive one , in terms of computational effort with the current computer architectures .",
    "it might even at times be impossible .",
    "because of this , producing a `` classical '' interatomic potential as a substitute for the genuine quantum - mechanical interaction of the particles is highly desirable .",
    "the usual procedure is to fit some empirical interatomic potential function , depending on @xmath0 parameters , requiring either agreement with certain macroscopic properties ( structural , thermodynamical , etc . ) or simply agreement between the predicted and observed energies and atomic forces .",
    "a standard algorithm based on force information is the force matching method  @xcite .    in this work we present a methodology for fitting interatomic potentials to _ ab initio _ data , using the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the objective function to be minimized is the total prediction error in the energies for the configurations provided , thus the algorithm does not require any information besides the atomic positions for each configuration and their corresponding _ ab initio _ energies . in particular it does not require the atomic forces , as in other fitting procedures such as force matching methods .",
    "we implemented two families of interatomic potentials , pair potentials and embedded atom potentials . among the former , we tested the well - known lennard - jones potential  @xcite , given by    @xmath1,\\ ] ]    and the 6-parameters `` generic '' potential as implemented in moldy  @xcite ,    @xmath2    from the family of embedded atom potentials  @xcite , having the general form    @xmath3    we implemented the sutton - chen potential , where the pair functions and the embedding function are given by    @xmath4",
    "the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm is based on the idea of distributing the search procedure among a large number of `` agents '' , which act independently of each other .",
    "each agent moves through the search space with a simple dynamics , reacting to fictitious forces drawing it towards its own _ current best _ solution and the _ global best _",
    "solution for the whole swarm . in this way ,",
    "when an agent finds a better solution than the current global best , it becomes the new global best and all the other agents react instantly , the swarm is directed towards the new solution .",
    "for a set of @xmath5 particles represented by their positions @xmath6 , the velocity for the @xmath7-th particle and the @xmath8-th step is    @xmath9    and the position is given by    @xmath10    we employed the following choice of pso parameters : @xmath11=0.7 , @xmath12=1.4 and @xmath13=1.4 , after a few trial convergence runs .",
    "for a potential function where we wish to find the parameters @xmath14 from a set of positions @xmath15 and energies @xmath16 satisfying the relation    @xmath17    with @xmath18    we can define an objective function which is just the total prediction squared error , of the form    @xmath19    and then for the set of parameters @xmath20 that correctly fit the potential @xmath21 we have @xmath22",
    ".    then the problem may be solved numerically with the pso algorithm minimising the function @xmath23 .",
    "we have included some improvements on the pso implementation , particular to our problem .",
    "for instance , we perturbed the swarm every time the procedure gets stuck in a minimum for @xmath24 steps ( @xmath24 proportional to the number of parameters @xmath25 in the potential , usually @xmath26 ) , completely randomizing their positions .",
    "on the other hand , we exploit the fact that for several families of potentials there is a scale parameter for the interatomic distance , let us call it @xmath27 , such that the potential depends on @xmath28 only through @xmath29 .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath27 parameter in the lennard - jones potentials , for the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameters in the generic potential from moldy , and also for the @xmath35 parameter in the sutton - chen variant of the embedded atom potentials .",
    "this distance scale parameter can be constrained to be between the minimum observed distance and a multiple of this value ( typically 10 times ) , which considerably reduces the search space .",
    "parallelization was achieved simply by distributing the pso particles evenly among the different processors using the message passing interface ( mpi ) framework , at each step sharing the global best between all processors .",
    "in order to test the consistency of our procedure , we randomly generate  @xcite a set of 20 configurations and we compute their energy according to the standard lennard - jones parameters for argon , @xmath36 = 0.0103048 ev and @xmath27 = 3.41  .",
    "the resulting set has a standard deviation of energy of 0.41063 ev .",
    "then , with the information of positions and energies ( in a parallel run using 64 cores and 500 pso particles ) , the time needed to find the minimum prediction error was 212.6 s. we can see that the algorithm converge quickly for each parameter , recovering their exact values at 1300 steps ( the prediction error reached is below 10@xmath37 mev / atom ) .     coordinate for the case of a lennard - jones potential as a function of optimization step . ]",
    "coordinate for the case of a lennard - jones potential as a function of optimization step . ]      for the 6-parameters pair potential using the same set of positions and energies obtained for the previous lennard - jones test , the time needed to find the minimum prediction error was 3159.9 s , again using 64 cores and 500 pso particles . in this case",
    "the error for the converged set of parameters falls below 8@xmath3810@xmath39 mev / atom at 9000 steps .",
    "we repeated the same approach for the embedded atom potential , this time using the standard sutton - chen parameters for copper , @xmath36=0.0123820 ev , @xmath35=3.61  , @xmath5=9 , @xmath40=6 and @xmath30=39.432 .",
    "we used 4 configurations as input , and we stopped the minimization procedure after 193015 steps ( execution time was 23 hours with 64 cores and 800 pso particles ) , when we reached a prediction error of about 0.8 mev / atom and the following fitted parameters : @xmath36=0.0145749 ev , @xmath35=3.5834  , @xmath5=8.82683 , @xmath40=5.67465 , and @xmath30=37.028 .",
    "in order to test our procedure on a more realist scenario and assess the quality of the fitted potentials we performed _",
    "ab initio _ microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations of copper at different temperatures ( covering its solid , liquid and superheated phases ) .",
    "all molecular dynamics calculations were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in vasp  @xcite .",
    "we used perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) pseudopotentials  @xcite with an energy cutoff of 204.9 ev and @xmath8-point expansion around the @xmath41 point only .    from these simulations , we generated 13229 different atomic configurations with their respective energies , mixed from solid , liquid and superheated state simulations . among them",
    "we chose a subset of 30 with maximum standard deviation of the energy ( namely 0.24 ev / atom ) , in order to increase the transferability of the fitted potential .",
    "these configurations were used as input to the fitting procedure .",
    "we found the sutton - chen potential parameters presented in table [ tbl_cu ] , with a prediction error of 5.19 mev / atom .",
    ".sutton - chen potential parameters for cu , fitted from ab initio data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we tested these parameters by performing classical molecular dynamics simulations using the lpmd  @xcite code , with a 4x4x4 fcc simulation cell ( 256 atoms ) . fig .",
    "[ fig_cu_gdr ] shows the radial distribution function @xmath42 produced by our fitted cu potential for liquid at @xmath43=1500 k. it reproduces exactly all features ( positions of minima and maxima , heights of the maxima ) found in a previous ab initio fitting study  @xcite .     for liquid copper at @xmath43=1500 k. ]",

    "the @xmath45 curve is drawn by performing different molecular dynamics simulations at different initial kinetic energies ( in every simulation the system starts with the ideal crystalline configuration ) .",
    "the discontinuity in the isochore signals the melting point .",

    "the highest point is the critical superheating temperature @xmath47 , around @xmath48 2020 k. for comparison we also included the isochoric curve calculated with the potential parameters by sutton and chen , which gives @xmath46 around 2000 k for the same system size and number of simulation steps .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to use a parallel algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to fit interatomic potentials to _ ab initio _ energies only .",
    "our procedure has been tested by fitting both pair potentials and embedded atom potentials , up to a prediction error of the order of 1 mev / atom , using between 5 and 30 different configurations .",

    "we demonstrated the capabilities of our method by fitting a set of sutton - chen parameters for copper using _ ab initio _ data from three thermodynamic phases .",
    "this fitted potential is able to reproduce the radial distribution function , although it underestimates the diffusion coefficient for liquid copper at @xmath43=1500 k ( with respect to experimental data ) .",
