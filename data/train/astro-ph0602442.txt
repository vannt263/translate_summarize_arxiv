    "the two radio- and -undetected @xmath0 wlqs ( from our second group of wlqs ) and phl1811 might appear to constitute the tail of the radio/-weak bl  lac population , but their radio and  properties are also consistent with those of typical rqqs . according to fig.[a_ro_a_ox ] , most of the @xmath183 bl  lac candidates from collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are consistent with the radio and  properties of both radio - weak bl  lacs and typical rqqs , although the loose constraints on their @xmath6  values ( based on _ rosat _ measurements ) prevent a proper distinction between bl  lacs and rqqs , as well as a comparison with the wlqs .",
    "since most bl  lacs at @xmath161 are strong radio sources , it is interesting to note that most wlqs , and the collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xmath183 bl  lac candidates , are radio weak .",
    "the lack of radio - loud ( @xmath138@xmath184 , equivalent to @xmath185 ) wlqs might perhaps be attributed to the fact that they are all highly optically luminous sources .",
    "we investigated this possibility by examining the luminosities , @xmath138 , and @xmath6  values of samples of lower - redshift ( @xmath161 ) bl  lacs . while bl  lacs from the emss sample ( e.g. , rector et al .",
    "2000 ) tend to be more radio/-weak at high optical luminosities , the bl  lacs from the larger rgb sample ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1999 ) do not show this trend , and weak ( and strong ) radio sources are found at all luminosities . however , this is not sufficient to rule out a possible luminosity effect , since even the most luminous bl  lacs considered are two orders of magnitude less optically luminous than our wlqs , thus preventing a straightforward comparison of the radio properties between the two classes of sources .",
    "the lack of highly optically luminous bl  lacs may be a consequence of their selection , which is performed mainly with radio and  surveys . since it is possible that these selection methods have allowed highly optically luminous bl  lacs to escape detection , we checked for a radio - loudness  luminosity relation among the collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) optically - selected sample of low - redshift bl  lac candidates , but no clear trend has been found .",
    "two other well - known characteristics of bl  lacs are rapid and large - amplitude optical flux variations , and high levels ( up to 40% ) of optical polarization ( e.g. , jannuzi , smith , & elston 1994 ) .",
    "stalin & srianand ( 2005 ) have detected optical flux variations at a level of @xmath870.3mag in the prototype wlq , sdssj1532@xmath110039 , on an observed - frame time baseline of 450d ( 80d in the rest - frame ) , although this is somewhat lower than , and not as fast as , the level displayed by typical bl  lacs ( e.g. , ghosh et al .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have constrained the optical polarization level of sdssj1532@xmath110039 to be @xmath186% .",
    "this is consistent with single - epoch measurements of polarization levels in -selected bl  lacs , which are typically lower than the polarization levels observed in radio - selected bl  lacs ( e.g. , jannuzi et al .",
    "1994 ; visvanathan & wills 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , low optical polarization levels in wlqs might be expected due to their radio weakness , regardless of whether they are bl  lacs or not .",
    "while the nature of wlqs remains mysterious and apparently there is significant variety among this class of sources , a ` boosted continuum ' or a ` suppression of high - ionization belr lines ' remain the most likely scenarios .",
    "the significant overlap in the radio and  properties between different agn classes ( i.e. , bl  lacs and radio - quiet agns ) as well as the multiple selection biases , as depicted in the @xmath138@xmath6  diagram ( fig.[a_ro_a_ox ] ) , might cause physically distinct agn populations to blend together , and thus prevent a clear conclusion for the nature of wlqs .",
    "this calls for a more thorough and systematic investigation of the ` continuum boosting ' versus ` high - ionization emission - line suppression ' scenarios via more observations such as those described below , and detailed photoionization modeling . while relativistic boosting of the continuum may be consistent with the optical spectra , radio fluxes , and  fluxes of the sources from our second group of wlqs as well as with some of the @xmath183 bl  lac candidates of collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , it can not hold for the two @xmath182 wlqs that display balmer emission lines .",
    "it is also hard to accept a boosting scenario for our first group of wlqs and most of the @xmath183 bl  lac candidates of collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , due to the weakness of their radio and  emission .",
    "in addition , the fact that radio - loud wlqs ( with @xmath185 ) are missing is naturally explained by the ` line suppression ' scenario , which does not require that the quasars be radio - loud .",
    "the following observations for all @xmath0 wlqs and the @xmath183 bl  lac candidates of collinge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are required to enable a clearer distinction between the two proposed scenarios :    1 .",
    "sensitive near - ir spectroscopy to reveal any low - ionization emission lines ( e.g. , balmer or lines ) and determine whether the continua are typical of rqqs .",
    "clear detection of low - ionization lines , and/or a typical ( or bluer ) continuum will support the ` high - ionization line suppression ' scenario , while the non - detection of such lines and redder continua will support the bl  lac interpretation .",
    "_ spitzer _ near  mid - ir observations ( using _ irac _ and _ mips _ ) may determine whether the sed is consistent with a typical agn ir ` bump ' or with a beamed , ` bump - less ' , continuum .",
    "3 .   optical  near - ir photometric monitoring to detect rapid and large - amplitude flux variations can check for a boosted continuum .",
    "+   +      the absence of prominent optical emission lines in luminous , high - redshift quasars has raised several other possible explanations for their peculiar spectra .",
    "one of these is that high - redshift wlqs are not quasars at all , but rather normal galaxies ( e.g. , ivison et al .",
    "their measured luminosities are much larger than even the most luminous galaxies , but could perhaps be explained by magnification due to gravitational lensing .",
    "our  observations rule out that possibility , at least for the cases of the three -detected high - redshift wlqs that show agn - like  properties , i.e. , typical agn optical - to - x - ray flux ratios ( see the @xmath6  values in table[properties ] and in schneider et al .",
    "2003 ; normal galaxies typically have @xmath6@xmath187 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the continuum source in high - redshift wlqs is amplified relative to the emission from the , much larger , broad emission - line region by gravitational microlensing , since the degree of amplification is inversely proportional to the size of the emitting region ( e.g. , paczynski 1986 ; schneider & weiss 1987 ; ostriker & vietri 1990 ) .",
    "such microlensing events are expected to be both relatively short ( months  years ) and rare , and they might perhaps qualitatively explain the rarity of high - redshift wlqs among the quasar population ( e.g. , wambsganss , schneider , & paczynski 1990 ) . testing",
    "this scenario would require spectroscopic monitoring of our high - redshift wlqs to search for the reappearance of the emission lines .",
    "however , the sdss images of our wlqs , and the  images of our -detected wlqs , do not show evidence for multiple images or lensing galaxies in their vicinity , and therefore a microlensing interpretation is unlikely ( we also note that our wlqs were not targeted with the _ hubble space telescope _ by richards et al .",
    "we present new _ chandra",
    "_  observations of 21 @xmath0 quasars , including most of the highest - redshift quasars known as well as four members of the wlq class .",
    "we have doubled the number of -detected quasars at @xmath1 , allowing investigation of the  spectral properties of agns at the end of the reionization epoch .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the mean power - law  photon index of @xmath1 rqqs is @xmath26=1.95@xmath188 , and it is consistent with photon indices observed for rqq samples at lower redshifts .",
    "the upper limit on the mean intrinsic - absorption column density of @xmath1 rqqs is @xmath36@xmath8410@xmath125@xmath5 , implying that rqqs at the dawn of the modern universe were not heavily absorbed .",
    "the @xmath6  values for individual rqqs in our sample , as well as the mean @xmath6  of @xmath1 rqqs , excluding balqsos , are consistent with the values predicted from their uv luminosities .",
    "this strengthens previous findings that agn seds have not significantly evolved over cosmic time .",
    "we detected two of our @xmath0 wlqs in , and distinguished two types of wlqs : radio - quiet wlqs which are also  weak , and radio - quiet ",
    "moderate wlqs ( i.e. , with @xmath189 ) that are mildly  bright . based on single - epoch optical spectra as well as  and radio fluxes of these sources ,",
    "we discuss several possible interpretations for the weakness of the broad - emission lines , and in particular , continuum boosting versus high - ionization emission - line suppression , which are the more likely scenarios .",
    "we propose sensitive near - ir spectroscopy , near  mid - ir photometry , and optical  near - ir monitoring to disentangle these two scenarios .",
