    "relay - assisted transmission schemes for wireless networks are continuing to flourish due to their potential of providing the benefits of space diversity without the need for physical antenna arrays @xcite . among the earliest work on cooperative networks are references @xcite .",
    "a cooperative diversity model is proposed in @xcite and @xcite , in which two users act as partners and cooperatively communicate with a common destination , each transmitting its own bit in the first time interval and the estimated bit of its partner in the second time interval . in @xcite , several low - complexity cooperative protocols are proposed and studied , including fixed relaying , selection relaying and incremental relaying , in which the relay node can either amplify - and - forward ( af ) or decode - and - forward ( df ) the signal it receives . in @xcite , networks consisting of more than two users that employ the space - time coding to achieve the cooperative diversity are considered .",
    "coded cooperation schemes are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , where a user transmits part of its partner s codeword as well .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite investigate the capacity of relay networks of arbitrary size .",
    "references so far have shown that , relay nodes can provide performance improvement in terms of outage behavior @xcite , achievable rate region@xcite , and error probability @xcite .",
    "power efficiency is a critical design consideration for wireless networks such as ad - hoc and sensor networks , due to the limited transmission power of the ( relay and the source ) nodes . to that end , choosing the appropriate relays to forward the source data , as well as the transmit power levels of all the nodes become important design issues .",
    "optimum power allocation strategies for relay networks are studied up - to - date for several structures and relay transmission schemes .",
    "three - node models are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , while multi - hop relay networks are studied in @xcite .",
    "relay forwarding strategies for both af and df parallel relay channels in wideband regime are proposed in @xcite .",
    "recent works also discuss relay selection algorithms for networks with multiple relays .",
    "optimum relay selection strategies for several models are identified in @xcite .",
    "recently proposed practical relay selection strategies include pre - select one relay @xcite , best - select relay @xcite , blind - selection - algorithm @xcite , informed - selection - algorithm @xcite , and cooperative relay selection @xcite .",
    "all of these proposed methods result in power efficient transmission strategies .",
    "however , the common theme is that , the implementations of these algorithms require either the destination or the source to have substantial information about the network , such as the channel state information ( csi ) of all communication channels , received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at every node , the topology of the network , etc . such centralized power allocation / relay selection schemes may be infeasible to implement due to the substantial feedback requirements , overhead and delay they may introduce .    to overcome the obstacles of a centralized architecture , several heuristic approaches have been proposed in @xcite , for multi - user networks with coded cooperation . in this work , users select cooperation partners based on a priority list in a distributed manner . although the proposed algorithms are advantageous due to their ease of implementation , their performance depends on the fading conditions , and the randomness in the channel may prevent the protocols from providing full diversity . in @xcite ,",
    "an snr threshold method is proposed for the relay node to make a decision on whether to forward the source data in a three - node model .",
    "since there is only one relay node in the considered system , relay selection is not an issue .",
    "reference @xcite provides a relay selection algorithm based on instantaneous channel measurements done by each relay node locally . for the purpose of reducing the communication among relays , a flag packet is broadcasted by the selected relay to notify the other relays of the result .    in this paper , we investigate _ optimum distributed power allocation _ strategies for decode - and - forward parallel relay networks , in which only partial csi is accessible at the source and the relay nodes .",
    "we first propose a distributed decision mechanism for each relay node to individually make a decision on whether to forward the source data .",
    "in contrast to the snr based decision protocol presented in @xcite , in our proposed decision mechanism , the relay makes its decision not only by considering its received snr , but also by comparing its relay - to - destination channel gain with a given threshold , and no feedback from the destination is needed .",
    "the overall overhead is further reduced as compared to the method proposed in @xcite since the distributed decision mechanism does not require communication among relays .",
    "secondly , given such a relay decision scheme , and considering an outage occurs whenever the snr at the destination is lower than the required value ( target ) , we formulate the distributed power allocation problem that aims to minimize the expected value of the total transmit power while providing the target snr at the destination with an outage probability constraint .",
    "we identify the solution of this problem , that consists of the optimum value of the source power , and the corresponding relay decision threshold based on the partial csi available at the source .",
    "the extra power the distributed power allocation mechanism needs as compared to the optimum centralized power allocation mechanism , i.e. , the _ additional power expenditure _ , is examined to observe the tradeoff between the outage probability and the additional power expenditure .",
    "we next consider two special cases with simpler implementation , namely the _ passive source model _ where the source does not contribute to the relay selection process , and the _ single relay model _ where one relay node is selected to forward the source data based on limited csi .",
    "for each case , we optimize the respective relevant parameters .",
    "our results demonstrate that considerable power savings can be obtained by our proposed distributed relay selection and power allocation schemes with respect to random relay selection .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sysmodel ] ,",
    "the system model is described .",
    "the distributed power allocation problem is formulated and the optimum solution is given in section  [ dra ] . in section  [ ss ] , we investigate the passive source model and the single relay model .",
    "numerical results supporting the theoretical analysis are presented in section  [ nr ] , and section  [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a relay network consisting of a source - destination pair and @xmath0 relay nodes employing decode - and - forward .",
    "we assume that the relay nodes operate in pre - assigned orthogonal channels , e.g. in non - overlapping time / frequency slots , or using orthogonal signatures .",
    "the source is assumed to transmit in a time slot prior to ( and non - overlapping with ) the relays .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the fading coefficients of the source - to - relay and relay - to - destination channels for the @xmath3 relay node , for @xmath4 .",
    "the fading coefficient of the source - to - destination link is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that each channel is flat fading , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 are all independent realizations of zero mean complex gaussian random variables with variances @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 per dimension , respectively .",
    "[ t ]     without loss of generality , we will assume that we have a time slotted system in the sequel .",
    "the system model is shown in figure [ fig - sysmodel ] . in the first time slot ,",
    "the source broadcasts @xmath9 with power @xmath10 .",
    "the destination observes @xmath11 : @xmath12 and the @xmath13th relay observes @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) terms at the destination and the relays , respectively .",
    "assume without loss of generality that they are of variance @xmath18 per dimension .",
    "the @xmath13th relay node is said to be _ reliable _ and can correctly decode @xmath9 when its received snr , @xmath19 , satisfies @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the given decodability constraint . in the subsequent time slots following the first one ,",
    "the relays that belong to the set of reliable relays , @xmath22 , can decode and forward the source data to the destination , each in its assigned time slot . throughout this paper , we assume that the reliable relays simply regenerate the source data @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the signal received at the destination from the reliable relay @xmath13 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the transmit power of the @xmath13th relay node , and @xmath25 is the awgn term at the @xmath13th relay - to - destination channel .",
    "the destination combines signals received from the reliable relay nodes and the direct link with a maximum ratio combiner ( mrc ) , and the resulting snr at the destination is @xmath26 we consider that the destination can correctly receive the source data whenever @xmath27 .    given this system model , the power allocation problem for regenerative df relay networks with parallel relays",
    "can be posed as @xmath28 we note that the resulting power allocation strategy may prevent some reliable relays from participating simply by assigning zero power to those relays .",
    "the optimum power allocation strategy for df relay networks using different code books at the relays is identified in @xcite .",
    "this strategy , re - stated below for the benefit of the reader , is easily seen to be the optimum _ centralized _ power allocation strategy for regenerative df relay networks as well .",
    "@xmath29\\label{optrelsel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 . in ( [ optrelsel ] ) ,",
    "the set @xmath31 denotes the set of efficient relays such that the transmission through the relay is more power efficient than the direct transmission , i.e. , @xmath32    observe that when the source power is assigned as in ( [ sourceoptpower ] ) , the relay node @xmath33 , chosen according to ( [ optrelsel ] ) , is the only relay node with received snr equal to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , each relay node can decide whether it is the intended relay node by simply checking its received snr .",
    "when the snr contribution of the relay node , @xmath35 , is indicated explicitly by the source , the intended relay node can calculate its required transmit power as in ( [ relayoptpower ] ) and forward @xmath9 to the destination .",
    "alternatively , the source can broadcast the selected relay and the optimum power level in a side channel .",
    "a moment s thought reveals that to implement the strategy given by ( [ sourceoptpower])-([optrelsel ] ) , the full csi , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath5 , at the source node , and the individual csi , i.e. , @xmath37 , at relay node @xmath13 are needed .",
    "although ( [ sourceoptpower])-([optrelsel ] ) provides the most power efficient df relay transmission strategy , its centralized nature , i.e. , the fact that it requires the channel estimate of each link and the feedback of this information to the source , may render its implementation impractical . as such",
    ", distributed strategies are needed . in the following , we devise efficient distributed power allocation strategies .",
    "our aim in this paper is to find power allocation schemes that _ do not require a centralized mechanism _ , and utilize the limited available csi at each node . in practice , it is feasible that the channels are estimated by training before the actual data transmission , when each node operates in tdma mode . when the source transmits the training bits , all relay nodes can simultaneously estimate their source - to - relay fading coefficients @xmath38 due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium . similarly ,",
    "when the relay node @xmath13 transmits the training bits , the source - to - relay coefficient @xmath1 can be estimated at the source . however , for @xmath39 to be available at the source , the feedback from the destination for each realization is required , which may be impractical .",
    "thus , we investigate distributed power allocation schemes when the source has the realizations @xmath38 and @xmath5 , and only the statistics of @xmath40 .",
    "the relay nodes are assumed to have their individual csi , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for relay @xmath13 , @xmath4 .",
    "we first derive a distributed decision mechanism with the model assumptions given above .",
    "since the source has only the statistical description instead of the realizations @xmath39 , the optimum centralized power allocation indicated by ( [ sourceoptpower])-([optrelsel ] ) can not be implemented by the source .",
    "also , while it is clear that for a fixed source power , the best strategy is transmitting through the reliable relay node that has the highest relay - to - destination channel gain , this mechanism requires a comparison of all @xmath39 .",
    "the distributed nature of the strategy requires that each relay should make its decision relying only on its individual csi . since each relay",
    "can easily determine whether it is a reliable relay by using its snr value , i.e. , its individual csi , we propose that the @xmath13th reliable relay decides it will be a forwarding node when its channel gain to the destination satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a given threshold value .",
    "relay @xmath13 then forwards the decoded signal with _",
    "sufficient _ power .",
    "that is , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the snr contribution from the relay . and @xmath45 values are assumed to be broadcasted by the source on a side channel . ]",
    "we note that such a distributed decision mechanism includes the probability that more than one relay will transmit .",
    "similarly , we note that with any @xmath46 , the scheme results in a nonzero probability that none of the relay nodes satisfies ( [ best ] ) , and hence a nonzero outage probability @xmath47 . as such , the source should determine the optimum source power and the corresponding threshold @xmath42 by considering the realizations of @xmath48 and the randomness in @xmath40 , to meet a system given specification , i.e. , an outage probability requirement .",
    "given the above described strategy , we now investigate how the source should decide the value of its transmit power @xmath10 and the relay decision threshold @xmath42 , to satisfy the target snr , @xmath34 at the destination with a target outage probability , @xmath49 .",
    "[ theorem1]the optimum source power , @xmath56 , can only be one of the @xmath57 discrete values in the set @xmath58 where we reorder the indices of the relay nodes such that @xmath59 . is the largest candidate of the source power . with this power level",
    ", source can reach the destination via the direct link and relay transmission is not needed . ] for each possible @xmath56 value , there exist a corresponding reliable relay set @xmath60 , and a unique optimum threshold value , @xmath61 .",
    "assume that @xmath62 and there exist a reliable relay set @xmath63 containing @xmath64 relay nodes and a corresponding threshold value @xmath65 .",
    "then , the expected value of the total power is @xmath66=p_s+\\nonumber\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\\\ \\sum_{i \\in a_r^\\dag } \\int_{\\gamma^\\dag}^\\infty \\frac{(snr_{target}-p_s |h|^2)^+}{2\\sigma_{g_i}^2x_i } \\exp(\\frac{-x_i}{2\\sigma_{g_i}^2})dx_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the set of transmitting relays as a super relay node whose effective channel gain to the destination is @xmath67 .",

    "the relay transmission is preferred when @xmath72 $ ] with respect to @xmath10 is @xmath73}{\\partial p_s}=1 - \\frac{|h|^2}{{\\left| g_{eff } \\right|}^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and ( [ relayisprefered ] ) implies @xmath74}{\\partial p_s}>0 $ ] , which means increasing @xmath10 beyond @xmath75 until the value @xmath76 for @xmath77 does not change @xmath63 but increases the expected value of the total power @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "thus , the optimum source power @xmath56 can be only one of the ( m+1 ) discrete values in the set given by ( [ set ] ) .    for @xmath62 , one of the candidates of the optimum source power , and its corresponding reliable set @xmath63 , when @xmath79 increases , the expected value of the total power decreases , while the outage probability increases .",
    "therefore , threshold @xmath65 should be chosen as the value that satisfies the outage probability with equality , i.e. , @xmath80 it can be further reduced to @xmath81 let @xmath82@xmath83@xmath84 and @xmath85@xmath83@xmath86 , we have @xmath87 therefore , @xmath65 is bounded as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the value of @xmath65 can be obtained by a search in the range @xmath91 $ ] numerically .",
    "note that for @xmath92 , i.e. , when the source can reach the destination via the direct link , @xmath93 to prevent any redundant relay transmission and power consumption .",
    "the source should simply compare @xmath57 possible @xmath78 $ ] values and decide the best @xmath94 pair .",
    "note that when the expected value of the total transmit power is higher than that with direct transmission , the source will prefer to transmit directly to the source .",
    "the cost of the lack of full csi at the source , i.e. , the cost of using the distributed relay decision mechanism , is an additional power expenditure .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the total power of the proposed optimum distributed power allocation scheme , and that of the optimum centralized allocation scheme which is the sum of the source power @xmath97 and the relay power @xmath98 given in ( [ sourceoptpower])-([optrelsel ] ) , respectively .",

    "thus , there exists a tradeoff between the outage probability and the additional power expenditure : reducing the target outage probability will require more additional power .",
    "while designing the power allocation strategy , a reasonable target outage probability should be chosen in accordance with this tradeoff .",
    "the optimum distributed power allocation strategy still requires the realizations of @xmath38 and @xmath5 , i.e. , the csi of the source - to - relay and the direct links , available at the source .",
    "it also requires the source to update the threshold @xmath61 and the source power @xmath56 at each time when these channel coefficients change . due to further limitations on the availability of this csi and for implementation complexity",
    ", we may opt for even simpler schemes . in this context , we next consider two special cases , namely the passive source model and the single relay model . for both cases , we have the previous assumption that each relay has its individual csi , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for relay @xmath13 , @xmath4 .",
    "below are the brief descriptions of the two models .",
    "* _ passive source model : _ we assume that the source only has the statistics of _ all _ communication channels , and does not participate in the relay selection process at all . for this model , we fix the source power @xmath10 , and the relay decision threshold @xmath42 , and employ the same distributed decision mechanism as proposed in [ ddm ] .    *",
    "_ single relay model : _ we assume that the source has csi of the direct and the source - to - relay links , i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath5 , and the statistics of the relay - to - destination links @xmath40 .",
    "we have the source select _ one _ assisting relay node to satisfy the system requirements on received snr and the outage probability .      in practice",
    ", we may have situations where the source does not have the realizations of any of the channels , but has access only to the statistical descriptions of them .",
    "it may also be the case that the source may not be able to do computationally expensive operations , e.g. , due to hardware constraints in sensor or rfid networks .",
    "we term such source nodes , _ passive_.",
    "considering these practical issues , in this section , we investigate the distributed power allocation for the passive source model .",
    "since each relay has its individual csi , we can apply the same distributed decision mechanism as proposed in section [ ddm ] .",
    "however , a passive source can not optimize its power @xmath10 or @xmath42 based on channel realizations ; they should be found off - line based on the statistical descriptions of the channel and kept fixed for all realizations .",
    "note that , different from section [ dra ] , in this case , we may end up having no reliable relay if the fixed source power value is too small .",
    "let us now develop the criterion on how to choose the source power @xmath10 and the threshold @xmath42 by considering the outage probability and the additional power expenditure jointly .",
    "the outage probability of the direct link is given by @xmath102 for clarity of exposition , let us define @xmath103 as the probability that the @xmath13th relay is a reliable relay , @xmath104 as the probability that the @xmath13th relay satisfies ( [ best ] ) , and @xmath105 as the probability that the @xmath13th relay is in set @xmath106 , which denotes the set of relays that satisfy both ( [ reliable ] ) and ( [ best ] ) .",

    "note that when @xmath10 is chosen close to this minimum value , the corresponding @xmath42 factor will be close to 0 , resulting in many relays transmitting .",

    "a reasonable pair of the source power and the threshold @xmath42 should be chosen by considering both the tradeoff and the properties of the @xmath137 pair in ( [ overallout ] ) , ( [ prop1 ] ) and ( [ prop5 ] ) .      the distributed power allocation schemes proposed up to this point in general result in multiple relays transmitting to the destination , causing additional power expenditure . in this section , we investigate the case where only one relay node selected by the source is allowed to transmit .",
    "in contrast to the centralized solution in ( [ sourceoptpower])-([optrelsel ] ) , however , we consider that the source has limited csi .",
    "in particular , we re - emphasize that , only the statistical descriptions of the relay - to - destination channels are available at the source . adopting the single relay model , we will see that the task of finding the threshold value for the relay forwarding decisions can be substantially simplified as compared to the optimum distributed strategy .    when relay @xmath138 is selected , the source transmits with just enough power @xmath139 to make relay @xmath138 a reliable relay .",

    ", we define that an outage occurs for ocpa when the total transmit power is higher than a given power constraint .",

    "the power savings is more pronounced for low outage probability values .",
    "as expected , an additional power expenditure , which is the penalty of lack of full csi , is introduced by odpa .",

    "however , the two special cases still outperform rrs by considering the limited available csi for power allocation , and they simplify the optimization process of odpa and facilitate the implementations .",

    "we observe that in the absence of the relays , direct transmission scheme requires a relatively high power expenditure to achieve the same outage probability as compared to odpa .",
    "it is observed that the proposed relay - assisted transmission scheme provides significant performance gain in terms of power efficiency upon the direct transmission .",
    "this is intuitively pleasing since the relay selection and power allocation algorithms in the proposed scheme guarantee that the more power efficient way is always selected out of the relay - assisted transmission and the direct transmission for each channel realization .",
