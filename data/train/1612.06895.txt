    "it is therefore important to establish that such effects do not dominate the response of the squids described in this study .",
    "to do so , we first provide some qualitative arguments which make it evident that the skewness arises only from a non - sinusoidal cpr . furthermore , we extract the loop inductance of our squid , use it as an input for the rcsj model and confirm that ( within our experimental resolution ) the inductance does not play an important role in determining the shape of the @xmath44 curves , and hence does not affect our ability to measure the cpr .       plots with fixed @xmath4 , but varying @xmath3 , as shown earlier in figure  2a of the main text .",

    "we find that the calculated @xmath194 does not depend very sensitively on the precise value @xmath191 and @xmath185 because most of the backscattering taking place at the interface of the s leads and the n region is due to a `` geometric '' effect : the electron trajectories have to turn at right angle to arrive from the lead into the n region .",
    "moreover , we find that for @xmath193 the calculated dependence of the normal state resistance @xmath195 on the doping of the n region agrees qualitatively well with the measurements where the right jj was kept at the charge neutrality point [ c.f .",

    "the leads in the transport direction ( which is the @xmath196 direction in top - contacted geometry and the @xmath188 direction in the side - contacted one , see figure [ fig : contact - geometries ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the s leads , which are always n - doped in our calculations , the normal region of the jj can be either @xmath50 or @xmath9 doped depending on the gate voltage .",

    "the total potential profile along the junction , which describes the smooth transition between the highly doped regions ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and the central part of the junction ( @xmath220 ) is modeled by @xmath221 where the parameter @xmath222 controls the smoothness of the transition .",
    "we used @xmath223 in our calculations corresponding to a relatively sharp transition .",
    "larger values of @xmath222 would effectively mean that the leads @xmath50 dope the n region of the junction and the doping there would therefore not be determined by @xmath197 .    finally ,",

    "we made sure that that the fermi - wavelengths @xmath224 and @xmath225 in the n and s regions , respectively , satisfy @xmath226 .",
    "this ensures that the exact spatial dependence of the superconducting pair potential at the n - s interface is not very important in the calculations@xcite .",
    "following reference @xcite , we also considered the effect of quasiparticle broadening in the superconducting terminals by introducing a complex energy shift @xmath227 in the self - energy calculations .",
    "such a broadening , described by the parameter @xmath228 , can arise due to scattering with phonons or other electrons or due to other effects leading to quasiparticle poisoning .",

    "since @xmath12 is not the main focus of this work , we do not discuss the details here .",
    "instead , we present results to illustrate the effect of @xmath228 on the skewness .",
    "we repeated the calculations using @xmath229 and the results are shown in figure [ fig : skewness - eta ] . comparing figure 4(d ) in the main text and figure [ fig : skewness - eta ] ,",
    "one can notice that the results are qualitatively very similar , but for @xmath230 the average skewness is larger for both @xmath201 and @xmath202 doping than for @xmath231 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath202 regime the calculated average skewness @xmath232 for @xmath230 is closer to the measured one @xmath233 than the result @xmath234 for @xmath229 .",
    "the opposite is true in the @xmath201 regime , where the calculations with @xmath229 ( @xmath230 ) yielding @xmath235 ( @xmath234 ) give better agreement with the measurements ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "we were not able to achieve an equally good agreement in both the @xmath201 and @xmath202 regimes using a single value of @xmath228 .",
    "this may indicate that @xmath228 depends on the doping of the junction , but one would need a more microscopic understanding of the processes that contribute to @xmath228 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that @xmath228 is not the only parameter which can affect the value of the skewness .",
    "generally , the value of the skewness depends on the interface between the s and n regions .",
    "calculations not shown here indicated that the presence / absence of a smooth transition between the highly doped leads and the normal graphene region ( the parameter @xmath222 in eq.[eq : potential ] ) and the value of the hopping amplitude @xmath237 in figure [ fig : contact - geometries](b ) between the s and n regions can also affect the results .",
    "however , we fixed the value of the parameters describing the junction such that we obtain a qualitatively good agreement for @xmath195 ( as discussed previously ) and did not changed these parameters in the skewness calculations .",
    "we also performed calculations using the side - contact geometry , which is shown in figure  [ fig : contact - geometries](b ) .",
    "this contact geometry has recently been employed , e.g. , in reference  @xcite to model diffusive graphene jjs both in the short and in the long junction regime .",
    "the most important results of our calculations are shown in figure [ fig : side - contact ] .",
    "we have used the same doping profile @xmath238 along the junction as in the top - contact geometry .",
    "as it can be seen in figure [ fig : side - contact](a ) , by choosing @xmath239 , the doping dependence of the normal state resistance is qualitatively very similar for both models .",
    "one can notice , however , that the amplitude of the @xmath195 oscillations for @xmath202 doping is larger in the side - contact geometry . in the @xmath201 regime",
    "the amplitude of the fp oscillations is somewhat different , but the oscillations are in the same phase , except for large @xmath9 doping .",
    "the skewness calculation for the side contact geometry is shown in figure [ fig : side - contact](b ) .",
    "we used the same @xmath61 and @xmath229 as for the corresponding calculation in the top - contact geometry . the result",

    "such large oscillations are not present in the experimental data and for this reason we find a better overall agreement between the experiments the the calculations using the top - contact geometry .",

    "<S> these include the observation of specular andreev reflection  @xcite , crossed andreev reflections  @xcite , and superconducting proximity effects in ballistic graphene josephson junctions ( jjs )  @xcite . in a majority of these studies the device comprises of graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride ( bn ) contacted along the edge by a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the encapsulation in bn keeps the graphene clean , while the edge contacting scheme provides transparent interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , ballistic jjs fabricated in this manner have been central to recent studies of novel andreev bound states in perpendicular magnetic fields  @xcite , edge - mode superconductivity  @xcite , and supercurrents in the quantum hall regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to date there have been no measurements of the josephson current phase relation ( cpr ) in these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the cpr is arguably one of the most basic properties of a jj , and provides information about the andreev bound state ( abs ) spectrum in the junction . while typical superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) </S>",
    "<S> jjs exhibit a sinusoidal cpr , deviations from this behavior can be present in superconductor - normal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions . </S>",
    "<S> examples of this include jjs with high transmission such as nanowires  @xcite and atomic point contacts  @xcite , where the cpr contains significant higher frequency components . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the periodicity of the cpr itself can be different from @xmath0 for more exotic systems such as topological jjs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for graphene jjs there have been several numerical estimates of the cpr which take into account its linear dispersion relation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , ballistic graphene jjs operated in large magnetic fields have been predicted to undergo a topological transition  @xcite which should be detectable via direct cpr measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental determination of the cpr in graphene has been restricted to junctions which are either in the diffusive limit  @xcite or in a geometry which does not allow gate control of the junction properties  @xcite .        here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a dc superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) to directly determine the cpr in encapsulated graphene jjs . </S>",
    "<S> these graphene squids stand out from previous studies  @xcite in two important ways . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the superconducting contacts are made with molybdenum rhenium ( more ) , which allows us to operate the squid up to 4.2  k. more importantly , our squid consists of graphene jjs which are ballistic and independently tunable , thereby allowing full electrostatic control over the squid response . by applying appropriate gate voltages </S>",
    "<S> we can continuously tune from a symmetric to an asymmetric squid . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the asymmetric configuration allows us to directly extract the cpr from flux periodic oscillations in the critical current of the squid . </S>",
    "<S> the cpr is found to be non - sinusoidal , displaying a prominent forward skewing . </S>",
    "<S> this skewness can be tuned over a large range with the gate voltage and shows correlations with fabry - prot ( fp ) resistance oscillations in the ballistic cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we complement our experiments with tight - binding simulations which go beyond the short junction limit and explicitly take into account realistic graphene - superconductor interfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : squid]a shows a scanning electron micrograph and cross - sectional schematic of a device . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of two encapsulated graphene jjs contacted with more , incorporated in a squid loop . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication strategy is similar to earlier work  @xcite and further details are provided in the supplementary information ( si ) . the left  ( l - jj)/right  ( r - jj ) jjs can be tuned independently by applying voltages ( @xmath1/@xmath2 ) to local top gates . </S>",
    "<S> the junctions are intentionally designed to have a geometrical asymmetry , which ensures that the critical current of r - jj  ( @xmath3 ) is larger than that of l - jj  ( @xmath4 ) at the same carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> we report on two devices ( dev1 and dev2 ) both of which have the same lithographic dimensions ( l  @xmath5  w ) for l - jj ( 400  nm  @xmath5  2  @xmath6 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions of r - jj for dev1 and dev2 are 400  nm  @xmath5  4  @xmath6 m and 400  nm  @xmath5  8  @xmath6 m respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were performed using a dc current bias applied across the squid , in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 40  mk .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : squid]b shows the variation in the normal state resistance ( @xmath7 ) of the squid with @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath8  k. the device was biased with a relatively large current of 500  na , which is larger than the critical current of the squid for most of the gate range . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : squid]c shows a single trace taken along the white dashed line of figure  [ fig : squid]b , where r - jj is held at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see clear fp oscillations on the hole ( @xmath9 ) doped region due to the formation of @xmath10 junctions at the superconductor - graphene interfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the criss - cross pattern seen in the lower left quadrant of figure  [ fig : squid]b indicates that both graphene junctions are in the ballistic limit and that there is no cross - talk between the individual gates . </S>",
    "<S> we note that when @xmath11  v the critical current of the squid ( @xmath12 ) is larger than the applied current bias , and a zero - resistance state is thus visible even at 4.2  k. having established the fact that our jjs are in the ballistic regime , we now look in more detail at the behavior of the squid . at @xmath13  </S>",
    "<S> k we first tune the gate voltages ( @xmath14  v , @xmath15  v ) such that the squid is in a symmetric configuration and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : squid]d shows the variation in differential resistance @xmath17 with current bias @xmath18 and magnetic field @xmath19 , where we observe clear oscillations in @xmath12 with magnetic flux . in this configuration , the modulation in @xmath12 is nearly 100  % , as seen by the individual @xmath20 traces in figure  [ fig : squid]e . </S>",
    "<S> the slow decay in the maximum value of @xmath12 arises due to the ( fraunhofer ) magnetic field response of a single junction . </S>",
    "<S> the devices were designed such that this background was negligible around @xmath21 ( i.e. , the squid loop area was kept much larger than the jj area ) . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing this background is important for a reliable determination of the cpr , as we will see below .     </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath22 for @xmath23  v and @xmath24  v , @xmath25  v and @xmath26  v at 40  mk . </S>",
    "<S> solid black lines are results from rcsj simulations of the squid . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) variation of supercurrent @xmath27 with phase @xmath28 extracted from the top curve in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 indicates the phase at which @xmath30 reaches a maximum , and is noticeably different from @xmath31 , indicating a forward skewed cpr.[fig : cpr ] ]    we now turn our attention to the flux - dependent response of a highly asymmetric squid ( @xmath32 ) , a condition which can be readily achieved by tuning the gate voltages appropriately . to outline the working principle of the device , we start with the assumption that both jjs have a sinusoidal cpr ( a more general treatment can be found in the si ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , the critical current of the squid can be written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the phase drop across l - jj ( r - jj ) . </S>",
    "<S> when an external magnetic flux ( @xmath22 ) threads through the squid loop , the flux and phase are related by @xmath36 , assuming the loop inductance is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> now , when @xmath32 the phase difference across r - jj is very close to @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath37 and the flux - dependence of @xmath38 directly represents the cpr of l - jj , i.e. , @xmath39 , where @xmath30 is the supercurrent through l - jj and @xmath28 is the phase drop across it . </S>",
    "<S> this principle of using an asymmetric squid to probe the cpr has been employed in the past for systems such as point contacts  @xcite and vertical graphene jjs  @xcite , where an sis junction ( with a well known sinusoidal cpr ) was used as the reference junction . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the reference junction is also a graphene jj , where the cpr is not known a priori . </S>",
    "<S> we show ( see si ) that this does not affect our ability to probe the cpr , provided time reversal symmetry is not broken , meaning that the cpr satisfies the condition @xmath40  @xcite . throughout the remainder of the text we use r - jj as the reference junction ( larger critical current ) , and l - jj </S>",
    "<S> is the junction under study ( smaller critical current ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : cpr]a shows the typical magnetic response of the asymmetric squid at @xmath41  mk , with @xmath42  v ( fixed ) and different values of @xmath2 . for the most asymmetric configuration ( @xmath43  v ) @xmath12 oscillates around a fixed value of roughly 6  @xmath6a ( @xmath3 ) with an amplitude of about 500  na ( @xmath4 ) . using the arguments described above </S>",
    "<S> , this @xmath44 curve can be converted to @xmath45 , as shown in figure  [ fig : cpr]b . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is the normalized supercurrent defined as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that there is an uncertainty ( less than one period ) in the exact position of zero @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this , combined with the unknown cpr of the reference graphene jj , makes it important to do this conversion carefully , and we describe the details in the si . </S>",
    "<S> the cpr shows a clear deviation from a sinusoidal form , showing a prominent forward skewing ( i.e. , @xmath30 peaks at @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define the skewness of the cpr as @xmath48  @xcite , where @xmath29 is the phase for which the supercurrent is maximum .    to be certain that we are indeed measuring the cpr of l - jj , we perform some important checks . </S>",
    "<S> we keep @xmath4 fixed and reduce @xmath3 ( by reducing @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : cpr]a shows that reducing @xmath3 merely shifts the @xmath49 downwards and therefore does not affect the extracted cpr , as one would expect . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we use the experimentally determined cpr ( from figure  [ fig : cpr]b ) , the junction asymmetry , and loop inductance as inputs for the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model to compute the expected squid response ( see si for details of the simulations ) . these plots ( solid lines ) </S>",
    "<S> show an excellent agreement between simulations and experiment , thus confirming that the asymmetry of our squid is sufficient to reliably estimate the cpr of l - jj . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it shows that there are no significant effects of inductance in our measurements , which could potentially complicate the extraction of the cpr from @xmath44 in an asymmetric squid  @xcite .     as a function of carrier density @xmath50 for dev1 and dev2 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger geometric asymmetry of dev2 ( see text ) allows one to reliably probe the cpr up to higher n - doping . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows the variation of @xmath4 with density . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath51 oscillates with carrier density in the p - doped regime in anti - phase with fabry prot oscillations in the resistance.[fig : cpr2 ] ]    to study the gate dependence of the cpr we fix @xmath2 at + 10  v ( to maximize @xmath3 ) and study the change in @xmath51 with @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : cpr2]a ) for dev1 and dev2 . for both devices </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath51 is larger on the n - side as compared to the p - side , showing a dip close to the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> we note that dev2 allows us to probe the cpr up to a larger range on the n - side due to its larger geometric asymmetry ( see si for other measurements on dev2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the skewness to depend strongly on the total transmission through the graphene jj , which should depend on ( a ) the number of conducting channels in the graphene , as well as ( b ) the transparency of the graphene - superconductor interface . </S>",
    "<S> the gate voltage @xmath1 obviously changes the fermi wave vector , but it also changes the contact resistance  @xcite , which plays a significant role in determining @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen most clearly for dev2 for high n - doping , where @xmath51 saturates , despite the fact that @xmath4 continues to increase up to the largest measured density ( see inset ) . at large </S>",
    "<S> p - doping @xmath51 also seems to saturate , but a closer look ( figure  [ fig : cpr2]b ) shows that @xmath51 oscillates in anti - phase with the fp oscillations in resistance . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that in this regime the cpr is modulated by phase coherent interference effects similar to the fp oscillations which affect the total transmission .        </S>",
    "<S> we complement our measurements with a minimal theoretical model by solving the corresponding bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations to calculate the cpr in graphene jjs . to set the stage </S>",
    "<S> , we note that sns junctions can be characterized by the quasiparticle mean free path @xmath52 in the normal ( n ) region and the coherence length @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fermi velocity in n. in our devices @xmath55 , i.e. , they are in the ballistic regime , and therefore we neglect impurity scattering in our calculations . taking @xmath56  </S>",
    "<S> m / s for graphene and @xmath57  mev for more , one finds @xmath58  nm , which means that in our junctions @xmath59 , i.e. , they are not in the strict short junction limit @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the josephson current is carried not only by discrete andreev bound states ( abss ) , but also by states in the continuum ( cont )  @xcite . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we numerically solve the bdg equations using a tight - binding ( tb ) model ( see figure  [ fig : theory]a ) and a recently developed numerical approach  @xcite which handles the abss and states in the continuum on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> the description of both the normal region and the superconducting terminals is based on the nearest - neighbor tb model of graphene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site complex pair - potential @xmath61 is finite only in the superconducting terminals and changes as a step - function at the n - s interface . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here are calculated using the top - contact geometry ( figure  [ fig : theory]a ) , a model with perfect edge contacts is discussed in the si . as observed experimentally , we take into account @xmath50-doping from the superconducting contacts ( see figure  [ fig : theory]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the junction is gated into hole - doping , a fp cavity is formed by the two @xmath10 junctions in the vicinity of the left and right superconducting terminals . </S>",
    "<S> the length @xmath62 of this fp cavity depends on the gate voltage  @xcite , for stronger hole - doping the n - p junctions shift closer to the contacts . for further details of the model </S>",
    "<S> see si .    turning now to the cpr calculations , figure  [ fig : theory]b shows separately the contribution of the abs and the continuum to the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath63 , the latter contribution is not negligible and affects both the value of the critical current and the skewness of the cpr . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory]c we show the calculated skewness @xmath51 as a function of the doping of the junction at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three regimes : ( i ) strongly @xmath9-doped junction ; ( ii ) large @xmath50-doping , ( iii ) the region around the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the discussion of ( i ) . it is well established that in this case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9-@xmath50 junctions lead to fp oscillations in the normal resistance as well as in the critical current  @xcite of graphene jjs . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations , shown in figure  [ fig : theory]d , indicate that due to fp interference the skewness also displays oscillations as a function of doping around an average value of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned , similar oscillations are present in the normal state resistance @xmath7 , however , we find that @xmath7 oscillates in antiphase with the skewness . compared to the measurements ( figure  [ fig : cpr2]b ) , our calculations therefore reproduce the phase relation between the oscillations of the skewness and @xmath7 and give a qualitatively good agreement with the measured values of the skewness . in the strong @xmath50-doped regime ( case ii ) the calculated average skewness of @xmath65 is larger than for @xmath9-doped junctions , and very close to the measured values . </S>",
    "<S> small oscillations of @xmath51 are still present in our results and they are due to the @xmath50-@xmath66 interfaces , i.e. , the difference in the doping close to the contacts ( for @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) in figure  [ fig : theory]a and the junction region ( @xmath69 ) , which enhances backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations therefore predict smaller skewness for @xmath9-doped than for @xmath50-doped junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of @xmath51 in the @xmath50-doped regime can be clearly seen in the measurements of figure  [ fig : cpr2]a . </S>",
    "<S> we note that previous theoretical work  @xcite , which calculated the spatial dependence of the pairing amplitude self - consistently , predicted a skewness of @xmath70 for @xmath50-doped samples with @xmath71 , while a non - self - consistent calculation which took into account only the contribution of the abs yielded @xmath72  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of these results to ours , and to the measurements , suggest that the skewness may depend quite sensitively on the s - n interface as well as on the @xmath73 ratio and that our approach captures the most important effects in these junctions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly discuss the case ( iii ) , where the measurements show a suppression of the skewness as the cnp is approached . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values of @xmath74 are similar to those found in diffusive junctions  @xcite , but significantly lower than the theoretical prediction of @xmath75 in the short junction limit  @xcite at the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression of @xmath51 is not reproduced in our calculations , instead , we find rapid oscillations as the cnp is approached from the @xmath9-doped regime . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is likely to be due to effects that are not included in our ballistic model , such as charged scatterers which are poorly screened in this regime , or scattering at the edges , which is more relevant at low densities when only a few open channels are present .    finally , we study the effect of temperature on the cpr of these jjs . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : temp]a , we compare the cpr in the n - doped regime ( @xmath76  v ; @xmath77  @xmath78 ) at 40  mk and 4.2  k. one clearly sees that at 4.2  k the cpr is sinusoidal . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our observation that the critical current modulation of the squid is nearly 100  % at 4.2  k ( figure  [ fig : squid]d ) , a condition which can only be achieved if the cpr is sinusoidal . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : temp]b shows the full temperature dependence of @xmath51 for two representative values of electron and hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in skewness with temperature is a consequence of the fact that the higher frequency terms in the cpr arise due to the phase coherent transfer of multiple cooper pairs and involve longer quasiparticle paths  @xcite , thereby making them more sensitive to temperature . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> their amplitude decreases quickly with increasing temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical estimates show the same qualitative behavior , however the experimentally determined skewness reaches zero ( sinusoidal cpr ) faster than the numerics . at this point </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to ascertain the exact reason for this discrepancy , but one possible explanation for this is that the induced superconducting gap in the graphene is somewhat smaller than the bulk more gap , resulting in a faster decay .    </S>",
    "<S> = + 1 v ( @xmath77  @xmath78 ) at 40 mk ( upper curve ) and 4.2  k ( lower curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> solid line shows the calculated cpr . </S>",
    "<S> a forward skewness is clearly seen in the curve at 40  mk but is absent at 4.2  k. ( b ) variation of @xmath51 with temperature for electron and hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the temperature suppresses higher harmonics in the cpr , thereby reducing @xmath51 until it vanishes near 4.2  k and the curves become sinusoidal . </S>",
    "<S> black lines show the results of tight binding simulations . ]    in conclusion , we have used a fully gate - tunable graphene based squid to provide measurements of the current - phase relation in ballistic josephson junctions made with encapsulated graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cpr is non - sinusoidal and can be controlled by a gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we complement our experiments with tight binding simulations to show that the nature of the superconductor - graphene interface plays an important role in determining the cpr . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the simplicity of our device architecture and measurement scheme should make it possible to use such devices for studies of the cpr in topologically non - trivial graphene josephson junctions .    </S>",
