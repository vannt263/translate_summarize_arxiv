    "to understand how quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) works remains one of the great challenges in nuclear physics today .",
    "the challenge arises from the fact that the degrees of freedom observed in nature , hadrons and nuclei , are not the same as the ones appearing in the qcd lagrangian , quarks and gluons .",
    "the challenge is then to formulate a connection between the description of hard , or short - distance , scattering processes which can be calculated perturbatively in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom and their weak couplings , and soft , or long - distance , scattering processes , where the physical asymptotic states are prominent and the quarks and gluons interact strongly .    given these strong quark - gluon interactions , or the large value of the strong coupling constant @xmath4 , the spectra of the asymptotic hadron states are not calculable within a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) framework , and are difficult to directly connect to the underlying quark - gluon or parton dynamics . yet ,",
    "several instances exist in nature where the behavior of low - energy scattering cross sections , averaged over appropriate energy intervals , closely coincide with asymptotically high - energy scattering cross sections , calculated in terms of quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _ quark - hadron duality _ , and may be a general property of quantum field theories with inherent weak and strong coupling limits , with qcd as a prime example .    the observation of a non - trivial relationship between inclusive electron ",
    "nucleon scattering cross sections at low energy , in the region dominated by the nucleon resonances , and that in the deep inelastic scaling regime at high energy predates qcd itself . while analyzing the data from the early deep inelastic scattering experiments at slac , bloom and gilman observed @xcite that the inclusive structure function at low hadronic final state mass , @xmath5 , generally follows a global scaling curve which describes high-@xmath5 data , and to which the resonance structure function averages .",
    "following the development of qcd in the early 1970s , bloom ",
    "gilman duality was reformulated in terms of an operator product ( _ twist _ ) expansion of moments of the structure functions @xcite .",
    "this allowed a systematic classification of terms responsible for duality and its violations in terms of so - called _ higher - twist _ operators which describe long - range interactions between quarks and gluons .",
    "however , this description could not explain _ why _ particular multi - parton correlations were suppressed , and _ how _ the physics of resonances gave way to scaling @xcite .",
    "since then , with the development of high luminosity beams at modern accelerator facilities such as jlab , a wealth of new information on structure functions , with unprecedented accuracy and over a wide range of kinematics , has become available .",
    "one of the striking findings of the new jlab data @xcite is that bloom - gilman duality appears to work exceedingly well , down to @xmath6 values as low as 1  gev@xmath7 or even below .",
    "this is considerably lower than previously believed , and well into the region where @xmath4 is relatively large .",
    "furthermore , the equivalence of the averaged resonance and scaling structure functions appeared to hold for each resonance , over restricted regions in @xmath5 , so that the resonance  scaling duality holds also locally .",
    "it was also found that quark - hadron duality manifests itself in the separated proton transverse ( @xmath8 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath9 ) structure functions .",
    "the more recent jlab resonance structure function studies have revealed an important application of duality : if the workings of the resonance  deep inelastic interplay are sufficiently well understood , the region of high bjorken-@xmath0 ( @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the hadron carried by the parton in the infinite momentum frame ) would become accessible to quantitative studies .",
    "this region remains largely unexplored experimentally due to the requirement of high - energy beams with sufficiently high luminosity .",
    "the @xmath11 region is an important testing ground for nonperturbative and perturbative mechanisms underpinning valence quark dynamics , and is vital to map out if we hope to achieve a complete description of nucleon structure .",
    "data from the nucleon resonance region , where quark - hadron duality has been established , could be used to better constrain qcd parameterizations of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , from which also the hadronic backgrounds in high - energy collisions are computed @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath0 region also constitutes an appreciable amount of the moments of polarized and unpolarized structure functions , especially for the higher moments .",
    "it is precisely these moments that can be calculated from first principles in qcd on the lattice @xcite , in terms of matrix elements of local operators .",
    "note that , since the @xmath0 dependence of structure functions can not be calculated on the lattice directly , one can not easily use the lattice to learn about the degree to which duality holds locally .",
    "indeed , the ability to calculate a leading - twist moment on the lattice implicitly uses quark - hadron duality to average the resonance contributions to a smooth , scaling function .    in this article , we quantitatively study the application of quark - hadron duality to access parton dynamics in the region of large @xmath0 , up to @xmath0 @xmath3 0.9 .",
    "for this , we accumulated a series of inclusive electron - proton and electron - deuteron scattering data in the nucleon resonance region ( @xmath12 @xmath13 4 gev@xmath2 ) , at the highest momentum transfers accessible at jlab .",
    "these data are at values of @xmath6 far above where duality was quantitatively found to be valid in previous jlab experiments .",
    "the extracted @xmath14 structure function data are also compared with various state - of - the - art parameterizations of @xmath14 world data to improve our understanding of parton dynamics at large values of bjorken @xmath0 .",
    "the article is structured in five sections .",
    "section 2 summarizes techniques of modeling the dynamics of the nucleon in terms of structure functions computed from pdfs and examines in detail few representative parameterizations of the nucleon @xmath15 structure function focusing on the large @xmath0 region .",
    "section 3 is an overview of the experimental apparatus utilized to collect these experimental data and of the analysis steps taken to extract the cross section and the @xmath15 structure function . in section 4",
    "we present our studies of the application of quark - hadron duality to gain insight in the parton dynamics at large @xmath0 . in section 5",
    "we draw conclusions .",
    "the purpose of this section is to give an overview of the techniques typically employed to map out the dynamics of the nucleon via structure functions .",
    "this discussion points out the importance , but also the difficulty , of obtaining a parameterization of the @xmath15 structure function for the entire kinematic range .",
    "in particular , the exclusion of data in regions where the perturbative qcd mechanisms are not the only ones expected to contribute , greatly limits the applicability of these parameterizations and also our knowledge of the nucleon structure . in this context , quark - hadron duality might be the tool which could open kinematic regions not easily accessible otherwise to detailed studies .",
    "four representative parameterizations will be examined in detail with an emphasis on the large @xmath0 region : allm97 @xcite , cteq6 m @xcite , mrst2004 @xcite and alekhin @xcite .",
    "these parameterizations were used in our duality studies which will be presented in sect .",
    "lastly , the parameterization of the structure function @xmath16 from bourrely _",
    "@xcite will also be considered .",
    "this parameterization is obtained from parton distribution functions constructed in a statistical physical picture of the nucleon , where the nucleon is viewed as a gas of massless partons ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) in equilibrium at a given temperature in a finite size volume .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the parton distributions is chosen to correspond to a fermi - dirac distribution for quarks and antiquarks , and to a bose - einstein distribution for gluons .",
    "the parameterization involves a total of eight free parameters which are constrained by fitting high @xmath12 data from various experiments : nmc , bcdms , e665 , zeus , ccfr .",
    "a comparison of @xmath16 from bourrely _ et al . _ to results from cteq6 m and allm97 will be shown in sect .",
    "* empirical parameterization of @xmath16 : allm97*. allm97 , proposed as an update of allm @xcite published in 1991 , is a regge motivated parameterization extended to the large @xmath6 regime in a way compatible with qcd expectations .",
    "the data set used to obtain the allm97 fit coefficients included all @xmath17p measurements published up to 1997 , with @xmath18 @xmath19 3 gev@xmath7 , and covering a wide range in @xmath6 , 0 @xmath20 @xmath1 @xmath20 5000 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the allm97 fit function has a total of 23 parameters , half of which are needed for the description of the low @xmath18 ( high @xmath0 ) region where higher - twist terms are expected to be important .",
    "there are two important aspects to be noted in relation to the behavior of the allm97 parameterization at large @xmath0 ( see figs .",
    "1 and 2 ) .     parameterizations at a @xmath6 value of 4 gev@xmath7 .",
    "cteq6 m @xcite , mrst2004 @xcite , allm97 @xcite and alekhin @xcite were used for the quark - hadron duality studies presented in sect .",
    "4 . target mass corrections were added to cteq6 m and mrst2004 ( see text ) .",

    "4 . target mass corrections were added to cteq6 m and mrst2004 ( see text ) . the m.e .",
    "christy @xcite parameterization is shown for comparison.,width=340 ]    on one hand , the data set used to obtain the fit coefficients is selected with a rather low @xmath18 cut .",
    "thus , it is expected that , if duality holds _ globally _ , the extrapolation of allm97 below @xmath18 of 3 gev@xmath7 in the resonance region will work reasonably well , _ on average_. on the other hand , allm97 being an empirical fit , some of its shortcomings like unconstrained @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence or inability to fully account for target mass effects will become obvious as we probe kinematic regimes outside its domain of applicability .",
    "this will most likely be revealed in a clear manner when extrapolating to low @xmath12 regions .",
    "* qcd parameterization of @xmath16*. starting from two basic ideas of pqcd , _ factorization _ and _ evolution _ , the @xmath16 structure function can be calculated from pdfs extracted from hard - scattering data @xcite .",
    "the theorem of factorization of long - distance from short - distance dependence in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) allows for the structure function to be expressed as a generalization of the parton model results : @xmath21 where _ i _ denotes a sum over all partons ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) inside the proton , @xmath22 are coefficient functions _ independent _ of the long - distance effects while @xmath23 are parton distributions sensitive to the nonperturbative , long - distance effects inside the proton @xcite .",
    "the evolution , on the other hand , enables the systematic , perturbative computation of logarithmic scale - braking effects and ensures that measuring @xmath24(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) is enough to predict not only @xmath24(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) but also @xmath24(@xmath0,@xmath25 ) for all @xmath25 , assuming that both @xmath1 and @xmath25 are large enough that a perturbative expansion in @xmath4 is still appropriate .",
    "this is typically done by using the dglap evolution equations to evolve the parton distributions : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the evolution kernels ( splitting functions ) given by a perturbative expansion in @xmath4 , beginning with the leading order ( lo ) @xmath28 but also calculable to higher orders , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) or next - to - next - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "the kernels have the physical interpretation as probability densities of obtaining a parton of type _",
    "i _ from one of type _",
    "j _ carrying a fraction of the parent parton s momentum .",
    "thus , the three basic quantities are the coefficient functions @xmath29 , the evolution kernels @xmath27 and the pdfs @xmath23 . of these , the first two",
    "are computed perturbatively as power series in @xmath4 .",
    "the physical non - perturbative parton distributions are extracted by combining theory and experiment and performing qcd fits . in a typical qcd fitting procedure",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the parton distributions is parameterized at some low scale , @xmath30 , where higher - order corrections in @xmath4 are expected to be negligible , and then a fixed order ( either lo or nlo or nnlo ) dglap evolution is performed to specify the distributions at higher scales where data exist .",
    "a global fit to the data then determines the parameters of the input distributions .",
    "there is considerable freedom in choosing the parametric form of the parton distributions at scale @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the parameterization should be general enough to accommodate all possible @xmath0 .",
    "a typical choice is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a smooth function of @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 determines the small and large @xmath0 behavior , respectively , and @xmath35 are coefficients to be determined from fits to data .",
    "when performing qcd fits , there are several conceptual difficulties to take into account .",
    "first of all , a qcd analysis of @xmath15 measurements involves the use of the gluon distribution which is , a priori , unknown .",
    "in fact , the gluon distribution is the most uncertain of the pdfs and is particularly ill - determined for @xmath0 @xmath19 0.3 , with uncertainties reaching 200% by @xmath0 = 0.5 @xcite .",
    "this in turn translates in an uncertainty in the @xmath4 determination from qcd analysis of pdfs since there is a correlation between the _ hardness _ of the gluon and the magnitude of @xmath36 , the quantity which sets the scale for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 measurements should be able to provide a precise value of @xmath36 since the gluon distribution does not enter into the evolution .",
    "however , the experimental uncertainties of @xmath37 are still larger than those of @xmath15 and discrepancies in extracting @xmath37 were observed between different experiments in the region of @xmath0 @xmath19 0.4 @xcite .",
    "then , it should be pointed out that , a standard qcd analysis of pdfs does not take into account all residual @xmath1 effects arising , for example , from higher - order radiative corrections in @xmath4 or / and non - perturbative higher - twist corrections . in particular ,",
    "the higher - twist terms are non - factorisable and process dependent and qcd has no rigorous prescription to account for it . as a result , most pdfs extractions are performed using _ safe _ kinematic cuts for data selection in order to exclude regions where higher - twist or / and higher - order corrections in @xmath4 play an important role .",
    "a typical set of cuts employed to select data for fitting is @xmath1 @xmath19 2 gev@xmath2 and @xmath12 @xmath19 12 gev@xmath2 ( this type of @xmath12 cut rejects the whole resonance region ) .",
    "limiting the data coverage to a particular range in @xmath1 and @xmath12 will result in a limitation in the @xmath0 coverage .",
    "for example , for a fixed @xmath1 , a @xmath12 cut of @xmath12 @xmath19 @xmath38 will limit the @xmath0 range to @xmath0 @xmath13 @xmath1/(@xmath38 - @xmath39 + @xmath1 ) . considering that the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs is parameterized empirically , as exemplified in eq . 3 , and that the parameterization coefficients are extracted from fits to data , these data selection cuts , though they make possible the extraction of pdfs without the complications specified above , yield to unconstrained strengths of the pdfs at large @xmath0 @xcite .    to date , the large experimental uncertainties in the large @xmath0 regime , when excluding the low @xmath12 data , prevent answers to basic questions as to why the @xmath40 quark distribution appears to be _",
    "softer _ than the @xmath41 quark distribution .",
    "for the same reason , the @xmath40/@xmath41 behavior at large @xmath0 , a critical test of the mechanism of spin - flavor symmetry breaking , is highly unconstrained .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of pdfs at large @xmath0 is essential for determining high - energy cross sections at collider energies such as in search of new physics beyond the standard model , where structure information at large @xmath0 feeds down through perturbative @xmath1 evolution to lower @xmath0 and higher values of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of paramount importance to decrease the uncertainties in the extraction of pdfs by deriving the parameterizations directly from data without resorting to theoretical assumptions alone for the extrapolation to @xmath0 @xmath3 1 .",
    "extending to larger @xmath0 at a finite @xmath1 means encountering the resonance region .",
    "an important consequence of duality is that the resonance and deep inelastic regions are deeply connected and properly averaged resonance region data could facilitate our understanding of the deep inelastic region .",
    "in some of the qcd analysis performed , the higher - twist terms have been extracted from data selected with a kinematic cut of @xmath12 @xmath19 10 gev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in several analyses @xcite that only a relatively small higher - twist contribution consistent with the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite would be necessary to describe the entire @xmath15 structure function spectrum .",
    "indeed , s. liuti _",
    "analyzed resonance region data within a fixed-@xmath12 framework .",
    "this study found that the higher - twist contributions in the resonance region are similar to those from @xmath12 @xmath19 10 gev@xmath7 , with the exception of @xmath42 region where the effects seem to be larger .",
    "this is in no way surprising if one thinks of it as a consequence of quark - hadron duality which ensures that , on average , higher - twists are small or cancel . as a consequence of duality",
    ", the wealth of resonance region data could be utilized to access the large @xmath0 region and constrain the pdfs in this regime .",
    "this approach , however , requires a very good understanding of the @xmath1 dependence of the data in these kinematic regions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 where the perturbative evolution is no more the only mechanism responsible for the @xmath1 behavior .",
    "figures 1 and 2 depict three pqcd parameterizations of the @xmath15 structure function at two @xmath1 values , 4 and 8 gev@xmath2 , with a zoom - in of the large-@xmath0 region .",
    "the cteq6 m parameterization shown is a qcd fit to hard scattering and dis data ( bcdms , nmc , ccfr , e605 , cdf , h1 , zeus , d0 ) with @xmath1 @xmath19 4 gev@xmath2 and @xmath12 @xmath19 12.25 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs is parameterized at a @xmath1 of 1.3 gev@xmath2 and then the qcd evolution equations are utilized to evolve the distributions at higher q@xmath2 in the nlo ( and lo ) .",
    "the authors employed the twist-2 pqcd formalism so the kinematic cuts used for data selection were tested to ensure that the introduction of simple phenomenological higher twist terms would not improve significantly the quality of the fit .",
    "the cteq6 m fit shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 is obtained in the @xmath43 ( modified minimal subtraction ) factorization scheme .",
    "one of the main improvements over earlier cteq fits is the addition to the global set of data of new measurements ( h1 , zeus , d0 ) which provide better constraints on the pdfs , in general , and on the gluon distribution at large @xmath0 , the result being a harder gluon distribution in this region .",
    "the other noteworthy improvement is the full treatment of uncertainties of the pdfs and their physical predictions , using an eigenvector - basis approach .",
    "the mrst2004 parameterization is a qcd fit to a wide set of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data ( bcdms , slac , nmc , ccfr , cdf , h1 , zeus , hera , d0 ) with @xmath1 @xmath19 2 gev@xmath2 and @xmath12 @xmath19 12.5 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs is parameterized at @xmath1 of 1 gev@xmath2 and a fixed order , lo or nlo or nnlo , qcd evolution is performed to specify the distributions at larger @xmath1 where data exist .",
    "a global fit to the data then determines the parameters of the input distributions .",
    "though the fits are performed in the standard @xmath43 scheme , the gluon distribution is parameterized in the dis ( deep - inelastic scattering ) factorization scheme and then transformed to the @xmath43 scheme . together with more precise calculations of the splitting functions up to nnlo",
    ", this is actually the main improvement over earlier mrst fits ( mrst2001 @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the nlo global analysis with this new gluon parameterization appears to work extremely well when compared to tevatron jet data and is even better for the nnlo fit .",
    "this objective could nt be accomplished by previous mrst parameterizations .",
    "both cteq6 m and mrst2004 are shown here with target mass corrections ( tmc ) included according to ref .",
    "cteq6 m has more strength at large @xmath0 than mrst2004 . for most part , this discrepancy originates from the fact that the two groups use different functional forms for the parameterization of the non - perturbative input parton distributions and neither parameterization is constrained by measurements in the large @xmath0 regime .",
    "the alekhin parameterization shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 is an update of an earlier parameterization @xcite , the significant improvement being the use of recent calculations of the exact nnlo evolution kernel .",
    "the data used were from slac , bcdms , nmc , hera , h1 , zeus with kinematic cuts of @xmath1 @xmath19 2.5 gev@xmath2 , @xmath12 @xmath19 3.24 gev@xmath2 and x @xmath13 0.75 .",
    "the model for the data description was based on pqcd with phenomenological parameterization of the twist-2 and higher - twist contributions to the structure functions .",
    "the analysis was performed in the @xmath43 scheme with the number of flavors fixed at 3 .",
    "the twist-2 pdfs were parameterized at @xmath1 = 9 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the pqcd analysis was done up to nnlo . given the rather low @xmath12",
    "cut used to select the data set , alekhin parameterization includes , besides the typical parameters of pqcd , parameters to account for the target mass and dynamical higher - twist effects .",
    "this is a novelty , considering the standard procedure of performing qcd fits .",
    "the higher - twist contributions to the structure function were parameterized in additive form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 has contributions from the twist-2 terms with target mass corrections included according to ref . @xcite and the dynamical twist-4 term @xmath46 is parameterized in a model - independent way as a piece - linear function of @xmath0 .",
    "the use of the exact nnlo corrections made possible an improvement in the positivity of the gluon distributions extrapolated to small @xmath0 and @xmath47 : in this parameterization the gluon distributions are positive up to @xmath1 = 1 gev@xmath2 , i.e. throughout the kinematic region where the parton model proved to be applicable . since the alekhin parameterization is based on fits to data with lower @xmath12 than cteq6 m and mrst2004 , its pdfs are expected to be better constrained at large @xmath0 .",
    "* parameterizations of f@xmath48*. the parameterizations discussed above provide parton distribution functions from which the nucleon structure function can be constructed in qcd frame - work .",

    "moreover , it assumes no @xmath1-dependence , a need for which has been indicated in other works @xcite .",
