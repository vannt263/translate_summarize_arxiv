    "investigation of mutual interaction between electrons and magnetization is a key subject in the field of spintronics.@xcite spinmotive force ( smf ) is an emerging concept,@xcite where spin current and electric voltage are induced in a ferromagnet due to the exchange coupling between electrons and the magnetization .",
    "the smf provides an important ground for the basic study of the electron - magnetization interaction,@xcite as well as a new concept for spintronic devices.@xcite the smf is described by the so - called spin electric field , which accelerates electrons in opposite directions depending on their spin , giving rise to a spin current in the ferromagnet and then an electric voltage . until recently ,",
    "adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions to the spin electric field have been derived , which depend on both @xmath0 and @xmath1,@xcite where @xmath2 is the classical unit vector of the magnetization direction , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the derivatives with respect to time and space , respectively .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the smfs is confined in time - varying and spatially nonuniform magnetization regions , such as moving domain walls,@xcite vortex cores,@xcite and asymmetrically patterned films.@xcite recently , it has been pointed out that in a system with rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling there exist additional spin electric fields relying only on @xmath0.@xcite the discoveries have enabled us to generate a smf in time - varying but spatially uniform magnetic structures , such as ferromagnetic resonance systems .    in this work the theory of smf is further extended in a system with so coupling , in which a sample is subjected to electric fields that can vary in time .",
    "we predict a new smf relying on neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 ; a new spin electric field is found to be proportional to @xmath5 , with @xmath6 a u(1 ) electric field .",
    "thus the smf can be generated due to time - varying electric fields with static and uniform magnetization .",
    "this smf has two advantages compared with the other forms of smfs .",
    "( i ) the electrical measurement of the smf is free from the inductive voltage because of no dynamical magnetization .",
    "( ii ) the smf can be tuned by the electric fields free from the characteristic frequencies inherent in ferromagnets , such as the ferromagnetic resonance frequency .",
    "we demonstrate the smf in two systems : electric voltage measurement in a single ferromagnet and spin injection from a ferromagnet into nonmagnetic conductor .",
    "in a nonrelativistic limit up to the order of @xmath7 with @xmath8 the speed of light , the hamiltonian of a conduction electron in a ferromagnetic conductor is written by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron s mass and charge .",
    "the second term represents the exchange interaction between the electron spin and the magnetization , with @xmath12 the exchange coupling energy and @xmath13 the pauli s matrices . in the third term",
    "we introduce a so interaction , with the so coupling parameter @xmath14 for the free electron model , but in real materials @xmath15 can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude.@xcite the magnetization @xmath2 and the electric field @xmath6 are in general dependent on time and space .    to derive smfs , let us investigate the equation of motion for the conduction electron . the velocity operator @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 = { \\bm p}/m_{\\rm e } + ( e\\eta_{\\rm so}/\\hbar){\\bm \\sigma}\\times{\\bm e}$ ] , where the second term in the last line is the so - called anomalous velocity .",
    "the  force \" @xmath18 acting on the electron is given by @xmath19 + \\partial(m_{\\rm e}{\\bm v})/\\partial t$ ] , which is explicitly expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{ff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) is just the spatial gradient of the potential energy @xmath21 , while the second term originates from the time derivative of the anomalous velocity .",
    "the third term is due to the noncommutating nature of the anomalous velocity and the exchange coupling energy .",
    "equation  ( [ ff ] ) is an su(2 ) operator containing the pauli matrices @xmath13 that play as the electron spin operators .",
    "next , the expectation value of the force @xmath22 is calculated by determining the electron spin dynamics @xmath23 , where @xmath24 stands for a one electron state with momentum @xmath25 and majority ( @xmath26 ) or minority ( @xmath27 ) spin .",
    "it is assumed that the electron spin dynamics is described by a bloch - type equation of motion , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relaxation time for the electron spin flip , and @xmath30 represents a misalignment between the electron spin and the magnetization , which is defined as @xmath31 . the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) is the larmor precession around the magnetization @xmath2 caused by the exchange coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "the second term arises because of the so coupling with impurities , other electrons and so on , describing a damping motion towards @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for the majority ( minority ) spin .",
    "equation  ( [ eom ] ) implicitly assumes the condition @xmath34 , where the electron spin dynamics is mostly dominated by @xmath2 due to the relatively strong exchange coupling , while the so interaction still plays an important role causing the relaxation motion through the nonadiabatic spin flip process .",
    "the misalignment @xmath35 is essential for @xmath22 , although in general it is small compared to the component @xmath36 .",
    "one can easily see that the values , @xmath37 and @xmath38|{\\bm k}\\pm\\rangle$ ] , appearing in the force are zero if @xmath39 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can decompose @xmath40 into two directions perpendicular to the magnetization as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are spin - dependent constants , and @xmath44 is the lagrange derivative as @xmath45 . by substituting @xmath23 with this expression of @xmath35 into eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) and comparing the left - hand and right - hand sides , the explicit forms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined . in the process",
    ", the term @xmath46 , which is the order of @xmath47 , is discarded .",
    "the electron spin is in the end expressed in terms of the magnetization as@xcite @xmath48 . \\label{spin}\\ ] ]    substituting eq .",
    "( [ spin ] ) into the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spin electric field that is given by @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) the velocity - dependent terms are discarded , which include the spin magnetic fields causing the anomalous hall effect due to the scalar spin chirality@xcite and due to the so interaction.@xcite we now consider an open circuit condition where the ensemble average of @xmath52 is zero , and focus on the effects of the spin electric field @xmath50 .    the spin electric field ( [ es ] )",
    "accelerates the electrons with majority and minority spins in opposite directions to each other , giving rise to a spin current accompanied by an electric voltage .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) has been known as the origin of the conventional smf.@xcite the second term reflects the nonadiabaticity in the electron spin dynamics,@xcite which goes to zero in the adiabatic limit @xmath53 . since these two terms depend on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the appearance of the smfs due to these spin electric fields are spatially confined in time - varying and spatially nonuniform magnetization regions .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) , which contain the so parameter @xmath15 , do not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the fourth term , reflecting the nonadiabatic dynamics of the electron spin , was recently derived in the rashba so coupling systems based on the diagrammatic calculation.@xcite in ref .  , the spin electric field proportional to @xmath54 was found in the rashba so coupling systems , where the electric field @xmath6 due to the inversion asymmetry is assumed to be static .",
    "we found that this spin electric field is just a part of a spin electric field proportional to @xmath55 , i.e. , the third term in eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) ; there appears an additional spin electric field proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that since the new spin electric field can be induced with static and uniform magnetization , one can investigate the smf electrically in detail under no disturbance arising from the inductive voltage , in contrast to the other smfs . in addition , this term may be tuned via electric fields with variable frequencies , whereas the time depedence of the other terms are governed by the magnetization dynamics . in the following ,",
    "we propose two systems to demonstrate the smf .",
    "let us consider a thin film of ferromagnetic conductor , which has a static and uniform magnetic structure @xmath56 and is subjected to a space - independent ac electric field @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 the amplitude and the angular frequency of the electric field , respectively , and @xmath60 the unit vector along the @xmath61 axis ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or @xmath64 ) . here",
    "@xmath65 axis is set to be normal to the film plane [ see fig .  1(a ) ] . in this condition , eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) is reduced to @xmath66 our sample may be as thin as the order of the thomas - fermi screening length , i.e. , consisting of one or two atomic layers , so that external electric fields can survive to some extent inside the film though it is conducting . in another case , applying gate voltages allows one to control the intrinsic electric fields due to the inversion asymmetry in semiconductors.@xcite in this section , the electric voltage due to the spin electric field ( [ es2 ] ) is investigated .",
    "cc +   +    the difference in the electric conductivities of the majority and minority electrons , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , results in the charge current @xmath69 , which is given by @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the spin polarization defined as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the complex admittances should be used instead of the conductivities as we are considering the ac charge current . however , for simplicity here we consider a condition where the reactance of the circuit is small enough so that the admittances are well approximated by the conductivities .    in the open circuit condition , the charge current ( [ jc ] )",
    "is canceled by the electric charge rearrangement , giving rise to an electric potential distribution @xmath74 so that @xmath75 .",
    "the electric voltage @xmath76 appearing between the sample edges , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , is provided by @xmath79 the amplitude of the voltage can be tuned by the distance between the electrodes @xmath80 and the angular frequency of the electric field @xmath59 .",
    "notice that @xmath76 and @xmath6 vary in time with the same angular frequency @xmath59 , but their phases are different by @xmath81 since the spin electric field is proportional to the time derivative of @xmath6 ; @xmath82 , while @xmath83 , indicating that one can readily distinguish the smf signal from the possible anomalous hall voltage , which is proportional to @xmath6 itself .",
    "no inductive voltage appears in the present system because there is no dynamical magnetization .    in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , the time evolution of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) is shown together with that of the electric field .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath76 is @xmath8430 @xmath85v , adopting the typical parameters in a thin film of ferromagnetic metals : @xmath86 kg , @xmath87 m@xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 v / m , @xmath91 s@xmath92 , and @xmath93 mm .",
    "next , we investigate a spin injection method by using the spin electric field ( [ es2 ] ) .",
    "let us consider a nonmagnetic conductor ( n ) attached to the ferromagnet ( f ) , which has the in - plane magnetization and is subjected to the sinusoidally varying electric field as before [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] . in f layer , the spin electric field ( [ es2 ] )",
    "induces not only the charge current ( [ jc ] ) but also the spin current @xmath94 giving rise to a spin accumulation at the ends of f , which diffuses into n and decays within the spin diffusion length [ fig .",
    "the injected spin current into n , @xmath95 , is calculated below .",
    "the spin accumulations in f and n , @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the electrochemical potential for a electron with majority ( minority ) spin in f ( n ) , obeys the diffusion equation@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the spin diffusion length in f ( n ) . by substituting the spin electric field ( [ es2 ] ) , which appears only in f , into eq .",
    "( [ vf ] ) , the forms of the solutions are @xmath100 @xmath101 where the origin of the @xmath102 axis is located at the f / n interface . here",
    "we assume that n is much wider than @xmath103 in the @xmath102 direction , so that the spin accumulation at another end of n can be neglected .",
    "the coefficients @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are determined from the boundary conditions for the electrochemical potentials , @xmath107 , the spin current , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and the charge current that is zero both in f and n because of the open circuit condition .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a dimensionless parameter defined as @xmath113 with @xmath114 the electric conductivity of n. the spin current in n is given by @xmath115 which oscillates in time with the angular frequency @xmath59 . adopting the same parameters as before and @xmath116 @xmath85 m , @xmath117 nm , and @xmath118 ( 1 @xmath119 , the amplitude of @xmath120 at the f /",
    "n interface is @xmath84@xmath121 a / m@xmath88 .",
    "in conclusion , the theory of spinmotive force has been extended in a system with spin - orbit coupling , and a new spinmotive force was derived , which can be induced by time - varying electric fields with static and uniform magnetization .",
    "this spinmotive force has two advantages compared with the other smfs .",
    "( i ) the electrical measurement of the spinmotive force is free from the inductive voltage .",
    "( ii ) the spinmotive force can be tuned by the electric fields free from the characteristic frequencies inherent in ferromagnets such as the ferromagnetic resonance frequency .",
    "we have demonstrated the spinmotive force in two systems : electric voltage measurement in a single ferromagnet and spin injection from a ferromagnet into a nonmagnetic conductor .",
