    "recently several authors suggested that formation of black holes in very massive stars can be accompanied by a super - collapsar ( i.e , collapsar with a black hole mass higher than a few hundreds solar masses ) to produce relativistic jets  @xcite .",
    "given that the considered black holes are very massive compared to the case of ordinary gamma - ray bursts , there might be unique observational signatures from these super - collapars , depending on the details of the progenitor structure .",
    "for example , the amount of the total energy released by jets could be significantly larger than those of ordinary gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "one of the key conditions for having a collapsar event is rapid rotation of the infalling matter onto the black hole , of which the specific angular momentum must be high enough to form an accretion disk ( i.e. , @xmath12 for the black hole mass of 3 to 1000  @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the tayler - spruit ( ts ) dynamo @xcite plays a key role in transporting angular momentum inside stars . because of the efficient angular momentum transport from the convective core to the outer layers via magnetic torques , stars can maintain near - rigid rotation throughout the main sequence , and lose angular momentum via mass shedding as the surface reaches critical rotation .",
    "this effect becomes more important for a very massive pop iii star of which the surface luminosity is close to the eddington limit because it can reach the critical rotation even with a fairly low rotation velocity . as a result ,",
    "pop iii stars more massive than about 300  @xmath10 can not retain enough angular momentum to produce a super - collapsar , according to ydl12 .",

    "however , the efficiency of the ts dynamo is still a matter of debate in the community @xcite .",
    "the strong braking implied in low - mass stars might be instead related to some other mechanisms like internal gravity waves @xcite , which have not been well understood in the context of massive stars and thus might not be necessarily relevant . if the transport of angular momentum in massive stars is much less efficient than what is predicted with the ts dynamo , they could retain a large amount of angular momentum inside the core , while magnetic fields of large scales might be generated in convective layers before collapse or in the accretion disk after black hole formation , thus fulfilling the necessary conditions for super - collapsar .",
    "given the importance of super - collapsar events as a probe on the nature of pop iii stars , it is worthwhile to investigate this possibility in some detail to provide a theoretical boundary condition for super - collapsar progenitors . for this purpose , we present new evolutionary models of very massive pop iii stars ( @xmath15 ) without magnetic torques according to the ts dynamo .",

    "we used the one - dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code that is described in ydl12 and @xcite .",
    "this code implicitly solves the stellar structure equations for which the henyey - type method is adopted .",
    "the opal opacity table  @xcite is used for @xmath16  k and the prescription by @xcite for lower temperatures .",
    "we follow @xcite to consider the effect of the centrifugal force on the stellar scructure , and @xcite and @xcite for the redistribution of angular momentum , which is approximated as a diffusive process .",
    "we used the same physical parameters for convection , semi - convection and rotationally - induced chemical mixing and transport of angular momentum , but the ts dynamo is not included in the present study except for one model sequence .",
    "this means that the considered transport processes due to rotation include eddington - sweet circulations , the secular shear instability and the goldreich , schubert and fricke ( gsf ) instability as explained in @xcite .",
    "the overshooting is applied for 0.335 times local pressure scale heights above the convectively unstable core and the adopted semi - convection parameter ( @xmath17 ; @xcite ) is 1.0 , following @xcite . compared to ydl12 ,",
    "the nuclear network was improved to treat silicon burning as discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in some of our models ,",
    "the silicon burning was followed with 13 main isotopes . in this way the main alpha - chain can be described without considering neutronization that does not play an important role in the structure of very massive stars undergoing the pair - instability .",
    "the treatment of mass loss for pop iii stars and its physical justification are fully described in ydl12 . in short , the mass loss in our models is dominated by the centrifugally - driven mass shedding , which is treated as the following : @xmath18 \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\omega}\\right)^{0.43}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 the critical rotation @xmath20 represents the modified keplerian limit considering the effect of radiation when the stars approach the eddington limit , for which the eddington factor @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the wind mass loss rate for the non - rotating case , for which we followed @xcite and @xcite for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , with metallicity dependence of @xmath26 . here",
    ", the metallicity means the total mass fraction of cno elements at the surface , and in this way the enhancement of the mass loss rate resulting from surface enrichment of heavy elements by chemical mixing is taken into account ( see ydl12 for more discussion on this issue ) .",
    "before presenting the evolutionary models , here we discuss the properties of very massive pop iii stars on the zams . in table  1 , we provide the information on the zams models for the mass range of 300  20000  @xmath10 . here",
    "we assume that stars on the zams rotate as a solid body , which can be justified because of the expected rapid transport of angular momentum in chemically homogeneous stars by convection and eddington - sweet circulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the discussion below ) .",
    "the surface luminosities of these very massive stars are close to the eddington limit : the eddington factor varies from @xmath27 at 300  @xmath10 to @xmath28 at 20000  @xmath10 . in consequence",
    ", these stars can not have a very high critical rotation velocity , and the total amounts of angular momentum should be limited accordingly .",
    "the corresponding @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ; see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) with solid - body rotation changes from 0.48 to 0.06 .",
    "because the stellar radius is larger with higher mass , both the total angular momentum and the specific angular momentum at the critical rotation gradually increase with increasing mass up to about 10000  @xmath10 , despite the fact that @xmath29 decreases .",
    "however , @xmath29 becomes so small for 20000  @xmath10 that the specific angular momentum becomes smaller than that of 10000  @xmath10 star .",
    "another factor that limits the amount of angular momentum is the change of stellar structure as @xmath21 approaches zero .",
    "the dimensionless radius of gyration ( i.e. , @xmath31 ; see table  1 ) decreases with increasing mass and therefore the amount of angular momentum for a given set of @xmath20 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 should decrease as well .",
    "this property leads to the following important conclusion : pop iii stars with @xmath34  @xmath10 at their birth can not contain enough angular momentum in their cores to produce a collapsar because of the effect of high radiation pressure , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jzams ] .",
    "only the outermost layers have specific angular momentum above the critical limit in these stars , and therefore production of an energetic gamma - ray burst can not occur ( see discussion below ) . this fact is based only on the structure of pop iii stars on the zams , and does not depend on the uncertain physical processes like mass loss that has strong impact on the stellar evolution .",
    "this gives a strong upper mass limit for super - collapsar progenitors .",
    "given that @xmath35  @xmath10 is required to avoid a pair - instability explosion , only pop iii stars in the mass range of @xmath36  @xmath10 can be considered potential super - collapsar progenitors that can produce an energetic gamma - ray burst , in terms of the initial angular momentum budget .",
    "therefore , this result effectively rules out the possibility of an energetic gamma - ray burst with formation of intermediate - mass black holes of @xmath37 from super - massive pop iii stars that can be seeds for super - massive black holes in high - redshift quasars ( cf .",

    "a significant reduction in the final radius with no - overshooting is found with 500  @xmath10 but it still does not become a bsg . this strong tendency to become a rsg might be related to the fact that very massive stars are very close to the eddington limit : according to the equation of state , more expansion of a gas is needed to consume a given amount of energy input as the role of radiation pressure becomes more important .",
    "the discrepancy between ( * ? ? ? * in particular the result with their y sequences ) and the others is probably related to the rapid mass accretion throughout the whole evolutionary stages that was assumed in ohkubo et al .. this assumption is , however , subject to many uncertainties .",
    "for example , it is observed that in their m-1 sequence , for which mass accretion was stopped for @xmath79 , the radius rapidly increases to @xmath80 during the post - main sequence phase , unlike the case of the y sequences where rapid mass accretion continues until the end of the evolution .",
    "note that the m-1 sequence in ohkubo et al .",
    "was constructed to consider the radiation feedback from the mass accreting star that can greatly reduce the mass accretion rate as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the feedback effect must become more complicated with rotation .",
    "in particular , mass accretion should result in accretion of angular momentum and the mass - accreting pop iii proto - stars could easily reach the critical rotation when the mass grows beyond a certain limit .",
    "given that mass accretion would be effectively halted once the stellar surface reaches the critical rotation , the ohkubo et al.s assumption of continuous mass accretion that gave the bsg solution is not likely to be valid with rotation .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a separate paper ( h. lee and s .- c .",
    "yoon , in preparation ) .",
    "our conclusion is still subject to modifications with binary interactions .",
    "for example , in a close binary system , the mass accreting star may not be easily rejuvenated but have a relatively small core mass compared to the total mass , if mass accretion occurs near the end of the main sequence or during the post - main sequence phase .",
    "this can often make the star remain blue during the late evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "the evolution of massive binary pop iii stars is thus an interesting topic of future work .",

    "we discussed the possibility of super - collapsars using the evolutionary models of very massive pop iii stars .",
    "we find that pop iii stars with @xmath81 can not be born with enough angular momentum for collapsars in the core .",
    "this is mainly because these very massive stars are very close to the eddington limit for which case the critical rotation velocity at the equatorial surface is severely limited to a value significantly below the keplerian velocity .",
    "the potential progenitors for super - collapsars that can lead to energetic grbs should have the initial mass range of @xmath82 .",
    "we have to consider the evolution of these stars to get a more realistic mass range for super - collapsar progenitors .",
    "high angular momentum and strong magnetic fields of large scales at the pre - collapse stage are the two essential conditions needed for super - collapsars @xcite . given",
    "that magnetic torques can lead to efficient braking of the stellar core , these two conditions may not be easily satisfied simultaneously ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our evolutionary models indeed show that the angular momentum condition can be fulfilled only when we ignore magnetic torques .",
    "if we only consider hydrodynamic processes for the transport of angular momentum like eddington - sweet circulations , the angular momentum conditions for super - collapsars at the final evolutionary stage can be fulfilled for the initial mass range of @xmath83",
    ".    however , these stars become red supergiants at the pre - collapse stage and therefore production of an energetic gamma - ray burst from super - collapsar events seems difficult . if the core can retain enough angular momentum to produce relativistic jets , it may lead to a jet - powered type iip supernova . if the initial rotational velocity is relatively low for the considered mass range , only the outermost layers of the hydrogen envelope may have specific angular momentum above the critical limit for collapsar .",
    "the consequent jet formation would produce an ultra - long ( about a month ) , relatively faint ( @xmath84 ) gamma - ray transient that is marked by a short spike in the gamma - ray luminosity ( @xmath85 ) during the last few seconds , in the rest frame .",
