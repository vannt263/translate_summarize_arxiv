    "the current theoretical picture of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon involves a collapse of a massive , rotating star at the end of its normal evolution , leading to the formation of a black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the standard expanding fireball model of grbs part of the collapsar energy",
    "is channeled into a narrow ultra - relativistic jet with a few degree opening angle and accelerated to lorentz factor @xmath01001000 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the progress in understanding the detailed geometry and energetics of the explosion has been greatly stimulated by the launch of the swift satellite ( @xcite ) in the fall of 2004 .",
    "high precision rapid localizations from the bat instrument ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) combined with new developments in fast optical follow - up and wide field monitoring technology ( @xcite ) have enabled routine observations of the early optical afterglow emission thought to arise in the external shock from the interaction of the jet with the circum - burst medium . in a few bursts it was possible to detect the prompt optical emission from internal shocks within the jet .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of grbs spans several orders of magnitude , and studying the extreme cases provides a handle on the source of this diversity .",
    "the optical transient associated with grb 080319b set a new record of both the apparent magnitude and the intrinsic luminosity . for a few seconds it was detectable with the unaided eye from a dark sky site .",
    "more importantly , new generation optical sky sentinels and rapid response telescopes were able to measure  over an unprecedented range of brightness  the development of the explosion and the afterglow in the minutes before , during , and after the stellar collapse",
    ". sampling the broad - band spectral evolution of grbs and their afterglows with high - cadence , multi - wavelength light curves reaching into the critical first minutes of the explosion is crucial to understanding the emission mechanism . here",
    "we present comprehensive sky monitoring and multi - color optical follow - up observations of grb 080319b collected by the raptor telescope network .",
    "on march 19 , 2008 , at 06:12:49 universal time ( ut ) the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the swift satellite ( @xcite ) was triggered by an intense pulse of gamma rays from grb 080319b ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bat localization distributed over the gamma - ray burst coordinate network ( gcn ) at 06:12:56 ut was received by the raptor telescope network within a second , while the follow - up response for the previous alert ( grb 080319a ) was still in progress . the system owned by the los alamos national laboratory",
    "is located at the fenton hill observatory at an altitude of 2,500 m ( jemez mountains , new mexico ) .",
    "raptor - q is a continuous all sky monitor with the approximate magnitude limit 9.5 ( unfiltered @xmath1-band equivalent , @xmath2 ) .",
    "raptor - p is an array of four 200-mm canon telephoto lenses , each covering a field of view @xmath3 square degrees down to @xmath4 mag , normally used to patrol large areas of the sky for optical flashes .",
    "raptor - t instrument consists of four co - aligned 0.4-m telescopes on a single fast - slewing mount and provides simultaneous images in four photometric bands ( @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 and clear ) . both rapidly slewing telescopes available on the network , raptor - p and t , responded in the override mode upon receiving the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) localization at 06:13:16 ut with the first follow - up exposure starting at 06:13:24 ut ( 35 s after the bat trigger ) .",
    "independently of the follow - up observations , the burst location was covered by our continuous all - sky monitor raptor - q .",
    "those measurements rule out the presence of optical precursor for 30 minutes prior to the gamma - ray burst down to a flux limit of 0.5 jy ( @xmath7 ) or just 2.5% of the peak flux .",
    "unfiltered raptor - q and p magnitudes were calibrated using several hundred stars from the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the color terms and absolute calibration for raptor - t measurements were obtained with 12 dozen stars per filter using secondary field standards from @xcite .",
    "observations were collected in sub - optimal weather with wind - shake affecting about 50% of raptor - t measurements .",
    "the early non - detections in raptor - t data are due to saturation .",
    "photometric measurements after @xmath8 s are based on co - added images utilizing between 5 and 20 individual exposures .",
    "the combined error bars are photon noise estimates with the systematic uncertainty of 0.02 mag added in quadrature .",
    "the light curve resulting from our coordinated measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comb_lc ] , table  [ tab : data ] ) shows the optical flash that within several seconds of the onset reached a peak visual magnitude @xmath9 . at red - shift @xmath10 ( @xcite ) and assuming standard cosmology ( @xmath11 km / s ) this corresponds to absolute magnitude @xmath12 breaking the previous luminosity record held by grb 990123 by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "the simultaneous multi - color measurements recorded by raptor - t starting at @xmath13 s ( figs .",
    "[ fig : colors ] and [ fig : models ] ) reveal an afterglow light curve with a very steep initial decline ( @xmath14 ) , modulated by several small bumps , and followed by a gradual transition to a slower decay after 8001000 s with @xmath15 .",
    "the transition is accompanied by a change in color @xmath16 mag that is largely a result of mixing between two components with colors that are approximately constant .",
    "these trends agree with other published data on grb 080319b from pairitel , kait , nickel , uvot , and gemini - s instruments ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive broad - band study of grb 080319b based on several independent data sets .",
    "all available data sets are consistent within the quoted uncertainties . in our joined model",
    "fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] and table  [ tab : models ] ) we included the data from @xcite in order to constrain the host galaxy reddening and late time decay rate .",
    "we adopted a double power - law model with smc - like extinction ( @xcite ) and spectral index @xmath17 for the red and blue components with decay rates @xmath18 that dominate , correspondingly , early and late times .",
    "there is only a modest amount of dust in the host galaxy reference frame , @xmath19 mag , and the galactic extinction @xmath20 is negligible ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the model with constant intrinsic spectral slopes provides an acceptable fit to the data , the afterglow becomes redder again after @xmath21 s. adding a third power - law results in a degenerate fit , but we can approximately assess the effect of the additional component by adding a time dependent spectral slope @xmath22 with linear dependence on @xmath23 that significantly improves the fit ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "the variations of the optical emission during the burst roughly follow the onset , the three major peaks , and the final decline of the gamma - ray flux ( fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating that both types of radiation have a closely linked source . in the standard fireball model ( @xcite ) , this prompt emission is generated in internal shocks due to colliding shells of material moving at different bulk lorentz factors within the ultra - relativistic outflow . from the burst spectrum measured by konus satellite ( @xcite ) we find the gamma - ray flux density @xmath24 mjy near the peak at 650 kev .",
    "the flux density observed in the optical band in the same time interval is @xmath25 jy and falls four orders of magnitude above the extrapolation of the low - energy gamma - ray spectrum ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the most natural scenario that accommodates the presence of these two distinct spectral components is a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model , in which optical photons are generated as synchrotron emission and gamma rays are a result of inverse - compton scatterings of those photons to higher energies .",
    "both processes operate simultaneously in the power - law distribution of electrons accelerated by the shock front , producing a tracking behavior between the low - energy synchrotron hump and its high - energy `` compton image '' .",
    "the apparent degree of correlation between the gamma - ray and optical light curves can vary widely due to several factors such as the presence of the early afterglow emission , the effective width of the energy distribution of scattering electrons , and the location of the compared frequency ranges within the double peaked ssc spectrum . above the peak frequency , a typical synchrotron spectrum decreases sharply as @xmath27 with @xmath28 , sometimes faster , if the corresponding electrons can not cool effectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observed prompt optical flux and its ratio to gamma - ray flux will be very sensitive to the location of the synchrotron peak , especially if most of the low frequency @xmath29 shoulder is self - absorbed .",
    "the extraordinary brightness of the prompt optical emission in grb 080319b can then be understood as a result of fortuitous positioning of the synchrotron peak in the optical band .",
    "the rise of the prompt optical emission to its peak flux at @xmath30 s is somewhat delayed and extremely steep by comparison with the onset of the gamma - ray emission .",
    "we find @xmath31 with @xmath32 for tortora light curve and @xmath33 observed by bat , so even after scaling by the gamma - ray emission the optical flux rises as @xmath34 prior to the first peak ( fig .",
    "this suggests that at the beginning of the burst @xmath35 , i.e. the optical frequency is below the self - absorption cut - off of the synchrotron radiating fluid . assuming that the emitting shell of shocked material in the relativistic outflow expands and cools adiabatically",
    ", we can estimate the evolution of the electron lorentz factor @xmath36 and magnetic field @xmath37 with constant number of electrons @xmath38 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath39 .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity spectrum resulting from the power - law distribution of electrons @xmath40 will then have a peak flux @xmath41 at @xmath42 , and the self - absorption frequency will decrease with time as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , or @xmath45 otherwise . in this scenario , the optical frequency must be between the peak of emissivity and the self - absorption cut - off ( @xmath46 ) in order for the predicted optical light curve @xmath47 to fit the observations .",
    "other possible arrangements of frequencies result in a much slower flux increase @xmath48 .",
    "the `` unveiling '' of the optical synchrotron peak would occur a few seconds after the corresponding pulse of gamma rays , when the adiabatic expansion of the shocked medium had developed .",
    "the model also predicts a very blue optical spectrum @xmath49 during the fast initial rise , providing a well - defined observational test .",
    "there is a growing evidence that the basic ssc mechanism is important during the prompt phase of most classical long - duration grbs .",
    "optically bright bursts detected during the gamma - ray emission , such as grb 080319b , 990123 and 061126 , tend to have a large `` excess '' of optical light compared to the continuation of the high energy component ( @xcite ) , consistent with the synchrotron peak falling near or slightly below 2 ev . on the other hand , in two well observed bursts showing faint prompt optical emission ( grb 041219b and 050820a ; @xmath50 ) the implied average optical - to - gamma spectrum is flatter than @xmath51 and the optical and gamma - ray light curves are closely correlated ( @xcite ) . without additional information , such as the color of the prompt optical light , it is impossible in this case to rule out a single spectral component peaking between 2 ev and 100 kev .",
    "however , in both objects the high - energy end of the gamma - ray spectrum follows the optical flux more closely than the low - energy part , as expected in the ssc scenario with the optical band well above the synchrotron peak .",
    "the parameters of the early fast - decaying component are marginally consistent with the relation @xmath52 expected for large - angle emission that sets the upper limit on the rate of flux decline due to photons emitted at angles larger than @xmath53 relative to the direction toward the observer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements are harder to reconcile with the reverse shock model ( @xcite ) that predicts a slower decay with @xmath54 for the observed spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the early optical afterglow flux arises from the prompt radiation mechanism and that those optical photons arrive at observer later than the burst simply due to a longer photon path from the curved emitting surface to the observer .",
    "the contrast generated by exceptionally bright prompt optical signal in grb 080319b makes it easier to detect large - angle emission from the burst tail that competes with the slower decaying external shock emission . within the context of the standard fireball model ,",
    "the transition to a shallower decay after 800 s is most likely associated with the emergence of the forward shock driven by the relativistic ejecta into the circum - burst medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , assuming a constant color we obtain values @xmath55 and @xmath22 that do not fit the standard blast wave solutions for the most likely density profiles @xmath56 ( stellar wind ) and @xmath57 ( uniform interstellar medium ) .",
    "it is also difficult to explain the x - ray light curve ( @xcite ) becoming steeper around 3000 s. at very late times ( @xmath58 s ) the model with evolving color approaches the closure relation @xmath59 for a wind medium ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "the data from other instruments point to similar difficulties with the canonical model ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that a consistent interpretation of the xrt light curve and the blue color of the slow - decaying component at early times can be achieved by extending the model with an additional strongly collimated outflow ( two nested jets ) , or introducing a complicated density profile in the external medium ( local clumps ) .",
    "the specific model fit assuming the second scenario presented by @xcite suggests that the cooling break crossed the optical bands ( @xmath60 ) between @xmath61 and 250 s. this would result in a dramatic change of the spectral slope @xmath62 ( @xmath63 mag ) in just 100 s , contradicting the simultaneous color measurements from raptor - t ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] ) .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 color curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] do show some structure in excess of the systematic errors near @xmath66 s , but the reality of this feature is uncertain due to coinciding problems with wind - shake . on the other hand ,",
    "the model fits in table  [ tab : models ] provide a hint that a separate blue component with the temporal profile similar to the x - ray light curve contributes a modest fraction of the total optical flux near @xmath67 s , before the slow decaying forward shock emission starts to dominate .",
    "therefore , the raptor data are consistent with the preferred model of @xcite comprising a narrow jet ( half opening angle @xmath68 ) inside a less collimated outflow ( @xmath69 ) , and generating optical emission from forward shocks at two separate sites .",
    "the unprecedented panchromatic and temporal coverage of grb 080319b revealed complexities in both the burst mechanism and the resulting afterglow that are challenging the standard fireball model .",
    "simultaneous multi - color observations in optical / nir energies during the burst proper are within the reach of the current rapid response telescopes for bright and long - lasting events . with the introduction of even modest spectral capability  such as measuring the sign of the spectral index",
    " the next generation of persistent wide - field sky monitors ( @xcite ) will provide a solid identification of the burst radiation mechanism and probe its possible diversity .",

    "<S> on 19 march 2008 , the northern sky was the stage of a spectacular optical transient that for a few seconds remained visible to the naked eye . </S>",
    "<S> the transient was associated with grb 080319b , a gamma - ray burst at a luminosity distance of about 6 gpc ( standard cosmology ) , making it the most luminous optical object ever recorded by human kind . </S>",
    "<S> we present comprehensive sky monitoring and multi - color optical follow - up observations of grb 080319b collected by the raptor telescope network covering the development of the explosion and the afterglow before , during , and after the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely bright prompt optical emission revealed features that are normally not detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the optical and gamma - ray variability during the explosion are correlated , but the optical flux is much greater than can be reconciled with single emission mechanism and a flat gamma - ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this extreme optical behavior is best understood as synchrotron self - compton model ( ssc ) . after a gradual onset of the gamma - ray emission , there is an abrupt rise of the prompt optical flux suggesting that variable self - absorption dominates the early optical light curve . </S>",
    "<S> our simultaneous multi - color optical light curves following the flash show spectral evolution consistent with a rapidly decaying red component due to large angle emission and the emergence of a blue forward shock component from interaction with the surrounding environment . while providing little support for the reverse shock that dominates the early afterglow , these observations strengthen the case for the universal role of the ssc mechanism in generating gamma - ray bursts . </S>"
