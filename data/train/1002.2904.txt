    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulators form a new state of matter where the gapped bulk state is accompanied by gapless spin edge states that are protected against small perturbations by time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the chiral nature of the quantum hall state , where only one channel propagates at the edge of the system , these new edge states have a helical nature , i.e. there are two counter - propagating spin - edge channels at the edge @xcite .",
    "the topological protection of the edge states is connected with kramer s theorem and states that a system with an odd number of kramer s pairs at a given edge is protected against single - particle excitations @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to find topologically nontrivial insulators is to look at systems where the conduction and the valence bands have opposite parity and a change in band ordering ( band inversion ) occurs as a function of a tuning parameter like the strength of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this criterion leads to the unified dirac form of the effective hamiltonian for topological insulators with a spatial inversion center @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be particularly interested in hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qws ) , which is the first topological insulator discovered in nature@xcite .",
    "this system can be tuned from the normal to 2d topological insulator phase by changing the thickness @xmath3 of the hgte layer @xcite .",
    "recent conductance measurements in multi - terminal structures @xcite clearly show the existence of one - dimensional helical edge channels in this material for @xmath3 larger than the critical value @xmath4 @xcite .    an effective four band model introduced by bernevig , hughes and zhang ( bhz)@xcite consists of two disconnected blocks , each having the form of the dirac hamiltonian in 2d and additional quadratic terms crucial for defining the concept of band inversion .",
    "the bhz model adequately describes the insulating regime in hgte / cdte qws close to the @xmath5 point and the topological quantum phase transition near the critical thickness @xmath6 .",
    "it has been extended to include the bulk inversion symmetry breaking effects in ref .",
    "however , this model does not yet include the structural inversion asymmetry ( sia ) terms that can be very large in this narrow gap material .",
    "indeed , it was shown experimentally that an external top gate applied to the hgte / cdte qws can change the energy of the rashba spin - orbit splitting in the range from 0 to 30mev @xcite and the samples can be tuned from insulating to metallic regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the aharonov - casher oscillations @xcite as well as the ballistic spin - hall effect in hgte / cdte qws @xcite , which occur in the metallic regime , can be well described by an effective two band ( electron or heavy hole ) model taking into account the rashba spin - orbit interactions .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to build an unified hamiltonian for 2d topological insulators that includes information about both the band structure and the presence of an inversion breaking potential .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "using @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 theory we derive an extension of the bhz model describing a 2d topological insulator which includes an out - of - plane ( in z direction ) inversion breaking potential and an in - plane confining potential .",
    "the central result of this paper , the generalized four band hamiltonian , is presented in equation and should also be applicable to other 2d topological insulators , such as type ii inas / gasb quantum wells@xcite and bi@xmath7se@xmath8 thin films @xcite .",
    "next , we will use the foldy - wouthuysen transformation to find an effective model describing electron or heavy hole band .",
    "we show that such an effective model contains two different types of spin - orbit interactions , one of them is the well - known rashba spin - orbit interaction induced by the inversion breaking potential in z - direction , while the other originates from the in - plane confining potential , and is referred to as the in - plane pauli term .",
    "although both of these terms , for the conduction band , are linear in the wave vector and the spin , they contribute differently to the spin transport .",
    "the first ( rashba ) term does not conserve the z - component of spin , @xmath9 , causing spin precession , while the in - plane pauli term conserves @xmath9 .",
    "we study the interplay of the rashba and in - plane pauli terms .",
    "we predict that the spin - hall conductance will show the precession pattern as a function of the inversion breaking potential in z - direction even in the presence of a strong confining potential .",
    "further , the strong in - plane confining potential enhances the spin - hall conductance generated by the rashba term , because it partially fixates the direction of the precessing spin .",
    "therefore the behaviour of the spin transport in asymmetrically doped quantum wells should be dominated by the rashba term and it is justified to describe the spin - hall conductance in the metallic regime through simple effective models for electrons and heavy holes ( see equations and of this manuscript ) , as long as the band gap is non - zero .    the rest of the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2.1 gives the derivation of the effective four band model for a 2d topological insulator with a spatial inversion breaking potential using @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 theory . in section 2.2",
    "we show that the same hamiltonian can be derived using general symmetry arguments .",
    "in section 3 we derive an effective one band model with competing rashba - type and in - plane pauli contributions .",
    "section 4 describes the interplay between both terms within the landauer - bttiker formalism .",
    "we finish the paper with conclusions .",
    "in this section we will consider the influence of the structural inversion asymmetry on hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qws ) and derive a corresponding effective @xmath10 model with an out - of plane ( in z - direction ) inversion breaking potential .",
    "our starting point is the eight - band kane hamiltonian @xmath11 , which is described in @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit split - off bands @xmath12 are far away in energy from the other bands and are not important for the description of the quantum well .",
    "this is in contrast to the bulk case , where sia terms are nonzero only when the @xmath13 band is taken into account @xcite .",
    "therefore we limit ourself to the upper @xmath14 block of the kane model with the basis set of wave functions in the sequence @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where we use the standard notation with @xmath19 describing s - like conduction band , @xmath20 p - like light hole band and @xmath21 p - like heavy hole band in zincblende crystal structures@xcite .    in the following we always use @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) to denote the basis set of wave functions shortly .",
    "we consider a quantum well configuration with hgte layers sandwiched by two cdte barrier layers along z direction , hence the parameters of the kane model @xmath11 have spatial dependence @xcite .",
    "the matching of wave functions in z - direction for hgte / cdte qws has to be done very carefully because the bulk barrier material cdte has a normal band structure with @xmath19 above @xmath24 bands while bulk hgte has inverted band ordering with @xmath24 above @xmath19 bands @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the reason for the change from the normal to inverted band structure ordering for the hgte / cdte qws above the critical value of hgte layer width @xmath25 nm ( see for example fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the envelope function approximation @xcite is applied to solve the eigenproblem of the quantum well . since the kane model preserves inversion symmetry , in order to discuss the sia , we need to take into account an additional potential @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the elementary charge and @xmath28 is the inversion breaking potential in z - direction , while @xmath29 is the in - plane confining potential and its form will be specified in section 4 . then the full hamiltonian is @xmath30 next we split the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamfull ] ) into two parts @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the kane hamiltonian when @xmath33 and is treated as the zero - order hamiltonian .",
    "explicitly , @xmath32 is given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is an operator and the heavy hole bands ( @xmath36 ) are completely decoupled from the electron and light hole bands . here @xmath37 is the kane matrix element between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands , while the other parameters are given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 including remote bands @xmath42 with @xmath43 symmetry perturbatively .",
    "@xmath44 designate the positions of the conduction / valence band edges and the @xmath45 are renormalized luttinger parameters @xcite . the axial approximation is adopted @xcite in order to keep the in - plane rotation symmetry .",
    "@xmath46 is treated as a perturbation , and is written as @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 , @xmath51\\right)$ ] , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . here , @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the renormalized luttinger parameter related to the part of hamiltonian which is antisymmetric in the components of @xmath0 . in the original luttinger model , it was introduced because in the presence of a magnetic field the components of @xmath0 do not commute . in our case",
    ", it appears because the material parameters are functions of the @xmath56 coordinate .",
    "now we will generalize the bhz approach @xcite to project the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamfull ] ) into the low energy sub - space , which can be done in two steps .",
    "first , we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 , to obtain the eigenenergies @xmath59 and eigenstates @xmath60 of the quantum well . here",
    "the eigenstate @xmath60 can be expanded in the basis @xmath61 as @xmath62 , where the function @xmath63 gives the envelope function along z - direction for the quantum well .",
    "we use greek indices to indicate basis functions of the kane hamiltonian and roman indices to denote the subbands .",
    "the envelope function components @xmath64 are calculated with the help of the numerical diagonalization of @xmath57 .    in order to perform the degenerate perturbation calculation , we need to cast the eigenstates of @xmath57 into two classes .",
    "the first one , denoted as class a , includes the basis wave functions of our final four band effective model . as shown by bhz @xcite , for hgte / cdte quantum wells ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the two electron - like subbands @xmath65 and two heavy hole subbands @xmath66 , which are expanded explicitly as latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the position , momentum and spin - operators in the heisenberg representation ( see nikoli et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath219 is a unit vector . in this simple picture",
    "the force acting on electrons due to so coupling is quadratic in @xmath179 , explaining the behaviour of @xmath220 as a function of the out of plane electric field for low @xmath119 .",
    "the force described in deflects the spin-@xmath221 and the spin-@xmath222 electrons in opposite transverse directions leading to the spin - hall effect .",
    "however , the hamiltonian does not conserve the z - component of the spin , leading to a rotation of the spin direction and as a consequence to oscillations in @xmath220 as a function of @xmath179 . the first maximum of the spin - hall conductance is reached , when the spin has travelled a distance equivalent to the spin precession length @xcite @xmath223 , over which the expectation value @xmath224 rotates by @xmath225 .",
    "the electric field @xmath226 corresponding to the precession length is indicated as a red line in figure [ figurebothsquare]b and is in good agreement with the maximum of the absolute value of @xmath220 . + * in - plane pauli interaction * : the spin - hall conductance shows a linear behaviour as a function of the in - plane electric field ( see blue circles in figure [ figurebothsquare]a , where only the @xmath227 components are nonzero ) . this linear dependence on field strength",
    "can be explained within the semiclassical approach , where we have adopted the wave packet dynamics by sundaram and niu @xcite to obtain equations of motion for the in - plane pauli term : @xmath228 with the magnetic field set to zero . here",
    "the index @xmath229 denotes the center coordinate of the wave packet in position and @xmath230 space .",
    "the berry curvature is defined as @xmath231 where symbol",
    "@xmath232 corresponds to two eigenvalues @xmath233 of the upper spin block of the hamiltonian @xmath234 in with @xmath235 being corresponding eigenstates for spin @xmath158 .",
    "simply describes the change of the lattice momentum due to the electric field . describes the time evolution of the position operator due to the band dispersion and the anomalous velocity term @xmath236 with the spin - dependent non - zero z - components @xmath237 .",
    "the spin - dependent anomalous velocity term shifts the position of the wave packet with different spins in two opposite transverse directions leading to the spin - hall effect . inserting into yields the dependence of the anomalous velocity term linear in @xmath118 . note , that the energy range ( @xmath238 ) plotted in figures [ figurebothsquare]a and b is the same for both interaction terms . since the coupling parameters can be quite different ( in our calculations @xmath239 ) , the magnitudes of in - plane and out - of - plane electric fields are adjusted so the interaction energies are the same . + * interplay of both interactions * : a linear superposition of , and @xmath185 leads to the spin signal which is shown in figures [ figurebothsquare]a and b , when all three field components are nonzero .",
    "the finite value of the spin - hall conductance in figure [ figurebothsquare]a for @xmath240 is due to the rashba coupling .",
    "it can be observed , that the linear behaviour of the in - plane pauli term with the electric field is not changed , when rashba spin - orbit coupling is present .",
    "however , the slope of the spin - hall conductance curves decreases with @xmath241 , which means that the in - plane pauli contribution to the spin signal is suppressed by the rashba interaction . the z - component of the spin is not conserved for finite @xmath119 , as can be seen from equation .",
    "the resulting spin precession implies that generation of a spin current by the anomalous velocity becomes less effective . the smallest slope and therefore smallest in - plane pauli contribution in figure [ figurebothsquare]a is found for an electric field @xmath119 corresponding to the precession length , where an expectation value @xmath224 rotates by @xmath225 .",
    "figure [ figurebothsquare]b shows @xmath220 as a function of @xmath119 for different in - plane electric fields .",
    "one can see the typical precession pattern of @xmath213 also for @xmath242 .",
    "moreover the precession amplitude of the spin - hall conductance of the rashba type is enhanced in the presence of the in - plane pauli term .",
    "the origin of this increase can be traced back to the @xmath230-dependent energy splitting of the spin subbands due to the in - plane pauli interaction . in order to lower its energy",
    "the electron now prefers to stay in either spin up or down states .",
    "the precession of the spin is thus slightly suppressed , as can be seen in a small shift of the minima to higher electric fields . as discussed above",
    ", the spin force operator can act more efficiently on electrons with a preferred spin @xmath56-projection , which leads to the relatively higher magnitude of the spin - hall conductance caused by rashba coupling .",
    "+ c and d also show @xmath243 and @xmath213 respectively but now with included potential @xmath29 and darwin @xmath244 terms .",
    "in the tight binding approach , both terms renormalize the diagonal on - site energy .",
    "they can not generally be considered to be small , as they scale , like the in - plane pauli term , with the magnitude and the shape of the confining electric field .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the in - plane pauli , darwin and potential terms depend on the choice of the functional dependence @xmath29 .",
    "the most important scale is the characteristic length scale @xmath141 , over which the corresponding field drops to @xmath245 .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations with different values @xmath246 and @xmath141 and found , that the main features of the results discussed in this paper stay the same . for the configuration",
    "we choose the main renormalization in respect to figures a and b is due to the darwin term .",
    "+ the divergence of @xmath128 appears as an additional term in the semiclassical equation and therefore the spin - independent darwin term can contribute to the anomalous velocity and renormalize the spin - hall conductance term .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ figurebothsquare]c as a non linear behaviour of @xmath247 . however , in the range of in - plane electric fields shown in figures 3c and 3d , the qualitative behaviour of the spin - hall conductance is the same as in the absence of the darwin term ( see a , b )",
    ". increasing the in - plane electric field to the same magnitude as the electric field perpendicular to the 2deg bears two difficulties .",
    "first of all the interaction energy of the in - plane pauli term exceeds the fermi energy which marks the limit of validity of our effective electron model .",
    "secondly increasing @xmath134 comes along with a raising tunneling barrier in the quadratic sample .",
    "we can omit these difficulties by choosing the sample in a shape of a cross ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the cross sample is constructed of 5 square parts : 4 stubs and the central square ( see figure [ figuresample]b ) .",
    "each part has the width @xmath248 and is discretized by @xmath249 lattice sites .",
    "the corresponding spin - hall conductance originating from in - plane pauli and rashba terms in the presence of the darwin term and the confining potential is shown in figures [ figurecrossstructure]a - d. +    figures [ figurecrossstructure]a , b show @xmath250 and @xmath251 for different values of fields in z and in - plane directions correspondingly and for the characteristic range of the electric field @xmath252 nm . these figures should be compared with figures [ figurebothsquare]c and [ figurebothsquare]d correspondingly .",
    "the overall behaviour of spin - hall conductance in figures [ figurecrossstructure]a and b is similar to the quadratic sample .",
    "however , although we used values of in - plane electric field around twenty times larger than in figure [ figurebothsquare]d the influence of @xmath134 on @xmath251 is much weaker than for the square structure ( compare [ figurecrossstructure]b with [ figurebothsquare]d ) .",
    "probability of scattering from vertical and horizontal walls in the cross structure is much smaller than in a case of square structure where electron directly hits the wall .",
    "therefore we find that the influence of in - plane electric field will be much weaker in the experimentally relevant cross samples .    in order to obtain a contribution to @xmath220 due to the confining potential comparable to that for the quadratic sample ,",
    "we have increased @xmath141 from @xmath253 nm to @xmath254 nm , in figures [ figurecrossstructure]c , d .",
    "this leads to a larger range of lattice sites , which can contribute efficiently to the spin dependent hopping . in the case of the larger @xmath141",
    "the results resemble those discussed in the last section for square samples . in figure",
    "[ figurecrossstructure]d the amplitude of the rashba contribution to the spin - hall effect counted to the first minimum is enhanced by the confinement potential . by contrast",
    "the signal due to the in - plane pauli term decreases until @xmath119 corresponds to the first minimum as can be seen in figure [ figurecrossstructure]c .",
    "the magnitude of the slope increases slightly for higher values of the top gate field , but with an inverted sign with respect to the quadratic sample ( see figure [ figurebothsquare]c ) . + at the end of this section let us emphasize , that for the experimentally relevant case both interactions are present , but only @xmath119 can be easily varied , e.g. by a top gate . therefore , in the experimentally relevant case , the presence of both the in - plane pauli and the darwin interactions could lead to an increase of the amplitude of spin signal .",
    "we have derived an extension to the bhz hamiltonian for the typical 2d topological insulator ( hgte qws ) in the presence of the inversion breaking potential in z - direction and in - plane confining potential . for the derivation , we used two independent methods : @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 perturbation theory and symmetry arguments based on clifford algebra .",
    "we found that to the third order in the perturbation theory , only the inversion breaking potential in z - direction generates new off - diagonal in spin space terms .",
    "these terms lead to the rashba spin - orbit interaction when the foldy - wouthuysen transformation to the effective electron model is performed . on the other hand",
    "the diagonal - in - spin space part of the hamiltonian in the presence of the confining in - plane potential generates an additional term to the one band model which is also linear in momentum and spin , but conserves the z - component of the spin . by analogy with the equation for a relativistic electron in vacuum",
    "we call this term in - plane pauli term",
    ". the presence of both terms in the conduction band hamiltonian leads to an interesting behaviour of the spin - hall conductance .",
    "in particular , the in - plane pauli contribution to the spin - hall conductance is suppressed in the presence of the spin precession inducing terms . by contrast",
    ", the spin - hall conductance from the rashba term preserves the oscillation pattern in the presence of the in - plane pauli term and its magnitude can be enhanced due to partial pinning of the z - component of the spin .",
    "this latter situation is experimentally relevant since the inversion breaking potential in z - direction can be easily tuned by a top gate in experiments .",
    "therefore we expect that in experiments on asymmetrically doped hgte / cdte qws @xcite in the metallic regime ( the fermi level in the conduction or valence band ) , the behaviour of spin transport and especially the spin - hall conductance will be dominated by the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "note , that in our derivation we omit the bia terms since they are already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us also emphasize that our effective four band hamiltonian in the presence of inversion breaking potential is not limited only to the hgte / cdte qws and can be easily generalized to other topological insulators like type ii inas / gasb / alsb quantum wells@xcite or bi@xmath7se@xmath8 thin film@xcite with correctly adjusted strengths of the rashba spin - orbit interactions .",
