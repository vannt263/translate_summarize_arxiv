    "the effect is qualitatively interpreted in @xcite in terms of charges flowing away from the quantum well during a positive gate polarization . beyond this , no attempt of microscopic and electrostatic analysis has been proposed so far and no method to switch the system back from the metastable to the pristine state has been found .    in this paper ,",

    "[ fig7]a for sample c. the sample was first cooled to 20k ( black r(t ) curve ) .",

    "a slow resistance decrease was obtained , as shown in the inset . at the end of such procedure",
    ", the samples indeed recovered the pristine properties , as shown by the red r(t ) curve .",
    "the same procedure successfully applied to all samples , although a much longer time ( above 10 h ) was needed to reset sample * a * and sample * b * , as shown in @xcite .    on the base of the above - described model of the oxide interface retention state",
    ", we assume that the positive voltage , coupled to the room temperature thermal energy , induces a slow creep of trapped charges from the fg states into the control gate , across the whole thickness of the substrate .",
    "this procedure is reminiscent of the reset procedure of current electrically erasable programmable read - only memories ( e@xmath24prom ) devices , also based on fg mosfet technology . at difference to our samples , characterized by a macroscopically thick control gate barrier , e@xmath24proms can be reset instantaneously by a control gate polarization cycle , thanks to their ultra - thin oxide gate layer .",
    "an instantaneous resetting method for our samples was finally mutuated from previous fg eprom technology(fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) . for eproms , which did not allow for an instantaneous electrical reset , uv light was used to bring the device out of the metastable retention state and back to the pristine state .",
    "the high energy of uv photons was necessary for the electrons in the fg to exceed the oxide barrier energy , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . due to the small energy barriers confining our trapped electrons in their localized states , as suggested by our sketch reported in fig .",
    "[ fig8]b , visible red light ( 625 nm ) was employed in our experiment at @xmath23 .",
    "the sample was first switched to the highly resistive state by a positive polarization pulse and then switched back by a total photon dose of about @xmath25 photons / cm@xmath24 delivered by a led source in about 3 - 5 seconds ( fig . [ fig8]b ) .",
    "this colossal and unprecedented , light - induced insulator - to - metal transition results in a sudden switch with a resistive ratio @xmath1 at 20k .",

    "after illumination , a r(t ) curve was taken during warm - up .",
    "the sample reproduced the curve of the pristine samples , except for two minor features : a photoconductivity effect in the first part of the warm - up curve , and a typical feature at about 200 k , often seen in lao / sto warm - up plots @xcite .",
    "the reported data and their interpretation in terms of band diagrams pose strong limits to our capability to truly probe the enriched portion of the lao / sto phase diagrams by a back - gate bias .",
    "data collected on three different samples show that the sheet conductance in the nominal  carrier - enriched \" state is equal ( sample * c * ) or smaller ( samples * a * , * b * ) than in the pristine state , for all cycles of our bg square waveform , except for the first . even during the first cycle ,",
    "i.e. soon after the fpp , the sheet conductivity exceeds the pristine one by no more that 10% ( sample * a * ) or by much less ( samples * b * and * c * ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that the available , empty , confined 2deg states , marked in gray in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , are very few in pristine samples with respect to the occupied ones . as shown in @xcite and discussed in appendix a , such states should not exist at all in an  ideal \" system where no localized states are present .",
    "the presence of a space charge accumulated in the las will allow instead for a non - null second derivative of the potential profile , thus effectively increasing the quantum well edge @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "the space charge in the las , induced during the fpp , plays therefore an essential role in making the 2deg tunable in enrichment mode during the following cycles .",
    "these considerations also suggest that a limited occupancy of the las might be present also in pristine samples and play a role , by inducing the formation of a weak space charge , in determining the actual lao / sto band diagram and thus in confining the 2deg .",
    "our data support a scenario in which shallow localized acceptor states are present in proximity of the 2deg , as theoretically suggested in @xcite , and in which a dynamical exchange of carriers between the mobile and trapped states controllably takes place under field effect and light .",
    "any experiment trying to identify the chemical origin of the trap states would go beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our present data only allow to state that the trap states lie in the @xmath28 gap and that their depth is in - between several times room temperature kt values ( i.e. about 0.1 ev ) and our red light photon energy ( i.e. 2 ev ) .",
    "interestingly , the presence of trap states with energy lying about 0.3 ev below the sto conduction band has been demonstrated in sto single crystals by optical spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the origin of such trap states might be possibly related to the presence of cation vacancies , or of interstitial hydrogen@xcite .",
    "we have investigated the low - temperature transport properties of back - gated 2degs at oxide interfaces .",
    "our batch of analyzed samples included metallic amorphous - lgo / sto interfaces , a system for which the formation of an interfacial 2deg was never proved before .",
    "we show that our samples can be brought by a positive polarization pulse into a persistent insulating state .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is analyzed as a function of the initial carrier density . in low - carrier - density samples , a non - volatile four - order - of - magnitude resistive switching to the insulating state",
    "is obtained .",
    "this work introduces a new element of complexity to our understanding of lao / sto - like interfaces , addressing them as systems in which two distinct electron reservoirs , mobile carriers and localized charges , interact electrostatically , while dynamically exchanging electrons under external perturbations .",
    "we provided evidence that the colossal resistive switching taking place under field effect can be understood in terms of the formation of a retention state that mimics the analogous state of floating - gate mosfet devices . by suggesting the use of light as a resetting technique ,",
    "this analogy finally lead us to the fabrication of a non - volatile 3-terminal device prototype , where a 4-order - of - magnitude resistance switch can be induced by a voltage pulse and erased by a pulse of light .",
    "the behavior of the three different samples in each of the successive voltage steps can be properly described by a simple electrostatic model , which partially neglects the quantum effects of the backgating potential on the confining qw ( as shown by scopigno et al .",
    "@xcite ) but still provides a clear and reliable understanding of the physical system , consistent with the results already found by biscaras et al . @xcite .",
    "the model is based on few reasonable and straightforward assumptions :    1 .   in agreement with the qualitative analysis reported above",
    ", the charge - neutrality conditions for our samples should be written as @xmath15= -@xmath29=@xmath12+@xmath5=@xmath12+@xmath3 .",
    "such equation implies , in particular , that in case all localized acceptor states were empty , all the bound states in the quantum well would be occupied , realizing the condition @xmath12=@xmath15=-@xmath29 . in case a nonzero + @xmath3 density due the occupation of the localized states is present , an equivalent amount of empty bound states @xmath5=@xmath3 , is also present at the interface .",
    "no field - effect - induced @xmath30 doping of the interface is possible .",
    "therefore the scds @xmath12 and @xmath3 can never become positive .",
    "as already first observed by @xcite , the fpp effect , i.e. the loss of carriers from the qw carriers taking place for a high enough positive @xmath4 is an irreversible process at the low temperatures ( 20k ) of our experiment .",
    "reformulated in the language of this paper , this means that the system is unable to transfer charge back from @xmath3 to @xmath12 , even when backgate - induced changes of the potential profile would make this situation energetically more favorable ; an exception to the former assumption takes place , nevertheless , if the system , during a backgate voltage step , has no way to satisfy charge neutrality conditions by keeping @xmath3 constant . in this case",
    "only , due to the large electrostatic monopole energy involved , carriers will be detrapped .",
    "@xmath3 will be consequently decreased to such a level that allows the sample neutrality condition to be satisfied .",
    "this assumption will be crucial in understanding the response of sample c , as shown in the following ; 4 .",
    "the parallel - plate capacitor model , used to describe the variations of scd , breaks down when the 2deg is completely depleted .",
    "in such a case , in fact , no potential can be defined on the upper face of the sto substrate .",
    "the system  misses one plate \" and can simply not be modeled anymore as a capacitor . during any attempt to push the sample in further depletion by an extra negative voltage ,",
    "the sample reacts to the negative pulse as an open circuit , and remains basically unperturbed , with no further charge transfer taking place .    in order to describe the different scds of our different samples ( * a",
    "* , * b * , * c * ) in the relevant quarter - cycles ( 1 , ... , 6 ) we will adopt a couple of indexes .",
    "we start by writing the charge neutrality conditions of the overall system ( including donor states , interface , las and back - gate ) that , for a generic sample x = a , b or c , in each of the four quarter - cycles of the @xmath7 period , read : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34      the sample is initially in a pristine state , which depends both on the deposition conditions and , possibly , on previous interaction with the environment ( e.g. , exposure to light ) .",

    "the numerical considerations reported below should not be intended as a claim of real quantitive estimation of the carrier densities of the different samples during the cycle .",
    "still , they clearly allow to capture the phenomenological response of the three samples to the successive phases of the voltage cycle .",

    "<S> the field - effect - induced modulation of transport properties of 2-dimensional electron gases residing at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 and lagao@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces has been investigated in a back - gate configuration . both samples with crystalline and with amorphous overlayers </S>",
    "<S> have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the  nave \" standard scenario , in which the back electrode and the 2-dimensional electron gas are simply modeled as capacitor plates , dramatically fails in describing the observed phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> anomalies appearing after the first low - temperature application of a positive gate bias , and causing a non - volatile perturbation of sample properties , are observed in all our samples . </S>",
    "<S> such anomalies are shown to drive low - carrier density samples to a persistent insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> recovery of the pristine metallic state can be either obtained by a long room - temperature field annealing , or , instantaneously , by a relatively modest dose of visible - range photons . </S>",
    "<S> illumination causes a sudden collapse of the electron system back to the metallic ground state , with a resistivity drop exceeding four orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the data are discussed and interpreted on the base of the analogy with floating - gate mosfet devices , which sheds a new light on the effects of back - gating on oxide - based 2-dimensional electron gases . </S>",
    "<S> a more formal approach , allowing for a semi - quantitative estimate of the relevant surface carrier densities for different samples and under different back - gate voltages , is proposed in the appendix . </S>"
