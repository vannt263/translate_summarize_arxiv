    "<S> this final state is invariant under spin flip if the two opposite spin excitations now present in each wire compensate . in wire  1 , the spin hole must be compensated by the spin - down excitation from the injection . because it is created at the position of the _ charge _ </S>",

    "<S> the spin - down excitation produced by tunneling needs to coincide with the spin - up excitation created at injection , so the process is strong if @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> following the same reasoning , the competing process @xmath85 is strongest if @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> unless @xmath77 these conditions can not be fulfilled simultaneously , so the two processes do not cancel and the exchange current becomes nonzero [ fig .  [ fig - interpretation](b ) ] . </S>",

    "<S> spin and charge excitations are drawn with different height for better visibility . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) for suitable injection points @xmath84 the new spin excitations compensate the one already present in each wire , leading to a strong exchange process . </S>",
    "<S> the competing process can not have spin compensation at the same time and is weak . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry caused by spin - charge separation gives rise to a finite exchange current . ]    </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the final state @xmath89 is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is summed over all possible tunnel times ( including the spin - induced events to allow for interference effects ) . </S>",

    "<S> _ biased injection._ time controlled pointlike pair injection into qh edge states has recently been demonstrated with charge pumps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a cps operated at a constant voltage , on the other hand , can be modeled by a pair - tunneling hamiltonian which takes into account a voltage induced phase difference @xcite instead of the initial state approach . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage gives rise to a length scale @xmath98 . at large bias , @xmath99 , </S>",
    "<S> the injection becomes as pointlike as allowed by the bandwidth and we recover the results of the initial state approach . at low voltages </S>",
    "<S> , it follows from standard renormalization group arguments that physical quantities like the current depend on the ratio of @xmath100 and the length scale set by the voltage ( supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the exchange currents at two voltages @xmath2 , @xmath101 are related through @xmath102 this means that in order to access the @xmath100 dependency illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - initial ] experimentally , it is not necessary to actually move the injection points . </S>",
    "<S> rather , varying voltages can be applied to a fixed geometry sample ( cf .  </S>",

    "<S> m / s , the injection distances become @xmath112  nm and @xmath113  nm .    the primary challenge when designing an entanglement detection scheme which is not based on the violation of a bell - type inequality is to isolate the exchange contribution from the background given by the direct contributions and measurement noise . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for the exchange current , which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the background . when changing the phase angle @xmath34 linearly , the exchange contribution oscillates and can be isolated easily via lock - in amplification from the direct signal , which remains unaffected , cf .  </S>",

    "<S> all other parameters can then remain fixed . </S>",
    "<S> one way to influence @xmath34 is given by the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite present in nanowires : when applying a transversal electric field @xmath114 ( illustrated by the gray back gates in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - setup ] ) , spin - up and spin - down electrons acquire different fermi vectors @xmath115 @xcite where @xmath116 is tunable via back gates @xcite . in this way , until reaching the tunnel junction a relative phase @xmath117 is collected . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on inas wires show that the rashba length @xmath118 can become as short as 150  nm @xcite which allows for several oscillation periods at the beam splitter size as estimated above . </S>",
    "<S> when ramping the electric field @xmath114 up and down in a triangular fashion , the exchange current oscillates continuously . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement can thus be detected without any magnetic element or correlation measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we have demonstrated how , due to spin - charge separation , the hallmark of tlls , spin entanglement affects the average charge current in an electronic beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism can be fully understood in terms of collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to traditional entanglement detection schemes based on spin filters and correlation measurements , which have proven to be notoriously difficult to implement , this effect allows for a promising new approach .    </S>",
