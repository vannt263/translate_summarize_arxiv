    "heavy - ion collisions induced by radioactive beam at intermediate energies play a significant role to extract the information of nuclear equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter under extreme conditions , such as high density , high temperature and large isospin asymmetry etc . besides nucleonic observables such as rapidity distribution and flow of free nucleons or light clusters ( such as deuteron , triton and alpha etc . ) , also mesons emitted from the reaction zone can be probes of the hot and dense nuclear matter . the energy per nucleon in the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter",

    "the ratio increases with the stiffness of the symmetry energy , but decreases for the case of the superhard symmetry energy .",
    "the phenomena can be explained from the fact that although the symmetry energy reduces the n / z ratio in the high - density region .",
    "a hard symmetry energy repulses neutrons of the colliding partners to flow the high - density region and enhances the domain of the supra - saturation density .",
    "therefore , the neutron - neutron collisions in the case of the hard symmetry energy take place in a larger region at supra - saturation densities than a soft one .",

    "the dynamics of the pion production in heavy - ion collisions in the region of 1a gev energies is investigated systematically by using the imiqmd model .",
    "the calculated total pions are consistent with the different skyrme parameters skp , sly6 , ska , siii which correspond to the different modulus of incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter , and the available experimental data are reproduced rather well .",
    "the excitation functions of the @xmath0 ratio are sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy .",
    "the difference is pronounced at near threshold energies and for neutron - rich systems .",
    "calculations show that the ratio does not monotonically depend on the stiffness of the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities .",
    "the influence of the in - medium pion dispersion relation on the distributions of transverse momentum and longitudinal rapidity is pronounced .",
    "but it has a minor contribution on the excitation functions of the total pion production and the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "calculations of the structure of the directed and elliptic flows are similar to the available experimental data .",
    "the flow distributions are sensitive to the coulomb potential in the mean field , but weakly depend on the different cases of the symmetry energies .",
    "polar angle anisotropies are pronounced in the peripheral collisions and the influence of the stiffness of the symmetry energy on the polar angle distribution is weak .",
