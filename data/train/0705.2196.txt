    "post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars are short - lived objects ( typically 10@xmath1 years ) , of initial mass between 0.8  8 m@xmath2 . they have evolved from the agb , undergone severe mass loss , and will become planetary nebulae @xcite . this evolutionary stage has been reviewed by , for example , @xcite and @xcite , and is important as it provides an insight into the nucleosynthesis and mixing processes during the later stages of stellar evolution .",
    "most post - agb stars have been identified via their infrared excess , arising from a circumstellar dust shell .",
    "this shell is most readily detected at the earliest stages of post - agb evolution , when it is relatively hot and close to the star . as a result",
    ", the majority of post - agbs found to date have just left the agb , and are of a , f or g spectral type @xcite .",
    "a number of abundance studies have been performed for post - agb stars , with the majority being metal - poor @xcite . however , there are many features of post - agb evolution which are not yet fully understood . for example , several stars show abundance patterns reminiscent of interstellar gas , with si , ca etc following the very low fe abundance , while cno and s are near solar @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism for the formation of such a ` cleaned - up ' photosphere in a post - agb star , where grain formation occurs in the circumstellar shell produced in the agb phase of the star , and subsequent slow accretion of the gas from this material results in the peculiar abundance pattern .",
    "this is most likely to happen during mass transfer between the components of a binary system , or accretion triggered by a binary companion .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that all the extremely fe deficient post - agb stars known at that time are binaries , providing support for this hypothesis .",
    "although most of the known post - agbs are cool objects , several b - type stars originally classified as being populationi are now believed to be hot post - agbs , on the basis of their derived atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . however , although the b - type stars should be evolving from the cooler post - agbs , there are significant differences .",
    "the most striking is the large c underabundance found for several hot objects , which may imply that these left the agb before the third dredge - up @xcite .",
    "these apparent abundance differences between the hot and cool post - agb candidates indicate that further investigations are required , so that this evolutionary stage may be more fully understood . as a first step , it is clearly important to study hot post - agb objects of known initial metallicity , rather than field stars of unknown origin .",
    "fortunately , a sample of these is available : the well - known uv - bright stars found in some globular clusters , whose post - agb nature has been unambiguously established from their position in the cluster colour - magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "a review of uv - bright stars in globular clusters can be found in @xcite , while searches for globular cluster post - agb stars include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . of the b - type post - agb stars studied to date ,",
    "only three have well determined iron abundance estimates , namely zng-1 in m10 @xcite , barnard29 in m13 and roa5701 in @xmath0cen @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined optical spectra of zng-1 , finding an iron abundance larger than the metallicity of the cluster , m10 . barnard29 and roa5701 have been studied several times , primarily due to their relative brightness , using both optical and ultraviolet spectra ( see , for example , ) .",
    "however the iron abundances have previously been estimated using only the uv spectra .",
    "in particular , @xcite have analysed hst observations of these stars and derived fe abundances which are lower than the cluster metallicities , which they explained by the grain formation process discussed above . if barnard29 and roa5701 have such ` cleaned - up ' photospheres , then one would expect them to show similar depletions in mg and si , which are also subject to grain formation .",
    "however , previous studies of barnard29 and roa5701 indicate no depletions in mg nor si .    clearly , the abundances of barnard29 and roa5701 need revisiting , in particular those for fe . in this paper , high resolution",
    "optical and ultraviolet spectra of barnard29 and roa5701 are analysed , using model atmosphere techniques to estimate atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions .",
    "the observations and data reduction are discussed in section 2 , while section 3 details the analysis methods and results . in section 4",
    "we present a discussion of our results , and in particular we assess the accuracy of fe abundance determinations for b - type stars using ultraviolet spectra .",
    "optical spectra of barnard29 and roa5701 were obtained during two observing runs , the former with the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope ( mcdonald observatory ) on three nights between 2005 april 30 and may 5 , and the latter with the mpg / eso 2.2-m telescope ( la silla , chile ) on 2006 april 10 .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of both stars were taken from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archive .",
    "details of the observations are provided below .",
    "barnard 29 was observed with the 2d - coud spectrograph @xcite , using a 2.4 arcsec slit to achieve a spectral resolution ( @xmath3=@xmath4/@xmath5 ) of @xmath635000 and a wavelength coverage of @xmath6370010000  .",
    "due to cloud , data were taken only on three nights , resulting in 30 half hour exposures , or 15 hours on - source .",
    "a th - ar hollow cathode lamp was observed at the beginning and end of each night , with the centres of the lines stable to better than @xmath60.1 pixel .",
    "test exposures were taken at the start of the run , to ensure that optical ghosts ( ` the picket fence ' ; @xcite ) and bad columns did not overlap with wavelength regions of interest , in particular the feiii lines around 4420  .",
    "also , in order to ensure that the weak absorption line features detected were real , the central wavelength was changed , by @xmath60.4  , after the first night and remained in the new position for the other two clear nights .",
    "the data were reduced using standard methods within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ; @xcite ) .",
    "this reduction included bias subtraction and flatfielding , with stellar extraction and cosmic  ray removal performed using doecslit @xcite and scombine .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel in the co - added spectrum was @xmath6130 per pixel at @xmath64420 (corresponding to @xmath6180 per resolution element ) , and this was read into the starlink package dipso @xcite for further analysis ( see section [ sec_dip ] ) .",
    "the optical spectra of roa5701 were obtained using the high - resolution fibre - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ; @xcite ) , with the ev 2k@xmath74k ccd detector and a 79 lines mm@xmath8 chelle grating . in total , roa5701 was observed for 9 hours , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath3 @xmath646000 and a wavelength coverage of @xmath635609200  .",
    "the data were reduced on - line , using the standard feros data reduction system ( drs ) , implemented with eso  midas software .",
    "this reduction includes the extraction and de - blazing of the chelle orders , wavelength calibration and merging of the orders .",
    "the reduced spectral exposures were combined into a single spectrum using scombine within iraf , and this was imported into dipso for further analysis ( see section [ sec_dip ] ) .",
    "an average s / n ratio of @xmath685 per pixel at @xmath64420   was obtained , corresponding to @xmath6120 per resolution element .",
    "initially , the continua of the optical spectra for both barnard29 and roa5701 were normalised using low - order polynomials fitted to spectral regions free from absorption features .",
    "the line fitting program elf within dipso was then employed to measure absorption line equivalent widths , by fitting gaussian profiles to the lines ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "balmer lines and diffuse hei line equivalent widths were not measured , as instead theoretical profiles were fitted to the normalized data ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig_hga ] ) .     at 4341   in the spectra of barnard29 ( upper panel ) and roa5701 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the theoretical profiles have been generated for surface gravities of 2.75 , 3.0 and 3.25 dex ( upper , middle and lower smooth curves , respectively ) for barnard29 , implying a surface gravity of 2.95 dex .",
    "for roa5701 , results have been calculated for surface gravities of 3.0 , 3.25 and 3.5 dex ( upper , middle and lower smooth curves , respectively ) , implying log  _ g _ = 3.3 dex.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the ultraviolet spectra of barnard29 and roa5701 were obtained directly from the hst multimission archive ( http://archive.stsci.edu ; z3ec0204 t and z3ec0104 m respectively ) .",
    "they were observed with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) using the g200 m grating ( @xmath3 = 25000 ) and the large science aperture ( lsr ) , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath618601906  .",
    "fp splits were not used for these observations @xcite .",
    "barnard29 was observed on 1996 november 30 for 4570s , and roa5701 on 1996 august 3 for 4711s .",
    "following the standard pipeline reduction , the spectra were co - aligned within iraf , using the stsdas package ( version 3.4 ) .",
    "the combined spectrum for each star was then read into dipso and cross - correlated with theoretical spectra to obtain the stellar lsr radial velocities of 228 and + 258 km s@xmath8 for barnard29 and roa5701 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the radial velocities of m13 ( 227.2 km s@xmath8 , @xcite ) and @xmath0cen ( + 240 km s@xmath8 , @xcite ) .",
    "an interstellar reddening correction , of e(b  v ) = 0.02 @xcite for m13 and e(b  v ) = 0.11 @xcite for @xmath0cen , was applied to the appropriate spectrum .",
    "the spectra were then binned , with a wavelength interval of 0.05  , resulting in a wavelength coverage of 18681906   for barnard29 and 18651903   for roa5701 .",
    "non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) model atmosphere grids , calculated using tlusty and synspec , have been used to derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "a summary of the procedures involved are given in @xcite , while a more detailed discussion of the grids and methods may be found in @xcite and @xcite , and also at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk .",
    "briefly , four grids have been produced with metallicities corresponding to [ fe / h ] = 7.5 dex for the galaxy , 7.2 dex and 6.8 dex for the large ( lmc ) and small ( smc ) magellanic clouds , respectively , and 6.4 dex for low metallicity regimes .",
    "for each metallicity grid , approximately 3000 models were calculated for a range of effective temperatures from 12000 to 35000 k , logarithmic gravities ( log  _ g _ = 4.5 dex down to the eddington limit ) and microturbulences of 0 to 30 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the iron abundance was fixed at each grid , while the light element abundances ( c , n , o , mg , si , s ) were allowed to vary from 0.8 to + 0.8 dex around their base ( metallicity ) value .",
    "iron is assumed to dominate the metal line blanketing .",
    "however , the exclusion of nickel in our models should not be a significant source of error in the atmospheric parameters and chemical composition @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric structure is therefore defined by the iron abundance ( metallicity ) , effective temperature , gravity and microturbulence .",
    "it is also assumed that light element abundances can vary with negligible affect on the atmospheric structure , as shown in tests performed by @xcite .",
    "theoretical profiles and equivalent widths of light element transitions were calculated using the models .",
    "a gui interface in idl allows the user to access the theoretical equivalent widths and interpolate these to calculate equivalent widths and abundance estimates for @xmath6200 metal lines , for any set of atmospheric parameters .",
    "abundance increments of 0.4 dex used in the grids were found to be sufficiently small that no significant errors were incurred due to the interpolation procedures @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of each star were determined from the optical spectra . as the parameters are interrelated , an iterative process is used ( see , for example , ) .",
    "studies of giants in m13 yield a cluster metallicity of [ fe / h ] = 1.6 @xcite , while for @xmath0cen , which contains at least three stellar populations , the main cluster giant population indicates [ fe / h ] = 1.6 @xcite . hence , for both stars the grid corresponding to low metallicity regions ( 6.4 dex ; 1.1 dex lower than galactic ) was used , as this was the lowest metallicity model available and thus the most appropriate based on the metallicities of the respective clusters .",
    "@xcite found that using grids of different iron abundances changed the effective temperature estimate by typically @xmath9 500 k , while the gravity and microturbulence estimates were unaffected , so the use of this grid should not be a major source of error .",
    "the adopted atmospheric parameters and associated errors for both stars are listed in table [ tab_ap ] .",

    "initial atmospheric parameters for barnard29 were taken from @xcite , and are @xmath10 = 20000 k , log  _ g _ = 3.0 and @xmath11 = 10 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the temperature estimate remained unchanged at 20000 k with an associated error of @xmath141000 k , the gravity was constrained to log  _ g _ = 2.95 @xmath14 0.10 , while a determination of the microturbulence led to a value of @xmath11 = 4 @xmath14 2 km s@xmath8 .    for roa5701 ,",
    "initial parameters were taken from @xcite , namely @xmath10 = 25000 k , log  _ g _ = 3.25 and @xmath11 = 5 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the present analysis led to no change in the effective temperature .",
    "as no absorption line was detected for heii 4541  , assuming a normal helium abundance also allowed us to place an independent upper limit of @xmath10 @xmath16 26000 k. therefore , the associated error for @xmath10 is @xmath141000 k. the gravity was determined to be log  _ g _ = 3.3 @xmath14 0.1 , and the microturbulence @xmath11 = 1 @xmath15 km s@xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the microturbulent broadening , some rotational broadening may occur .",
    "the effect of this was investigated by fitting instrumentally broadened non - lte theoretical profiles for the siiii multiplet at 4560  , calculated using the appropriate @xmath10 , log  _ g _ and @xmath11 values , to the observed spectra .",
    "the theoretical profiles were rotationally broadened and overlain in order to determine the most appropriate @xmath12sin_i _ ( see @xcite for further details ) .",

    "a microturbulence of 0 km s@xmath8 was assumed for both stars , as a non - zero microturbulence would lead to lower @xmath12sin_i _ estimates @xcite .",
    "this resulted in , for barnard29 @xmath12sin_i _",

    "table [ tab_all ] contains the equivalent width measurements for the observed metal lines , along with the associated abundance estimates .",
    "if more than one line contributed to an equivalent width , the lines were treated as blends within tlusty .",

    "models were calculated , adopting the appropriate atmospheric parameters .",

    "although the lack of a third dredge - up appears a likely explanation for the abundance patterns of the light elements in both stars , @xcite and @xcite explain the abundances of the heavier elements in terms of the gas - dust separation process .",
    "the basic premise involves grain formation that occurs in the circumstellar shells of stars during the agb evolution .",
    "dust particles are removed by radiation pressure and the ` cleaned ' gas is re - accreted onto the surface .",
    "this results in abundances similar to the ism , i.e. cno and s near solar , while other elements such as mg , al , si and ca follow the low fe abundance @xcite and see for example the rvtauri stars uycma , hp lyr and bz sct @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that , in the atmospheres of post - agb stars , metals with a high condensation temperature , e.g. fe , are more likely to condense into dust grains , compared to elements such as c , n , o and s with low condensation temperatures which stay in the gas phase with no significant depletions observed .",
    "@xcite suggested that this process occurred as they found a low fe value , with n and o virtually undepleted , while @xcite also cite the low fe abundance as evidence for the process .",
    "for this scenario , similar depletions of mg , si and fe would therefore be expected .",
    "examining the differential ism abundances ( table [ tab_diff ] ) it is possible to determine if the stars follow the abundance trends seen in gas - dust separation .",

    "the mg , al and fe ( optical ) abundances of barnard29 agree with the value for s and the metallicity and giant abundances of m13 ( [ fe / h ] = 1.6 , @xcite ) , although the si abundance estimate is somewhat larger , possibly due to its sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters . for roa5701 ,",

    "similar results would be obtained if the abundances were compared with young b - type stars instead of the ism .    for gas - dust separation , cno and s",
    "would be expected to be relatively undepleted and not in agreement with mg , si , al or fe .",
    "however , we find that the s abundance is generally in agreement with the mg , si , al and fe(optical ) abundances , suggesting that gas - dust separation has not occurred . also this process is generally confined to binary systems .",
    "the possible binarity of our two stars was investigated using radial velocity measurements .",
    "however a literature search produced sparse results , indicating no conclusions can be made .",

    "dufton ( in preparation ) have observed similar abundance discrepancies for young b - type stars in the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc , lmc ) , as well as in the magellanic bridge ( mb ) .",
    "they determined fe abundances from ghrs / hst and stis / hst spectra , using the same methods and feiii transitions as described here , and found that these were consistently lower ( more than 0.5 dex ) than the estimated metallicities of the smc , lmc and mb regions .",
    "it is possible to derive the abundance of other elements using ultraviolet spectra , but that is not possible here as the ghrs data employed do not cover a large enough spectral range .",

    "currently , atomic data from kurucz models ( http://nova.astro.umd.edu , ) are used in the tlusty grids .",
