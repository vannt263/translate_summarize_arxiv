    "lattice qcd at finite baryon density holds the key to an understanding of the phase transition between quark - confined hadronic matter and the quark - gluon plasma . at zero temperature",
    "we expect this transition to occur at @xmath5 corresponding to the lowest lying state with non - zero baryon number .",
    "+ although the qcd phase transition at finite temperature has been successfully studied on the lattice with simulations predicting a first order transition at a well defined critical temperature , a non - perturbative lattice calculation of nuclear matter at finite density has been an outstanding problem in qcd thermodynamics since 1986@xcite .",
    "the fundamental difficulty in simulating qcd at finite density and investigating the transition quantitatively is that the effective action resulting from the grassmann integration over the fermions is complex due to the introduction of the chemical potential in the dirac matrix .",
    "this complex nature of the qcd finite density action@xcite prohibits the use of naive probabilistic methods in evaluating the functional integral .",
    "thus the standard hybrid monte carlo simulation algorithms for lattice qcd with dynamical fermions are inappropriate in this context since they require a positive definite probability measure .",
    "the study of lattice qcd at finite density is motivated by the need for a full equation of state for nuclear matter in the temperature - chemical potential plane which would give quantitative predictions for critical energies and densities in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "other applications include equations of state for neutron stars and cosmological models of the early universe .",
    "serious problems were first reported in quenched simulations of finite density qcd in 1986@xcite and the physical and mathematical reasons for this failure have been the focus of considerable debate ever since @xcite .    in these early simulations the behaviour of the chiral condensate was studied at fixed quark mass for various different values of the chemical potential , @xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour was initially as expected _ viz . _",
    "the chiral condensate remained constant up until a certain value of mu and then tended to zero as the chemical potential was increased .",
    "we would expect that physical observables are @xmath0 independent up to some @xmath6 which is related to the threshold for baryon production .",
    "the problem encountered was the following : as the quark mass was decreased the @xmath0 at which the chiral condensate began to change also decreased towards zero .",
    "in fact , the onset of chiral symmetry restoration appeared to occur at a chemical potential of half the pion mass , which would extrapolate to zero in the chiral limit .",
    "a study of the distribution of the eigenvalues of the lattice dirac operator confirmed that the lowest mass state containing a net number of fermions ( i.e. a quark or a baryon but not a meson which does not see @xmath0 ) became massless as the bare quark mass was reduced to zero .",
    "the interpretation was that there existed either baryonic states which became massless in the chiral limit and had an energy equal to @xmath7 or stable quark matter with low mass per baryon .",
    "the result that @xmath6 is proportional to the pion mass is clearly unphysical.we expect @xmath8 because the proton is the lightest state with non - zero baryon number . from this",
    "we are drawn to two possible conclusions .",
    "the first possibility is that the quenched approximation is at fault so that it is strictly necessary to consider the complex action of full qcd at finite chemical potential .",
    "secondly , there could be intrinsic problems in the lattice formulation of fermions ( possibly associated with fermion doubling ) and chemical potential which would survive an unquenched treatment .",
    "further studies@xcite of the quenched theory on larger lattices found similar behaviour . however , a recent study @xcite of the quenched theory which measured the condensate and the pion and nucleon masses , did find that , at intermediate and strong coupling , the theory is sensitive to the baryon mass but that it is pathological for @xmath9 .    from an analytical study of the eigenvalues of",
    "the fermionic propagator matrix gibbs@xcite concluded that the eigenmodes of the propagator matrix ( defined below ) relate to the mass spectrum of the theory .",
    "the gibbs argument , requires the calculation of the hadronic spectrum on replicated lattices , i.e. lattices , with periodic boundary conditions on the gauge fields , which have been strung together @xmath10 times in the time direction .",
    "he considered the limit @xmath11 in order to replace finite sums with contour integrations .",
    "the procedure is justifiable at zero temperature .",
    "the expression obtained for the inverse of the duplicated fermion matrix @xmath12 is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 are the amplitudes ( which can be related to the eigenvectors of the propagator matrix ) and @xmath15 are the associated eigenvalues .",
    "the form of the inverse shows that the exponential decay at large separation is controlled by the eigenvalues @xmath15 : thus we see that the eigenvalue spectrum calculated on isolated configurations should contain poles in correspondence to the physical masses .",
    "in particular , the smallest mass state can clearly be extracted from the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "this state is obtained by the squaring the propagator matrix , and defines the pion mass in qcd .",
    "this implies that in the quenched theory @xmath16 is controlled by the _ pion mass_.    it has also been suggested by several authors that the coincidence of the onset of the chiral symmetry restoration with one half of the pion mass might only have been a numerical accident , the correct relationship being @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the contribution of the nuclear binding energy .",
    "if this scenario were true then the problems with finite density simulations would not be too serious .",
    "this conjecture has been tested @xcite .",
    "however this work confirmed the onset at @xmath19 .",
    "recent work by stephanov @xcite using the random matrix method has provided some insight into this particular problem by demonstrating that at nonzero @xmath0 the quenched theory is not a simple @xmath20 limit of a theory with @xmath21 quarks but it is the @xmath20 limit of a theory with @xmath21 quarks and @xmath21 conjugate quarks and therefore inappropriate to qcd.this explanation implies that the phase of the determinant is important for a simulation of full qcd at finite @xmath0 . in the quenched model the early onset for the number density would also correspond to the restoration of chiral symmetry because of the simultaneous occurrence of quarks and conjugate quarks in the system whereas the inclusion of dynamical fermions would result in a rearrangement of the eigenvalues such that the chiral symmetry would be restored at @xmath22 as expected .",
    "the pathologies of quenched studies of the chiral phase transition at finite density indicate that a correct implementation of dynamical quarks in the simulations is essential to the physics of the model .",
    "the problem caused by the non - hermitian nature of the fermion matrix at @xmath23 can be circumvented by a method which involves the expansion of the grand - canonical partition function ( gcpf ) in powers of the fugacity variable @xmath2 .",
    "the gcpf can be expressed as an ensemble average of the fermionic determinant normalised with respect to the fermionic determinant at @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25[du^\\dagger]|m(\\mu)|e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}\\over { \\int [ du][du^\\dagger]|m(\\mu=0)|e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the pure gauge action and @xmath27 is the kogut - susskind fermion matrix .",
    "this means that the probability measure is well - defined and standard hybrid monte - carlo algorithms can be applied .",
    "the gcpf is then given by the ensemble average    @xmath28    the kogut - susskind fermion matrix has the structure :    @xmath29    in which @xmath30 contains all the spacelike gauge links and the bare quark mass and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) all the forward ( backward ) timelike links .",
    "it then follows that , on a lattice of size @xmath33 , the determinant of @xmath27 is given by@xcite    @xmath34    where the propagator matrix @xmath35 is given by    @xmath36    with its inverse given by    @xmath37    from the structure of the propagator matrix and its inverse , it is easily shown that its eigenvalues have the symmetry that if @xmath38 is an eigenvalue then so is @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , since the matrix @xmath31 factors , the eigenvalues have a @xmath40 symmetry . as a consequence of this symmetry ,",
    "the characteristic polynomial for @xmath35 is a polynomial in @xmath41 with @xmath42 complex coefficients .",
    "since the probability for a given configuration of gauge fields to appear in our ensemble is equal to that of its complex conjugate their imaginary parts will average to zero .",
    "we impose this symmetry in the simulations described below . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic polynomial from a configuration ( averaged with its complex conjugate ) is invariant under @xmath43 and has the form :    @xmath44    the chemical potential dependence of the gcpf is then given explicitly by @xmath45 with @xmath46    by measuring the @xmath47 in the simulations we can readily obtain the fermion number density , + @xmath48 and the energy density , @xmath49 .",
    "the relative values of the canonical partition functions can be used to characterize the properties of the system . in particular the relative value of the triality non - zero coefficients give an indication of whether the system is in the confined or deconfined regime . in the confined sector",
    "the ensemble average of the triality non - zero coefficients should tend to zero as the statistics increase .",
    "we see strong evidence for this behaviour is seen in the lattice qcd simulations described below .",
    "we also consider a description of the system in terms of the canonical partition functions for fixed particle number .",
    "this technique allows us to include only those triality zero coefficients which , at the end of the simulation , are positive and have a reasonable error.the chemical potential as a function of the baryon number density is obtained from the local derivative of the energy , @xmath47 , of the state with @xmath50 fermions with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fermion density , @xmath53 .",
    "according to the theorems of lee and yang@xcite the phase structure of a simulated system can be determined by studying the zeros of the gcpf .",
    "the zeros correspond to singularities in the thermodynamic potential .",
    "we study the zeros of the gcpf in the complex chemical potential ( or fugacity plane ) which are given by @xmath54 . according to the lee - yang theorem as the system volume tends to infinity",
    ", the zeros will converge towards the critical value in the physical domain ( real axis ) of the chemical potential .",
    "the glasgow method involves an ensemble generated at @xmath24 .",
    "this may introduce systematic errors due to insufficient overlap when measuring observables at @xmath0 significantly greater than the onset of non - zero number density .",
    "an alternative method involves generating the ensemble either with respect to the absolute value of @xmath55 or with respect to the modulus of its real part@xcite . in these simulations",
    "it is necessary to measure an additional observable related to the average sign of the determinant .",
    "for example , updating with respect to the modulus gives the observable @xmath56 as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the phase of the determinant .",
    "simulations at a fixed quark mass using these methods are well behaved at low and high chemical potentials but for @xmath59 the phase @xmath58 fluctuates violently from configuration to configuration and @xmath60 becomes very small and is not measurable .",
    "this is the region of @xmath0 in which critical behaviour is expected .",
    "gocksh@xcite used a spectral density method by binning the phase @xmath58 and measuring @xmath61 . on a @xmath62 lattice , his results for @xmath63 are in broad agreement with meanfield .",
    "blum , hetrick and toussaint@xcite have recently studied numerical simulations of lattice qcd in the limit that the quark mass and chemical potential are simultaneously made large . in that limit ,",
    "the quark mass and chemical potential appear only in the ratio @xmath64 and the propagator matrix becomes @xmath65 the corresponding fermion determinant is complex but trivial to evaluate which allows generation of very high statistics in their measurements and determine @xmath66 to sufficient accuracy .    for quenched qcd the high temperature transition is first order and they expected this behaviour to extend into the interior of the @xmath67 phase diagram .",
    "however their simulations showed that this transition becomes a smooth crossover at very small density ( possibly for any nonzero density ) and that , at low enough temperature , chiral symmetry remains broken at all densities .    of course ,",
    "as the authors point out , it is not at all clear that the static approximation has anything to do with real qcd .",
    "however , it is relevant that unexpected results follow in this simple model .",
    "the strong coupling limit of qcd provides us with an important testing ground for lattice monte - carlo simulations at finite density because we can compare our results with the analytic predictions of mean - field theory .",
    "no such analytic predictions are available in the scaling region ( i.e. intermediate coupling ) . at infinite coupling",
    "the mean - field method predicts a _ first order _ transition at chemical potential @xmath68 where    @xmath69    where @xmath70 for a lattice with @xmath10 space - time dimensions where @xmath71 .",

    "it has been argued that the discrepancy is related to the binding energy of nuclear matter which is large at infinite coupling .",
    "bilic et al.@xcite demonstrated explicitly that @xmath76 corrections diminish the discrepancy between @xmath68 and the mass of the lightest baryonic state divided by @xmath77 ( the number of colours ) .",
    "the mean - field pion thresholds and @xmath68 are not well separated for bare quark masses @xmath78 .",
    "monte - carlo su(3 ) simulations@xcite using the monomer - dimer algorithm whereby the partition function is represented in terms of monomers , dimers and baryonic loops estimate a critical chemical potential , @xmath63 which is in agreement with @xmath68 .",
    "this algorithm involves integrating out the gauge fields exactly and subsequently integrating the quark fields .",
    "hybrid monte - carlo techniques integrate the quark fields prior to the gauge fields .",
    "the monomer - dimer algorithm can not be used to explore small bare quark masses @xmath79 and is restricted to the infinite coupling regime where the quarks are point - like .",
    "consider again the expression for the gcpf    @xmath80    the zeros of this polynomial are the lee - yang zeros of @xmath81 in the complex fugacity plane ( or equivalently the complex @xmath82 plane ) . in the dynamical theory these zeros play a role analogous to that of the eigenvalues of @xmath35 in the quenched theory when calculating the number density .",

    "since @xmath88 we can interpret the zeros of the partition function as the proper ensemble average of the eigenvalues of the fermionic propagator matrix .",
    "one obvious constraint on the distribution of the zeros is that in the confined sector we expect to see a @xmath89 symmetry arising from the triality non - zero coefficients averaging to zero so that only canonical partition functions containing multiples of three quarks contribute to the thermodynamics .",
