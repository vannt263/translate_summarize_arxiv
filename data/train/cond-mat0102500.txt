    "the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena has been an attractive and important topic in statistical physics for a long time @xcite .",
    "as is well known there appears critical universality due to the infinite spatial and time correlation lengths at the continuous phase transition points , and the universal behavior of a critical system is characterized by a number of critical exponents such that the models in the same universality class have the same values of the critical exponents .",
    "therefore , an estimation of critical exponents to determine the universality class for different statistical models is an interesting challenge .",
    "however such research is difficult to be carried out analytically since only few statistical models can be exactly solved @xcite .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations supply a powerful method to estimate critical exponents which are measured by generating equilibrium states and averaging over independent configurations in monte carlo ( mc ) studies .",
    "for example , the dynamical exponent @xmath1 can be measured from the exponential decay of time correlation for finite systems in the long - time regime .",
    "unfortunately , mc simulations near the critical point in the equilibrium suffer from critical slowing down ( csd ) @xcite , because the auto - correlation length @xmath4 divergs as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the linear size of a lattice and @xmath7 .    in the last decade , the exploration of critical phenomena has been greatly broadened and much progress has been made in critical dynamics .",
    "an important discovery is that there exist critical scaling and universality for systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "traditionally , it was believed that universal behavior exists only in the equilibrium or in the long - time regime of dynamical evolutions .",
    "however , recent researches in critical dynamics for many statistical models have shown that universal scaling behavior also emerges within the macroscopic short - time regime of dynamic processes after a microscopic time scale @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the _ short - time critical dynamics _ ( stcd ) not only exhibits the existence of universal dynamic scaling behavior within the short - time regime , but also supplies a very efficient method to determine the critical exponents .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the recent progress in short - time dynamical studies has been reviewed , where several simulation methods and the corresponding numerical results have been presented .",
    "up to now , the values of critical exponents for a variety of statistical models , such as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) potts and @xmath9 models on a square lattice @xcite , the 2d quantum xy and the random - bond potts models on the square lattices @xcite , the 2d ffxy model and ( 2 + 1)d su(2 ) lattice - gauge models @xcite , have been calculated precisely .",
    "but only very few attention has been concentrated on the 2d triangular lattices @xcite .    by the stcd method",
    "we can estimate not only the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 , but also the static critical exponents @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "more important , the results for both the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 and static critical exponents , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are consistent with those obtained by the traditional mc simulations performed in equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , similar to the measurements of critical exponents , the determination of critical temperatures is also difficult in equilibrium because of the csd .",
    "now we have an alternative approach , the stcd , by which the critical temperature can be also extracted from the power - law scaling behavior in the critical regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can perform comprehensive investigations on statistical models by the stcd approach which are independent of the study in equilibrium .    in this paper",
    "we present our numerical study for the @xmath10-state potts model on a 2d triangular lattice by using the stcd method . generally , in short - time mc simulations",
    ", there are two different schemes to calculate the critical exponent : one is based on the power - law behavior and the other on the finite size scaling collapse for different lattice sizes within the non - equilibrim relaxation processes . our attention",
    "is specially paid to the universal short - time evolution from the fully ordered initial state .",
    "the calculations show evidence that there exists universal scaling already in the short - time regime where the power - law behavior of magnetization and auto - correlation is observed , as well as the finite size scaling collapse behavior .",
    "these results are then applied to estimate the critical exponents and check the corresponding results for different schemes .",
    "our numerical results confirm explicitly the universality proposal in the short - time regime @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath10-state potts model with ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath11 ) defined on a 2d triangular lattice is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the sum over the lattice sites on a triangular lattice @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denotes the nearest - neighbors of site @xmath16 , whose coordinate number is six on the lattice .",
    "@xmath17 is a spin variable on every lattice site @xmath16 .",
    "it is known that in equilibrium the potts model is exactly solvable , and the critical points are @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 cases and calculate their critical exponents ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) to investigate the universality explicitly .    as our starting point",
    "we consider an @xmath22 vector model ( @xmath23 for the ising model ) with the dynamics of model a @xcite and let it suddenly quench from a very high temperature with small initial magnetization @xmath24 to the critical temperature @xmath25 .",
    "janssen , schaub and schmittmann @xcite argued that at the critical temperature dynamic scaling behavior already emerges within the short - time regime as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath28th moment of the magnetization , @xmath29 is the reduced temperature , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the well known static critical exponents and @xmath30 is a scaling factor , while @xmath31 , a _ new independent _ exponent , is the scaling dimension of the initial magnetization @xmath24 . here",
    "a mc sweep over all sites on the lattice is defined as the unit of mc time @xmath32 .    for a sufficiently large lattice ( @xmath33 ) and setting @xmath34 , @xmath35 in the scaling form eq.([general1 ] ) ,",
    "the power - law behavior of time evolution of the magnetization at the critical temperature can be deduced , @xmath36 where @xmath0 is a new dynamic exponent which characterizes the universality in the short - time regime and is related to @xmath31 by @xmath37 .",
    "the relation shows that , after the microscopic time @xmath8 , the magnetization undergoes an initial increase at the critical point and we can easily obtain the result of the exponent @xmath0 based on this power - law form .    on the other hand",
    ", one can also focus on dynamic processes starting from an ordered initial state to estimate exponents @xmath38 and @xmath1 .",
    "although no detailed analytic study has been made about this process , mc simulations in a variety of statistical spin models have shown that there also exists a similar scaling relation @xcite , @xmath39 at the exact critical temperature(@xmath34 ) and setting @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ general2 ] ) leads to a power - law decay for the magnetization , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 here @xmath44 is also the total number of spins defined on the lattices and @xmath45 denotes the average over independent initial configurations and/or random number sequences .",
    "however , the independent determination of @xmath46 seems slightly more complicated than @xmath1 and @xmath38 .",
    "we should differentiate @xmath47 with respect to @xmath4 at the critical point @xmath48 the exponent @xmath46 can be determined from this power - law behavior if the value of @xmath1 is known . in the practice of our numerical calculations , the differential to @xmath4",
    "is substituted with a reasonable small difference @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore the dynamic exponent @xmath1 can be determinated independently . in order to do so",
    ", we introduce a binder cumulant @xmath50 here the second moment of the magnetization @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively . for sufficiently large lattices , finite size scaling analysis",
    "shows a power - law increase of the binder cumulant , @xmath54 based on this feature the dynamic exponent @xmath1 can be determined and then be used to calculate the exponent @xmath46 through eq.([pm ] ) .",
    "as done by many authors @xcite , the critical exponents can be measured both from disordered initial states and ordered initial states .",
    "we perform our investigations involving these two different initial states for mc measurements to obtain more reliable results .",
    "particularly we paid much attention to the scaling forms which describe the dynamic processes from the ordered initial state instead of the disordered initial states to avoid the finite @xmath24 effect on the measured results .",
    "there is also an advantage to reduce the statistical fluctuations for determination of critical exponents and critical temperatures from ordered initial dynamic processes .",
    "then , there is another scheme to estimate these critical exponents , @xmath38 and @xmath1 , based on the finite size scaling collapse @xcite .",
    "the results estimated should be consistent with those obtained by the power - law behavior described above .",
    "this scheme gives an independent check whether our dynamic mc simulations are reliable or not",
    ". set @xmath34 and @xmath55 , according to the dynamic scaling behavior eq .",
    "( [ general1 ] ) , the simple scaling relation for the second moment magnetization @xmath51 is easily obtained @xmath56 using this scaling relation eq.([m2scaling ] ) for a pair of curves of @xmath51 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we can estimate the critical exponents @xmath38 and @xmath1 by searching for the best fit of collapse of the curve @xmath57 through a global scaling factor @xmath60 . also if we input the value of @xmath1 got from the power - law the eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , the value of @xmath38 can also be estimated by the scaling relation eq.([m2scaling ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in previous works @xcite that the results obtained by the metropolis and heat - bath algorithms are consistent with each other and the latter is somewhat more efficient than the former .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , the mc simulation is only performed by the heat - bath algorithm .",
    "samples for average are taken over 150,000 independent initial configurations on the @xmath61 triangular lattices with the periodic boundary conditions using @xmath62 and 128 .",
    "statistical errors are simply estimated by performing three groups of averages selecting different random seeds for the initial configurations .",
    "our simulation is performed at or near the critical temperature .",
    "we begin the study by considering the dynamic process starting from random initial states with small @xmath24 to determine the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "these disordered initial configurations with given values of @xmath24 are prepared by the sharp preparation method @xcite , and the evolutions of the magnetization @xmath41 are measured as a function of mc time @xmath32 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the @xmath65 lattice .",
    "the curves of @xmath41 in a log - log scale are shown in figs . 1 and 2 for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 model , respectively .",
    "obviously , there exist very nice power - law increases of @xmath41 after @xmath66 and all the curves are almost parallel to each other .",
    "thus the @xmath0 can be estimated from the slopes of the curves in the regime of @xmath32=[10 , 200 ] . in table 1 , the values of @xmath0 as a function of initial magnetizations @xmath24 are presented for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then the final results of @xmath0 , after an extrapolation to @xmath67 , are summarized in table 2 both for the models on the triangular and square lattice .",
    "it is found that the values of @xmath0 on the triangular lattice are the same as those on the square lattice .",
    "this calculation shows first evidence of the dynamic universality in the short - time regime .",
    "secondly we study the evolution of magnetizations in the initial stage of the dynamic relaxation starting from fully ordered initial states . in figs.3 and 4 ,",
    "the power - law behavior of the binder cumulant @xmath68 for @xmath10=2 and @xmath10=3 on a lattice with @xmath69 is displayed on a log - log scale , and the nice power - law of @xmath68 is clearly exhibited .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 can be estimated from the slope of the curves : @xmath70 for @xmath10=2 and @xmath71 for @xmath10=3 . in table 2 ,",
    "the values of @xmath1 measured for the two models are presented . for a comparison",
    ", we also list in table 2 the @xmath1 values of the corresponding results on the square lattice .",
    "then , we investigate the short - time behavior of @xmath41 starting from the fully ordered initial state . the time evolution of @xmath41 for the two models is displayed in fig.5 and fig.6 respectively .",
    "here it is shown that the finite size effect is small , since there is almost no difference for the curves of the different lattice sizes . from the slopes of these power - law decay",
    "curves the values of the index @xmath72 is determined .",
    "then the values of @xmath38 are estimated by input of the @xmath1 values .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 for both @xmath10=2 and @xmath10=3 .",
    "our measured results of @xmath38 are more accurate than those obtained in the previous works , compared with the exact values of @xmath73 for the @xmath10=2 ( ising ) and @xmath74 for the @xmath10=3 potts model .    next the mc simulations for @xmath75",
    "are carried out by taking the difference @xmath49 = 0.02 on @xmath6=128 , 64 and 32 lattices . in figs.7 and 8 we plot the evolution of @xmath75 for the two models respectively .",
    "the nearly complete overlap of these curves on the different lattice sizes indicates that the finite size effect can be ignored .",
    "we also notice that the power - law behavior is not yet seen before @xmath76 , as the effect of microscopic time scale @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we measure the exponent @xmath77 from the interval [ 50,500 ] , and the measurements yield the results @xmath46=1.027(6 ) for the @xmath10=2 model and @xmath46=1.223(5 ) for @xmath10=3 . these results are included in table 2 and compared with those on the square lattice .",
    "finally , we study the time evolution of @xmath51 with completely random initial states ( @xmath24=0 ) on lattices up to @xmath78 to estimate the critical exponent @xmath38 and @xmath1 by the finite size scaling collapse scheme , eq.([m2scaling ] ) , as an alternative way . figs.9 and 10",
    "show the time evolution of the second moment of the magnetization @xmath51 for @xmath79 by solid lines .",
    "the dots fitted to the lines show the data collapse for the rescaled variables @xmath59 , @xmath58 and global scaling factor @xmath60 , with the standard least square fitting algorithm . in other words , we rescaled the @xmath51 lines on a larger lattice to a smaller lattice @xmath59 by the scaling factor @xmath80 and the @xmath60 for the pair of different lattice sizes .",
    "the average values for @xmath81 and @xmath1 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are also given in the table 2 .",
    "this step gives a further independent check that the stcd method is efficient and the results of our dynamic mc simulations are reliable .",
    ".the measured values of @xmath0 versus the initial @xmath24 for the ising model ( @xmath20 ) and potts model ( @xmath21 ) on a @xmath65 lattice .",
    "the last column gives the results of @xmath0 after extrapolation to @xmath55 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have systematically investigated the short - time critical dynamics of the @xmath20 ( ising ) and @xmath21 potts models on the 2d triangular lattices by a large - scale dynamic mc simulation .",
    "firstly , by observing the power - law increase of the magnetization @xmath41 from random initial states , the new dynamic exponent @xmath0 has been calculated and its values are the same as those for the corresponding models on the square lattice .",
    "then we paid our attention particularly to the time evolutions of the binder cumulant @xmath68 , magnetization @xmath41 and the derivative @xmath75 from the fully ordered initial state to determine the dynamic exponent @xmath1 and the static critical exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally we checked our results independently by using the finite - size scaling collapse scheme to the time evolutions of @xmath51 from the completely random initial states .",
    "the advantage of the stcd method , by our experience , is that the csd is eliminated because the measurements are carried out at the beginning of the evolution process , rather than in the equilibrium where all the correlation lengths are divergent .    in conclusion ,",
    "the dynamic relaxation in the short - time regime for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 potts models is studied on the 2d triangular lattice , and it is confirmed that , by comparing our estimated results @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 to those on the 2d square lattice , they belong to the same universality class for the corresponding models on different lattices respectively .",
    "our critical scaling analysis strongly suggests that the simulation for the dynamic relaxations can be used to confirm numerically the universality .",
