    "multihop sensor networks , where nodes act not only to sense but also to relay information , have proven advantages in terms of energy efficiency over single hop sensor networks  @xcite . not only is sensor - to - sensor communication useful for necessary tasks like time synchronization  @xcite , for certain kinds of collaborative sensing functions like target tracking  @xcite sensor - to - sensor communication is essential .",
    "the question of how to achieve connectivity arises here just as it does in ad hoc wireless networks with one crucial difference :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is not necessary that every sensor be part of a connected network .",

    "the difference from other ad hoc wireless networks is that each node _ expects _ connectivity as a service provided to it , while in the wasn individual nodes are not important , the overall task is . in this paper",
    "we follow this critical insight to propose sparse easy - to - compute power - efficient constructions for multihop wasns .",
    "we consider two different types of geometric random graphs as the base interconnection structures .",
    "the nodes are modelled by a poisson point process with density @xmath3 on the plane , @xmath4 .",
    "the interconnections between these points are modeled in two ways : 1 ) _ unit disk graphs _ in which there is an edge between two nodes if the euclidean distance between them is at most 1 and 2 ) _",
    "@xmath1-nearest neighbor graphs _ in which each node establishes ( undirected ) edges to the @xmath1 points nearest to it",
    ". we will refer to the former model as @xmath0 and the latter as @xmath2 ( following the notation introduced in  @xcite ) .",
    "the 2 in both these terms denotes the dimension of the space .",
    "both these models display a critical phenomenon .",
    "for @xmath0 it is known that there is a value @xmath10 such that if @xmath11 the graph contains an infinite component  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath2 the density is not relevant , instead haggstrm and meester show that @xmath1 is the critical parameter ( see  @xcite ) i.e. there is a @xmath12 such that for all @xmath13 , @xmath2 has an infinite component . we show that as long as the critical parameters take at least certain values ( which are higher than the critical values ) it is possible in both cases to construct a subgraph of the infinite component with the following properties :    p1 .",
    "( _ sparsity _ ) the subgraph has a maximum degree of 4 .",
    "( _ constant stretch _ ) the distance between any two points in the subgraph is at most a constant factor greater than the euclidean distance between the points .",
    "( _ coverage _ ) the subgraph is infinite and the probability of a square region of @xmath4 _ not _ containing any points of the subgraph decays exponentially with the size of the region .",
    "( _ local computability _ ) each node can determine if it is part of the subgraph by using its location information and by communicating with its immediate neighbours .",

    "@xmath15 ) , @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath6 ) has properties ( p1)-(p4 ) .",
    "these properties align well with the properties of power - efficient spanners studied in the context of ad hoc wireless networks ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pp 177 - 178 ) . )",
    "the difference being that not every point of the point process is required to be part of the network as long as the sensing function is satisfied ( which the coverage property ( p3 ) ensures . ) .",
    "property ( p2 ) is of major consequence to the power consumption of the network .",
    "this follows from the relationship between the stretch in distance between two points and the consequent increase in the power consumed in communicating between them .",

    "clearly a network with property ( p2 ) achieves a constant power stretch since the euclidean distance between two points is a lower bound on the distance between them in both @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence we claim that our constructions are power - efficient up to a constant factor .",
    "additionally we have property ( p3 ) that guarantees coverage of the region being sensed .",
    "we show that the probability that a region does not contain a point of @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) decays exponentially with the size of the region when @xmath28 ( respectively @xmath15 ) . in both cases",
    "the decay is sharper if a larger value of @xmath3 is chosen .",
    "this allows us to achieve a target coverage by increasing the density to a high enough level .",
    "the basic idea behind our constructions is to couple the random graph in @xmath4 with a discrete site percolation process in @xmath9 .",
    "the subgraph we construct mimics the nodes of a percolated mesh .",
    "one important byproduct of our constructions is that they give the best known upper bounds on the critical values for both our setting .",

    "]    the subgraph drawn by connecting representative points through relay points will be the network we will use for sensing . in order to prove properties ( p1)-(p4 ) we will couple the tiling with a site percolation process in @xmath9 .",
    "we associate each tile in @xmath4 with a point in @xmath9 .",
    "we declare a site in @xmath9 open only if the tile corresponding to it in @xmath4 is good .",
    "hence the probability that a site is open is equal to the probability that its corresponding tile is good .",
    "our definitions of representative and relay points will ensure that if two neighbouring tiles are good then their representative points are connected through their relay points as shown in figure  [ fig : tiled - coupling ] .",

    "since paths in @xmath9 corresponds to paths between points in @xmath4 it follows that if percolation occurs in the @xmath9 then an infinite component must exist in the geometric random graph model as well .",
    "hence we can conclude that if the probability of a tile being good exceeds the critical probability for site percolation , the geometric random graph model also has an infinite component in it almost surely .",
    "let us now take a more specific look at the constructions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",

    "we consider square tiles of side 4/3 .",
    "for the sake of exposition let us assume that the tile shown in figure  [ fig : udg - coupling ] is centred at ( 0,0 ) and it s lower left corner is ( -2/3 , -2/3 ) . within each tile",
    "we consider five disjoint regions , the representative region @xmath71 , and the relay regions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath71 is a circle of radius 1/2 centred at the origin .",
    "the regions @xmath74 are intuitive to understand but slightly tricky to describe formally .",
    "we describe one of them , @xmath75 . in order to do so ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath76 the tile immediately to the right of the tile @xmath77 i.e. the tile centred at ( 4/3,0 ) with bottom left corner ( 2/3,-2/3 ) .",
    "it s leftmost relay region is @xmath78 .",
    "now we define @xmath75 as the part of the intersection lying wholly within @xmath77 of all circles of unit radius centred at points in @xmath71 and @xmath78 . from this set",
    "we remove all the points of @xmath71 . in the figure the region",

    "this relay point will subsequently connect to the relay point of that neighbor closest to it , which will in turn be connected to the representative point of the neighbour ( see figure  [ fig : udg - coupling - claim ] ) .",

    "like hggstrm and meester s proof for the existence of a critical value  @xcite and teng and yao s proof for the weaker of their two upper bounds on @xmath12  @xcite our proof of theorem  [ thm:2d - bound ] proceeds by constructing a coupling with a site percolation process on @xmath9 .",
    "however , our construction gives a better upper bound than teng and yao s improvement of their own result ( also in  @xcite ) to @xmath123 which uses a coupling to a mixed percolation process .",
    "hence we state this result as a theorem :    [ thm:2d - bound ] for @xmath2 , @xmath124    having described the constructions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 and having shown that there are values of the critical parameters for which these constructions exist , let us now proceed to show that these constructions indeed have constant stretch .",
    "in this section we prove that our constructions have constant stretch with high probability when the critical parameters have high enough values .",
    "we also show that the coverage of our constructions is very good in a probabilistic sense .",
    "the argument for constant stretch of both @xmath125 and @xmath126 follow similar lines so we present them together . for the purposes of this section we denote the tile lengths chosen for the two constructions as @xmath127 (= 4/3 ) and @xmath128 (= 0.893 ) . in what follows ,",
    "all arguments hold for both settings except where explicitly noted otherwise .",
    "also in the following we implicitly assume that @xmath15 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider any two tiles @xmath129 and @xmath130 whose representative points @xmath131 and @xmath132 lie @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "first we relate the distance in the ( unpercolated ) lattice to the euclidean distance between these two points by observing a simple fact .",
    "[ fct : euclidean - lattice ] given the constants @xmath133 defined in claim  [ clm : coupling : udg ] and @xmath118 defined in claim  [ clm : coupling : udg ] , then for two tiles @xmath134 @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively .",
    "fact  [ fct : euclidean - lattice ] along with lemma  [ lem : antal ] gives us the following theorem :    [ thm : constant - stretch ]    1 .",
    "for @xmath5 , with @xmath138 there are constants @xmath139 and @xmath140 depending only on @xmath3 such that @xmath141 2",
    ".   for @xmath6 , with @xmath142 there are constants @xmath27 and @xmath143 depending only on @xmath1 such that @xmath144    theorem  [ thm : constant - stretch ] is an existential result . in section  [ sec : algorithmic ] we will show how to actually find the constant stretch paths in a distributed way with bounded overhead .",
    "for now we proceed to show that our constructions have good coverage .",
    "let us consider a square region of size @xmath145 .",
    "let us call this @xmath146 .",
    "we will argue that the probability that @xmath146 contains no point of @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) decays exponentially with @xmath147 . as before the arguments here also apply to both the models .",
    "we claim the following theorem :    [ thm : coverage ]    1 .   for @xmath138",

    "there are constants @xmath150 depending only on @xmath1 such that @xmath151 \\leq c_5 \\cdot \\ell^2 \\cdot e^{-c_6    \\cdot \\ell}.\\ ] ]    let us denote by @xmath152 the set of tiles fully or partially contained in the @xmath146 .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath153 i.e. the set of all points in @xmath9 which are images of the tiles in @xmath152 under the mapping defined earlier . for @xmath154 to be empty , each point of @xmath153 must be outside the infinite cluster of the supercritical percolation process . with this insight",
    "we now refer the reader to theorems  8.18 and 8.21 of  @xcite dealing with the radius of finite clusters in the supercritical phase . a slight modification of the proof of theorem 8.21 of ( due to  @xcite ) will yield the the proof of theorem  [ thm : coverage ] .",
    "the details are tedious and do not add anything to the proof described in  @xcite so we omit them here .",
    "theorem  [ thm : coverage ] yields the following simple corollary    1 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath155 such that for @xmath156 @xmath149 < \\frac{1}{n}.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath157 such that for @xmath158 @xmath151 < \\frac{1}{n}.\\ ] ]    the constants @xmath155 and @xmath157 may be larger than what the network requires for its sensing function .",
    "it seems intuitive that adding more nodes should decrease the values of these constants , but the statement of theorem  [ thm : coverage ] does not seem to provide this",
    ". however we claim this intuition is indeed satisfied for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in order to use theorem  [ thm : coverage ] to provide a guarantee of desired coverage , we argue that the exponential decay indeed grows sharper when the density @xmath3 increases .",
    "this is true for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    for the case of @xmath5",
    "it is not hard to see , since an increase in @xmath3 directly leads to an increase in the probability of a tile being good .",
    "this , through the coupling , increases the probability of the corresponding site in @xmath9 being open .",
    "in the site percolation setting the probability of a site being part of the infinite cluster , @xmath159 is known to increase montonically with the probability @xmath48 of sites being open .",
    "our claim follows because the increase in @xmath159 is centrally involved in the ( omitted ) proof of theorem  [ thm : coverage ] .",
    "the claim has a slightly subtler provenance for @xmath6 .",
    "essentially the argument is that if we fix some value @xmath15 , increasing the density @xmath3 allows us to use tiles of smaller side length and still achieve the desired probability ( @xmath160 ) of a tile being good .",
    "this implies that the number of tiles within a region increases , and hence the exponential decrease becomes sharper .",
    "we now focus on the algorithmic issues involved in building @xmath5 and @xmath2 and routing packets in them once they are built .      after the nodes are laid out in their positions they have to undertake four basic steps .",
    "firstly , they have to identify which tile they belong to .",
    "this involves using their location information ( assumed to be of the form @xmath161 ) and the value of the tile width ( denoted @xmath127 for @xmath5 and @xmath128 for @xmath6 ) programmed into the nodes . in the second step",
    "each node determines whether it belongs to one of the special regions within the tile as described in section  [ sec : coupling ] . in the third step all the nodes within a region",
    "communicate to elect a leader who is then designated as the representative point of the tile or a relay point , as applicable . in the fourth step",
    "the elected points of each region form connections with the leaders of their neighbouring regions .",
    "see figure  [ fig : formation ] for a formal statement of the algorithm for building @xmath5 .",
    "the algorithm for @xmath6 is very similar .    the function electleader can be realized using any distributed leader election algorithm on a complete graph topology since all the nodes within a region can talk to each other ( see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the function named connect is simply a handshake between the two nodes mentioned .",
    "once the calls to this function are over the set up phase is completed .",
    "note that the algorithm of figure  [ fig : formation ] will not just form the largest component but will also form other small components .",
    "it is possible to detect how large a given component is by attempting to send packets to distant nodes .",
    "the nodes of a small component can then turn themselves off if they realize they are not part of @xmath5 .",
    "detecting connectivity is an area of research in itself so we do not address the issues here , refering the reader to some recent work in this area  @xcite .      for routing purposes the representative points of a tile act as if they are open lattice points in @xmath9 .",
    "they use relay points to send packets to the representative points of their neighbouring good tiles ( see figure  [ fig : metric - path ] ) hence realizing open edges in @xmath9 . with this simple idea in place , we can just plug in any algorithm which performs routing in the percolated mesh .",
    "we rely on the algorithm for efficient distributed routing in the giant component of a percolated mesh given by angel et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "their algorithm proceeds by trying to follow a shortest path from source to destination .",
    "if at any point the path is broken ( i.e. one of the nodes is closed ) they try to find the next node along the path that is open by performing a distributed bfs from the current location of the packet . for our purposes",
    "we assume that the canonical shortest path between any two nodes @xmath162 is the @xmath163 path : the path that proceeds to first fix the @xmath44 coordinate then the @xmath46 coordinate i.e. @xmath164 .",
    "we describe the routing algorithm in figure  [ fig : routing ] .",
    "the function computenext mentioned in figure  [ fig : routing ] finds the next node along the @xmath163 path .",
    "the function isopen involves checking if the next tile along the path is good or not .",
    "this can be done by asking the relevant relay if it has a neighbour in the target tile .",
    "the function sendto uses the relays to pass the packet to the representative node of the next tile which then continues the routing process .",
    "this is the simple part of the algorithm .",
    "if the target tile is not good a bfs is launched to find the next good tile along the @xmath163 path .",
    "this is a distributed algorithm that requires nodes to be probed as the search proceeds .",
    "finally when it finds the destination it has to also report the path back to the node that launched the search .",
    "once this path is known the function sendtonode sends the packet along this path to the discovered node .",
    "we refer the reader to angel et .",
    "@xcite for a proof that the expected number of probes required for this algorithm is at most a constant times the length of the shortest path .",
    "in this paper we have shown that it is possible to construct sparse power - efficient wireless ad hoc sensor networks with good coverage if we are willing to accept a certain level of redundancy in the system .",
    "ideas from percolation theory have been used to demonstrate that the infinite cluster of two kinds of geometric random graphs contains a good subgraph with the properties that we seek and that this subgraph can be built efficiently using only local information .",
