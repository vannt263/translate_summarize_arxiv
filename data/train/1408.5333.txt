    "<S> the problem of the klein tunneling across a potential barrier in bi - layer graphene is addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the electron wave functions are treated as massive chiral particles . </S>",
    "<S> this treatment allows us to compute the statistical complexity and fisher - shannon information for each angle of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of these magnitudes with the transmission coefficient through the barrier is performed . </S>",
    "<S> the role played by the evanescent waves on these magnitudes is disclosed . due to the influence of these waves </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the statistical measures take their minimum values not only in the situations of total transparency through the barrier , a phenomenon highly anisotropic for the klein in bi - layer graphene .    and    statistical indicators ; transmission coefficient ; klein tunneling ; evanescent waves ; bi - layer graphene    in this work , we are concerned with the calculation of entropic magnitudes in a particular quantum scattering process through a potential barrier , specifically the klein tunneling in bi - layer graphene , a subject that can have interest in applied condensed - matter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the crossing of potential barriers by quantum particles is a typical situation found in different quantum phenomena @xcite , such as tunneling @xcite , interferences @xcite , resonances @xcite , electron transport @xcite , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> a finite square barrier can be a first example where to study the relationship of these entropy - information measures with the reflection coefficient . in the context of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( nrqm ) </S>",
    "<S> , it has been put in evidence @xcite that these statistical magnitudes present their minimum values just in the situations where the total transmission through the barrier is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> a similar result was obtained for the crossing of a barrier in a relativistic - like quantum mechanics context @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of the so - called klein tunneling @xcite in single - layer graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> the klein tunneling ( or paradox ) is an exotic phenomenon with counterintuitive consequences in relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) that has deserved a great interest in particle , nuclear and astro - physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> klein @xcite showed that , in the frame of rqm , it is possible that all incident particles ( electrons in the case of graphene ) can cross a barrier , independently of how high and wide the potential barrier is . </S>",
    "<S> this is a paradoxical fact from the point of view of the nrqm , where we know that the higher and wider the potential barrier is , less number of particles can tunnel the barrier ( exponential decay ) . </S>",
    "<S> the klein paradox has never been realized in laboratory experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , a possibility to observe this type of phenomenon has recently been proposed and tested by means of graphene @xcite .    from an electronic point of view , bi - layer graphene is a 2d gapless semiconductor with chiral electrons and holes with a finite mass @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of these quasiparticles is a non - relativistic consequence of their parabolic energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the chirality comes from the spinorial nature of their wavefunction , similar to the chirality of the carriers in single - layer graphene that can be viewed as relativistic fermions , in that case massless due to their linear energy dispersion at low fermi energies . for the present case of the bilayer graphene </S>",
    "<S> , the quadratic energy dispersion implies four possible solutions for a given energy @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the fermi wavevector of the quasiparticle , and @xmath6 is the effective mass of the carriers @xcite , with @xmath7 the electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> two solutions correspond to propagating waves and the other two to exponentially growing and decaying waves ( evanescent waves ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of these wavefunctions can be found by solving the off - diagonal hamiltonian that describes the low - energy quasiparticles in bilayer graphene @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 .    in order to study the klein tunneling in bi - layer graphene , a two - dimensional square potential barrier @xmath10 is considered on the @xmath11 plane :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the height and width of the barrier , respectively , and the dimension along the @xmath15 axis is supposed to be infinite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this potential barrier has the klein tunneling as the most intriguing effect for @xmath16 , where electrons outside the barrier transform into holes inside it , or vice versa , a phenomenon that allows to the charge carriers to pass through the barrier . in the case of bi - layer graphene </S>",
    "<S> , this charge conjugation requires the appearance of evanescent waves ( holes with wavevector @xmath17 ) inside the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this local potential barrier can be created by the electric field effect using local chemical doping or by means of a thin insulator @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we consider an electron wave that propagates under the action of the hamiltonian @xmath18 at an incident angle @xmath19 respect to the @xmath20 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions for the two - component spinor representing these quasiparticles in the different regions are :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the wavevector components of the propagative waves , @xmath24 is the decay rate of the evanescent wave , @xmath25 is the fermi wavevector as given in expression ( [ eqe ] ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , outside the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the correspondent parameters inside the barrier are : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the nine amplitudes ( @xmath35 ) are complex numbers determined , up to a global phase factor , by the normalization condition and the boundary constraints , namely the continuity of both components of the spinor and their derivatives , at @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> all of them can be numerically calculated . </S>",
    "<S> remark that divergent exponential waves only take place in region @xmath38 and the evanescent ( exponentially decaying ) waves appear in the three regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering region ( region ii ) provokes a partial reflection of the incident electron wave . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient @xmath39 gives account of the proportion of the incoming electron flux that is reflected by the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath39 is : @xmath40    in this process , there are no sources or sinks of flux , then the transmission coefficient @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient @xmath41 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ( dashed line ) for a given height @xmath13 of the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the behavior of @xmath41 is evident in that figure but contrarily to the single - layer graphene case , where massless dirac fermions in normal incidence ( @xmath43 ) are perfectly transmitted through the barrier @xcite , here in the bi - layer graphene case the massive chiral fermions are always totally reflected for angles close to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the total transparency , @xmath44 , can be found for other angles of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the paradoxical klein tunneling in graphene consisting in the penetration of its charge carriers through a high and wide barrier , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath41 ( and all other magnitudes plotted in the figures ) has been performed by taking for the electron and hole concentration the typical values used in experiments with graphene ( see ref . </S>",

    "<S> the density is a constant in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> then , without loss of generality , if we take a length of unity in the @xmath15 direction , the density does not depend on @xmath57 variable , @xmath58 . </S>",
