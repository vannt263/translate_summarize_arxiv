    "self - avoiding classical random walks @xcite are a variation on the standard classical walk , where the walker is unable to revisit any sites it has previously visited .",
    "a one dimensional , classical , completely self - avoiding walk is trivial ; once the first step has been taken by the walker , every step thereafter has only one possibility .",
    "the variance of the walker will always be zero , as after the initial step there is only one possible location for the walker to be at any given step .",
    "self - avoiding random walks become less trivial and more useful in two and three dimensions , but they also become exceedingly difficult to analyse in higher dimensions .",
    "self - avoiding walks have the property that they explore a graph more rapidly , since evolution time is not wasted re - exploring already visited sites .",
    "self - avoiding classical random walks are particularly useful in two and three dimensions as they find applications in modelling solvents and polymers @xcite , protein folding @xcite , molecular conformation , percolation lattices , and drug discovery . when using classical random walks to model the proliferation of forest fires or the propagation of liquids through a porous material  two archetypal applications for classical random walks ",
    "we wish to determine whether a route through a graph exists .",
    "thus , there is no benefit in exploring vertices that have previously been explored and a self - avoiding walk will be far more efficient .",
    "a ( discrete - time ) quantum walk is a bipartite system comprising _ position _ and _ coin _ degrees of freedom , with hilbert space .",
    "the position parameter specifies the location ( vertex ) of the walker in the graph , whilst the coin parameter specifies the direction the walker is heading . on a one - dimensional graph the state of the quantum walker at time",
    "@xmath0 is of the form @xmath1 , where is the discrete position of the walker , and is the direction of the walker ( left or right respectively ) .",
    "the evolution of the walk is specified by unitary _ coin _ ( @xmath2 ) and _ step _ ( @xmath3 ) operators , which have the actions @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath6 is the unitary coin matrix .",
    "thus the coin operator coherently manipulates the direction of the walker , leaving the position unchanged , whilst the step operator uses the coin parameter to update the location of the walker , leaving the coin unchanged .",
    "the evolution of the walk over @xmath0 time steps proceeds as @xmath7 .",
    "one of the interesting features of the quantum walk is that it exhibits a quadratically faster rate of spread ( measured using variance ) compared to the classical random walk .",
    "the variance is defined as , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total probability of finding the walker at location @xmath11 at time @xmath0 , given by summing over the coin degree of freedom , @xmath12 , effectively tracing out the coin .",
    "we fashion our self - avoiding quantum walk with three components : ( 1 ) we record the current position of the walker into the local quantum memory . this",
    "is performed using a ` memory update operator ' ; ( 2 ) we perform the usual coin operator , where the bias of the coin is determined by the state of the memory registers neighbouring the current location of the walker ; ( 3 ) the usual step operator is applied , which results in the walker moving preferentially onto a neighbour whose memory register indicates that the site has not been visited .",
    "an illustration of the components in the self - avoiding quantum walk are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : walker_diagram ] .        _ recording the current position _  to model the self - avoiding quantum walk whereby the walker has memory of its previous location history and avoids positions where it has previously resided , we complement the walker by a sequence of qubits ",
    "one for each site in the lattice  where the qubits indicate whether the walker has previously visited the respective site . in this case",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath0 is of the form , @xmath13 where is the qubit associated with site @xmath14 , and there are @xmath15 sites .",
    "initially , indicating that none of the sites have been visited .",
    "evidently , the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the size of the lattice ( ) , in contrast to linear growth for an ordinary quantum walk ( ) .",
    "this limits our numerical investigations to relatively small evolution times .",
    "we introduce a memory update operator , which updates the memory qubits as a function of the walker s position .",
    "we have chosen to implement the memory update operator unitarily , which implies that the memory is reversible and temporary , and that the record will evaporate after a second visit to the respective site .",
    "a permanent memory recording would require a lindblad model , which would introduce decoherence into the system .",
    "taking our memory recording to be unitary we fix it to be of the form , @xmath16 a pauli @xmath17 rotation applied to the @xmath11th qubit . now @xmath18 determines the strength of the action of the position on the memory . in the extreme case",
    "where , if the walker has not previously visited site @xmath11 , the memory update operator flips the respective qubit to mark that this position has now been visited .",
    "of course , a second visit to the site will flip the qubit again , marking that the site has not been visited .",
    "note that this latter property is unavoidable if the evolution is to remain unitary .",
    "if the position has no effect on the memory and the memory only couples with position via the coin operator .",
    "_ biasing the coin according to neighbouring memory registers _  the coin operator is defined analogously to the usual quantum walk coin operator , @xmath19 where is a coin matrix that depends on the state of the qubit at location @xmath11 , @xmath20 .",
    "this operator coherently manipulates the coin degree of freedom locally , whilst leaving the position and memory qubits unchanged .",
    "the choice of coin matrix is a function of the local memory qubit  when we let ( a usual balanced walk with equal amplitudes of stepping in either direction ) , and when we let .",
    "here , @xmath21 is a general pauli @xmath17 rotation , @xmath22 thus , implements an identity gate , implements a full bit - flip , and implements a balanced step .",
    "our memory will have the effect that if the @xmath11th qubit is set ( indicating that we previously visited location @xmath11 ) then the coin operator implements a partially reflecting mirror on the walker s dynamics , with strength determined by @xmath23 .",
    "this mirror is located at spatial location @xmath11 and the reflectivity ( @xmath24 ) is determined by @xmath23 ( when @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and when @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath23 controls how strong the effect of memory on the coin is .",
    "the probability of being reflected at a site where the memory is set is given by , otherwise it is given by .",
    "_ propagating the walker _  the step operator is defined in the usual way  it updates the position as a function of the coin parameter , @xmath29 the step operator affects only the position , leaving the coin and memory systems unchanged .",
    "_ combined evolution _ ",
    "the total evolution now progresses as , @xmath30^t { |\\psi(0)\\rangle},\\ ] ] where a single step begins with memory recording , followed by the coin operator , and finally the step operator .",
    "our formalism differs from that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where no memory was required to ensure self - avoidance .",
    "rather , the coin matrix was chosen so as to guarantee there is always zero amplitude in the reverse direction .",
    "this is the so - called ` non - reversing quantum walk ' .",
    "however , such a formalism is constrained by the fact that one is unable to tune between different memory strengths , making our formalism much more versatile , as we will see in the next section .",
    "to characterise the self - avoiding walk we will again consider the variance of the position probability distribution against time .",
    "we compute the variance , where now @xmath10 is obtained by summing over the coin and memory degrees of freedom , @xmath31 effectively tracing out the coin and memory subsystems .    in the purely classical case @xmath32 , and in the quantum case @xmath33 .",
    "in our quantum walk with memory we anticipate more elaborate dynamics , which we will now explore and characterise .",
    "in we plot the variance of the self - avoiding quantum walk against varying memory recording ( @xmath18 ) and coin back - action ( @xmath23 ) when evolved 7 steps . in all cases",
    "the regular coin is fixed as a balanced coin , @xmath34 .",
    "here we have employed the symmetrised input state , @xmath35 which guarantees symmetric position probability distributions in the case of the standard unbiased quantum walk .",
    "each point in the plot in corresponds to the final variance of an entire quantum walk with given choices of coin back - action and memory recording . to understand these dynamics ,",
    "the insets illustrate the complete quantum walk evolution dynamics corresponding to some individual points in the plot .",
    "we observe that the variance is maximal when the memory has maximum recording strength ( ) and the coin has identity back - action ( ) , as shown in . because the memory recording strength is maximal",
    ", the memory qubit corresponding to the initial location is set .",
    "then , because the qubit is set , the identity coin will be applied , which propagates the walker outwards . at the next step the same process applies ,",
    "marking the current site and propagating the walker outwards .",
    "thus , the two terms in the symmetrised input state shoot off in straight line paths in opposite directions , yielding maximum quadratic variance against time . fitting to a second order polynomial ,",
    "@xmath36 the second order coefficient of the aforementioned maximum variance walk is , compared to for the ideal quantum walk , reflecting the significantly faster rate of spread of the , self - avoiding quantum walk compared to the normal ideal quantum walk .",
    "intuitively , the maximum variance in this case appears to be a result of the choice of symmetrised input state .",
    "we expect that if we instead adopt an unsymmetrised input state , @xmath37 there will be only a single straight line trajectory in one direction , yielding zero variance .",
    "this is confirmed in .",
    "thus , we see that the variance of the self - avoiding quantum walk is highly dependent on the initial choice of input state , and can in fact swap us between maximal and zero variance . illustrates the variance of an unsymmeterised input state across all parameter regimes .    , @xmath25 , with symmetrised ( left ) and unsymmetrised ( right ) input states ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : input_sym ] and [ eq : input_asym ] respectively ) .",
    "this illustrates the high sensitivity of the dispersion to the initial state , as the former exhibits the maximum possible variance , whereas the latter exhibits zero variance.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath25 , with symmetrised ( left ) and unsymmetrised ( right ) input states ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : input_sym ] and [ eq : input_asym ] respectively ) .",
    "this illustrates the high sensitivity of the dispersion to the initial state , as the former exhibits the maximum possible variance , whereas the latter exhibits zero variance.,title=\"fig : \" ]    ) .",
    "contrast the different dynamics with where a symmetrised input state was employed .",
    "in particular , note the drastically different variance at , compared to the symmetrised case  the maxima in the symmetrised plot corresponds to the minima of the unsymmetrised plot . note the different viewing angle than . ]    in the intermediate case of @xmath38 , the coin creates a superposition , yielding lower variance than .    in the case of and we observe statistics that are qualitatively very classical ( ) . this is because now the coin is a @xmath39 rotation irrespective of the memory ( recall that also ) , yielding a balanced walk , regardless of history .",
    "but simultaneously the memory register is highly entangled with the position degree of freedom , which , upon being traced out , yields decoherence , which can cause a transition from a quantum to a classical walk .",
    "this transition was nicely experimentally demonstrated by broome _",
    "@xcite in the optical context .",
    "if we increase the memory recording strength to , whilst retaining , the walker is maximally entangling with the memory , yielding complete decoherence upon tracing out the memory .",
    "thus , in this instance we observe the binomial distribution and linear variance associated with the ideal classical walk ( ) .    when there is no memory recording and so no entanglement between the memory and the walker . the memory stays permanently fixed at its initial value and thus the coin is always the coin , yielding a balanced quantum walk , irrespective of @xmath23 ( ) .",
    "thus , when , the memory recording strength can tune us between a perfect classical walk ( @xmath40 ) and a perfect quantum walk ( @xmath41 ) .    in the limiting case of maximum coin back - action ( ) and maximum memory recording strength ( ) , the walker resists outward diffusion , yielding a distribution more localised around the origin ( ) . this is because as the walker visits sites the respective memory qubit is completely flipped , toggling between marking the site as visited or not visited . when visited , the walker will incur a full bit - flip , sending the walker back whence it came .",
    "otherwise a balanced coin is implemented and the walker spreads equally in both directions .",
    "thus , on alternate steps the walker either completely flips direction or spreads evenly in both directions , resulting in reduced outward diffusion compared to a normal balanced walk .",
    "an interesting feature of is to note that @xmath42 is not monotonically related to @xmath23 and @xmath18 . for low values of @xmath23",
    "we see that @xmath43 increases monotonically with @xmath18 , whereas for large @xmath23 it decreases with @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , for large @xmath18 , @xmath43 decreases monotonically with @xmath23 , whereas for small @xmath18 it increases with @xmath18 .",
    "however , the non - monotonic nature of @xmath43 may be due to the small values of @xmath0 that we are able to simulate . in the case of unsymmetrised input states",
    "[ fig:3d_asym ] ) the dynamics are even more complex .    evidently , different parameter regimes for @xmath23 , @xmath44 and @xmath18 yield different couplings between the different subsystems when acted upon by the coin , step and memory operators .",
    "the couplings are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] .",
    "the coin operator will couple all three subsystems , provided that .",
    "the step operator will always couple the coin and position subsystems , irrespective of @xmath23 , @xmath44 and @xmath18 . and",
    "the memory operator will couple the position and memory subsystems provided that @xmath45 .    , @xmath44 and @xmath18 .",
    "the coin operator couples all three subsystems , provided that .",
    "the memory operator couples the position and memory subsystems , provided that .",
    "the step operator couples the position and coin subsystems , irrespective of the parameters . ]",
    "in the classical case , self - avoiding random walks can be constructed in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , a classical random walk could be completely self - avoiding , in the sense that it may never return to a visited site .",
    "more generally , a metric could be defined , which specifies the probability with which a walker may return to a previously visited site . in refs .",
    "@xcite such a metric is defined as , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the probability of stepping to site @xmath14 , @xmath48 is the number of times site @xmath14 has been previously visited , is the strength of the self - avoidance ( is an ordinary classical random walk , is a completely self - avoiding walk , and is a weakly self - avoiding walk ) , and @xmath49 sums over the nearest neighbours of the current vertex .",
    "thus , the probability of returning to a given site is weighted exponentially with the number of times the respective site has been visited . using this formalism one can tune between a regular non - self - avoiding classical random walk , a weakly self - avoiding random walk , or a completely self - avoiding random walk .",
    "a generic characteristic of such a self - avoiding classical random walk is that as @xmath50 increases the walker is more likely to be found further away from the origin .",
    "the self - avoidance metric given in eq .",
    "[ eq : classical_soft ] biases how likely the walker is to revisit a site given its prior visitation history and the strength of the self - avoidance , @xmath50 .",
    "however , this bias requires the total number of previous visits to each site . to compare with our quantum self - avoiding walk we restrict to the case where @xmath40 .",
    "then the memory is marked and then unmarked at subsequent visits , i.e. the bias effectively depends on the number of visits modulo 2 .",
    "therefore , we modify eq .",
    "[ eq : classical_soft ] to count modulo 2 , such that , @xmath51 alternately , one could achieve a situation more analogous to eq .  [ eq : classical_soft ] by replacing the qubits in the self - avoiding quantum walk with qu-@xmath52-its and letting the memory recording implement @xmath53 , thus giving us the ability to record up to @xmath52 instances of previous visits",
    ". however we will not explore this option given the computational intractability .    as discussed earlier , in the quantum case when we have maximum coupling between the walker and the memory , yielding a decoherence effect .",
    "thus , we expect the comparison between the classical self - avoiding random walk and the quantum self - avoiding walk to be closest in the regime where .    , where @xmath50 is the self - avoidance strength .",
    "the fitting is calculated over 200 time steps and 1000 repetitions .",
    "when we reduce to a normal balanced classical random walk , which exhibits linear spread and thus ( analogous to fig .  [",

    "<S> , however , we consider the case where the memory is of previous positions rather than of previous coins .    </S>",
    "<S> self - avoiding quantum walks may find applications in situations where ordinary quantum walks have been applied , but where we explicitly wish to avoid re - exploring previously visited sites . while classical self - avoiding walks have been applied to modelling protein folding @xcite , long - chain polymers @xcite and molecular conformation , </S>",
    "<S> perhaps quantum self - avoiding walks may be applied to modelling the analogous problems in the quantum context .    in our model </S>",
    "<S> each vertex in the graph is complimented by a qubit , which marks whether the site has previously been visited . </S>",
    "<S> as the walker walks it leaves a record on the site at which it is presently located . </S>",
    "<S> the coin , which determines the subsequent step direction , is biased to avoid walking onto previously marked sites . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that due to the unitarity of our model , we can not maintain a permanent record of where the walker has been and the walker has some chance of revisiting previously visited sites .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that self - avoiding quantum walks exhibit diverse diffusive characteristics , ranging from ideal classical to ideal quantum walk dynamics , and a plethora of more elaborate behaviours . in the limit of maximum self - avoidance , the walk can exhibit significantly faster rate of spread than an ordinary quantum walk . </S>"
