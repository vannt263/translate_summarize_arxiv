    "the financial markets represent probably the most complex structure that is associated with the contemporary civilization .",
    "they involve extremely many constituents , many different space and time scales and an uncountable number of convoluted factors that drive the financial dynamics towards a real complexity .",
    "its most relevant feature is a permanent competitive coexistence of collectivity and noise .",
    "the related quantitative characteristics can be studied using multivariate ensembles of parameters that represent dynamics of various financial assets . due to this multi - dimensionality the most natural and efficient formal frame to quantify the whole variety of effects connected with complexity is in terms of matrices  @xcite . since the dynamics of complexity",
    "is inherently embedded in noise , the random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite offers an appropriate reference .",
    "deviations from rmt help to detect real information and to potentially extract it from what is universal in the rmt sense and thus practically not very informative",
    ". an extremely useful matrix approach to the financial dynamics is based on using the correlation matrices formed from ( i ) the time series representing the price changes of a certain basket of different assets over the same period of time or ( ii ) from the time series representing different disconnected periods of time ( days or weeks ) for either a single asset or an index .",
    "the simplest commonly used variant of rmt to serve as a null hypothesis in these cases corresponds to the ensemble of wishart matrices  @xcite .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue distribution @xmath0 is then described by the marchenko - pastur formula  @xcite which confines this distribution within the bounds @xmath1 here @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of time series of length @xmath4 .",
    "relating eigenspectra of the empirical @xmath5 stock market correlation matrices to this formula shows that typically only a few of the eigenvalues , representing a global or some more local collective moves within the market , are located sizeably above @xmath6 while the bulk of the empirical eigenvalue distribution satisfactorily falls within the lower and the upper bound .",
    "this is interpreted as an indication that eigenvectors associated with the bulk are undistinguishable from noise and thus carry no information .",
    "such a situation is quite convincing in the case denoted above as ( ii )  @xcite .",
    "the results of the original study of cross - correlations among the stock market companies were interpreted analogously  @xcite .",
    "a more systematic analysis of this kind of correlations ( case ( i ) above ) shows however  @xcite that they are much more subtle , the overlap of the bulk with the bounds prescribed by rmt dissolves as @xmath4 increases and eigenvectors even from the middle of the spectrum carry significant information .",
    "below we recapitulate the most relevant results and provide some further arguments in favor of the statement that there is nontrivial information encoded also in the bulk of the eigenvalue spectrum of the stock market correlation matrix ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these results should be taken care of also in the context of the markowitz optimal portfolio theory  @xcite and for denoising of the empirical correlation matrices  @xcite .",
    "in the financial context one considers a portfolio @xmath7 consisting of a number of securities @xmath8 associated with weights @xmath9 that reflect the fraction of the total capital invested in a particular security . on the time scale",
    "@xmath10 the return of such a portfolio at the @xmath11 instant of time is the weighted sum @xmath12 of logarithmic price increments @xmath13 of individual securities @xmath14 .",
    "each such return can be considered a product @xmath15 of its sign and of its magnitude @xmath16 which measures the volatility .",
    "these time series can be used to create an @xmath17 data matrix @xmath18 and then a correlation matrix @xmath19 according to the formula @xmath20 each element of @xmath19 is thus the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath21 between a pair of signals @xmath22 and @xmath23 . by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath24 this matrix can be transformed to the diagonal form . from the point of view of investment theories ,",
    "each eigenvector @xmath25 can be considered as a realization of an @xmath3-security portfolio @xmath26 with the weights equal to the eigenvector components @xmath27 . for a non - degenerate matrix @xmath19 , @xmath26 and @xmath28",
    "are independent for each pair of their indices , which allows one to choose such a portfolio , whose risk is independent of others . according to the classical theory  @xcite",
    ", the risk @xmath29 for the relevant group of securities can be related to correlations ( or covariances ) between the time series of individual security returns @xmath30 .",
    "each eigenvector determined by eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) ( and thus portfolio ) can be associated with the corresponding time series of the portfolio s returns by the expression @xmath31 which is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ portreturn ] ) .",
    "these principal value time series we shall call the eigensignals @xmath32 ( see also  @xcite for some alternative realizations ) . the risk associated with such eigensignals is related with the corresponding eigenvalues : @xmath33 thus , the eigenvalue size is a risk measure and , in consequence , the larger @xmath34 , the larger variance of @xmath32 and also the larger risk of the corresponding portfolio @xmath26 .",
    "this study of inter - stock correlations is based on high - frequency data from the american stock market  @xcite in the period 1 dec 1997 @xmath35 31 dec 1999 .",
    "we chose a set of stocks of @xmath36 highly capitalized companies listed in nyse or nasdaq ( capitalization @xmath37 in each case ) .",
    "these stocks are sufficiently frequently traded ( 0.01 - 1 transactions / s ) so that the time scale of @xmath38 min allows to perform a statistically significant analysis .",
    "for such a time scale the length of the time series exceeds 40,000 data points . from the perspective of our present purpose this time scale and",
    "the corresponding length of the series turn out to constitute a reasonable compromise .",
    "thinking in terms of the epps effect  @xcite , in the liquid contemporary markets the time horizon of @xmath38 min is long enough so that the cross - correlations get sufficiently expressed beyond the noise level  @xcite . in case of the data considered here the time horizon at which @xmath39 saturates at its maximum corresponds to about 30 min , while for @xmath38 min @xmath39 assumes approx .",
    "2/3 of its saturation level .",
    "the length of the time series , on the other hand , allows one to study the @xmath4 dependence of cross - correlations in a relatively broad range of time intervals up to the maximum which corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "one natural characteristics that may offer some introductory insight when relating a given correlation matrix to the rmt is the distribution of matrix elements . for our correlation matrices",
    "two such distributions corresponding to the full @xmath40 and to @xmath41 , which in this latter case is obtained by properly windowing the same time series and averaging over the windows , versus the best gaussian fits , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "both these distributions are shifted more towards positive values . in the case of @xmath40",
    "the distribution is naturally much narrower than for @xmath41 and shows essentially no presence of negative matrix elements .",
    "this signals that the real correlations are less contaminated by the measurement noise for @xmath40 .",
    "also the gaussian fit in this case is less satisfactory , especially in the region of larger positive values of @xmath21 .",
    "here , on the level of @xmath42 probability one finds deviations of about @xmath43 ( mean standard deviation ) while for @xmath41 analogous deviations reach at most @xmath44 .",
    "a complementary and an even more informative characteristics of the matrix is its eigenvalue distribution . figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show all 100 eigenvalues distributed along the horizontal axis , denoted by vertical lines , for the above presented cases of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath39 , assuming very similar values ( @xmath45 ) , repelled from the rest of the spectrum , is seen in both cases and describes the collective eigenstate which can be identified with the market .",
    "the rest of the spectra develop however a significantly different structure . for @xmath41",
    "this rest covers a much wider range of values but at the same time its overlap with the corresponding random wishart matrices region ( shaded vertical ) , whose bounds are prescribed by the eq .",
    "( [ wishart ] ) , is very substantial ( @xmath46 ) while for @xmath40 it is rudimentary and looks pure coincidence .",
    "of course , concerning agreement of the empirical spectra with the rmt this case of @xmath40 is much more meaningful as compared to @xmath41 .",
    "one more interesting , and probably related effect , is that for @xmath40 one sees ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) the second @xmath47 , and even the third @xmath48 , eigenvalues that also are clearly separated from the bulk .",
    "these eigenvalues can be related to some branch - specific factors .",
    "no such factors can directly be seen for @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    due to the matrix trace conservation ( here @xmath49 ) , the existence of strong collective components can effectively supress the noisy part of the @xmath19 eigenspectrum , shifting smaller eigenvalues towards zero and thus may distort their relation to the rmt case . in order to correct for this effects , which more is affecting the case of figure 2(a )",
    ", it is recommended to remove the market factor @xmath50 from the data  @xcite .",
    "one way to do this is by means of the least square fitting of this factor represented by @xmath51 to each of the original stock signals @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are parameters , and then one can construct a new correlation matrix @xmath55 from the residuals @xmath56 ( e.g. ref .",
    "after this is performed significantly more eigenvalues for @xmath40 fall within the shaded rmt region as figure 2(c ) illustrates .",
    "for @xmath41 such a removal does not affect so much the bulk of the original spectrum as figure 2(d ) compared to 2(b ) shows .",
    "such a removal can be executed once again and the @xmath47 components can also be removed leading to the eigenspectra presented in figs 2(e ) and 2(f ) . the effect of this second removal is already much smaller but is more noticeable in the former case . in the corresponding figure 2(e )",
    "one still finds only ( @xmath57% ) eigenvalues overlapping with the rmt interval @xmath58 .",
    "this is almost a factor of two less than the case of @xmath41 in figure 2(f ) and only this latter result remains in agreement with results presented earlier in  @xcite ( based on the daily data but with similar small values of @xmath59 ) where a vast majority of the eigenvalues was within the rmt bounds .",
    "there is potentially one effect that may partly be responsible for such a sizeable disagreement between the @xmath40 empirical and the corresponding rmt results .",
    "there namely exists some time correlations - especially the volatility correlations - in the individual empirical time series that may effectively reduce the number of independent events in each series",
    ". if this is the case then the parameter @xmath59 used in the reference rmt formula should proportionally be smaller , the rmt bounds wider and thus an agreement improved . in order to verify to what extent such an effect may here be present we perform the following exercise .",
    "imagine all the time series are progressing along the independent circles each , such that the end of the series is connected to its starting point .",
    "the circles are then rotated against each other by a random angle .",
    "this procedure preserves the internal correlations within each series but destroys the cross - correlations .",
    "the spectrum of eigenvalues of the so - randomized empirical correlation matrix is shown in figure 3(a ) . the perfect coincidence between this empirical and the rmt result",
    "can be seen .",
    "this provides a strong evidence that the corresponding disagreement in figs .",
    "2 is entirely due to the real cross - correlations and is fully informative .    as another related test",
    "the above circles are randomly rotated but this time the rotation angles are restricted to the multiples of one full trading day ( daily rotated ) .",
    "now , as is shown in figure 3(b ) , the empirical spectrum broadens more than a factor of two relative to the previous case and of course by the same factor relative to the rmt bounds .",
    "this result may reflect the presence of day - to - day repeatable intraday patterns of activity that affect various different securities at similar instants of time during the day .    as a further examination of the character of the stock market cross - correlations two more types of artificial series based on the original empirical data",
    "are created using the decomposition as in eq .",
    "( [ svreturn ] ) . before the correlation matrix",
    "is calculated either ( a ) the signs ( @xmath60 ) are randomly reshuffled but the return magnitudes @xmath16 left at their original places or vice versa ( b ) , the signs are left original but @xmath16 reshuffled for each series independently .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure 4(a ) and 4(b ) correspondingly . from this perspective",
    "the signs turn out responsible much more for the cross - correlations than the corresponding magnitudes of the returns .",
    "as is clearly seen , randomizing signs washes out the cross - correlations almost completely ( though deviations relative to the rmt still remain ) while randomizing @xmath16 with the signs unaltered largely preserves the original ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) structure of the spectrum .",
    "to a good approximation the spectrum of fig .",
    "4(b ) looks compressed by a factor of about two relative to that in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    as a supplementary material to this kind of the test analysis in figure 5",
    "we show the spectra ( a ) of the correlations matrices calculated from the time series of @xmath60 and ( b ) from the time series of @xmath16 , independently . consistently with the observation made in figure 4(b ) the time series of the empirical return s signs show very similar structure of cross - correlations as the full original result ( figure 2(a ) ) . in view of the result presented in figure 4(a )",
    "somewhat surprising may however be considered the fact that the top eigenvalues appear ( figure 5(b ) ) even bit larger in the second case of @xmath16 time series .",
    "relevant here is that these volatility related cross - correlations manifest their presence only when the return s signs are entirely discarded , i.e. , their moduli are taken , which is a nonlinear operation .",
    "the correlation matrix detects the linear ( cross- ) correlations , but detecting linear correlations in volatility means detecting the nonlinear correlations in returns . thus the above results taken together also point to the complex nonlinear character of the financial cross - correlations .",
    "a deeper exploration of the relation between the characteristics of the empirical financial cross - correlations and those of the conventional rmt needs to involve also the eigensignals since they directly reflect the dynamics of the corresponding portfolio .",
    "figure 6 presents the time series of the eigensignal returns @xmath51 calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eigensignals ] ) for the most collective eigenstate associated with @xmath39 and for another one associated with @xmath61 .",
    "even though this latter case corresponds to the middle of the empirical spectrum , strongly overlapping with the rmt region , it appears difficult to detect any significant differences , if one compares both series visually , ignoring different scales in vertical axis .",
    "both eigensignals are nonstationary with likely extreme fluctuations and both of them also exhibit volatility clustering . a compact form to quantify the related effects is in terms of the multifractal spectra .",
    "it is a well established fact that stock returns form signals which are multifractal both on daily and on high - frequency time scales  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the singularity spectra @xmath62 we use the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa )  @xcite method which for the present purpose appears  @xcite more stable than the wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we start from our eigensignal @xmath63 represented by the time series @xmath64 of length @xmath65 and evaluate the signal profile @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes averaging over @xmath68 . in the next step @xmath69 is divided into @xmath70 segments of length @xmath23 ( @xmath71 ) starting from both the beginning and the end of the time series so that eventually there are @xmath72 segments . in each segment @xmath73 a local trend is removed by fitting an @xmath74-th order polynomial @xmath75 to the data . then , after calculating the variance @xmath76 - p_{\\nu}^{(l)}(k)\\}^2\\ ] ] and averaging it over @xmath73 s , we get the @xmath77th order fluctuation function @xmath78^{q/2}\\bigg\\}^{1/q } , \\ \\",

    "the fractal character @xmath79 obeys a power - law functional dependence on @xmath23 : @xmath80 at least for some range of @xmath23 .",
    "if this is the case the mf - dfa procedure provides a family of generalized hurst exponents @xmath81 , which form a decreasing function of @xmath77 for a multifractal signal or are independent of @xmath77 for a monofractal one .",
    "a compact form to present the result graphically is to calculate the singularity spectrum @xmath62 through the relations : @xmath82 + 1 .",

    "the maxima of these @xmath62 spectra are however located at different positions , even relative to @xmath84 , which may reflect either persistency or antipersistency in the underlying time series .",

    "the results presented in this contribution provide further evidence that the financial markets constitute a real complexity .",
