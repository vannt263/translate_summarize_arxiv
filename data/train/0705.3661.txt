    "one of the most dramatic manifestations of quantum mechanics observed in the last half - century is the casimir force : a tiny force on an uncharged , source - free body due to changes in the zero - point energy associated with quantum vacuum fluctuations ( virtual photons )  @xcite .",
    "there have been many experimental verifications of the casimir force reported in recent decades  @xcite , but always restricted to simple geometries ( parallel plates  @xcite , spheres and plates  @xcite , or crossed cylinders  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the force in these particular geometries is almost always attractive  @xcite ( except possibly for some unusual material systems  @xcite ) and monotonically decreasing with separation .",
    "thus , one might ask whether it is possible to obtain non - monotonic or even repulsive forces in more complex structures , and more generally whether complex geometries might give rise to unexpected force phenomena . for more complicated geometries , however ,",
    "calculations become extremely cumbersome and often require drastic approximations , a limitation that has hampered experimental and theoretical work beyond the standard geometries .    in this paper , we explore several ways in which well - established , efficient techniques from standard computational electromagnetism can be brought to bear on this problem , in order to predict forces for arbitrary geometries and materials with arbitrary accuracy ( no uncontrolled approximations ) .",
    "starting from the simplest , most direct approaches , we show that practical considerations naturally lead towards a particular method involving the integral of the minkowski stress tensor by repeated evaluation of the imaginary - frequency green s function  a method previously developed for purely analytical calculations  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the method by a simple finite - difference implementation , but evaluation of the green s function is so standard that many more sophisticated techniques are immediately applicable , and we discuss what techniques are likely to be optimal .",
    "our approach is tested for geometries with known solutions , and then is applied to new geometries in two and three dimensions that lead to surprising non - monotonic effects .",
    "we also demonstrate the application of our technique to dispersive dielectric materials , not just for idealized perfect metals .",
    "we explain how the same technique can be used for visualization of the casimir interactions between bodies , as well as for computing other quantities of interest , such as torques .",
    "the key advantage of exploiting standard computational approaches is not merely that existing code , error analyses , and other experience can be applied to the casimir problem , but also that these methods have been proven to scale to large three - dimensional problems , which have previously seemed out of reach of exact methods for the casimir force .    the most common approach to predicting",
    "the casimir force has been to consider approximations for small perturbations around known solutions , such as parallel plates or dilute gases .",
    "for parallel plates in @xmath0 dimensions , separated by a distance @xmath1 , there is a well - known attractive force that scales as @xmath2 , first predicted by casimir  @xcite and later extended to formulas for any planar - multilayer dielectric distribution @xmath3 via the generalized lifshitz formula  @xcite .",
    "a direct , intuitive extension of this result is the proximity force approximation ( pfa )  @xcite , which treats the force between two surfaces as a two - body interaction given by the sum of `` parallel plate '' contributions .",
    "valid in the limit of small curvature , pfa provides an easy way to conceptualize the casimir force in complex geometries as a simple two - body force law , but unfortunately it may also be deceptive : outside its range of applicability , the casimir force is not additive  @xcite and may be qualitatively different from pfa s predictions  @xcite .",
    "other perturbative approaches include renormalized casimir - polder  @xcite or semi - classical interactions  @xcite , multiple scattering expansions  @xcite , classical ray optics approximations  @xcite , higher - order pfa corrections  @xcite , and other perturbative techniques  @xcite .",
    "the ray - optics approach is especially interesting because , although it is only strictly valid in the small - curvature limit , it captures multiple - body interactions and can therefore sometimes predict the qualitative behavior in cases where other approximations fail  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , none of these methods provide any guarantees of accuracy in arbitrary geometries , where they involve uncontrolled approximations .",
    "therefore , for complex new geometries , where one might hope to encounter behaviors very different from those in the parallel - plate limit , a different approach is required .    to this end",
    ", researchers have sought `` exact '' numerical methods applicable to arbitrary geometries  that is , methods that converge to the exact result with arbitrary accuracy given sufficient computational resources .",
    "one such method was proposed by ref .  ,",
    "based on a path - integral representation for the effective action ; this method has predicted the force between a cylinder and a plate  @xcite , and between corrugated surfaces  @xcite .",
    "it is based on a surface parameterization of the fields coupled via vacuum green s functions , requiring @xmath4 storage and @xmath5 time for @xmath6 degrees of freedom , making scaling to three dimensions problematic .",
    "another exact method is the `` world - line approach ''  @xcite , based on monte - carlo path - integral calculations .",
    "the scaling of the world - line method involves a statistical analysis , determined by the relative feature sizes in the geometry , and is discussed below .",
    "the methods of ref .   and ref .",
    "have currently only been demonstrated for perfect - metallic @xmath7-invariant structures  in this case",
    ", the vector unknowns can be decomposed into te ( @xmath8 ) and tm ( @xmath9 ) scalar fields with neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively  although generalizations have been proposed  @xcite . here ,",
    "we propose a method based on evaluation of the mean minkowski stress tensor via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which only involves repeated evaluation of the electromagnetic imaginary - frequency green s function . for our initial volume discretization with @xmath6 degrees of freedom and an efficient iterative solver ,",
    "this requires @xmath10 storage and at best @xmath11 time in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "furthermore , because evaluation of the green s function is such a standard problem in classical computational electromagnetism , it will be possible to exploit many developments in fast solvers , based on finite - element  @xcite , spectral  @xcite , or boundary - element methods  @xcite . as we argue below",
    ", a future implementation using boundary - element methods should attain nearly @xmath12 time . to illustrate the method , however , our initial implementation is based on the much simpler finite - difference frequency - domain method  @xcite with a conjugate - gradient solver  @xcite , as described below .    in the following sections , we describe the step - by - step conceptual development of our computational method .",
    "our purpose here is to start back at the beginning , with the earliest theoretical descriptions of the casimir force , and analyze these formulations from the point of view of their suitability for purely numerical calculations .",
    "although the final technique , in terms of the stress tensor integrated over space and imaginary frequency , can be viewed as a numerical implementation of a textbook result due to dzyaloshinski _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is illustrative to derive it as the culmination of a sequence of simpler approaches , in order to show how it circumvents a number of numerical obstacles that would hinder a more direct method . to begin with , we illustrate the methods using the well - known case of parallel plates where they can be compared to analytical expressions , but a more rigorous test is subsequently provided by the situation of a cylinder and plate , recently solved numerically  @xcite . finally , we apply our method to a new geometry of a `` piston''-like structure involving blocks sliding between parallel walls , in both two and three dimensions with both perfect metals and more realistic dispersive dielectrics , and demonstrate a surprising non - monotonic `` lateral '' effect from the walls .",
    "we conclude by analyzing the scaling of the method compared to previous approaches and discussing the application of more sophisticated finite - element and boundary - element techniques .",
    "perhaps the simplest approach to computing the casimir force is to think of it as the derivative of the zero - point energy @xmath13 expressed as a sum of ground - state photon energies @xmath14 . for each photon mode with frequency @xmath15 ,",
    "the zero - point energy is @xmath16 , and thus the total casimir energy , at least for non - dissipative systems where @xmath15 is real  @xcite , is formally given by the sum over all modes  @xcite : @xmath17 this sum is formally infinite , because the classical harmonic modes @xmath15 have unbounded frequencies .",
    "there is some controversy over the physical interpretation of this divergence  @xcite , but in practice it is removed by regularizing the sum in some fashion , for example multiplying by @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and taking @xmath20 only _ after _ the sum is differentiated to obtain the force @xmath21 between two bodies with separation @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this approach , which was an early method to analytically compute the force between perfect - metal plates  @xcite , might seem to provide the most direct computational method as well .",
    "after all , the computation of electromagnetic eigenmodes is routine even in very complicated geometries , and efficient methods are known  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out not to be practical for this problem ( except in one - dimensional geometries  @xcite ) , as explained below , but the _ reason _ why it is impractical points the way to more efficient methods .    to illustrate the difficulty in directly evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , let us consider the simplest one - dimensional geometry : two parallel perfect - metal plates , separated by a distance @xmath1 , in which case one can predict analytically an attractive force @xmath22  @xcite . ignoring this analytical result ,",
    "let us apply a numerical method that , conceptually , we could apply to an arbitrary geometry :    1 .",
    "discretize space with resolution @xmath23 using a finite - difference approximation , with space truncated to a finite computational cell ( e.g. with periodic boundaries ) .",
    "2 .   solve numerically for the eigenmode frequencies @xmath15 and sum to obtain @xmath24 .",
    "3 .   shift one body ( one plate ) by one pixel @xmath23 and thus compute @xmath25 .",
    "4 .   obtain the force @xmath26 / \\delta x$ ] .",
    "note that this method automatically provides its own regularization : the number of modes @xmath15 in a discretized computational cell is finite ( the frequencies are bounded by the nyquist limit ) , and hence @xmath13 is finite for @xmath27 .",
    "the periodic boundaries will lead to artificial `` wrap - around '' forces , but since casimir forces decay rapidly with distance , the contribution of these forces can be made negligible for a sufficiently large computational cell .",
    ", embedded in a computational cell of length @xmath28 , with periodic boundary conditions , and resolution @xmath23.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this method , for the one - dimensional parallel - plate geometry , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - model ] . here , we have two plates with separation @xmath1 and an overall computational cell size @xmath29 ( which will contribute an erroneous wrap - around force 1/16 of the physical force ) .",
    "maxwell s equations , in one dimension , can be written as the scalar eigenproblem @xmath30 ( in @xmath31 units ) , which is discretized to @xmath32 in a center - difference approximation for @xmath33 . for two metal plates with separation @xmath0 and dirichlet boundary condition @xmath34",
    ", the discrete eigenvalues @xmath35 can be found analytically : @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the energy @xmath13 is then given by summing @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the force @xmath40 by the discrete derivative of @xmath13 as above .    applying this procedure numerically for @xmath41 ,",
    "one obtains the correct force to within 5% ( and to any desired accuracy by increasing @xmath42 and decreasing @xmath23 ) , so at first glance it may seem that the method is successful",
    ". however , its impracticality is revealed if we examine the contribution of each frequency @xmath35 to the force .     vs. @xmath15 for 1d parallel metal plates from fig .",

    "[ fig : fdensity ] shows the contribution @xmath44 [ @xmath45 to the force summation , and the bottom panel shows the corresponding partial sum ( for frequencies up to @xmath15 ) .",
    "we see that _ every _ frequency ( of the regularized / finite - resolution problem ) makes a non - negligible contribution to the force , and the summation is of a wildly oscillating quantity that leaves a tiny remainder at the end .",
    "the reason for these oscillations is quite simple : as @xmath1 is increased , the frequencies on the @xmath46 side of the plates increase slowly , while the smaller number of frequencies on the @xmath1 side of the plate decrease more rapidly , and these lead to the positive and negative contributions in the top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fdensity ] , respectively .",
    "these two features , which are intrinsic properties not limited to this particular discretized geometry  @xcite , combine to make this method impractical in higher - dimensional structures . because _",
    "every _ frequency contributes to the force , in a numerical method one must compute every eigenvalue of the maxwell eigenproblem . in one dimension ,",
    "that is not so bad , but in general if there are @xmath6 degrees of freedom ( @xmath6 grid points ) , then computing every eigenvalue of an @xmath47 matrix requires @xmath4 storage and @xmath5 time .",
    "this is impractical in three dimensions where @xmath6 may be in the millions .",
    "furthermore , the wild oscillations of the summand imply that the eigenvalues must be computed quite accurately , and may exacerbate numerical difficulties in larger problems .    however , these undesirable features are avoidable , because we have not yet exploited a key property of maxwell s equations : causality .",
    "if we ignore the causality constraint , then the oscillatory spectrum would be an observable effect : one would simply employ a material that is a perfect metal in some frequency range and transparent otherwise , in order to obtain the force spectrum integrated only in that range .",
    "such a material , however , would violate the kramers - kronig constraints that follow from causality considerations  @xcite . thus , we are motivated to exploit causality in some fashion to avoid the oscillatory spectrum .",
    "in order to exploit causality , we will rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) in terms of the electromagnetic green s function via an integral over the density of states .",
    "causality implies that the green s function has no poles in the upper - half plane , so one can perform a contour integration , or _ wick rotation _ , to transform the sum over real frequencies into an integral along the imaginary - frequency axis .",
    "the result of this standard trick turns out to be a well - known expression : an integral of the mean electromagnetic energy density , evaluated by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem using the temperature ( matsubara ) green s function .",
    "again , we focus on the method s suitability as a purely _ numerical _ approach , for arbitrary geometries , and we will find that it still leaves something to be desired .",
    "first , we can express the zero - point energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) as an integral over the local density of states @xmath48 : @xmath49 since we are solving for the eigenstates of maxwell s equations @xmath50 , the local density of states @xmath51 can be expressed in terms of the green s tensor @xmath52  @xcite :    @xmath53    where @xmath52 solves : @xmath54 , with @xmath55 denoting the unit vector in the @xmath56th direction . for non - dissipative systems",
    "in which eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) is valid , @xmath57 is real and we can therefore pull the @xmath58 outside of the integral .",
    "( the generalization to dissipative materials is discussed below . )",
    "furthermore , we know from causality requirements that the green s function has no poles in the upper half plane in @xmath15-space  @xcite .",
    "this means that one can perform a contour integration to relate @xmath59 to the integral @xmath60 along the imaginary - frequency axis @xmath61 , also known as a wick rotation .",

    "( [ eq : uimag ] ) .    from a computational perspective , the imaginary - frequency integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uimag ] ) turns out to be greatly superior to the real - frequency summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , for two reasons .",
    "first , while every real frequency @xmath15 contributed to the force @xmath70 , the same is not true for the derivative of the imaginary - frequency integrand . in particular , as discussed below , the force integrand in imaginary frequencies turns out to be a smooth , non - oscillatory , strongly peaked function of @xmath71 , meaning that one can integrate it via a smooth - quadrature method that evaluates the integrand at only a small number of @xmath71 values .",
    "second , the imaginary - frequency green s function turns out to be quite easy to obtain by relatively standard methods , including for dissipative systems ( where obtaining the eigenmodes is harder because it involves a non - hermitian eigenproblem ) .",
    "these two favorable features are closely related .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) for the imaginary - frequency green s function . unlike its real - frequency counterpart ,",
    "the linear operator on the left - hand side of this equation is _ real - symmetric _ and _ positive - definite _ ( for @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is true even for dissipative materials where @xmath73 is complex , since causality requirements imply that @xmath74 is purely real and positive ( in the absence of gain )  @xcite .",
    "for one thing , this implies that the most powerful numerical methods are applicable to solving the linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : green])many of these methods ( e.g. the conjugate - gradient method ) are restricted to hermitian positive - definite operators  @xcite .",
    "also , the resulting green s function is particularly well - behaved : it is exponentially decaying and non - oscillatory .",
    "this transforms the highly oscillatory real-@xmath15 force integrand into a mostly non - oscillatory integrand , and also makes the force integrand exponentially decaying for large @xmath71 ( for large @xmath71 , the interactions between bodies become exponentially small ) .",
    "( in addition , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : beyond - fdfd ] , the exponentially decaying green s function is especially favorable for boundary - element numerical methods . )    again , considering the simplest possible finite - difference scheme , this leads us to the following numerical algorithm to compute the force :    1 .   for a given imaginary frequency @xmath71 : 1 .   for every grid point",
    "@xmath75 , solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) for each polarization @xmath56 to obtain @xmath76 .",
    "2 .   sum over @xmath75 to compute the spatial integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uimag ] ) .",
    "3 .   repeat the above for the body shifted by one pixel @xmath23 and subtract to obtain the force integrand at @xmath71 .",
    "2 .   employ a smooth quadrature scheme to integrate the above function over @xmath71 to obtain the force .",
    "again , the spatial discretization provides its own regularization ( @xmath77 is finite ) , and thus no additional regularization is required ( the contribution of the vacuum green s function to the net force is zero ) .",
    "again , one can truncate the computational cell in a number of ways , for example with periodic boundaries , and the artifacts thereby introduced will decrease rapidly with cell size .",
    "again , there are also many other ways that one could potentially solve for @xmath77 besides a finite - difference approximation , but we will delay discussion of those techniques until we have formulated the final method in the next section .     between two 1d parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath78 versus imaginary frequency @xmath79 , using the method of sec .  [",
    "sec : energy].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the above procedure can again be applied to the one - dimensional problem of the force between two plates , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdensity ] , to illustrate its basic features .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psum - casimit ] , plotting the force integrand as a function of imaginary frequency @xmath71 , and the difference from fig .",
    "[ fig : fdensity ] is striking .",
    "the integrated force is the same ( correct ) result as before . unlike fig .",
    "[ fig : fdensity ] , the force integrand has no sign oscillations , is exponentially decaying for large @xmath71 , and is strongly peaked around a characteristic @xmath80 , corresponding to a `` wavelength '' of @xmath1 ( the separation ) .",
    "these features imply that the force can be accurately integrated by an adaptive gauss - kronrod quadrature scheme  @xcite using at most a few dozen @xmath71 points .",
    "although this method is much more efficient than the one described in the previous section , and is potentially practical at least in two dimensions , it still has some undesirable features .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath6 grid points in our discretized operator ( @xmath6 may be very large in 3d ) . even if we have an ideal iterative solver for the sparse linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) , such as an ideal multigrid solver  @xcite , each evaluation of the green s function takes at best @xmath10 time with @xmath10 storage .",
    "however , we must evaluate the green s function @xmath81 times in order to perform the spatial integration , resulting in @xmath4 complexity .",
    "as is discussed in the next section , one can do much better than this by using the _ stress tensor _ instead of the energy density .",
    "in fact , as is discussed in sec .  [ sec : beyond - fdfd ] , it should ultimately be possible to obtain the force with nearly @xmath12 work using a boundary - element method to compute the stress tensor , in which @xmath6 is only the number of degrees of freedom required to represent the _ interfaces _ between materials .",
    "after having analyzed the feasibility of several techniques to solve the casimir problem through the lens of numerical electromagnetism , we are ready to appreciate and explore the most feasible of the methods thus far presented : an approach based on the maxwell stress tensor .    as derived by dzyaloshinski  _ et al .",

    "first , in framing the problem in terms of the stress tensor , we have reduced the spatial integral over the whole volume ( eq .  ( [ eq : uenergy ] ) ) to a surface integral around the body of interest .",
    "this implies that , for a @xmath0-dimensional geometry , the computational effort due to spatial integration is reduced from @xmath4 to @xmath11 .",
    "second , the force is now given _ directly _ in terms of the dyadic green s function ( via the stress tensor ) , rather than its derivative , which avoids another layer of computation .",
    "moreover , although our derivation is only valid when the stress tensor is evaluated at points within lossless dielectrics ( regardless of whether the bodies themselves are dissipative ) , one can also extend it for evaluation in absorbing media  @xcite .",
    "however , the case discussed above ( bodies separated by vacuum ) is the most common .",
    "so far , we have presented the step - by - step development of an efficient approach to computing casimir forces . in what follows",
    ", we illustrate our new approach using a proof - of - concept finite - difference implementation , and present results that demonstrate its flexibility and utility .",
    "at this point , all that remains is the numerical computation of the green s function via eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) for an imaginary frequency @xmath61 .",
    "this is simply the inversion of a linear operator @xmath97 $ ] that has the convenient properties of being real - symmetric and positive - definite , as stated above .",

    "the key advantage of fdfd is its flexibility : with very little effort , we were able to implement support for arbitrary geometric shapes and arbitrary materials ( both perfect metals and dispersive / dissipative dielectrics ) .    again choosing the simplest possible approach",
    ", we apply periodic boundary conditions at the edges of the computational cell , which are accurate as long as the boundaries are sufficiently far compared to the separation between the interacting bodies .",

    "although this scheme does not require any additional regularization ( the integrand is finite for a finite resolution , and the integral of the vacuum stress tensor over the contour is zero ) , we have found that numerical convergence can be accelerated by subtracting the stress - tensor integral over the isolated bodies .",

    "third , the stress - tensor integrand is a discretized , non - smooth function of space , meaning that we must evaluate it at a number of grid points proportional to the resolution ( or resolution squared , in three dimensions ) ; in general , the integrand must therefore be evaluated @xmath174 times for a @xmath175 dimensional surface in @xmath0 dimensions , leading to at best @xmath11 complexity . to address these drawbacks ,",

    "finite - element methods can employ a non - uniform volume discretization , via an unstructured mesh , that can both put more resolution where it is needed and conform to the material interfaces to obtain higher - order accuracy  @xcite .",
    "however , from the perspective of casimir - force calculations , finite - element methods seem to have two potential drawbacks . first , because space is still discretized , the stress tensor is again not a smooth function of space and its accurate integration requires that the green s function be evaluated at many mesh points .",
    "second , there may be a problem with regularization : although the green s function does not diverge in discretized space , with a non - uniform resolution this effective regularization varies at different points .",
    "unless there is a way to locally regularize the problem ( subtracting a vacuum green s function computed at the local spatial resolution ) , this may lead to unphysical , non - convergent forces .",
    "boundary - element methods ( bems ) involve a discretization in terms of unknowns only at the interfaces between different materials ",
    "these surface unknowns are coupled to one another via the ( known ) green s functions of the homogeneous regions  @xcite .",
    "they are thus ideal for open problems , in which the bodies are surrounded by infinite volumes of empty space , since those infinite regions are treated analytically . using the fast - multipole method ( fmm ) or other fast integral - equation methods  @xcite , bems can solve for the surface unknowns , and hence the green s function , in @xmath12 time for @xmath6 discretized unknowns , multiplied by a number of iterations ( @xmath176 ) that depends on the condition number of the matrix and the preconditioning  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bems have two unique advantages when applied to the problem of casimir forces .",
    "first , the regularization can be performed analytically : since bems express the green s function as the sum of the vacuum green s function plus a set of contributions from surface currents , the vacuum green s function can be trivially subtracted analytically .",
    "second , because space is not discretized , the stress tensor in a bem will be a _",
    "smooth _ ( infinitely differentiable ) function of space  this means that the spatial integral can be performed with exponentially - convergent smooth quadrature methods .",
    "therefore , the number of times that the green s function must be computed is determined only by the convergence of the smooth multidimensional quadrature in @xmath177 dimensions ( space + frequency ) , _ independent _ of @xmath6 .    for these reasons , we suspect that bems will lead to the most efficient methods to compute casimir forces for complicated structures in three dimensions .",
    "moreover , all that needs to be done is to take an existing bem green s function solver and change it to solve for the imaginary-@xmath15 green s function . because the imaginary-@xmath15 green s functions are exponentially decaying ( and approach the familiar poisson kernel as @xmath178 ) , such a fast solver should actually be simpler than the corresponding real-@xmath15 solver , nor are the singularities in the green s function any worse . and ,",
    "as mentioned previously , the resulting matrix equation is real - symmetric and positive - definite for imaginary @xmath15 , unlike the real-@xmath15 case , even for dissipative materials .",
    "in short , there do not appear to be any substantial unsolved algorithmic problems involved in implementing a bem for casimir forces .",
    "in this section , we briefly compare the stress - tensor approach with other known exact numerical methods applicable to arbitrary geometries , focusing mostly on the computational aspects .",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "emig s method , applicable to both separable and non - separable geometries and not limited to perfect metallic structures ( although currently only demonstrated in perfect metallic separable geometries ) , involves a surface parameterization of the green s function .",

    "( [ eq : energy - dos ] ) .",
    "however , the crucial aspect of this method lies in the evaluation of the dos , given by  @xcite : @xmath181 here @xmath182 is an @xmath183 dense matrix , where @xmath6 is the number of surface degrees of freedom , whose entries are in terms of the imaginary-@xmath15 vacuum green s function @xmath184 evaluated on the surface of each body .",

    "we should comment however , that emig s method is closely related to a boundary - element method ( bem ) as discussed in the previous section .",
    "bems also involve parameterization in terms of surface degrees of freedom , which are also coupled in terms of vacuum green s functions , leading to a dense matrix which must be inverted to compute the inhomogeneous green s function . by recognizing this relationship",

    "this does not include the @xmath203 factors , although it seems likely that @xmath198 is at least @xmath204 ( so that the spatial resolutions are comparable ) , in which case the time scaling would be at least @xmath205 . in comparison , a bem for the same geometry ( exploiting the cylindrical symmetry to reduce it to a 2d problem similar to ref .  )",
    "should require degrees of freedom @xmath6 that never scale worse than linearly with the relevant lengthscale , and time that scales with @xmath206 rather than @xmath207 .",
    "a general comparison seems difficult , however , and a detailed statistical study is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the general considerations involved in designing a purely computational method are often quite different from those involved in designing an analytical method .",
    "for this reason , we believe it is most fruitful to start back at the earliest possible formulations and proceed using the new computational perspective , rather than attempting to add more and more corrections to analytical methods for specific geometries .",
    "moreover , since decades of research have gone into the development of numerical methods for classical electromagnetism , culminating in methods applicable to complicated inhomogeneous three - dimensional geometries , it is desirable to seek approaches for the casimir force that exploit these developments .",
    "we believe that the stress - tensor approach , developed for analytical calculations several decades ago , provides the ideal formulation for a computational approach exploiting standard numerical techniques .    in the future",
    ", we would like to employ the stress - tensor approach to study casimir forces and torques in more realistic and/or more unusual structures .",
    "the large and growing number of interesting applications of the casimir effect and the ongoing experimental work on non - standard geometries  @xcite provide an environment in which the generality and strengths of the stress - tensor method could be exploited .",
    "in addition , we are currently implementing more efficient boundary - element versions of our approach in three dimensions .",
    "we would also like to investigate related computational problems .",
    "one immediate possibility is to compute the net _ torque _ on a body , instead of the net force .",
    "classically , given the stress tensor @xmath95 , one can compute the torque by integrating @xmath208  @xcite .",
    "this has been exploited by several authors to compute classical electromagnetic torques  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the casimir torque can be obtained by using the mean @xmath209 from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , just as for the net force  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can compute torques by almost the same method as above , via repeated evaluations of the classical green s function .",
    "several authors have computed casimir torques in parallel - plate and perfect - metallic wedge geometries  @xcite ; other interesting structures include the casimir `` pendulum ''  @xcite as well as corrugated surfaces  @xcite , although these two structures have only been evaluated by methods with uncontrolled approximations .",

    "in what follows , we derive the force per unit length in translation - invariant structures in terms of an integral over the solutions of bloch - periodic problems .",
    "this is not a new idea , but an explicit general derivation starting from the spatial integral of the stress tensor , including the case of finite periodicity , seems difficult to find in the literature . as given above by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flength ] ) , the force per unit length can be written as : @xmath210 for a periodic structure in the @xmath7-direction with period @xmath102 , and size @xmath107 with periodic boundary conditions ( ultimately , we will take the limit as @xmath211 ) .",
    "as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stress ] ) , the stress tensor is expressed via the green s function , and therefore eq .  ( [ eq : app - tensor ] )",
    "can be decomposed into individual terms of the form : @xmath212 where @xmath213 and the green s function is given as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) by the solution of : @xmath214 in which @xmath215 denotes the linear operator @xmath216 . in the following",
    ", we will focus on the periodic @xmath7 direction and leave the @xmath163 and @xmath217 coordinates implicit for simplicity .",
    "that is , we will write e.g. @xmath218 instead of @xmath219 .    at this point , we can re - express the delta function over the periodic direction @xmath7 in terms of the fourier identity : @xmath220 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - f ] ) , we will move the @xmath221 outside the @xmath222 and consider the action of @xmath223 on the remaining summation : @xmath224 where we have used the periodic boundary conditions in @xmath42 to realize that @xmath225 is a cyclic shift of @xmath226 with a phase factor .",
    "now , we must operate @xmath223 on @xmath227 and evaluate at @xmath228",
    ". however , this corresponds to finding the field from a bloch - periodic current source , and such a field is also bloch - periodic .",
    "therefore : @xmath229 at this point , we have completely eliminated the @xmath116-dependence from the evaluation of the green s function @xmath230 , and the phase factors from eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - j ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - green - periodic ] ) cancel .",
    "the remaining summation @xmath222 simply yields @xmath6 , which cancels the @xmath231 factor from eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - delta - sum ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : app - f ] ) therefore becomes : @xmath232 where @xmath233 , the field from a bloch - periodic sum of delta - function sources .",
    "finally , we can now take the limit @xmath234 by turning @xmath221 into an integral : @xmath235 where @xmath119 is the bloch wavevector ( @xmath236 ) .",
