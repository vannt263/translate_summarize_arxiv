    "the concepts of quantum interference , correlations and entanglement are at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "a quantum interference between two parts a system s evolution is prevented when the system interacts with another so as to produce an entangled state . in such situations ,",
    "properties of the two entangled systems are correlated , and correlations of this type are subject to the bell inequalities ( bell 1964 ) , which shows that they are non - local in character .",
    "whereas for many quantum mechanical effects a model can be given which relies only on classical concepts , this non - locality is a feature of quantum mechanics which is alien to the very structure of other ( classical ) theories .",
    "( many texts are available as an introduction to this broad subject , for example that of shimony 1989 . )",
    "one way of shedding light on the nature of quantum mechanics is to pose the question `` to what extent can quantum mechanical behaviour be modelled in classical terms ? '' to make this slightly vague question more concrete , it can be posed thus : `` to what extent can quantum mechanical behaviour be simulated by means of a universal computer operating according to the laws of classical mechanics ? ''",
    "such a ` universal ' computer is universal in the sense of a universal turing machine : it can simulate the behaviour of any other computer in the set of all possible computers ( turing 1936 ) . however , as long as the set of ` possible ' computers includes only those operating by classical laws of physics , then the non - local correlations which arise in the real world can not be simulated , as was discussed by feynman 1982 . to simulate them ,",
    "the computer must be allowed to operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "hence one introduces the concept of the quantum , as opposed to classical , computer ( see deutsch 1985 ; ekert 1995 ) , and the question under consideration can be re - phrased : `` to what extent can a quantum computer perform calculations which are beyond the computing abilities of a classical computer ? '' for the physicist , this question addresses fundamental questions concerning the nature of our most basic physical theory .",
    "however , the answer is also of considerable practical interest because computing ability is an extremely useful kind of ability .",
    "the theoretical analysis of quantum computers has by now passed some important milestones , among them the demonstration of how to construct a universal quantum computer ( deutsch 1985 ) , the discovery of simple universal quantum gates ( deutsch _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , barenco 1995 , divincenzo 1995 ) , and the presentation of algorithms for idealised quantum computers which surpass the computing ability of known algorithms for classical computers , and which appear to surpass even what is in principle possible classically ( deutsch & jozsa 1992 , bernstein 1993 , shor 1994 , simon 1994 ) .",
    "it has been obvious from the outset that quantum computation is different from classical computation precisely because of the possibility of quantum interference and entanglement . however , this entanglement is itself sensitive to a problem which is unavoidable in the quantum context , namely , _ decoherence _ of the state of the computer ( zurek 1993 , landauer 1995 ) .",
    "the useful algorithms just mentioned were initialy proposed under the assumption of the idealised case that this decoherence , or generally any process involving loss of quantum information , is negligible .",
    "however , it can be argued that the possibility of decoherence is itself just as fundamental a feature of quantum mechanics as the interference and entanglement of which a quantum computer takes advantage .",
    "such decoherence must be considered , for example , in any discussion of the  schrdinger s cat \" paradox ( schrdinger 1935 ; for a text - book treatment see , for example , peres 1993 ) .",
    "the cat in schrdinger s thought - experiment corresponds here to the quantum computer itself .",
    "hence , the idealisation in which decoherence is taken to be negligible is not merely a limit on the practical application of the theory of quantum computation , it is in fact an `` idealisation too far '' , since it involves neglecting a basic aspect of quantum theory , as has been emphasized by landauer 1995 .",
    "this paper discusses both the nature of quantum interference involving many particles , and also the question of decoherence in quantum computers .",
    "it is shown that both questions are intimately concerned with the issue of error correction which arises in classical information theory .",
    "unruh 1995 and palma  _ et al . _",
    "1996 calculated the sensitivity of a ` bare ' quantum computer to thermal decoherence . here",
    ", we are concerned with the different question of how to add redundancy to such a ` bare ' computer in order to stabilise it against all error processes , including decoherence .",
    "the classical theory of error correction which is invoked is a well - founded body of knowledge involving some beautiful mathematical concepts , and we can take advantage of this knowledge in our quest to understand quantum mechanics more fully . this paper does not assume much familiarity with classical error correction , however . at the risk of alienating experts , concepts from classical information theory are introduced for the most part with sufficient explanation to allow readers unfamiliar with this material to follow the argument .",
    "the readily available textbooks such as macwilliams & sloane 1977 and hamming 1986 give further explanation .    in section [ sec : mpi ] a general theory of interference involving many particles",
    "is presented .",
    "it is shown that an interesting class of entanglements involving many particles ( or other simple quantum systems ) can be understood by appealing to the known theory of classical error correcting codes . in section [ sec : ecq ] the same concepts are applied to the problem of error correction in a set of two - state systems ( ` quantum bits ' ) .",
    "coding and correction methods are presented which allow the problem of decoherence in a quantum computer to be circumvented .",
    "the same methods allow privacy in quantum cryptography to be enhanced ( for a review and references to this subject , see , for example , hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 and phoenix and townsend 1995 . ) in section [ sec : errlim ] the limitations of these coding methods are estimated , by a calculation reminiscent of shannon s main theorem for communication through a noisy channel . a full quantum equivalent to shannon",
    "s theorem is not found , and this is a limitation of the present work , but the ideas presented here suggest ways of tackling this more general question .",
    "the conclusions of the present discussion are hopeful , however , in that they suggest that error - free quantum computation is possible using resources ( numbers of quantum bits and of operations ) that are only a polynomial factor greater than those required by an ideal quantum computer .",
    "indeed , the judicious use of redundency and error correction allows the probability of decoherence to _ fall exponentially _ with the amount of redundency .",
    "this is a conclusion which has commonly been imagined to be ruled out for quantum systems .",
    "the implementation of the error correction procedure to be described , without introducing excessive extra decoherence , remains a severe technological challenge , however .",
    "consider a two - state quantum system .",
    "its two - dimensional hilbert space is spanned by two orthogonal states which will be written @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these states may for example be different states of motion of a spinless particle of no internal structure , or they may be different internal states , such as those of a two - level atom .",
    "the simple concept of quantum interference arises when such a system is in a state such as @xmath8 , and measurements are performed which project the state onto @xmath9 .",
    "now , what happens if this system interacts with another two - state system , such that the total state of the pair is the entangled state @xmath10 ? in this case , measurements on either subsystem alone ( hereafter called a ` particle ' ) will not reveal any interference effect ( any dependence on the value of @xmath11 ) .",
    "if both particles are measured in the @xmath9 basis , on the other hand , and _ the results of the measurements on each particle pair are compared _ , then a correlation is observed which is sensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "the probability that the particles are found in the same state is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "whereas before we had a single particle interference effect , we now have a _ two - particle interference _ , in the sense that no measurements on individual particles reveal the interference phase @xmath11 , while combining measurements on both particles makes the interference ` fringe ' @xmath13 observable .",
    "the above argument was extended by greenberger _",
    "_ 1990 , so that one speaks of an `` @xmath2-particle interference , '' meaning a state of @xmath2 particles in which _ no _ measurements on _ any _ subset of the @xmath2 particles ( containing 1 , 2 or any number up to @xmath14 particles ) will suffise to reveal an interference , but once all @xmath2 are measured ( in the correct basis ) , and correlations established between the results , the interference becomes apparent .",
    "such an @xmath2-particle interference is the state @xmath15 where there are @xmath2 zeroes or ones in the ket labels , and the usual convention has been followed of writing product states ( @xmath16 ) by the notation @xmath17 . when @xmath18 the correlations are subject to the most simple type of bell inequality .",
    "when @xmath19 we have the ` ghz ' state of greenberger , horne and zeilinger 1989 , in which correlations can be found which are both non - local and which occur with certainty . also , zurek 1981 stressed that three particles are sufficient and necessary to establish a ` preferred ' basis for inter - particle correlations . for larger",
    "@xmath2 , mermin 1990 derived a bell - type inequality which becomes more and more severe as @xmath2 grows .",
    "is there a simple way of seeing that the state @xmath20 is an @xmath2-particle interference ?",
    "clearly , a ` which path ' argument will suffice .",
    "if any set of less than @xmath2 particles is measured , the remaining unmeasured two - state system could in principle be measured in the @xmath21 basis , thus indicating which of the two ` paths ' @xmath22 or @xmath23 the whole system followed , which prevents any interference between those paths .    in the case",
    "that all @xmath2 particles are measured so as to observe a @xmath11-dependent result , it is instructive to examine how such interference can come about , it being a property of all @xmath2 particles , and not of any subset . to this end , a simple notation will be introduced .",
    "the pair of states @xmath24 will be referred to as ` basis  1 ' , and written using standard ( unbarred ) labels .",
    "the states @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , will be referred to as ` basis  2 ' , and distinguished from basis 1 by using bars over the ket symbols .",
    "( the two bases are related by a rotation in hilbert space through 45 degrees ) .",
    "consider the three - particle interference @xmath27 . to observe the interference ,",
    "measurements must be carried out in basis 2 on all the particles .",
    "therefore , it is useful to write the state @xmath28 in terms of basis states of basis 2 : @xmath29 measurements carried out in basis 2 will collapse the state onto one of the 8 product states @xmath30 , @xmath31 . examining equation ( [ 3phi ] )",
    ", one finds that _ the probability of obtaining an even number of 1 s _ is equal to @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the information on the value of @xmath11 is contained in the _ parity check _ of the total state in basis 2 .",
    "we are using the word ` parity ' in the sense of the parity check for binary communication channels .    with this insight in terms of parity ,",
    "a new way of explaining the @xmath2-particle inteference arises . for , to learn the parity of a string of @xmath2 bits , it is obvious that one must know the value of all @xmath2 bits .",
    "no subset of the bits contains this information .",
    "it is important to note that when @xmath32 , _ all _ the 4 possible product states of even parity appear , and when @xmath33 , all the 4 possible product states of odd parity appear .",
    "if this were not the case , then sometimes a subset containing less than 3 bits would define the parity .",
    "for example , if we know from the outset that the product state @xmath34 is not present in the final superposition , then whenever measurements of the first two bits both yield @xmath35 , we know immediately that the overall parity is even , without measuring the third bit .",
    "the parity check argument is true for any @xmath2 ( this was shown by steane 1996a and will also be demonstrated below ) . the parity check is a two - valued quantity , and thus can store a single bit of information .",
    "it may be imagined as a single bit stored symetrically among all the @xmath2 bits .",
    "once the @xmath2-particle interference has been understood as a parity check in basis 2 , the concept of multiple - particle interference can be generalised . for",
    ", an overall parity check is the simplest example of _ error detection _ in a classical communication channel .",
    "more advanced types of error detection and correction are associated with more complicated types of @xmath2-particle interferences . to understand the details ,",
    "we make use of theorems 1 to 3 of steane 1996a , which are reproduced below .",
    "before they are presented , a few notations will be introduced .",
    "first , the two - state systems which have so far been referred to as ` particles ' will hereafter be called qubits . the product states in either of bases 1 or 2 ( e.g. @xmath36 or @xmath37 )",
    "will be referred to as _ words _ , since each such state is identified by a unique string of bits when written in the relevent basis .",
    "a superposition of product states defines a set of words .",
    "a set of words is called a _ code _ , following standard nomenclature in the theory of error correcting codes . when writing superposition ( entangled )",
    "states , the overall normalisation factor will often be omitted , since it is not important to the main argument , and can always be reintroduced easily if necessary .",
    "the theorems derived in steane 1996a are as follows",
    ".    * theorem 1 .",
    "* _ the word @xmath38 consisting of all zeroes in basis @xmath35 is equal to a superposition of all @xmath39 possible words in basis @xmath40 , with equal coefficients . _",
    "* theorem 2 . *",
    "_ if the @xmath41th bit of each word is complemented @xmath42 in basis @xmath35 , then all words in basis @xmath40 in which the @xmath41th bit is set ( is a @xmath43 ) change sign .",
    "_    * theorem 3 . *",
    "_ when the quantum state of the system forms a linear code @xmath44 in basis @xmath35 , in a superposition with equal coefficients , then in basis @xmath40 the words appearing in the superposition are those of the dual code @xmath45 .",
    "_    theorems 1 and 2 are easy to prove , while theorem 3 requires further comment .",
    "a _ linear _ code @xmath44 is any set of @xmath2-bit words for which if the bitwise exclusive - or ( addition modulo 2 ) operation @xmath46 is carried out between any two words in the code , then the resulting word is also in the code .",
    "such codes can be expressed in terms of an @xmath47 _ generator matrix _ @xmath48 , whose @xmath49 rows are @xmath2-bit words .",
    "the code consists of all linear combinations ( by bitwise exclusive - or ) of the rows of @xmath48 .",
    "this produces @xmath50 different words in the code .",
    "it can be shown that any linear code is also fully defined by its @xmath51 _ parity check matrix _ @xmath52 .",
    "the code consists of all words @xmath53 for which @xmath54 has even parity , for all rows @xmath55 of h , where the dot indicates the bitwise and operation .",
    "when @xmath54 has even parity , we say that `` @xmath53 satisfies the parity check @xmath55 '' .",
    "in other words , @xmath55 singles out a subset of the bits of @xmath53 , and it is the parity of this subset which is `` checked '' when we ascertain the parity of @xmath54 .    if @xmath44 is a linear code , then the dual code @xmath45 is defined to be the set of all words @xmath56 for which @xmath57 has even parity for all @xmath58 . if @xmath45 is the dual of @xmath44 , then @xmath44 is the dual of @xmath45 .",
    "the only property of dual codes which will interest us for the moment is that _ the generator matrix of a code @xmath44 is the parity check matrix of the dual code @xmath45_. ( this property is used in the derivation of theorem 3 , see steane 1996a . )",
    "using the formalism , it is possible to generalise the concept of multiple - particle ( or multiple - qubit ) interference .",
    "it is necessary first to extend slightly the definition of the generator matrix .",
    "we associate with each row @xmath59 of the matrix a phase factor @xmath60 , and when different rows are combined , these factors multiply : @xmath61 signifies the @xmath41th row with phase factor set to 1 . if a row is combined with itself , the resulting phase factor is defined to be 1 , so that the zero word is produced : @xmath62 .",
    "one may regard the words as vectors in a discrete @xmath2-dimensional vector space ( hamming space ) , and the phase factors as scalars .",
    "the generalised multiple - particle interference is defined through the following theorem .    * theorem 4 . * _ if @xmath48 generates the state in basis 1 , then the probability that the parity check @xmath63 is satisfied in basis 2 varies as @xmath64 . _    _ proof .",
    "_ this is closely related to the proof of theorem 3 . to find the effect of the @xmath41th row of @xmath48 ,",
    "first consider the state @xmath65 generated by @xmath66 in basis 1 , where @xmath66 consists of all rows of @xmath48 except the @xmath67 , with all phase factors set to 1 . by theorem 3 , for this state , all the parity checks of @xmath66 are satisfied in basis 2 . now complement , in basis 1 , the qubits specified by the @xmath41th row of @xmath48 .",
    "call the resulting state @xmath68 . by repeated applications of theorem 2 ,",
    "this has the effect that all words change sign in basis 2 which do not satisfy the parity check @xmath63 .",
    "now form @xmath69 the left hand side of this equivalence shows that the probability that the @xmath41th parity check is satisfied in basis 2 is proportional to @xmath70 , since if @xmath65 and @xmath68 are added ( subtracted ) , all words which satisfy ( respectively fail to satisfy ) the parity check @xmath63 disappear in basis 2 .",
    "the right hand side of the equivalence is the state generated by @xmath66 with the row @xmath59 added to it , since the selective bit - complementing operation which was carried out is in fact the exclusive - or operation . by applying this argument successively to all the rows of @xmath48 ,",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "theorem 4 is more easily understood in terms of an example , which will now be provided .",
    "consider the generator matrix @xmath71 this equation is to be understood as a @xmath72-column matrix of phase factors multiplying a @xmath72-row matrix of @xmath73-bit words .",
    "@xmath74 generates the state @xmath75 this code , appearing in basis 1 , is well known in classical coding theory .",
    "it is called the simplex code , since the 8 words define the 8 vertices of a regular simplex in @xmath73-dimensional space ( see for example macwilliams & sloane 1977 ) . in the quantum mechanical context",
    ", the code appears in @xmath76 as a 7-particle entanglement containing three 4-particle interferences .",
    "each phase @xmath77 is associated with a multiple - particle correlation among all those qubits which are selected by the @xmath41th row of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , by examining the matrix @xmath74 ( equation ( [ gsphi ] ) ) , one sees that for this example case there are 3 correlations , each involving a different 4-member subset of the 7 qubits .",
    "these correlations can be revealed by measuring the qubits in basis 2 , and calculating the relevent parity checks .",
    "i conjecture that such correlations satisfy bell - type inequalities similar to those deduced by mermin 1990 , though a demonstration is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "one may regard the linear codes as a generalisation to many qubits of the 2-qubit `` bell basis '' @xmath78 .",
    "this concludes the discussion of multiple particle interference _ per se_.",
    "the concepts introduced make a natural introduction to the following sections , which will provide more information on these interferences , such as a method for their generation , while discussing other issues .",
    "the set of @xmath2 qubits which we have been discussing may be considered to be a quantum computer ( deutsch 1985 ) . in the course of a computation ,",
    "entangled states involving many qubits at once are produced , and one of the fundamental problems of quantum computation is that such entanglements are highly sensitive to decoherence .",
    "` decoherence ' refers ( cf zurek 1993 ) to one class of departures of the quantum state of the computer from the state which it ought to have .",
    "we will not assume that decoherence is the only type of error process , however .",
    "rather , we seek to correct the computer ( or quantum channel ) in the presence of completely general unknown departures from the state the computer ought to have ( that produced purely by evolution under error - free computing operations )    an erroneous state of the whole computer will in general require correction methods operating on the whole computer at once in order to correct it .",
    "a method of this type was presented by berthiame _",
    ". some types of error can be corrected through a bit - by - bit method , on the other hand , in which operations only on small subsets of the qubits are required .",
    "shor 1995 proved that 9 qubits can be used to protect a single bit of quantum information against single errors , and steane 1995 introduced a 7-qubit scheme , and a general method for correcting many errors , while discussing limitations to robust encoding of a single qubit .",
    "the approach adopted in the latter work is generalised in this paper to enable robust encoding of a whole computer .",
    "also , the method of how to carry out error correction without disrupting the unitary evolution of the computation process is given .",
    "the philosophy pursued in this paper is to adopt methods suggested by the classical theory of error correction , and then to consider afterwards what types of error can be corrected by such methods .",
    "it will be argued that realistic physical systems can be found which are subject primarily to the type of error whose correction we discuss .",
    "the general scenario is that of a computer undergoing its normal computing operations , and interspersed among these are error correction operations .",
    "the qubits are assumed to decohere and generally change their state in an unpredictable manner .",
    "the word ` error ' will sometimes refer to a rotation of a qubit through @xmath79 radians about a given axis in hilbert space , which mimics the classical ` error ' where a bit is complemented , but in general the word will refer to any departure of a qubit from the state it ought to be in .",
    "a general error of a qubit can be considered as made up of phase error in basis 1 ( a rotation around the axis of the poincar or bloch sphere ) plus an amplitude error in basis 1 ( a rotation to different latitude on the sphere ) , plus a contribution due to entanglement with external systems , which , once those external degrees of freedom are traced over , causes the qubit s state to become mixed rather than pure .",
    "we will consider first the case of phase error alone , then a restricted class of external entanglements , and then more general errors .",
    "let us begin by considering the case that the qubits randomly dephase but never entangle with the environment , and never flip in basis 1 .",
    "this is the simplest non - trivial case , and is practically interesting because it may be possible to approximate it experimentally . in this simple situation ,",
    "the only errors are phase errors in basis 1 .",
    "the errors are modelled by rotating the @xmath41th qubit using an operator @xmath80 where the matrix has been written in basis 1 .",
    "the angles @xmath77 are independent , and @xmath81 is a parameter used to indicate the typical magnitude of the errors , @xmath82 .",
    "if the single qubit state @xmath83 is subject to such errors , its density matrix becomes @xmath84 since @xmath85 , the error in the off - diagonal elements is of order  @xmath81 .",
    "phase errors in basis 1 can be corrected as follows .",
    "each qubit in the quantum computer is ` encoded ' using a set of three physical qubits , by the encoding method shown in figure [ fig : enc01 ] .",
    "this set is then ` corrected ' from time to time by the correction method shown in figure [ fig : cor01 ] .",
    "computing operations , when required , can be carried out by a network equivalent to one which first ` decodes ' , then carries out the relevent operation , then encodes again .",
    "the decoding operation is the inverse of the encoding one .    to understand the error - correction scheme ,",
    "one notes that it is based on the simplest classical error correction code , the @xmath19 repetition code , operating in basis 2 .",
    "this is because phase errors in basis 1 cause amplitude errors in basis 2 , so we employ a scheme which corrects amplitude errors in basis 2 .",
    "a general single - qubit state @xmath86 is encoded by two controlled not ( cnot ) operations in basis  2 , where the first qubit is the control , the second is the target .",
    "cnot in basis 2 ( as here ) is the operator having the same form , but with @xmath87 and @xmath35 replaced by @xmath88 and @xmath43 . ]",
    "acting on an initial state @xmath89 ( see figure [ fig : enc01 ] ) .",
    "the state thus encoded using three qubits is @xmath90 therefore the only ` legal ' states are @xmath30 and @xmath34 or linear combinations of these .    the random phase errors in basis 1 cause departures from the subspace spanned by @xmath30 and @xmath34 . as long as the errors are small ,",
    "the component which was @xmath30 is likely to remain in the region of hilbert space spanned by @xmath91 while the component which was @xmath34 is likely to remain in the region spanned by @xmath92 .",
    "as long as only such ` single errors ' occur , they can be corrected .",
    "the error corrector shown in figure [ fig : cor01 ] works as follows .",
    "first , two cnot operations carry out parity checks .",
    "the checks required are those given by the parity check matrix for the @xmath93 repetition code : @xmath94 after these checks , the ` control ' qubit contains the state to be corrected , and the other two ` target ' qubits ( hereafter called parity qubits ) contain the error syndrome .",
    "the two parity qubits containing the syndrome are now measured .",
    "the syndrome indicates which qubit is to be complemented",
    ". that is , if the measurements give @xmath95 then the not operation is carried out on the control qubit .. not in basis 2 ( as here ) is @xmath96 . ]",
    "whatever the result of the measurements , the parity qubits are reset to @xmath97 . after this",
    ", the three qubits are in the decoded state .",
    "the final part of the error corrector reencodes the state .",
    "the effect of the above transformations can easily be calculated . once the encoding has been carried out , yielding the state given by equation ( [ encstate ] ) , all three bits are subjected to errors given by the operator ( [ errmat ] ) with independent unknown @xmath98 .",
    "the resulting erroneous state is to be corrected .",
    "the two cnot operations are applied , and measurements are modelled by projection operators .",
    "this yields 4 different density matrices for the 4 different measurement outcomes .",
    "the not operation is carried out on the relevent qubit or bits as indicated by the syndrome associated with each density matrix .",
    "the resulting four density matrices are added with the weights given by the probabilities of obtaining them .",
    "now we are at the stage just before the final reencoding .",
    "if instead of reencoding , we simply extract the density matrix of the control qubit , the result is equation ( [ errrho ] ) with @xmath99 when only one of the three angles @xmath77 is non - zero ( that is , one qubit is erroneous ) , the state is restored exactly , and when all three are non - zero , the error term is of order @xmath100 instead of order @xmath81 , as a taylor expansion of the trigonometric functions will show ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the corresponding properties of classical single - error correction are that single errors are corrected exactly , and error probabilities of order @xmath102 become of order @xmath103 after correction . since in this case",
    "the qubit error term goes directly to @xmath104 rather than @xmath105 , the correction is efficient . in the next section a case which mimics the classical behaviour",
    "more closely will be discussed .",
    "it has been assumed throughout that the process of encoding and correcting does not itself introduce more errors than it corrects .",
    "the discussion so far only demonstrates a modest correction ability .",
    "however , the concepts can be generalised , enabling the limitations of the method to be derived .",
    "we turn to this in later sections .",
    "the main result so far is to show that unitary evolution of a qubit can be preserved , while information about error processes is nevertheless gathered and used to correct the qubit . next it will be shown that the general methods discussed in this paper are not limited to the correction of unitary errors , but can enable the quantum computer to recover from relaxation caused by erroneous coupling to its environment .",
    "the single error correction in basis 2 discussed in the previous section with regard to unitary phase errors in basis 1 is also sufficient to correct a restricted class of relaxation errors ( ie errors caused by coupling to external systems ) .",
    "the restricted class is relaxation which does not cause amplitude errors in basis 1 .",
    "one can model such relaxation either as a decay in the off - diagonal density matrix elements of each qubit in basis 1 , or as an entanglement with the environment introduced by operators of the type @xmath106 here , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are orthogonal states of the environment , and the product states on the left of the operator matrix indicate the basis in which the matrix is written .",
    "the ( real ) parameter @xmath109 , bounded by @xmath110 , indicates the strength of the entanglement with the environment .",
    "the entanglement can be imagined as an imperfect ( @xmath111 ) or perfect ( @xmath112 ) measurement of the qubit in basis 1 .",
    "such entanglements , when perfect , have the effect of making the `` interference phase '' between the two parts @xmath6 and @xmath7 of qubit s state unobservable , as a straightforward analysis will show . no amplitude error is introduced in basis 1 , which is the clue that the ` simplest possible ' error - correction procedure introduced in the previous section will be sufficient to correct errors having this form .",
    "the effect of the entanglement @xmath113 on a single qubit is calculated by operating @xmath113 on the joint qubit ",
    "environment state @xmath114 , and then obtaining the reduced density matrix of the qubit by tracing over the environment variables .",
    "the result is a density matrix as in equation ( [ errrho ] ) , with @xmath115 this is clearly a mixed state when @xmath116 , and the error term is of @xmath117 .",
    "when we examine the density matrix in basis 2 , this error appears partly as an amplitude error , and it can be corrected by the encoding and correcting procedure described in the previous section ( figures [ fig : enc01 ] and [ fig : cor01 ] ) . to calculate the effects ,",
    "first the general single - qubit state @xmath118 is encoded using three qubits , then each of the three undergoes entanglement with the environment , described by three operators @xmath119 defined by equation [ entangle ] .",
    "the overall state then involves 8 different environment states , associated with 8 different 3-qubit states .",
    "the error correction procedure is carried out next . in the calculation",
    ", it appears as a set of eight independent corrections on each of the eight 3-qubit states .",
    "the final ` corrected ' 3-qubit density matrix is then taken to be the weighted sum of the eight 3-qubit density matrices associated with different states of the environment .",
    "the density matrix of the control qubit is extracted , yielding the form ( [ errrho ] ) with @xmath120 this result shows that when only a single qubit decoheres ( ie only one of the entanglement terms @xmath109 is non - zero ) , the state is corrected exactly ( @xmath121 ) , and when all three undergo errors , the error term is of @xmath105 instead of @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding properties of classical single - error correction are that single errors are corrected exactly , and error probabilities of order @xmath102 become of order @xmath103 after correction .",
    "the fact that the corrected density matrix is nearer to ` pure state ' conditions than the original density matrix ( when @xmath122 ) , is an example of a general phenomenon called ` quantum privacy amplification ' in the context of a quantum communication channel ( bennett _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; deutsch _ et al _ 1996 ) , and which will be referred to here as ` purity amplification ' .",
    "the ability to implement purity amplification is an important part of the general problem of error correction in quantum communication channels and computers .",
    "this section has shown that the approach to error correction adopted in this paper is capable of handling purity amplification . indeed , the ` quantum privacy amplification ' protocol described by deutsch _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 can be understood as an implementation of single - error _ detection _ in basis 1 and basis 2 simultaneously , by means of a single parity check in each basis .",
    "the fact that it is a detection rather than correction scheme explains why non - useful pairs of bits have to be thrown away .",
    "suppose now the type of error is completely general  there is an arbitrary change in the state of a qubit , including possible relaxation .",
    "to correct this , the method is to implement single error correction in both bases simultaneously . for this ,",
    "the encoding used in the previous section is not sufficient , since there single errors in basis 1 could not be corrected . to understand the encoding requirements ,",
    "the concept of _ minimum distance _ , introduced by hamming 1950 , is employed .",
    "the hamming distance between two words is equal to the number of bits which must be complemented in order to convert one word into the other .",
    "the minimum distance @xmath123 of a code is the minimum hamming distance between any two words in the code .",
    "a code of minimum distance @xmath124 is necessary if @xmath0 errors are to be corrected , since only if fewer than @xmath125 errors occur can the codeword which gave rise to the erroneous word can be identified unambiguously as the only codeword within distance @xmath125 of the erroneous word . in what follows ,",
    "the standard notation @xmath126 $ ] will be employed to refer to a linear code using @xmath2 bits , having @xmath50 codewords and minimum distance @xmath123 .    to correct for a general single error , we require an encoding allowing minimum distance 3 in both basis 1 and basis 2 . a method to do this",
    "was presented by steane 1996a , as follows .",
    "we seek a code @xmath44 having the following properties : its dual code @xmath45 has minimum distance 3 , and it is itself a subcode of a of code @xmath127 of minimum distance 3 .",
    "the reasoning behind this is best demonstrated by means of an example .",
    "the @xmath128 $ ] simplex code presented in section [ sec : mcheck ] has the properties required .",
    "its dual code is the @xmath129 $ ] hamming code which has minimum distance 3 , and it is a subcode of the @xmath129 $ ] punctured reed - muller code , also of minimum distance 3 .",
    "@xmath130 is the smallest number of bits for which a code can be found with these properties .",
    "the encoding and correcting procedure is shown in figures [ fig : enc11 ] and [ fig : cor11 ] , and explained as follows .",
    "the encoding method is based on the generator matrix of the @xmath128 $ ] simplex code , given by equation ( [ gsphi ] ) with @xmath131 .",
    "the simplex code thus generated will be called @xmath132 .",
    "it is the state @xmath76 shown in equation ( [ gsket ] ) with all phase angles set to zero .",
    "the essential idea is that a qubit state @xmath6 is encoded as @xmath132 , while a qubit state @xmath7 is encoded as @xmath133 , which is @xmath132 with the not operation carried out on all the qubits , ie the coset @xmath134 .",
    "it is easy to deduce that when the qubit @xmath135 to be encoded is in the state @xmath6 , the encoder shown in figure [ fig : enc11 ] places the 7 qubits in the state @xmath132 . to see that @xmath7 becomes encoded as @xmath133 ,",
    "consider the parity check matrix of @xmath132 : @xmath136 now , @xmath133 fails all those parity checks for which there is an odd number of @xmath35 s in the relevent row of @xmath137 , and passes the others .",
    "hence , the operations which generate @xmath132 when starting from @xmath138 , will generate @xmath133 when starting from @xmath139 , since the complemented qubits ensure that the final state will pass and fail the checks in @xmath140 in the way appropriate for @xmath133 .",
    "this initial complementing of qubits is the job of the first two cnot operations in the encoder .",
    "the encoder therefore encodes a general single qubit state @xmath141 as @xmath142 .",
    "now , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are subcodes ( strictly , cosets ) of the @xmath129 $ ] punctured reed - muller code @xmath143 whose parity check matrix is @xmath144 all legal encoded states satisfy this parity check matrix , and this is the basis of the corrector shown in figure [ fig : cor11 ] . the operation of the corrector is similar to that of the corrector presented in the previous section ( figure [ fig : cor01 ] ) .",
    "multiple cnot operations are used to carry out parity checks , the parity qubits are measured , and the state corrected by means of not operations on qubits identified by the measured syndrome .",
    "finally , the state is reencoded .",
    "so far , error correction has been carried out in basis 1 .",
    "however , the coding was carefully selected in such a way that only words in the @xmath129 $ ] hamming code @xmath45 should appear in basis 2 .",
    "therefore , error correction can also be carried out in basis 2 .",
    "the corrector is based on the parity check matrix of the @xmath129 $ ] hamming code , which is equal to the generator matrix of its dual , the matrix @xmath145 given in equation ( [ gsphi ] ) .",
    "now , it so happens that the @xmath129 $ ] hamming code is the same as the @xmath129 $ ] punctured reed - muller code ( this is not always true for higher order codes ) , as can be seen by the fact that @xmath145 and @xmath146 are equal ( one can be converted to the other by linearly combining rows ) .",
    "therefore , the corrector in basis 2 is once again given by figure [ fig : cor11 ] , only now all the operations are carried out in basis 2 .",
    "the correction scheme described will tend to keep the encoded state confined to the region of hilbert space spanned by the two state vectors @xmath147 .",
    "this is a two - dimensional subspace within the 128-dimensional total hilbert space .",
    "the subspace is also spanned by the state vectors @xmath148 defined by the even and odd parity subcodes of the @xmath129 $ ] hamming code in basis 2 , since theorem 4 implies that @xmath149 and @xmath150 , up to a normalisation factor .",
    "if an arbitrary single - qubit state is encoded as @xmath142 , and then any one ( but only one ) of the 7 qubits is allowed to change state and entangle with the environment in an arbitrary manner , the error corrector described in this section will return the 7 qubits exactly to the error - free state @xmath151 .",
    "this will be proved below as part of the more general theorem 6 . if more than one qubit is allowed to undergo errors , then error terms which would be of order @xmath81 in the density matrix of an uncorrected qubit become of order @xmath152 or higher when encoding and correction is employed .",
    "the previous sections have introduced almost sufficient insights to enable the general problem of multiple error correction of many qubits to be addressed .",
    "the final ingredient is theorem 5 below .",
    "before it is presented , we remark that just as in classical information theory , it is necessary to distinguish between the amount of information @xmath49 and the number of bits @xmath2 used in a @xmath126 $ ] code , it will be necessary here to distinguish between the number @xmath1 of independent quantum bits of information we wish to keep free of errors , and the number @xmath2 of qubits used to do this .",
    "thus , in section [ sec : c01 ] a single qubit was encoded , @xmath153 , by means of @xmath19 encoding qubits , and in section [ sec : c11 ] a single qubit @xmath153 was encoded by means of @xmath130 encoding qubits .    * theorem 5 . *",
    "_ to encode @xmath1 qubits with minimum distance @xmath154 in one basis , and minimum distance @xmath155 in the other , it is sufficient to find a linear code @xmath156 of minimum distance @xmath154 , whose @xmath1th order subcode @xmath44 is the dual of a distance @xmath155 code . _ + * corollary : * _ finding such a code is sufficient not only to demonstrate that the encoding is possible , but also to make self - evident the physical procedures for encoding and correction . _",
    "a @xmath1th order subcode of @xmath156 is a code obtained by adding @xmath1 rows to the parity check matrix of @xmath156 .    _",
    "proof : _ the general insight is that whereas in classical theory , information is encoded using different _ words _ of a code , in the quantum mechanical case , information is encoded using different _ cosets _ of a code .",
    "thus in section [ sec : c11 ] , cosets of the @xmath129 $ ] punctured reed - muller code , were used , and in section [ sec : c01 ] , the even parity and odd parity codes in basis 1 were cosets of the @xmath157 $ ] code of all possible words .    to encode @xmath1 qubits ,",
    "we require @xmath158 cosets . if these are all non - overlapping cosets of a distance @xmath154 code , then clearly they are all separated from one another by at least @xmath154 .",
    "that is , all words in one coset are at least @xmath154 from all words in another coset .",
    "we can ensure the cosets do not overlap by defining them as follows .",
    "@xmath1 new rows are added to the parity check matrix of @xmath156 .",
    "the new rows are linearly independent of each other and of all the other rows .",
    "( if this is not possible then @xmath2 must be increased and the argument restarted ) .",
    "each of the @xmath1 new parity checks can either be satisfied or not satisfied .",
    "this allows @xmath158 different possibilities , each of which produces a coset which has no words in common with any of the other cosets .",
    "hence the cosets are non - overlapping .",
    "suppose the first coset @xmath44 is a code having a dual @xmath45 .",
    "to obtain one of the other @xmath159 cosets from @xmath44 , it is sufficient to complement in basis 1 whichever parity qubits implement a parity check which @xmath44 satisfies but the new coset does not .",
    "the effect in the other basis is to change the sign of some of the words ( by theorem 2 ) .",
    "( equivalently , it is sufficient to change the sign of the relevent rows of the parity check matrix in basis 1 , which is the generator matrix in basis 2 , by theorem 4 )",
    ". therefore , each coset in basis 1 produces the words of @xmath45 in basis 2 , with signs depending on the coset .",
    "hence , for any superposition of the cosets in basis 1 , all words appearing in basis 2 are in the code @xmath45 . therefore , if we require minimum distance @xmath155 in basis 2 , it is sufficient that @xmath45 should be a distance @xmath155 code , and the theorem is proved .",
    "the coding method of theorem 5 uses a @xmath158-dimensional subspace to store the quantum information , within a total hilbert space of dimension @xmath39 .",
    "the subspace is spanned by the @xmath158 cosets of @xmath156 in basis 1 , and by @xmath158 cosets of @xmath45 in basis 2 .",
    "the encoding and correcting operations are deduced directly from the parity check matrices of the relevant linear codes , in the manner illustrated by figures [ fig : enc01 ] to [ fig : cor11 ] .",
    "an alternative approach to error correction is illustrated by figure [ fig : anc ] . to implement correction in basis 1 ( basis 2 ) ,",
    "a set of @xmath160 ( respectively @xmath161 ) ancillary qubits is introduced , and the error syndrome is stored into this ancilla by means of multiple cnot operations .",
    "the operations required are exactly those specified by the parity check matrix of @xmath156 ( respectively @xmath45 ) , which proves the corollary to theorem 5 .",
    "the ancilla is measured ( in the relevent basis ) , and the result used to calculate which qubits in the quantum computer are to undergo a not operation .",
    "this section is dedicated to the proof of the following theorem .    * theorem 6 . * _ error correction in basis 1 followed by error correction in basis 2 is sufficient to restore the quantum computer after arbitrary errors of a small enough subset of its qubits . specifically , if @xmath0 qubits undergo errors , then correction is successful if at least @xmath0 errors can be corrected in both basis 1 and basis 2 . _",
    "this theorem shows that the correction methods described in this paper are not limited to the correction of simple ` qubit complementing ' errors , but can handle any error process , as long as it only affects a subset of the @xmath2 qubits in the computer . to keep a clear distinction , the word _",

    ", we will require the following result : @xmath174 where the notation @xmath175 means the hamming weight is the number of @xmath35 s in @xmath0 . ] of @xmath176 , and the dot indicates the bitwise and operation carried out between @xmath41 and @xmath177 .",
    "the result holds for a particular type of coset @xmath178 , which will be identified shortly .",
    "it is obvious that a code can be written as the sum of its cosets : @xmath179 .",
    "the content of ( [ cij ] ) is the inverse result , that a coset @xmath180 can be written as a sum of ( erroneous ) codes .",

    "_ proof of equation ( [ cij])_. if @xmath178 is an @xmath0th order coset of @xmath182 , then the parity check matrix for @xmath178 consists of the parity check matrix of @xmath182 , plus @xmath0 extra rows .",
    "we consider the case that each of these extra rows contains all zeroes apart from a single @xmath35 .",
    "for example , for @xmath183 , @xmath184 , the @xmath185 cosets might be counted by the values of the fourth , sixth and tenth qubits in basis 1 , in which case the parity check matrix in basis 1 is @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the parity check matrix of @xmath181 .",
    "the @xmath41th coset passes or fails these extra parity checks according as the bits of the binary value of @xmath41 are zero or one .",
    "this pass@xmath188fail property is indicated by the sign ( power of @xmath189 ) in front of each row of the matrix . to generalise the use of such matrices in the quantum mechanical as opposed to classical context ( cf theorem 4 ) . ]",
    "thus , @xmath190 is the set of words of @xmath182 for which the 4th , 6th and 10th bits are zero , @xmath191 is the set of words of @xmath182 for which the 4th and 10th bits are one , and the 6th is zero , since decimal 5 is binary 101 , and so on .    in general , the type of coset for which equation ( [ cij ] )",

    "but , such a generator matrix will generate the code @xmath182 plus @xmath192 erroneous copies of @xmath182 , where a given copy will have flips of just the bits selected by those extra rows of the generator matrix which were used to generate that copy .",
    "hence , equation ( [ cij ] ) is proved .",
    "we now pass on to the question of general errors and their correction .",

    "a general defection among the @xmath0 defecting qubits is the process indicated by equation ( [ decoh ] ) , with the @xmath199 unchanged qubits acting as spectators , and with @xmath41 indicating the initial values of the decohering qubits .",
    "therefore , the effect of defection on @xmath180 is @xmath200 note that the state of the environment after defection is independent of @xmath201 in this equation .",

    "therefore , error correction in basis 1 and basis 2 is sufficient to restore the quantum computer after arbitrary errors of @xmath214 qubits , and theorem 6 is proved .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether errors can be supressed sufficiently to enable useful computations to be carried out on a quantum computer .",

    "the method is to establish the limitations implicit in the coding method described by theorems 5 and 6 .",

    "although @xmath215 is not known in general , a number of upper and lower bounds have been established . in what follows",

    "this is the `` bad news '' .",
    "the good news is that useful codes do exist .",
    "the gilbert - varshamov bound ( gilbert 1952 ; varshamov 1957 ; see also macwilliams & sloane 1977 ) is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the existence of a @xmath126 $ ] code . in the limit of large @xmath2",
    ", it takes the form @xmath221 where @xmath217 as @xmath218 .",
    "it can be shown ( macwilliams & sloane 1977 ) that there exists an infinite sequence of @xmath126 $ ] linear codes satisfying inequality ( [ gvn ] ) with @xmath222 if @xmath223 .",

    "substituting this bound ( [ gvn ] ) in equation ( [ k1k2 ] ) leads to @xmath236 inequalities ( [ limh ] ) and ( [ limgv ] ) are closely related to shannon s main theorem in the classical regime .",

    "for our present purposes , we note simply that shannon s theorem gives @xmath244 . comparing this with inequality ( [ limh ] )",
    ", one sees that classically the hamming bound gives a good guide to the limits of what is possible for an average distance between codewords , even though the _ minimum _ distance can not not reach the upper limit of the hamming bound , and indeed more restrictive bounds are known ( see macwilliams & sloane 1977 ) .",
    "this suggests that the hamming bound is a useful indicator in general , ie that codes which ` approach ' it in an average way do exist .",
    "returning to the quantum regime , let us consider for simplicity the case @xmath245 .",
    "this is the type of coding one would choose if the probabilities of errors in bases 1 and 2 were equal .",
    "if they are not equal , one can always choose @xmath123 sufficiently large to allow correction in the most error - prone basis , then it will also be more than sufficient for correction in the other basis . for @xmath245",
    ", inequalities ( [ limh ] ) and ( [ limgv ] ) give @xmath246 which , in the case @xmath247 , implies @xmath248 the inverse entropy function @xmath249 is defined for @xmath250 by @xmath251 iff @xmath252 . using @xmath253 , we find that encoding @xmath1 qubits using @xmath247 allows @xmath254 to be greater than @xmath255 , while @xmath254 is certainly less than @xmath256 .",
    "these limits are shown on figure [ hplot ] .    at this point ,",
    "a complete discussion would introduce the notion of the capacity of a noisy quantum channel .",
    "the capacity would be limited by error rates , and one would investigate whether error - free transmission is possible at rates close to capacity , as in shannon s theorem .",
    "however , the capacity of a noisy quantum channel is not yet understood , and the present author has not developed a satisfactory definition .",
    "the equivalent of shannon s noiseless coding theorem has been developed for the quantum regime by schumacher 1995 , and it is found that the number @xmath1 of qubits is a useful measure of `` amount of information '' in the quantum case , as one would hope . to understand the effect of noise ( ie errors ) in the quantum regime ,",
    "i conjecture that it is useful to model errors in a way analagous to that employed in classical information theory .",
    "that is , we _ assume _ that decoherence , relaxation and so on in a real quantum computer or information channel can be _ modelled _ by a stochastic treatment , in which , between two defined times , each qubit either defects ( undergoes an arbitrary error ) , or follows the error - free evolution governed by the known parts of the system hamiltonian . which of these two occurs for any given qubit during any given time interval is a random decision , the defection occuring with probability @xmath102 .",
    "this model is somewhat akin to the ` quantum jump ' or ` quantum monte carlo ' models of dissipative processes in quantum mechanics introduced by several authors in different contexts ( carmichael 1991 ; dalibard _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; dum _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; gisin 1984 ; mlmer _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that the model can provide a realistic description of a large class of real error processes '' , cf section [ sec : spa ] ) . ] .",
    "in fact the assumption we make is not that error processes can be _ fully _ modelled in this way , but merely that a scheme which can correct this assumed type of error will be able to correct satisfactorily the errors in a real physical computer .    with our stochastic model of errors ,",
    "an argument using the law of large numbers can be employed to show that the probability that uncorrectable errors occur falls to zero when codes of long enough minimum distance are employed , just as in classical information theory .",
    "thus , in the stochastic model , the probability that exactly @xmath0 errors ( defections ) occur among @xmath2 qubits is given by the binomial distribution , if we assume that errors in different qubits are independent .",
    "the probability that any number up to @xmath0 qubits defect is @xmath257 where @xmath102 is the probability of defection of a single qubit , during some defined interval of time @xmath258 .",
    "when @xmath259 , this can be approximated using the error function : @xmath260 where @xmath261 , @xmath262 . if an @xmath0-error correction scheme is implemented ( using a code of distance @xmath263 ) , then @xmath264 is the probability that the code can be corrected successfully . when the correction is successful , the state of the quantum computer is _ exactly _ what it should be ( the assumptions of the stochastic model permit this ` unphysical ' conclusion ) .",
    "if the whole computation requires a total number @xmath265 of time steps , each of duration @xmath266 , and error correction is carried out at the end of each time step , then the probability that the whole computation is free of errors is @xmath267 in the case of the binomial distribution , the law of large numbers is expressed by the fact that once the number of correctable errors @xmath268 becomes larger than the mean number of errors @xmath269 , the error function @xmath264 becomes arbitrarily close to 1 as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "to see just how close , we use the asymptotic expansion @xmath270 , for @xmath271 , which gives @xmath272 using inequalities ( [ knlim ] ) . the probability",
    "that the computer can not recover from errors falls exponentially with @xmath2 , as long as codes are used which keep close to the maximum possible correction ability ( ie hamming distance ) , and as long as @xmath102 is below an upper bound which does not depend on @xmath2 or @xmath1 .",
    "it has been supposed that such exponential stabilisation would be impossible for a quantum computer .",
    "indeed , it is a surprising result which goes right against the usual conclusion of the schrdinger cat paradox , in which macroscopic superpositions appear to be inherently unstable , and unstabilisable .",
    "however , using inequalities ( [ dnlimit ] ) ( cf figure [ hplot ] ) , we find that error - free computation is guaranteed to be be possible if @xmath273 .",
    "error - free computation is impossible if @xmath274 if correction is attempted using the type of coding method derived in this paper .",
    "however , we have not ruled out the possible existence of more powerful correction methods which would allow this upper limit on @xmath102 to be increased .    as an example , consider a computer requiring @xmath275 qubits , which are encoded using a set of @xmath276 qubits .",
    "inequalities ( [ knlim ] ) allow @xmath277 .",
    "suppose the error ( ie defection ) probability during each time step is @xmath278 , and @xmath279 time steps are required . during each step , on average @xmath280 errors occur , and the standard deviation of the error distribution is about @xmath281 .",
    "the probability of error - free computation is , from equation ( [ pt ] ) , @xmath282 .",
    "if @xmath102 is reduced to @xmath283 , on the other hand , then @xmath284 and error - free computation is almost certain for any reasonable length @xmath265 of the calculation .",
    "the error correction methods which have been presented involve many two - qubit cnot operations each time correction is carried out , and the whole process only works if these operations can be performed without introducing too many extra errors .",
    "the number of @xmath35 s in the parity check matrix of a @xmath126 $ ] code is about @xmath285 , since each message bit must be associated with at least @xmath286 parity checks .",
    "therefore , the error corrector of such a code involves of the order of @xmath285 two - qubit operations . for the case",
    "@xmath235 one uses coding with @xmath287 , and correction is carried out in both bases .",
    "therefore the total number of operations for one complete correction is of order @xmath288 .",
    "a logical choice would be to correct the whole computer every time an elementary computing operation is performed .",
    "therefore , the introduction of error correction causes the total number of two - qubit operations to be multiplied by @xmath289 .",
    "this is a modest extension of the resources necessary to complete a computation , since @xmath2 itself does not increase faster than the number @xmath1 of bits of quantum information employed .",
    "the great gains in computing power associated with `` quantum parallelism '' are retained in the corrected noisy computer .",
    "it may come as a surprise that the condition for error - free computation derived above is simply an upper bound @xmath290 on the error probability , rather than a scaling law for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath102 . however , this is in the nature of the approach we have adopted , since when @xmath291 , the number of errors that actually occur during any one time step is almost certainly very close to the average number @xmath292 , so the whole battle is won or lost on the ability to correct this number of errors .",
    "the corresponding limit in the classical regime is @xmath293 , above which error - free communication is impossible and the channel capacity falls to zero . indeed , if the only errors that occur in the quantum case are phase errors in one of the bases ( say basis 1 ) , then we can afford to use @xmath294 , and the coding problem reduces to the classical one , so @xmath102 can approach @xmath295 once again .",
    "the factor @xmath296 rather than @xmath35 appearing in the inverse entropy function arose because it was assumed just before inequalities ( [ knlim ] ) that arbitrary unknown errors will require correction in both basis 1 and basis 2 .",
    "it is here that the difference between a qubit and a classical bit enters : the extra degrees of freedom associated with the qubit mean that we do not know , in general , in which basis to correct it , so we are forced to correct it in two mutually rotated bases . by theorem 3",
    ", this means that both a code and its dual must be capable of correcting the expected error rate , so both @xmath297 and @xmath298 are limited by shannon s theorem .",
    "the classical and quantum cases can be compared thus : it should be stressed that the left hand side of this comparison represents a well - founded body of knowledge , while the right hand side involves some assumptions which remain to be investigated further .",
    "the whole argument has assumed that the process of error correction does not itself introduce defection ( ie decoherence etc ) .",
    "however this is an unrealistic assumption , since the error correction procedure is itself a special kind of quantum computation .",
    "clearly , the probability of error during one time step must be reckoned to increase with the number of operations needed to implement error correction .",
    "however , such errors can be corrected during the next time step , provided that they affect sufficiently few qubits .",
    "the analysis of this in detail is an important avenue for future work .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main contribution of this paper , and of calderbank and shor 1996 , has been to show how to adapt the classical methods of error correction to the quantum regime .",
    "theorems 5 and 6 are central .",
    "the sections leading up to them introduced the ideas , and those following examined the implications .",
    "the theorems show that a macroscopic quantum system can be stabilised by a judicious use of unitary operations and dissipative measurements .",
    "this is a type of feedback loop or ` quantum servo - control ' . among the results gained along the way",
    "are a useful taxonomy of types of multiple - particle ( or multiple - qubit ) interference , and a general insight into how to perform quantum purity amplification .",
    "these are basic properties of quantum theory , the former showing how information can be embodied in many qubits simultaneously , and the latter showing how quantum communication can be isolated from noise and evesdropping .",
    "the linear codes we have discussed constitute a generalisation of the ` bell basis ' to many qubits .",
    "the obvious need now is for a fuller understanding of the capacity of a noisy quantum channel . in particular",
    ", it would be useful to find out whether a stochastic model for errors in a quantum channel is sufficient to enable the error rate for many qubits to be estimated .",
    "also , the effect of noise during the error correction process needs to be investigated . on the experimental side",
    ", an implementation of the simplest error correction schemes using 3 or 7 qubits would be a significant step forward .",
