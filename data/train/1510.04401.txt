    "since the achievement of the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer)-bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover phenomenon@xcite in ultracold @xmath4k@xcite and @xmath3li@xcite fermi gases , physical properties of this strongly interacting fermi system have attracted much attention@xcite , especially in the unitary regime@xcite .",
    "in addition , the photoemission - type experiments on @xmath4k fermi gases@xcite have stimulated the research for the pseudogap phenomenon in the bcs - bec crossover region@xcite .",
    "although the pseudogap has extensively been discussed in the under - doped regime of high-@xmath2 cuprates@xcite , the complexity of this strongly correlated electron system still prevents us from the complete understanding of this many - body phenomenon@xcite .",
    "in contrast , an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region is simply dominated by pairing fluctuations .",
    "thus , once the pseudogap is observed in this atomic system , one can immediately conclude that it originates from preformed cooper pairs .",
    "this so - called preformed pair scenario@xcite is also a candidate for the pseudogap mechanism in high-@xmath2 cuprates , so that this observation would also contribute to the assessment of this scenario . at present",
    ", it has theoretically been pointed out@xcite that the deviation of the photoemission spectrum from the free particle dispersion observed in a @xmath4k unitary fermi gas@xcite may be an indirect evidence for the pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "however , since the current photoemission - type experiment does not have energy resolution enough to construct the single - particle density of states @xmath5 , a dip structure in @xmath5 ( which is the most direct evidence of the pseudogap phenomenon ) has not been confirmed yet . because of this , it is still in debate whether pairing fluctuations in an ultracold fermi gas really cause the pseudogap phenomenon or not@xcite .    in a previous paper@xcite , including strong pairing fluctuations within an extended @xmath1-matrix approximation ( etma)@xcite , we examined strong - coupling corrections to the spin susceptibility @xmath0 , which is experimentally accessible@xcite , in the normal state near the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 , to clarify that this magnetic quantity is useful for the study of pseudogap physics in an ultracold fermi gas with an @xmath6-wave pairing interaction .",

    "the formation of spin - singlet preformed cooper pairs was shown to suppress @xmath0 below the so - called spin - gap temperature @xmath8 . in the bcs - bec crossover region , this characteristic temperature @xmath8 was found to be comparable to the pseudogap temperature @xmath9 , which is determined as the temperature below which a dip structure appears in @xmath5 around @xmath10 .",
    "we also showed that the calculated spin - susceptibility agrees well with the recent experiment on a @xmath3li fermi gas@xcite , indicating that the observed small @xmath0 may be due to the formation of spin - singlet preformed cooper pairs near @xmath2 .",
    "we briefly note that , although the spin - gap phenomenon has also been discussed in high-@xmath2 cuprates@xcite , the origin of this anomaly , as well as relation to the pseudogap phenomenon , are still controversial in this electron system .",
    "in contrast , the pseudogap and the spin - gap in an ultracold fermi gas are different aspects of the same fluctuation phenomenon , where preformed cooper pairs play crucial roles .    while the pseudogap is usually discussed in the normal state , it is an interesting problem whether or not this phenomenon also occurs in the superfluid phase below @xmath2 .",
    "this problem was recently examined on the viewpoint of the superfluid density of states @xmath5@xcite , and it was clarified that the pseudogap in @xmath5 remains just below @xmath2 , to continuously change to the ordinary bcs - type superfluid gap at low temperatures , reflecting the suppression of pairing fluctuations by the superfluid order",

    "we emphasize that this mechanism is essentially the same as the preformed pair scenario for the spin - gap phenomenon above @xmath2 . in this sense , this smaller @xmath140 than @xmath11 may be regarded as the  superfluid spin - gap phenomenon . \" indeed , at @xmath2 , while all the bose - condensed cooper pairs vanish , @xmath0 is still suppressed by pairing fluctuations by non - condensed fermions , which smoothly connects to the spin - gap phase dominated by preformed cooper pairs above @xmath2 .",
    "we note that , in addition to the magnitude of the spin susceptibility , the temperature dependence of @xmath140 is also different from @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the latter mean - field case",
    ", the formation of cooper pairs only occurs below @xmath2 , so that the spin degrees of freedom is rapidly suppressed as one enters the superfluid phase , giving the remarkable decrease of @xmath11 just below @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , in the etma case , bose condensed cooper pairs below @xmath2 partially comes from preformed spin - singlet cooper pairs that have already existed above @xmath2 . since this part does not cause the further suppression of the spin degrees of freedom below @xmath2 , the decrease of @xmath0 with decreasing the temperature becomes weaker than the mean - field case in the superfluid phase near @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .     and the temperature @xmath1 . in the superfluid phase below @xmath2",
    ", the superfluid spin - gap temperature @xmath142 is determined as the temperature at which @xmath143 .",
    "below @xmath142 ( sf ) , pairing fluctuations are not crucial in the sense that the spin susceptibility can be essentially described by the mean - field expression , @xmath11 ( although we need to include strong - coupling corrections to @xmath20 and @xmath27 ) . above the spin gap temperature @xmath8 ( fl ) , @xmath0 monotonically increases with decreasing the temperature , as in the ordinary fermi liquid .",
    "the region between @xmath8 and @xmath142 is the spin - gap regime ( sg ) , where pairing fluctuations crucially affect @xmath0 . in this phase diagram",
    ", we also plot the line @xmath144 in the strong - coupling bec regime when @xmath145 .",
    "the region below this line may be regarded as a gas of two - body bound molecules , rather than an interacting fermi gas . in this regime ,  nb \" is the normal bose gas regime , and ",
    "mbec \" is the region of molecular bec . in this phase diagram",
    ", @xmath2 is only the phase transition temperature .",
    "the others are all characteristic temperatures , without being accompanied by any phase transition.,width=302 ]    we also note that fluctuating spin - singlet pairs of bogolons also give a finite lifetime of bogoliubov excitations , leading to a finite width of their spectral peaks .",
    "this phenomenon smears the energy gap structure in @xmath5 , giving the  pseudogapped \" superfluid density of states shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7](a2 ) and ( b2 ) .",
    "because of this , as mentioned previously , the pseudogapped superfluid density of states @xmath5 shown in these figures and the spin - gapped spin susceptibility @xmath0 ( @xmath146 ) seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are considered as different aspects of the same many - body phenomenon associated with pairing fluctuations in a superfluid fermi gas .",
    "although there is no clear phase boundary between the superfluid spin - gap regime ( where @xmath137 and @xmath147 ) and the bcs - like superfluid phase where @xmath132 and @xmath148 , it is still convenient to introduce a characteristic temperature to physically distinguish between the two regions . as an example , plotting the temperature @xmath142 at which @xmath149 , we obtain the  phase boundary \" between the spin - gap regime ( sg ) and the superfluid regime ( sf ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . together with our previous work above @xmath2@xcite ,",
    "the spin - gap regime is conveniently identified as the region between the superfluid spin - gap temperature @xmath142 ( @xmath150 ) and the spin - gap temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath151 ) in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "here , @xmath8 is determined as the temperature at which @xmath0 takes a maximum value@xcite .",
    "above @xmath8 (  fl \" in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , @xmath0 increases with decreasing the temperature as in the case of the ordinary normal fermi liquid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we also plot @xmath152 in the strong - coupling bec regime where @xmath153@xcite . since @xmath154 equals the binding energy @xmath155 of a two - body bound molecule in the extreme bec limit , this quantity has the meaning of the characteristic temperature below which two - body bound molecules start to be formed , overwhelming thermal dissociation@xcite .",
    "thus , the system below @xmath152 would be rather close to a molecular bose gas , rather than an interacting fermi gas . in this molecular regime",
    ", the region above @xmath2 may be viewed as a normal bose gas ( nb ) , and the region below @xmath2 is in the molecular bec phase ( mbec)@xcite .    in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , @xmath2 is only the phase transition temperature .",
    "@xmath142 , @xmath8 , as well as @xmath152 , are all characteristic temperatures , without being accompanied by any phase transition . as a result , the boundary of the spin - gap regime ( sg ) in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] somehow involves ambiguity .",
    "however , apart from this , the present spin - gap regime in the phase diagram of an ultracold fermi gas in terms of the interaction strength and the temperature is consistent with the previous pseudogap regime determined from the pseudogapped density of states@xcite . as mentioned previously , while @xmath5 is still difficult to observe in cold fermi gas physics , the spin susceptibility @xmath0 is experimentally accessible both above and below @xmath2@xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath0 is a useful quantity to experimentally explore the region where the preformed pair scenario works in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed the spin susceptibility @xmath0 in a strongly interacting superfluid fermi gas . including pairing fluctuations within the framework of an extended @xmath1-matrix approximation ,",
    "we have examined how strong - coupling corrections to this magnetic quantity are affected by the superfluid order in the bcs - bec crossover region .    in the bcs side ( @xmath156 )",
    ", we showed that @xmath0 decreases with decreasing the temperature below the spin - gap temperature @xmath8 , and the suppression becomes more remarkable below @xmath2 .",
    "this is because , while the spin - gap phenomenon above @xmath2 is dominated by fluctuating preformed spin - singlet cooper pairs , they start to become stable below @xmath2 , which accelerates the suppression of spin excitations .    in the strong - coupling bec regime , on the other hand , tightly bound spin - singlet molecules have already been formed above @xmath2 , and @xmath0 is dominated by their thermal dissociation both above and below @xmath2 . because of this , while @xmath0 in this regime also decreases with decreasing the temperatures as in the bcs side near @xmath8 , the detailed temperature dependence is not sensitive to the superfluid phase transition .    in the bcs side of the bcs - bec crossover region , we found that @xmath0 is well described by the yosida function @xmath11 far below @xmath2 , when strong - coupling corrections to the fermi surface size and the superfluid order parameter are appropriately taken into account . in this low temperature region ,",
    "the superfluid density of states @xmath5 has a clear energy gap as in the mean - field bcs state .",
    "thus , apart from the above - mentioned strong - coupling corrections , superfluid properties far below @xmath2 are essentially the same as the ordinary bcs superfluid , even in a unitary fermi gas .",
    "however , @xmath0 gradually becomes smaller than the mean - field result @xmath11 with increasing the temperature .",
    "this is because fermi quasi - particles excited thermally ( bogolons ) attractively interact with each other , to cause pairing fluctuations , where formation and pair - breaking of spin - singlet pairs frequently and repeatedly occur .",
    "this strong - coupling effect is completely ignored in the mean - field theory ( where bogolons are treated as non - interacting fermions ) . as a result",
    ", the preformed pair scenario works in the superfluid phase near @xmath2 , giving the smaller @xmath0 than the bcs result , @xmath11 .    as a useful characteristic temperature",
    "to physically distinguish between the low temperature superfluid region where @xmath132 and the high temperature superfluid region where pairing fluctuations crucially affect @xmath0 , we conveniently introduced a superfluid spin - gap temperature @xmath142 .",
    "we then determined the spin - gap regime , where pairing fluctuations crucially affects @xmath0 , as the region surrounded by @xmath142 , the spin - gap temperature @xmath8 , and @xmath152 ( which physically gives the boundary between the fermi gas regime and the molecular bose gas regime ) , in the phase diagram of an ultracold fermi gas with respect to the interaction strength and the temperature .",
    "this spin - gap regime is consistent with the previous pseudogap regime that was determined from the pseudogapped density of states@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have assumed a uniform superfluid fermi gas , although the real system is always confined in a trap potential .",
    "since the recent experiment on the spin susceptibility in a @xmath3li fermi gas@xcite is based on a local measurement of spin fluctuations , it is an interesting future problem to clarify how the spatial inhomogeneity affects the spin - gap phenomenon discussed in this paper .",
    "since the direct observation of the single - particle density of states seems difficult in the current stage of cold fermi gas physics , our results would be useful for the study of pseudogap phenomenon using the spin susceptibility , which is experimentally accessible both above and below @xmath2 .",

    "<S> rev . a * 89 * , 033617 ( 2014 ) ] , including pairing fluctuations within an extended @xmath1-matrix approximation ( etma ) , we showed that strong pairing fluctuations cause the so - called spin - gap phenomenon , where @xmath0 is anomalously suppressed even in the normal state near the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we extend this work to the superfluid phase below @xmath2 , to clarify how this many - body phenomenon is affected by the superfluid order . from the comparison of the etma @xmath0 with the yosida function describing the spin susceptibility in a weak - coupling bcs superfluid </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the region where pairing fluctuations crucially affect this magnetic quantity below @xmath2 in the phase diagram with respect to the strength of a pairing interaction and the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this spin - gap regime is found to be consistent with the previous pseudogap regime determined from the pseudogapped density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results with a recent experiment on a @xmath3li fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin susceptibility is sensitive to the formation of spin - singlet preformed pairs , our results would be useful for the study of pseudogap physics in an ultracold fermi gas on the viewpoint of the spin degrees of freedom . </S>"
