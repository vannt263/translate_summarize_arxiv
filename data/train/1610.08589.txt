    "we consider numerical inversion of a forward deformation vector field ( dvf ) from one image to another . very often the inverse dvf is needed along with the forward dvf to map medical images , structures , or doses back and forth throughout the process of 4d image reconstruction and adaptive radiotherapy  @xcite .",
    "the inverse dvf may be obtained in different ways , such as through deformable registration with swapped inputs , simultaneous registration in both directions , or inverting the forward dvf from the reference image to the deformed target image . the latter option ( inverting the forward dvf ) is often preferred in clinical applications , due to several reasons :",
    "inversion is typically faster , empirically ;    image quality can be quite different for the reference and target image sets , which may make the other approaches more error - prone  @xcite ; and    inversion can ensure consistency between forward and inverse dvfs  @xcite .",
    "previously , chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed a fixed - point iteration method for dvf inversion . in this study",
    ", we aim to advance the dvf inversion approach further by improving its convergence behavior , in terms of convergence region and rate , using a feedback control .",
    "the problem of dvf inversion can be framed as follows .",
    "the reference and target images , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , can be related to one another by two non - linear transformations . the forward transformation , @xmath5 , maps the voxels of the reference image , @xmath3 , onto those of the target image , @xmath4 , via the forward deformation vector field , @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the 3d displacement of the reference voxel at @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the image domain .",
    "conversely , the backward transformation , @xmath11 , maps the voxels of @xmath4 back to @xmath3 , @xmath12 via @xmath13 , the reverse dvf .",
    "the problem of dvf inversion is to obtain @xmath14 given @xmath15 .",
    "the two transformations are the inverse of each other , i.e. , @xmath16 consequently , the forward and backward dvfs satisfy the _ simultaneous inverse consistency condition _ :    [ eq : consistency - condition ] @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "inverse consistency is of great importance to deformable registration and estimation of 4d dose accumulation , among other biomedical applications @xcite .",
    "the inverse consistency condition is commonly incorporated in deformable registration processes .",
    "for instance , christensen and johnson  @xcite formulate image registration using objective functions symmetrically between the two images in both matching and regularization terms .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also treat the two images symmetrically , and use inverse consistency in approximating the unknown inverse fields .",
    "additional related studies on employing the consistency condition in simultaneous estimates of the forward and inverse dvf can be found in the survey by sotiras _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study reported in this paper follows and improves upon the work of chen _ et al . _",
    "the precursor work presented a fixed - point iteration method for dvf inversion , with regard to inverse consistency condition .",
    "the significance of that work lies not only in the simple iterative process , but also in the corresponding convergence condition .",
    "assuming @xmath6 is given , chen s iteration proceeds as , @xmath19 the initial guess , @xmath20 , is set to zero ; i.e. , @xmath21 . negating the forward dvf used to a prevailing approach for inverse dvf computation , but the resulting inverse estimate , @xmath22 , does not in general satisfy inverse consistency .",
    "this common misconception was made clear and amended by the fixed - point iteration solution of ( [ eq : fpim ] ) . with fixed - point method ,",
    "the convergence behavior of the iterative inversion process can be analyzed , which is a substantial advancement from previous methods which solely relied on empirical studies .",
    "a sufficient convergence condition for ( [ eq : fpim ] ) is the contraction condition on @xmath6 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a well - defined distance metric in the 3d image domain , and @xmath25 is a lipschitz constant , @xmath26 .",
    "the convergence behavior of chen s iteration depends passively on this condition , which is not always met in clinical cases with large deformation . in this study",
    ", we introduce an iterative method with an active feedback control mechanism . at each step of the iteration",
    ", we compute a residual which measures the inconsistency between the forward dvf and the iterative inverse estimate , see ( [ eq : residual - r ] ) .",
    "the residual is incorporated into the next iterate after being modulated by the feedback control .",
    "the feedback control provides an extra handle for controlling and improving the convergence behavior .",
    "the rest of the document is organized as follows . in",
    ", we describe the new iterative method with feedback control , introduce a simple feedback control mechanism , and provide the underlying principle . in , we make experimental assessment of the new method with an analytic dvf pair and with numerical dvfs obtained via the 4d extended cardiac - torso ( xcat ) digital anthropomorphic phantom  @xcite . in , we conclude the presented work and give additional remarks on extended feedback control .",
    "an iterative method with feedback control is first introduced for numerical dvf inversion .",
    "an analysis is then provided for steering the feedback mechanism to improve convergence behavior .      at each iteration step , we get an iterative estimate , @xmath27 , of the inverse dvf , @xmath14 . we use the residual with respect to the consistency condition of ( [ eq : consistency - condition ] ) as the feedback : @xmath28 the residual can be obtained at each iteration step .",
    "this computationally available quantity allows us to monitor and control the ( unknown ) estimate error , @xmath29 which is to be reduced to zero , or sufficiently close to zero , via the iteration process .",
    "the residual @xmath30 is small when the error @xmath31 is small , and @xmath31 is zero when @xmath27 is equal to the inverse satisfying the consistency condition ( [ eq : consistency - condition ] ) .",
    "feedback control is introduced in the iteration process as follows . the residual for the @xmath32-th iterate , @xmath33 ,",
    "is calculated , modulated by a nonsingular matrix @xmath34 , and used as an incremental correction , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a @xmath37 matrix , local to each @xmath38 .",
    "feedback control is spatially homogeneous when @xmath34 does not vary with @xmath9 .",
    "there are many formulations or reformulations of a fixed - point equation .",
    "the formulation in ( [ eq : fpim - general ] ) is a general formulation for fixed - point iterations , with feedback control @xmath34 modifying and transforming the residual before it is fed back to @xmath39 . in this study , we focus on the feedback mechanism in its simplest form  with a single parameter .",
    "we let @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the identity matrix , and @xmath42 is a scalar which may be referred to as the relaxation parameter .",
    "the iteration process thus takes the simple form : @xmath43 when @xmath44 , the iteration of ( [ eq : fpim - single - parameter ] ) reduces to chen s iteration of ( [ eq : fpim ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the iteration procedure by chen _",
    "_ as the iteration with feedback control @xmath45 .",
    "we first demonstrate how the feedback control can be designed for inverting the analytic dvfs introduced by chen _",
    "et al . _",
    "the forward and backward dvfs are expressed by the following closed - form formulas over a 2d spatial domain :    [ eq:2d - analytic - dvfs ] @xmath46    where @xmath9 denotes cartesian coordinates in the 2d spatial domain @xmath47^{2}$ ] , and @xmath48 is the corresponding angular coordinate in the polar representation , @xmath49 .",
    "the dvf functions have two constant parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "illustrates a source image and two target images ; the latter are related to the former by the analytic dvfs of ( [ eq:2d - analytic - dvfs ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the analytic dvfs satisfy the consistency condition of ( [ eq : consistency - condition ] ) .    when @xmath52 , there is no deformation .",
    "when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the displacement ( forward or backward ) at @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath9 . with @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the deformation at @xmath9 remains in the radial direction , but its magnitude varies with @xmath50 and @xmath57 ; when @xmath50 is close to or larger than @xmath58 , the deformation becomes large at and near angles where @xmath59 .",
    "the iteration with control @xmath45 converges slowly when @xmath50 approaches @xmath58 from below , and becomes divergent when @xmath50 is greater than @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the contraction condition ( [ eq : contraction - condition ] ) no longer holds at all @xmath48 values when @xmath60 .    1 iteration    5 iterations    10 iterations     +    to improve convergence , we begin by taking a closer look at how errors propagate through the iteration process .",
    "errors in two successive iteration steps are related by the following propagation equation : @xmath61     \\cdot   { \\mathbf{e}}_{k } ( { \\mathbf{x}}).\\ ] ] our objective is to suppress the iterative error ( [ eq : error - propagation - customized ] ) at every step and make it vanish at a faster pace .",
    "when @xmath45 and @xmath60 , the error propagation factor is greater than one at and near angular locations where @xmath62 .",
    "wherever the factor is greater than @xmath0 , the iterative errors are magnified instead of suppressed at each iteration .",
    "this explains the divergent behavior with @xmath45  at certain polar angles when @xmath63 , as illustrated in . when @xmath45 and @xmath64 , the propagation factor is less than @xmath0 at any @xmath48 , and the iteration converges in theory .",
    "but as @xmath50 approaches to @xmath58 from below , the iteration becomes slower .",
    "further analysis , provided in  , shows that the single - parameter feedback control can be employed to achieve convergence over the entire image domain with this analytic dvf pair .",
    "we claim specifically that , for any @xmath65 , there exists some @xmath66 which satisfies the following necessary and sufficient convergence condition : @xmath67 under this condition , the iteration ( [ eq : fpim - single - parameter ] ) converges over the entire image domain for any @xmath65 , with arbitrary initial guess . for @xmath68 , iteration with the feedback control",
    "@xmath45 fails to meet the necessary and sufficient condition .    among the feasible values for the parameter @xmath42",
    ", one may find , by the propagation factor in ( [ eq : error - propagation - customized ] ) , that some values of @xmath42 render faster convergence than others .",
    "in particular , we find the optimal value , @xmath69 we provide the proofs of ( [ eq : error - propagation - customized ] ) , ( [ eq : specific - mu - condition ] ) and ( [ eqn : optimal - mu - specific ] ) in .      in this section",
    ", we will describe the basic principle , objectives and approach for feedback control , taking into consideration that , in practice , the forward dvf is provided in numerical values over a discrete spatial domain , not in a closed - form expression .    the design of feedback control is based in principle on the error propagation analysis . for the iteration of ( [ eq : fpim - single - parameter ] ) with a single control parameter @xmath42 , the error propagation equation may be described in the first order form ,    @xmath70    where @xmath41 is the identity matrix , @xmath71 is a location in @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 denotes the jacobian of @xmath15 evaluated at @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denotes the error propagation matrix . in order to express the error propagation matrix in a first - order form , we assume that @xmath15 is smooth almost everywhere over the spatial domain and the jacobian can be well approximated from the numerical values of @xmath15 .    the first control objective is to make the propagation matrix @xmath76 a contractor over the image domain of interest , which implies that the convergence region must span the entire image domain . when the feedback control , @xmath36 , is limited by a specific mechanism structure , one may consider making the convergence region in the image domain as large as possible . the second objective is to make the convergence as fast as possible .",
    "we describe in particular the control design approach with the single - parameter control mechanism .",
    "first , we find the feasible values of @xmath42 over which @xmath76 is a contractor over the spatial domain of interest , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the spectral radius of the propagation matrix .",
    "if the feasible set is not empty , we next locate the values of @xmath42 that reach the fastest convergence speed possible . in",
    ", we have demonstrated how to achieve these objectives with analytic dvfs . in",
    ", we will introduce a simple approach to locate @xmath42 in practical situation where the dvf is numerically provided , without a closed - form expression .",
    "we present experimental results for assessing the new iterative method .",
    "first , we will describe the data sets and assessment measures .",
    "two particular sets , referred to as set a and set b for convenience , were used for evaluating the single - parameter feedback control process of ( [ eq : fpim - single - parameter ] ) .",
    "data set a is analytically designed by chen _",
    "et al . _",
    "it includes a reference image and a deformed ( target ) image , in 2d , as shown in .",
    "the reference image is binary - valued ; the intensity is one over the concentric rings , and @xmath79 otherwise .",
    "the dvf from the reference to the target image follows the analytic expression ( [ eq:2d - analytic - dvfs ] ) . in the experiments ,",
    "the dvf parameter @xmath51 is set to @xmath80 , and the parameter @xmath50 takes values below or above @xmath58 ( which is the critical point for chen s iteration from converge to diverge ) .",
    "data set b consists of two images of a digital lung phantom generated using xcat  @xcite .",
    "the reference image is at the end - of - expiration phase and the target image is at the end - of - inspiration phase .",
    "the forward dvf , from the reference to the target image , was provided by xcat .",
    "respiratory motion was generated by two parametrized sinusoidal curves : one for diaphragm motion in the si direction , and one for chest surface motion in the ap direction .",
    "the curve and surface parameters were set to the xcat default values , with a respiratory cycle , and asymmetric sinusoidals with respect to inspiration and expiration duration .",
    "peak - to - peak displacements at the diaphragm and chest surface were set to and in si and ap directions , respectively .",
    "the large displacements were chosen in order to test the convergence behavior of the iteration methods in a challenging condition that may be expected in a clinical scenario  @xcite .",
    "voxel resolution was set to @xmath81 mm in all three dimensions .",
    "the xcat phantom deformation fields are mostly smooth over the image domain , except at certain surface boundaries , such as around the spine .",
    "we use two kinds of schemes for assessing the effect of feedback control on convergence behavior .",
    "the first kind of scheme shows the spatial variation of errors using images or error maps .",
    "the second kind scheme uses scalar quantities to summarize estimate errors in the worst case or in aggregation .    for dataset",
    "a , visual assessment of spatial variation of errors is materialized in two ways . in one ,",
    "the proxy target and references images are constructed by the inverse dvf estimate under evaluation . in the other ,",
    "a map of pixel - wise residuals is overlaid on the target image .",
    "the scalar assessment scheme comprises the maximal residual error and the maximal absolute error at each iteration ,    [ eq : max - errors ] @xmath82    where @xmath10 is the image domain , @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] . for dataset b , the scheme for assessing the spatial variation of errors is similar to that for dataset",
    "a , except that proxy images are constructed for only the target phase , for the following reason . unlike the ideal case with dataset a",
    ", local transforms of image voxels by the dvfs may not be one - to - one numerically , which happens to be the case with the backward transform for dataset b. this numerically ill condition makes the constructed reference images via numerical interpolation much more susceptible to numerical artifacts , especially around the outer body interface .",
    "the scalar assessment scheme is limited to the measure of residual errors , as the absolute errors are not obtainable with the exact inverse unknown .",
    "taking into account the presence of discontinuities at certain boundaries and other sources of variation , residual errors are assessed via percentiles at different levels , defined as , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the normalized cumulative histogram of @xmath86 , and the image domain @xmath10 excludes voxels outside the body . in particular",
    ", we use percentiles with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we present experimental results , in  , with the analytical dvf of ( [ eq:2d - analytic - dvfs ] ) , at two dvf parameter settings .",

    "we have introduced an iterative method for numerical dvf inversion with a feedback control mechanism to improve convergence behavior .",
    "we have described and demonstrated the key principle for altering and controlling error propagation , and a methodology for determining the control parameters numerically as well as analytically .",
    "experimental results are in agreement with the presented error analysis and control design objectives .",
    "we give below some additional comments on computational issues and extended feedback control mechanisms .",
    "the iteration ( [ eq : fpim - general ] ) can be described alternatively as the following procedure with two sub - steps per iteration ,    [ eq : two - step - relaxed ] @xmath107    the first sub - step @xmath108 is the same as chen s iteration .",
    "the second sub - step makes a modification by a combination of the estimates at step @xmath32 and sub - step @xmath109 .",
    "the alternative computation procedure is mathematically equivalent with respect to convergence analysis , to iteration ( [ eq : fpim - general ] ) , although the residual feedback is not used explicitly .",
    "the residuals can be effectively utilized in termination criteria .",
    "commonly used termination criteria include a threshold on the numerical difference between two successive iterates and an upper bound on the total number of iteration steps .",
    "the threshold is set based on an acceptable precision in computed results , and it should not be set higher than the computational precision used , such as ieee single or double precision . a process is terminated by the numerical threshold criterion either because the iteration has converged numerically , or because its progression is too slow .",
    "we would need an additional indicator to differentiate the two cases . recall that the residual is related , but not necessarily equal , to the difference between successive iterates .",
    "if the residual is not sufficiently small , the estimate is far from meeting the inverse consistency condition and the iteration has not converged well enough .",
    "the single - parameter feedback control described in [ subsec : feedback - control ] is simple .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is kept constant over the spatial domain and across all iteration steps .",
    "while this simple control mechanism proved effective with the analytic and xcat dvf data used in this study , the robustness of the convergence can be further improved by extending the control in the following two approaches .",
    "the first extension is to turn the constant parameter to a spatially variant control function @xmath110 .",
    "in fact , by the error propagation analysis specific to the analytic dvf ( [ eq:2d - analytic - dvfs ] ) , an ideal control scheme is spatially - variant , @xmath111 .",
    "both analysis and numerical results ( not presented in this paper ) show that the iteration with @xmath112 takes only one or two steps for the residuals to drop to numerical zero , as determined by the machine precision .",
    "since the residual is vector - valued in general , a spatially - variant control function @xmath36 with @xmath113 matrix local to each @xmath9 can be used .",
