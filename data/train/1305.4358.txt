    "in the past decade a new wave of theoretical and experimental interest in electron capture processes , involving two active electrons , as double capture ( dc ) , transfer ionization ( ti ) and transfer excitation ( te ) , has shed light on the versatile effects of electron correlation .",
    "new experimental techniques allow to measure more than only total or single differential cross section ( sdcs ) .",
    "fully differential cross sections ( fdcs ) , which depend on the momentum distribution of the escaped electron in ti give a rather detailed view in the dynamical processes taking place .",
    "in particular , in this paper we consider the reaction p+he",
    "@xmath0 h+he@xmath1+@xmath6 .",
    "since the early publications @xcite it became clear that two principal mechanisms contribute to the transfer ionization .",
    "this takes place via a capture of one electron with a correlated ( shake - off , so ) or sequential process ( binary encounter , be ) , removal of the second electron .",
    "we use this terminology in accord with single photon ionization of an atom @xcite in spite of quite different transfer energies in both cases .",
    "let us concentrate further on the single transfer ionization , because this process is a subject of this paper .",
    "direct capture presumes the `` usurpation '' of one target electron by the fast projectile proton , like it was described in @xcite , and releasing of another electron due to the sudden rearrangement of the field in the residual ion ( typical so ) . if the fast proton is described by the plane wave in the lab frame , and its scattering angles are very small ( fractions of mrad ) , then the obk - mechanism @xcite presents the principal transition matrix element alike to that for electron momentum spectroscopy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in turn , it was shown that latter one is very sensitive to angular and radial electron - electron correlations in the target @xcite .",
    "the captured electron always moves forward parallel to the velocity vector of the proton projectile , i.e. its momentum component is positive .",
    "if the electron - electron correlation in the target is weak ( say , only due to a mean field ) , the emitted electron will be shaken off isotropically . in the opposite case of strong angular correlations it moves predominantly in backward direction ( @xmath7 ) and",
    "we expect to see a backward peak in the electron momentum distribution .",
    "a different process ( analogue to radiative electron capture ) also resulting in a backward emitted electron was suggested by voitkiv and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these calculations lack of high differentiality , as the are neither in the scattering angle dependent nor in the scattering plane .",
    "therefore we will show our data only in the longitudinal vs. transversal representation .",
    "the sequential mechanism of ti presumes at least two successive interactions of the fast projectile with both target electrons . for its realization",
    "no electron - electron correlations are needed .",
    "this mechanism in general is of the second order ( and higher ) in the projectile - target interaction .",
    "however , features of the capture processes allow to define transfer ionization already with a first order amplitude @xcite . after interaction of the bound electron with the fast projectile proton",
    "it becomes also fast .",
    "it can interact again with another electron or the target nucleus on its way out ( pure second order @xmath8- and @xmath9-thomas , for example @xcite ) , but its movement keeps in general the forward character @xmath10 .",
    "so , the forward peak can be connected with the be mechanism ; capture and ionization are generally independent .",
    "of course , the above considerations are semiclassical , we shall see an interplay of quantum mechanisms and coherent sum of corresponding matrix elements , but we expect the general forward - backward features to be present also in a full quantum treatment .",
    "we think , it is a time to defend the pwfba , because first born theories are often believed to be inadequate for electron capture .",
    "we would like to stress that it is not so .",
    "first , any fba theory works well until the higher born terms become bigger in the region of final state phase space considered .",
    "so for example at very small scattering angles of a fast projectile ion ( proton ) , the obk term is a leading one but if falls down rapidly with increasing scattering angle , and the higher order terms begin to contribute .",
    "but they do not contribute much at very small angles ( see calculations in @xcite ) .",
    "second , the obk matrix element , as it was considered 80 years ago , now can include much better correlated trial wave functions .",
    "this plays a crucial role for transfer excitation and transfer ionization reactions ( less for charge transfer ) . at very small projectile scattering angles ,",
    "the corresponding sdcs curves for highly and loosely correlated target ground functions start to differ substantially .",
    "third , we have now two main approaches for capture reaction : time - dependent semiclassical and pure quantum mechanical . within the time - dependent approach the heavy fast projectile particle",
    "is considered a source of a classical outer field .",
    "the interaction of both , projectile and target ion , can easily be taken into account as a phase - factor to the final ( initial ) wave function @xcite . in the pure quantum approach ( see , for example , @xcite ) the interaction of heavy particles gives a contribution to the fba , and this term distorts noticeably the obk term both at very small ( here the distortion is `` positive '' , it diminishes the peak value ) and at larger scattering angles ( here this distortion is `` negative '' , it increases the plateau ) .",
    "it was shown that sba terms can compensate this negative effect and considerably improve the agreement between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "physically it is clear that if the transferred momentum and energy are relatively small ( we are in a laboratory frame , and this takes place at very small scattering angles ) , then the velocity of atomic nucleus is practically zero , and it is actually immovable during the scattering process .",
    "the nucleus simply changes the initially directed path of the projectile due to elastic scattering ( `` secondary '' obk ) .",
    "this is the main physical role of this term at scattering angles close to zero .",
    "but its fba realization distorts this picture at larger angles , and the sba provides with necessary corrections .    in this paper we present experimental results and calculate fully differential cross sections ( fdcs ) within the plane wave first born approximation ( pwfba ) on proton - helium interaction at impact energies of 300 and 630 kev .",
    "both discussed above mechanisms , so and be , contribute in this case .",
    "atomic units @xmath11 are used throughout unless otherwise specified .",
    "to achieve the goals of this experiment all emitted particles have to be measured in coincidence .",
    "therefore we applied momentum spectroscopy techniques , as reactions microscopes or coltrims ( cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy ) @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed at the institut fr kernphysik at the university of frankfurt using the van de graaff accelerator . using 3 sets of movable slits ,",
    "the proton beam was collimated to a divergence less than 0.15 mrad , an size of about 0.5 @xmath12 0.5 mm@xmath13 at the overlap region with the gas jet .",
    "15 cm upstream of the target , a set of parallel electrostatic deflector plates cleaned the primary beam from charge state impurities , deflecting the primary beam slightly upwards .",
    "the h@xmath14 beam was crossed perpendicular with the helium gas jet .",
    "15 cm downstream of the target a second set of horizontal electrostatic deflector plates separate the final charge state , thus only the neutral projectiles h hit a position and time sensitive multichannel plate ( mcp ) detector , placed 3 m downsteam the interaction point , yielding the projectile deflection angle and the time zero of the collision .",
    "the main part of the beam ( @xmath15 1 na ) , which is still charged was dumped in a faraday cup .",
    "the gas jet providing the target beam was generated by helium gasexpanding through a 30 @xmath16 m nozzle with a backing pressure of 20 bar and collimated in a two stage jet .",
    "a density of @xmath17 atoms / cm@xmath13 and a diameter of 1.5 mm were achieved .",
    "the active cooling by the supersonic expansion in expansion direction combined with passive one in the perpendicular direction by the geometry resulted in a 3 dimensional cold target and a momentum uncertainty below 0.1 a.u .    at the intersection volume where proton and helium beam were intersected ,",
    "electrons and ions were created .",
    "a weak electrostatic field of 4.8 v / cm was applied to project electrons and recoiling ions onto two position and time sensitive detectors . to optimize the resolution , a three dimensional time and space focusing geometry @xcite was used for the recoil ion arm of the spectrometer .",
    "the ion were detected by a 80  mm diameter micro channel plate ( mcp ) detector with delay - line anode @xcite .",
    "the time focusing was realized using a field free drift tube @xcite , while an adjustable electrostatic lens was used to achieve space focusing .",
    "this lens was optimized by minimizing the spatial width of the lines on the detector from he@xmath14 ions created by pure capture , which have been recorded parallel to the transfer ionization events ( for an example see fig . 1 in @xcite or fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "a momentum resolution of 0.1 a.  u. was achieved in all three directions .",
    "the electrons were guided by a magnetic field ( see @xcite ) of 15 and 25  gauss and accelerated over a length of 20  cm by the same electric field in a time focusing geometry ( 40  cm additional field free drift tube ) onto a mcp detector of 120  mm active diameter .",
    "the overall spectrometer geometry , especially the ion s part was simulated using simion to gain the maximum resolution and efficiency .",
    "we reached an overall acceptance of 4@xmath19 solid angle for recoil ions up to a momentum of 10 a.u . and electrons up to 6 a.u .",
    "a three - particle coincidence ( h@xmath20+he@xmath1+@xmath2 ) was applied to record the data event by event . from the positions of impact on the detectors and the time - of - flight we can derive the initial momentum vectors of the recoil ion and the electron .",
    "the projectile transverse momentum vectors were directly measured .",
    "checking energy and momentum conservation the background was strongly suppressed during the off - line data analysis .",
    "also the overall resolution was good enough to measure the final electronic state of the h and separate events where the hydrogen was found in the ground state from where the electron was captured into an excited state . only these events , where the hydrogen is in the ground state are presented in the following",
    "as stated above , we consider the he atom as a target for the ti reaction .",
    "we follow definitions and notations given in @xcite and not repeat all conditions here . in the momentum representation in the lab frame and at very small scattering angle @xmath21 the symmetrized matrix element is given by @xmath22 @xmath23=a1+a2+a3 , \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the fast proton velocity , the transferred momentum @xmath26 , @xmath27 the electron momentum , @xmath28 the helium ground wave function , and the coulomb wave function of the final target ion @xmath29    the fdcs is calculated by the formula @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the proton mass .",
    "we display all vectors components for clarity : @xmath32 .",
    "we also remind that @xmath33 with @xmath34 .    in ( 1 )",
    "the term @xmath35 is the obk amplitude , where any trial helium wave function can be used .",
    "the amplitude @xmath36 can also be attributed to so .",
    "it describes the contribution of heavy particles interaction and was discussed in the introduction .",
    "the amplitude @xmath37 is a typical pwfba realization of the be mechanism .",
    "for calculations we use three trial helium wave functions .",
    "one is the loosely correlated @xmath38 roothaan - haartree - fock ( rhf ) function of clementi and roetti @xcite ( @xmath39=-2.8617 ) .",
    "the two others are a highly correlated function of the type @xmath40\\exp(-\\gamma_j r_{12 } ) , \\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ] which was described in @xcite ( @xmath39=-2.9037 ) , and the configuration interaction ( ci ) wave function of mitroy @xcite ( @xmath39=-2.9031 ) .",
    "300 kev and b ) @xmath41630 kev .",
    "the projectile is moving in the positive @xmath42 direction , i. e. from the left to the right .",
    "the data are integrated over all other observables , i. e. the integral over the shown distribution corresponds to the total transfer ionization cross section for the h(n=1 ) state.,width=377 ]    the experimental data at @xmath43 and @xmath44 kev , shown in figure 1 , display a noticeable peak at backward ( negative @xmath42 ) direction and a less resolved peak at forward direction ( positive @xmath42 ) .",
    "the forward peak structure has more intensity at the lower projectile energy of 300 kev , as the projectile - target interaction time is longer and therefore an additional interaction , the electron knock - off , more likely to occur .    as expected calculations with the loosely correlated wave function [ figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) ] give practically no backward peak to the electron s distribution .",
    "both highly correlated helium wave functions give very similar distributions [ figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] , which include both forward and backward peaks .",
    "however , visually they are hard to compare with the experiment .    to avoid effects of color scales , we present additionally two slices of these distributions at @xmath43 kev and fixed @xmath45 : @xmath45=0.2 in fig . 3(a ) and @xmath45=0.4 in fig .",
    "the experimental points are normalized to the theory s peak maximum along the whole distributions .",
    "first , we clearly see that both used correlated wave functions give practically the same curves .",
    "second , theory and experiment well coincide at negative @xmath42 , what clearly demonstrate that the pwfba shake - off amplitude is quite sufficient to describe the backward peak .",
    "this requires of course , the use of highly correlated target wave functions .",
    "third , we see that the theory noticeably exceeds the experimental points in the forward domain @xmath10 .",
    "it is a clear indication that the sba calculations are needed here .",
    "unfortunately , we can not provide these calculations at the moment .",
    "we finally show a comparison of the total transfer ionization cross section in pwfba theory , using mitroy helium wave function , and experiment . in figure 4",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory over a wide range of the proton energies .",
    "in conclusion , we presented highly differential theory ( pwfba ) and experimental data from a kinematical complete experiment on transfer ionization in proton - helium - collision at 300 and 630 kev .",
    "the observed splitting into forward and backward emission originates from two different contributions , the @xmath37-term ( binary encounter ) and the @xmath46-term ( shake - off ) .",
    "comparison of loosely and highly correlated wave functions for the initial state confirms the high sensitivity of the experiment to the subtle features of the initial state wave function .",
    "better agreement for the forward emitted electrons can be expected for calculations in the second order . at the same time , backward emitted electrons can be described within the first born approximation at high projectile energies .",
