    "the direct photons from relativistic heavy - ion collisions are a valuable probe of the collision dynamics at early times and provide information on the characteristics of the initially created matter once the final state hadronic decay photons are subtracted from the experimental spectra  @xcite . in the last years , the phenix collaboration  @xcite has measured the spectra of the photons produced in minimal bias au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev and found a strong elliptic flow @xmath12 of direct photons , which is comparable to that of the produced pions .",
    "since direct photons were expected to be essentially produced in the initial hot medium before the collective flow has developed , this observation was in contrast to the theoretical expectations and predictions @xcite .",
    "also more recent studies employing event - by - event hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite severely have underestimated the elliptic flow of direct photons and alternative sources of direct photons from the conformal anomaly have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to distinguish direct photons from the strong magnetic field of spectator protons ( due to the conformal anomaly ) it has been suggested to explore the centrality dependence of the direct photon @xmath13 in correlation with the elliptic flow from pions  @xcite .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed that apart from the partonic production channels the direct photon yield and primarily the strong @xmath13 might be due to hadronic sources ( such as meson - meson bremsstrahlung or hadronic interactions as @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . ) .",
    "indeed , the interacting hadrons carry a large @xmath13 and contribute by more than 50% to the measured direct photons according to the phsd calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf . also the hydrodynamics calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for a quantitative understanding of the direct photon production",
    "it is important to verify the decomposition of the total photon yield according to the production sources : the late hadron decays ( the cocktail ) , hadronic interactions beyond the cocktail ( during the collision phase ) and the partonic interactions in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . since previous transport studies have indicated that the duration of the partonic phase substantially decreases with increasing impact parameter ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) we will study here explicitly the centrality dependence of the direct photon yield together with the essential production channels and their impact on the photon @xmath13 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we will employ the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach to investigate the photon production in au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev at various centralities thus extending our previous investigations for the case of minimum bias collisions .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has provided a consistent description of the bulk properties of heavy - ion collisions ",
    "rapidity spectra , transverse mass distributions , azimuthal asymmetries of various particle species  from low super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) to top relativistic - heavy - ion - collider ( rhic ) energies  @xcite and was successfully used also for the analysis of dilepton production from hadronic and partonic sources at sps , rhic and large - hadron - collider ( lhc ) energies  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to calculate also the photon production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions from hadronic and partonic interactions within the phsd transport approach , since its microscopic and non - equilibrium evolution of the nucleus - nucleus collision is independently controlled by a multitude of other hadronic and electromagnetic observables in a wide energy range  @xcite .",
    "for the details on the phsd approach we refer the reader to refs . @xcite and the implementation of the photon production to refs .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "let us recall that the dynamical calculations within the phsd have reproduced the measured differential spectra of dileptons produced in heavy - ion collisions at sps and rhic energies ( see refs .",
    "furthermore , the dilepton production rate from the qgp constituents - as incorporated in the phsd - agrees with the dilepton rate from the thermalized qcd medium as calculated by lattice qcd ( lqcd ) .",
    "we note , additionally , that the electric conductivity of the qgp from the phsd , which controls the photon emission rate in equilibrium , is rather well in line with available lqcd results @xcite .    as sources of photon production - on top of the general dynamical evolution - we consider hadronic  @xcite as well as partonic  @xcite interactions .",
    "in the present study we extend the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite by adding an additional source of photons , i.e. the bremsstrahlung in elastic meson+baryon collisions ( @xmath4 ) . in our previous study ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we have considered the meson - meson bremsstrahlung , because it had been proposed to be important already in refs .  @xcite . at the time we had not realized the potential importance of the photon production in meson - baryon collisions",
    "however , we will see below that this process contributes considerably .",
    "the bremsstrahlung production of photons is calculated using the soft photon approximation as in refs .",
    "the soft - photon approximation ( spa ) relies on the assumption that the radiation from internal lines is negligible and the strong interaction vertex is on - shell . in this case",
    "the strong interaction part and the electromagnetic part can be separated , so the soft - photon cross section for the reaction @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the charged accelerated particle , @xmath17 is the mass of the second particle ; @xmath18 are the energy and momentum of the photon . in ( [ brems ] )",
    "@xmath19 is the on - shell cross section for the reaction @xmath20 , i.e. the elastic scattering of the two hadrons .",
    "let us point out that the resulting yield of the bremsstrahlung photons depends on the model assumptions such as the cross sections for the meson - meson and meson - baryon elastic scatterings , incoherence of the individual scatterings and the soft photon approximation .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty of up to a factor of 2 due to the unmeasured elastic scattering cross sections has to be kept in mind .",
    "the adequacy of the spa assumption has been checked in ref .",
    "we recall here that the soft photon approximation is no longer valid for high energies of the produced photons or at high @xmath21 of the meson+meson or meson+baryon collisions  @xcite .",
    "thus we have restricted our kinematics by considering only meson+meson and baryon+meson collisions with available energies @xmath21 below 3  gev .",
    "our conclusions on the centrality dependence of the direct photons are not sensitive to the actual value of the cut - off within reasonable variations .",
    "the assumption of incoherent photon production in individual hadron - hadron collisions is not applicable at very low transverse momenta of the photons .",
    "the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect is the suppression of bremsstrahlung photon emission due to the multiple scattering of the production source ( in this case meson or baryon ) during the time needed for the formation of the radiated photon . in this case",
    "the bremsstrahlung amplitudes interfere destructively . for the hadronic bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the lpm effect in the thermal medium has been calculated in ref .",
    "the suppression depends on the length of the formation zone of the photon @xmath22 , which is defined by the uncertainty principle and depends on the energy of the photon .",
    "the suppression becomes significant for photon energies below a certain value , for which @xmath22 becomes larger than the mean free path of the hadron @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "for the photon at mid - rapidity , @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , the mean free path of the hadrons @xmath25 is governed by the hadronic scattering cross section ( typically of the order of @xmath26 mb ) and the hadron density , which after the hadronization does not exceed @xmath27  @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , the suppression due to the lmp effect is expected to be important for these processes at @xmath29 gev , where , however , no data are available yet . at present",
    ", we do not include the lmp effect on the bremsstrahlung photon production in our calculations due to the lack of data at sufficiently low @xmath7 .",
    "since a new production mechanism has been added to the hadronic production channels ( the meson - baryon bremsstrahlung ) , we first check whether this addition does not lead to an overestimation of the data from the phenix collaboration  @xcite in minimal bias @xmath30 collisions in fig .",
    "[ mb ] . since the decays of mesons as late hadronic sources are less sensitive to the creation of the hot and dense medium and to its properties , they are usually subtracted experimentally from the total photon yield to access the ` direct ' photon spectrum . in our calculations of the direct photon spectrum in fig .",
    "[ mb ] the following sources are taken into account : the decays of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons ; the reactions @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; the photon bremsstrahlung in meson - meson and meson - baryon collisions @xmath3 , @xmath4 ; photon production in the qgp in the processes @xmath35 , and @xmath36 as well as the photon production in the initial hard collisions ( `` pqcd '' ) , which is given by the hard photon yield in p+p collisions scaled with the number of binary collisions @xmath37 .",
    "we find that our phsd calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the phenix data  @xcite and show a clear dominance of the hadronic production channels over the partonic channels for transverse momenta below about 0.7 gev / c .",
    "in particular , the bremsstrahlung contributions are responsible for the banana shape spectrum and the strong increase for low @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    ", this increase should be softened to some degree by the lpm effect .",
    "accordingly , especially experimental data well below 1 gev / c in @xmath7 will be helpful in disentangling the various sources .    in fig .",
    "[ mbv2 ] , we show explicitly the elliptic flow @xmath13 of direct photons in minimum bias collisions in comparison to the data and the previous centrality integrated results also for ( the green dashed line ) from the ref .",
    "note that the photons from the decays of @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons have been subtracted from the @xmath13 data by experimental methods .",
    "we calculated the direct photon @xmath13 as a sum of @xmath38 of each individual contributed channel , weighted with the channel s contribution to the @xmath7 spectrum .",
    "the considered channels are : @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; the photon bremsstrahlung in meson - meson collisions @xmath3 ; photon production in the qgp in the processes @xmath35 , and @xmath39 as well as the photon production in the initial hard collisions ( `` pqcd '' ) .",
    "the new calculations include additionally the meson bremsstrahlung processes @xmath4 and are shown by the blue solid line . the agreement with experiment",
    "has slightly improved compared to ref .",
    "the calculated results for the direct photon spectrum in au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev are presented in fig .",
    "[ 4_spectra ] for various centralities as functions of the transverse momentum @xmath7 at mid - rapidity @xmath40 .",
    "the direct photons are obtained experimentally from the total photon spectrum by subtracting meson decay photons base on measured meson yields .",
    "therefore , in this case we disregard all hadron decays except the @xmath41 photonic decays , which are subleading .",
    "the following contributions are addressed as direct photons : the decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons ; the reactions @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; the photon bremsstrahlung in meson - meson and meson - baryon collisions @xmath3 , @xmath42 ; photon production in the qgp in the processes @xmath43 , and @xmath39 as well as the photon production in the initial hard collisions ( `` pqcd '' ) .",
    "the direct pqcd contributions dominates above @xmath44 2 gev / c .",
    "the spectra of  thermal \" photons are obtained from the direct photon spectra ( channels listed above ) by additionally subtracting the photons produced in the initial hard pqcd processes .",
    "the pqcd photons are not expected to have thermal spectrum and practically give no contribution to the direct photon elliptic flow .",
    "the thermal photons in 0 - 20 % central , 20 - 40 % central , 40 - 60 % central and 60 - 92 % central au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev within the phsd approach are displayed in fig .",
    "[ 1_plot ] .",
    "we only specify the dominant channels in fig .",
    "[ 1_plot ] , i.e. the contributions from m+m and m+b bremsstrahlung as well as the qgp contribution which is seen to become low in more peripheral collisions .",
    "though the spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ 1_plot ] is obviously not exponential in the full momentum range especially due to the bremsstrahlungs channels , one may fit the spectra by exponentials in a finite transverse momentum region and define in this way an effective slope parameter or ` effective temperature ' as in the experimental analysis  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the transverse momentum spectrum of produced thermal photons is expected to give a glance at the initial temperatures reached in the collisions  @xcite , and was even used to deduce an average temperature of the qgp  @xcite .",
    "we will present here the effective temperatures @xmath8 as extracted from the calculated transverse momentum spectra of thermal photons from fig .",
    "[ 1_plot ] , addressing them as apparent inverse slope parameters @xmath8 or energy scales for the photonic radiation .",
    "the extracted ` effective temperatures ' are shown in table i at the different centralities for the transverse momentum interval 0.6 - 2  gev .",
    "the ` temperature ' defined in this way depends on the fit range in transverse momentum and should only serve as a characteristic energy scale as mentioned above .",
    "surprisingly , we find ( within error bars ) the same slope parameter @xmath8 which is significantly larger than the critical temperature @xmath45 160 mev for deconfinement .",
    "since here the dominant contributions should be related to binary bremsstrahlung channels the high slope parameters predominantly reflect the blue - shift of the photon spectra due to the collective flow of hadrons ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) which ( for phsd ) was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be well in line with experimental observation .",

    "@xmath48 +    integrating the thermal photon spectra from fig .",
    "[ 1_plot ] over the transverse momentum @xmath7 in the interval @xmath50 , we obtain the number of thermal photons ( full squares ) as a function of centrality , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ np ] as a function of the number of participants @xmath46 calculated in the monte - carlo glauber model described in ref .",
    "since only binary collision channels contribute to the production of thermal photons in our approach , their yield rises faster than @xmath46 as expected from qualitative considerations in refs .",
    "a power - law fit to our results gives approximately a scaling @xmath51 with @xmath10 1.5 .",
    "in addition we display in fig .",
    "[ np ] the scaling with @xmath46 for the partonic ( full dots ) and hadronic bremsstrahlung channels ( full triangles ) separately , which give exponents of @xmath52 1.75 and @xmath52 1.5 , respectively .    as one can see in figs .",
    "[ 4_spectra ] and  [ 1_plot ] qualitatively the contribution of the photons from the qgp is larger in central collisions while the hadronic sources contribute more dominantly in peripheral collisions .",
    "we quantify the relative contributions by plotting in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] the ratio of the number of photons produced in the qgp to the number of all direct photons ( from the qgp , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the pqcd photons ) .",
    "the contribution of the qgp photons is seen to increase with transverse momentum and reaches slightly more than 30% for the most central event bin .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio of qgp photons to the total direct photons falls rapidly with decreasing centrality and is below 10% in the most peripheral centrality bin .",
    "accordingly , minimal bias collisions are dominated by the hadronic channels that come along with a large hadronic elliptic flow @xmath13 .    in fig .",
    "[ v2 ] we provide predictions for the centrality dependence of the direct photon elliptic flow @xmath12 within the phsd approach .",
    "the direct photon @xmath13 is seen to be larger in the peripheral collisions compared to the most central ones .",
    "the predicted centrality dependence of the direct photon flow results from the interplay of two independent factors .",
    "firstly , the channel decomposition of the direct photon yield as presented by the ratios in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] changes : the admixture of photons from the hadronic phase increases for more peripheral collisions . as has been described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the phsd approach predicts a very small @xmath13 of photons produced in the initial hot deconfined phase by partonic channels of the order of 2% . on the other hand ,",
    "the photons from the hadronic sources show strong elliptic flow ( up to 10% ) , on the level of the @xmath13 of final hadrons  @xcite . accordingly , since the channel decomposition of the direct photons changes with centrality , the elliptic flow of the direct photons increases with decreasing centrality and becomes roughly comparable with the elliptic flow of pions in peripheral collisions .",
    "however , there is another ( second ) factor contributing to the centrality dependence of the photon elliptic flow .",
    "let us recall the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow for charged particles , e.g. fig.7 of ref .",
    "the @xmath13 rises almost linearly with increasing impact parameter @xmath55 at small @xmath55 , and decreases again in the most peripheral collisions .",
    "the latter decrease is a sign that the most peripheral collisions can be understood as rather a superposition of elementary collisions , with little collectivity .",
    "the elliptic flow in the most peripheral bin is low in fig .",
    "[ v2 ] , because the all the particles have little flow at this high @xmath55 .",
    "this effect is present in the phsd model as well as in the observation .",
    "the spectra of direct and thermal photons - as produced in au - au collisions at @xmath0  gev - have been calculated differentially in collision centrality within the phsd transport approach , which has been previously tested in comparison to the measured spectra and flow of photons in minimal bias collisions at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the channel decomposition of the photon spectra changes with centrality , with a larger contribution of the hadronic sources in more peripheral collisions .    as a consequence ,",

    ". moreover , the @xmath13 of the photons increases with decreasing centrality additionally due to the rising of @xmath56 with the impact parameter @xmath55 , which was observed for all hadrons ( except for the most peripheral bin ) .",
    "the increase of the direct photon @xmath56 for the two most central bins has been also indicated in hydrodynamics calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , although with slightly lower absolute values of @xmath13 .",
    "future measurements of the photon spectra and elliptic flow as a function of the collision centrality will be mandatory for a clarification of the photon @xmath13 puzzle from the experimental side and to estimate the contribution from unconventional sources @xcite .",
    "additionally , our calculations have shown that the  thermal \" photon @xmath7 spectra deviate from an exponential distribution at all centralities primarily due to the hadronic bremsstrahlung channels .",
    "the effective slopes of these spectra have been extracted in the interval @xmath57  gev and are constant with centrality within error bars . due to the non - exponential shape of the photon spectra these effective slopes depend on the fitting interval in @xmath7 , however , provide effective temperatures significantly above the critical temperature",
    "@xmath45 160 mev for the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "since in phsd the dominant contributions to the thermal photon yield are related to hadronic bremsstrahlung channels the high slope parameters predominantly reflect the blue - shift of the photon spectra due to the collective flow of hadrons ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . experimental data at low photon @xmath7 will help in clarifying the physical sources .",
    "furthermore , since only collisional channels contribute to the production of thermal photons in phsd , their yield rises faster than the number of participating nucleons @xmath46 as expected also from qualitative considerations in refs .",
