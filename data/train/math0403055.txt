    ", he proved that any @xmath7 triangulation of the boundary can be extended to a @xmath7 triangulation of the whole manifold .",
    "+ yet earlier , in 1934 - 1935 ( even before whithead s work ) cairns . '' ] ( @xcite , @xcite ) proved the existence of fat triangulations for compact @xmath1 manifolds and for manifolds with boundary having a finite number of compact boundary components .",
    "moreover , his triangulations were _ fat _ ( see definition bellow ) , something which munkres method achieved only away from the boundary ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "+ unfortunately , it seems that little interest existed during the following decades , for studying generalizations of the results above ( @xcite representing a notable exception ) .",
    "+ the interest in the existence of fat triangulation was rekindled by the study of quasiregular and quasimeromorphic functions , since the existence of fat triangulations is crucial in the proof of existence of guasiregular ( quasimeromorphic ) mappings ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and in 1992 peltonen ( @xcite ) proved the existence of fat triangulations for @xmath8 riemannian manifolds , using methods partially based upon another technique of cairns ( originally developed for triangulating manifolds of class @xmath9 ) .",
    "+ in this paper we extend munkres theorem to the case of fat triangulations of manifolds ( and orbifolds  see section 5.2 . ) with or without boundary and we show how to apply this main result in order to prove the existence of quasimeromorphic functions . our main result is the following theorem :    let @xmath10 be an @xmath11-dimensional @xmath8 manifold with boundary",
    ". then any fat triangulation of @xmath12 can be extended to a fat triangulation of @xmath10 .    where a fat triangulations is defined as follows :    let @xmath13 ; @xmath14 be a @xmath15-dimensional simplex .",

    "@xmath16 of @xmath17 is defined as being : @xmath18 the infimum is taken over all the faces of @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for the euclidian @xmath22-volume and the diameter of @xmath23 respectively .",

    "the definition above is the one introduced in @xcite . for different , yet equivalent definitions of fatness , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea of the proof of theorem 1.1 . is first to build two fat triangulations : @xmath38 of a product neighbourhood @xmath39 of @xmath40 in @xmath41 and @xmath42 of @xmath43 , and then to `` mash '' the two triangulations into a new triangulation @xmath44 , while retaining their fatness .",
    "while the mashing procedure of the two triangulations is basically that developed in the original proof of munkres theorem , the triangulation of @xmath38 was modified , in order to ensure the fatness of the simplices of @xmath38 .",
    "the existence of the second triangulation is assured by peltonen s result . +",
    "thus our main efforts are dedicated to the task of fattening the newly obtained triangulation into a new fat triangulation .",
    "the technique we employ is essentially the one developed in @xcite . +",
    "once a fat triangulation of an orientable manifold @xmath45 is provided , the construction of the required quasimeromorphic mapping is canonical ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and is based upon the so called `` alexander trick '' , which we present here succinctly ( in a nutshell ) : one starts by constructing a suitable triangulation of @xmath46 . since @xmath46 is orientable , an orientation consistent with the given triangulation ( i.e. such that two given @xmath11-simplices having a @xmath47-dimensional face in common will have opposite orientations ) can be chosen .",
    "then one quasiconformally maps the simplices of the triangulation into @xmath5 in a chess - table manner : the positively oriented ones onto the interior of the standard simplex in @xmath29 and the negatively oriented ones onto its exterior . if the dilatations of the quasiconformal maps constructed above are uniformly bounded ",
    "which condition is fulfilled if the simplices of the triangulation are of uniform fatness  then the resulting map will be quasimeromorphic .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the main techniques we employ : peltonen s method of triangulating @xmath41 and the proof of munkres theorem on the extension of the triangulation of @xmath40 to @xmath43 .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the main task of fattening the common triangulation . in section 4",
    "we show how to apply the main result in the construction of a quasimeromorphic mappings from @xmath46 to @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we propose some generalizations .",
    "peltonen s method is an extension of one due to cairns , developed in order to triangulate @xmath49-compact manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the subdivision of the given manifold into a closed cell complex generated by a dirichlet ( voronoy ) type partition whose vertices are the points of a maximal set that satisfy a certain density condition .",
