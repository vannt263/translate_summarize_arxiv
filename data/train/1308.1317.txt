    "structural materials are used in a variety of applications with widely ranging , often complex mechanical and chemical requirements . for example , a car s crumple zone must retain its shape and stability during normal operation while irreversibly deforming during a collision .",

    "potential benefits include rate and temperature dependencies that are stronger than found in non - associating glassy systems , and thermoplastic - elastomer - like response when the sticky bonds form a percolating network ( similar to that formed by the chemical crosslinks in thermoplastics ) .",
    "this response can be achieved in systems that are easily melt - processable when the sticky bonds are sufficiently weak that no such percolating network is present at processing temperatures above @xmath4 .",
    "complex , nontrivial plastic flow and fracture behavior can arise from the fact that sticky bonds behave like transient covalent bonds and produce a correspondingly transient entanglement network .",
    "the latter is of especial interest due to its potential to produce self - healing materials with enhanced fracture toughness arising from recombination of bonds that have broken during deformation , a phenomenon with no analogue in non - associating polymer systems .    analytic and quasi - analytic approaches to ap dynamics and mechanics , e.g.  refs .",

    ", it is clear that larger @xmath3 always leads to greater toughness ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : work ] ) .",
    "one interpretation of this result is that the `` stronger '' and `` slower '' systems are in the limit @xmath80 , where fracture is activated by @xmath61-dependent stretching of the covalent bonds , i.e.  the sticky bonds behave similarly to ( breakable ) chemical crosslinks and the overall behavior is rather like that of a standard ( non - associating ) thermoplastic elastomer .",

    "for uniaxial stress , for all systems the peak stress increases and the fracture strain decreases at increased @xmath82 ( thick curves ) .",
    "the former is expected due to a greater effective viscosity and reduced @xmath1 at the higher strain rates , and the latter is also expected since fracture is stress- or strain - activated .",

    "uniaxial strain again shows trends that are different from uniaxial stress .",
    "for all systems ( with the possible exception of weak / slow ) , both the peak stress and fracture strain are larger at the higher strain rate . the difference may be attributable to the greater chain - stretching at fixed @xmath61 for uniaxial strain ( affine stretching of chains leads to larger extension in uniaxial strain ) .",
    "another possible reason for the differences between the deformation protocols is that the cavitation and craze fibril formation@xcite processes occurring for uniaxial strain have no counterpart in uniaxial - stress deformation .",
    "it is interesting that the apparent fracture toughness of these systems is clearly a coupled function of thermodynamics , chemical kinetics , and deformation protocol including strain rate .",
    "however , only qualitative insights may be obtained by visual inspection of stress strain curves , and analysis is further complicated by the abovementioned competitions .",
    "we therefore turn to a quantitative , comparative study of toughness ( integrated work - to - fracture @xmath83 ) of systems with these different parameters .",

    "as expected and shown in table [ tab : wpsps ] , the toughest systems are the `` strong , slow '' systems deformed at the higher strain rate ( ss4 ) and the most brittle systems are the `` weak , fast '' systems deformed at the lower strain rate ( wf55 ) .",
    "however , these dependencies are not monotonic ; systems with weaker sbs under high - strain - rate conditions can be tougher than systems with stronger sbs deformed at low strain rates , illustrating the complexity of these systems mechanical response .",

    "the onset of sb - breaking closely corresponds to the divergence of stress - strain curves for different systems that occurs beyond the elastic limit ( fig .",

    "sticky - bond recombination , wherein a bond pair @xmath69 ( where @xmath35 and @xmath88 are distinct sticky monomers ) breaks and then reforms , is a fast stress - relaxation mechanism . while the bond is `` open '' , stress can locally relax , and the stress previously borne by the open bond is transferred to other closed bonds .",
    "this eases the onset of the mechanical instability corresponding to fracture .",
    "we find that sb recombination is important only for the lower strain rate and in systems with fast kinetics in the uniaxial stress protocol ( thin , solid curves , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sbps ] ) .",
    "these trends are expected since recombination requires a finite amount of time ( i.e.  of order @xmath27 ) , and higher strain rates and slower kinetics both cause broken @xmath69 pairs to move further away from one another before they can recombine .",
    "far more significant from the point of view of stress relaxation in these systems is sticky - bond partner exchange , wherein an @xmath69 pair breaks and @xmath35 recombines with a different sticky monomer @xmath89 .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : sbps ] , the onset of recombination corresponds to the onset of bond - breaking .",
    "the slope is similarly maximized when systems are plastically deforming ( table [ tab : wpsps ] ) .",
    "sb partner switching is most significant for `` weak , fast '' bonds and at low strain rates ( wf55 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stressstrain2 ] , these systems also display the greatest degree of plastic flow , i.e.  flow at nearly constant stress .",
    "we expect that sb partner switching is the primary mechanism of self - healing in these materials .",
    "in other words , partner switching allows for greater ductility because it allows the materials to heal themselves even when a finite strain rate is applied .",
    "the properties of thermoreversibly associating polymer melts and glasses have attracted great interest over the past fifteen years on a variety of fronts . of particular promise",
    "is the ability to control the thermodynamics and kinetics of the sticky bonds independently , e.g.  by varying the chemistry of metal - ligand groups forming the bonds@xcite .",
    "specifically , if @xmath24 is the binding energy of sticky monomers , @xmath5 is temperature , @xmath90 is a characteristic kinetic `` attempt rate '' determined by the geometry of the binding groups , and @xmath3 is the lifetime of sticky bonds , then @xmath91 . in other words , @xmath3 can be written as a product of factors controlled by thermodynamics ( i.e.  @xmath92 ) and chemical kinetics .",
    "frequency - dependent properties such as the shear modulus @xmath93 can often be scaled by these kinetic rates , i.e. systems with different @xmath93 have the same @xmath94.@xcite however , this collapse can break down when @xmath90 is comparable to the characteristic relaxation rates @xmath95 of the parent chains in the absence of sticky bonding , in a complex regime of interplay between sb and parent - chain relaxation dynamics.@xcite it is exactly this complex regime that we have studied here , with emphasis on the nonlinear mechanics of glassy systems .",
    "we have characterized the mechanical properties of model thermoreversibly associating dendrimer glasses using a hybrid molecular dynamics / monte carlo method.@xcite the short , unentangled `` y '' architecture employed here is a simple model of a dendrimer with unentangled arms ; the sticky bond network produces an entangled - like mechanical response that is not ( to first order ) architecture - specific .",
    "such glasses are of interest because they are easily melt - processable yet can show remarkably high ductility and fracture toughness .",
    "we examined the entire range of mechanical response from the elastic regime through fracture . at small strains ,",
    "all systems fall on a common stress - strain curve since sb - breaking has not yet initiated .",
    "local `` yield '' ( i.e.  the divergence of stress curves for systems with different sb parameters ) corresponds to the onset of sb - breaking and naturally occurs in systems with thermodynamically weak sbs possessing fast chemical kinetics .",
    "all systems exhibit entangled - like response@xcite at small and moderate strains because the sticky bonds act like ( transient ) chemical crosslinks . for larger strains ,",
    "mechanical strength is maximized by `` strong , slow '' ( ss ) sticky bonds , while ductility is maximized by `` weak , fast '' ( wf ) sbs because they `` partner - switch '' in a dynamical self - healing process .",
    "investigations of such healing processes during active deformation are in their infancy ; to our knowledge , this is the first time they have been reported in thermoreversibly associating glasses .",

    "strain - rate dependence studies show that these systems exhibit a complex rheology ; our systems are often , but not always , tougher at higher strain rates , but they are more ductile at lower strain rates .",
