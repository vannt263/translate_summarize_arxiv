    "graph expansion methods for statistical models have been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "they have been very helpful in studying the high - temperature behaviours and the phase transition properties of discrete models such as the ising model of ferromagnetism .",
    "some of the early efforts were carried out by brout and others @xcite .",
    "more recently , georges and yedidia @xcite found that , high - temperature expansion of the ising spin glass free energy can also be carried out under the constraints of fixed mean spin values .",
    "this later work was extended by sessak and monasson @xcite to include pair correlations of spin variables as another set of expansion constraints .",
    "the constrained graph expansion method was applied to the inverse ising problem @xcite , with the aim of inferring the microscopic interactions of a ising system based on the observed mean spin values and spin - pair correlations .",
    "for finite - connectivity binary statistical models , chertkov and chernyak @xcite showed that the partition function can be expressed as a sum of contributions from subgraphs .",
    "the first term of this expansion is identical to the partition function obtained using the bethe - peierls ( bp ) approximation .",
    "loop corrections to the bp approximation was also calculated by montanari , rizzo , and collaborators @xcite and by parisi and slanina @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the partition function expansion by chertkov and chernyak relied on a special property of ising spin variables ( see equation ( 17 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "this special property is not valid for more general statistical models , whose microscopic variables are not necessarily binary or discrete . whether the conclusion of @xcite is valid to general statistical models is still an open issue ( for models whose discrete variables take @xmath0 values , a complicated loop - tower expansion was presented in @xcite ) .    in the present contribution we first extend the results of @xcite by carrying out a very simple derivation of partition function loop series for a general statistical model defined on a graph .",
    "we do not make any assumptions on the nature of the microscopic state variable of each edge ( or vertex ) of the graph .",
    "this state variable can be discrete or real - valued , or be a vector , or even be a function itself .",
    "we show that the first term of this expansion is also identical to the bethe - peierls ( bp ) partition function , and corrections to the bp partition function come only from looped subgraphs without any dangling edges .",
    "the auxiliary probability distributions of this loop series expansion are chosen to be a fixed point of the belief - propagation equation .",
    "this particular choice makes all the subgraphs with at least one dangling edge to have zero contribution to the correction terms .    as the second main result , we present the loop series expressions for the grand partition function and higher - level partition functions .",
    "the belief - propagation equation of a statistical model may have multiple fixed points , each of which is referred to as a macroscopic state of the configuration space .",
    "if this happens , we define a grand partition function at the level of macroscopic states and perform a loop series expansion for this grand partition function .",
    "when the auxiliary probability distributions of this expansion are chosen to be a fixed point of the survey - propagation equation ( first derived through the first - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( 1rsb ) mean - field theory of spin glasses @xcite ) , the first term of this loop expansion gives the bp free energy functional at the level of macroscopic states .",
    "corrections again come only from subgraphs that are free of dangling edges . in case",
    "the survey - propagation equation has multiple fixed points , the same loop series expansion can be performed for higher - level partition functions . as a result",
    ", we obtain the higher - level bp free energy functionals and the correction contributions , and the associated message - passing equations .",
    "this work is a mathematical approach to the theory of spin glasses from the framework of partition function loop expansion .",
    "it is clear that at each replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) level of the mean - field theory @xcite the corrections to the free energy due to looped nontrivial subgraphs are neglected .",
    "this neglected correction contribution is explicitly expressed as a logarithm over a finite series in this paper . at a given level of macroscopic states we anticipate that , the magnitude of the total loop correction contribution to the free energy will be sub - linear in @xmath1 ( @xmath1 being the total number of vertices ) if there is only one fixed - point for the corresponding message - passing equation , but it will be linear in @xmath1 if there exist multiple fixed - points .",

    "loop series expressions for these local observations should be very useful in improving the predictions of the mean - field cavity theory . for a graphical model with many short loops",
    ", it is desirable to represent the system as a collection of many basic clusters in the framework of kikuchi s cluster variation method ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",

    "[ sec : ring ]    as a simple application of the graph expansion method discussed in the main text , we calculate the loop correction contribution for a model defined on a one - dimensional ring with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath1 edges .",
    "we assume that the edge state @xmath136 between two vertices @xmath6 and @xmath137 can take @xmath138 different discrete values , @xmath139 .",

    "the prior distribution @xmath143 is uniform over the @xmath138 states .    for this simple system ,",
    "the fixed point of the belief - propagation equation ( [ eq : bpfix ] ) is @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "then we have @xmath147 , and by a straightforward summation along the ring , the loop correction expression ( [ eq:20110801 - 01 ] ) is simplified as @xmath148^{n}.\\ ] ] we notice that for @xmath1 being even , @xmath149 and therefore the loop correction to the free energy [ see ( [ eq : ffull ] ) ] is negative ( the bethe - peierls free energy @xmath74 is higher than the true free energy ) .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is odd and @xmath150 , then @xmath151 and the loop correction to the free energy becomes positive ( @xmath74 is lower than the true free energy ) .",
    "this different behaviour is related to the fact that , the one - dimensional ring with an odd number of interactions is frustrated when @xmath150 .",
    "this simple example also shows that the loop correction @xmath55 decays exponentially with loop length ."
