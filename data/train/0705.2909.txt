    "in four space - time dimensions , there is no scale invariant interacting quantum field theory which contains massive particles .",
    "even if scale invariance is preserved in massless field theory at classical level , it would be broken by renormalization effect which is known as the trace anomaly . nevertheless , it is possible that at a much higher scale there exists a scale invariant sector with a nontrivial infrared fixed point .",
    "recently , it has been argued that one kind of fields , under the name banks - zaks ( @xmath13 ) fields @xcite , might appear at tev scale . at low energy ,",
    "these fields manifest themselves by matching onto a new sector called `` unparticle '' ( @xmath14 ) with a non - integral number of scale dimension @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "although the underlying structure of unparticles is still unclear , there indeed exist respectable interesting phenomena for testing unparticles experimentally . in many processes , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , the productions of these stuff",
    "might be detected by measuring the missing energies and the momentum distributions .",
    "the phenomenological studies on the unparticle effect in charged higgs decays , anomalous magnetic moments , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mixing and hadronic flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) in @xmath20 decays are carried out in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lepton flavor violation interaction is introduced to explore the phenomenology in @xmath21 . in this work",
    ", we will investigate the lepton flavor changing processes @xmath22 , @xmath23 and some other related processes .",
    "there are a number of experimental upper bounds on these processes which give stringent constraints to the effective couplings of unparticles .",
    "this can probably shed light on the internal structure of unparticles .",
    "at very high energy , the theory contains the standard model ( sm ) fields and the fields with a nontrivial infrared fixed point , called @xmath13 fields @xcite .",
    "these two sectors interact with each other by exchanging particles with a very large mass @xmath24 . below this mass scale ,",
    "heavy particles are integrated out and thus the sm particles and the @xmath13 sector interacts through non - renormalizable operators : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are local operators made up of the sm and @xmath13 fields , respectively .",
    "the renormalization effects in the scale invariant sector induce the dimensional transmutation at the scale @xmath28 . below the scale @xmath29",
    ", the @xmath13 operators match onto unparticle operators while the non - renormalizable operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonren ] ) match onto an effective interaction operator : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath6 are the scaling dimensions of the @xmath32 and unparticle @xmath33 operators respectively . the scaling dimension of unparticle field has been taken as @xmath34 in the literature .    to be more specific ,",
    "unparticles have some different characters from ordinary particles in phase space , virtual propagator , and the effective interaction with the sm particles .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that scale invariance can be used to fix the two - point functions of the unparticle operators and the propagators .",
    "the propagator of the scalar unparticle field can be written by @xcite : @xmath35|0\\rangle = i\\frac{a_{d_{\\cal u}}}{2}\\frac{1}{\\mbox{sin}(d_{\\cal u}\\pi)}(-p^2-i\\epsilon)^{d_{\\cal   u}-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the vector unparticle is assumed to be transverse , its propagator has the form @xmath36|0\\rangle = i\\frac{a_{d_{\\cal u}}}{2}\\frac{-g^{\\mu\\nu}+p^\\mu p^\\nu / p^2}{\\mbox{sin}(d_{\\cal u}\\pi)}(-p^2-i\\epsilon)^{d_{\\cal u}-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 there are other possible lorentz structures : a spinor field @xcite or even a tensor field @xmath39 .",
    "the only difference is the spin structure which has been comprehensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective interactions that satisfy the standard model gauge symmetry for the scalar and vector unparticle operators with standard model fields are given , respectively , by @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for a standard model fermion and @xmath42 are dimensionless effective couplings @xmath43 with the index @xmath44 labeling the scalar and vector unparticle operators , respectively . in principle , the coupling constants @xmath45 can be different for different flavors and are then distinguished by additional indices .",
    "for example , the hadronic fcnc via scalar unparticle , taking @xmath46 as an example , can proceed through the effective interaction term : @xmath47 where we have used the subscript @xmath48 to denote the coupling with @xmath49 and @xmath50 quark .",
    "similarly , for the vector unparticle , the effective interaction is considered as ,    @xmath51",
    "in this section , we will consider the lepton flavor violation in neutral meson decays , including @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . to be more specific",
    ", we will consider the scalar coupling in eq.([eq : scalar ] ) and the vector coupling in eq.([eq : vector ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , the vector unparticle is assumed to be transverse .",
    "thus this kind of unparticle gives zero contribution , when contraction with @xmath58 from the matrix element @xmath59 .    in the following ,",
    "we will first focus on the decay channel @xmath60 induced by scalar unparticle .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath61 reads @xmath62v(p_\\mu ) \\nonumber\\\\             & & \\times \\frac{ia_{d_{\\cal   u}}}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{\\mbox{sin}(d_{\\cal   u}\\pi ) }              \\times ( -m_b^2-i\\epsilon)^{d_{\\cal   u}-2 }             \\times i\\frac{\\lambda_{\\mu\\tau}}{\\lambda_{\\cal u}^{d_{\\cal             u}}}(-p^\\mu_b)(-if_b { p_{b}}_{\\mu})\\nonumber\\\\             & = & -m_{\\tau}\\frac{a_{d_{\\cal u}}}{2\\mbox{sin}(d_{\\cal u}\\pi)}\\frac{\\lambda_{db}\\lambda_{\\mu\\tau}}{\\lambda_{\\cal u}^{2d_{\\cal u } } }             f_b m_b^2(-m_b^2-i\\epsilon)^{d_{\\cal u}-2 }             \\times\\bar u(p_{\\tau})(1+\\gamma_5)v(p_\\mu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mass of lighter lepton @xmath63 is neglected .",
    "thus , the decay width for this decay channel can be written as @xmath64 this decay width is proportional to the lepton mass square , due to the @xmath65 current for the interaction type , which indicates this kind of process is helicity - suppressed .    as an illustration",
    ", we use the following inputs @xmath66 the experimental upper bound on the branching fraction : @xmath67 leads to a constraint on the coupling constant @xmath68 .",
    "if we take the scaling dimension @xmath6 larger , the constraint becomes less stringent , for example , the constraint for @xmath69 is obtained by taking @xmath11 . as mentioned above , the @xmath65 coupling of unparticles with the standard model fermions results in the famous helicity suppression . if other interactions are introduced such as @xmath70 , the helicity rule is invalid , which can constrain @xmath71 more strictly .",
    "the analysis can be easily generalized to other processes , such as @xmath72 .",
    "these processes can give different constraints .",
    "for example , the constraint on @xmath73 is obtained from @xmath74 . in table [ tab : mtoll ] , we collect the experimental upper bounds @xcite for these channels and their constraints on the leptonic flavor violating processes in @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath75 , @xmath57 decays . from this table",
    ", we can see the results dramatically depend on the scaling dimension of the unparticle field .    since the transversely polarized vector unparticle gives zero contribution to the neutral meson decays",
    ", there is no constraint from experiments to their effective couplings .",
    ".experimental upper bounds on @xmath76 at @xmath77 confidence level @xcite and their constraints on the effective coupling constants @xmath71 performed at @xmath78 tev and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the constraint on the axial - vector coupling constants can also be similarly analyzed .",
    "since the scalar unparticle coupling does not contribute to the @xmath81 process in the zero lepton mass limit , there is no constraint for their effective coupling from these experiments .",
    "in a short summary , we have explored the phenomenology of unparticle physics with the help of lepton flavor changing processes @xmath82 , @xmath83 and other related processes . in the zero lepton mass limit",
    ", the vector unparticle coupling does not contribute to the neutral meson leptonic decays ; while the scalar unparticle coupling does not contribute to the @xmath81 scattering processes .",
    "therefore , the experimental upper bounds of @xmath82 decays will only constrain the scalar unparticle coupling @xmath71 , which is sensitive to the scaling dimension of the unparticle @xmath6 . for the scattering process",
    "@xmath84 , there is only constraint to the vector unparticle coupling from current experiments .",
    "we also study the @xmath8 dependence of the cross section @xmath9 of process @xmath84 with different values of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath11 , the cross section is independent on the invariant mass . for @xmath12 , the cross section increases with @xmath8 .",
