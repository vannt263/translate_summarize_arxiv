    "a correlation between the lyapunov time , the time it takes for nearby orbits to diverge by @xmath0 , and the time in which an orbit undergoes a sudden transition in the solar system was first discussed by @xcite . from a study of orbits of asteroids @xcite between jupiter and saturn ,",

    "similarly , it was found that a probability density function for @xmath171 which fits the numerical data satisfactorily is given by @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 as shown in figure [ fig : zfit ] .     for the numerical results with @xmath46 .",

    "the marginal probability density functions for @xmath2 and @xmath171 are quite different to those for for the general 3-body problem .",
    "this means that the predicted density function ( [ eq : mttl ] ) may not necessarily hold for the map . proceeding as in ( [ eq : mttl ] ) , assuming the variables @xmath2 and @xmath171 are independent , the density function for @xmath1 can be determined by , @xmath183 figure [ fig : tl ] shows the numerical results for the map @xmath83 for @xmath46 .",
    "the solid curve shows the data from the experiments , and the medium dashed curve is the predicted curve ( [ eq : tlpredict ] ) where @xmath184 .",
    "note that the curve does not quite fit the data from the experiments for small @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : tlsmall ] ) .",
    "the data was then fitted to a curve of the form , @xmath185 shown by the short dashed curve .",
    "again , this failed to fit the data for small @xmath1 .",
    "it was noted that the data is better approximated by the curve , @xmath186 interestingly , this is a similar function to that which fits the numerical results for the general 3-body problem .",
    "this suggests that the probability distribution associated with the lyapunov time may not necessarily be the result of the probability distribution of survival times and the probability distribution of the variable @xmath171 .",
    "one of the results of this investigation is demonstrating a relationship between the lyapunov time and the survival time for the sitnikov problem which is similar to that for the general 3-body problem found in @xcite .",
    "this is surprising as the sitnikov problem is rather different compared to the 3-body systems discussed in @xcite . with the use of an approximate poincar map we were able to delineate regions of escape on a surface of section so as to construct initial conditions for the map . by studying the relationship between the lyapunov time and the survival time with initial conditions in distinct escape regions",
    ", we were able to analytically obtain a new functional relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 given by @xmath187 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are constants .",
    "as the @xmath45 scatter plots for the sitnikov problem are similar to the @xmath45 scatter plots for the general 3-body problem , we conjecture that the new functional relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 presented above may also be valid for the general 3-body problem .",
    "interestingly , the marginal distributions for the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath171 were found to be different than for the general 3-body problem .",
    "the reason for this is not known although it may just be that in this study we considered the entirety of the numerical results and not just large values . treating @xmath2 and @xmath171 as independent variables , we were able to derive a marginal distribution for @xmath1 which did not quite capture the numerical results .",
    "it seems unlikely though that @xmath2 and @xmath171 are independent quantities which may be why the theoretical predicted distribution @xmath188 did not quite match the numerical results . interestingly , as for the general 3-body problem , it was found that a function proportional to @xmath174 fits the numerical distribution of @xmath1 well .",
    "this may point to a more general property which may be valid for 3-body problems which experience large perturbations to an escaping mass .",
