    "samples with elongated particles saturate at a higher value of @xmath55 and also higher void ratio , as a consequence of the stronger interlocking due to the particle shape .",
    "one can therefore conclude that elongated grains are more sensitive to volumetric changes and develop a higher shear strength .",

    "we notice that @xmath55 and the void ratio @xmath48 evolve toward the same saturation value when they reach the steady state independently of the initial anisotropy due to contact and particle orientations .",
    "this independence of the initial anisotropy will be explained by studying the evolution of the internal variables in section @xmath59 .      in order to get a better understanding of what is occurring at the micro - mechanical level and to find some explanations for the macro - mechanical behavior observed in the previous section",

    "note that , so defined , the trace of the fabric tensor @xmath67 is then the number of contacts @xmath66 of the particle @xmath61 .",
    "it is also possible to define a normalized fabric tensor @xmath68/@xmath66 , whose trace is unity . finally , the mean fabric tensor for an assembly can then be defined as follows :    @xmath69    where the particle fabric tensor @xmath68 is summed over the total number of particles @xmath70 within a representative volume element ( rve ) .",
    "the trace of this tensor is the local mean coordination number @xmath71 , and therefore the normalized mean fabric tensor can also be defined as @xmath62/@xmath71 .",
    "the inertia tensor can be calculated for each particle as follows :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the density of the particles ( kg / m@xmath74 ) , @xmath75 is the kronecker delta symbol , @xmath76 runs in our two - dimensional case from 1 to 2 , @xmath77 is the differential area element , and @xmath42 is the shortest distance from the rotation axis to @xmath77 .",

    "we use in our analysis the rotation that particles accumulate during every unit increment ( @xmath117 ) of the strain variable @xmath44 in the steady state ( in our experiment we take @xmath118 = 10 and @xmath119 = 35 , i.e. in total 25 @xmath117 ) .",
    "then , we average this accumulated particle rotation for each layer of the system , and for all the considered strain increments . in figure @xmath120 ,",
    "the average accumulated rotation in the steady state for each layer and a shear velocity of 40 cm / s for isotropic and elongated particles initially oriented in vertical direction is shown .",
    "we observe a clear localization of rotations , having a peak close to the center and decreasing toward the boundaries .",
    "this distribution resembles the movement of two rigid bodies against each other on a shear band .",
    "we are also interested in the width of the shear zone , which we define here as the width of the zone with particle rotation larger than 80 @xmath121 of the maximum rotation .",
    "one can notice that there are two important differences between the two types of particles considered :    * the average accumulated rotation is lower for elongated particles , in this particular case it is 65 @xmath121 of the isotropic particles rotation .",
    "* the width of the localization zone is smaller for elongated particles ( 0.45 times the system height @xmath116 for elongated and 0.55 times @xmath116 for isotropic particles ) .",
    "these differences in accumulated rotation and relative width between isotropic and elongated particles can be explained by the frustration of movement and rotation that elongated particles experience due to the stronger interlocking among them . in this way , the localization zone ( rotation zone ) for elongated polygons becomes thinner than for isotropic ones . in figure",
    "@xmath122 the mean accumulated rotation since the beginning of the simulation for isotropic and elongated particles is depicted .",
    "notice that the mean rotation is almost twice for isotropic than for elongated particles at the end of the simulation .",
    "we also calculate the probability distribution function of particle rotation , which is shown in figure @xmath123 for both isotropic and elongated particles and @xmath44 = 35 . for isotropic particles a more uniform distribution",
    "is observed , and the maximum value is close to four complete rotations ( a complete rotation @xmath124 ) . for elongated particles the probability distribution function presents several peaks every half of rotation ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this fact indicates the strong frustration of rotation that such particles undergo during shearing , and that the typical mode of accumulating rotation is then every half complete rotation .",
    "in this paper , the influence of particle shape on the mechanical behavior of sheared dense granular media has been investigated using two - dimensional discrete numerical simulations .",
    "our results show an important influence of particle anisotropy on both the macro and micro - mechanical behavior of the granular media . it is found that for samples with isotropic and elongated particles the shear force and volumetric strain saturate at constant values reaching a steady state .",
    "these values in the case of elongated particles are higher than for isotropic particles due to the stronger interlocking between anisotropic particles .",
    "this is consequence of the geometrical effect of particle shape .",
    "furthermore , samples with elongated particles reach the same saturation value in the steady state independently of the initial orientation of the particles .",
    "this is related to the removal and reorientation of the initial inherent anisotropy ( fabric and particle orientations ) in direction of the induced shear .",
    "this has been confirmed by studying the evolution of the fabric and the inertia tensors .    the deviatoric part and the quotient of the principal components of the fabric @xmath60 and inertia @xmath88 tensors , for both types of particles , reach a stationary value independent of their initial one .",
    "this is directly related to the steady state at the macro - mechanical level .",
    "the principal directions of @xmath60 and @xmath88 present the following behavior : in the initial state of the samples , isotropic polygons present no preferred direction of contacts , however , in the case of elongated polygons the major principal component of @xmath60 is oriented along the direction of the major principal component of @xmath88 . in the steady state ,",
    "@xmath126 in the case of isotropic particles is reoriented in the direction of the major component of the stress tensor @xmath89 , but for elongated particles @xmath126 evolves following the induced orientation that particles undergo during shearing .",

    ", samples with elongated particles reach the same contact @xmath90 and particle @xmath91 global orientation in the steady state .",
    "one can then conclude that a stationary value of the principal components and principal directions of the fabric and inertia tensors is a micro - mechanical requirement for the existence of the global steady state of the medium .",
    "we also conclude that for the sheared dense granular materials here presented , the contact orientation in the global stationary state is governed in the case of isotropic particles by the direction of the major principal component of the stress tensor , and for elongated particles mainly by the major principal component of the inertia tensor ( particle orientation ) .    at the particle level",
    ", these results are clearly understood when the inertia and fabric tensor of the particles within the force chains carrying the larger forces are studied .",
    "we found that the orientation of elongated particles is associated to the stability of the packing , i.e. forces are transmitted through contacts parallel to the shortest dimension of the particles @xmath115 .    concerning strain localization and particle rotation the following",
    "is observed : the width of the shear zone and the accumulated rotation is larger for isotropic particles than for elongated particles .",
    "this results is explained by the frustration of rotation that elongated particles experience due to the stronger interlocking among them .",
    "this is clearly observed in the probability distribution function of particle rotation , where the typical mode of accumulating rotation for elongated particles is every @xmath125 .",
    "results presented in this paper lead to a better comprehension of the role of particle shape on the macro and micro - mechanical response of granular materials .",
    "it is , however , necessary to say that due to the nature of our two - dimensional analysis , a validation with a three - dimensional model would be very helpful .",
    "further work will focus on a systematic study of the influence of different aspect ratios of the particles , beyond the two limit cases here studied , on the observed phenomena .",
    "additionally , the influence of two types of particles ( isotropic and anisotropic ) as constituents of the sample on the mechanical behavior of the granular media will be investigated .",
