    "the conditions surrounding the formation of the first stars out of primordial gas has been the focus of much work over the last few years , and has recently been summarized by @xcite and @xcite . the picture that emerges",
    "is that of the first stars forming in halos with masses around @xmath8 @xmath2 due to cooling from molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the actual masses of the first stars are less well determined , but in the last five years a number of groups have employed high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations , using both adaptive eulerian codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) lagrangian codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to answer this question .",
    "this work has generally resulted in the formation of a single , relatively high mass ( of order @xmath9 ) star forming in each halo .",
    "the resulting ionization front from the first star ionizes the original cloud before any other stars can form @xcite .",
    "much of the early work focused on single objects that formed within the most massive halo in the simulation volume .",
    "more recently , some groups have explored the parameter space by conducting multiple simulations with different initial conditions and box sizes @xcite and with varying cosmological parameters @xcite . in general , a fairly consistent picture results : massive stars form in overdense regions ( halo masses @xmath10 ) less than a billion years after the big bang ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "most first star simulations have relied on a nine species chemical reaction network consisting of hydrogen , helium , molecular hydrogen , and their associated ions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this simple model is possible because big bang nucleosynthesis produced only lithium and lighter elements . while only trace amounts of h@xmath4 are present initially within the primordial gas , it forms rapidly in the high density gas within collapsing halos , and once the density exceeds @xmath12 the three - body formation process drives the fraction of molecular hydrogen to near unity .",
    "h@xmath4 has been shown to be effective in cooling primordial gas within dense halos , lowering the gas temperature to @xmath13k .",
    "however , the h@xmath4 molecule itself is a relatively poor coolant since it lacks a permanent electric dipole moment . on the other hand",
    ", the hd molecule has a permanent dipole , and cools more effectively at low temperatures ( @xmath14k ) .",
    "this has led several authors to suggest that hd will have an important effect on first star formation @xcite .",
    "however , in low - mass primordial halos , the temperature never falls below about 200k , which is required for hd to dominate over h@xmath4 cooling , and so the general consensus has been that hd is unimportant for primordial , low - mass halos .",
    "for example , @xcite included hd chemistry in 3d sph simulations of first star formation and found that h@xmath4 cooling dominated ; @xcite came to the same conclusion .",
    "@xcite recently conducted a suite of 1d simulations with full hd chemistry and found that for typical halos this is true , but that in low mass halos ( @xmath15 ) hd is formed in sufficient quantities to be as important in cooling the gas as h@xmath4 . in one run ,",
    "hd cooling lowered the temperature of the gas to @xmath16 , 3 - 4 times lower than when hd was neglected .",
    "@xcite argued that the jeans mass in such halos is lowered by a factor of 10 , implying that significantly lower mass stars will form in these regions .",
    "this is an intriguing suggestion and one of the motivations of this paper is to test this idea using full three - dimensional simulations .",
    "while there is general ( but not universal ) agreement that hd is likely to be mostly unimportant in low - mass halos that have never been ionized , a number of authors have recently pointed out that hd will form in high abundance when the gas is ionized ( as originally pointed out by * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite used one - dimensional models to follow the evolution of hii regions inside massive halos .",
    "they found that for high enough masses , the gas would re - collapse and form significant amounts of hd due to the presence of free electrons .",
    "this cooling lowered the gas temperature to the cmb temperature and so the authors suggested that low mass stars ( of order 1 @xmath2 ) could result .",
    "@xcite also looked at the impact of hd cooling in the swept up shells of primordial supernovae ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more generally , @xcite used one zone models to show that hd cooling would be important whenever primordial gas was significantly ionized .",
    "this included halos forming behind strong shocks , in relic hii regions and in high - mass halos .",
    "they showed that the cooling was sufficient to quickly reach the cmb temperature and argued that this would give rise to a population ii.5 @xcite with masses 10 times lower than traditional population iii stars .",
    "@xcite went on to suggest that these stars generated the majority of the photons that ionized the universe .",
    "in this paper , we use three - dimensional simulations to explore the impact of hd cooling in two related areas of primordial star formation .",
    "the first is to investigate more carefully the role of hd cooling in  unperturbed \" low - mass primordial star forming regions , paying particularly close attention to the suggestion of @xcite that hd may play a key role in the lowest mass halos .    in the second part of this paper ,",
    "we explore the impact that free electrons have on hd cooling in primordial halos .",
    "as noted above , ionization can occur for a variety of reasons , including relic hii regions ( the kpc - sized regions ionized by nearby primordial stars ) and shocks due to mergers with higher mass halos .",
    "we take a deliberately simple approach to the generation of free electrons and we simply ionize and heat the gas instantaneously at a certain point in the evolution of our halos .",
    "this is an approximation to more sophisticated models which follow the radiative transfer of the ionizing radiation and its heating explicitly .",
    "our method is very similar to @xcite . as discussed more fully in @xcite ,",
    "this approach has two distinct differences compared to a more realistic treatment .",
    "first , the optically thin radiative cooling approximation means that the dense gas in the core may be improperly ionized ( although if the source is in the center of halo itself , this is less of a concern ) .",
    "second , the instantaneous nature of the heating prevents the gas from being expelled from the halo .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we are able to compare the effect of hd cooling with and without ionization in similar halos , and so we can see the key effects simply and clearly .",
    "also , it is computationally faster and so we can study more cases . finally , as we will argue later",
    ", many of our key results should still apply when carried out with more realistic treatment of the ionization ( and indeed , do match other simulations where we can compare ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the simulation code and our treatment and tests of hd chemistry . in  [ sec : results1 ] , we first examine the impact of hd on primordial halos without ionization , and then in  [ sec : results2 ] we analyze the role of hd cooling in halos with ionization .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] contains a discussion of the general effects of hd cooling in primordial star formation , including predictions for the final masses of stars based on the end state of the simulations . finally ,",
    "a brief summary of the results is presented in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to follow the formation and evolution of the primordial clouds from cosmological initial conditions , we use the enzo  adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) method .",
    "it is a well - tested cosmological hydrodynamics scheme that has previously been used to study a number of astrophysical systems including clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ism @xcite , the intergalactic medium @xcite , and other applications . in particular , it has been widely used to study the formation of the first stars at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the code is detailed more fully in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and so we only summarize it here .",
    "the code relies on a hybrid particle - mesh solver @xcite , using an n - body representation for the collisionless dark matter , and an eulerian grid for the baryonic component .",
    "enzo  includes a second - order accurate piecewise parabolic method solver @xcite for solving the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the resolution of the grid is increased over the course of a simulation using the block - structured amr technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on every level and at each timestep",
    ", the state of the grid is examined to determine if any regions have exceeded critical values in baryonic density , dark matter density , or jeans length .",
    "if so , then the grid is refined in that region by adding more grid points . in this way",
    ", the most interesting regions of a collapsing medium receive the highest levels of refinement , and dynamic range large enough to correctly model the small - scale physics of cloud collapse in a cosmologically significant volume is achieved .    as our method and application",
    "is very similar to @xcite and @xcite , we describe only the changes in detail . in the next two sections ,",
    "we discuss first our enhanced chemical model and then the details of the simulation setup .",
    "the first stars formed in a chemically simplified environment consisting of lithium and lighter elements . cooling from atomic hydrogen and helium is inefficient in the low temperature ( @xmath17k ) gas within collapsing halos at @xmath18 , but should enough molecular hydrogen form it can cool the gas to t @xmath13k . @xcite and",
    "@xcite developed a chemical model for primordial gas following the evolution of the nine dominant species h , h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 , he , he@xmath19 , he@xmath21 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath22 , and e@xmath20 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the reaction rates for these species can be reduced to 19 collisional and 9 radiative processes and remain valid over a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath23k ) and densities ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the rate equations are solved using an implicit scheme based on the backward differencing formula ( bdf ) technique described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the formation of a primordial molecular cloud using this chemical model , following the cloud fragmentation and collapse until a density of @xmath25 and molecular hydrogen abundance of @xmath26 was reached . in @xcite the formation of molecular hydrogen via the three - body process was added , which extended the range of valid densities to @xmath27 and allowed the collapse to continue until the formation of a fully molecular , @xmath28 protostar .",
    "no heating term for three - body h@xmath4 formation is included , an effect which can be important for the temperature evolution of the gas at @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we focus on an intermediate regime at densities @xmath30 where the temperature is lowest .",
    "this regime is not sensitive to the high density core , and though we allow the simulations to continue to very high densities ( @xmath31 ) we do not consider the core in our analysis . in this work ,",
    "we introduce three additional species to the network : d , d@xmath19 , and hd .",
    "reaction rates for the deuterium species are listed in table  [ tab : rates ] .",
    "a total of eight reactions are considered for the deuterium species .",
    "five of the six reactions of the _ minimal model _ of @xcite are included , using the updated rates from @xcite .",
    "we neglect photoionization of deuterium as we do not consider any external radiation fields other than the cmb , which does not contribute to this rate at @xmath32 .",
    "we include two additional deuterium reactions from @xcite that were not part of the @xcite minimal model .",
    "lastly , we include deuterium ionization by collisions with electrons , for which the rate is unknown and the equivalent hydrogen rate is adopted ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cosmological deuterium abundance is taken from @xcite and is @xmath33 ( by number ) .",
    "this is @xmath34 larger than the value obtained by @xcite using wmap first - year results , though it is within the range of other d / h measurements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) .",
    "we adopt the recently computed hd cooling function of @xcite .",
    "their rate calculation includes all radiative and collisional transitions for the @xmath35 rotational levels and the @xmath36 vibrational levels .",
    "the rates are similar to previous formulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) except at high densities and temperatures ( @xmath37k ) where the collisional ro - vibrational transitions provide added cooling . from @xcite , we use their equation 5 for the low - density limit , and in the lte approximation we use the polynomial fit from their equation 4 with a density of @xmath38 ( at which point the cooling function has saturated ) . the high and low density limits",
    "are combined as @xmath39 we prevent cooling below the cmb temperature by setting the hd cooling rate to zero when the temperature in a simulation cell falls below the cmb temperature at the current redshift .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we verified the chemical network in enzo  by comparing the equilibrium abundances of the species most important for cooling against values derived analytically . while enzo   is designed primarily for cosmological simulations , it is possible to set up idealized problems and study the physics in detail .",
    "we created an adiabatic steady - state model consisting only of baryonic gas at an initial temperature and density uniformly distributed within a static ( non - expanding ) volume , and with radiative cooling disabled . using this setup , we ran simulations ranging in temperature from @xmath40 and allowed each simulation to run until the abundances of all 12 species converged .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : equilibrium ] ; the simulation data are in excellent agreement with the values derived analytically in the appendix .",
    "in addition to examining the equilibrium properties of an isothermal gas , we considered the temperature evolution of hot gas that is cooling isobarically .",
    "this simplified model approximates the conditions of photoionized gas as may be expected for relic hii regions , sne bubbles , or the shock ionized regions of colliding halos . using the setup described above , but with radiative cooling enabled and maintaining isobaric conditions by forcing @xmath41 to be a constant at each timestep , we followed the temperature evolution of the gas until a minimum temperature was reached .",
    "this test was motivated by the work of @xcite ; comparison of our figure  [ fig : isobaric ] to their figure 2 shows that similar results are obtained by two different numerical models .",
    "figure  [ fig : isobaric ] shows that hd cooling is important in ionized gas , lowering the minimum temperature to @xmath42k ( no radiative heating from the cmb was considered in this run ) .",
    "the framework for our simulations is a single box 1 comoving mpc on a side within a @xmath0cdm  universe with cosmological parameters consistent with @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46  km / s / mpc , and @xmath47 .",
    "the box is partitioned into a root grid of @xmath48 elements and initialized at @xmath49 with @xmath48 dark matter particles using an @xcite power spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath50 .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter particles is followed to @xmath51 using a low resolution run , then four of the most massive virialized halos are identified using the hop algorithm @xcite .",
    "each of the four halos represents a potential site for primordial star formation .",
    "the particles identified with each halo at @xmath51 are traced to their positions at @xmath49 , and three additional levels of nested static subgrids are defined within the root grid such that all halo particles are contained within the highest resolution subgrid at all times ( the highest resolution region has an effective resolution of @xmath52 ) .",
    "the subgrids are centered on a given halo , so that while all the simulations share the same root grid and initial conditions , the high resolution subgrids are defined independently for each .",
    "the initial conditions are then regenerated to include both baryons and dark matter . in the highest resolution subgrid the dark matter particle mass is @xmath53 and the average baryonic mass in each cell is @xmath54 .",
    "in the high resolution runs this innermost subgrid is further refined up to a maximum of 25 levels , with each refinement increasing the cell resolution by a factor of two along each axis .",
    "cells are flagged for refinement whenever the baryonic or dark matter mass in a cell is more than 4 times the resolution masses quoted above @xcite .",
    "in addition , a cell is refined if the cell width @xmath55 is less than 0.25 times the local jeans length .",
    "the dark matter density is smoothed on a scale of 1 comoving parsec in order to avoid heating of the baryons due to discreteness effects of the dark matter particles , as in @xcite . when the simulations reach the maximum refinement level ,",
    "the cell length within the highest refinement region is @xmath56 au and the gas mass resolution is @xmath57 .    for each halo ,",
    "two runs are performed , one including hd chemistry and one without , to isolate the effects of hd cooling and facilitate comparison with previous simulations where hd was not included .",
    "we test the case of primordial star formation in ionized gas as discussed in the introduction by repeating the simulations for three of the halos while ionizing the full simulation volume at @xmath58 .",
    "the first case we consider is for unperturbed primordial gas ( population iii.1 ) , beginning at @xmath49 and evolving normally until the formation of a protostar .",
    "for all eight runs ( 4 @xmath59 h2 + 4 @xmath59 hd ) a core ( proper ) density of @xmath60 is reached at @xmath61 , indicating the collapse of a protostellar seed .",
    "the h@xmath4 mass fraction quickly climbs to @xmath62 at a radius of @xmath63 pc and effectively cools the gas , lowering the temperature to a minimum of @xmath64k .",
    "as the collapse continues , the density exceeds @xmath65 and the h@xmath4 cooling rate becomes independent of density .",
    "the temperature of the contracting gas rises , and once a density of @xmath66 is reached h@xmath4 is formed rapidly through the three - body process until the core is fully molecular .",
    "the simulations are terminated when the core density exceeds @xmath67 , though we do not consider the inner core in detail and restrict our discussion to densities @xmath68 ( see  [ sec : chemistry ] ) .",
    "the inner @xmath69  au contains a fully molecular @xmath70 protostar , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "properties of the individual halos are given in table  [ tab : haloprop ] .",
    "the four halos span a factor of @xmath71 in virial mass . at the virial scale ,",
    "hd has little effect on the halo gas .",
    "the collapse to a protostar occurs at similar redshifts and virial temperatures whether hd is included or not .",
    "however , the properties of the halo gas well inside the virial radius , particularly in the region where the minimum temperature is reached , are clearly affected for two of the four halos , as is evident in the radial temperature profiles of all four halos ( figure  [ fig : h2hdcomp1 ] ) . within @xmath72 parsecs ,",
    "the h2 and hd runs for halo3 and halo4 diverge , with the hd runs having lower average densities and temperatures compared to the h2 runs .",
    "this indicates that hd cooling is effective in these halos , while for the other two halos it is not .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2hdcomp2 ] shows that throughout most of the collapse region , hd production closely follows h@xmath4 production with a factor of @xmath26 reduction in number density . the exception is a region of enhanced hd production in a spherical shell @xmath73pc from the core , corresponding to the minimum temperature . for halo1 and halo2 , the hd / h@xmath4 ratio reaches a maximum of @xmath74 in this region , and hd cooling contributes less than @xmath75 of the overall cooling , which is governed by h@xmath4 ( figure  [ fig : hdcool ] ) . on the other hand , for halo3 and halo4 the maximum hd / h@xmath4 ratio is @xmath76 and hd provides more than @xmath77 of the total cooling at densities of @xmath78 .",
    "hd cools more effectively than h@xmath4 at low temperatures ; when hd cooling is dominant the minimum gas temperature drops from @xmath79k to @xmath80k .",
    "interestingly , in the two hd - cooling halos the overall cooling is reduced , as can be seen in the ratio of the cooling time to crossing time ( figure  [ fig : h2hdcomp2 ] ) .",
    "near the temperature minimum , the cooling time rises dramatically for the hd - cooling halos , as the gas temperature is near the cmb temperature and the cooling rate goes to zero . inside this region , the temperature rises while the hd / h@xmath4 ratio drops .",
    "thus in the inner part of the cloud the gas remains cool ( @xmath81k ) but there is less hd , so that the overall cooling remains low ( @xmath82 ) and the crossing time as @xmath83 .",
    "both are locally defined within a grid cell . ] .",
    "the decrease in gas temperature caused by hd cooling actually reduces the total cooling rate , so that the gas will contract quasi - statically .",
    "an obvious difference is that the two halos with effective hd cooling have the two lowest masses ( somewhat below @xmath8 @xmath2 ) , while the two h@xmath4 cooling halos have masses around @xmath8 @xmath2 or more .",
    "@xcite noted that halos below @xmath84 collapse more slowly because h@xmath4 is not produced in sufficient quantities to efficiently dissipate the heat generated by gravitational contraction .",
    "the slower collapse allows hd to build up until it becomes a substantial coolant .",
    "this is similar to the results of @xcite , who simulated a @xmath85 halo with hd cooling that went through an extended phase of quasi - hydrostatic contraction and cooled to lower temperatures . in both of these studies ,",
    "when more massive ( @xmath86 ) halos were tested with and without hd chemistry , hd was found to have little effect .",
    "we find that halos as massive as @xmath87 generate substantial hd cooling , but do not take longer to collapse . in both @xcite and @xcite , idealized conditions of a single halo",
    "were considered , whereas in our simulations the full merger history of a halo is treated self - consistently . thus we must examine the evolution of the gas in more detail to understand why hd cooling is effective in low mass halos .",
    "we find that hd cooling in unperturbed primordial gas is a highly sensitive process .",
    "two effects combine to drive the effectiveness of hd cooling in low temperature primordial gas .",
    "first , the primary formation channel for hd , @xmath88 is endothermic by 462k , so that hd formation is favored over h@xmath4 by a factor @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "second , the hd cooling rate per molecule is greater than that of h@xmath4 below a critical temperature .",
    "this critical temperature is determined by the gas density and the abundances of h@xmath4 and hd , and is generally in the range 150 - 250k ( see the discussion and figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "should h@xmath4 cool the gas to the critical temperature , hd cooling will become important and can cool the gas even further .",
    "this results in a runaway effect , as hd is formed rapidly in the cool gas .",
    "indeed , we do not see a slow buildup of hd as in @xcite ; rather , the hd enhancement occurs rapidly in the latter stages of the collapse .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2hdevol ] shows the hd enhancement in each of the four halos , expressed in terms of the hd / h@xmath4 abundance ratio divided by the cosmological d / h abundance ratio ( both values are ratios of number densities , the cosmological d / h value is stated in  [ sec : chemistry ] ) .    at an early stage in the collapse ,",
    "when the core density is @xmath90 , the maximum hd enhancement is @xmath91 for all halos .",
    "when halo3 reaches point a , the minimum temperature is 220k , and the hd enhancement is still only 6.5 . within 0.7 myr ,",
    "point b is reached , where the minimum temperature has dropped to 150k , and the hd enhancement has jumped to 15 .",
    "halo4 undergoes a similar process , at point c the minimum temperature is 225k and the hd enhancement is 5.5 , but 0.3 myr later at point d the temperature has dropped to 100k and the hd enhancement is 14 .",
    "both halos collapse from @xmath92 to @xmath93 in @xmath94 myr , thus most of the hd enhancement occurs in less than 1% of the total collapse time .",
    "in fact , we find that hd cooling exhibits a ` critical ' nature , in the sense that either hd cooling is very important to the cooling or it is not important at all .",
    "this behavior stems from the rapid hd fractionation and the runaway effect of cooling .",
    "the conditions for effective hd cooling are then that the gas must cool by h@xmath4 cooling to the critical temperature and remain there long enough for a buildup of hd to occur .",
    "this is most likely to occur in lower mass halos .",
    "halos with large gravitational potentials have higher virial temperatures and more dynamical activity .",
    "mergers from infalling gas clumps will disrupt pockets of cool gas .",
    "lower mass halos , which collapse more uniformly , are better able to form dense pockets of cool gas where hd can form .",
    "we also find evidence for the critical nature of hd cooling by looking in detail at the low temperature gas in our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the @xmath95 plane for halo2 and halo3 at a time when the central density is @xmath96 , just before the large hd enhancement seen in two of the halos ( figure  [ fig : h2hdevol ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the lower mass halo , halo3 , has much more gas at higher densities ( @xmath97 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath98k ) than halo2 .",
    "this gas is well below the critical temperature and is cooling effectively by hd .",
    "while some gas in the more massive halo2 is just below the critical line , most of it remains above and hd cooling is not effective for this halo . our results , combined with the findings of @xcite and @xcite , suggest that a set of conditions must be met for effective hd cooling in unperturbed primordial gas , and these conditions are most likely to occur in @xmath99 halos .",
    "the second case we consider is primordial star formation in ionized regions ( population iii.2 ) . in sites of primordial star formation , molecular hydrogen forms primarily through the h@xmath100 channel , @xmath101 a reaction which is catalyzed by free electrons and thus enhanced in ionized gas .",
    "ionized primordial gas could be found in shocks from colliding massive halos , or in the photoionized regions surrounding the first generation of stars .",
    "the latter case is of particular interest , as the end state of @xmath102 primordial stars is probably either direct collapse to black holes or complete destruction in pair instability supernovae @xcite . in either case",
    "a sizable hii region will result , and as the first stars themselves form in large overdensities these fossil hii regions will host dense gas clouds that could be sites for subsequent star formation . as h@xmath4 forms rapidly in the ionized regions ,",
    "the gas cools to t@xmath103k , where hd formation is highly favored and hd cooling can drive the temperature even lower , essentially to the cmb temperature .",
    "the resulting low jeans masses imply lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "we explore the formation of primordial stars in ionized gas through the simple approach of ionizing the entire simulation volume at @xmath58 .",
    "this technique has been similarly utilized with enzo  by @xcite but without hd chemistry .",
    "while this method is not equivalent to a full treatment of radiative transfer , it does allow us to examine in detail the effect of hd cooling in ionized regions for otherwise identical halos , while being much less expensive computationally .",
    "we used three of the simulation volumes described in   [ sec : setup ] , so that the evolution to @xmath58 is identical to the unperturbed case (   [ sec : results1 ] ) , but the late stage evolution begins with a high abundance of free electrons .",
    "as previously , the simulations are performed once without hd chemistry and once with hd included .",
    "table  [ tab : flash_haloprop ] shows the properties of the halos for the ionized runs .",
    "compared to the unperturbed case ( table  [ tab : haloprop ] ) , the collapse for a given halo occurs somewhat earlier and at lower virial masses and temperatures in ionized regions .",
    "the resulting density , temperature and enclosed mass profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : flash_h2hdcomp1 ] .",
    "as in figure  [ fig : h2hdcomp1 ] , the hd simulations show distinctly lower temperatures than the h2 runs in the range 0.01 - 10 pc , but now the effect is independent of mass .    in figure  [",
    "fig : flash_h2hdcomp2 ] it is clear that the molecular hydrogen fraction is greatly enhanced over the unperturbed case as expected . the extra h@xmath4 lowers the gas temperature to @xmath104k even without hd cooling , a factor of @xmath105 lower than achieved in the h@xmath4 cooling unperturbed halos .",
    "when hd chemistry is included , it forms rapidly in the low temperature gas .",
    "this can be seen in the large bump in the hd fraction at @xmath63pc , which reaches a maximum of @xmath106 , nearly two orders of magnitude greater than seen in the unperturbed halos . as a result",
    ", the temperature is driven to the cmb floor , and hd provides @xmath107 of the total cooling in the low temperature zone ( figure  [ fig : flash_hdcool ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the radial development of the h@xmath4 and hd abundances shown in figure  [ fig : flash_h2hdcomp2 ] .",
    "moving inward from a radius @xmath103pc , the h@xmath4 mass fraction rises to a maximum of @xmath108 , and remains essentially constant until a radius of @xmath109pc . on the other hand ,",
    "the hd mass fraction steadily rises from @xmath103pc to @xmath73pc , as the temperature drops from @xmath110k to @xmath103k .    over the next decade in radius ,",
    "the temperature is roughly constant near the minimum , and the hd mass fraction remains at its peak of @xmath111 . in this region",
    "hd fractionation is nearly complete , and the hd / h@xmath4 ratio reaches @xmath112 ( figure  [ fig : flash_hdcool ] ) . at a density of @xmath113 ,",
    "the hd cooling function saturates and the temperature rises , leading to a sharp drop in the hd abundance , while the h@xmath4 abundance is still roughly constant . in the inner 0.01pc , h@xmath4 forms rapidly through the three - body process while the temperature again climbs to @xmath114k , so that the hd abundance again follows the h@xmath4 abundance reduced by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "in general , hd cooling is only important once h@xmath4 cooling has lowered the gas temperature to @xmath116k .",
    "this only occurs once the gas is already quite dense ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "thus hd cooling does not affect which halos will form stars , but it does alter the properties of the gas in the region of the temperature minimum .    for halos with effective hd cooling , the minimum temperature is not only lowered by a factor of a few compared to runs without hd , the location of the minimum is shifted to a smaller radius and hence higher densities .",
    "when h@xmath4 cooling dominates the minimum temperature occurs at a density of @xmath118 . when hd cooling dominates , the minimum temperature occurs at a density of @xmath119 .",
    "this effect is easily understood by considering the properties of the h@xmath4 and hd cooling functions .",
    "first , it is useful to assume that the gas is thermally balanced with heating due to gravitational collapse balancing radiative cooling .",
    "the gravitational energy input rate per unit volume can be approximated as @xmath120 to derive this simplified expression , we have assumed that the enclosed mass @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath122 , or alternately that @xmath123 , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : h2hdcomp1 ] and  [ fig : flash_h2hdcomp1 ] .",
    "the dynamical time @xmath124 .    over a short range in temperature",
    ", the cooling function can be roughly approximated as @xmath125 depending on whether the density @xmath126 is above or below the critical density @xmath127 .",
    "for both the h@xmath4 and hd cooling curves , @xmath128 is quite large , typically of order 3 - 5 in the interesting range . by equating these two expressions for the heating and cooling we can derive a relation between density and temperature .",
    "when we do this , we see that the temperature reaches a minimum at the critical density , where it transitions from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "the critical density for h@xmath4 is @xmath118 , while for hd it is @xmath131 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this explains the shift in the location of minimum temperature to higher densities as seen in figures  [ fig : hdcool ]  and  [ fig : flash_hdcool ] ( and tables  [ tab : haloprop ]  and  [ tab : flash_haloprop ] ) .",
    "in addition , the high value of @xmath132 explains the relatively flat temperature profiles seen in the simulations .",
    "the increase in the temperature at densities beyond the critical density ultimately leads to a shutoff of hd cooling and , as we see in the next section , important implications for the masses of the resulting stars .",
    "we have shown that hd cooling can be as important as h@xmath4 cooling for some low mass primordial gas clouds and in ionized regions .",
    "we can now examine whether hd cooling changes the nature of the collapse enough to alter the mass function of the first stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : accretion ] shows the accretion timescales for all simulations , calculated according to the shu isothermal model @xcite , where @xmath133 ( we obtain similar but noisier results using the instantaneous mass inflow rate , @xmath134 ) .    for primordial halos ,",
    "the accretion times are similar for all of the h@xmath4 cooling halos , suggesting @xmath135 stars will form after @xmath136  years of accretion",
    ". however , the two hd cooling halos accrete significantly less mass for a given accretion time .",
    "this results from the decreases in temperature and enclosed mass at @xmath137pc when hd cooling is effective .",
    "this is an important scale for star formation as this is the region at which the bonner - ebert mass is at a minimum .",
    "our results suggest that stars of @xmath138 will form , much lower than is typically seen in simulations of first generation star formation .",
    "we conclude , in agreement with @xcite , that there are two mass scales for the first stars .",
    "some ( most ) stars will form in halos of @xmath139 , cool by h@xmath4 , and have masses @xmath140 .",
    "the remainder will form in less massive halos , cool by hd , and have masses @xmath141 .    according to @xcite , metal - free stars with masses",
    "@xmath140 will produce pair - instability supernovae , while those with masses @xmath142 will collapse directly to black holes .",
    "thus hd cooling may be important in setting the mass scale of the first stars and in the later evolution of the interstellar medium .",
    "the inner regions of the ionized halos are quite similar in density and temperature , but when hd cooling is included the temperature is lower by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "the accreted mass is affected by a similar amount ; the lower panel of figure  [ fig : accretion ] shows that hd cooling lowers the expected mass of primordial stars in ionized regions from @xmath102 to @xmath143 .",
    "this mass scale agrees well with the results of @xcite , who examined the development of a protostar in a primordial hii region with sph simulations that included hd chemistry .",
    "they followed the evolution of the protostar to a central density of @xmath144 including a detailed protostellar evolution model that traced the evolution to the zero - age main sequence .",
    "they predicted that a @xmath145 star would form in the hii region , more massive than earlier simulations had predicted .",
    "our finding of a similar mass scale for three different halos suggests that while second generation primordial stars are not as massive as the first generation , they are still quite massive .",
    "we note that extrapolating a final stellar mass from estimations of the accretion rate is highly uncertain and some caution should be taken in intrepreting the stellar masses .",
    "it is unclear whether a direct relationship exists between accretion rate and final stellar mass , whether the accretion is spherical @xcite or through an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "taking these uncertainties into consideration , it is clear that hd cooling has a significant effect on both the temperature and density evolution of lower mass population iii.1 halos .",
    "the total mass within a given radius is much lower when hd cooling is effective ( figure  [ fig : h2hdcomp1 ] ) , implying stars of much lower mass will form .",
    "in ionized halos , the differences are much smaller ( figure  [ fig : flash_h2hdcomp1 ] ) , implying that in this case the resulting stars will not be significantly less massive .",
    "we do not see signs of fragmentation in projections of the inner collapse regions .",
    "we also do not see evidence for the formation of rotationally - supported disks , as @xmath146 in all our simulations .",
    "this is not a surprise , as we do not expect hd cooling to cause fragmentation ",
    "like h@xmath4 it has a steep cooling function and so is stable to thermal instabilities .",
    "in addition , as we see in figure  [ fig : flash_h2hdcomp2 ] , the cooling time never drops below the dynamical time , another important criterion for fragmentation .",
    "the results presented here depend on the accuracy of the chemical model .",
    "we showed in ",
    "[ sec : chemistry ] that the chemistry solver numerically reproduces the expected abundances in equilibrium ; however , the calculated values are only as accurate as the rates given as input . @xcite and @xcite have noted that two of the rates most strongly tied to h@xmath4 formation are also the most uncertain ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the first , the h@xmath100 channel , is less relevant to the unperturbed case but may be important in ionized regions .",
    "this uncertainty will propagate into simulations with hd , as hd primarily forms through h@xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this can be an important source of uncertainty in these calculations , and we reiterate the need for improved rate measurements and calculations .",
    "the second uncertainty discussed by @xcite is in the three - body h@xmath4 formation process .",
    "this uncertainty will not qualitatively affect our results , as the three - body process is only important in the inner core of the collapse region , where the temperature climbs up to @xmath147k and hd is less important .",
    "we did not include an analogous three - body process for hd formation , though for the same reason we do not expect this to be an important process .",
    "another source of uncertainty is in the cosmological d / h ratio . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : chemistry ] , there is a factor @xmath148 uncertainty in cosmological measurements of this value .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2hdevol ] shows that hd cooling halos undergo a rapid fractionation phase ; this is unlikely to be sensitive to small changes in the cosmological deuterium abundance . in addition , the final amount of hd enhancement differs by a factor of 2 for the hd cooling halos , yet the fraction of cooling from hd is similar for both cases ( figure  [ fig : h2hdevol ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have implemented a minimal chemical network for tracking the formation of hd in the enzo  cosmological hydrodynamics code .",
    "we have verified the network using both equilibrium and non - equilibrium tests and then applied this to the formation of primordial stars in high - redshift halos with cosmological initial conditions .",
    "we examined a range of halos under two different assumptions for the initial electron fraction . in the first case , the halos were unperturbed , with an initial electron fraction as predicted by standard cosmological evolution in the absence of ionizing backgrounds .",
    "as in previous work , the first collapsed objects form in @xmath149 @xmath2 halos at @xmath150 . in the second case , we ionized the halos at @xmath58 to investigate the impact of free electrons on the collapse .",
    "although this simple ` flash ' ionization is not a realistic description of , say , a nearby photoionizing source , it does allow us to investigate the impact of hd cooling in the presence of a source of free electrons .",
    "our primary results are as follows .    * for population iii.1 star formation in high mass halos ( roughly @xmath8 @xmath2 and above )",
    ", hd cooling is unimportant .",
    "however , for the lower mass halos in our sample there was a factor of 10 - 100 increase in the hd fraction ( compared to the high mass halos ) .",
    "this , is turn , caused hd cooling to dominate h@xmath4 cooling over the density range @xmath151 @xmath7 to @xmath152 @xmath7 ( corresponding approximately to @xmath153 pc to 1 pc , in radii ) .",
    "the hd cooling permitted gas to reach nearly down to the cmb temperature .",
    "* we found that in order for hd cooling to be important , a sufficient amount of gas needed to be at a low enough temperature and a sufficiently high density for hd to form preferentially over h@xmath4 .",
    "however , once this critical line was crossed , rapid hd fractionation coupled with runaway cooling quickly led hd to dominate the cooling rate .",
    "this requirement for lower temperatures helps to explain why low mass halos formed hd preferentially over high mass halos . * for the ionized case ( population iii.2 ) , hd cooling was important in all halos examined regardless of mass .",
    "hd cooling was efficient enough for gas to reach the cmb temperature over an even larger range of radii .",
    "* in all cases , once the density increased above the hd critical density ( around @xmath149 @xmath7 ) , the temperature began to rise again and invariably increased by about @xmath154 k , leading to the suppression of hd relative to h@xmath4 .",
    "this means that the interior solution ( @xmath155 pc ) relies only on h@xmath4 cooling and so looks quite similar to the no - hd case .",
    "in addition , no sign of fragmentation was found . * despite the fact that hd cooling led to lower temperatures ( often down to the cmb temperature ) , we found that the impact on the predicted mass accretion rates was relatively mild .",
    "it was largest for the unperturbed case , where the low mass halos were predicted to form stars a factor of six times lower than the no - hd case ( from @xmath156 to @xmath157 @xmath2 , assuming an accretion time of @xmath136 years ",
    "see  [ sec : discussion ] for a discussion of the uncertanties in accretion mass estimates ) . for the ionized case ,",
    "the predicted accretion rates were nearly identical with and without hd , leading to at most a factor of two reduction in the mass of the predicted stars forming out of ionized regions ( from @xmath94 @xmath2 to @xmath157 @xmath2 ) .",
    "these results have a number of interesting implications .",
    "first , they suggest a way for at least some relatively lower mass stars to form in primordial ( or near primordial ) halos , as some interpretations of the observed extremely low metallicity halo stars have required @xcite .",
    "however , they also indicate that hd cooling by itself will not form substantially lower mass stars ( e.g. by a factor of ten ) as some previous analytic work has suggested .",
    "in particular , we have not found any sign of a new class of population iii.2 objects ( at least for the initial conditions surveyed ) .",
    "our work suggest two avenues of future research .",
    "the first is a more careful and systematic investigation of the conditions for hd cooling in `` unperturbed '' halos . while our results indicate that hd cooling is more important in low mass halos , it is not clear how this depends on merger histories or stochastic effects .",
    "more work is required to find the fraction of halos which form via the hd channel for a complete sample of halos . in the ionized case ,",
    "our methodology for introducing free electrons was deliberately simple .",
    "it would be useful to examine more realistic ionization modalities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
