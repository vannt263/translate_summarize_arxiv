    "[ fig : zhigh ] . remarkably little sensitivity to the quark mass is observed .",

    "the unsmeared data reveals the expected shape ; a large effective quark mass in the infrared region created through dynamical mass generation , tapering to an approximate plateau in the ultraviolet region , where logarithmic corrections produce a running quark mass higher than the input bare mass , illustrated by the dot - dash line .",
    "looking at the lowest level of smearing considered , 30 sweeps , we note that the smeared results consistently have smaller error bars , particularly in the ultra - violet region , indicating short distance physics is a significant source of noise .",
    "although the instanton content of each ensemble is different , its impact on the mass function remains similar .",
    "we also note that , as expected , in the ultraviolet region the running quark mass is now barely higher than the input bare mass , due to the spoiling of short distance perturbative physics at this range . at the lowest momenta",
    ", we find perfect agreement with the unsmeared case , but as we increase momentum there is some suppression of dynamically generated mass . we attribute this to the destruction of some topological objects by the smearing algorithm , both those smaller than the dislocation threshold and those eliminated by pair annihilation .",
    "smearing also has the effect of enlarging objects , again removing dynamically generated mass from this region .",
    "indeed one anticipates a significant smearing dependence in the regime of @xmath115 .",
    "we now plot all levels of smearing , in fig .  [",
    "m1271hundred ] . even at high levels of smearing , we have maintained the qualitative shape of the mass function , although increasing smearing results in a larger loss of dynamically generated mass . as the level of smearing increases , the mass function becomes flat for lower values of momenta .",
    "this is in accord with the increase of the smearing radius , the distance within which physics is suppressed .",
    "the most dramatic shift is between the unsmeared case and 30 sweeps .",
    "this suggests that , to at least some extent , smearing has changed the mass renormalization , and so in order to acquire results with the same physical mass we must shift our value of @xmath73 for the smeared results .    in fig .",
    "[ mshifted ] we have plotted smeared results at a value of @xmath116 , chosen in order to match unsmeared results in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "this reveals that not all loss of dynamical mass generation is due to a changing mass renormalization .",
    "although we have retained the majority of long - range physics , it is clear that smearing , particularly after a large number of sweeps , has removed some important aspects of vacuum structure , creating a gap between unsmeared and smeared results .",
    "@xmath85 is plotted as a function of @xmath113 at fixed values of @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ m1694indq ] , for a quark mass of @xmath117 .",
    "this shows an approximately linear dependence on @xmath113 and thus the smearing radius .",
    "this suggests that the increase in smearing radius is responsible for loss of dynamical mass generation by removing topological objects from the lattice . at higher momenta corresponding to smaller distances",
    ", smearing has removed all relevant physics from the lattice early , and so an increase in the smearing radius has a smaller effect .",
    "higher masses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhigh ] for all @xmath114 , using the same bare mass for both smeared and unsmeared configurations .",
    "these show broadly similar results at all masses , though the gap between levels of smearing becomes clearer for larger masses , which should be more sensitive to the disruption of short distance physics .",
    "this reinforces the necessity of maintaining a high density of topological objects in the qcd vacuum and reinforcing the danger of destroying topological objects with excess smearing .",
    "the largest gap , however , remains between no smearing and 30 sweeps .",
    "we have used over - improved stout - link smearing , to reveal an underlying gauge field structure resembling an instanton liquid .",
    "after around 50 sweeps we can be confident the lattice is dominated by instanton - like objects .",
    "our calculations of the non - perturbative mass function on smeared configurations reveals that it retains its qualitative shape at even high levels of smearing .",
    "there is some loss of dynamical mass generation , increasing with smearing , which can be attributed to a thinning of the vacuum through the destruction of instanton / anti - instanton pairs by the smearing algorithm .",
    "regardless , we have shown that a gauge configuration consisting solely of instanton - like objects can accurately reproduce the majority of the long - range behaviour of the quark propagator , and thus conclude that instantons are the primary mechanism responsible for the dynamical generation of mass .",

    "<S> we quantitatively examine the extent to which instanton degress of freedom , contained within standard monte - carlo generated gauge - field configurations , can maintain the characteristic features of the mass and renormalisation functions of the non - perturbative quark propagator . </S>",
    "<S> we use over - improved stout - link smearing to isolate instanton effects on the lattice . using a variety of measures , </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate how gauge fields consisting almost solely of instanton - like objects are produced after only 50 sweeps of smearing . </S>",
    "<S> we find a full vacuum , with a packing fraction more than three times larger than phenomenological models predict . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the overlap quark propagator on these smeared configurations , and find that even at high levels of smearing the majority of the characteristic features of the propagator are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that instantons contained within standard monte - carlo generated gauge - field configurations are the degrees of freedom responsible for the dynamical generation of mass observed in lattice qcd . </S>"
