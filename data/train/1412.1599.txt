    "the discovery of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) presents a potentially transformational challenge to the understanding of the ephemeral universe .",
    "frbs are characterized by bright ( @xmath6jy peak flux densities ) millisecond - duration pulses with inferred dispersion measures ( dms ) that significantly exceed ( by factors of @xmath7 ) those expected from the galaxy .",
    "seven frbs have recently been found in surveys at @xmath8ghz with both the parkes @xcite and arecibo @xcite telescopes .",
    "the intrinsic pulse durations , with some upper limits of @xmath9  ms , imply coherent emission originating from compact regions @xcite .",
    "no additional bursts were detected in follow - up observations of one frb @xcite , although these observations were conducted six years after the event .",
    "while frbs have similar dispersion characteristics to the apparently terrestrial perytons @xcite , they can be distinguished through their isolation on the sky , preferred locations away from the bulk of the galactic disk @xcite , and broadband nature .",
    "any explanation for frbs must account for the dm excesses , @xmath10 , over the maximum line - of - sight dms predicted by models for the galactic electron density @xcite . within the milky way , the large values of @xmath10",
    "have been explained by invoking photo- or shock - ionized nebulae @xcite , or emission from deep within stellar coronae @xcite .",
    "however , these explanations are inconsistent , respectively , with constraints from h@xmath11 observations on the presence of dense ionized nebulae @xcite , and with the lack of observed deviations from the cold plasma dispersion law @xcite .    if the galactic electron density models are credible , and the frequency - dependent delays of frbs are not intrinsic to their sources , it is possible that the dm excesses are caused by frbs being extragalactic . in this case , the distances inferred from the values of @xmath10 are @xmath12gpc in the absence of significant host contributions @xcite . a menagerie of exotic extragalactic sources of frbs",
    "have been theorized , including the collapse of gravitationally unstable magnetars to black holes @xcite , giant magnetar flares @xcite , and emission from superconducting cosmic strings @xcite . despite some predictions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no astrophysical transient events at other wavelengths , such as supernovae or gamma - ray bursts , have yet been associated with frbs .",
    "the large positional uncertainties of @xmath13 at arecibo and @xmath14 at parkes have made it impossible to uniquely associate frbs with any objects .",
    "also , all frbs have hitherto been detected in post - processing of data from blind radio surveys of large areas of the sky , and have therefore not been rapidly re - observed .    here ,",
    "we report the real - time discovery of a new frb ( 131104 ) with the parkes telescope .",
    "the observations leading to the discovery of frb  131104 , which we detail in  2 , were targeted at the carina dwarf spheroidal ( car  dsph ) satellite of the milky way .",
    "an analysis of the temporal and spectral structure of the burst is presented in  3 .",
    "we describe our immediate follow - up observations in  4 , discuss the implications of our results in  5 , and summarize in  6 .",
    "we conducted our observations on ut 2013  november  4 ( mjd  56600 ) with the @xmath15-beam 21 cm multibeam ( mb ) receiver @xcite at the prime focus of the 64 m parkes antenna .",
    "the full - width , half - maxima of all beam responses on the sky are approximately 14 , although we note that the response patterns of the outer beams are mildly elliptical .",
    "data were recorded with the berkeley - parkes - swinburne recorder ( bpsr ) digital spectrometer using the same configuration used for the high time resolution universe survey @xcite . for each of the @xmath15 mb beams ,",
    "eight - bit 1024-channel spectra were integrated for 64@xmath16s intervals within a @xmath17mhz band centered on @xmath18mhz .",
    "data from each of the linearly polarized feeds were summed to form total - intensity time series .",
    "a real - time transient search pipeline , heimdall @xcite , was in operation on the bpsr computing cluster during the observations .",
    "this pipeline was used to search for isolated pulses at dms between @xmath19@xmath0pc with widths up to 0.262s .",
    "events within our search ranges that were likely caused by radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) were excised in real time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "specifically , events that were coincident in time with non - dispersed events or with ones in three or more other beams were flagged as rfi .",
    "we tested the entire observing setup by pointing each beam in turn at the bright millisecond pulsar psr j0437@xmath24715 to ensure that single pulses were being detected with the expected signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "we also carried out a 1hr observation of psr b0540@xmath269 in the large magellanic cloud , which is the most distant known emitter of giant pulses @xcite .",
    "we detected one such pulse with a snr of 7 at the known dm of 146.5 .",
    "this detection is consistent with the measured rate of approximately two per hour .",
    "we then conducted a series of 1hr observations with the central mb beam positioned on car  dsph .",
    "we disabled parallactic angle tracking for the mb feed system ; consequently the outer mb beams rotated slowly on the sky . at 18:04:01.2 ut ,",
    "approximately 21min following the start of the second observation of car  dsph , the heimdall pipeline reported the detection of a transient event at a dm of 779@xmath0pc , with a snr of 30.6 when the time series was smoothed using a boxcar of width 2.08ms .",
    "the event was detected in beam 5 of the mb receiver , which at the time was pointed at the celestial coordinates ( j2000 ) 06h44m10.4s , @xmath251d16m40s .",
    "the positions of all the beams on the sky when the event was detected are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "data recorded from beam 5 corresponding to the event are shown as a dynamic spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] .",
    "we did not identify any significant events ( with @xmath20 ) in the other beams that were were coincident in time with the event in beam @xmath21 .",
    "we also inspected the summed time series from all other beams dedispersed using the dm estimate from heimdall of 779@xmath0pc , and again found no significant coincident occurrences .",
    "no coincident events were present when summed time series were formed using pairs of beams immediately surrounding beam 5 .",
    "the background of significant candidate events with dms greater than our threshold of 1.5@xmath0pc identified with the heimdall pipeline during the discovery observation was characteristic of times not especially affected by rfi .",
    "these candidates typically had widths greater than 100ms , and an approximately log - uniform distribution of dms throughout the searched range .",
    "the event of interest was the highest - snr occurrence during the discovery observation .",
    "the detected event is similar to the frbs of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and is markedly different from peryton emission @xcite . unlike perytons , and most forms of rfi , the event was isolated to a single beam of the mb receiver .",
    "the dm estimate from heimdall is much larger than the apparent dm of any published peryton , and exceeds the expected galactic contribution along this line of sight by @xmath22@xmath0pc @xcite .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] shows evidence for the presence of emission across the entire observed frequency band , in contrast to perytons , and the small derived width from heimdall of @xmath23ms is also significantly lower than that of perytons .",
    "further , while perytons predominantly manifest during the day @xcite , our detection occurred at 05:04 local time , prior to sunrise . we hence conclude that the event is a frb , designated frb  131104 .",

    "[ fig : model ] , shows evidence for changes in both amplitude and width as functions of the radio frequency .",
    "in contrast to the modeling of the frequency - dependent delays and shapes of previous frbs @xcite , we conducted a bayesian analysis of the total intensity time series to measure the burst physical parameters .",
    "this approach allowed us to fully account for covariances between model parameters , and to obtain accurate confidence intervals for our parameter estimates .",
    "we used the bayes information criterion ( bic ; * ? ? ? * ) to perform model selection and justify the successive inclusion of free parameters .",
    "the bic for a given model is @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 is the likelihood estimate , @xmath37 is the number of model parameters , and @xmath38 is the number of measurements . if adding a new free parameter to a model reduces the bic , the new model is accepted because the likelihood increase is not simply due to the addition of the new parameter .    in",
    "order to accelerate the analysis , the data were divided into 16 sub - bands across the full 400mhz band .",
    "the two uppermost in frequency were discarded because instrumental filtering of rfi from the _ thuraya _ 3 satellite @xcite rendered them unusable .",
    "the frb was detectable by eye in all other bands .",
    "we then dedispersed the data in each of these remaining bands using the initial dm estimate of 779@xmath0pc to form @xmath39 time series , while retaining the dispersion delays between each band .",
    "adjacent samples in each time series were summed to a time - resolution of @xmath40ms . finally , through visual inspection of these time series , we selected windows of width @xmath41ms containing all the evident signal , and used these measurements as the basis for our analysis .",
    "we assessed the noise properties of the time - series by examining @xmath42s of data immediately adjacent to these windows in each frequency sub - band .",
    "we found that the values were consistent with normal distributions .",
    "we therefore measured the variances of these time series and assumed that the noise during the @xmath41ms windows was statistically identical .",
    "we considered a hierarchical series of models for the pulse morphology .",
    "the simplest model consisted of a dirac delta function impulse , dispersion - smeared at each frequency over a bandwidth corresponding to the bpsr frequency resolution of 0.391mhz .",
    "we modeled the smeared pulse profile as a gaussian function , which approximately corresponds to the frequency response of the two - tap digital filterbank , and made the conventional assumption of cold plasma dispersion . in this case , the signal intensity @xmath43 at a given time @xmath44 and frequency @xmath45 was therefore : @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a reference time at a reference frequency of @xmath48mhz , @xmath49\\ ] ] with @xmath50 , and @xmath51 finally , we modeled the fluence , @xmath52 , in four separate 100mhz bands within the full observing bandwidth ; in order of increasing frequency , we denote these fluences by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "we evaluated the six free parameters of this model by exploring the likelihood space using the _ emcee _ markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) software package @xcite . in the first row of table",
    "[ table : t1 ] we present the maximum - likelihood parameter values and their 95% confidence intervals for this model , which we term model  0 .",
    "while in our fitting procedure we expressed the fluences as snrs in each sub - band , we present them in physical units of jyms in table  [ table : t1 ] . the conversions are based on our on - sky noise temperature measurements for beam 5 of the parkes mb receiver using the unresolved radio source hydra  a , and under the assumption that the frb originated at the boresight of the beam .",
    "our fluence measurements are therefore lower limits .",
    "we extended this model by convolving the gaussian function in equation  [ eq:1 ] with a one - sided exponential with timescale @xmath57 where we initially assumed @xmath58 , and where @xmath59 is a free parameter .",
    "this allows for the pulse to be modeled with an exponential tail .",
    "this model , denoted by model  1 in table  [ table : t1 ] , significantly reduced the bic with respect to model  0 . a model where we instead replaced @xmath60 in equation  [ eq:1 ] with @xmath61^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath62 is a free parameter , did not produce as great a reduction in the bic .",
    "a model which instead included @xmath63 as a free parameter also did not produce as great a reduction in the bic .",
    "we then allowed @xmath11 to be a free parameter in addition to @xmath59 , enabling a search for scattering as an origin for the exponential tail .",
    "this caused a further reduction in the bic .",
    "the resulting parameters are also listed in table  [ table : t1 ] , and denoted by model  2 . neither the addition of @xmath62 nor the addition of @xmath63 as a free parameter further reduced the bic .",
    "we hence have no evidence for a pulse half - width , @xmath62 , at @xmath64 that is different to the dispersion smearing timescale @xmath65ms .",
    "we also have no evidence for @xmath66 .",
    "in constrast , we find strong evidence for frequency - broadening of the pulse profile .",
    "the broadening timescale is @xmath67ms at @xmath68mhz , and the index of the frequency - dependence is @xmath69 ( all uncertainties are the 95% confidence intervals ) .",
    "this is the second time that a frb has been shown to exhibit such an exponential tail ( after frb  110220 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although other studies have found that frb effective widths have similar frequency dependencies @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath11 corresponds to scattering by a kolmogorov - turbulent plasma ( in which case @xmath70 is expected ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is consistent with both scattering in a diffuse , extended medium , or in a geometrically thin region along the line of sight , or both .",
    "based on the measurements of the fluences , we find @xmath71 .",
    "this marginally inverted spectrum is broadly consistent with the analysis of frb  121102 detected with the arecibo telescope by @xcite .",
    "we note that , depending on the location of the frb within the primary beam , both hardening and softening of the spectrum can be induced .",
    "we re - observed the field of frb  131104 for three hours immediately following its occurrence , continuously rotating the receiver to keep beam  @xmath21 directed toward the frb position .",
    "we also observed the field for 6hr lengths during the subsequent three days , and for an additional 57hr at arbitrary times during the following year . with the exception of rfi",
    ", we did not detect any other event with @xmath72@xmath0pc , a width of @xmath73ms , and @xmath74 in any of the mb beams . the upper width threshold aided in rejecting the majority of spurious candidates .",
    "given the all - sky frb rate estimated by @xcite , we would have expected to see 0.5 frbs in the totality of our observations .",
    "assuming that the occurrence of frbs can be modeled as an isotropic poisson process , the probability of finding one or more frbs in all our observations is 0.4 .",
    "we also searched for periodic radio emission in the frb discovery observation , and in four 0.5hr follow - up observations of the apparent frb position spaced evenly over six months .",
    "we used standard pulsar search software to search both at the dm of the frb and at all dms @xmath75 .",
    "no periodic signal was found with @xmath74 and a period between 1ms and 10s that was not attributable to rfi .",
    "for a long - period pulsar with a duty cycle of 10% , the limiting sensitivity of our search at each epoch was 0.1mjy .",
    "frb  131104 is the first frb to be found in a targeted search for such events .",
    "car  dsph , with a moderate galactic latitude ( @xmath76 ) , is unique among dwarf milky way companions in having undergone three widely spaced episodes of star formation @xcite , and the oldest stellar population shows some evidence for tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "we chose to observe car  dsph because of the low expected galactic contribution to the dm in its direction , the presence of multiple stellar populations and possible tidal debris , the fact that the @xcite frb was detected near the small magellanic cloud , and the possibility of discovering pulsars in car  dsph in order to identify the local group contribution to dm along this sightline . despite the inferred frb rate of @xmath77sky@xmath78day@xmath78 @xcite and the total effective parkes field - of - view of @xmath79str , this event remarkably occurred within 1.5hr of the beginning of our observations of car  dsph .",
    "the location of beam 5 of the mb receiver when frb  131104 was detected ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) is also coincident with stellar debris associated with the large magellanic cloud @xcite , which is a factor of @xmath23 closer to the earth than car  dsph .",
    "however , the proximity of the half - power beam point of beam 5 to the car  dsph tidal ellipse means that frb  131104 may indeed be coincident in sky location with that galaxy .",
    "however , for frb  131104 to have originated within car  dsph , which is @xmath80kpc distant from the solar system @xcite , its source would have to be located behind , or embedded in , an overdensity of ionized interstellar gas relative to the milky way ionized halo .",
    "recent estimates for the electron density of the milky way ionized halo suggest @xmath81@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "even if the dm contribution from car  dsph is 100@xmath0pc , the intervening medium would need to have a mean electron density of @xmath82@xmath0 .",
    "such large densities have however been measured in the magellanic stream ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a part of which lies along the car  dsph sightline .",
    "frb  010724 @xcite , observed just a few degrees south of the small magellanic cloud , had a sightline that was clearly associated with the magellanic stream .",
    "further detailed observational analyses of the ionized gas content surrounding the milky way along the line of sight to frb  131104 would reveal whether there is sufficient material to associate this frb with car  dsph .",
    "pending such investigations , we can not constrain the distance to frb  131104 . hence , various possibilities for the origin of frb  131104 remain open . if frb  131104 originated from the close surrounds of the milky way",
    ", it could conceivably represent a form of giant pulse emission . the brightest such event detected from the crab pulsar with the arecibo telescope at 0.43ghz",
    "would have had a snr of @xmath83 in the absence of radio emission from the crab nebula @xcite . assuming a flux density spectrum @xmath84 for giant pulses , such an event would have been detectable with parkes at the distance to car  dsph with a snr of @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the energy distribution of giant pulses from the crab pulsar appears to flatten at the high fluence end @xcite , suggesting that even brighter pulses may yet be found than the @xcite event .",
    "such a scenario for frb  131104 will be best confirmed through an independent estimate of the line - of - sight dm to car  dsph , and through the observation of a repeat event .",
    "frb  131104 was detected in a targeted observation of the milky way satellite car dsph with the parkes radio telescope .",
    "it is possible that the large dispersion of the burst may be partly associated with circum - galactic ionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "the pulse was found to have both an an exponential tail and an inverted spectrum ; the frequency dependence of the tail is consistent with scattering in a turbulent medium .",
    "the real - time detection of frb  131104 enabled rapid follow - up with the parkes telescope , which revealed no sporadic or periodic radio emission .",
    "further analyses of circum - galactic ionized gas along the sightline to frb  131104 are required to constrain the distance and origin of this frb .",
    "we thank m.  bailes and e.  petroff for useful discussions , and the swinburne pulsar group for making their real - time single pulse detector available for this experiment .",
