    "interstellar grains scatter electromagnetic radiation .",
    "reflection nebulosities are conspicuous at optical and uv wavelengths when dust is brightly illuminated by a nearby star .",
    "dust clouds which are not unusually close to a star are illuminated by the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "finally , the starlight scattered by dust in the diffuse interstellar medium constitutes the so - called `` diffuse galactic light '' .",
    "observations of reflection nebulae , dust clouds , and the diffuse galactic light , provide a means of determining the scattering properties of interstellar grains , thereby testing models for interstellar dust .",
    "photoionization and photodissociation of molecules play a major role in interstellar chemistry , and the chemical structure of molecular clouds is therefore directly linked to the ability of ultraviolet starlight to penetrate into these dusty regions .",
    "knowledge of dust scattering properties in the ultraviolet is therefore required for realistic modeling of interstellar clouds .",
    "the nature of interstellar grains remains uncertain ( see draine 2003a , and references therein ) .",
    "this paper will examine the scattering properties for a grain model consisting of two separate grain populations  carbonaceous grains and silicate grains . with the grains approximated by homogeneous spheres with the size distributions found by weingartner & draine ( 2001 ; hereafter wd01 ) , this grain model is consistent with the observed interstellar extinction , the observed infrared emission from interstellar dust ( li & draine 2001 , 2002 ) , and the x - ray scattering halo observed around nova cygni 1992 ( draine & tan 2003 ) .",
    "the carbonaceous grains are assumed to be primarily carbon when the grains are large , but to extend down to very small sizes with the smallest grains being individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "the scattering is dominated by grains with radii @xmath4 , containing @xmath5 atoms ; carbonaceous grains in this size range are modeled using the optical properties of graphite .",
    "the primary objective of this paper is to calculate the scattering and extinction properties of this dust model at infrared , optical , and ultraviolet wavelengths , and to make these results available for use in radiative transfer calculations and for comparison with observations . the x - ray scattering and absorption properties of this grain model are the subject of paper ii ( draine 2003b ) .    the adopted dielectric functions are presented in  [ sec : dielec ] .",
    "the scattering properties of interstellar dust at optical and ultraviolet energies , as calculated for the carbonaceous - silicate grain model , are presented in  [ sec : optuv_scat ] .",
    "we show the scattering phase function at selected wavelengths from the sdss z band ( @xmath6 ) to the vacuum ultraviolet ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "scattering properties are calculated for milky way dust with @xmath8 , and also for models for dust in the lmc and smc . in  [ sec : pol ] we show the degree of polarization as a function of scattering angle for selected wavelengths .",
    "the henyey - greenstein phase function has often been used to approximate the anisotropic scattering properties of interstellar dust . in  [ sec : hg ] we show that the henyey - greenstein function has r.m.s .",
    "error @xmath9 for @xmath10 , but has larger errors outside this range .",
    "we present a new analytic phase function ( equation [ eq : newphi ] ) with a wider range of applicability , with r.m.s .",
    "error @xmath9 for @xmath2 .    in  [ sec : discuss ] we collect observational determinations of the scattering albedo and @xmath3 for dust in reflection nebulae , in dense clouds , and in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "discrepancies among these determinations are noted , and possible reasons for this are discussed .",
    "the principal results are summarized in  [ sec : summary ]",
    "as discussed by wd01 , the grain population is assumed to include very small grains with the optical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) , plus larger grains which are approximated as carbonaceous or silicate spheres .",
    "the pahs produce negligible scattering .    from the observed 3.4@xmath1 c - h stretch feature , pendleton & allamandola ( 2002 ) estimate that @xmath085% of the c is aromatic , and @xmath015% is aliphatic ( chainlike ) .",
    "the graphite dielectric function will be used to approximate the optical and ultraviolet response of interstellar carbonaceous grain material .",
    "scattering and absorption by the carbonaceous spheres is calculated using the dielectric tensor of graphite , using the usual `` 1/3 - 2/3 approximation '' ( draine & malhotra 1993 ) .",
    "the dielectric functions used here are taken from paper ii , which constructs self - consistent dielectric functions extending from microwave to x - ray energies , including realistic structure near x - ray absorption edges .",
    "the adopted dielectric functions for graphite and `` astronomical silicate '' are shown in figures [ fig : eps_c ] and [ fig : eps_sil ] .",
    "these dielectric functions are close to the dielectric functions obtained previously by draine & lee ( 1984 ) , although differing in detail .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001 ; hereafter wd01 ) obtained size distributions of spherical carbonaceous and silicate grains which reproduce the observed extinction curve both in the local milky way and in the large and small magellanic clouds . here",
    "we calculate the scattering properties of these dust mixtures .",
    "the scattering properties of a particular dust mixture @xmath11 are characterized by the differential scattering cross section per h nucleon ( ) _ x _ j da ( ) _ x ( ) _ j , a ,  , where @xmath12 is the number of grains of type @xmath13 per h nucleon with radii in @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the differential scattering cross section for grain type @xmath13 , radius @xmath16 , at wavelength @xmath17 , for scattering angle @xmath18 , for a grain illuminated by unpolarized light .",
    "the grains are assumed to be spherical , and the differential scattering cross sections are calculated using mie theory ( bohren & huffman 1984 ) , using the code developed by wiscombe ( 1980 , 1996 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f_x ] we show the differential scattering cross section per h nucleon for @xmath8 milky way dust , at the central wavelengths of sdss z  ( 8930 ) , i  ( 7480 ) , r  ( 6165 ) , g  ( 4685 ) , and u  ( 3550 ) , cousins i  ( 8020 ) and r  ( 6492 ) , v  ( 5470 ) , and the f250w  ( 2696 ) , f220w  ( 2220 ) , and f25cn182  ( 1820 ) filters for the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the scattering becomes stronger and more forward - throwing at shorter wavelengths .    to see the sensitivity to variations in the dust mixture , fig .",
    "[ fig : f_x ] also shows @xmath19 calculated for the wd01 dust mixtures for the `` average lmc '' and the smc bar .",
    "the calculated scattering closely resembles the milky way scattering , but with an overall reduction of about a factor of 4 for the lmc , and a factor of 8 for the smc , in line with the overall dust and metal abundance relative to the milky way .",

    "[ sec : new_phase_func ] . ] @xmath3 and @xmath26 for the scattered radiation .",
    "six different grain models are shown , fitted to different observed extinction curves ( see wd01 for details ) .",
    "there are considerable differences in albedo , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 among the models .",
    "in particular , the smc bar model shows a high albedo near @xmath29 , in contrast to the other five models which have a local minimum in the albedo at this frequency .",
    "this is because the smc bar model differs from the other 5 models in lacking pahs and @xmath30 graphite grains , as these are not allowed by the observed absence of a @xmath29 extinction `` bump '' .",
    "even when a grain is illuminated by unpolarized light , the scattered radiation is generally polarized .",
    "the degree of polarization depends upon both the scattering angle and the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "the fractional polarization @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are the intensities of scattered light in polarization modes perpendicular or parallel to the scattering plane .    the polarization @xmath33 of the scattered light is shown in fig .  [ fig : pol ] as a function of scattering angle @xmath18 for milky way dust with @xmath8 , at 11 different wavelengths .",
    "rayleigh scattering would have @xmath34 , with @xmath35 for @xmath36 . at long wavelengths ,",
    "the polarization has a distinct peak near @xmath37 , but even for @xmath38 the peak polarization is only @xmath39 .",
    "as the wavelength is reduced , the peak polarization declines . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the polarization becomes negative at large scattering angles ( see figure [ fig : pol ] ) , with large negative polarizations in the 120150@xmath41 region for @xmath42 .",
    "note , however , that this negative polarization occurs for scattering angles where the scattering is very weak ( see figure [ fig : f_x ] ) and therefore could be masked by scattering at other points on the sightline where the scattering contributes a positive polarization .",
    "observations of the predicted negative polarization will probably require simple scattering geometries , such as dust in a thin disk , illuminated by a single source .",
    "similar results are found for the lmc and smc dust mixtures ",
    "[ fig : pol ] . note the very large negative polarizations found for the lmc mixture for @xmath43 . from the variation of the ultraviolet polarization signature between the different grain size distributions in figure [ fig : pol ] it is apparent that the ultraviolet polarization is sensitive to the details of the grain size distribution .",
    "scattering of unpolarized incident light by a dust mixture at wavelength @xmath17 is characterized by the total scattering cross section per h nucleon , @xmath44 , and a `` phase function '' [ eq : phasefunc ] ( , ) characterizing the angular distribution of the scattered light , where @xmath19 is the differential scattering cross section , at scattering angle @xmath18 , for unpolarized incident light .",
    "the definition ( [ eq : phasefunc ] ) implies the normalization @xmath45 .",
    "isotropic scattering would have @xmath46 .",
    "the first moment = d  ( , ) of the phase function is a measure of the asymmetry between forward and backward scattering .",
    "henyey & greenstein ( 1941 ) proposed an analytic function to model anisotropic scattering for dust grain mixtures : [ eq : hg ] _ 0 ( ) =  ,   =  . with a single parameter @xmath47 ,",
    "this is a convenient analytic form that has been widely used to represent dust scattering properties in radiative models of dusty regions .    by construction",
    ", @xmath48 has the correct first moment @xmath49 , but of course @xmath50 does not perfectly reproduce the angular dependence of the real phase function @xmath51 . as will be seen below , @xmath52 is a poor approximation at both @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      at long wavelengths , rayleigh scattering prevails , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the henyey - greenstein phase function @xmath57 ; @xmath52 is 33% low at @xmath58 and 33% high at @xmath59 .",

    "this reduces to the phase function for rayleigh scattering . for @xmath63",
    "this corresponds to the phase function proposed by cornette & shanks ( 1992 ) .",
    "analytic results for this phase function are given in appendices [ app : moments ] - [ app : fixalpha ] .",
    "to determine the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath47 we can require that @xmath64 have the same first and second moments @xmath3 and @xmath26 as @xmath65 .",

    "alternatively , a given phase function @xmath51 can be approximated by summing over legendre polynomials , although the sum needs to include a large number of terms to provide a good approximation ",
    "16 terms are required for @xmath76 , and even 51 terms are insufficient for @xmath99 . at short wavelengths it may be best to simply tabulate @xmath51 and interpolate as required .",
    "the scattering properties of interstellar dust have been determined observationally by comparing the observed surface brightness of reflection nebulae with model nebulae computed with different dust scattering properties , selecting the model which provides the best match to the observations .",
    "the usual approach has been to try to determine only two grain properties  the albedo and @xmath3  by finding radiative transfer models which appear to be consistent with the observed surface brightness of scattered light .",
    "it has been customary to assume that the scattering phase function @xmath51 can be approximated by the henyey - greenstein function @xmath100 , with @xmath101    this approach has been used with ( 1 ) observations of high surface brightness reflection nebulae ( e.g. , ngc  2023 , ngc  7023 , ic  435 ) illuminated primarily by a single star , ( 2 ) observations of individual dust clouds illuminated by ambient starlight , and ( 3 ) observations of the much fainter diffuse galactic light ( the entire galaxy as a reflection nebulosity ) .",
    "figures [ fig : albedo ] and [ fig : g ] show the results so obtained from a number of independent studies , at wavelengths from the optical to vacuum ultraviolet .",
    "also shown are the albedo and asymmetry factor calculated for wd01 grain models representing average milky way dust with @xmath102 , and dust from denser regions with @xmath103 and 5.5 . while there are differences among the different observational determinations , particularly in the ultraviolet , many of the observational results are in general agreement with the albedo and asymmetry factor calculated for the wd01 grain model .",
    "for @xmath104 , the observational studies appear to be in general agreement with one another , but at shorter wavelengths the observational results are sometimes in conflict .",
    "for example , from observations of the diffuse galactic light at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found @xmath107 , while witt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found @xmath108 .    aside from genuine regional variations in dust properties , there are many factors which could contribute to such discrepancies .",
    "foremost may simply be the difficulty of observations in the vacuum ultraviolet , followed by uncertainties concerning the nebular geometry and the illuminating radiation .",
    "however , given that use of the henyey - greenstein phase function @xmath52 introduces an absolute error @xmath109 in the scattering phase function at @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hgerr ] ) , it seems possible that reliance on the henyey - greenstein phase function may contribute to the disagreements among different observational determinations of the albedo and scattering asymmetry in the ultraviolet .",
    "unfortunately , the new phase function @xmath69 is inaccurate for @xmath111 . for @xmath112",
    ", radiative transfer models should use a more accurate representation of the phase function @xmath65 . as discussed above , one possibility is expansion in legendre polynomials , although many terms are required .",
    "alternatively , it may be simplest to use tabulated values of @xmath65 with interpolation .",
    "`` inversion '' of the observational data to infer the grain properties may not be feasible ; the best approach may be to assume the dust properties [ i.e. , @xmath113 , albedo(@xmath17 ) , and @xmath87 ] based on a grain model , and then seek a dust spatial distribution which maximizes consistency with the observed surface brightness and whatever other constraints are available .",
    "failure to find agreement would suggest that the grain model may be incorrect .    applying this approach to reflection nebulae",
    "is complicated by the possibility of clumpy dust distributions , which mathis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show can produce a range of ratios of nebular surface brightness to unscattered stellar flux , depending on the detailed dust clump distribution and the viewing direction .",
    "diffuse clouds ( i.e. , the diffuse galactic light ) and externally - illuminated clouds may prove easier to interpret than bright reflection nebulae , which generally have a bright star embedded in the dust distribution .",
