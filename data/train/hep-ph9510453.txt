    "one important feature of the present work is that we consistently include the chiral loop contributions in our expansion .",

    "power - counting and large-@xmath0 consistency arguments allow a 2-loop contribution at order @xmath6 , and a non - trivial explicit calculation is required to see that such a contribution does not appear .",
    "the order @xmath5 corrections are calculable , and the result is that they are small for the relations that follow from @xmath4 symmetry alone , but the corrections to the large-@xmath0 relations are large and have the wrong sign . while this may indicate that the expansion parameters are not sufficiently small in nature to believe this expansion , we note that there are higher - order effects that are expected to substantially reduce these corrections . also , the @xmath5 corrections can be cancelled at higher orders , giving results that agree well with experiment .",

    "there are eight relations which are non - trivial consequences of the @xmath8 expansion .",
    "( that is , they do not follow from flavor symmetry considerations alone . )",
    "these relations agree well with experiment , and the remaining deviations are consistent with the expectation that the leading corrections are order @xmath22 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the expansion used in this paper . in section 3",
    ", we present our results , and section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the details of a 2-loop computation are contained in an appendix .",
    "the @xmath8 expansion for baryons has a good deal of predictive power even at subleading orders , but some aspects of the expansion are rather subtle . in this section ,",
    "we review the main ingredients of this expansion .",
    "the @xmath8 expansion makes sense only for baryons with spin @xmath23 , since baryons with spin @xmath24 have width of order @xmath0 .",
    "one conceptual subtlety in the @xmath8 expansion for baryons is that even for fixed @xmath25 the number of baryon states with given spin @xmath23 grows with @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath26 , the baryons have quantum numbers @xmath27 , and it is clear that one should identify the states of lowest spin and isospin with the corresponding baryon states at @xmath28 . when @xmath25 , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the young tableaux for the @xmath4 representation of spin @xmath29 baryons is shown in fig .  1",
    "; for @xmath30 , this representation contains many states that may be identified with a given baryon state in the world with @xmath28 . choosing any subset of the baryon states that exist for @xmath30 to represent the baryons at @xmath28 breaks the flavor symmetry explicitly .",
    "the `` extra '' states that appear for @xmath30 are important for computing chiral loops , since they can appear as intermediate states ; the contributions of all baryon states are required in order to maintain flavor symmetry and large-@xmath0 consistency .",
    "a simple way to handle this situation was pointed out in refs .",
    "the @xmath8 expansion can be carried out without selecting any subset of the baryon states for @xmath30 by writing the matrix elements in terms of few - body operators in a spin  flavor fock space that describes the baryon quantum numbers . in this formalism , the coefficient of an @xmath31-body operator is at most @xmath32 , and there is a simple classification of the operators that allows us to determine the @xmath0- and @xmath2-dependence of the matrix elements for arbitrary baryon states @xcite . for operators with the flavor numbers of a product of @xmath4 adjoints",
    ", any operator can be written as a product of 1-body operators of the form [ opcan ] a^_a x^a_b ^_a^b , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator in the spin  flavor fock space , @xmath35 is a flavor matrix and @xmath36 is a spin matrix ( either 1 or @xmath37 ) , with flavor and lorentz indices contracted in all possible ways .",
    "we keep a given operator if its matrix element in _ any _ baryon state with @xmath23 ( for @xmath38 ) is as large as the order to which we are working .",
    "it is not hard to see that the largest matrix elements are [ matcount ] since the operators have definite @xmath4 quantum numbers , this procedure keeps the flavor symmetry manifest for arbitrary @xmath0 .     without dropping terms that are subleading in the @xmath8 expansion .",
    "dropping subleading terms in the matrix elements would require us to identify specific large-@xmath0 states with the physical baryons , and would break flavor symmetry .",
    "the only ambiguity inherent in our prescription corresponds to the possibility of adding operators that are subleading in @xmath8 . ]    using these ideas , one can write an effective lagrangian for the interactions of baryons and soft pseudo nambu  goldstone bosons in which the @xmath39 chiral symmetry and the large-@xmath0 counting of matrix elements is manifest @xcite .      in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the large-@xmath0 counting rules for baryons are unaffected when the number of flavors is taken to be large ,  @xmath40 . from the point of view of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom",
    ", the reason for this is that the large-@xmath0 counting rules arise from the suppression of many - quark interactions , and this suppression is unaffected by the presence of quark loops .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the large-@xmath0 predictions for mesons , which generally rely on the suppression of quark loops and therefore are valid only in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath42 .",
    "this seems sensible , since @xmath43 in nature . in order to carry out this expansion",
    ", we must decide how to extrapolate flavor breaking ( the quark masses and charges ) to a world with @xmath44 . clearly , there are infinitely many choices , and our approach will be similar in spirit to the way we handle the additional baryon states that occur : we set up the expansion to be independent of the details of the extrapolation .",
    "we therefore consider extrapolations with arbitrary numbers of individual quark flavors @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "there are extrapolations where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , but there are also extrapolations where  @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we will evaluate the matrix elements for arbitrary @xmath51 , and keep any operator that is as large as the order to which we are working on _ any _ baryon state for _ any _ extrapolation .",
    "thus for example , we keep terms of order @xmath52 as well as @xmath53 .",
    "the predictions of the large-@xmath0 limit for baryons can be summarized by stating that baryon matrix elements obey @xmath14 spin  flavor relations in this limit . in order to consider corrections to this limit",
    ", we must take into account both the fact that @xmath0 is finite , and the fact that the @xmath4 flavor symmetry is broken by quark masses and electromagnetism .",
    "we therefore carry out a simultaneous expansion in @xmath8 and flavor breaking . in order to do this",
    ", we must decide where to truncate the expansion in the small parameters @xmath54 , @xmath3 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we will expand the @xmath10 mass differences assuming that 1n ~1n_f ~. the predictions we obtain will be viewed as predictions for @xmath55 mass differences , which are @xmath56 at leading order in this expansion .    for the @xmath12 mass differences",

    "therefore , the important point of this calculation is that this operator does not appear in the evaluation of the 2-loop graphs .",
    "as long as we are evaluating 1-loop graphs , we can use dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction , which allow us to simply drop the divergent parts . when we consider 2-loop graphs",
