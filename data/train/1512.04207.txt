    "soon after the french physicist henri becquerel first discovered the radioactivity of uranium in 1896 @xcite , some nuclear physicists began to focus their attention on the beta decays @xmath2 , where the energy spectrum of the outgoing electrons was expected to be _ discrete _ as constrained by the energy and momentum conservations .",
    "surprisingly , the british physicist james chadwick observed a _ continuous _ electron energy spectrum of the beta decay in 1914 @xcite , and such a result was firmly established in the 1920s @xcite . at that time",
    "there were two typical points of view towards resolving this discrepancy between the _ observed _ and _ expected _ energy spectra of electrons : ( a ) the danish theorist niels bohr intended to give up the energy conservation law , and later his idea turned out to be wrong ; ( b ) the austrian theorist wolfgang pauli preferred to add in a new particle , which marked the birth of a new science . in 1930 pauli pointed out that a light , spin-1/2 and neutral particle  known as the electron antineutrino today  appeared in the beta decay and carried away some energy and momentum in an invisible way , and thus the energy spectrum of electrons in the process @xmath3 was continuous .",
    "three years later the italian theorist enrico fermi took this hypothesis seriously and developed an effective field theory of the beta decay @xcite , which made it possible to calculate the reaction rates of nucleons and electrons or positrons interacting with neutrinos or antineutrinos .    in 1936",
    "the german physicist hans bethe pointed out that an inverse beta decay mode of the form @xmath4 should be a feasible way to verify the existence of electron antineutrinos produced from fission bombs or reactors @xcite .",
    "this bright idea was elaborated by the italian theorist bruno pontecorvo in 1946 @xcite , and it became more realistic with the development of the liquid scintillation counting techniques in the 1950s .",
    "for example , the invisible incident @xmath5 triggers the reaction @xmath6 , in which the emitted positron annihilates with an electron and the daughter nucleus is captured in the detector .",
    "both events can be observed since they emit gamma rays , and the corresponding flashes in the liquid scintillator are separated by some microseconds .",
    "the american experimentalists frederick reines and clyde cowan did the first reactor antineutrino experiment and confirmed pauli s hypothesis in 1956 @xcite . such a discovery motivated pontecorvo to speculate on the possibility of lepton number violation and neutrino - antineutrino transitions in 1957 @xcite .",
    "his viewpoint was based on a striking conjecture made by fermi s doctoral student ettore majorana in 1937 : a massive neutrino could be its own antiparticle @xcite . whether majorana s hypothesis is true or not remains an open question in particle physics .    in 1962",
    "the muon neutrino  a puzzling sister of the electron neutrino  was first observed by the american experimentalists leon lederman , melvin schwartz and jack steinberger in a new accelerator - based experiment @xcite .",
    "their discovery more or less motivated the japanese theorists ziro maki , masami nakagawa and shoichi sakata to think about lepton flavor mixing and @xmath7 transitions @xcite .",
    "the tau neutrino , another sister of the electron neutrino , was finally observed at the fermilab in 2001 @xcite .",
    "today we are left with three lepton families consisting of the charged members ( @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and the neutral members ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , together with their antiparticles .",
    "table 1.1 shows the total lepton number ( @xmath12 ) and individual flavor numbers ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) assigned to all the known leptons and antileptons in the standard theory of electroweak interactions .",
    "so far the nonconservation of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 has been observed in a number of neutrino oscillation experiments .",

    "the neutrinos were assumed to be massless , and hence there should be no lepton flavor conversion .",
    "just one year later , a preliminary experimental evidence for finite neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing appeared thanks to the first observation of solar neutrinos and their deficit as compared with the prediction of the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "the point was that the observed deficit of solar electron neutrinos could easily be attributed to @xmath27 and @xmath28 oscillations @xcite  a pure quantum phenomenon which would not take place if every neutrino were massless and the lepton flavor were conserved .",
    "hitherto the flavor oscillations of solar , atmospheric , accelerator and reactor neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) have all been established @xcite , and thus a nontrivial extension of the standard theory of electroweak interactions is unavoidable in order to explain the origin of nonzero but tiny neutrino masses and the dynamics of significant lepton flavor mixing .    at present the most popular and intriguing idea for neutrino mass generation",
    "is the _ seesaw _ mechanism , which attributes the tiny masses of three neutrinos to the existence of a few heavy degrees of freedom and lepton number violation .",
    "there are three typical seesaw mechanisms on the market :    * type - i seesaw  two or three heavy right - handed neutrinos are added into the standard theory and the lepton number is violated by their majorana mass term @xcite ; * type - ii seesaw  one heavy higgs triplet is added into the standard theory and the lepton number is violated by its interactions with both the lepton doublet and the higgs doublet @xcite ; * type - iii seesaw  three heavy triplet fermions are introduced into the standard theory and the lepton number is violated by their majorana mass term @xcite .",
    "after the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out , all the three seesaw mechanisms are convergent to a unique effective majorana neutrino mass operator @xcite .",
    "although a given seesaw scenario can qualitatively explain why the neutrinos may have tiny masses , it is not powerful enough to determine the flavor structures of charged leptons and neutrinos . hence a combination of the seesaw idea and possible",
    "flavor symmetries is desirable so as to achieve some testable quantitative predictions in the lepton sector .    in comparison with three lepton families , there exist three quark families consisting of the up - type quarks ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and the down - type quarks ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , together with their antiparticles .",
    "all these leptons and quarks constitute the flavor part of particle physics , and their mass spectra , flavor mixing properties and cp violation are the central issues of flavor dynamics . in this review article",
    "we shall focus on the lepton flavors , especially the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry in the neutrino sector and its striking impacts on the phenomenology of neutrino physics .",
    "since noether s theorem was first published in 1918 @xcite , symmetries have been playing a very crucial role in understanding the fundamental laws of nature .",
    "in fact , symmetries are so powerful that they can help simplify the complicated problems , classify the intricate systems , pin down the conservation laws and even determine the dynamics of interactions . in elementary particle physics",
    "there are many successful examples of this kind , such as the continuous space - time translation symmetries , the @xmath35 quark flavor symmetry and the @xmath36 gauge symmetries .",
    "historically these examples led us to the momentum and energy conservation laws , the quark model and the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions , respectively @xcite .",
    "the original symmetries in a given theory may either keep exact or be broken , so as to make our description of the relevant phenomena consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "for instance , the electromagnetic @xmath37 gauge symmetry , the strong @xmath38 gauge symmetry and the continuous space - time translation symmetries are all exact ; but the @xmath35 quark flavor symmetry , the electroweak @xmath39 gauge symmetry and the p and cp symmetries in weak interactions must be broken .",
    "that is why exploring new symmetries and studying possible symmetry - breaking effects have been one of the main streams in particle physics , normally from lower energies to higher energies .",
    "although the sm has proved to be very successful in describing the phenomena of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions , it is by no means a complete theory .",
    "the flavor part of this theory is particularly unsatisfactory , because it involves many free parameters but still can not provide any solution to a number of burning problems , such as the origin of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing , the baryon number asymmetry of the universe and the nature of cold or warm dark matter . to go beyond the sm in this connection",
    ", flavor symmetries are expected to serve for a powerful guideline .",
    "flavor symmetries can be either abelian or non - abelian , either local or global , either continuous or discrete , and either spontaneously broken or explicitly broken .",
    "all these possibilities have been extensively explored in the past few decades , so as to explain the observed lepton and quark mass spectra and the observed flavor mixing patterns @xcite .",
    "given the peculiar pattern of lepton flavor mixing which is suggestive of a constant unitary matrix with some special entities ( e.g. , @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) , a lot of attention has been paid to the global and discrete flavor symmetry groups in the model building exercises .",
    "the advantages of such a choice are obvious at least in the following aspects : ( a ) the model does not involve any goldstone bosons or additional gauge bosons which may mediate harmful flavor - changing - neutral - current processes ; ( b ) the discrete group may come from some string compactifications or be embedded in a continuous symmetry group ; ( c ) the model contains no family - dependent d - terms contributing to the sfermion masses if it is built in a supersymmetric framework .",
    "although many discrete flavor symmetry groups have been taken into account in building viable neutrino mass models , it remains unclear which one can finally stand out as the unique basis of the true flavor dynamics of leptons and quarks .",
    "but it turns out to be clear that any promising discrete flavor symmetry group in the neutrino sector has to accommodate the simplest @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry  a sort of @xmath43 transformation symmetry with respect to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 neutrinos , because the latter has convincingly revealed itself through the currently available neutrino oscillation data ( as one can see in the next section ) . in other words",
    ", a partial or approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry must be behind the observed pattern of the @xmath44 pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath45 @xcite , and thus it may serve as an especially useful low - energy window to look into the underlying structures of lepton flavors at either the electroweak scale or superhigh - energy scales .",
    "it is just this observation that motivates us to review what we have learnt from    * the @xmath0-@xmath1 _ permutation _ symmetry  the neutrino mass term is unchanged under the transformations @xmath46 * the @xmath0-@xmath1 _ reflection _ symmetry  the neutrino mass term keeps unchanged under the transformations @xmath47    where the superscript ",
    "@xmath30 \" denotes the charge conjugation of the relevant neutrino field , and to explore their interesting implications and consequences on various aspects of neutrino phenomenology .",
    "in particular , we stress that slight or soft breaking of the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry is expected to help resolve the octant of the largest neutrino mixing angle @xmath48 and even the quadrant of the cp - violating phase @xmath49 in the standard parametrization of the pmns matrix @xmath45 @xcite , which consists of three rotation angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath48 ) and one ( @xmath49 in the dirac case ) or three ( @xmath49 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 in the majorana case ) cp - violating phases .",
    "it may also offer a straightforward link between the neutrino mass spectrum and the lepton flavor mixing pattern .",
    "all these issues are very important on the theoretical side and highly concerned in the ongoing and upcoming neutrino experiments .",
    "the remaining parts of this review paper are organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to the phenomenology of lepton flavor mixing and neutrino oscillations , followed by a short description of the main outcomes of various solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments . in the three - flavor scheme a global analysis of current experimental data",
    "leads us to a preliminary pattern of lepton flavor mixing , which exhibits an approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "section 3 is devoted to an overview of the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry of the majorana neutrino mass matrix and its connection with the flavor mixing parameters .",
    "two kinds of symmetries , the @xmath0-@xmath1 _ permutation _ symmetry and the @xmath0-@xmath1 _ reflection _ symmetry , will be classified and discussed .",
    "the typical and instructive ways to slightly break the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry are introduced . in particular ,",
    "the effects of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking induced by radiative corrections are described in some detail .",
    "the contribution of the charged - lepton sector to lepton flavor mixing is also discussed . in section 4",
    "we turn to some larger discrete flavor symmetry groups to illustrate how the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry can naturally arise as a residual symmetry .",
    "both the bottom - up approach and the top - down approach will be described in this connection . in section 5",
    "we concentrate on the strategies of model building with the help of the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation or reflection symmetry .",
    "a combination of the seesaw mechanism and the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry is taken into account , and the relationship between the friedberg - lee symmetry and the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry is explored .",
    "we also comment on the model - building exercises associated with the light sterile neutrinos .",
    "section 6 is devoted to some phenomenological consequences of the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry on some interesting topics in neutrino physics , including neutrino oscillations in terrestrial matter , flavor distributions of the ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos at neutrino telescopes , a possible connection between the leptogenesis and low - energy cp violation , and a likely unified flavor texture of leptons and quarks .",
    "the concluding remarks and an outlook are finally made in section 7 .",
    "to see why an approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry is behind the observed pattern of the pmns lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath45 , let us first introduce some basics about neutrino mixing and flavor oscillations and then discuss current experimental constraints on the structure of @xmath45 .",
    "just similar to quark flavor mixing , lepton flavor mixing can also take place provided leptonic weak charged - current interactions and yukawa interactions coexist in a simple extension of the sm .",

    "@xmath56 \" denotes the flavor eigenstate of a charged lepton .",
    "the leptonic yukawa interactions are expected to be responsible for the mass generation of both charged leptons and neutrinos after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , although the origin of neutrino masses is very likely to involve some new degrees of freedom and lepton number violation @xcite . without going into details of a specific neutrino mass model , here",
    "we assume massive neutrinos to be the majorana particles and write out the effective lepton mass terms as follows : @xmath57 with @xmath58 being symmetric and @xmath59 being arbitrary .",
    "given the unitary matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath58 and @xmath62 can be diagonalized through the transformations @xmath63 then it is possible to reexpress @xmath64 in terms of the mass eigenstates of charged leptons and neutrinos : @xmath65 in doing so , one must consistently reexpress @xmath66 in terms of the relevant mass eigenstates : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is just the unitary pmns matrix which describes the strength of lepton flavor mixing in weak interactions .",
    "is really unitary or not actually depends on the mechanism of neutrino mass generation . in the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite , for instance , the mixing between light and heavy majorana neutrinos leads to tiny unitarity - violating effects for @xmath45 itself .",
    "however , the unitarity of @xmath45 has been tested at the percent level @xcite , and thus it makes sense to assume @xmath45 to be exactly unitary for the time being . ] in a commonly chosen basis where the flavor eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates , the flavor eigenstates of three neutrinos can be expressed as @xmath69 the nine elements of @xmath45 can be parameterized in terms of three rotation angles and three cp - violating phases .",
    "for example , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) . to be more explicit , @xmath78 in which @xmath79 without loss of generality , the three mixing angles are all arranged to lie in the first quadrant , while @xmath49 may vary from @xmath20 to @xmath80 .",
    "the fact that the elements of @xmath81 in its first row and third column are very simple functions of the flavor mixing angles makes the latter have straightforward relations with the amplitudes of solar ( @xmath50 ) , reactor ( @xmath51 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath48 ) neutrino oscillations , respectively @xcite . in this parametrization @xmath49",
    "is usually referred to as the  dirac \" phase , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the majorana phases which have nothing to do with neutrino oscillations .",
    "if massive neutrinos were the dirac particles , one would simply forget the majorana phase matrix @xmath82 . throughout this review we mainly concentrate on the majorana neutrinos , because they are well motivated from a theoretical point of view .",
    "then the symmetric majorana neutrino mass matrix can be reconstructed in terms of the neutrino masses @xmath83 ( for @xmath84 ) and the pmns matrix @xmath45 in the chosen flavor basis : @xmath85 in a specific neutrino mass model which is able to fix the texture of @xmath58 , one may reversely obtain some testable predictions for the neutrino masses and flavor mixing parameters .",
    "@xmath66 in eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) tells us that a @xmath86 neutrino flavor can be produced from the @xmath87 interaction , and a @xmath88 neutrino flavor can be detected through the @xmath89 interaction ( for @xmath90 ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for the propagation of @xmath91 in vacuum is expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the neutrino beam energy , and the majorana phase matrix @xmath82 has been cancelled .",
    "thanks to a quintessentially quantum - mechanical effect , the @xmath94 oscillation happens if the @xmath91 beam travels a proper distance @xmath12 .",
    "the probability of such a flavor oscillation is given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the unitarity of the pmns matrix @xmath45 leads us to @xmath100 with @xmath101 being the so - called jarlskog invariant @xcite , which is a universal measure of leptonic cp and t violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the probability of @xmath102 oscillations can be directly read off from eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) by making the replacement @xmath103 .",

    "both the solar neutrino oscillations ( @xmath106 ) and the reactor antineutrino oscillations ( @xmath107 ) are of the disappearance type . in comparison , the atmospheric muon - neutrino ( or muon - antineutrino ) oscillations are essentially of the disappearance type , and the accelerator neutrino ( or antineutrino ) oscillations can be of either type",

    "( 2.5 ) , the reactions @xmath108 and @xmath109 can take place via the charged - current interactions .",

    "( 2.11)(2.13 ) have to be replaced by their counterparts in matter @xcite .",
    "the fact that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed has been firmly established in the past two decades , thanks to a number of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino ( or antineutrino ) oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "let us briefly go over some of them in the following , before we discuss what is behind the observed pattern of lepton flavor mixing .    _",
    "a. solar neutrino oscillations _    the solar @xmath112 neutrinos were first observed in the homestake experiment in 1968 , but the measured flux was only about one third of the value predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "this anomaly was later confirmed by other experiments , such as gallex / gno @xcite , sage @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite .",
    "the sno experiment was particularly crucial because it provided the first model - independent evidence for the flavor conversion of solar @xmath9 neutrinos into @xmath10 and @xmath11 neutrinos .",
    "the target material of the sno detector is heavy water , which allows the solar @xmath112 neutrinos to be observed via the charged - current ( cc ) reaction @xmath113 , the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction @xmath114 and the elastic - scattering process @xmath115 ( for @xmath116 ) @xcite .",
    "the neutrino fluxes extracted from these three channels can be expressed as @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where @xmath120 denotes a sum of the fluxes of @xmath10 and @xmath11 neutrinos .",
    "if there were no flavor conversion , @xmath121 and @xmath122 would hold .",
    "the sno data yielded @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xcite , demonstrating the existence of flavor conversion ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) and supporting the ssm prediction for @xmath127 in a convincing way .",
    "in fact , the observed deficit of solar @xmath112 neutrinos is attributed to @xmath128 and @xmath28 transitions modified by significant matter effects in the core of the sun .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath112 neutrinos may roughly approximate to @xmath129 @xcite , leading us to @xmath130 .",
    "note that the recent borexino experiment has done a real - time measurement of the mono - energetic solar @xmath131 neutrinos and observed a remarkable deficit corresponding to @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this result can approximately be interpreted as a vacuum oscillation effect , since the low - energy @xmath131 neutrino oscillation is not very sensitive to matter effects in the sun @xcite .",
    "so one is left with the averaged survival probability @xmath133 for solar @xmath131 neutrinos , from which @xmath134 can be obtained .",
    "such a result is apparently consistent with the aforementioned value of @xmath50 extracted from the data of solar @xmath112 neutrinos .        _",
    "b. atmospheric neutrino oscillations",
    "_    it is well known that the atmospheric @xmath10 , @xmath23 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 events are produced in the earth s atmosphere by cosmic rays , mainly through the decay modes @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "if there were nothing wrong with the atmospheric neutrinos that enter and excite an underground detector , they would have an almost perfect spherical symmetry ( i.e. , the downward- and upward - going neutrino fluxes should be equal , @xmath139 and @xmath140 with respect to the zenith angle @xmath141 ) . in 1998",
    "the super - kamiokande collaboration observed an approximate up - down flux symmetry for atmospheric @xmath9 and @xmath5 events and a significant up - down flux asymmetry for atmospheric @xmath10 and @xmath23 events @xcite .",
    "such a striking anomaly could naturally be attributed to @xmath142 and @xmath143 oscillations for those upward - going @xmath10 and @xmath23 events , since the detector itself was insensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath25 events .",
    "this observation was actually the first _ model - independent _ discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations , and it marked an important turning point in experimental neutrino physics .    in 2004",
    "the super - kamiokande collaboration did a careful analysis of the disappearance probability of @xmath10 and @xmath23 events as a function of the neutrino flight length @xmath12 over the neutrino energy @xmath144 , and observed a clear dip in the @xmath145 distribution as the first _",
    "evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "such a dip is consistent with the sinusoidal probability of neutrino flavor oscillations but incompatible with exotic new physics , such as the neutrino decay and neutrino decoherence scenarios .",
    "it is a great challenge to directly observe the atmospheric @xmath142 oscillation because this requires the neutrino beam energy greater than a threshold of 3.5 gev , such that a tau lepton can be produced via the charged - current interaction of incident @xmath11 with the target nuclei in the detector .",
    "the super - kamiokande data are found to be best described by neutrino oscillations that include the @xmath11 appearance in addition to the overwhelming signature of the @xmath10 disappearance . in particular , a neural network analysis of the zenith - angle distribution of multi - gev contained events has recently demonstrated the @xmath11 appearance effect at the @xmath146 level @xcite .    _ c. accelerator neutrino oscillations _",
    "if the atmospheric @xmath10 and @xmath23 flavors oscillate , a fraction of the accelerator - produced @xmath10 and @xmath23 events may also disappear on their way to a remote detector .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by two long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments : k2k @xcite and minos @xcite . both of them observed a reduction of the @xmath10 flux and a distortion of the @xmath10 energy spectrum , implying @xmath147 oscillations .",
    "the most amazing result obtained from the atmospheric and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments is @xmath148 or equivalently @xmath149 , which hints at a likely @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry in the lepton sector .",
    "today the most important accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment is the t2k experiment , which has discovered the @xmath150 appearance oscillations and carred out a precision measurement of the @xmath147 disappearance oscillations .",
    "since its preliminary data were first released in 2011 , the t2k experiment has proved to be very successful in establishing the @xmath9 appearance out of a @xmath10 beam at the @xmath151 level and constraining the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath51 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the point is that the leading term of @xmath152 is sensitive to @xmath153 , and its sub - leading term is sensitive to @xmath49 and terrestrial matter effects @xcite .",
    "2.1 is an illustration of the allowed region of @xmath154 as a function of the cp - violating phase @xmath49 , as constrained by the present t2k data @xcite .",
    "one can observe an unsuppressed value of @xmath51 in this plot , together with a preliminary hint of @xmath49 around @xmath155 .",
    "the latter is also suggestive of a possible @xmath0-@xmath1 reflection symmetry , as one will see in section 3 .    in comparison with k2k , minos and t2k ,",
    "the accelerator - based opera experiment was designed to search for the @xmath11 appearance in a @xmath10 beam .",
    "after several years of data taking , the opera collaboration reported five @xmath11 events in 2015 .",
    "these events have marked a discovery of the @xmath156 appearance oscillations with the @xmath157 significance @xcite .    _",
    "d. reactor antineutrino oscillations _    since the first observation of the @xmath5 events emitted from the savannah river reactor in 1956 @xcite , nuclear reactors have been playing a special role in neutrino physics . in particular , @xmath50 and @xmath51 have been measured in the kamland @xcite and daya bay @xcite reactor antineutrino experiments , respectively .    given the average baseline length @xmath158 km , the kamland experiment was sensitive to the @xmath159-driven @xmath160 oscillations and could accomplish a terrestrial test of the large - mixing - angle msw solution to the long - standing solar neutrino problem .",
    "in fact , it succeeded in doing so in 2003 @xcite , with an impressive determination of @xmath130 .",
    "a very striking sinusoidal behavior of @xmath161 against @xmath145 was also observed by the kamland collaboration later on @xcite .",
    "the daya bay experiment was designed to probe the smallest lepton flavor mixing angle @xmath51 with an unprecedented sensitivity @xmath162 by measuring the @xmath163-driven @xmath107 oscillation with a baseline length @xmath164 km . in 2012",

    "historically , the discussion about this simple flavor symmetry was motivated by the experimental facts @xmath255 and @xmath256 @xcite , which point to @xmath213 and @xmath257 as an ideal possibility . in this case",
    "the pmns matrix @xmath45 is greatly simplified and may take the following form in a chosen phase convention : @xmath258 where @xmath259 will manifest itself in the corresponding neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 .",

    "are all taken to be real @xcite . both @xmath268 lead to @xmath274 , as the phases or signs of the elements of @xmath45 can always be rearranged to assure its mixing angles to lie in the first quadrant .",
    "this kind of rephasing is implemented by redefining the phases of relevant lepton fields . in the following we shall focus on the @xmath275 case . note that the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry has no definite prediction for @xmath50 .",

    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) will become more predictive if its free parameters are further constrained .",
    "let us consider two simple but instructive cases for illustration :    * if @xmath280 is assumed , then eq . ( 3.8 ) leads us to the prediction @xmath281 or equivalently @xmath282 .",

    "if @xmath287 is taken , then eq . ( 3.8 ) yields @xmath288 . in this case one arrives at another special pattern of the neutrino mixing matrix  the so - called bi - maximal ( bm ) flavor mixing pattern @xcite : @xmath289 as well as the mass eigenvalues @xmath290 , @xmath291 and @xmath286 .",
    "considering other constraints on the free parameters of @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) , one may similarly derive other neutrino mixing patterns which maintain @xmath274 and @xmath292 but predict different values of @xmath50 ( e.g. , the golden - ratio @xcite and hexagonal @xcite patterns ) .",
    "in such examples all the three flavor mixing angles are constants , which have nothing to do with the neutrino masses .",
    "it is possible to link @xmath50 with the ratio of @xmath293 to @xmath294 in the following way @xcite : @xmath295 if @xmath296 ( i.e. , @xmath297 ) holds . on the other hand , taking @xmath298 will lead to @xmath299 , as one can see from eq .",
    "such a special neutrino mass spectrum is not in conflict with the present experimental data , and it may have some interesting consequences in neutrino phenomenology @xcite .    at this point",
    "let us point out that the canonical @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry can be generalized in a way described by the transformation matrix @xcite @xmath300 obviously , this symmetry will be reduced to the canonical one if @xmath301 and @xmath302 are taken .",
    "the requirement of @xmath58 being invariant under @xmath303 imposes the following constraints on its elements : @xmath304 such an @xmath58 will result in a flavor mixing matrix @xmath45 consisting of @xmath292 and @xmath305 .",

    "but in what follows we shall focus on the canonical @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry , simply because it is much simpler and favored by the experimental result @xmath312 .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that there is a remarkable variant of the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry  the so - called @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation _ antisymmetry _ @xcite .",
    "when the latter is concerned , the neutrino mass matrix satisfies the transformation @xmath313 and thus it has a special form @xmath314 the unitary matrix used to diagonalize this special mass matrix is given by @xmath315 where @xmath316 . in this case @xmath50 and @xmath48 are both equal to @xmath215 , and a finite value of @xmath51 is allowed .",
    "the three mass eigenvalues of @xmath317 are @xmath318 , @xmath319 and 0 , respectively . to fit current neutrino oscillation data",

    "this point will become clearer in section 3.3 .    to summarize ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry was motivated by the early experimental data of neutrino oscillations and has played an important role in understanding the lepton flavor structures .",
    "the discovery of a relatively large value of @xmath51 @xcite requires one to go beyond the original model - building scope in this respect , either by taking into account much larger @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking effects @xcite or by paying particular attention to the @xmath0-@xmath1 _ reflection _ symmetry .",
    "the latter approach is more attractive because it can both produce a nonzero @xmath51 and predict @xmath321 in the first place ( i.e. , in the symmetry limit ) .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 reflection symmetry was originally put forward by harrison and scott @xcite , who were inspired by the approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 universality in the neutrino oscillation data .",

    "thanks to its unitarity , @xmath45 contains four independent real parameters which can be chosen as @xmath324 , @xmath325 , @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",

    "the elements of @xmath374 may not be at the same order of magnitude , and some of them are even possible to vanish at the tree level .",
    "provided the higher - order contributions break the flavor symmetry , then they may play a dominant role in those originally vanishing entries to make the predictions of the resulting neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 compatible with current neutrino oscillation data .",

    "a good example of this kind is a hierarchical neutrino mass matrix which can lead us to the mass spectrum @xmath479 . in this case",

    "it is possible to obtain an appreciable value of @xmath51 , but lifting the degeneracy of @xmath247 and @xmath294 requires a higher - order perturbation .",
    "last but not least , there is a well - known form of @xmath58 which yields an inverted neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath506 at the tree level : @xmath507 in which the most general next - to - leading - order terms have been included .",
    "this particular texture of @xmath58 can be attributed to an @xmath508 flavor symmetry @xcite  namely , the leading - order entries have a vanishing @xmath508 charge but the others do not . after a straightforward calculation ,",

    "now let us recapitulate some key issues concerning an application of the group - theoretical arguments to some model - building exercises .",
    "the most important issue in building a flavor - symmetry model is how to break @xmath848 while preserving the desired residual symmetries . to serve this purpose",
    ", one may introduce a new type of scalar fields  _ flavons _ , which do not carry any quantum number of the sm gauge symmetry but can constitute some nontrivial representations of @xmath848 .",
    "they break a given flavor symmetry via acquiring their appropriate vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . in the canonical ( type - i ) seesaw mechanism",
    "the lagrangian responsible for generating the lepton masses may take a general form as @xmath879 in which @xmath880 and @xmath871 stand respectively for the right - handed charged - lepton and neutrino fields , and the superscripts @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath881 denote the representations occupied by the fermion and flavon fields .",
    "since the flavor symmetry breaks in different manners in the charged - lepton and neutrino sectors , the flavon fields for these two sectors are distinct .",
    "but when @xmath882 and @xmath883 have the same transformation properties , they can be identified as the same field . in order to separate @xmath884 from @xmath885 , an extra symmetry is usually needed ( e.g. , an auxiliary @xmath886 symmetry under which @xmath884 and @xmath880 are odd while the other fields are even ) .",
    "furthermore , there must be enough independent flavon fields so that the yukawa coupling parameters present in each sector can fit the lepton masses .",
    "note that @xmath887 represents a high energy scale above which the new fields may become active , and the ratio of a flavon s vev to @xmath887 ( denoted as @xmath888 ) is typically assumed to be a small quantity such that the magnitude of a yukawa coupling parameter can be regulated by the power of @xmath485  the spirit of the froggatt - nielsen mechanism for explaining the observed quark mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this point will become relevant when one needs to either produce a hierarchical mass matrix like @xmath59 or discuss the soft breaking of a flavor symmetry by higher - order terms . in this connection it is necessary to know what forms",
    "the flavon vevs @xmath889 should take in order to break all the flavor symmetries apart from @xmath850 and @xmath890 .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath62 will be invariant under @xmath847 if @xmath891 satisfies the condition @xcite @xmath892 similarly , the effective neutrino mass matrix resulting from the seesaw mechanism will be unchanged with respect to @xmath822 provided @xcite @xmath893 if a flavon field has no way to offer the proper vev required by eq .",
    "( 4.10 ) or ( 4.11 ) , it has to be forbidden to acquire a vev and therefore contributes nothing to the lepton masses .",
    "with these observations in mind , we are well prepared to assign suitable representations for the fermion and flavon fields in order to build a phenomenologically viable model .    we proceed to illustrate the above points using a simple flavor model based on @xmath894 @xcite .",

    "\\(1 ) @xmath62 and @xmath58 can not simultaneously possess the same @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "otherwise , the resulting lepton flavor mixing pattern would only contain a finite value of @xmath50 and thus be unrealistic .",
    "that is why one usually takes @xmath59 to be diagonal and attributes the effects of lepton flavor mixing purely to @xmath58 in a specific model - building exercise . of course",
    ", one may impose a flavor symmetry on @xmath233 but keep @xmath234 diagonal , or allow both of them to be structurally non - diagonal and unparallel .",
    "different basis choices are equivalent in principle , but one basis is likely to be advantageous over another in practice when building an explicit model to determine or constrain the flavor structures of both charged leptons and neutrinos . to illustrate this phenomenological point",
    ", we assume @xmath1058 to have the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry in a form like that given in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) , leading to the eigenvalues @xmath1059 ( for @xmath208 ) whose expressions are analogous to those given in eq . ( 3.9 ) . in this case one has to tolerate some significant cancellations among the parameters of @xmath1058 in order to generate a strongly hierarchical charged - lepton mass spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath1060 as shown in fig .",
    "2.2 @xcite ) .",
    "it is certainly possible to conjecture that there exists a flavor symmetry which guarantees the exact cancellations and thus @xmath1061 at the lowest order , and it is the effect of flavor symmetry breaking that gives rise to nonzero @xmath1062 and @xmath596 together with the associated flavor mixing parameters . assuming the strength of symmetry breaking to be @xmath1063",
    ", one may expect that the finite values of @xmath596 , @xmath51 and @xmath1064 emerge at the @xmath1065 level while nonzero @xmath1062 arises at the @xmath1066 level .",
    "to achieve such results , however , a delicate arrangement of the relevant perturbation terms is indispensable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the neutrino mass spectrum should not exhibit a strong hierarchy unless @xmath293 is negligibly small .",
    "another point is also noteworthy : although the lepton flavor mixing matrix is a constant matrix in the symmetry limit , it may be strongly correlated with the mass spectrum of charged leptons or neutrinos ( or both of them ) after the flavor symmetry is broken .",
    "when discussing the effects of @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking , one therefore prefers to work in the basis of @xmath59 being diagonal such that it is more straightforward to infer some information about the neutrino mass spectrum from the experimental observations of @xmath51 and @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , let us simply concentrate on the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation or reflection symmetry of @xmath58 and its possible breaking schemes in the basis where @xmath59 itself is diagonal .",
    "\\(2 ) a @xmath1067 flavor symmetry or its subgroup should be invoked in the charged - lepton sector to make @xmath62 diagonal .",
    "nevertheless , the left - handed charged - lepton and neutrino fields reside in the same @xmath1068 doublets , so the symmetry placed on one sector should equally act on the other sector .",
    "hence the major challenge in model building is to preserve a symmetry in one sector but break it properly in the other sector . to serve this purpose , additional higgs ( or flavon ) fields furnishing nontrivial representations of the flavor symmetry",
    "are generally needed . in this connection",
    "the higgs ( or flavon ) fields , which are neutral with respect to the symmetry for keeping the diagonality of @xmath845 but transform nontrivially under the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry , can be employed to break the would - be degeneracy between @xmath1069 and @xmath1070 .",
    "\\(3 ) a number of flavor - symmetry models , which are phenomenologically viable , have typically used the canonical seesaw mechanism to explain the smallness of three neutrino masses .",
    "accordingly , at least two right - handed neutrinos are introduced in addition to the sm fields .",
    "no matter whether they assume the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry or not , the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 will have this symmetry provided the left - handed neutrinos respect the same symmetry .",
    "this interesting point can be explicitly seen from the seesaw formula @xmath1071 @xcite by taking the form of @xmath925 as @xmath1072 where @xmath927 is an arbitrary symmetric matrix .",
    "however , one might wish that the right - handed neutrinos should also obey some flavor symmetries in order to reduce the number of free parameters @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we aim to use a series of models , proposed by grimus and lavoura @xcite , to illustrate the essential ingredients for building a phenomenologically viable model based on the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "the main idea of their models is that the @xmath1067 symmetry is conserved by the yukawa interactions but softly broken by the dimension - three majorana mass terms of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "thus let us introduce three right - handed neutrinos @xmath1073 ( for @xmath1074 ) and allow each of them to carry an associated lepton number . to properly break the flavor symmetry , three higgs doublets @xmath1075 ( for @xmath84 )",
    "are needed and each of them develops a vev @xmath1076 ( for @xmath1077 gev ) .",
    "in addition to the lepton - number symmetries , two @xmath43-type flavor symmetries are also enforced @xcite : @xmath1078 here @xmath1079 is the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry interchanging all the fermion fields of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flavors .",
    "note that @xmath1080 is odd under the @xmath1079 symmetry , and thus it will break this symmetry when obtaining a vev .",
    "such a requirement is actually necessary for obtaining @xmath1081 , as one will see later on .",
    "in addition , there is an auxiliary symmetry @xmath1082 which separates @xmath1083 from @xmath1084 and @xmath1080 .",
    "because of this symmetry , @xmath1085 and @xmath1080 are responsible for the mass generation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 while @xmath1083 only couples to @xmath1086 as well as @xmath1073 .",
    "given the above setting , the lagrangian for generating lepton masses is expressed as @xcite @xmath1087 where @xmath1088 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath59 and @xmath925 turn out to be diagonal : @xmath1089 note that it is the coexistence of @xmath1085 and @xmath1080 that renders @xmath1090 .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath927 breaks the lepton - number symmetries in a soft way but maintains the other symmetries , so it also possesses the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry . taking account of the seesaw formula , one therefore arrives at the light majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 which shares the same symmetry .",
    "several comments on this simple but instructive model - building approach are in order .",
    "\\(a ) in such a model the right - handed neutrinos necessarily suffer the @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry .",
    "the reason is that @xmath1091 and @xmath1092 do not commute with @xmath1093 . as a result of the @xmath1094 ( or @xmath1095 ) symmetry , @xmath1096 ( or @xmath1097 )",
    "is only allowed to have couplings to @xmath1098 and @xmath1099 ( or @xmath1100 and @xmath1101 ) . in order to keep @xmath1102 invariant under @xmath1103 , @xmath1104 and @xmath1100 have to transform into each other as @xmath14 and @xmath15 do .",

    "furthermore , @xmath1094 , @xmath1105 and @xmath1106 may be unified in a larger non - abelian group which proves to be the two - dimensional orthogonal group @xmath1107 @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) another issue concerns the introduction of so many higgs doublets .",
    "although the rates of lepton - flavor - changing processes can be under control @xcite , one has to overcome some other phenomenological problems brought by so many electroweak - scale scalars ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the discussions on some consequences of the multi - higgs fields introduced in a number of flavor - symmetry models ) . to isolate the flavor symmetry issues from the electroweak issues",

    "and @xmath424 ( or @xmath425 ) has the same transformation properties as @xmath1085 ( or @xmath1080 ) with respect to @xmath1103 and @xmath886 .",
    "correspondingly , the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses can be obtained from that in eq .",
    "( 5.3 ) with the replacements @xmath1108",
    "\\(c ) from the point of view of naturalness , the strong mass hierarchy of charged leptons needs some explanations . as for the model under discussion ,",
    "the smallness of @xmath1109 can be easily explained with the help of the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite . if one assigns a @xmath1110 charge @xmath852 to @xmath1086 , then the yukawa interaction term for the electron will become @xmath1111 where @xmath952 is a flavon field carrying a @xmath1110 charge of @xmath26 .",
    "given @xmath1112 as a very small quantity , @xmath1109 is suppressed by @xmath1113 . however , this model does not permit the same mechanism to explain the smallness of @xmath1069 as compared with @xmath1070 .",
    "one finds that a relation @xmath1114 with an accuracy of about @xmath1115 is required for obtaining the realistic values of @xmath1069 and @xmath1070 .",
    "although a fine - tuning of this amount is not unacceptable , it is better to find a more natural way to obtain this kind of approximate relation .",

    "theoretically , exploring some appropriate physical contexts that can justify these two particular mixing patterns makes sense . besides the residual - symmetry approach discussed in section 4.1 @xcite ,",
    "the friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry @xcite can also lead to the tm1 and tm2 mixing patterns in a natural way .",
    "the fl symmetry in the neutrino sector is defined in the sense that the neutrino mass operators should be invariant under the following translational transformations for the neutrino fields : @xmath1202 in which @xmath55 runs over @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath1203 is a spacetime - independent grassmann - algebra element which anti - commutes with the neutrino fields , and @xmath1204 are the complex coefficients .",

    "a simple way out is to add a universal term @xmath1212 to the above neutrino mass operators @xcite , leading to @xmath1213 . but",
    "this term explicitly breaks the fl symmetry , and hence it needs a convincing explanation .",
    "another way out is to modify the fl symmetry by assuming @xmath1214 @xcite , and the associated neutrino mass matrix reads @xmath1215 similarly , @xmath412 can transform @xmath617 into the form @xmath1216 which can be further diagonalized by a complex @xmath796 rotation .",
    "hence the resultant neutrino mixing matrix will be the tm2 pattern .",
    "in particular , @xmath1217 comes out from this ansatz , implying that such a modified fl symmetry does not need to be broken .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a combination of the modified fl symmetry and the @xmath0-@xmath1 reflection symmetry can pin down all the physical parameters of massive neutrinos .",
    "note that @xmath1218 allows for this kind of operation which otherwise would not make sense . in this specific scenario",
    "the neutrino mass matrix maintains its form in eq .",

    "the modified fl symmetry can lead us to some definite predictions which are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data , but the fl symmetry itself remains puzzling and needs a further study .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the tm1 and tm2 mixing patterns can also be derived via the _ indirect model _ approach . to achieve the tm1 or tm2 mixing matrix based on an indirect model which has been introduced at the end of section 4.2 for realizing @xmath1185 , one has to modify the vev alignments in eq .",

    "one can go back to the mass basis of right - handed neutrinos by means of a complex @xmath796 or @xmath750 rotation which will in turn change the yukawa coupling matrix of the neutrinos .",
    "then it is easy to check that the seesaw formula allows us to arrive at a particular texture of @xmath58 , which finally leads us to the tm1 or tm2 neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "a  sterile \" neutrino @xmath1230 , as its name suggests , does not carry any quantum number of the sm gauge symmetry and thus does not directly take part in the standard weak interactions . although there has not been any convincing evidence for sterile neutrinos , their existence is either theoretically motivated or experimentally hinted .",
    "a good example of this kind is the _ heavy _ right - handed neutrinos introduced for implementing the type - i seesaw mechanism . on the other hand , the long - standing lsnd anomaly @xcite indicates the possible existence of an @xmath1231 sterile neutrino which can more or less mix with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "there are also a few other short - baseline neutrino - oscillation anomalies , such as the reactor @xcite , gallium @xcite and miniboone @xcite anomalies , which could be explained with the help of active - sterile neutrino mixing .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate an implementation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 flavor symmetry in the presence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "one interesting proposal in this respect is that the sterile neutrino sector may be responsible for the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking @xcite . in this subsection",

    "but it is unnecessary to assume @xmath1235 if the origin of sterile neutrinos is different from that of active ones .",
    "for instance , the active neutrino sector can be viewed as a consequence of the type - slowromancap2@ seesaw mechanism @xcite while the other elements of @xmath1234 might originate from the canonical seesaw mechanism .",
    "a general @xmath1236 neutrino mass matrix can be diagonalized by a @xmath1237 unitary matrix @xmath1238 to give 4 real mass eigenvalues @xmath83 ( for @xmath1239 ) .",
