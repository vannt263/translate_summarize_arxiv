    "quantum contextuality , which is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory , was independently discovered by bell @xcite , kochen and specker ( ks ) @xcite .",
    "contextuality is usually revealed by the non - contextual inequality , quantum - mechanical violation of which implies the nonexistence of the non - contextual hidden variable models .",
    "several important applications of contextuality have recently been found in the certification of random number @xcite as well as the speeding up of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "graph theory has had wide applications in information theory .",
    "very recently , cabello , severini and winter ( csw ) have introduced a general graph - theoretic approach for studying contextuality @xcite , this allows to show that quantum contextuality is closely related to the lovsz number @xcite , an important parameter used in optimization and information theory . for a given noncontextuality inequality @xmath2 with some exclusivity relation ,",
    "it can always be represented by an exclusivity graph .",
    "the concrete way is as follows .",
    "there is an exclusivity relation between two rank-@xmath3 projective measurements @xmath4 and @xmath5 if they are orthogonal to each other .",
    "there is an edge @xmath6 between two vertices @xmath7 if and only if @xmath8 are exclusive .",
    "the set of all the exclusivity relations of all @xmath4 s is said to be the exclusivity relation of the noncontextual inequality .",
    "in addition , one can associate each @xmath4 with a weight @xmath9 to the @xmath10-th vertex . in this way",
    ", the constructed graph @xmath11 is called as the exclusivity graph of the noncontextual inequality , where @xmath12 is the set of vertices , @xmath13 is the set of edges and @xmath14 is the set of weights . and",
    "as shown in @xcite , the classical bound of @xmath15 is just the independence number @xmath16 of the graph @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to study the maximal quantum violation @xmath18 for the inequality ( [ inequ1 ] ) as well as the optimal representation for projectors @xmath4 s .",
    "remarkably ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that @xmath18 is nothing but the lovsz number @xmath19 of the graph @xmath17 @xcite . correspondingly , the optimal representation for the projectors is often called as the lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation ( loor ) .",
    "let us take the klyachko - can - biniciolu - shumovsky ( kcbs ) inequality @xcite as an example .",
    "the kcbs inequality is the simplest noncontextual inequality for the three - dimensional system , in the sense that it requires the minimal number of projective measurements .",
    "the kcbs inequality is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 is quantum state , and @xmath5 s are rank-1 projective measurements with exclusivity relations : @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "the exclusivity graph for the kcbs inequality is a pentagon graph , in which the weights of all vertices are equal to 1 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it has been known that the maximal quantum violation is @xmath26 , and the corresponding lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation can be realized in the three - dimensional real hilbert space as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and  @xmath29 \" means transpose of a matrix .    for a general exclusivity graph of noncontextual inequality , the original lovsz number is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 run over all possible _ real _ unit vectors such that @xmath33 if vertices @xmath7 are connected .",
    "note that in quantum theory ( qt ) @xmath18 can be always obtained for a pure state @xmath31 since the noncontextual inequality is linear , and each @xmath5 can be written as a form of @xmath34",
    ". then the definition of lovsz number directly implies that the upper bound of @xmath15 in quantum case is just @xmath35 if @xmath18 is always obtained for a set of projectors @xmath5 in a real hilbert space of suitable dimension .    quantum theory and quantum information theory",
    "are based on the hilbert space .",
    "it has been claimed that  _ ... taken into account that the maximum value of @xmath15 in qt is always obtained for a quantum pure state @xmath31 and a set of projectors @xmath36 in a real hilbert space of suitable dimension _ \" @xcite , namely , the lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation can be always realized in the real hilbert space . to our knowledge ,",
    "a detailed proof for the claim has not been given in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this paper to provide such a proof .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study the exclusivity graph originated from the work of bengtssona , blanchfielda , and cabello ( bbc ) , the bbc-21-ray @xcite , in which the vectors @xmath37 s have been given by the complex unit vectors .",
    "this in turn provides the first example for a nontrivial realization of the loor in the _ complex _ hilbert space , and also arises immediately a natural question : for bbc-21-ray , can one realize its loor in the real hilbert space of suitable dimension ( as the claim mentioned above ) ?",
    "the answer is positive . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath35 , which are the lovsz numbers in terms of complex and real unit vectors , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv and sec .",
    "v , we give two procedures to construct a real loor from a complex one .",
    "the first procedure is in the operator perspective while the second one is in the vector perspective .",
    "conclusion is made in the last section .",
    "the noncontextual inequality of bbc-21-ray is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath5 s satisfy the exclusivity relation as shown in its exclusivity graph ( see fig.[bbc21rayfig ] ) .",
    "the 21 complex unit vectors @xmath37 s are as follows : @xmath40        originally , bbc-21-ray was proposed to develop a state - independent noncontextuality ( sic ) inequality for a qutrit ( a three - dimensional quantum system ) .",
    "this inequality holds for any noncontextual theory , while the upper bound of @xmath15 is @xmath41 holds for any state of a qutrit .",
    "in addition , the lovsz number of the graph can be computed as @xmath42 by using the semidefinite programming , thus @xmath43 .",
    "let us generalize a little bit the lovsz number in terms of complex unit vectors as :    @xmath44    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 run over all possible _ complex _ unit vectors such that @xmath33 if vertices @xmath45 are connected . by choosing @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the complex vectors @xmath37 s in eq .",
    "( [ vbbc ] ) , one immediately has @xmath48 and automatically obtains a complex realization of loor in the hilbert space .    here",
    ", we would like to address that , the bbc-21-ray graph indeed can have a real realization of loor in the hilbert space by performing the procedures in sec .",
    "iii or sec .",
    "the real loor can be realized in @xmath49 dimension .",
    "the result is @xmath50 and @xmath37 s are as follows    @xmath51    then @xmath52 this yields directly @xmath53 .    _",
    "remark 1._ the 21 complex unit vectors @xmath37 s in eq .",
    "( [ vbbc ] ) can not be rotated to 21 real unit vectors simultaneously by a general unitary transformation .",
    "this implies that the realization of the complex vectors together with the complex loor are nontrivial .    _",
    "remark 2._ the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) is still @xmath54 implies the set of @xmath31 and @xmath37 s is indeed a loor in the real hilbert space .",
    "however , the other eigenvalues are less than @xmath54 implies that the inequality ( [ bbcsic ] ) is no longer an sic inequality in @xmath55-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "thus , the complex hilbert space is still needed if we want to keep some special properties of the inequality , like state - independent noncontextuality @xcite .",
    "for convenience , let s firstly list some symbol assumptions :    1 .   @xmath56 is the real part and the imaginary part of @xmath57 respectively for @xmath58 is a number , a vector or a matrix .",
    "2 .   @xmath59 means @xmath60 where @xmath61 are two matrices .",
    "@xmath62 means that @xmath63 is a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "@xmath64 is the set of real @xmath65 dimensional matrices .",
    "@xmath66 is the set of complex @xmath65 dimensional matrices .    to prove that upper bound of @xmath15 in quantum case is the lovsz number is equivalent to prove @xmath67 it s obvious that @xmath68 , we also need to show that @xmath69 for any graph @xmath17 .",
    "it has been prove that @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a matrix full of @xmath3 while @xmath72 is the matrix whose @xmath10-rule @xmath73-column element is @xmath3 and the rest are @xmath74 .",
    "it can be proven that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 the proof is as follows . if the set of complex unit vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 s is an optimal solution , that is , @xmath79 .",
    "then it s directly to see that the set of complex unit vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 s is also optimal .",
    "without loss of generality , we can always assume that @xmath82 .",
    "denote @xmath83 as the matrix such that @xmath84 .",
    "one can check that @xmath83 satisfies the conditions in eq .",
    ", and @xmath85 .",
    "define @xmath86 since @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 implies @xmath90 and @xmath91 is necessary for @xmath92 , so @xmath93 . on the other hand , it s directly to see that @xmath94 because @xmath95 is necessary for @xmath96 .",
    "after all , @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath97 , which implies the quantum upper bound of the noncontextual inequality equals to the original lovsz number .    _",
    "remark 3._ for the general noncontextual inequality ( [ inequ1 ] ) , whose weights maybe not are all @xmath3 s , then its exclusivity graph is the weighted graph . we can change the maximized object @xmath98 to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 . and the rest of the proof is same . on the other hand , we can give two procedures to construct a real optimal solution ( the loor realized in the real hilbert space ) from a complex one , which shows @xmath97 from another point of views .",
    "one procedure is in the operator perspective while the other one is in the vector perspective .",
    "assume the set of pure state @xmath101 and rank-@xmath3 projectors @xmath102 s is an optimal complex solution for the inequality @xmath103 , that is , @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "then the first step to construct a real optimal solution is constructing real projector @xmath105 s such that @xmath106 it s easy to find that @xmath105 s are rank-@xmath107 projectors and @xmath108 if @xmath109 .",
    "what s more , we claim that the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath110 is the same as @xmath111 , that is , the lovsz number .",
    "let s denote    @xmath112    then @xmath113 the claim is implied by the following lemma .",
    "@xmath61 are two @xmath65 dimensional real matrice",
    ". then @xmath114 if and only if @xmath115 .    denote @xmath116 , then @xmath117 is a positive definite hermite matrix .",
    "so , @xmath118    till now , we have constructed the real rank-@xmath107 projectors from the complex ones .",
    "we continue to construct the real rank-@xmath3 projectors based on the rank-@xmath107 ones in the next step .",
    "let s denote @xmath119 directly calculation shows that @xmath120 which means the rank-@xmath107 mixed state @xmath121 is optimal .",
    "if we choose a rank-@xmath3 decomposition of @xmath122 , then @xmath123 are all optimal .",
    "and we can always decompose @xmath105 into rank-@xmath3 projectors @xmath124 such that @xmath125 . then @xmath126 and @xmath127 if @xmath108 .",
    "it s easy to find that @xmath128 is such a construction .",
    "after all , the set of @xmath129 and @xmath130 s is the real rank-@xmath3 optimal solution for the quantum case .",
    "we go on to give the vector construction procedure , which is essentially equivalent to the projector one .",
    "assume the set of @xmath0 dimensional unit vectors @xmath31 and @xmath78 s is an optimal compelx solution , that is , @xmath131 .",
    "then the construction procedure is as following .",
    "the first step is to find a basis @xmath132 such that @xmath133 .",
    "the second step is to construct @xmath134 as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is such an angle that @xmath137 . since @xmath138",
    ", @xmath139 will always be @xmath74 .",
    "the third step is mapping any @xmath140 to the @xmath141-dimensional vector @xmath142 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    denote @xmath143 , @xmath144 for @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , then we can check that @xmath147 and the exclusivity relations @xmath148 denote @xmath149 , then @xmath150 and @xmath151 which means @xmath152 s and @xmath31 are in a @xmath1-dimensional subspace .",
    "thus , we can reduce the @xmath141-dimensional unit vectors @xmath153 and @xmath152 s to @xmath1-dimensional ones without changing the exclusivity relations and @xmath154 .",
    "till now , we have completed the vector procedure and the real unit vectors for the bbc-21-ray as shown in eq .",
    "( [ 21real ] ) have been successfully constructed by these two procedures .",
    "in conclusion , we have proved in detail that the lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation for any exclusivity graph can be realized in the real hilbert space of suitable dimension .",
    "explicitly , if there is a lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation realized in the @xmath0-dimensional complex hilbert space , then there always exists a corresponding lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation in the @xmath1-dimensional real hilbert space .",
    "very recently , a general set of sic has been developed for a single qutrit @xcite , in which there are @xmath155 complex rays that involve the bbc-21-ray as a special case .",
    "the real as well as the complex lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation could be obtained accordingly , which we shall investigate subsequently .",
