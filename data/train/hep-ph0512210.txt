    "partons ( quarks and gluons ) , are the concepts that are central to discussions of the qcd aspects of high - energy collisions such as those at the fermilab tevatron and the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "quarks and gluons , however , are not observable , and in their place one sees _ jets , _ collimated bunches of high - energy hadrons which are the result of the fragmentation and hadronisation of the original hard ( high - energy ) partons .",
    "today s limited understanding of non - perturbative qcd is such that it is not currently possible to predict the exact patterns of hadrons produced .",
    "instead one makes predictions in terms of quarks and gluons and relates these to observations in terms of hadron jets .",
    "naively , jets are easily identified  one simply searches for bunches of collimated hadrons .",
    "however , to carry out accurate comparisons between parton - level predictions and hadron - level observations one needs a well - defined ` jet - finding ' procedure .",
    "the jet - finder is applied both to perturbatively predicted partonic configurations and to observed hadronic configurations and one then directly compares distributions for the predicted partonic jets and the observed hadronic jets .",
    "though partonic and hadronic jets are not equivalent , there is strong evidence ( theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite ) that the comparison can be performed with controlled accuracy .",
    "insofar as jet - finding is an approximate attempt to invert the quantum mechanical processes of qcd branching and hadronisation , it is not a unique procedure .",
    "various kinds of jet - finders have been proposed , among them cone - type @xcite and sequential - clustering @xcite jet - finders ( for alternatives , see @xcite ) .",
    "cone jet - finders are the most frequently used at the tevatron .",
    "they are based on identifying energy - flow into cones in ( pseudo)rapidity @xmath4 and azimuth @xmath5 , together with various steps of iteration , merging and splitting of the cones to obtain the final jets .",
    "cone jet - finders tend to be rather complex , different experiments have used different variants ( some of them infrared unsafe ) , and it is often difficult to know exactly which jet - finder to use in theoretical comparisons .",
    "in contrast , the cluster - type jet - finders , generally based on successive pair - wise recombination of particles , have simple definitions and are all infrared safe ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall focus here on the most widely used of them , the @xmath0 jet - finder  @xcite , defined below . among its physics advantages are ( a ) that it purposely mimics a walk backwards through the qcd branching sequence , which means that reconstructed jets naturally collect most of the particles radiated from an original hard parton , giving better particle mass measurements @xcite , general kinematic reconstruction  @xcite and gaps - between - jets identification @xcite ( of relevance to higgs searches ) ; and ( b ) it allows one to decompose a jet into constituent subjets , which is useful for identifying decay products of fast - moving heavy particles ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and various qcd studies .",
    "this has led to the widespread adoption of the @xmath0 jet - finder in the lep ( @xmath6 collisions ) and hera ( @xmath7 ) communities .    despite its advantages ,",
    "@xmath0 clustering has so far seen only limited study @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "the reasons for this are not entirely clear .",
    "one known drawback of the @xmath0 jet finder for high - multiplicity hadron - collider environments is its apparent algorithmic slowness : to cluster @xmath1 particles into jets requires @xmath8 operations in current implementations @xcite . for a typical event at the upcoming lhc , with an expected multiplicity of @xmath9 , this translates into a clustering time of @xmath10 of cpu time on a modern @xmath11 processor ; this is considerable given that the clustering has to be repeated for millions of events .",
    "for a typical heavy - ion event at lhc , where @xmath12 , the clustering time would grow to an unsustainable @xmath13 , i.e. more than one day ! even at the tevatron , where the multiplicity is quite modest , the fact that noise may cause the number of active calorimeter cells to be far larger than the number of particles has led to the use of a complex ( and physically questionable ) preclustering procedure prior to running the @xmath0 jet finder , so as to reduce the effective value of @xmath1 to something that is manageable  @xcite .",
    "the slowness of the @xmath0 jet - finder has been one of the motivating factors behind proposals for alternative jet - finders @xcite .",
    "here we will show that the @xmath0 jet - finder can in fact be formulated in an algorithmically fast ( @xmath3 ) manner",
    ". a c++ implementation of this ( and a related @xmath14 ) algorithm will be shown to run orders of magnitude faster than currently available implementations , making it feasible ( and easy ) to use the @xmath0 jet finder for efficiently studying high - multiplicity events .",
    "the @xmath0 jet finder , in the longitudinally invariant formulation suitable for hadron colliders , is defined as follows .",
    "* for each pair of particles @xmath15 , @xmath16 work out the @xmath0 distance @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the transverse momentum , rapidity and azimuth of particle @xmath15 ; for each parton @xmath15 also work out the beam distance @xmath22 .",
    "* find the minimum @xmath23 of all the @xmath24 . if @xmath23 is a @xmath25 merge particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 into a single particle , summing their four - momenta ( alternative recombination schemes are possible ) ;",
    "if it is a @xmath26 then declare particle @xmath15 to be a final jet and remove it from the list . *",
    "repeat from step 1 until no particles are left .",
    "there exist extensions of this basic procedure , ( a ) where @xmath25 is rescaled relative to @xmath26 by a user - chosen factor @xmath27 or ( b ) where clustering is stopped when all @xmath24 are above a jet resolution threshold @xmath28 .",
    "we here consider only the simplest version , as given above , but the arguments below are identical for the general case .",
    "now we reconsider the above procedure , making explicit the computational overheads of the various steps as implemented in standard jet finding codes @xcite",
    ".    1 .   given the initial set of particles , construct a table of all the @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "+ [ _ @xmath29 operations , done once _ ] 2 .",
    "scan the table to find the minimal value @xmath23 of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "merge or remove the particles corresponding to @xmath23 as appropriate .",
    "+ [ _ @xmath30 operations , done @xmath1 times _ ] 4 .",
    "update the table of @xmath25 , @xmath26 to take into account the merging or removal , and if any particles are left go to step 2",
    ". +    step 2 dominates , requiring @xmath31 operations .",
    "bytes ( double precision ) , which is manageable for @xmath32 but becomes an issue in heavy - ion environments with up to @xmath33 particles . at the ( substantial ) expense of recalculating the @xmath29 @xmath25 at each iteration , the storage issue can be eliminated . ]",
    "to obtain a better algorithm we isolate the geometrical aspects of the problem , with the help of the following observation .",
    "* lemma : * if @xmath15 , @xmath16 form the smallest @xmath25 , and @xmath34 , then @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , i.e.  @xmath16 is the geometrical nearest neighbour of particle @xmath15 .    *",
    "proof : * suppose the lemma is wrong and that there exists a particle @xmath37 such that @xmath38 : then @xmath39 and since @xmath40 , we have that @xmath41 , in contradiction with the statement that @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the smallest @xmath25 .",
    "this means that if we can identify each particle s geometrical nearest neighbour ( in terms of the geometrical @xmath42 distance ) , then we need not construct a size-@xmath14 table of @xmath17 , but only the size-@xmath1 array , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is @xmath15 s @xmath45eometrical nearest neighbour . we can therefore write the following algorithm :    1 .   for each particle @xmath15 establish its nearest neighbour @xmath44 and construct the arrays of the @xmath43 and @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   find the minimal value @xmath23 of the @xmath43 , @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   merge or remove the particles corresponding to @xmath23 as appropriate .",
    "4 .   identify which particles nearest neighbours have changed and update the arrays of @xmath43 and @xmath26 . if any particles are left go to step 2 .",
    "this already reduces the problem to one of complexity @xmath14 : for each particle we can find its nearest neighbour by scanning through all @xmath46 other particles [ @xmath29 operations ] ; calculating the @xmath43 , @xmath26 requires @xmath46 operations ; scanning through the @xmath43 , @xmath26 to find the minimal value @xmath23 takes @xmath46 operations [ to be repeated @xmath1 times ] ; and after a merging or removal , updating the nearest neighbour information will require @xmath46 operations [ to be repeated @xmath1 times ] . is removed or merged we have to update the nearest neighbour information for all particles that previously had @xmath15 as their nearest neighbour  fortunately one can show that on average , the number of particles that had @xmath15 as a nearest neighbour is of @xmath30 .",
    "one also needs to establish if any particles acquire the newly created particle @xmath37 as their nearest neighbour  this can be done in @xmath46 time by comparing each particle s current nearest neighbour distance with its distance to @xmath37 . ]",
    "we note , though , that three steps of this algorithm  initial nearest neighbour identification , finding @xmath23 at each iteration , and updating the nearest neighbour information at each iteration  bear close resemblance to problems studied in the computer science literature and for which efficient solutions are known :    * given an ensemble of vertices in a plane ( specified by the @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the particles ) , to find the nearest neighbour of each vertex one can use a structure known as a voronoi diagram @xcite or its dual , a delaunay triangulation .",
    "the voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells ( one per vertex ) , such that every point in the cell surrounding a vertex @xmath15 has @xmath15 as its nearest vertex .",
    "the structure is useful for nearest - neighbour location because the vertex @xmath44 nearest to vertex to @xmath15 is always in one of the ( few , i.e.  @xmath30 ) cells that share an edge with the cell of vertex @xmath15 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : voronoi ] .",
    "voronoi diagrams for @xmath1 points can be constructed with @xmath47 operations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and the nearest neighbour identification for all @xmath1 points can then be performed with a further @xmath46 operations . *",
    "dynamic insertion and removal of a point in the voronoi diagram , and corresponding updating of all nearest neighbour information , can be performed with @xmath48 operations @xcite ( to be repeated @xmath1 times ) . *",
    "the array of @xmath43 changes only by @xmath30 entries per iteration",
    ". therefore one can represent it with a binary tree structure , whose construction requires @xmath49 operations and in which finding the minimal value , insertion and removal are all guaranteed to require at most @xmath48 .",
    "the binary tree is constructed once at start - up , and there are then @xmath46 updates and searches for the minimum , leading to a total of @xmath50 operations .",
    "therefore both the geometrical and minimum - finding aspects of the @xmath0 jet - finder can be related to known problems whose solutions require @xmath49 operations .",
    "the voronoi diagram for ten random points .",
    "the delaunay triangulation ( red ) connecting the ten points is also shown .",
    "in this example the points 1 , 4 , 2 , 8 and 3 are the ` voronoi ' neighbours of 7 , and 3 is its nearest neighbour . ]",
    "the program fastjet codes concrete implementations of the @xmath14 and @xmath3 algorithms described above . it has been written in c++ and for the @xmath3 case makes use of a number of pre - existing components .",
    "construction of a voronoi diagram is a sufficiently common task ( useful in areas of science ranging from astronomy to zoology ) that several codes are publicly available . of these ,",
    "the only one that we found that also straightforwardly allows the addition and removal of points from a pre - constructed voronoi diagram , was the computational geometry algorithms library ( cgal ) @xcite , in particular its triangulation components @xcite.-@xmath5 space ) whereas cgal works on the euclidean plane .",
    "this problem can solved by making mirror copies of a small ( @xmath51 ) fraction of the vertices near the @xmath52 border . ] for the binary tree we made use of a ( red - black ) balanced tree .",
    "the running times ( on a 3 ghz pentium 4 processor with @xmath53  gb of memory , 512  kb of cache , and version 3.4 of the gnu g++ compiler ) of the ktjet  @xcite and fastjet implementations of the @xmath0-clustering jet - finder versus the number of initial particles .",
    "different values of @xmath1 have been obtained by taking a lhc dijet event with @xmath54  gev and adding on variable numbers of minimum bias events .",
    "both kinds of events have been simulated with pythia  6.3 @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : timings ] shows the running times for the two algorithms in fastjet as well as for ` ktjet ` , a standard implementation @xcite of the @xmath2 algorithm .",
    "our `` @xmath14 algorithm '' actually departs slightly from exact @xmath14 behaviour owing to certain further optimisations carried out .",
    "can be reduced by tiling the plane into rectangles of edge length @xmath55 .",
    "then for each vertex @xmath15 one can limit the nearest neighbour search to its own tile and adjacent tiles  vertices further away will have @xmath56 and so @xmath57 . ]",
    "the scaling with @xmath1 of the voronoi - based algorithm has been verified to go as @xmath3 , as expected .",
    "it is the fastest algorithm only for @xmath58 , owing to a large coefficient in front of its @xmath3 behaviour , mostly associated with the computational geometry tasks .",
    "this situation could conceivably be improved in the future by optimisations of the cgal package or by replacing it with a dedicated implementation of the construction and updating of the voronoi diagram .",
    "the better of the @xmath14 and @xmath59 algorithms ( which can be selected based on the value of @xmath1 ) runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the @xmath2 algorithm for all values of @xmath1 shown , vastly more at large @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparisons ] compares the running time of our combined @xmath14-@xmath59 ` fastjet ` implementation of the @xmath0 jet - finder with other jet - finders whose code is publicly available .",
    "one sees that it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than all others ( except the almost ir unsafe jetclu ) .",
    "the running times of various jet - finders versus the number of initial particles .",
    "jetclu is a widely - used cone - type jet - finder , however it is ` almost infrared unsafe ' , i.e.  perturbative predictions have large logarithmic dependence on small parameters ( e.g.  seed threshold ) @xcite .",
    "midpoint @xcite is an infrared safe cone - type jet finder . for",
    "both we use code and parameters from cdf  @xcite .",
    "the optimal jet finder  @xcite ( ojf ) has been run with @xmath60 and a maximum of 8 jets , so as to produce a final state similar to that returned by the @xmath0 and cone jet - finders and to limit its run time . ]",
    "since the fastjet algorithm is functionally equivalent to the standard @xmath2 algorithms used for the @xmath0 jet finder till now , the results of the clustering are of course identical to those of other implementations .",
    "howewer , its enhanced speed opens up new ways of using @xmath0 clustering in the analysis of high - multiplicity events .",
    "historically , one apparent drawback of @xmath0-type jets with respect to cone - type jets in hadron - hadron collisions was considered to be the larger fluctuations of the areas of the jets defined by the clustering procedure .",
    "such fluctuations would seem to make it more difficult to subtract , from the hard event , the energy coming from the non - perturbative underlying event and from any additional minimum bias interactions taking place in the same bunch crossing ( pileup ) .",
    "however , the fluctuations become irrelevant if one can easily estimate the area of _ each individual _ jet .",
    "this can be done on an event - by - event basis , as follows : because of the infrared safety of the @xmath0 jet - finder algorithm , one can add a large number of extremely soft particles ( `` ghosts '' ) to the event without modifying the properties of the hard jets . after clustering",
    ", each jet will contain a subset of the ghosts , and if the ghosts had a uniform density in @xmath61 and @xmath5 , then the number of ghosts in a given jet will be a measure of its area . in practice",
    "we have found that the use of @xmath62 ghost particles is necessary to obtain reliable area estimations .",
    "this definition for the area of a @xmath0 jet can of course be implemented with any coding of the jet - finder .",
    "it is however impractical , indeed nearly impossible , to deal with the required large number of ghost particles without a fast code .",
    "preliminary studies have shown that with simple assumptions about the uniformity of the underlying event and pileup , one can readily determine its size and subtract it from the hard jets , leading to good determinations of kinematical quantities ( e.g. invariant masses ) in high - luminosity @xmath63 collisions , or of single inclusive jet distributions in pb - pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "full results will be shown in  @xcite .",
    "two more observations are worth making before closing this section .",
    "they will both be discussed in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "the first is that it can also be interesting to examine alternative definitions of jet areas .",
    "one option is to make use of the areas of the voronoi cells of all the real particles belonging to a given jet .",
    "this definition avoids the need to cluster thousands of ghost particles together with the real ones .",
    "it instead rests on the geometrical properties of the event , and on the computational geometry component of the fastjet implementation .",
    "the second observation is that there exist clustering - type jet - finders other than the @xmath0 jet - finder that share a large fraction of its features ( including , of course , infrared safety ) , and the possibility of a fast implementation .",
    "one such example is the `` cambridge '' jet - finder .",
    "it was originally formulated in the context of @xmath6 collisions in  @xcite and an inclusive version , adapted to hadron collisions , was given in  @xcite .",
    "we shall call this inclusive version the cambridge / aachen algorithm .",
    "it is defined in the same way as the @xmath0 jet - finder at the beginning of section  [ sec : kt ] , but replacing the particle - particle distance by @xmath64 , and the particle - beam distance by @xmath65 .",
    "we shall show in  @xcite that the cambridge / aachen jet - finder has smaller average areas than the @xmath0 jet - finder , making it perhaps even better suited for jet studies in high - multiplicity environments .",
    "to conclude , we have identified an unexpected relation between clustering type jet - finders and a widely studied problem in computational geometry .",
    "the resulting reduction of the complexity of the @xmath0 jet - finding problem , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , opens up the previously inconceivable option of using the @xmath0 jet - finder for the large values of @xmath1 that arise when considering all cells of a finely segmented calorimeter and for heavy - ion events . for moderate @xmath1 , the one or two orders of magnitude in speed that we gain with a related @xmath14 approach pave the way to much wider use of the @xmath0 jet finder for normal hadron - collider jet studies , especially at the lhc .",
    "more generally , the speed gains discussed in this paper also suggest novel ways of using the @xmath0 jet finder , which are the subject of ongoing investigation .",
    "one example , given in section  [ sec : perspectives ] , is the determination of jet areas , knowledge of which is crucial for optimal subtraction of pileup contamination in high luminosity environments .",
