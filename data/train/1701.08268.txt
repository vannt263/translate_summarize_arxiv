    "the nuclear force , or the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential , is of crucial importance in nuclear physics .",

    "it is also used to study the equation of states of the nuclear matter , which provides important information about supernova explosions and neutron star structure . today",
    ", several types of phenomenological nuclear forces have been provided , which precisely describe a large number of experimental data of nn scattering and deuteron properties @xcite .",
    "chiral effective field theory has also made significant progress in determining the nuclear force @xcite .",
    "theoretical derivation of the nuclear force has long been a challenge .",
    "the problem is that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the ultimate theory of the strong interaction , shows a number of non - perturbative aspects at low energies .",
    "lattice qcd monte carlo calculation provides a promising framework to study the non - perturbative phenomena of qcd , such as hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the standard methods to study the scattering phenomena is lscher s finite volume method @xcite , which has been extensively applied to the nn system .",
    "recently , a method has been proposed by hal qcd collaboration @xcite to determine the nuclear force based on lattice qcd .",
    "it has been applied to many targets , including nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) , yy , and nnn interactions  @xcite . in the hal qcd method ,",
    "the nambu - bethe - salpeter ( nbs ) wave functions play a central role .",
    "the nuclear force is defined as an energy - independent _ `` wave function equivalent potential '' _ by demanding that the schrdinger equation should reproduce the nbs wave functions for many different energy levels .",
    "the asymptotic long - distance behavior of the nbs wave functions ensures that the potential thus obtained reproduces the scattering phase shift correctly @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the phase shifts from the hal qcd method agree quite well with those from lscher s finite volume method in the @xmath0 system .",
    "although different choice of interpolating fields leads to different nbs wave functions and accordingly different potentials , all of them lead to unique scattering phase shift .    in many cases ,",
    "a potential is assumed to be a local single multiplication operator @xmath1 , so that it is expressed as @xmath2 in the coordinate space . in general , however , it is not possible to demand that such an energy - independent and local operator reproduce a set of nbs wave functions for various different energies simultaneously .",
    "thus , in the hal qcd method , the potential is considered to be non - local as an integration operator . the proof is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that such an energy - independent and non - local potential actually exists .",
    "the non - locality of a hal qcd potential is taken into account by the derivative expansion : the potential is expressed as a power series of spatial derivatives , coefficients of which are energy - independent and local functions .",
    "for instance , the leading order of the nuclear force consists of the central and tensor forces , and the next - leading order of the spin - orbit forces .    in practice ,",
    "potentials with higher order derivatives are often inconvenient for either application or their numerical construction .",
    "it is thus desirable to improve the convergence of the derivative expansion .",
    "a possible strategy is to suitably tune the interpolating fields .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to follow this strategy for the following reasons .",
    "first , calculation with varying interpolating fields requires additional numerical costs .",
    "secondly , brute force evaluation of the convergence is challenging ; while nbs wave functions at several energies with sufficient accuracy are necessary in order to implement the derivative expansion , only a limited number of excited states are accessible in lattice qcd , with increasing uncertainty for higher excited states .    in order to make an alternative evaluation of the convergence , a previous study examined the `` energy dependence '' of the hal qcd potential @xcite .",
    "they employed the standard local interpolating fields for the nucleon and computed leading order hal qcd potentials from the nbs wave functions for @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 mev , where the two cases were realized as the ground states under the periodic and the anti - periodic spatial boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "since the derivative expansion was truncated at the lowest order , the energy independence of the potential was only approximate .",
    "results showed that the discrepancy between the two potentials is negligibly small , indicating that these energy - dependent local potentials can be regarded as energy - independent local in this energy region . in this way ,",
    "as far as the nn potential is concerned , the local standard interpolating field turned out to lead to a potential with small non - locality in the low - energy region .",
    "even so , non - locality of a hal qcd potential may play an important role in describing hadron - hadron scattering in higher energy region .",
    "it is desirable to establish general methodology to evaluate the non - locality and to improve the convergence of the derivative expansion . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of hal qcd potentials when the derivative expansion is explicitly performed to higher orders .",
    "since its numerical evaluation requires precision study , we employ a 1 + 1 dimensional non - relativistic coupled - channel model introduced by m.  birse @xcite , which provides analytic nbs wave functions .",
    "we generalize the derivative expansion to avoid a trouble in applying the nave expansion to the model with unsmooth nbs wave functions .",
    "the generalized derivative expansion has several favorable features , which can conveniently be used in lattice qcd monte carlo calculations as well .",
    "the convergence of the generalized derivative expansion is discussed from the viewpoint of potential structure and of scattering phase shift .",
    "the possibility of improving the convergence by tuning the choice of interpolating fields is explicitly examined .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . a coupled - channel model of two - body scattering",
    "is introduced in section [ sec : birse ] .",
    "the model allows for simulating the variation of interpolating fields in a particular way . in section [ sec : potential ] , the hal qcd method is briefly reviewed , followed by generalization of the derivative expansion .",

    "we find that the same problem can also occur in the lattice qcd cases .",

    "variance in @xmath54 can shift the zeros of @xmath293 ( here we explicitly indicate the @xmath54 dependence of @xmath11 ) as @xmath294 moreover , if we determine more than two non - local potentials @xmath295 with different choices of @xmath54 from the same @xmath296 nbs wave functions , all of those potentials manifestly reproduce the input nbs wave functions .",
    "it means that , @xmath295 acts in the same way on @xmath297 for @xmath298 , regardless of @xmath54 .",
    "then it follows that a weighted average of the potentials @xmath299 also reproduces the correct nbs wave functions for these energies .",
    "note that the weight function @xmath300 can be chosen totally arbitrarily as far as the normalization condition   is satisfied .    to be more specific ,",
