    "the diffuse galactic emission ( dge ) is the dominant feature of the @xmath1-ray sky .",
    "it is produced by interactions of crs , mainly protons and electrons , with the interstellar gas ( via @xmath2-production and bremsstrahlung ) and radiation field ( via inverse compton [ ic ] scattering ) .",
    "it is a direct probe of cr fluxes in distant locations , and may contain signatures of physics beyond the standard model , such as dark matter annihilation or decay . however , the interpretation of the dge is complicated by the fact that a large number and variety of discrete sources of @xmath1-rays can also contribute , thus blurring the distinction between individual cr acceleration sites and true diffuse emission processes .",
    "gamma rays from cr interactions with the interstellar medium are also expected from nearby galaxies , and indeed , the egret instrument on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "detected @xmath1-ray emission from the lmc @xcite .",
    "the lmc is an excellent target for studying the link between cr acceleration and propagation and diffuse @xmath1-ray emission because of its proximity and its almost face - on orientation simplifies the interpretation of the diffuse emission versus the dge . in addtion ,",
    "the lmc is host to many supernova remnants , bubbles and superbubbles , and massive star - forming regions that all are potential cr acceleration sites @xcite .",
    "the lat onboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope provides significantly improved capabilities for in - depth studies of the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission from nearby galaxies , and of the lmc in particular @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the initial analysis of measurements of the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission from the lmc taken in the course of the first year s all - sky survey by the lat .",
    "the lat is the primary instrument on _ fermi _ which was launched from cape canaveral on june 11 , 2008 .",
    "the lat is an imaging , wide field - of - view , high - energy @xmath1-ray telescope , convering the energy range @xmath3 mev to @xmath4 gev , that operates according to the pair - conversion principle and is instrumented with a precision tracker and calorimeter , each consisting of a @xmath5 array of 16 modules , a segmented anti - coincidence detector ( acd ) that covers the tracker array , and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system .",
    "the lat has a large @xmath6 sr field of view , and compared to earlier @xmath1-ray missions , has a large effective area ( @xmath7 @xmath8 on axis at @xmath9 gev for the event selection used in this paper ) , improved angular resolution ( @xmath10 68% containment radius at 1 gev for @xmath1-ray conversions in the thin - radiator section of the lat ) and low dead time ( @xmath11 @xmath12s per event ) .",
    "the 1@xmath13 energy resolution in the 100 mev  10 gev energy range is better than @xmath14% .",
    "full details of the instrument , onboard and ground data processing are given in @xcite .",
    "the data used in this work cover the period august 8th 2008 - april 24th 2009 and amounts to 211.7 days of continuous sky survey data taking . during this period a total exposure of @xmath15 @xmath8 s ( at 1 gev ) was accumulated for the lmc region .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper was performed using the lat science tools package , that is available from the _ fermi _ science support centre , with post - launch instrument response functions ( irfs , designated p6v3 ) .",
    "events for the data taking period mentioned above satisfying the standard low - background event selection ( `` diffuse '' events @xcite ) and coming from zenith angles @xmath16 ( to greatly reduce the contribution by earth albedo @xmath1-rays ) were used . to further reduce the effect of earth albedo backgrounds , the time intervals when the earth was appreciably within the field of view ( specifically , when the centre of the field of view was more than 47@xmath17 from the zenith ) were excluded from this analysis .",

    "the binned map has been smoothed using a two - dimensional adaptive gaussian kernel technique @xcite to reduce the effects of poissonian noise .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s.n.r . ) has been set to 10 to reduce statistical noise variations below @xmath19% .",

    "the extinction scales linearly with total gas column ( note , the colour correction method used by @xcite breaks down for the peak of the extinction map due to the massive hii region in the centre of 30 doradus ) .",

    "these background contributions have been estimated by fitting the data with spatial and spectral templates of the different components together with a spatial template for the lmc emission using a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the dge has been modelled using the galprop code @xcite with a model corresponding to the galdef file 54_59xvarh7s . for the combination of extragalactic diffuse emission and residual background we assumed an isotropic component with a power - law spectrum .",
    "crates j060106 - 703606 is modelled as a point source at @xmath30 with a power - law spectrum . for the lmc , we used the sfd extinction map as the spatial template .",
    "the average magnitude of the extinction map is obtained by averaging over all pixels outside a radius of @xmath31 around @xmath32 within the rectangular region . for this figure ,",
    "the pedestal value was subtracted from all pixels in the map .",
    "then , all pixels outside of a radius of @xmath31 centred on @xmath32 are set to zero in order to extract the lmc emission . for the lmc spectral model we assumed a power law .    to describe the morphology of the @xmath1-ray emission from the lmc we initially fit a point source with the position and flux free on top of the background model to the data .",
    "this results in a best - fit point - source position @xmath33 with an error radius @xmath34 95% confidence ( statistical ; the systematic position uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath35 ) .",
    "this position is close to the central star cluster of 30 doradus , r136 , located at @xmath36 which is @xmath37 from our best - fit point - source location .",
    "the detection significance of the lmc can be estimated using the so - called test statistic ( @xmath38 ) which is defined as twice the difference between the log - likelihood , @xmath39 , that is obtained from fitting the lmc model on top of the background model to the data , and the log - likelihood,@xmath40 that is obtained by fitting the background model only , @xmath41 . under the hypothesis",

    "we replaced the point source with an extended source model which was implemented as an axisymmetric two - dimensional gaussian with variable angular size @xmath45 .",
    "we redid the fit for position , flux , spectral index , and angular size and obtained a best - fitting source position @xmath46 ( 95% confidence radius @xmath47 ) and source extent of @xmath48 . the @xmath38 value is 1088.5 with a corresponding significance for source extension compared with the point source hypothesis of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "hi we use the aperture synthesis and multibeam data that @xcite have combined from atca and parkes observations .",
    "for h@xmath51 we use the co observations of the lmc obtained with the nanten telescope @xcite .",
    "we also used the sfd extinction map as tracer of the total gas column density and the 100 @xmath12 m iris map that has been obtained by reprocessing the iras survey data @xcite .",
    "the results of this comparison are summarised together with that of the geometrical models in table  [ tablemaps ] .",
    "the best fits are obtained for the sfd extinction map and the iris 100 @xmath12 m map which give @xmath38 values of 1179.6 and 1179.1 , respectively .",
    "for 2 free parameters ( the total flux in the map and the spectral index ) this corresponds to a detection significance of @xmath52 .",
    "an almost equally good fit is obtained using the hi map .",
    "fitting the co map to the lat data provides a poor fit , suggesting that the @xmath1-ray morphology differs from that of molecular gas in the lmc .",
    "fitting the hi and co maps together confirms this result since @xmath53% of the total flux is attributed to the hi component .",
    "the corresponding increase in @xmath38 with respect to simply fitting the hi map is negligible .    the hi / sfd / iris 100 @xmath12 m maps fit the data considerably better than a single point source , adding further evidence that the observed high - energy @xmath1-ray emission is extended .",
    "furthermore , the two - dimensional gaussian source model is not as good as the tracer maps , suggesting that the emission morphology is more complex than a single gaussian shape .",
    "using the sfd extinction map ( i.e. , our best fitting spatial template of the high - energy emission ) we extract a spectrum for the lmc by fitting the data in 12 logarithmically - spaced energy bins covering the energy range 200 mev  20 gev . above 20 gev ,",
    "photons from the lmc become too sparse in the data set used in this paper to allow for meaningful spectral points to be derived .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the lmc spectrum obtained by this method .",
    "our analysis indicates a spectral steepening of the emission with increasing energy , suggesting a simple power law is an inadequate description of the data .",
    "we confirm this trend by fitting the data using a broken power law instead of a simple power law .",
    "this results in an improvement of the @xmath38 by 10.1 with respect to a simple power law , corresponding to a significance of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for spectral steepening . alternatively",
    ", fitting an exponentially cutoff power law improves the @xmath38 by 7.8 with respect to a simple power law , corresponding to a significance of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) for a spectral cutoff . integrating either model over the energy range 100 mev ",
    "500 gev gives identical photon fluxes of @xmath58 ph cm@xmath24 s@xmath60 and energy fluxes of @xmath61 erg cm@xmath24 s@xmath60 for the lmc .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in these flux measurements is @xmath14% .",
    "the egret team @xcite reported the initial detection of the lmc in high - energy @xmath1-rays based on 4 weeks of data .",
    "due to the limited angular resolution and sensitivity , the emission detected from the lmc was weak and details of the spatial structure of the galaxy were not resolved . however , it was obvious from the egret data that the lmc was an extended @xmath1-ray source .",
    "the lat now clearly resolves the @xmath1-ray emission from the lmc .",
    "the maximum of the emission is attributable to the massive star - forming region 30 doradus .",
    "while this coincidence could be taken as a hint for an enhanced cr density in 30 doradus with respect to the rest of the lmc , we note that a substantial fraction of the interstellar gas of the lmc is also confined to the 30 doradus area .",
    "consequently , the target density for cr interactions is greatly enhanced in this region which implies a corresponding enhancement of the @xmath1-ray luminosity .",
    "in addition , the radiation field in this region is more intense due to the presence of significant numbers of massive , young stars , and this could also result in enhanced ic emission . whether the data also support an enhanced cr density in 30 doradus with respect to the rest of the galaxy requires further analysis .",
    "the poor fit of the co map to the lat data suggests that the overall distribution of @xmath1-ray emission differs from that of the h@xmath51 in the lmc .",
    "the distribution of hi fits the data considerably better and the combined fit of hi and co maps indicates that any contribution to the @xmath1-ray emission that is correlated to the molecular gas is at best marginal .",
    "this agrees well with expectations since the gas budget of the lmc is largely ( 90 - 95% ) dominated by hi @xcite .",
    "consequently we are presently unable to determine the co - to - h2 conversion factor , @xmath62 , from our lmc data .",
    "based on the assumptions of dynamic balance and that the electron / proton ratio in the lmc is the same as in the milky way @xcite predicted a @xmath1-ray flux @xmath0 mev for the lmc galaxy of @xmath63 ph cm@xmath24 s@xmath60 .",
    "more recently , @xcite predicted a @xmath1-ray flux @xmath0 mev @xmath64 ph cm@xmath24 s@xmath60 based on estimates of the lmc supernova rate and total gas densities .",
    "the flux measured by the lat of @xmath58 ph cm@xmath24 s@xmath60 is greater than these model estimates .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the models the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "further studies of the lmc with the lat will concentrate on the spectral analysis of the data , placing particular emphasis on variations of the spectrum throughout the lmc . due to the excellent sensitivity and angular resolution of the lat",
    "this is the first time that such studies are possible .",
    "in addition , other nearby galaxies await detection as @xmath1-ray sources , such as the small magellanic cloud and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 )",
    ". both should be detectable by the lat and the comparative study of their diffuse @xmath1-ray emission will further our knowledge of cr physics in nearby galactic environments and ultimately our own galaxy .    _",
