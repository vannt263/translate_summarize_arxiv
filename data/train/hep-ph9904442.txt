    "compton scattering of real photons ( rcs ) is one of the simplest reactions for obtaining information on the structure of a stable composite system .",
    "when expanded in the frequency of the photon , the leading - order term of the low - energy scattering amplitude is specified by the model - independent thomson limit in terms of the charge and the mass of the target .",
    "genuine structure effects first appear at second order and can be parametrized in terms of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( for an overview see , e.g. , refs .",
    "as there is no stable pion target , the empirical information on the electromagnetic polarizabilities has been extracted from high - energy pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xcite and radiative pion photoproduction off the nucleon @xcite . in principle , the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the pion also enter into the crossed process @xmath2 . however , there is some debate concerning the accuracy of extracting these quantities from the crossed channel @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a precise determination of the pion polarizabilities is of great importance , since ( approximate ) chiral symmetry allows one to predict the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the charged pion in terms of the radiative decay @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "corrections to the leading - order pcac result have been calculated at @xmath4 in chiral perturbation theory and turn out to be be rather small @xcite .",
    "new experiments are presently being carried out @xcite or have been proposed @xcite to significantly reduce the uncertainties in the empirical results and thus subject the predictions of chiral symmetry to a stringent test .",
    "clearly , the possibilities to investigate the structure of the target increase substantially if virtual photons are used , because energy and three - momentum can be varied independently and , furthermore , the longitudinal component of the transition current can be explored .",
    "in particular , virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the nucleon , as tested in the reaction @xmath5 , has attracted considerable interest ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the pion - vcs amplitude of @xmath0 can , in principle , be studied through the inelastic scattering of high - energy pions off atomic electrons , @xmath6 .",
    "such events are presently analyzed as part of the selex e781 experiment @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the vcs reaction @xmath0 in the framework of chiral perturbation theory at @xmath1 .",
    "we will first give a short survey of chiral perturbation theory and then define our conventions for the vcs invariant amplitude .",
    "we then discuss the result for the soft - photon and residual amplitudes , respectively .",
    "finally , the model - dependent residual amplitude is analyzed in terms of alternative definitions of generalized polarizabilities .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is based on the chiral @xmath7 symmetry of qcd in the limit of vanishing @xmath8- and @xmath9-quark masses .",
    "the assumption of spontaneous symmetry breaking down to @xmath10 gives rise to three massless pseudoscalar goldstone bosons with vanishing interactions in the limit of zero energies .",
    "these goldstone bosons are identified with the physical pion triplet , the nonzero pion masses resulting from an explicit symmetry breaking in qcd through the quark masses .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the pion interaction is organized in a so - called momentum expansion , @xmath11 where the subscripts refer to the order in the expansion .",
    "interactions with external fields , such as the electromagnetic field , as well as explicit symmetry breaking due to the finite quark masses , are systematically incorporated into the effective lagrangian .",
