    "the particular spherical two - dimensional system that we focus on is the multielectron bubble in liquid helium .",
    "when a flat surface of helium is charged with electrons above a critical charge density , an instability occurs with the surface opening to subsume a large number of electrons forming a bubble .",
    "these multielectron bubbles ( mebs ) are typically micron - sized cavities inside liquid helium , containing a nanometer thin film of electrons on the inner surface of the bubble . the cavity is forced open by the coulomb repulsion of the electrons which is balanced by the surface tension of the helium .",
    "the equilibrium shape of the bubble is spherical , with a radius @xmath0 determined by the number of electrons and the pressure on the helium .",
    "the bare single electron states on the surface of the spherical bubble are angular momentum eigenstates and have discrete energies , characterized by the angular momentum @xmath1 and with degeneracy @xmath2 . at low temperature",
    "there will be a well defined fermi surface located at the highest occupied state .",
    "small - amplitude shape oscillations , including surface waves , can be quantized as spherical ripplons .",
    "the electrons can interact with these ripplons , and we will show that this leads to an attractive effective interaction between electrons .",
    "this paper has two distinct but interwoven parts . in the first part ( section ii ) we discuss in detail how the interactions between electrons and ripplons in the bubble can lead to a cooper pairing scenario .",
    "the goal of the first part is to show that a bcs - type hamiltonian provides a plausible description of the electronic system in multielectron bubbles at low temperatures , and to illustrate the relevant values of the parameters of the model hamiltonian . in the second part ( sections iii - iv ) we investigate the general properties of this hamiltonian using the richardson solution for the reduced bcs  hamiltonian describing pairing e.g. in nanograins .",
    "both the ground state properties and the density of states of a spherical two - dimensional bcs system , are derived and discussed .",
    "first , we investigate the three ingredients of the full hamiltonian : the electronic part , the ripplonic part , and the electron - ripplon coupling . then , we analyze the effective interaction between electrons , resulting from both the coulomb interactions and the ripplon - mediated electron - electron interaction .",

    "it is clear that small energy transfers make the ripplonic part attractive because @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , in general ripplon exchange will indeed occur with @xmath68 .",
    "the reason for this is that the ripplonic energies are much smaller than the electronic level spacing , as can be seen from comparing rows 3 and 4 of table i. for ripplons with @xmath1 smaller than @xmath69 , the absorption or emission of a ripplon with angular momentum @xmath1 can not change the angular momentum of the electron due to energy conservation requirements .",
    "the effective interaction at @xmath68 is @xmath70 the attractive interaction dominates strongly at small @xmath71 since @xmath72 as can be checked for typical bubbles by substituting the values from table i@xmath73 it is strongest for small @xmath1 and decreases roughly as @xmath74 : @xmath75 the strength of the effective interaction is @xmath76 .",

    "all these processes are indistinguishable ( initial and final states are exactly the same ) and their diagrams should be added to get the overall amplitude .",

    "but , as we shall see in the next section , pair correlations occur only in levels close to @xmath106 where the @xmath1-dependence of the interaction amplitude can be neglected .",

    "this effective hamiltonian for electrons pairing due to an attractive interaction brought about by ripplon exchange can be solved by introducing a variational many body wave function as in the bcs treatment .",
    "however , we chose to apply the richardson method  @xcite , initially developed in the context of nuclear physics and recently reintroduced  @xcite to the condensed matter community to describe superconductivity in nanosize metallic grains .",
    "this method is particularly suitable for finite systems with a discrete level structure such as the multielectron bubble .",
    "having argued that multielectron bubbles are a suitable candidate to observe pairing of electrons in a spherical two - dimensional system , we will apply the richardson model to the effective pairing hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) to gain insight in the properties of the paired phase .",
    "note that the analysis here can be applied to the general problem of a s2deg with attractive interactions between electrons on the same angular momentum level .",
    "the previous section provides possible values for the coupling constant @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and for the relevant energy scales ( see table i ) , and a justification for the applicability of the effective pairing hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) to multielectron bubbles specifically .",
    "nevertheless the results derived in this section can be used to investigate other systems such as the superconducting properties of thin electronic nanoshells , or can be investigated as an academic question regarding spherical electronic systems .",
    "the richardson model provides a method of solution for the so - called reduced bcs hamiltonian @xcite:@xmath109 now consider the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) that we derived in the previous section , and collect all terms that contain operators working on the angular momentum level @xmath1:@xmath110 note that only electrons within the same angular momentum energy level @xmath1 interact : only _ _",
    "intra__level interactions take place , but no _ _ inter__level interactions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relevant ripplon energies are much smaller than the interlevel energy splitting ( see table i for typical values in multielectron bubbles ) .",
    "so , the set of electrons with a given angular momentum @xmath1 can be considered as an independent subsystem , described by the hamiltonian  ( [ hl ] ) .",
    "the full system is the collection of independent subsystems characterized by different @xmath1 .",
    "the full hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is just the sum of the hamiltonians ( [ hl ] ) describing independent subsystems with different @xmath1 : @xmath111 moreover , each of the hamiltonians ( [ hl ] ) corresponds to a reduced bcs hamiltonian ( [ hrich ] ) that can be solved with the richardson method .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath112 and @xmath113 brings ( [ hl ] ) into the same form as ( [ hrich ] ) .",
    "so , we have a collection of independent systems ( each characterized by a particular value of @xmath1 ) that can each be solved by the richardson method .",
    "as shown by richardson  @xcite , the exact solution of the reduced bcs hamiltonian for @xmath114 electron pairs amounts to solving a set of @xmath114 nonlinear coupled equations . in general , the aforementioned set of equations can be solved only by numerical computation .",
    "however , in the particular case when all the involved single - particle states belong to one an the same energy level  as is the case for a spherical multielectron bubble  the energy of electron pairs can be easily found analytically ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",

    "the number of such pairs with given @xmath1 is @xmath122 and it has to be less than or equal to @xmath2 .",

    "the states @xmath119,@xmath120 are then blocked for scattering of pairs .",
    "the number of these blocked spin - degenerate bare states equals the number of unpaired electrons , and is denoted by @xmath117 .",

    "note that @xmath126 corresponds to the ground state for the correlated pairs .",
    "the total energy can be expressed as a sum of the energies for each independent subsystem : @xmath127 the state of the entire system is characterized by a large set of quantum numbers , three ( @xmath128 ) for each angular momentum subsystem .      how do we characterize the ground state of electrons in a spherical bubble with pairing interactions ? in bulk bcs superconductors only electrons in an energy band of the debye energy @xmath129 around the fermi level participate in the pairing . however , in the present case , the relevant ripplon frequencies are much smaller than the splitting between consecutive @xmath1 levels near the fermi energy . therefore one might argue that pairing correlations only take place in the one subsystem with @xmath28 where @xmath130 is the angular momentum at the fermi level . indeed , all levels above the fermi level ( @xmath131 ) are empty , and all levels below the fermi level ( @xmath132 ) are completely filled so that no pairing correlations can be achieved by ripplon - mediated scattering .",
    "yet this turns out to be wrong .",
    "the main difference between pairing in the present case and pairing in conventional superconductors is that in conventional bcs superconductors the gap @xmath133 is much smaller than the relevant phonon energy ( @xmath134 ) , whereas in the present case the interaction energy per electron can be larger than the relevant ripplon energies ( @xmath135 ) and even larger than the level splitting ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this can be inferred by comparing the interaction strengths listed in table ii to the ripplon energies and level splittings reported in table i. it then becomes energetically advantageous to redistribute the electrons amongst the energy levels @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , by promoting a pair of electrons from a level @xmath137 below the fermi level @xmath138 to a level @xmath139 above the fermi level ( @xmath140 ) , both these levels @xmath141 can also form pairing correlations .",
    "the energy gain by forming pairing correlations is larger than the energy needed to promote the electrons form level @xmath137 to level @xmath142 .",
    "so we obtain the remarkable result that for sufficiently large interaction strength @xmath107 ( as we think is the case for mebs ) , although only intralevel scattering can take place , still levels well below and above the fermi level can be affected .    to see this in more detail ,",
    "let us consider for example a bubble with an even number of electrons .",

    "the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ detransfer ] ) represents the energy cost in promoting a pair of electrons from level @xmath1 to level @xmath148 , and the second term corresponds to the gain in energy due to pairing correlations .",
    "as seen from ( [ detransfer ] ) , such a transfer reduces the total energy if the inequality @xmath149 is satisfied .",
