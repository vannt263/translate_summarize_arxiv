    "feedback control theory has recently been further extended to cover even quantum systems such as a single atom .",
    "the methodologies are broadly divided into two categories : measurement - based feedback control and _ non_-measurement - based one called the _ coherent feedback control_. below we briefly describe their major difference and particularly a specific feature of the latter control strategy .",
    "quantum ( continuous - time ) measurement produces useful information ( which is of course a continuous - time signal ) that can be fed back to the system of interest , though at the same time it introduces unavoidable _ back - action _ noise into the system @xcite .",
    "a number of investigation of this trade - off have discovered several situations where the measurement - based feedback control has clear benefits @xcite , for instance an application to quantum error correction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coherent feedback ( cf ) control @xcite takes a totally different approach .",
    "the general structure of the cf control is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ; the system outputs a  quantum signal \" , then the controller , which is also a quantum system , coherently modulates the output and feeds it back to control the system . in this scheme",
    "any measurement is not performed , implying that no excess measurement back - action noise is introduced into the system . because of this feature the cf control is suitable for dealing with problems of _ noise reduction _ , which is the central topic in the control theory .",
    "actually we find that the very successful noise - reducing controllers , the @xmath0 and the linear quadratic gaussian controllers , have natural cf control analogues @xcite .        here",
    "we mention about a _ squeezed state _",
    "@xcite ; this is a purely non - classical state where the fundamental quantum noise is reduced below the quantum noise limit in one of the quadrature observables such as the position @xmath1 and the momentum @xmath2 ( a more detailed description will be given in section ii ) .",
    "therefore , a situation in which noise reduction via the cf control shows the best efficiency may appear in problems of generating squeezed states .",
    "actually yanagisawa @xcite and gough @xcite theoretically showed that this idea works in the case of quantum optics .",
    "1  ( b ) illustrates the cf loop structure they studied .",
    "the quantum system , which now corresponds to an _ optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) _ , has an ability of noise reduction ; that is , it transforms an input _ coherent state _ into an output squeezed state .",
    "it was then shown that the performance of squeezing can be enhanced by constructing an appropriate cf controller , which in this case is given by a _ beam splitter _ with tunable transmissivity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report the first experimental demonstration of the above - mentioned cf control on optical field squeezing , which well agrees with the theory that carefully takes into account the effects of the actual laboratory setup , particularly time delays and losses in the feedback loop .",
    "the results are significant in the sense that , both theoretically and experimentally , they clarify the situation where the cf control is really effective and the limitation on how much it can improve the system performance practically . note that in @xcite a realistic closed loop model was not considered , hence such benefit and limitation are first clarified in this paper .",
    "another important remark is that , while mabuchi has experimentally demonstrated classical noise reduction with the cf control @xcite , in our case we deal with purely non - classical noise reduction that beats the quantum noise limit , which is crucial in quantum information processing . in this sense",
    ", this paper provides the first experimental demonstration of realistic applicability of the cf control to non - classical regime .",
    "in this section we provide some notions of quantum mechanics and the dynamics of an opo . for more details see @xcite .      in quantum mechanics , unlike the classical case , physical quantities must take different values probabilistically when measuring them .",
    "the corresponding statistics is described in terms of a _ state _ , which is represented by a unit vector @xmath3 . in general , when measuring a physical quantity represented by a self - adjoint operator @xmath4 , the mean and variance of the measurement results are respectively given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the adjoint to @xmath3 .",
    "that is , a state corresponds to a probability distribution . for these statistical values to take real numbers , @xmath7 must be self - adjoint ; actually in quantum mechanics any physical quantity is represented by a self - adjoint operator and is called an _",
    "observable_.    a single - mode quantum optical field is described with an operator @xmath8 and its adjoint @xmath9 , which respectively correspond to a complex amplitude and its conjugate of a classical optical field .",
    "these operators satisfy the _",
    "canonical commutation relation ( ccr ) _ @xmath10=\\hat{a}\\hat{a}{^{\\dagger}}-\\hat{a}{^{\\dagger}}\\hat{a}=1 $ ] .",
    "these field operators are not self - adjoint , i.e. , not observables , hence let us define @xmath11 analogous to the classical case , these observables are called the _ amplitude _ and _ phase quadratures_. the ccr for these observables is @xmath12=2i$ ] ; due to this equality , for any state the variances satisfy the _ heisenberg s uncertainty relation _ : @xmath13 this means that the amplitude and phase quadratures can not be determined simultaneously . in other words , there is fundamental uncertainty with respect to these two non - commutative observables .",
    "in particular , it is known that , for any _ classical _ state such as a thermal state , each variance must be bigger than @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; this lower bound is called the _ quantum noise limit",
    "( qnl)_. related to this limit , we here introduce two important states in quantum optics : coherent and squeezed states .",
    "a coherent state is the closest possible analogue to a classical electromagnetic wave , which is generated with a laser device .",
    "the coherent state @xmath17 is defined as an eigenvector of @xmath18 with @xmath19 the corresponding eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 represents a vacuum state .",
    "a crucial property of @xmath17 is that it achieves the qnl , i.e. , we have @xmath22 for any @xmath23 , meaning that a coherent state is a lowest - noise classical state . on the other hand ,",
    "a squeezed state is a purely non - classical state with one of the quadrature variance below the qnl .",
    "in particular , for an ideal pure squeezed state the quadrature variances are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 a unit - less parameter . squeezed states play important roles in quantum information technologies , because for instance _ entanglement _ , which is a key property to perform various quantum information processing , can be generated using squeezed states .",
    "quantum information processing often relies on highly entangled states , and this equivalently means highly squeezed states are desirable .",
    "this is the reason why squeezing enhancement is of vital important .",
    "are mirrors @xmath27 .",
    "a crystal between the curved mirrors @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a second - order nonlinear medium . ]    the _ optical parametric process _ is a widely - used method for generating a squeezed optical field , where a coherent optical field is squeezed by the interaction with a strong pumping field through a nonlinear medium . to produce a squeezed state of light",
    "more effectively , it is common to use the _ optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) _ ; a cavity that contains a second - order nonlinear crystal .",
    "[ opo ] shows a conventional bow - tie type cavity with four mirrors , where the mirror @xmath30 ( input - output port ) is partially transmissive and the others are highly reflective for the fundamental optical field .",
    "all the mirrors are perfectly transparent for the pumping field .",
    "this system renders the input coherent field @xmath31 interact with the medium many times inside the cavity and finally produces a well - squeezed field @xmath32 at the output port .",
    "these input and output fields couple to the internal cavity field @xmath33 through the mirror @xmath30 characterized by the power transmissivity @xmath34 .",
    "losses inside the opo are modeled as a coupling between @xmath35 and an unwanted vacuum field @xmath36 through one of the end mirror @xmath37 with the transmissivity @xmath38 .",
    "here we assume that such interactions occur instantaneously , implying that the outer fields satisfy the ccr @xmath39=\\delta ( t - t')$ ] and @xmath40=\\delta ( t - t')$ ] .",
    "let us describe the dynamics of the cavity field @xmath33 , which is on resonant with the outer fields . in quantum mechanics , any observable @xmath41 changes in time according to the _ heisenberg equation",

    "the heisenberg equation of @xmath33 that involves the coupling to the outer fields is given by the following _ quantum langevin equation _",
    "@xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the damping rates with @xmath52 the optical path length in the opo and @xmath53 the speed of light .",
    "the outer fields satisfy the following boundary condition : @xmath54 the single - input and single - output linear system given by eqs . and",
    "is the system generating a squeezed state of light .",
    "as in the classical case , a simple input - output relation is found in the fourier domain @xmath55 , where we have moved to the rotating frame at frequency @xmath45 by setting @xmath56",
    ". we will deal with for instance @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that corresponds to @xmath31 and @xmath59 , respectively . as a result we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to evaluate the squeezing ,",

    "are defined in the same form as eq . .",

    "in particular , when the input field is a vacuum state , we have @xmath71 if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 , which is the qnl . but",
    "a squeezed state of light is generated when @xmath74 ; actually for simplicity in the case @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 one of which is below the qnl .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath46 determines which quadrature is squeezed or _ anti_-squeezed .",
    "the basic idea of the cf control for optical squeezing enhancement is found in @xcite .",
    "we here study a realistic model corresponding to an actually constructed optical system in the laboratory , which takes into account time delays and losses in the feedback loop .",

    "b. in this cf control scheme , a beam splitter ( bs ) plays the roles of both a controller and an input - output port .",
