    "rating scales ( also called assessment scale ) are used to elicit data about quantitative entities ( e.g. , research collaboration as in @xcite ) .",
    "often , predictability of rating scales ( also called `` assessment scales '' ) could be improved .",
    "rating scales often use values : `` 1 to 10 '' and some rating scales may have over 100 items ( questions ) to rate .",
    "other popular terms for rating scales are : _ survey _ and _ questionnaire _ although a questionnaire is a method of data collection while survey may not necessarily be conducted by questionnaires . some surveys may be conducted by interviews or by analyzing web pages .",
    "rating itself is very popular on the internet for `` customer reviews '' where often uses five stars ( e.g. , by amazon.com ) instead of ordinal numbers .",
    "one may regard such rating as a one item rating scale .",
    "surveys are used in @xcite on fig.1 ( with the caption : `` sketch of data integration in use for different purposes with interference points for standardisation '' ) as one of the main sources of data .",
    "a survey , based on the questionnaire , answered by 1,704 researchers from 86 different countries , was conducted by the scientometrics study @xcite on the impact factor , which is regarded as a controversial metric .",
    "rating scales were also used in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , a different type of the rating scale improvement",
    "was used ( based on pairwise comparisons ) .",
    "the evidence of improving accuracy by pairwise comparisons is in @xcite and @xcite .    according to @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... the differentiation of sciences can be explained in a large part by the diffusion of generic instruments created by research - technologists moving in interstitial arenas between higher education , industry , statistics institutes or the military .",
    "we have applied this analysis to research on depression by making the hypothesis that psychiatric rating scales could have played a similar role in the development of this scientific field . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the absence of a well - established unit ( e.g. , one kilogram or meter ) for measuring the science compels us to use rating scales .",
    "they have great application to scientometrics for measuring and analyzing performance based on subjective assessments . even granting academic degrees",
    "is based on rating scales ( in this case , several exams which are often given to students by questionnaires ) .",
    "evidently , we regard this rating scale as accurate otherwise our academic degrees may not have much value .",
    "the importance of subjectivity processing was driven by the idea of _ bounded rationality _ , proposed by herbert a. simon ( the nobel prize winner ) , as an alternative basis for the mathematical modelling of decision making .",
    "data collected by a rating scale with fixed number of items ( questions ) are stored in a table with one decision ( in our case , binary ) variable .",
    "the parametrized classifier is usually created by total score of all items .",
    "outcome of such rating scales is usually compared to external validation provided by assessing professionals ( e.g. , grant application committees ) .",
    "our approach not only reduces the number of items but also sequences them according to the contribution to predictability .",
    "it is based on the receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) which gives individual scores for all examined items .",
    "the term `` receiver operating characteristic '' ( roc ) , or `` roc curve '' was coined for a graphical plot illustrating the performance of radar operators ( hence `` operating '' ) .",
    "a binary classifier represented absence or presence of an enemy aircraft and was used to plot the fraction of true positives out of the total actual positives ( tpr = true positive rate ) vs. the fraction of false positives out of the total actual negatives ( fpr = false positive rate ) .",
    "positive instances ( p ) and negative instances ( n ) for some condition are computed and stored as four outcomes a 2 2 contingency table or confusion matrix , as follows :    .the confusion matrix [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results revealed that the reliability of the reduced model cr = .822 and is lower than the reliability of the full model of 0.1 ( cr=.929 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the reliability of the scale is above the acceptability level . removing 15 items",
    "has not impaired its reliability as tab .",
    "[ tab : tabcrvr ] demonstrates it .    for the reduced model , ve=.438 while for the given model , ve=.394 . evidently , the new model has ve closer to criterion of .500 .",
    "the reduced rating scale model has a better ve than the full rating scale model .",
    "it means that the reduced rating scale model explains the diversity of the results better than the full rating scale model ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : tabcrvr ] ) .    on the basis of factor loadings ( @xmath0 ) , we are unable to determine which items have the most predictive power .",
    "items v3 or v20 have one of the top factor loadings in the full rating scale , but they do not still have the most predictive power . therefore",
    ", it is impossible to indicate the ordinal number of the rating scale item according to the factor analyses , but it is possible by the proposed method and grm .",
    "however , grm can not compare its solution with a diagnostic criterion while the proposed method can .",
    "the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) was selected for our study since it is one of the best known and most widely used self - rating scales to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms @xcite .",
    "our data were collected in high schools @xcite .",
    "however , it needs to be stressed that our method is applicable to practically all rating scales .",
    "in summary , both models fit the data well .",
    "both of them have a good reliability and a relatively good variance . reducing the number of items did not burden psychometric properties , but simplified the whole structure ( as indicated by the smaller number of degrees of freedom ) . according to the occam s razor law , the simpler models , the better .",
    "although it was not the main objective of this study , it is worth to notice that the six rating scale items have a better predictive power in our study than other 21 items .",
    "we have also demonstrated that our results have the domain ( semantic ) meaning .",
    "the presented method has reduced the number of the rating scale items ( variables ) to 28.57% ( from 21 to 6 ) making over 70% of collected data unnecessary .",
    "it is not only an essential budgetary saving , as data collection is usually expensive , but it often contributes to the data collection error reduction .",
    "the more data are collected , the more errors are expected to occur . when we use the proposed auc roc reduction method , the predictability has increased by approximately 0.5% .",
    "it may seem insignificant but for a large population , it is not so .",
    "in fact , @xcite states that : `` taken together , mental , neurological and substance use disorders exact a high toll , accounting for 13% of the total global burden . ''",
    "the proposed use of auc for reducing the number of rating scale items is innovative and applicable to practically all rating scales .",
    "system r code is posted on the internet for the general use .",
    "a package for system r is under development .",
    "certainly , more validation cases would be helpful and the assistance will be provided to anyone who wishes to try this method using his / her data .",
    "the source code will be deposited at sourceforge.net hosting provider ( see @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , sourceforge `` creates powerful software in over 400,000 open source projects ans hosts over 3.7 million registered users '' .",
    "it connects well over 40 million customers with more than 4,800,000 downloads a day .",
