    "high - energy electro - disintegration of the deuteron is a powerful tool to investigate , first , how and when at larger energies and momentum transfers the description in terms of hadrons ( nucleons and mesons ) transforms into the one in terms of quarks and gluons and , second , the colour transparency ( ct ) effects predicted by qcd . in terms of relevant feynman diagrams , one expects that whereas at comparatively low energies virtual nucleons and mesons with standard propagators can be used , at large enough virtualities such a description gradually becomes invalid . to clearly see this phenomenon one has to be able to reach high enough virtualities in the process , which can be achieved by choosing the kinematics forbidden for free ( on - mass - shell ) nucleons ,",
    "i.e. the so - called _ cumulative _ kinematics , which corresponds to values of the bjorken scaling variable larger than one ( note that the importance of studying the @xmath5-dependence of ct was first stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the pwia",
    "the cross - sections are directly related to the behaviour of the deuteron wave function .",
    "however such a direct relation is broken by fsi , which naively are expected to be large in the cumulative region ; it is here that ct effects are to be taken into account .",
    "ct predicts that at high @xmath8 fsi become small , so that , in principle , choosing both @xmath5 and @xmath8 large enough one can neglect fsi and have access , via the pwia , to the high - momentum behaviour of the nuclear wave function .",
    "it is of particular importance that for high values of @xmath5 and @xmath8 the rescattering energy may be quite small  @xcite , so that only two - nucleon intermediate states can be considered and the simplest feynman diagrams with only nucleon lines ( although at high virtuality ) have to be evaluated . in such a kinematical situation",
    "ct effects can originate from the virtual excitation of the ejectile .    in this study",
    "we investigate the relative role of fsi and ct effects in the deuteron electro - disintegration , using an approximate picture in which the spins are altogether averaged out . taking the relativistic spin into account , apart from purely technical difficulties",
    ", inevitably introduces a variety of unknown off - shell components of both the electromagnetic production vertex and the rescattering amplitude , which deprives the results of any predictive power . to relate our absolute cross - sections to the experimental data we introduce an effective electromagnetic form factor , chosen to reproduce the pwia results with full relativistic spins  @xcite . in our approach ct",
    "is introduced on the hadronic level using its equivalence to the final formation time ( fft ) effect  @xcite .",
    "separating the leptonic part , the process we are going to study is ^*(q)+d(2p)n(p_1)+n(p_2 ) , [ process1 ] where 4-momenta are denoted in brackets . the total c.m .",
    "energy squared in the process is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the deuteron mass .",
    "the cumulative region we are going to study corresponds to @xmath11 from eq .",
    "( [ esse ] ) one concludes that at @xmath5 close to 2 the c.m .",
    "energy remains close to the threshold even if @xmath8 is large , so that only the lowest two - nucleon intermediate states can be considered .",
    "the calculation of the cross - section for the process ( [ process1 ] ) then reduces to the evaluation of the square modulus of the two standard diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 , which correspond to the pwia and rescattering contributions , respectively .    3.5 in    our final expression for the inclusive process e(l)+d(2p)e(l)+x [ process2 ] can be standardly expressed through the hadronic tensor @xmath12 , which is just the square of the two amplitudes shown in fig.1 integrated over the momenta of the two final nucleons .",
    "it can be shown that in order to obtain the exclusive cross - section for the lepto - disintegration , averaged over the azimuthal angles , it is sufficient to drop this integration .",
    "the pwia contribution to the amplitude is just the hadronic matrix element of the electromagnetic current j_^pwia=2(q^2)k_g(k_1 ^ 2 ) , [ incl ] where @xmath13 is the effective electromagnetic form - factor of the ( scalar ) nucleon , the vector @xmath14 is chosen to guarantee conservation of the electromagnetic current , and @xmath15 is the momentum of the active nucleon before the interaction .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the relativistic deuteron wave function , which in principle can be sought as a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the deuteron .",
    "however the relativistic potential for this equation is unknown at high momentum transfers and virtualities , so rather than use forms for this potential fitted to comparatively low energy and momentum transfer scattering , we directly approximate @xmath17 using as a guide its non - relativistic limit . to calculate the rescattering contribution we choose a system with @xmath18 ( `` lab '' system for reaction ( [ process1 ] ) ) which simplifies the integrations over the intermediate nucleon momenta . in this system",
    "the integration over @xmath19 puts either the spectator or the active nucleon on the mass - shell , depending on whether @xmath20 is lower or higher than @xmath21 . in both cases , as in the pwia contribution , the integrand involves only the relativistic deuteron wave function with one of the nucleons on its mass shell .    as a result",
    "we find the rescattering contribution to the matrix element of the hadronic current in the form j_^resc=2(q^2 ) dv(k_1,k_2)k_g(v ) , [ jresc ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the rescattering amplitude , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 having different forms in the two mentioned regions of integrations .",
    "all invariant arguments entering the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ jresc ] ) have to be expressed through the light - cone integration variables , taking into account that either @xmath27 , or @xmath28 .",
    "the total hadronic tensor is obtained as w_=dv(p_1,p_2)(j_^pwia+j_^resc ) ( j_^pwia+j_^resc)^ * , [ wtot ] where @xmath29 is the standard invariant phase volume for the produced nucleons .",
    "as far as ct is concerned , we introduce it via the fft of the hit hadron , which manifests itself through a dependence of the scattering amplitudes and verteces on the virtuality of the hit hadron after @xmath30 absorption ( see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the effect of this dependence can be modelled by a monopole form - factor , which is equivalent to changing the ejectile propagator as follows - .",
    "[ denom ] this substitution is equivalent to assuming that there are two different ejectile states with masses @xmath31 and @xmath32 whose contribution to rescattering cancels out in the limit of high momenta , in agreement with the underlying ideas of ct [ 3 ] . following refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , we choose for the mass @xmath32 the value 1.8 gev .",
    "3.0 in    we parametrize the relativistic deuteron wave function @xmath33 using as a guide the nucleon density in the deuteron at comparatively low momenta . in the non - relativistic limit one obtains g^2(k^2)=2m(2)^3|(*k*^2)| ,",
    "* k*^2=(m^2-k^2-m ) , where @xmath34 is the deuteron binding energy . for @xmath35 we have taken the form which corresponds to the av14 interaction  @xcite .",
    "as for the rescattering amplitude , it was chosen in the form a(s , t)=(+i)^tot(s)e^bt , with the values of the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 taken from  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , our main goal was to estimate the magnitude of the fsi and the influence of ct ( or , equivalently , fft ) in the cumulative region .",
    "accordingly , our basic quantities to be calculated are the ratios of the rescattering to the pwia contributions . we expect that the error due to neglecting spins is reduced in these ratios",
    ". still , to have a clearer physical picture and to be able to compare with the experimental data , we also tried to calculate absolute values of the cross - sections . to this end",
    "we introduced an effective electromagnetic form - factor for the active nucleon , chosen to approximately take into account magnetic interaction of both the proton and neutron .",
    "comparison of our impulse approximation with the results obtained with a full account of spins [ 2 ] leads to the choice ^2(q^2)=_d^2(q^2 ) , [ formfactor ] where @xmath39 is the standard dipole form - factor , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron . with this choice",
    "our pwia results practically coincide with the ones with full relativistic spins taken into account .",
    "the inclusive cross - sections for the process ( [ process2 ] ) have been calculated at points corresponding to the experimental data of  @xcite , with the initial electron energy @xmath42 gev and scattering angle @xmath43 .",
    "we have considered values for the final electron energy which cover the region of @xmath5 in the interval @xmath44 .",
    "some relevant kinematical values characterizing the chosen points are listed in table 1 .",
    "3.5 in -10 mm    -1.5 in    .some kinematical variables in the inclusive electro - disintegration cross section corresponding to the kinematics of of  @xcite , _ viz _ incident electron energy @xmath45 and scattering angle @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the energy transfer , @xmath5 the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath8 the square 4-momentum transfer , @xmath48 the produced invariant mass , and @xmath49 the the momentum of the struck nucleon in the system where the spectator is at rest @xmath49 .",
    "note that the inelastic threshold corresponds to @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) ( cf .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    it can be seen , that at high values of @xmath5 ( high cumulativity ) @xmath49 is small , well below the threshold energy for pion production .",
    "this justifies our approach based on the assumption that only nucleon degrees of freedom are relevant ; however at smaller @xmath5 @xmath49 grows and such an assumption becomes of disputable validity .    2.5 in    in fig .",
    "2 the ratios of the full cross section ( which includes fsi with or without fft ) to the pwia cross section is shown .",
    "it can be seen that the rescattering contribution , which is very small at @xmath52 , steadily grows with @xmath5 , reaching an order of about 50% already at @xmath53 .",
    "the relative role of fft ( or ct ) also rises with @xmath5 . at",
    "the maximum value of @xmath5 studied , @xmath54 , fft effects decrease fsi by @xmath7% .",
    "this however does not make fsi smaller than the pwia contribution , so that they can not be neglected at all .",
    "let us now discuss the exclusive cross - section @xmath55 . in order to minimize the error of neglecting spins",
    ", we consider the reduced cross - section n_eff(|*p*_2| ) n_eff(|*p*_2|,x , q^2)=    momentum distribution in the deuteron . here",
    "@xmath56 is the momentum of the unobserved nucleon ( the missing momentum ) .",
    "3 shows the effective momentum distributions _ vs _ the missing momentum at @xmath57 , calculated taking rescattering and fft into account .",
    "calculations have been performed at fixed values of @xmath5 and @xmath8 and different missing momenta @xmath58 . due to energy conservation",
    ", this corresponds to different values of the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "2.7 in -1 mm    in figs .",
    "4 and 5 the effects of rescattering and fft are shown separately at @xmath57 , and in the deep kinematical region , @xmath61 .",
    "it can be seen from fig.4 that at @xmath57 fft effects , as expected , increase with @xmath8 , in agreement with the results obtained for the process @xmath62 (  @xcite ) . at @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "5 ) one observes that with the growth of the missing momentum , fsi appreciably decrease due to fft , which makes the distorted cross - section more similar to the pwia one .",
    "using the feynman diagram technique we have calculated the rescattering contribution to the cross - section of inclusive and exclusive deuteron electro - disintegration , paying particular attention to the cumulative region @xmath2 .",
    "our main goal has been to study ct effects , which we have introduced via the fft of the struck nucleon . in our calculations spins",
    "has been averaged out and all particles were treated as scalar ones . the error introduced by this approximation",
    "is expected to cancel to a large extent in the ratio of the total cross - section ( which includes fsi and fft effects ) , with and without fsi and fft effects , to the pwia cross section . to be able to compare absolute magnitudes of the cross - sections with the experimental data we used an effective electromagnetic vertex for the active nucleon , chosen to describe the pwia results with spins .",
    "the results of our calculations show that the relative magnitude of the fsi steadily grows with @xmath5 . at @xmath63 ( gev / c)@xmath4 and @xmath64",
    ", the rescattering contribution raises the cross - section nearly by a factor of 2.5 , whereas the introduction of fft decreases back the cross section by a factor of 1.6 , which is evidently not enough to disregard fsi altogether .",
    "as expected , at large values of @xmath5 the influence of fft grows up : it can be seen from fig .",
    "5 that at @xmath65 ( gev / c)@xmath4 and @xmath66 gev / c , fft decreases the pure fsi results by a factor of 4 . in conclusion , we have found that the ct or fft effects are clearly visible in the electro - disintegration of the deuteron in the cumulative region , which may serve as a tool for their experimental study .",
    "we have also found that although fft effects decrease the effects of the fsi rather substantially at @xmath67 , this is by far not sufficient to neglect fsi altogether .",
