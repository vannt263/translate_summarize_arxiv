    "this sharp drop implies that galaxies do not retain their exponential light distribution to such faint levels .",
    "( van der kruit 1979 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this marked the detection of truncations at a safe distance of @xmath1 times the radial scalelength , so the paradigm of the exponential disk was not in real danger at the time .",
    "after van der kruit and searle s seminal papers about the structure of galactic disks ( e.g. van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , the matter of imperfectly exponential disks was rather ignored for some more ten years , until barteldrees & dettmar  ( 1994 ) confirmed their existence using for the first time modern ccd equipment , but placed the cut - off closer to the center , for some galaxies at a disturbing close @xmath2 times the scalelength .",
    "finally starting from the year 2000 several groups ( e.g. pohlen et al .",
    "2000 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , florido et al .",
    "2001 , kregel et al .",
    "2002 , pohlen et al .",
    "2002 , or erwin et al .",
    "2005a ) followed up the question of where the disks are truncated , how the shape of the profile in the very outer parts looks like , and if all disks have a truncation .",
    "for a recent review see pohlen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . to keep a long story short our answer",
    "is that we know now that not all galaxies are truncated , but those which are , are now believed to be truncated early ( at @xmath3 ) , often abruptly ( but not completely ) and the profiles are best described as a broken exponential and so probably better called _ breaks _ than _ cut - offs_. the prototypical break is recently observed for m33 by ferguson ( this volume ) using the star - count method as an independent approach compared to the so far purely surface photometric measurements .",
    "the currently favoured origin for these breaks are global star - formation thresholds as described by martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) or schaye ( 2004 ) , although this does not explain the origin of the material beyond the break ( see pohlen et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "what we still need is a complete census of the outer disk structure in the local universe extending the work done by courteau ( 1996 ) and de jong ( 1996 ) including a detailed discussion of the light profile in the outer region to answer our famous question : `` to be or not to be ( truncated ) ? '' .",
    "this is now done and will be presented briefly here and later in detail in pohlen & trujillo ( 2005 , in prep . ) for late - type galaxies and in erwin et al .",
    "( 2005b , in prep . ) for early - type galaxies .",
    "we used the leda online catalogue ( the richest , most complete and up - to - date catalogue with homogeneous parameters of galaxies for the largest available sample ) to select our initial galaxy sample using the following selection criteria : @xmath4 ( sb - sdm ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 km / s , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 b - mag .",
    "this leaves us with an unbiased , volume limited sample of late - type , face - on ( @xmath9 ) , nearby ( local ) disk galaxies ( avoiding the milky way ) .",
    "our sample complements the ccd imaging sample of @xmath10 early - type sb0-sbb galaxies by erwin et al .",
    "( 2005b , in prep . ) .",
    "the actual data we use for our present study come from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , data release 2 ) providing images of @xmath11 ( 98/655 ) of the galaxies in our original leda sample .",
    "to convince the reader , and first of all ourselves , that sdss images with a rather short exposure time of only @xmath12s are indeed deep enough to trace the outer disk we compared for three galaxies sdss images with deep surface photometry .",
    "the deep data is presented in pohlen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and was obtained at the caha 2.2 m telescope using cafos .",
    "the total exposure time of these images is about 3 hours reaching reliably down to @xmath13 r - mag / sqarcsec . as shown in fig.1",
    "( for two of the galaxies ) the agreement is astonishingly good , allowing us to safely use sdss images to study the profile clearly beyond the break radius .",
    "we classify each galaxy profile by eye according to the following nomenclature .",
    "if there is no indication for any obvious break in the profile the galaxy is classified as typei following freeman ( 1970 ) . in the same sense ,",
    "galaxies showing a profile better described as a broken exponential with a clear break and a _ downbending _",

    "although `` not far from the center '' may suggest to exclude truncated galaxies ( where the break is at several radial scalelengths ) from this class , thus following quote allows us to generalise ken s definition :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is worth pointing out that for the @xmath16 ... @xmath17 $ ] galaxies in which the typeii characteristic is most prominent @xmath16e.g .",

    "counting the neighbouring galaxies around each galaxy reveals the fact that typeiii galaxies statistically prefer a high density , typect galaxies a low density environment .",
    "however , this relation is far from being clear - cut .",
    "the break radius for galaxies with classical truncations , the ones discovered by piet van der kruit in 1979 , happens in the r band at @xmath22 ranging between 1.4 and 4.2 .",
    "since we can follow the profile of the typei galaxies down to @xmath23 times their scalelength , they seem to be genuinely untruncated galaxies . while the scalelength varies with filter",
    "( being larger in g compared to r ) as known before , we do not find a systematic difference for the break radius .",
    "we do , however , find that the distribution of the surface brightness at the break radius @xmath24 for galaxies with a classical truncation is peaked around a mean value . together with the absence of a relation between @xmath25 and mass ( rotational velocity ) , this favours a star formation threshold scenario for its origin .",
    "prez ( 2004 , and this volume ) showed that it is possible to detect truncations even out to high redshift ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "so we carefully defined a complete sample of high redshift galaxies ( trujillo & pohlen , 2005 ) using the acs data of the hubble ultra deep field . from the final sample of 36 galaxies ,",
    "21 show truncations . now , using the position of the truncation as a direct estimator of the size of the stellar disk it becomes possible to outright observe inside - out growth of galactic disks comparing the acs to our local sdss sample .",
    "the results suggest that the radial position of the truncation has increased with cosmic time by @xmath27 kpc in the last @xmath28 gyr indicating a small to moderate ( @xmath29 ) inside - out growth of the disk galaxies since @xmath26 ( see trujillo & pohlen , 2005 ) .",
