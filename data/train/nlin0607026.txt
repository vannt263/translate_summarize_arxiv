    "the way in which different economic activities and social groups spread over the urban space is the matter of different and complementary theories in sociology , geography , politics and economy @xcite .",
    "housing patterns can be understood as the result of the complex interrelationship between individuals actions constrained by social , political and economical rules  @xcite .",
    "residential segregation is the degree to which two or more groups live separately from one to another in different parts of the urban space  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is concurrent to several social problems as the concentration of low opportunities to get a well earned job , low scholar development in children of segregated areas , premature parenthood between young people , and the emergence of criminality  @xcite .",
    "residential segregation has been the subject of extensive research in social sciences for many years .",
    "it is a multifactorial phenomenon mainly determined by socioeconomic factors like race and income distribution , as well as factors associated to the structure of the urban space  @xcite .",
    "there are two main quantitative approaches to segregation , the phenomenological one , which relies on segregation measures and indexes  @xcite , and the theoretical one , based on computational or mathematical models  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a spatially extended model based in ideas of portugali  @xcite and schelling  @xcite , to study the relationship between income inequality and residential segregation .",
    "the basic thesis proposed by massey and colleagues  @xcite is that the degree of spatial segregation experienced by a society increases with its level of inequality .",
    "this relationship has been reformulate by morrison  @xcite as the segregation  inequality curve .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly expose the main theoretical studies concerning the residential segregation , emphasizing only the ideas and concepts that are relevant to our research . in section 3",
    ", we present the mathematical model and the tools needed to analyze our numerical simulation , which we do in section 5 .",
    "previous to this , in section 4 we study of asymptotic behavior of the model , and derive some theoretical estimates which we consider for the numerical study .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion about the potential of our model as an explanation tool .",
    "residential segregation is a complex phenomenon with several dimensions of analysis , whose governing mechanisms are hard to identify . in a first approximation",
    "we can however assume that the phenomenon is governed by a set of structural and behavioral rules which determine the possibility of one individual to get a particular kind of house in a specific location of the city .",
    "since those rules are no evident , simplifying hypotheses are required .",
    "one point of view , based in human ecology , postulates that residential segregation occurs because individuals in a city are in mutual competition for the space and its resources . according to this approach , competition is the main force driving the residential segregation  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this competition is determined by the ability of individuals to struggle for advantageous locations in the urban space , _ i.e. _ their dominant capacity , which is constrained by sociocultural and socioeconomic rules  @xcite .",
    "there are three main hypothesis about the sociocultural rules governing the residential segregation . the first one concerns with the class  selective emigration from poor regions .",
    "in a region where coexist both poor and less poor people , the latter tend to emigrate to a more wealthy region .",
    "this mechanism tends to isolate and concentrate poor people , increasing in this way the poverty rate of the region .",
    "the second hypothesis establishes that neighborhood concentration of poor people reflects the general poverty of the urban area . when the average shows a downward trend , neighborhood poverty rates increase .",
    "finally , the third is related the the racial segregation experienced by poor people .",
    "racial bias causes racial segmentation of the urban housing markets , which concurs with high rates of poverty in specific ethnic groups to concentrate poverty geographically  ( * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) .",
    "these hypotheses are complementary , and were developed to explain segregation in north  american cities , where they have been tested .",
    "perhaps in the latin  american case racial and sociocultural factors have a less relevant role , making possible to build an explicative model over socioeconomic considerations only .",
    "taking into account that `` markets are not mere meetings between producers and consumers , whose relations are ordered by the interpersonal laws of supply and demand ''  @xcite , we can formulate socioeconomic rules as market mechanisms .",
    "the housing market is formed by two kinds of agents : residents which are interested in the social and individual value or use of the land commodity , and the entrepreneurs which are interested in the exchange value of the land .",
    "there is a natural conflict between these two of valuations of land .",
    "there is a set of structural factors that are relevant to housing market dynamics : a ) the housebuilding industry ; b ) the government s housing policy ; c ) the structure of the property of land ; d ) the actual spatial structure of city , _ i.e. _ location of labor area , residential areas , and trade  commerce areas ; and e ) the income structure of the society .",
    "the last one has been considered as the most significant for the residential segregation phenomenon .",
    "indeed , urban economic theory explains the formation of segregated cities through two main arguments .",
    "the first one establishes that a population of households with heterogeneous income competing for the occupation of urban land traditionally results in an income  based stratification of the urban space according to the distance to the city center  @xcite .",
    "the second one links the concentration of low incomes households in some areas , to the existence of local externalities like ethnicity . as a consequence of this ,",
    "there is a households preference to live in relative homogeneous neighborhoods with respect to either income or ethnic similarity  @xcite .",
    "two levels of analysis may be considered in the study of residential segregation . at the macro level , several structural transformations in the society ( changes in income level , tendency to racial exclusion , levels of social integration , etc . )",
    "are assumed to determine the spatial concentration of poverty .",
    "this is the level of analysis in  @xcite . at the micro level , specific discriminatory individual behaviors related individual characteristics ( sex , age , religion , ethnic group , nationality , etc . )",
    "influence the choice of a place to live .",
    "this is the point of view in  @xcite , and it is also the one we adopt here .    our model was developed with the purpose of studying massey s thesis  @xcite , which relates the degree of spatial segregation experienced by a society , to its inequality degree ( income disparity ) .",
    "this thesis was reformulated as the segregation ",
    "inequality curve ( see figure  [ segregation - inequality ] ) by morrison  @xcite . more precisely , we intend to determine the relationship between these two quantifiable phenomena , inequality and segregation , in a situation where the whole dynamics is governed basic rules of socioeconomic nature .",
    "[ segregation - inequality ]",
    "our model is inspired in the works of schelling  @xcite and portugali _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite .",
    "like portugali s models , the physical infrastructure of our `` simplified city '' is modeled by a two  dimensional lattice of finite size @xmath0 .",
    "a two  dimensional integer vector @xmath1 represent spatial coordinates . at each time step , the price of the house at location @xmath2 is a positive real number .",
    "each house is occupied by a householders or agent , who can be distinguished only by his / her socioeconomic status .",
    "we quantify this status with a real number taking one of three possible values @xmath3 ( which stands for poor , middle class , and rich respectively ) . at time @xmath4",
    ", each agent occupies one specific house of the city .",
    "houses are identical in their characteristics but differentiable by their prices .",
    "there are two main mechanism setting up the house s prices dynamics : the neighborhood influence , and the householder s economic status .",
    "on the other hand , the agents change position subject to availability , under the pressure of their housing situation .",
    "agents can move inside the city to achieve an optimal match between their status and the price of the house they inhabit .",
    "agents try to live in houses with prices , but not too much , that their economic status .    at time @xmath4 , the prices of houses are encoded in a @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 , while the spatial distribution of agents is stored in a @xmath5 matrix @xmath7 with values in @xmath8 .",
    "the price of that house at time @xmath9 is given by : @xmath10 weights the influence of the mean price on the neighborhood over the house price , and can be thought as an inflationary parameter : the larger @xmath11 the higher the asymptotic mean value of the houses in the city .",
    "the distribution of the agents at time @xmath9 differs from its distribution at time @xmath4 only by a single place exchange between two agents of different status , i.  e. , at time @xmath4 we randomly choose two sites @xmath12 and define @xmath13 this quantity should be interpreted as the economic improvement due to the house exchange between agents a locations @xmath2 and @xmath14 . at each unite time",
    ", only two agents can participate in such a house exchange .",
    "we have @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 and similarly for @xmath14 .",
    "the economic improvement due to a house exchange leads to the reduction on the economic tension @xmath18 agents try to minimize economic tension generated by difference between housing price and status . in our model",
    "this difference plays the same role as the dissatisfaction or the unhappiness in the schelling s model  @xcite .      the segregation  inequality curve gives the relation between two characteristics of the system : inequality and segregation .",
    "the income distribution can be interpreted as a probability vector .",
    "the proportions of the population in each income group would be the probability for an individual to belong to that income group .",
    "with this idea , income inequality can be measure by using theil s inequality index  @xcite .",
    "adapting this index to our situation , we define inequality of a @xmath5 agents distribution @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 where for @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the proportion of agents in each income group .",
    "the inequality so defined is an entropy  like indicator taking values in the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the minimum @xmath24 corresponds to the case where the total population is equally distributed among all the income groups , and maximum to the limit case of a single income group concentrating the whole population .",
    "this last limit would be obtained from distributions where a given income group includes most of the population .",
    "the other characteristic we need to determine the segregation curve is the spatial segregation itself . though measures of segregation have been the subject of several works in sociology  (",
    "* and references therein ) , it is more suitable to our approach to quantify this characteristic by using the degree of order of a given spatial distribution .",
    "the idea is to associate the maximum degree of order to a spatial distribution which can be easily described , like a single cluster or a periodic distribution . on the other hand",
    ", a random distribution would have a low degree of order .",
    "we use an image segmentation technique , the bi ",
    "orthogonal decomposition , to associate a degree of disorder ( the entropy of the bi ",
    "orthogonal decomposition ) , to a given spatial distribution which we treat as an image  @xcite .",
    "thus , to quantify the segregation ( ordering ) of the city , we compare the entropy of the bi ",
    "orthogonal decomposition of the ordered distribution with that corresponding to a random distribution .",
    "orthogonal decomposition is the bi  dimensional generalization of the karhunen ",
    "love transform , but with the advantage that it is sensible to changes in the spatial structure of one image .",
    "to a bi  orthogonal decomposition it is associate an entropy , which measures the amount of information of the image  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is that in an orderer image , _ i.  e. _ an in  homogeneous distribution of pixels showing a spatial pattern , has low entropy , while to a random distribution of pixels corresponds highest entropy .",
    "consider a @xmath5 positive matrix @xmath25 , which is supposed to codify an image or a two  dimensional distribution .",
    "the associate covariance matrix @xmath26 is symmetric , and hence its eigenvalues @xmath27 are real , and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath28 define an orthonormal basis .",
    "orthogonal decomposition allows us to rewrite the matrix @xmath25 as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the contribution of the submatrix @xmath32 to the sum is of the order of the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "the information of the matrix @xmath25 is concentrate in the submatrices associated to eigenvalues with the highest absolute value . for positive @xmath25 ,",
    "we neglect the largest eigenvalue @xmath34 , which can be associated to an spatially homogeneous mode .",
    "using the eigenvalue structure of the bi ",
    "orthogonal decomposition , we define the information contents of @xmath25 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 for an agent distribution @xmath19 , the segregation index is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the expected value of @xmath39 with respect to a random distribution of agents in the @xmath5dimensional lattice .",
    "we have numerically found that @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "in order to understand the asymptotic behavior of the model , let us rewrite ( [ evolval ] ) and([evolstat ] ) in matrix form as follows : @xmath42 where both @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be considered as @xmath5dimensional vectors , @xmath45 is the averaging matrix whose action is defined by ( [ evolval ] ) , and @xmath46 is a permutation matrix which permutes at most two coordinates . if for the chosen coordinates @xmath12 we have @xmath47 , then @xmath46 is the matrix permuting those coordinates , otherwise @xmath46 is the identity matrix .    after a sufficiently large number of iterations , name @xmath48 ,",
    "the agents achieve a spatial distribution @xmath49 which can not be improved .",
    "from that point on , the distribution of housing prices follows the affine evolution @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 the long  term distribution of housing prices is therefore @xmath52 , so that the economic tension associate to the asymptotic distribution of agents is @xmath53    because of the non  deterministic nature of the evolution of our system , the asymptotic distribution @xmath49 is not uniquely determined by initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , it has to satisfy the following `` variational principle '' @xmath54 where the minimum is taken over the set of all two  sites permutations .",
    "this is equivalent to say that asymptotically no location exchange can diminish the economic tension .",
    "for @xmath11 small , a spatially disordered initial distribution of agents @xmath55 remains unchanged , and the system evolves following an affine law , converging to @xmath56 . for each spatially disordered initial distribution @xmath55 , there exists a critical value @xmath57 for which @xmath55 evolves towards an spatially organized state @xmath49 . this distribution is composed by relatively small number of clusters , each one of them consisting of a nucleus of rich agents surrounded by middle class ones , while the lower class agents occupy the space left by the clusters . in our numerical experiments , which we describe below",
    ", we have found that @xmath57 essentially depends on the proportion of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in @xmath55 .    a two sites permutation @xmath61 produces a change in the economic tension @xmath62 according to equation  ( [ variational ] )",
    ", this change does not make the economic tension to decrease . in order for this to be so",
    ", it is necessary that latexmath:[\\[\\label{increase - tension }    each two sites permutation @xmath61 .",
    "we may decompose @xmath64 , as the sum of a constant vector and a fluctuating one .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then equation  ( [ increase - tension ] ) can be written as @xmath67 taking this into account , we may define @xmath57 as , @xmath68 where the maximum is taken over the two  sites permutations . for @xmath69 interchange",
    "coordinates @xmath70 , we have , @xmath71      a reasonably good estimate for @xmath57 can be obtained as follows .",

    "( [ lambda - c1 ] ) , for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 taking this into account , we propose @xmath84 as an estimate for @xmath57 .",
    "suppose that @xmath49 is composed by @xmath86 clusters of comparable size , and suppose also that all of them are symmetric with respect to the coordinate axes .",
    "in this case @xmath49 has a cluster decomposition @xmath87 where @xmath88 corresponds to the @xmath89-th cluster .",

    "this is consistent with an agents distribution @xmath49 formed by @xmath104 clusters , each cluster containing nearly the same number of agents of the less numerous class .",

    "the model proposed here is intended as a tool towards the explanation of the well  known and accepted thesis of massey about the relationship between income inequality and spatial distribution of individuals in a city .",
    "build upon basic rules governing the dynamics of house prices and house holders , this model is able to produce spatial patterns whose degree of order grows with the income inequality of the virtual city .",
    "thus we have a mathematical model of segregation , showing a behavior in accordance to the massey s thesis .",
    "this model introduces a control parameter which we relate to the adjustments of the house prices during the evolution , in a way that segregation occurs only for large enough values of this parameter .",
    "the model does not use a sophisticated housing prices theory , but simple interaction rules similar to those proposed by portugali and benenson . regardless to its validity inside the economic theory , we believe this is a good first approximation for the housing prices dynamics .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the segregation is a location exchange process similar the one proposed by schelling .",
    "this process is driven by the economic tension resulting from the difference between the `` economic power '' of the house holders and prices of the houses they occupy .    though our model retains many of the schelling s ideas , the main difference is nature of the location exchange decision . in schelling s original model ,",
    "this decision is taken based on a satisfaction function that takes in account the number of neighbors of the same kind around a given agent . in our case , an agent decides to exchange is location according to the difference between its income and the price of its house .",
    "we think that this is a more realistic situation in the sense that that economic tension can be measure in real life .",
    "this mechanism is also better suited for a model of a society where ethnic differences are less determinant than differences imposed by the income .    from the theoretical point of view , the model is interesting by its own .",
    "it exhibits an order  disorder phase transition via clustering produced from a very simple exchange mechanism .",
    "it also appears to present some finite size scaling behavior which would be pertinent to further explore .",
    "concerning the indicators we use , theil s is a widely accepted inequality index , with the advantage that it is easy to compute and has a direct interpretation . our segregation index , on the other hand",
    ", have never been used in this context .",
    "besides this indicator , we previously tried other entropy  like measures of the degree of order in a spatial distribution , as well as some direct clustering measures .",
    "we chose the entropy of the bi ",
    "orthogonal decomposition because it is almost as easy to compute as the theil s index , and it has a natural interpretation as the information contents of a picture .",
    "we are convinced that other segregation measures commonly used in the sociological literature are no suited for our purposes , mainly because they are built from a previous organization of the data , e.  g. , the census tracks . in our case , the structuration of the urban space is a result only of the location exchange dynamics .    summarizing , our model is built from a very simple location exchange rule , based on interaction between agents through an economic tension produced by the difference between the agents economic capacity and the prices of the houses they occupy .",
    "this simple mechanism is sufficient to produce spatial segregation in accordance to massey s thesis : segregation is an increasing function of the inequality . with this",
    "we were able to furnish key components of an explanatory model of spatial segregation in a situation where the economic factors are more significant than either ethnic or cultural ones .",
