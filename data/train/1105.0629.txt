    "some concluding remarks are presented at the end of the paper .",
    "in this section , the classical lie symmetry method for the k - s equation has been performed .",
    "first , we recall the general procedure for determining symmetries for an arbitrary system of partial differential equations @xcite . to begin , consider a general system of partial differential equation containing @xmath17 dependent and @xmath18 independent variables as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents all the derivatives of @xmath21 of all orders from 0 to @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 in the above could be @xmath36 and @xmath37 coordinates . by theorem",
    "( 6.5 ) in @xcite , the invariance condition for the k - s is given by the relation : @xmath38=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the invariance condition ( ) is equivalent with the following equation : @xmath39 substituting ( ) into invariance condition ( ) , we are left with a polynomial equation involving the various derivatives of @xmath40 whose coefficients are certain derivatives of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . since , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "depend only on @xmath36 , @xmath45 , @xmath37 , @xmath46 we can equate the individual coefficients to zero , leading to the complete set of determining equations : @xmath47 by solving this system of pdes , we find that :    the lie group of point symmetries of k - s ( 1.1 ) has a lie algebra generated by the vector fields @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary constants .",
    "infinitesimal generators of every one parameter lie group of point symmetries of the k - s are : @xmath51 the commutator table of symmetry generators of the k - s is given in table 1 , where the entry in the @xmath52 row and @xmath53 column is defined as @xmath54=v_iv_j - v_j v_i,\\ \\",

    "the equation ( 1.1 ) can be regarded as a submanifold of the jet space @xmath68 .",
    "so we can find the most general group of invariant solutions of equation ( 1.1 ) . to obtain the group transformation which is generated by the infinitesimal generators @xmath69 for @xmath70",
    ", we need to solve the seven systems of first order ordinary differential equations , @xmath71 exponentiating the infinitesimal symmetries of equation ( 1.1 ) , we get the one parameter groups @xmath72 generated by @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "the one - parameter groups @xmath75 generated by the @xmath76 , are given in the following table : @xmath77 where entries give the transformed point @xmath78    these operators which generate invariance of the evolution equation ( 2 ) corre- spond to the following transformations : u0 generate temporal translation , u1 and u4 galilean boosts , u2 spatial dilatation and gauge transformation , u3 a gauge transformation , u5 a spatial rotation , u6 and u7 spatial translations .",
    "+ recall that in general to each one parameter subgroups of the full symmetry group of a system there will correspond a family of solutions called invariant solutions .",
    "consequently , we can state the following theorem :    if @xmath79 is a solution of equation ( 1.1 ) , so are the functions @xmath80    thus , from above theorem we conclude that :    for the arbitrary combination @xmath81 , the k - s equation has the following solution @xmath82 where @xmath83 are arbitrary real numbers .",

    "therefore , different invariant solutions are found from similar subgroups of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , classification of @xmath91invariant solutions is reduced to the problem of classification of subgroups of @xmath85 , up to similarity .",
    "an optimal system of @xmath90dimensional subgroups of @xmath85 is a list of conjugacy inequivalent @xmath90dimensional subgroups of @xmath85 with the property that any other subgroup is conjugate to precisely one subgroup in the list .",

    "thus , the problem of finding an optimal system of subgroups is equivalent to that of finding an optimal system of subalgebras , and so we concentrate on it .",
    "@xmath16 there is clearly an infinite number of one - dimensional subalgebras of the k - s lie algebra , @xmath57 , each of which may be used to construct a special solutions or class of solutions .",

    "in fact , for one - dimensional subalgebras , the classification problem is essentially the same as the problem of classifying the orbits of the adjoint representation .",
    "if we take only one representative from each family of equivalent subalgebras , an optimal set of subalgebras is created .",
