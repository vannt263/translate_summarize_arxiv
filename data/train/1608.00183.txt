    "ultracold atoms exhibit universal properties in the strong coupling regime , where the system can be fully described by a few physical parameters and irrelevant to the short - range details of interaction potentials . in this regime",
    ", any perturbative approach fails to work , while a set of rigorous universal relations can be established to describe various microscopic and thermodynamic properties .",
    "these relations are connected by a key quantity called the _ contact _ , as first derived for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) spin-1/2 fermi gas near the s - wave feshbach resonance@xcite and verified in experiments@xcite . later on the universal relations",
    "were generalized to other atomic systems , such as bosons@xcite , in low - dimension@xcite , with higher partial - wave scatterings@xcite and with multiple scattering channels@xcite . very recently",
    "the contacts and universal properties of a 3d spin - polarized fermi gas have been successfully explored near the p - wave feshbach resonance@xcite .    among all the universal relations ,",
    "the high - momentum distribution @xmath4 describes the microscopic property of the system and can be most easily detected in experiments by the time - of - flight technique . in general , the leading order of @xmath0 in large @xmath5 limit is determined by the scattering channel of the system .",
    "for instance , the s - wave scattering gives rise to the leading @xmath1 tail@xcite while the p - wave gives the @xmath2 tail@xcite , regardless of the dimension of the system .",
    "the sub - leading order , however , can be related to a number of effects , such as the effective range@xcite , the center - of - mass motion@xcite , etc . for instance , it has been found that these effects can contribute to the subheading @xmath6 tail in s - wave@xcite and @xmath1 in p - wave@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the odd powers of @xmath7 have been exclusive in all previous studies , except the @xmath8 tail found to be induced by efimov physics@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the high - momentum distribution and universal relations of the odd - wave interacting fermi gases in one - dimension .",
    "our previous work based on the single - channel contact model has shown the interaction renormalization of this system and the leading high - momentum tail as @xmath9@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend our previous study to further include the finite range effect through a two - channel model .",
    "we show that this treatment allows us to expand @xmath0 as : @xmath10 therefore , to fully characterize the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0 up to @xmath1 , one needs four contacts .",
    "two contacts ( @xmath11 ) are related to the variation of energy with respect to the odd - wave scattering length and the effective range , respectively , determining the @xmath2 tail and part of @xmath1 tail in @xmath0 .",
    "the other two contacts ( @xmath12 ) are related to the center - of - mass motion of the system , respectively determining the @xmath3 tail and the other part of @xmath1 tail .",
    "we point out that the unusual @xmath3 tail , which has not been discovered before in any atomic system , is an intrinsic component to complete the general form of @xmath0 and also is realistically detectable in experiments , for instance , by applying spatially asymmetric trapping potentials .",
    "we derive various universal relations in terms of these contacts , and confirm our results through the solution of a two - body problem .",
    "this work paves the way for studying the strongly odd - wave interacting fermi gases in realistic quasi-1d geometry with finite effective range , and the results obtained also shed light on the general behavior of high - momentum distribution in cold atomic systems as well as the universal properties therein .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we construct the two - channel model for identical fermions and establish the interaction renormalization .",
    "we derive the high - momentum distribution in section iii and various other universal relations in section iv .",
    "these results are confirmed in section v by exactly solving a two - body problem .",
    "the last section vi is contributed to the discussion and summary of our results .",

    "accordingly , one can write down the many - body hamiltonian as : @xmath20 with @xmath21 the length of the system .     and outgoing momenta @xmath22 .",
    "the blue solid circle denotes the atom - dimer coupling vertex .",
    "the horizontal double lines represent the bare dimer propagator @xmath23 , and the bold ones denote the renormalized dimer propagator @xmath24 .",
    ", width=321 ]    given the two - channel model , we first study the effective scattering between two atoms .",
    "fig.1 shows the diagrams for two fermions scattering with total momentum @xmath25 and total energy @xmath26 ( the relative momenta of the incident and outgoing two - fermion are respectively @xmath5 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the t - matrix can be obtained by summing up all relevant diagrams in fig.1 ( see appendix a for more details on feynman rules ) : @xmath28 here @xmath23 is the bare dimer propagator @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is polarization bubble : @xmath31 here the @xmath32 factor in front of above equation is to avoid the double counting of intermediate scattering states of identical fermions . according to eq.[t ] ,",
    "the bold dimer propagator can be obtained via @xmath33 and finally the t - matrix is expressed as : @xmath34 where the odd - wave scattering length @xmath35 and the effective range @xmath36 are related to the bare scattering parameters in the two - channel model : @xmath37 note that we have imposed a momentum cutoff @xmath38 in eqs.([t],[pi ] ) to obtain the expression of @xmath35 in eq.[lo ] . to compare with the interaction renormalization in single - channel model@xcite",
    ", we see that the bare atom - atom coupling @xmath39 there is replaced by @xmath40 in the present two - channel model , while the renormalization term ( @xmath41 ) is the same in both models .",
    "the main advantage of the two - channel framework here is that it naturally produces a finite effective range ( eq.[ro ] ) , to simulate the realistic situation when reducing the 3d p - wave interaction of identical fermions@xcite to the effective 1d odd - wave interaction by applying transverse confinements@xcite .",
    "in this section , we derive the high - momentum distribution for identical fermions based on the two - channel model .",
    "given the established interaction renormalization in last section , we can apply the quantum field method of operator - product - expansion(ope)@xcite , which has been successfully applied to extracting universal relations in various interacting atomic systems@xcite .",
    "we start from the expression of momentum distribution @xmath0 : @xmath42 since the large-@xmath5 behavior of @xmath0 is essentially determined by the one - body density matrix @xmath43 at short distance @xmath44 , we can utilize the ope for expansion : @xmath45 here the local operator @xmath46 can be constructed by quantum fields and their derivatives ; the short - distance coefficient @xmath47 can have non - analytic dependence on @xmath17 , giving the power law tail of @xmath0 according to eq.([rho_k ] ) . in the following",

    "as the ope equation ( [ ope ] ) is an operator equation , @xmath47 can be determined by calculating the expectation value of each operator in ( [ ope ] ) in the simplest two - body state @xmath48 .",
    "this state describes two colliding fermions with momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 and with total energy @xmath51 .     between the two - particle scattering states ( see appendix a for more details on feynman rules ) .",

    "( see appendix a ) , fig.2(a ) simply gives @xmath52 ; fig.2(b ) and ( c ) both give @xmath53 ; fig.3(d ) , which involves an integral over the momenta of internal lines , gives :    @xmath54    with @xmath55 we see that above @xmath56-function include a series of terms that are non - analytical at @xmath44 : @xmath57 as discussed before , these terms will determine the large-@xmath5 behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "next we search for the local operators @xmath46 in the right side of ope ( [ ope ] ) to match the elements of @xmath58 as produced by the diagrams in fig.2(a - d ) .",
    "first , we note that fig.2(a , b , c ) all produce analytical function of @xmath17 , thus one can simply find the local operators by taylor expanding these functions in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "take fig.2(a ) for instance , as @xmath59 , so the local operators are simply the one - body operators @xmath60 , and the coefficients are @xmath61 .",
    "the according diagrams for those local operators are shown in fig.3(a ) .",

    "the diagrams in fig.3(d ) can match all the analytical functions of @xmath17 produced by the diagrams in fig.2(d ) .",
    "however , fig.2(d ) also produce non - analytical terms as in the f - function in eqs.([f],[f_non_analy ] ) , which can not be matched by any diagram in fig.3(a - d ) .",
    "these non - analytical terms must correspond to other @xmath46 other than the one - atom local operators .     and its derivatives , between the two - particle scattering states.,width=226 ]    in order to match the non - analytical terms produced by fig.2(d ) , we have to find the local operator @xmath46 whose expectation value under @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "it turns out to be the dimer local operator @xmath63 or its derivatives , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "these operators and their according matrix elements are : @xmath64 thus we have the following terms in the right side of ope equation ( [ ope ] ) , @xmath65 to match the left side of ( [ ope ] ) . in combination with eq .",
    "[ rho_k ] , we obtain the large momentum distribution as eq.([k_tail ] ) , where the contacts are @xmath66 here @xmath67 denotes the subscript @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "following above procedures , we can further extend the @xmath0 expansion to even higher orders of @xmath7 .",
    "it can be expected that all the odd powers of @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 , in f - function will produce the @xmath72 tail in @xmath0 , while the @xmath73 terms in f - function will produce the @xmath74 tail in @xmath0 .",
    "these odd - power tails as @xmath74 have not be found in the large momentum distribution of atomic systems studied before , except the @xmath8 tail in identical bosons due to a different mechanism of efimov physics@xcite . nevertheless , we show here that these odd - power terms can be caused by particular types of non - analyticity in the one - body density matrix at short distance , thus should all be included to complete the general form of @xmath0 in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "possible detection of these odd power terms in @xmath0 will be discussed later .",

    "@xmath83 , eq.[energy ] reproduces the result obtained within a single - channel model@xcite .",
    "note that in the presence of a trapping potential @xmath84 , an additional term , @xmath85 , should be added to eq.[energy ] .    _",
    "( iii ) virial theorem . _ with a harmonic trapping potential @xmath86 , the virial theorem can be obtained via dimensional analysis@xcite , which requires @xmath87 . using the feynman - hellman theorem together with the adiabatic relations ( [ adia1],[adia2 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath88    _ ( iv ) pressure relation .",
    "_ in a homogeneous system , the pressure relation can be obtained by applying dimensional analysis@xcite to the free energy density @xmath89 , which requires @xmath90 . using the adiabatic relations ( [ adia1],[adia2 ] ) , the pressure density @xmath91",

    "it is useful to check the high - momentum distribution and universal relations through the simple yet insightful two - body problem . for two atoms and a dimer scattering in a homogenous system ,",
    "we can write down an ansatz wave - function : @xmath96 here we have considered a finite total momentum @xmath25 , a conserved quantity in this problem . by imposing the schrodinger equation @xmath97 , we can get two equations in terms of the coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which finally result in a single equation for the binding energy @xmath100 : @xmath101 given the scattering parameters defined in ( [ lo],[ro ] ) , the above equation is equivalent to @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "note that eq.[kappa ] corresponds to the divergence of t - matrix in eq.[t - lp ] with momentum @xmath5 replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "given the energy solution in eq.[kappa ] , the momentum distribution of atoms can be obtained as : @xmath105 in the large @xmath5 limit , we get @xmath106 we see that this asymptotic form fits eq.[k_tail ] well .",

    "similarly , one can verify straightforwardly the other universal relations expressed in eqs.([adia1],[adia2],[energy],[pressure ] ) , by using the binding energy solution in eq.[kappa ] and the contacts in eq.[c_2-body ] .",
    "we have shown in this work that the odd - power terms as @xmath74 in the large momentum distribution @xmath0 can originate from a particular set of non - analyticity in the one - body density matrix at short - distance . as a result , these terms should be included as intrinsic components of @xmath0 .",
    "our results would shed light on the general form of high - momentum distribution in cold atomic systems studied previously and in future .    in practice ,",
    "the @xmath3 tail and the associated contact @xmath81 can be detected in the 1d odd - wave interacting fermions with finite center - of - mass momentum . to prepare such a system",
    ", one may apply an external potential which has no inversion symmetry in spatial space , i.e. , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is an arbitrary length ) , such as an imbalanced double well potential@xcite . in this way , the single - particle distributions at momenta @xmath5 and @xmath111 are not equal and in general @xmath0 would have contributions from @xmath74 terms .",
    "the related contact @xmath81 can be extracted from the leading order of the subtracted momentum distribution @xmath112@xcite .",
    "in contrast , for identical fermions in homogeneous 1d system , it has been found that @xmath0 at resonance only depend on the even powers of @xmath7 due to symmetry requirement@xcite .",
