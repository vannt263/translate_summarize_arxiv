    "the production and weak decay properties of strangeness - rich systems is of fundamental importance for our understanding of relativistic heavy - ion collisions and certain astrophysical phenomena , such as neutron stars .",
    "the simplest systems with strangeness , hypernuclei with one or two bound @xmath1 s , have been used to study both the strong and the weak baryon - baryon ( bb ) interaction in the su(3 ) sector . until now , hypernuclear weak decay represents the only source of information on the @xmath13 four fermion interaction where , in contrast to the weak @xmath14 nn case , both the weak parity - conserving ( pc ) and parity - violating ( pv ) amplitudes can be studied .    in the absence of exact solutions to low - energy qcd ,",
    "effective field - theory techniques based on chiral expansions have been fairly successful in the description of hadronic observables in the ( non - strange ) su(2 ) sector .",
    "the stability of the chiral expansion is less clear for the su(3 ) sector , due to the significant amount of su(3 ) symmetry breaking . a well - known failure of su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory has been the prediction@xcite of the four pc @xmath15-wave amplitudes in the weak nonleptonic decays of octet baryons , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 . since large cancellations among tree - level amplitudes are held responsible for the problem with the weak @xmath15-wave octet amplitudes , it is imperative to assess whether this situation is universal within su(3 ) @xmath7pt or limited to a few exceptional cases .",
    "however , other weak octet baryon - baryon - meson ( bbm ) vertices can only be accessed through reactions that allow for the virtual exchange of mesons , such as the reactions @xmath2 and @xmath20 . the process @xmath2 has been extensively studied in an approach where the long - range part of this interaction is based on the exchange of the su(3 ) pseudoscalar meson octet ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the pseudoscalar baryon - baryon - meson vertices are considered fixed by experiment in the case of the pion , and by su(3 ) chiral algebra for the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 . since the large momentum transfer in the reaction ( typically 400 mev / c ) leads to a mechanism where",
    "short - range effects must be included , they have been modelled either through the exchange of the vector meson octet@xcite ( @xmath24,@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) or quark exchange@xcite .",
    "the vector baryon - baryon - meson vertices are constrained by much weaker su(6 ) considerations .",
    "the @xmath2 process is then embedded in nuclear many - body matrix elements using either correlated faddeev amplitudes in the case of few - body systems , hypernuclear shell model wave functions or nuclear matter solutions within the local density approximation , depending on the mass number of the hypernucleus under investigation . while this description of hypernuclear weak decay is not as rigorous as effective field theory would require , it nevertheless has been reasonably successful in describing the available experimental data .    since the late 1960 s ,",
    "the production and decay of single-@xmath1 hypernuclei has been studied experimentally in great detail , but only very few events involving doubly - strange objects have been reported @xcite .",
    "double @xmath1 hypernuclei are produced via the @xmath27 reaction at kek ( japan ) and bnl ( usa ) , where a @xmath5 hypernuclear fragment can be formed by @xmath28 capture on a nucleus .",
    "the finuda experiment at da@xmath29ne ( frascati , italy ) can produce double-@xmath1 hypernuclei by stopping slow @xmath30 ( coming from the @xmath29 decay ) into thin targets to obtain data with higher energy resolution .",
    "studying the weak decay of those objects opens the door to a number of new exotic @xmath1-induced decay modes : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "both of these decays would involve hyperons in the final state and should be distinguishable from the ordinary @xmath33 mode .",
    "the @xmath31 channel is especially intriguing since the dominant pion exchange is forbidden , thus forcing this reaction to occur mostly through kaon exchange .",
    "one would therefore gain access to the weak @xmath5k and @xmath6k vertices .    in this paper",
    ", we extend previous weak decay calculations of single-@xmath1 hypernuclei into the @xmath34 sector , thus exploring the power of the @xmath35 process to shed light on the novel weak vertices . in order to take into account the effects of the strong interaction between the baryons ,",
    "correlated wave functions are obtained from a @xmath36-matrix calculation for the initial @xmath1n and @xmath5 states , while a @xmath37-matrix equation is solved for the final nn and yn states using the nijmegen interaction models@xcite , in particular the nsc97f one .",
    "in the weak nonmesonic decay of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei , new hyperon - induced mechanisms , the @xmath3 and the @xmath38 transitions ( denoted as @xmath39 throughout the text ) become possible in addition to the dominant @xmath40 decay mode . assuming the initial hypernucleus to be at rest , the nmd rate is given by :    @xmath41    where the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass of the hypernucleus , the energy of the residual -particle system , and the total asymptotic energies of the emitted baryons , respectively . the integration variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the momenta of the two baryons in the final state . in the expression above ,",
    "the momentum - conserving delta function has been used to integrate over the momentum of the residual nucleus .",
    "the sum , together with the factor @xmath48 , indicates an average over the initial hypernucleus spin projections , @xmath49 , and a sum over all quantum numbers of the residual -particle system , @xmath50 , as well as the spin and isospin projections of the emitted particles , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the total nonmesonic decay rate can be written as : @xmath53 where the rate corresponding to @xmath40 transitions @xmath54 is divided into a neutron - induced rate , @xmath55 and a proton - induced one , @xmath56 , while the @xmath1-induced transitions @xmath57 give rise to @xmath1n , @xmath58n and @xmath59p final states , hence : @xmath60    note that while the individual rates have been written above as exclusive observables , in principle , charge - exchange final state interactions ( fsi ) with the residual nucleus obscurs a clean experimental discrimination of these channels on the basis of the charge of the emitted particles .",
    "monte carlo intranuclear cascade models are necessary @xcite to extract the partial weak decay rates of hypernuclei from experiment @xcite . the impossibility of measuring the partial rates directly from the charge of the emitted particles was also shown in the case of the weak decay of the hypertriton @xcite , a system where the strong interaction effects can be treated exactly using fadeev equations with a realistic baryon - baryon potential .    in order to draw conclusions regarding the weak dynamics , one has to write the hypernuclear transition amplitude , @xmath61 , in terms of the elementary two - body transitions , @xmath62 , and nuclear structure details have to be treated with as few approximations and ambiguities as possible .",
    "we work in a shell - model framework , hence the @xmath1 hyperons and the nucleons are described by single - particle orbitals . in addition , we assume a weak coupling scheme by virtue of which the @xmath1 hyperons couple only to the ground state of the nuclear core . therefore , in the case of the @xmath12he hypernucleus studied here , with quantum numbers , , the state will be given by @xmath63 where antisymmetry forces the two @xmath1 hyperons to be in a @xmath64 state , since they are assumed to be in the lowest s - shell before the decay occurs .",
    "this is so because , in general , hypernuclei with @xmath1 s in excited orbitals will rapidly decay into the ground state through electromagnetic or strong de - excitation processes , which are orders of magnitude faster than those mediated by the weak interaction .",

    "most of the @xmath169 rate comes from the exchange of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons .",
    "note that the small @xmath164 ratio for the one - pion exchange mechanism substantially increases when the @xmath22-meson is incorporated due to a destructive ( constructive ) interference in the @xmath170-induced ( @xmath171-induced ) rate .",

    "we obtain instead a significantly larger value of @xmath175 .",
    "this finding can be traced to the @xmath1 which is more strongly bound in @xmath12he than it is in @xmath173he by about 80% ( i.e. , the @xmath1 single - particle separation energy changes from 3.12 mev to around 5 mev ) .",
    "this increased binding is reflected in the @xmath1 single - particle wave function , with a harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath66 fm instead of the value @xmath176 fm used in the decay of single-@xmath1 hypernuclei @xcite . as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , the parameter @xmath66 fm simulates the uncorrelated @xmath5 probability of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reproduces the binding energy of the three observed double-@xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "there is also some influence from the slightly different kinematics involved in the @xmath169 decay of @xmath177he with respect to that in @xmath178he .    from the results presented in table [ tab : res.nsc97f ] , we observe that the @xmath167 rate receives a tiny contribution from the isovector @xmath21 and @xmath24 mesons .",
    "this is due to the combined transition @xmath179 , which is possible through the coupling between @xmath1n and @xmath18n states induced by the strong interaction .",
    "analogously , the strong @xmath180n coupling also induces very small contributions from the isoscalar mesons to the @xmath18n rate , @xmath181 .",
    "we find the rate @xmath182 to be dominated by @xmath22-exchange .",
    "we note that the @xmath183 contribution is very similar to the value for @xmath22-exchange alone ; adding the @xmath23 meson decreases the rate by 35% . however , there is strong evidence that we are overestimating the role of the @xmath23 meson by using strong @xmath23nn and @xmath184 couplings that rely on su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "all indications from a careful analysis of reactions like @xmath23 photoproduction@xcite point towards a @xmath23nn coupling much smaller than the one provided by su(3 ) symmetry . in this case , the weak decay of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei going to final @xmath1n states would be almost solely determined by @xmath22 exchange and the measurement of this decay channel would provide valuable information on the weak @xmath149k couplings . in particular , since this partial rate is dominated by pc transitions , as can be inferred from the values of the @xmath185 weak couplings listed in table [ tab : wcc ] , one would gain access to the pc @xmath185 amplitude .",
    "the rate to final @xmath18n states , @xmath181 , on the other hand is very small and , as expected , dominated by the @xmath21-exchange mechanism .",
    "the ratios between the rates that include correlations are : @xmath186 correlations have a stronger influence on the yn channels , which are a factor @xmath187 smaller compared to the nn rate , even though the @xmath18n transition allows a final state with a lower relative momentum and , therefore , is less sensitive to the strongly repulsive core of the yn interaction . however , the nn rate is dominated by tensor transitions that are absent in the yn channels because the interacting @xmath149 pair is in a @xmath64 state . with the tensor strength distributed towards larger distances compared to those for central and parity - violating transitions ,",
    "the nn transition becomes comparatively less affected by strong correlations than the yn ones .",
    "note that correlations tend to increase the @xmath1n rate while decreasing the @xmath18n rate .",
    "the reason is that the uncorrelated @xmath18n rate is dominated by @xmath21 and @xmath26 exchanges , the @xmath26 contribution being about twice that of the @xmath21 meson , whereas the @xmath1n rate comes mainly from strange meson exchange , with the @xmath22 contribution twice as large as that of the @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the supression of short - range physics induced by correlations affects the @xmath18n rate more than the @xmath1n one .",
    "in addition , it is known@xcite that the @xmath18n interaction for the new nijmegen potentials is quite repulsive in the @xmath188 channel , affecting the @xmath18n wave functions significantly , which are pushed out from the weak potential interaction range .",

    "once all the mesons are included , the nn rate obtained with the one - loop corrected nnk couplings is a factor 1.4 larger than that obtained with the tree - level values , while the ratio @xmath164 is smaller by a factor of two .",
    "although the one - loop corrected @xmath5k couplings of table [ chpt ] are not much different from the corresponding tree - level values , they lead to a reduction of the @xmath22-meson exchange contribution to the @xmath1n rate by about a factor two .",
    "hence , the contribution of the @xmath23 meson and the vector mesons becomes more relevant , making the extraction of the @xmath149k coupling from this @xmath203 decay mode more difficult .",
    "the decay rate into final @xmath18n states is the only one that increases when the one - loop corrected @xmath6k couplings are used , despite the magnitude of the @xmath15-wave amplitudes being ten times smaller than the corresponding tree - level values , whereas the @xmath198-wave amplitudes are only moderately larger .",
    "in fact , table [ tab : res.nsc97f ] reveals that the @xmath22-exchange contribution to the @xmath18n rate is two times smaller than that obtained with the tree - level @xmath6k couplings , as expected from the reduced magnitude of the couplings .",
    "however , due to the opposite sign of the loop - corrected @xmath15-wave coupling with respect to the corresponding tree level value , the interference between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 contributions is now constructive instead of destructive , which explains the final increased loop - corrected rate .    finally , we have investigated how our results would change if we allowed the one - loop corrected bbk couplings to vary within their estimated error bands .",

    "the results summarized in table [ tab : summarize ] show clearly that the inclusion of weak bbk couplings obtained with one - loop corrections to the leading order in @xmath7pt produces a @xmath40 rate 40 % larger than the tree - level value , a ratio @xmath164 twice smaller , a @xmath31 rate roughly twice smaller , and a @xmath38 rate almost twice as large .",
    "in this study we investigated the nonmesonic weak decay modes of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei within a one - meson - exchange framework .",
    "our results are given for the specific double-@xmath1 hypernucleus @xmath12he , but can easily be extended to heavier systems .",
    "the standard nucleon - induced nonmesonic @xmath40 rate is found to be more than twice as large as in @xmath178he due to the increased binding of the second @xmath1 hyperon .",
    "two new hyperon - induced modes become possible , @xmath167 and @xmath204 , the latter coming in two charge states .",
    "we find the total hyperon - induced rate to be as large as 4% of the total nonmesonic rate .",
    "this new rate is dominated by the @xmath167 mode .",
    "in fact , this transition turns out to be the more interesting one ( rather than the @xmath204 ) since it allows direct access to exotic vertices like @xmath5k , unencumbered by the usually dominant pion exchange .",
    "indeed , one - loop log corrected @xmath7pt results modify the @xmath205 by 50% while changing the @xmath40 only at the 15% level , demonstrating the power of this weak mechanism to test @xmath7pt in the weak su(3 ) sector . with a free @xmath1 in the final state",
    "this new mode should be distinguishable from the usual nucleon - induced decay channels .",
    "given the potential benefits to hadronic physics , the experimental program of investigating the production and decay of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei should be intensified .",
