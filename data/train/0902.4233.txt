    "an important and geometrically significant class of dynamical systems consists of billiards with ellipsoidal boundary in @xmath0 . by chasles",

    "existence of caustics is , in fact , a geometrical manifestation of integrals of motion . due to them",
    ", we easily see that elliptical billiard is an completely integrable hamiltonian system .",

    "geodesic flow on ellipsoid also gives rise to another interesting class of billiard systems : billiards on the ellipsoid , where the boundary is determined by the intersection of the ellipsoid with a confocal quadric .",
    "trajectories of such a billiard are composed of geodesic segments .",
    "billiard systems within and geodesic flows on ellipsoids have been extensively studied from xixth century on : see classical works @xcite and more recent ones @xcite with the references therein . from the non - vanishing interest , one may notice that this topic is far from being exhausted .",

    "the detailed description of this kind of topological classification of integrable systems can be found in @xcite and references therein , while a very concise summary for a reader not acquainted with it is given in the appendix of this paper .",
    "although plane elliptical billiards are quite well known , we may see that such a description will give a new and exciting insight into its properties  note , for example , appearance of a non - orientable periodic trajectory along one of the axes of the billiard boundary in proposition [ prop : ellipse.hyp ] , see figure [ fig : bilijar3 ] .    in the book @xcite",
    ", one may find a large list of fomenko graphs for known integrable systems , such as integrable cases of rigid body motion and integrable geodesic flows on surfaces .",

    "some other examples , connected with near - integrable dynamics can be found in @xcite while bifurcations of liouville foliations in a certain class of integrable systems with two degrees of freedom , were classified using fomenko graphs in @xcite .",
    "let us note that topological properties of elliptical billiards , viewed as discrete dynamical systems , have been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we consider billiards as continuous systems , which enables us to use tools developed by fomenko and his school .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : isoenergy ] , we begin with introductory remarks on isoenergy surfaces of billiard systems .",
    "section [ sec : ravan ] contains topological description of several examples of plane billiards , with the boundary composed of confocal conics , together with their representation via fomenko graphs . in section [ sec : na.elipsoidu ] , topological description of the billiard flow with the quadratic boundary on the ellipsoid in @xmath5 is given .",
    "we conclude this section by demonstrating the liouville equivalence of the billiard motion within an ellipsoid on any liouville surface . in section [ sec : vise.dimenzija ] , the topological structure of the billiard inside ellipsoid in @xmath5 is described .",
    "the appendix contains a summary on fomenko graphs .",
    "let @xmath6 be an @xmath7-dimensional riemann manifold , and @xmath8 a domain with the boundary composed of several smooth hypersurfaces . the billiard @xcite inside @xmath9 is a dynamical system where a material point of the unit mass is freely moving inside the domain and obeying the reflection law at the boundary , i.e.  having congruent impact and reflection angles with the space tangent to the boundary at any bouncing point .",
    "it is also assumed that the reflection is absolutely elastic , i.e.that the speed of the material point does not change before and after impacts .",
    "it is important to remark that the change of the total energy of the system , only the intensity of the velocity vector of the point will be changed while the trajectories will be the same at each energy level .",
    "that is why , for the complete analysis of the billiard system , we may fix the speed and investigate only one energy level .    the isoenergy space for the billiard system inside @xmath9",
    "is : @xmath10    although the smoothness of motion of the billiard particle is violated at the boundary , let us note that , unexpectedly , the isoenergy space will be smooth , assuming that the billiard boundary is smooth . even more , this manifold is smooth also when boundary is only composed of a few smooth parts , if the billiard reflection can be continuously defined at the angle points",
    ". this will be always the case in our examples , when the boundary is placed on a few confocal conics , since they are orthogonal to each other .",
    "thus , the reflection at the intersection points is defined as follows : the velocity vector @xmath11 after the reflection at the non - smooth point of the boundary , changes to @xmath12 .",
    "an important example of integrable billiard system is the billiard within an ellipse in @xmath13 .",
    "the integrability of such a billiard motion is due to the nice and elementary fact : each segment of a trajectory is tangent to the same conic confocal with the boundary @xcite .",
    "moreover , the boundary of any integrable billiard in a plane domain is composed of segments of several confocal conics @xcite .    in this section",

    "as in introduction , we denote its isoenergy manifold by @xmath16 .",
    "[ prop : bilijar1 ] the isoenergy manifold corresponding to the billiard system within an ellipse in @xmath13 is represented by the fomenko graph on figure [ fig : fom1 ] .",

    "the isoenergy manifold @xmath16 is the solid torus with the identification on @xmath22 on the boundary .",
    "this identification glues pairs of points , while points contained on two curves  representing flows in positive and negative directions along the boundary of the billiard table , are not glued with any other .",
    "the torus with the two curves on the boundary is shown on figure [ fig : torus1 ] .",
    "these two curves correspond to the limit flow with the caustic @xmath23 , and they are represented with the lower @xmath18-atoms on the graph . for the parameter @xmath24 , i.e. when the caustic is an ellipse , we have two liouville tori over each value of @xmath25 ",
    "one for each direction of rotation .",
    "let us describe the level set @xmath26 .",
    "this level set contains exactly those billiard trajectories that pass through foci of the ellipse . among them , there is one periodic trajectory  the motion along @xmath27-axis , while others have the well - known property that their segments alternately pass through left and right focus of the ellipse .",
    "these trajectories can be naturally divided into @xmath19 classes  one is composed of the trajectories where the particle is moving upward through the left focus and downward through the right one , and the second contains the trajectories with the reverse property .",
    "note these two classes by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "all their trajectories are homoclinically tending to the @xmath27-axis , thus @xmath30 and @xmath29 are separatrices .",

    "counterclockwise ) direction .    when @xmath31 , i.e.  when the caustic is a hyperbola , there is only one torus for each value . finally , to the @xmath32 , the periodic motion along @xmath33-axis takes place , and it is represented by the upper @xmath18-atom .    in the similar way",
    ", we can obtain the following :    [ prop : ell.ell ] the isoenergy manifold corresponding to the billiard system in the domain limited with two confocal ellipses in @xmath13 is represented by the fomenko graph on figure [ fig : fom2 ] .",
    "as in proposition [ prop : bilijar1 ] , the lower @xmath18-atoms correspond to the limit flows on the boundary of the outer ellipse .",
    "the level set for the caustic @xmath26 contains two periodic trajectories placed on the @xmath27-axis and all trajectories such that the continuations of their segments contain the foci .",
    "let us note that such a trajectory is heteroclinic and placed only in one of the half - planes with the @xmath27-axis as the edge .",
    "thus , this level set has four separatrices : two in the upper half - plane , two in the lower one . in each half - plane , one separatrix contains trajectories tending to the left periodic trajectory on the @xmath27-axis when time tends to @xmath17 and to the right one in @xmath34 , and opposite for orbits on the other separatrix .",
    "liouville tori corresponding to elliptic caustics tend when @xmath25 tends to @xmath35 , to two separatrices with the same movement direction  clockwise or counterclockwise .    for hyperbolic caustics , the billiard table become split into two domains , symmetric with respect to the @xmath27-axis .",

    "since confocal conics are always orthogonal in the intersection points , the periodic flows along smooth arcs may appear as limits of the billiard motion , when the caustic tend to the conic containing the arc .",
    "thus , although the tangent space to the boundary in the intersection points is not defined , we will take that the `` allowed '' velocity vectors in such points are those tangent to the curves containing these points , with the opposite vectors identified with each other .",
