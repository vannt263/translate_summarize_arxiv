    "recently , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiment  @xcite has released an improved measurement with enhanced neutral current sensitivity due to neutron capture on salt , which has been added to the heavy water in the sno detector .",
    "this adds precious information to the large amount of data on neutrino oscillations published in the last few years .",
    "thanks to this growing body of data a rather clear picture of the neutrino sector is starting to emerge .",
    "in particular , the results of the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite have played an important role in confirming that the disappearance of solar electron neutrinos  @xcite , the long  standing solar neutrino problem , is mainly due to oscillations and not to other types of neutrino conversions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , kamland has pinned down that the oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem is the large mixing angle msw solution ( lma  msw )  @xcite characterized by the presence of matter effects  @xcite . on the other hand , experiments with atmospheric neutrinos",
    "@xcite show strong evidence in favour of @xmath2 oscillations , in agreement with the first data from the k2k accelerator experiment  @xcite .",
    "together with the non  observation of oscillations in reactor experiments at a baseline of about 1  km  @xcite , and the strong rejection against transitions involving sterile states  @xcite , these positive evidences can be very naturally accounted for within a three - neutrino framework .",
    "the large and nearly maximal mixing angles indicated by the solar and atmospheric neutrino data samples , respectively , come as a surprise for particle physics , as it contrasts with the small angles characterizing the quark sector .    in this work we report on the implications of the new sno  salt measurement on the determination of three  neutrino oscillation parameters . in sec .",
