    "a weak perturbation of a hamiltonian system causes the onset of chaotic layers around separatrices of the unperturbed system and/or separatrices surrounding nonlinear resonances generated by the perturbation @xcite .",
    "the system may be transported along the layer in a random - like fashion and this chaotic transport plays an important role in many physical phenomena @xcite . if the perturbation is sufficiently weak , then the layers are thin and the chaos is called _ local _ @xcite",
    ". as the perturbation magnitude increases , the width of the layer grows and the layers corresponding to adjacent separatrices reconnect at some , typically non - small , critical value of the perturbation .",
    "this conventionally marks the onset of _ global _ chaos @xcite i.e. chaos in a large region of the phase space , with chaotic transport throughout the whole relevant energy range .",
    "the reconnection of the layers around separatrices of the resonances often correlates with the overlap in energy between neighbouring resonances calculated independently in the resonant approximation .",
    "the latter constitutes the heuristic chirikov resonance - overlap criterion @xcite .",
    "but the chirikov criterion may fail if the system is of the _ zero - dispersion _ ( zd )",
    "type @xcite i.e. if the frequency of eigenoscillations possesses a local maximum or minimum as a function of its energy ( cf . also studies of related maps @xcite which are called _ nontwist _ , _ twistless _ or _ nonmonotonic twist _ maps ) . in such systems , there are typically two resonances of one and the same order @xcite , and their overlap in energy does not result in the onset of global chaos @xcite . even their overlap in phase space @xcite results typically only in the reconnection of the thin chaotic layers associated with the resonances .",

    "an example of the evolution of resonances in the plane of energy and slow angle is given in fig .",
    "1 ( the typical evolution of a real poincar section is shown e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "as it is known @xcite , any hamiltonian system with two or more separatrices belongs to the zd type : the eigenfrequency as a function of energy possesses a local maximum between each pair of adjacent separatrices . for the purpose of global chaos onset",
    ", our letter @xcite has addressed the possibility to combine the overlap of resonances with each other ( typical of zd systems ) and their overlap with the chaotic layers associated with the separatrices . via numerical simulations , @xcite demonstrated that this is possible , leading to a scenario for global chaos onset which requires much smaller perturbation amplitudes than in the conventional case .",
    "the letter @xcite suggested also a heuristic theory for this effect ( more details were presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the _ present _ work develops the method for the quantitative description of chaotic layers in _ phase space _",
    ", for the resonance frequency range .",
    "we uncover the physical mechanism of their overlap with the resonances , and on this basis develop a detailed _ self - contained _ theory of the facilitated onset of global chaos .",
    "we also discuss generalizations and applications .",
    "the method for the description of the chaotic layers is of _ general importance _ : in conventional systems with a single - separatrix layer , it predicts a much larger maximum width in energy than what was assumed before @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . sec .",

    "as an example of a one - dimensional hamiltonian system possessing two or more separatrices , we use a spatially periodic potential system with two different - height barriers per period ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) :    @xmath1    this model may relate e.g. to a pendulum spinning about its vertical axis @xcite or to a classical 2d electron gas in a magnetic field spatially periodic in one of the in - plane dimensions @xcite .",
    "the interest to the latter system arose in the 90th due to technological advances allowing to manufacture magnetic superlattices of high - quality @xcite leading to a variety of interesting behaviours of the charge carriers in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) show respectively the separatrices of the hamiltonian system ( 1 ) in the @xmath2 plane and the dependence of the frequency @xmath3 of its oscillation , often called _ eigenfrequency _ , on its energy @xmath4 .",
    "the separatrices correspond to energies equal to the value of the potential barrier tops @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "the function @xmath7 is close to the extreme eigenfrequency @xmath8 for most of the range @xmath9 $ ] while sharply decreasing to zero as @xmath10 approaches either @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "0.2 cm 0.2 cm 0.2 cm    add now a time - periodic perturbation : as an example , we use an ac drive , which corresponds to a dipole @xcite perturbation of the hamiltonian : @xmath13    the _ conventional _ scenario of global chaos onset between the separatrices of the system ( 2)-(1 ) is illustrated by fig .  3 .",
    "the figure presents the evolution of the stroboscopic poincar section as @xmath14 grows while @xmath15 is fixed at an arbitrarily chosen value _ away _ from @xmath16 and its harmonics . at small @xmath14 , there are two thin chaotic layers around the inner and outer separatrices of the unperturbed system .",
    "unbounded chaotic transport takes place only in the outer chaotic layer i.e.  in a _ narrow _ energy range .",
    "as @xmath14 grows , so do also the layers . at some critical value @xmath17 , the layers merge .",
    "this may be considered as the onset of global chaos : the whole range of energies between the barrier levels is involved , with unbounded chaotic transport .",
    "the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is any integer ) in the poincar section are associated respectively with the inner and outer saddles of the unperturbed system , and necessarily belong to the inner and outer chaotic layers , respectively .",
    "thus , the necessary and sufficient condition for global chaos onset may be formulated as the possibility for the system placed initially in the state @xmath21 to pass beyond the neighbouring of the outer ",
    "states , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , i.e. the coordinate @xmath24 becomes @xmath25 or @xmath26 at sufficiently large times @xmath27 .    a diagram in the @xmath28 plane , based on the above criterion , is shown in fig .",
    "the lower boundary of the shaded area represents the function @xmath29 .",
    "it has deep _ spikes _ i.e. cusp - like local minima .",
    "the most pronounced spikes are situated at frequencies @xmath30 that are slightly less than the odd multiples of @xmath16 ,    @xmath31    the deepest minimum occurs at @xmath32 : the value of @xmath33 in the minimum , @xmath34 , is approximately 40 times smaller than the value in the neighbouring pronounced local maximum of @xmath29 at @xmath35 . as @xmath36 increases",
    ", the @xmath36th minimum becomes less deep .",
    "the function @xmath29 is very sensitive to @xmath15 in the vicinity of the minima : for example , a shift of @xmath15 down from @xmath37 by only 1% causes an increase of @xmath33 by @xmath38 .",
    "the origin of the spikes becomes more clear looking at the evolution of the poincar section for @xmath39 as @xmath14 grows ( fig .",
    "5 ) : it drastically differs from the conventional evolution shown in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath40 ( fig .  5(a ) ) , one can see four chaotic trajectories .",
    "two of them are associated with the inner and outer separatrices of the unperturbed system , similarly to the conventional case ( cf .",
    "they are marked by green and blue respectively .",
    "these trajectories fill the corresponding chaotic layers , which will be referred below as the inner `` and outer '' separatrix layers respectively .",
    "the other two chaotic trajectories marked by red and cyan are associated with the two nonlinear resonances of the 1st order .",
    "examples of non - chaotic trajectories separating the chaotic ones are shown in brown .",
    "as the perturbation amplitude @xmath14 increases , the outer separatrix layer sequentially absorbs other chaotic trajectories while large stability islands ( associated with the resonances ) arise in the layer . at @xmath41 ,",
    "it has absorbed the red trajectory : the resulting chaotic layer is shown in blue in fig .",
    "5(b ) . at @xmath42 ,",
    "this chaotic layer has absorbed the cyan chaotic trajectory : the resulting chaotic layer is shown in blue in fig .",
    "5(c ) @xcite .",
    "finally , at @xmath43 the latter blue layer has merged with the inner separatrix layer @xcite ( see fig .",
    "5(d ) ) , i.e. the onset of global chaos as defined above has occurred .    even prior to the theoretical analysis",
    ", one can draw a few conclusions from the evolution .",
    "namely , if @xmath15 is close to the minimum of the spike of @xmath29 , then    * the onset of global chaos occurs due to the _ combination _ of the overlap of chaotic layers associated with nonlinear resonances with each other and the overlap of the latter layers with the inner and outer separatrix layers ; * the width of the nonlinear resonances are large already at quite _ small _ amplitudes of the perturbation , so that the overlap with the chaotic layers around the original separatrices occurs at unusually small perturbation amplitudes ; * the onset of the overlap of at least one of the nonlinear resonances with the outer separatrix layer occurs at values of @xmath14 which are a few times smaller than those required for the onset of the overlap with the inner separatrix layer .",
    "the above conclusions are also illustrated by fig .",
    "6 which presents the evolution of the phase space of slow variables @xcite , action @xmath44 and slow angle @xmath45 , calculated in resonance approximation for the 1st - order spike ( see eq . ( 4 ) below ) .    similarly , for the spikes of higher order , higher - order resonances are relevant",
    "the eigenfrequency @xmath7 is close to its local maximum @xmath16 for most of the relevant range @xmath9 $ ] ( fig .",
    "as shown below , @xmath7 approaches a _ rectangular _ form in the asymptotic limit @xmath46 .",
    "hence , if the perturbation frequency @xmath47 is close to @xmath16 or its odd multiples , @xmath48 , then the energy width of nonlinear resonances becomes comparable to the width of the whole range between barriers ( i.e. @xmath49 ) at a rather small perturbation magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath51 determines the characteristic magnitude of the perturbation required for the conventional overlap of the separatrix chaotic layers , when @xmath15 is not close to any odd multiple of @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "3 ( c ) ) . thus ,",
    "if @xmath53 , the nonlinear resonances should play a crucial role in the onset of global chaos ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) .",
    "we note that it is not entirely obvious _ a priori _ whether it is indeed possible to calculate @xmath54 within the resonance approximation : in fact , it is essential for the separatrices of nonlinear resonances to nearly touch the barriers levels , but the resonance approximation is obviously invalid in the close vicinity of the barriers ; furthermore , numerical calculations of resonances show that , if @xmath55 , the perturbation amplitude @xmath14 at which the resonance separatrix touches a given energy level in the close vicinity of the barriers is very sensitive to @xmath15 , apparently making the calculation of @xmath56 within the resonance approximation even less feasible .",
    "nevertheless , we show below in a self - consistent manner that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath57 , the relevant boundaries of the chaotic layers lie in the range of energies @xmath10 where @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the resonant approximation is valid and it allows to obtain _ explicit _ asymptotic expressions both for @xmath59 and @xmath56 , and for the wings of the spikes in the vicinities of @xmath60 .",
    "the _ asymptotic _",
    "limit @xmath57 is the most interesting one from a theoretical point of view since this limit leads to the strongest facilitation of the global chaos onset and it is most accurately described by the self - contained theory .",
    "most of the theory presented below assumes this limit and concentrates therefore on the results to the _ lowest _ order in the small parameter . on the applications side ,",
    "the range of _ moderately small _",
    "@xmath61 is more interesting , since the chaos facilitation is still pronounced ( and still described by the asymptotic theory ) while the area of chaos between the separatrices is not too small ( comparable with the area inside the inner separatrix ) : cf .",
    "figs . 2 , 3 and 5 . to increase the accuracy of the theoretical description in this range",
    ", we estimate the next - order corrections and develop an efficient numerical procedure allowing for the further corrections .",
    "let @xmath15 be close to the @xmath36th odd @xcite harmonic of @xmath16 , @xmath62 .",
    "over most of the range @xmath9 $ ] , except in the close vicinities of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the @xmath36th harmonic of eigenoscillation is nearly resonant with the perturbation . due to this ,",
    "the ( slow ) dynamics of the action @xmath63 and the angle @xmath64 @xcite can be shown to be described by the following auxiliary hamiltonian ( cf .",

    "this is possible due to the characteristic dependence of the frequency of eigenoscillation on energy in the vicinity of any separatrix : the frequency keeps nearly a _ constant _ value even if the deviation of the energy from the separatrix _ strongly varies _ within a given scale of the deviation .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the latter idea was not exploited before , which is why probably it was thought to be impossible to analyze the dynamics of the separatrix map in an explicit form .",
    "there were various estimates of the layer width in energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) but the quantitative analysis of the layer boundaries in the _ phase space _ was never done in the non - adiabatic case .",
    "in contrast , our approach does analyze the dynamics of the separatrix map , and this allows us in particular to quantitatively describe the layer boundaries in case when the perturbation is resonant with the eigenoscillation in the relevant range of energy .",

    "@xcite where the maximal width is assumed to be @xmath291 ) .",
    "thus , we can quantitatively describe large _ jumps _ and _ peaks _ of the layer width as a function of the perturbation amplitude and frequency respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , a rough estimate on the basis of our approach indicates that , for many classes of systems , the relative range of such jumps / peaks ( i.e. the ratio between the upper and lower levels of the jump / peak ) _ diverges _ in the asymptotic limit @xmath292 .",
    "2 .   apart from the description of the boundaries , the approach allows us to describe the _",
    "chaotic transport _ within the layer .",
    "in particular , it may allow us to calculate a positive lyapunov exponent and to describe diffusion .",
    "our approach may be generalized for a _ non - resonant _ perturbation .",
    "the resonance approximation is not valid then but there still remains the property of a nearly constancy of the frequency of eigenoscillation within an arbitrary given scale of the deviation of energy from the separatrix .",
    "this property may allow us to explicitly describe the dynamics of the separatrix map for any frequency of perturbation which is less than or of the order of the resonance frequency .",

    ", our approach may be useful in the treatment of other chaotic systems and separatrix maps ( see @xcite for the most recent major review on various types of separatrix maps and related continuous chaotic systems ) .",
    "as concerns the _ facilitation of the global chaos onset _ between adjacent separatrices , we mention the following generalizations :    * 1 .",
    "* the spikes in @xmath0 may occur for an _ arbitrary hamiltonian _ system with two or more separatrices .",
    "the asymptotic theory can be generalized accordingly .",
    "the absence of pronounced spikes at _ even _ harmonics @xmath293 is explained by the symmetry of the potential ( 1 ) : the even fourier harmonics of the coordinate , @xmath294 , are equal to zero . for time - periodic perturbation of dipole type , like in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , there are no resonances of even order due to this symmetry @xcite . if either the potential is _ non - symmetric _ or the additive perturbation of the hamiltonian is not an _ odd _ function of the coordinate , then even - order resonances do exist , resulting in the presence of the spikes in @xmath0 at @xmath295 .    * 3 .",
    "* there may be an additional facilitation of global chaos onset which is reasonable to call a secondary  facilitation .",
    "let the frequency @xmath15 be close to the frequency @xmath233 of the spike minimum while the amplitude @xmath14 be @xmath296 but still lower than @xmath0 .",
    "then there are two resonance separatrices in the @xmath138 plane which are not connected by the chaotic transport ( cf . fig .",
    "6(b ) and 5(b ) ) .",
    "this system possesses the zero - dispersion property .",
    "the trajectories of the resonant hamiltonian ( 4 ) which start in between the separatrices oscillate in @xmath113 ( as well as in @xmath297 ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath298 of such oscillations along a given trajectory depends on the corresponding value of @xmath153 analogously to as @xmath3 depends on @xmath10 for the original hamiltonian @xmath74 : @xmath299 is equal to zero for the values of @xmath153 corresponding to the separatrices ( being equal in turn to @xmath300 and @xmath301 : see eq .",
    "( 19 ) ) while possessing a nearly rectangular shape in between , provided the quantity @xmath302 is much smaller than the variation of @xmath153 within each of the resonances ,    @xmath303 and @xmath304 are the values of @xmath153 in the elliptic point of the lower and upper resonance respectively .",
    "the maximum of @xmath299 in between @xmath300 and @xmath301 is asymptotically described by the following formula :    @xmath305    if we additionally perturb the system in such a way that an additional time - periodic term of the frequency @xmath306 arises in the resonance hamiltonian , then the chaotic layers associated with the resonance separatrices may be connected by chaotic transport even for a rather small amplitude of the additional perturbation , due to a scenario similar to the one described in this paper",
    ".    there may be various types of such additional perturbation @xcite .",
    "for example , one may _ add _ to @xmath307 ( 2 ) one more dipole time - periodic perturbation of _ mixed _ frequency ( i.e. @xmath308 ) .",
    "alternatively , one may directly perturb the _ angle _ of the original perturbation by a _ low - frequency _ perturbation , i.e. the time - periodic term in @xmath307 ( 2 ) is replaced by the term    @xmath309    recent physical problems where a similar situation is relevant are : chaotic mixing and transport in a meandering jet flow @xcite and reflection of light rays in a corrugated waveguide @xcite .",
    "if the time - periodic perturbation is _ multiplicative _ rather than additive , the resonances become _ parametric _ ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "parametric resonance is more complicated and much less studied than nonlinear resonance .",
    "nevertheless , the main mechanism for the onset of global chaos remains the same , namely the combination of the reconnection between resonances of the same order and of their overlap in energy with the chaotic layers associated with the barriers . at the same time , the frequencies of the main spikes in @xmath0 may change ( though still being related to @xmath16 ) .",
    "we consider below the example when the periodically driven parameter is the parameter @xmath61 in ( 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian reads as    @xmath310    the term @xmath311 in @xmath307 ( 71 ) may be rewritten as @xmath312 .",
    "the last term in the latter expression does not affect the equations of motion .",
    "thus , we end up with an additive perturbation @xmath313 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath314 , the @xmath36th - order fourier component of the function @xmath315",
    "can be shown to differ from zero only for the orders @xmath316 therefore one may expect the main spikes in @xmath0 to be at frequencies twice larger than those for the dipole perturbation ( 2 ) :    @xmath317    this well agrees with the results of simulations ( fig .",
    "13 ) .    moreover , the asymptotic theory for the dipole perturbation may be immediately generalized to the present case : it is necessary only to replace the fourier component of the coordinate @xmath24 by the fourier component of the function @xmath315 :    @xmath318    ( cf .",
    "( 12 ) for @xmath101 ) .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath319    where @xmath237 is given in eqs . ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) .    for @xmath320 ,",
    "( 74 ) gives , for the 1st spike , values differing from the simulation data by about @xmath321 for the frequency and by about @xmath322 for the amplitude .",
    "thus , the lowest - order formulas accurately describe the 1st spike even for a moderately small @xmath61 .",
    "one more generalization relates to _ multi - dimensional _ hamiltonian systems with two or more saddles with different energies : the perturbation may not necessarily be time - periodic , in this case . the detailed analysis will be done elsewhere .    finally , we point out some analogy between the facilitation of global chaos onset described in our work and the so called stochastic percolation in 2d hamiltonian systems described in @xcite : the merging of internal and external chaotic zones is also relevant there , like in our case . however , both the models and the underlying mechanisms are very different .",
    "namely , the problem studied in @xcite is not of the zero - dispersion type ; and the two - dimensionality is inherently important .",
    "let us turn now to a few detailed examples of applications of the facilitation of global chaos onset .",
    "the first application relates to a classical electron gas in a magnetic superlattice @xcite , where the electrons may be considered as non - interacting quasi - particles moving on a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field spatially periodic in one of the in - plane directions ( we denote it as @xmath323-direction ) .",
    "then the electron motion in the x - direction is described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in which @xmath24 and @xmath324 are the scaled electron coordinate @xmath323 and generalized momentum @xmath325 respectively , while the parameter @xmath61 is proportional to the reciprocal amplitude of the external magnetic field , @xmath326 , and to the generalized momentum @xmath327 in the second ( perpendicular to @xmath323 ) in - plane direction : see for details @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath327 remains constant during the motion @xcite .",
    "if an ac electric field is applied in the @xmath323-direction , then the model ( 2)-(1 ) becomes relevant .",
    "the _ dc - conductivity _ in the @xmath323-direction is proportional to the fraction of electrons that can take part to the unbounded motion in the @xmath323-direction .",
    "this fraction , in turn , significantly grows as the range of energies involved in the unbounded chaotic transport increases @xcite .",
    "if electrons move in vacuum @xcite , then it may be possible to inject a beam of electrons which possess the same velocity . in this case",
    ", the parameter @xmath61 in the model ( 1 ) has some certain value , so that the results obtained in the previous sections are directly applicable .",
    "the spikes in @xmath0 mean a drastic increase of the dc - conductivity occurring at a very weak amplitude of the ac electric field .",
    "the frequency of the ac field should be close to one of the spike frequencies .",
    "the effect is especially pronounced for the 1st spike i.e. when @xmath328 $ ] .",
    "if the electron motion takes place in a semiconductor @xcite , then the velocity in the @xmath329-direction is necessarily _ statistically distributed_. the same concerns the parameter @xmath61 then .",
    "this might seem to smear the effect : cf .",
    "@xcite where the _ conventional _ scenario of the onset of global chaos was exploited",
    ". however , in the case of the zero - dispersion  scenario suggested in our paper , it typically should not be so .",
    "indeed , a statistical distribution of the velocity typically decreases _ exponentially sharply _ as the velocity exceeds some characteristic value @xmath330 : for high temperature @xmath331 , the boltzmann distribution of energy is relevant and , therefore , @xmath332 ; for low temperatures , the fermi distribution is relevant and , therefore , @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the fermi energy . on the other hand , in the range of small @xmath61 ,",
    "the function @xmath335 does not significantly change even if @xmath61 changes by a few times .",
    "hence , if @xmath336 ( where @xmath337 denotes the @xmath61 value corresponding to @xmath330 ) , then the frequency @xmath270 of the partial ( i.e. for a given value of @xmath338 ) 1st - order spike is nearly the same for most of the velocities in the relevant range @xmath339 , and it is approximately equal to @xmath340 $ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath341 .",
    "thus , as a function of @xmath15 for fixed @xmath342 , the dc - conductivity should have a sharp maximum for @xmath343 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath61 is time - dependent ( e.g. if the external magnetic field has an ac component or / and there is an ac electric force perpendicular to the @xmath323-direction ) , then the applications may be similar , with the only difference that the values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 in the minima of the main spikes differ from those for the additive perturbation , see fig .",
    "13 and the related discussion .",
    "the results of the present paper may also be of direct relevance for a pendulum spinning about its vertical axis @xcite , provided the friction is small . the periodic driving may be easily introduced mechanically , or electrically if the pendulum is electrically charged , or magnetically if the pendulum includes a ferromagnetic material .    finally , we mention in this subsection that potentials similar to @xmath90 ( 1 ) , i.e. periodic potentials with two different - height barriers per period , may readily be generated for cold atoms by means of optical lattices @xcite . the dissipation may be suppressed by means of the detuning from the atomic resonance @xcite .",
    "then the results of our paper are also of direct relevance to such systems .      consider the noise - induced escape over a potential barrier in the presence of a non - adiabatic periodic driving .",
    "for a moderately weak damping , such a driving decreases the activation barrier due to the resonant pushing the system in the range of resonant energies @xcite .",
    "if the damping is even smaller , the decrease of the activation barrier becomes larger , due , however , to a different mechanism , typically related to the chaotic layer associated with the separatrix of the unperturbed system @xcite .",
    "the lower energy boundary of the layer is smaller than the potential barrier energy , so it is sufficient that the noise pulls the system right to this boundary ( rather than to the very top of the potential barrier ) , after which the system may escape over the barrier purely dynamically .",
    "if the eigenfrequency as a function of the energy possesses a local maximum , then the effect may be even more pronounced @xcite : the decrease of the activation barrier may become comparable to the potential barrier at unusually small amplitudes of the driving , provided the driving frequency is close to the extremal eigenfrequency .",
    "one of the main mechanisms of the latter effect is closely related to phenomena discussed in the present paper . in the case of escape over",
    "_ two _ barriers of different heights , the effect should become even more pronounced due to the mechanism responsible for the spikes of @xmath0 studied in the present paper . if the potential is periodic , e.g. like in optical lattices @xcite , the effect may lead to a drastic acceleration of the spatial diffusion .      our results may be applied to the stochastic web formation @xcite .",
    "if a harmonic oscillator is perturbed by a plane wave whose frequency is equal to the oscillator eigenfrequency or its multiple , then the perturbation plays two roles @xcite . on one hand , due to the resonance with the oscillator",
    ", it transforms the structure of the phase space of the oscillator , leading to an infinite number of cells divided by a unique separatrix .",
    "it has the form of a web of an infinite radius . on the other hand , the perturbation dresses \" this separatrix by an exponentially narrow chaotic layer ( it is sometimes called stochastic  layer ) .",
    "such a web - like layer is called _",
    "stochastic web_. it may lead to chaotic transport of the system for rather long distances both in coordinate and in energy .    in case when either the resonance is not exact or / and the unperturbed oscillator possesses some nonlinearity , the perturbation generates _ many _ separatrices embedded into each other @xcite rather than one single infinite web - like separatrix .",
    "then a significant chaotic transport in energy may arise only if the magnitude of the perturbation exceeds some critical value corresponding to the overlap of chaotic layers associated , at least , with two neighbouring separatrices . and",
    ", still , the transport in energy remains limited since the width of the chaotic layer around each separatrix sharply decreases as the energy increases .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that some types of additional time - periodic perturbation lead to a low - frequency dipole perturbation of the resonance system ( cf .",
    "the paragraph preceding eq .",
    "the structure of separatrices in the reduced system possesses properties similar to that of the system considered in the present paper .",
    "indeed , in the region between the separatrices , the resonance system performs regular oscillations , and the frequency of such oscillations , as function of the value of the resonance hamiltonian , is equal to zero at each of the separatrices .",
    "thus , it necessarily possesses a local maximum between energies corresponding to any two neighbouring separatrices , like in the case considered in the present paper .",
    "if the additional perturbation has an optimal frequency related to one of these local maxima , then the overlap of chaotic layers associated with neighbouring separatrices is greatly facilitated , similarly to the case considered in the present paper .",
    "moreover , the local maximum of the eigenfrequency changes from pair to pair of separatrices _ weakly _ , so that if the magnitude of the auxiliary perturbation exceeds the critical value even slightly the simultaneous overlap between _ many _",
    "chaotic layers may occur .",
    "then , the distance of the chaotic transport in energy greatly increases .",
    "similar applications are relevant for the so called homogeneous ( sometimes called periodic ) stochastic webs @xcite and many other web - like stochastic structures @xcite .    beside classical systems",
    ", stochastic webs may arise in quantum systems too .",
    "it was recently demonstrated , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that the stochastic web may play a crucial role in quantum electron transport in semiconductor superlattices subjected to stationary electric and magnetic fields . due to the spatial periodicity with a period of about a few nanometers ,",
    "the system possesses narrow minibands in the electron spectrum .",
    "it turns out that the description of the electron transport in the lowest miniband may be approximated by the model of a classical harmonic oscillator driven by a plane wave .",
    "the role of the harmonic oscillator is played by the cyclotron motion while the wave arises due to the interplay between the cyclotron motion and bloch oscillations .",
    "if the cyclotron and bloch frequencies are commensurate , then the phase space of such a system is threaded by a stochastic web .",
    "this gives rise to the delocalization of electron orbits , that leads in turn to a strong increase of the conductivity @xcite .",
    "however , this effect occurs only when the ratio between the electric and magnetic fields lies in the _ exponentially narrow _ regions corresponding to nearly integer ratios between the bloch and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "the results of the present work suggest a method for a significant increase of the width of the relevant regions .",
    "if the cyclotron and bloch frequencies are not exactly commensurate , then the stochastic web does not arise : rather a set of embedded separatrices arises provided the effective wave amplitude is sufficiently large . as discussed in the previous paragraph ,",
    "even a rather weak time - periodic driving @xcite of the optimal frequency may significantly increase the area of the phase space involved in the chaotic transport .",
    "this may provide for an effective control of the electron transport in such a system and may be used for developing electronic devices that exploit the intrinsic sensitivity of chaos ( cf .",
    "a similar effect may be used also to control transmission through other periodic structures , e.g. ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "we have developed a new _ general approach _ for the treatment of separatrix chaos .",
    "this has allowed us to create a self - contained theory for the drastic facilitation of the global chaos onset between adjacent separatrices of a i d hamiltonian system subject to a time - periodic perturbation .",

    "for odd numbers @xmath559 , there are separatrices which lie in the range of @xmath10 where @xmath560 i.e. much closer to the barrier than the tangent trajectory : these separatrices are therefore irrelevant .      in case of a _ moderately _ small @xmath61 , they may intersect the gss curve . and then , the tangent trajectory lying above the separatrix necessarily exists , so that the boundary of the layer is formed by this tangent trajectory .    for any",

    "the lower chaotic layer relates to the _ bounded _ separatrix while , for the upper ( unbounded ) layer , it is the _ lower _ boundary of the layer which is relevant for the onset of global chaos in between the separatrices .",
    "moreover , even for the upper boundary of the upper layer , the divergence is not yet manifested for the driving parameters @xmath561 in the vicinity of the spikes minima ( cf ."
