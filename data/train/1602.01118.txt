    "stochastic transport processes have been studied for a long time to understand fundamental principles in various physical and non - physical systems on a wide range of length - scales .",
    "originally introduced to study properties of interacting markov processes by spitzer  @xcite , they were found to be versatile enough to provide mappings or models of more realistic systems .",
    "for instance , extended versions of the asymmetric exclusion process and related models have been used to model intracellular locomotion of molecular motors  @xcite as well as vehicular and other traffic  @xcite . to us , another interesting field of application is the modeling and understanding of general condensation phenomena that are observed in a broad range of physical systems , such as colloidal and granular systems  @xcite , the formation of breath figures  @xcite , the condensation on inhomogeneous networks  @xcite , the aggregation of links in networks  @xcite as well as in a variety of other contexts  @xcite .",
    "some stochastic transport processes , in general driven far from equilibrium , lend themselves to this domain due to their relative simplicity , the occurrence of phase separation and the resulting rich phase structures being present already in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "for example , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) features a phase diagram with a maximum current , as well as a low - density and a high - density phase induced by externally driven particle exchange at the system boundaries  @xcite .",
    "another well - known example for the occurrence of phase separation in a one - dimensional stochastic transport model is the zero - range process ( zrp )  @xcite , where particles on the same site interact non - exclusively : with appropriate dynamics , this model features a condensation transition with a coexisting localized particle condensate and a `` fluid '' background or bulk phase . for sufficiently high particle density @xmath0 ,",
    "the translational symmetry breaks down spontaneously and a condensate containing a finite fraction of particles emerges at a single site in the system while the remaining particles form the bulk of the system .",
    "this condensation model within the zrp has been extensively discussed in the literature , so that a wide host of properties is well known and many related models were proposed and studied .",
    "for example , a model with nearest - neighbour interactions proposed by evans et al .",
    "@xcite features formation of spatially extended condensates , a property the zrp lacks due to its interaction range being zero . in this model ,",
    "the stationary state factorizes over lattice bonds instead of sites as for the zrp , which is why it is often referred to as the pair - factorized steady states ( pfss ) model , mainly to distinguish from the fully factorized steady state of the zrp .",
    "many stationary properties of the condensed state in this family of models such as the condensate s shape and length scale  @xcite , mobility  @xcite , metastability of the condensate  @xcite or boundary induced phase separation  @xcite were studied .    besides these interesting stationary properties of the condensed state of these models , the dynamics that lead to it are of interest to the study of general condensation phenomena .",
    "in this paper we will discuss the dynamics of the condensation process for the pfss model as well as the zrp .",
    "specifically we will determine and discuss the time scales of the two main steps of the relaxation process from a random initial state to the final stationary distribution where a single condensate contains the entire excess particles of the system .",
    "these general steps are the _ nucleation _ and _ coarsening _ processes as in the well - known picture of ostwald ripening  @xcite .",
    "classical theories of precipitation in this context are the szilard ",
    "farkas and becker  dring models  @xcite for nucleation and the lifshitz ",
    "wagner model  @xcite in the coarsening regime .",
    "nucleation is the initial diffusive accumulation of several particles to small droplets that are larger than the typical fluctuations in the critical background of the relaxed system .",
    "coarsening refers to the growth of some droplets and the evaporation of smaller ones until only a single large droplet persists and the steady state is reached . while the steady state might be in non - equilibrium due to an external drive and particle transport , this process irreversibly relaxes the system from a non - equilibrium state towards the stationary distribution .",
    "the time scale of these processes refers to the dependence of the nucleation and coarsening times to the size of the system .    for the zrp",
    ", the nucleation and coarsening steps and the corresponding time scales have been treated analytically for symmetric as well as totally asymmetric dynamics by grosskinsky et  al .",
    "@xcite . in an earlier study",
    "the coarsening time scale of a finite zrp has been determined by interpreting the size of the largest condensate as a bounded and biased random walk and calculating the first - passage time when the largest condensate absorbed any particles of a smaller condensate  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will extend these considerations for the zrp to the generalized pfss condensation model proposed by evans et  al .",
    "@xcite featuring short - range interactions .",
    "while this allows us to create more realistic models of transport phenomena , its mathematical structure remains simple and similar to the zrp .",
    "most importantly here is , that the introduction of nearest - neighbour interactions allows the emergence of spatially extended condensates .",
    "in fact , variations of the hopping dynamics have been proposed that lead to interesting properties of the condensate , such as a tunable envelope shape and scaling of the condensate width  @xcite . in a recent contribution we discussed another variant as a toy model in the context of thin film growth  @xcite , were the system starts empty and condensation gradually takes place as particles are deposited from the outside .",
    "we are therefore interested in comparing the nucleation and coarsening processes of extended droplets in this model to those observed in the zrp and specifically determine the respective time scales .",
    "we will continue as follows .",
    "we first introduce the zrp and pfss models and discuss the expected time scales in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] . in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we discuss the numerical methods employed to simulate the dynamics and track the condensation process .",
    "we will further describe our considered methods to compute the time scale exponents from the trajectories . in secs .",
    "[ sec : nucleation ] and [ sec : coarsening ] , we compare our results for the condensation time scales of the zrp and pfss processes respectively . finally , the last sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains the conclusions of our work .",
    "we consider condensation phenomena in two related models of stochastic transport processes : the zero - range process ( zrp ) and the pair - factorized steady states ( pfss ) model .",
    "the zrp is a minimal model of a particle - hopping stochastic transport process with local interactions only .",
    "the pfss model introduces nearest - neighbour interactions additionally to the zero - range interactions of the zrp .",
    "we will use the simpler zrp to setup and validate our methods to estimate the time scales of the condensation process in the latter model .    in both models",
    "the system consists of a number of indistinguishable particles that occupy the sites of a lattice or graph .",
    "the number of particles occupying a specific site @xmath1 is called the occupation number @xmath2 and can be any integer value @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total particle number in a system of @xmath5 sites . at every step of the stochastic process a site @xmath1 in the lattice",
    "is randomly selected for trial of particle hopping .",
    "if the site is occupied , hopping of a single particle succeeds with the hopping rate @xmath6 per unit time and the particle hops to a neighbour of its departure site .",
    "random choice of the hopping target leads to an equilibrium system , while a biased choice can lead to a system driven far from equilibrium .",
    "we will consider the case of the one - dimensional periodic lattice , where such a drive is easily implemented by a probability @xmath7 of the particle to hop to the nearest neighbour in negative direction of the lattice and in positive direction with probability @xmath8 .",
    "for any given lattice and number of particles @xmath9 the individual dynamics of the particles in these models are therefore fully described by the hopping rate function and the strength of the bias in the hopping direction .",
    "the general update scheme of this family of processes is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : zrp - scheme ] .",
    "a particle is taken with probability @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and then moved to sites @xmath12 or @xmath13 with probability @xmath7 or @xmath8 , respectively . ]",
    "the zrp was originally proposed to model a set of non - exclusively interacting random walks by spitzer  @xcite .",
    "it is constructed to be analytically tractable and has , for symmetric as well as asymmetric dynamics , always the same factorised stationary distribution @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a specific configuration of the system .",
    "the factorisation of the steady state is carried out over the single - site weight functions @xmath16 for all sites .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath17 used here has the same role as the partition function in an equilibrium model and the kronecker symbol @xmath18 ensures the conservation of particles . with the choice of the weight function @xmath19 the hopping rate function",
    "then becomes @xmath20 it is easy to check that this leads to the steady state ( [ eq : steady - state - zrp ] ) by inserting ( [ eq : weights - zrp ] ) and ( [ eq : hopping - weights - zrp ] ) into the master equation @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the transition rates are @xmath22 for a hop to the left ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 for a hop to the right ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 otherwise .    in this work",
    "we consider the well - known zrp condensation model  @xcite with hopping rate function @xmath27 for this choice of dynamics , condensation occurs for above a critical density of @xmath28 .",
    "when the total number of particles is increased above the condensation threshold @xmath29 , the translational symmetry breaks down and the excess particles @xmath30 condense at a single site in the system .",
    "the occupation number of the rest of the system remains on average at the critical density @xmath31 . for illustration ,",
    "the average mass of the largest droplet @xmath32 during a complete condensation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleation - coarsening ] for a number of system sizes with totally asymmetric dynamics .",

    "@xcite assumes a power - law in the system size of the form @xmath33 that is also observed for other relaxation processes in the zrp with different dynamics  @xcite . to estimate the nucleation time scale , grosskinsky et al .",
    "propose a mass threshold @xmath34 for a droplet nuclei and calculate the time it takes to populate the system with such nuclei .",
    "for the choice of a threshold linear in the system size @xmath35 , with some constant @xmath36 , they estimate the scaling exponent of the nucleation time as @xmath37 for symmetric ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 for totally asymmetric ( @xmath40 ) dynamics . the coarsening time is dominated by the typical time for a droplet to loose all particles , which is determined using the fact that for the zrp the evaporation rate of a droplet is simply the hopping rate for the droplet mass .    .",
    "the two groups of curves show the same data .",
    "the upper group , plotted versus the top and left axes , is merely rescaled in time by @xmath41 and in mass by @xmath42 in order to collapse the trajectories of different system sizes to a single master curve for late times , as shown in the upper inset .",
    "the lower group , plotted versus the lower and right axes , is shown without rescaling .",
    "the lower inset shows the weak dependence of droplet growth on system size in the early condensation dynamics .",
    "the curves were determined for totally asymmetric dynamics @xmath40 using 1000 trajectories per size @xmath43 . ]",
    "the basic pfss short - range interaction transport process differs from the zrp by taking the interactions between particles on adjacent sites into account .",
    "this is realized by replacing the single - site weight @xmath16 of the zrp with a two - point weight function @xmath44 for each bond in the system .",
    "the stationary distribution of this process then assumes the form @xmath45 i.e.  it factorizes over pairs of sites , giving rise to the name _ pair - factorized steady states ( pfss ) _ transport process . here",
    "the bond weight function @xmath44 is a positive and in our case symmetric function .",
    "the corresponding hopping rate function that controls the dynamics of the process is determined similarly as for the zrp using the master equation   with appropriate transition rates @xmath46 for a hop to the left ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath47 for a hop to the right ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 otherwise . the resulting hopping rate function",
    "is then given by @xmath48    a compelling general choice of the bond weight is to use the factorized form @xmath49 , with a zero - range site weight function @xmath16 as in the zrp and a short - range part @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the zrp is easily reproduced as a special case by setting @xmath51 and a broad range of interactions can be implemented by interpreting the partial weights @xmath16 as a particle - site potential and @xmath52 as a particle - particle interaction term . due to the ranged interactions",
    "there is now the possibility that spatially extended condensates emerge in the system .",
    "a number of specific weights and thus dynamics have been considered in the literature for this model , such as that suggested in its original proposition by evans et  al .",
    "@xcite or the tunable interactions resulting in various condensate shapes @xcite .",
    "the main question that we are going to resolve in this work , is whether the nucleation and coarsening dynamics of condensation in this model with short - range interactions takes place on the same time scale as for the zrp . to do this",
    ", we will consider the dynamics suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite given by the partial weights @xmath53 here , @xmath54 gives the strength of an on - site potential and @xmath55 can be interpreted as a surface energy . in this work , we will only explicitly discuss the case @xmath56 , although we did check different parametrisations as well as different dynamics with pair - factorized steady states featuring condensation . inserting this into the eq .",
    "gives the hopping rate function @xmath57 as an illustration of this dynamics , fig .",
    "[ fig : condensation - sample ] shows a time series of configurations from a random initial state to the stationary state with a single condensate .    for this choice of dynamics",
    "the critical density can be determined as @xmath58 for parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60  @xcite . above this density an extended condensate of roughly parabolic shape containing the excess particles @xmath61 emerges .",
    "the exact shape can be determined as well  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the condensate scales as the square root of its mass @xmath62 for sufficiently large systems  @xcite . because of the spatial extension as well as the smooth shape of the droplets , and ultimately the remaining single condensate , it is non - trivial to reproduce either the analytical or the qualitative arguments for the nucleation and coarsening time scales in this case .",
    "therefore , in this work , we perform numerical simulations of both the zrp and pfss model to calibrate our methods by the zrp results and determine the time - scale exponents for the pfss process using the power - law ansatz as for the zrp .",
    "we employ a kinetic monte carlo method with discrete time steps that directly simulates the dynamics of the considered transport processes . per time step",
    ", every lattice site is considered on average once for a local update that consists of the following steps : a site @xmath1 with @xmath63 is randomly and uniformly chosen and , if occupied , the hopping rate @xmath64 for that site is determined according to   or  .",
    "a particle leaves the site , with the probability @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the maximal hopping rate for the given model .",
    "the particle then enters the left ( @xmath12 ) or right ( @xmath13 ) neighbour with probability @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . at the boundary sites @xmath67 we consider periodic boundary conditions , so that the left neighbour of the first site and the right neighbour of the last site are identified as the last and first site respectively .",
    "because of the definition of the hopping rate in events per physical time unit , a monte carlo _ sweep _ of @xmath5 single - site updates corresponds to @xmath68 units of physical time . by repeating this update procedure , a single trajectory of configurations @xmath69 is generated .",
    "in contrast to steady - state simulations , where an observable can be estimated from a large number of observations in a single trajectory , here every trajectory contributes only a single observation to the estimation of the typical nucleation and coarsening times . to determine a sufficiently good estimate for the scaling exponents we hence generated on the order of several thousand trajectories for every parametrisation .",
    "nucleation is the first stage of the condensation process , covering the formation of particle droplet nuclei from the bulk system until the bulk phase is relaxed and coarsening takes over .",
    "since the number of particles in the system @xmath70 is conserved , the initial configuration is prepared using a uniform distribution of particles . for any supercritical density @xmath71",
    "the system then contains @xmath72 excess particles that settle at random sites forming droplets . in the case of the zrp ,",
    "such a droplet is just a larger number of particles on a single site with respect to the occupation number distribution in the bulk of the system .",
    "the mass of a droplet , that is the number of contained particles , is therefore equal to the occupation number at its location for the zrp . in the pfss model , where droplets are in general extended ,",
    "we require separation by at least one site with occupation below the critical density @xmath73 , that is @xmath74 in both models for the parameters considered in this paper .",
    "the sum of occupation numbers in the droplet region then defines its mass .    to gain a basic understanding of the involved time scales determining the nucleation process",
    ", we can somewhat generalize the heuristic approximation of the scaling exponent for the zrp by grosskinsky et al .",
    "when the typical cluster mass is assumed to be linear in the system size @xmath75 , it follows that there are on the order of @xmath76 droplets in the system .",
    "the density of droplets in turn determines the average free distance that particles travel to a nuclei .",
    "the time , in units of single hops , for on the order of @xmath5 particles to travel a distance of order @xmath5 is then roughly @xmath77 for totally asymmetric dynamics and @xmath78 including diffusive motion due to symmetric dynamics .",
    "the choice of the typical droplet mass being linear in the system size ensures that droplets are distinctly larger than random fluctuations , which are of order @xmath79}}^{1/(b-1)}$ ] for the zrp  @xcite , where @xmath80 is the gamma function .",
    "however , assuming a different functional dependence of the typical droplet mass , such as a proportionality to the square root of the excess particles @xmath81 , results in a change of the time scale as well : on the order of @xmath82 particles travelling for a mean free distance of order @xmath82 sites yields a time scale of order @xmath5 for asymmetric and @xmath83 for symmetric dynamics .",
    "because of this , we will first reproduce and compare the time scale for nucleation in the zrp before proceeding to the pfss model .",
    "furthermore , we will consider three types of typical droplet masses of the form @xmath84 to check our former assumptions and compare the resulting kinetics .",
    "the additional threshold @xmath85 independent of the system size is motivated as follows .",
    "the critical droplet size in the nucleation regime is the size of a droplet for which its growth rate becomes faster than its decay rate .",
    "for the single - site droplets in the zrp , we can determine this size by evaluating the droplet growth in the vicinity of the critical droplet size @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the probability to find @xmath89 particles on the adjacent sites . as the bulk should relax within the nucleation time",
    ", we can assume that @xmath90 is the mass distribution of the zrp , that is @xmath91 with the chemical potential @xmath92 in the grand - canonical system and thus @xmath93 for a fixed number of particles .",
    "we can now find the critical value as @xmath94}}$ ] which is @xmath95 for the interaction strength @xmath96 used here and set our threshold including a small safety margin to @xmath97 .    to determine the nucleation time scale using numerical simulations",
    ", we will compute the transition time when the coarsening of droplets starts to dominate the kinetics of the system , that is the formation of new droplets of at least the typical mass @xmath34 becomes smaller than the evaporation of existing ones .",
    "this is achieved by counting the number of droplets that have at least the typical mass ( threshold mass ) at every time in the trajectory and computing its average over many trajectories .",
    "the scaling exponent is then determined visually for the best data collapse assuming the power law  .",
    "( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f )     to compare with the results of grosskinsky et  al .",
    "@xcite and validate our numerical methods , we use a similar parameter set with system sizes of @xmath98 , and @xmath99 sites , interaction strength @xmath96 , yielding @xmath100 , and somewhat more variation in the particle density @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . to compute the average droplet - count function @xmath103 we simulated 1200 trajectories for each combination of parameters with totally asymmetric ( @xmath40 ) as well as symmetric ( @xmath38 ) dynamics .",
    "we then rescaled the average droplet counts to achieve a good collapse for different system sizes and get the scaling with respect to the mass thresholds  .",
    "figure  [ fig : nucleation - zrp ] shows that these results indeed reflect the heuristic approximations made for the different assumptions of the typical droplet mass @xmath34 .",
    "the curves of the droplet counts collapse in two ways .",
    "firstly , for identical values of the particle density @xmath0 there is a collapse for individual system sizes @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , for the size - dependent thresholds and asymmetric dynamics , this collapse increases with the particle density and a common master curve is approached . for typical droplet masses",
    "@xmath85 independent of the system size , the collapse for different @xmath5 within the same density is remarkable .",
    "while this might to some extent reflect the higher absolute value of droplet counts and thus greater amount of self - averaging in that situation , it also suggests that this assumption is indeed physical .",
    "the rescaling factors in the vertical axis for the mass thresholds @xmath85 and @xmath104 reflect the respective expected number of droplets per system size according to the heuristic approximation . comparing with ref .",
    "@xcite , that is specifically for typical droplet sizes @xmath35 linear in the system size with @xmath105 , our value of the scaling exponent @xmath106 is consistent with the value determined for the assumption therein .",
    "while the droplet mass threshold in the original work by grosskinsky et al .",
    "@xcite is chosen to ensure that such droplets are distinct from fluctuations of order @xmath79}}^{1/(b-1)}$ ] in the initial system for any value of the interaction strength @xmath107 , our assumption @xmath104 fulfills this requirement as well for the considered interaction strength of @xmath96 .",
    "additionally , we performed a similar amount of simulations for @xmath108 yielding very similar results . considering that the data collapse for @xmath104 and @xmath109 is equally good , we would then suggest that , if the duration of the nucleation regime can be limited in this approach , the systematically smaller yet valid assumption of the typical droplet size should be physical .    ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f )     finally , as the third assumption for the typical droplet size @xmath85 , we use our estimate of the critical droplet size for the zrp @xmath97 although it becomes smaller than the expected fluctuations in the initial configuration for larger systems .",
    "this is visible in figs .",

    "we find most notably the strong dependence of the scaling exponent of the nucleation time on the choice of the typical droplet mass that acts as a marker to the end of the regime .",
    "the determined exponents for the zrp for the three choices of the typical droplet mass , for totally asymmetric and symmetric dynamics respectively , are @xmath222 and @xmath129 for @xmath223 linear in the excess mass , @xmath224 and @xmath128 for @xmath225 linear in the square root of the excess mass and @xmath226 for @xmath85 independent of the system size .",
    "these exponents were also expected using a simple heuristic approximation of the involved time scales .",
    "the almost perfect data collapse of the droplet - count function for the threshold based on our approximation of the critical droplet size for the zrp suggests that indeed the assumption of a typical droplet mass @xmath85 that is an intensive variable , i.e.  does not depend on the system size , is physical for the zrp and the pfss model as well .",
    "however , considering the versatility of these models allowing a large variety of mappings to other models , the freedom to choose the type of the droplet mass threshold with respect to such a mapping and obtain an appropriate nucleation time scale seems to be of advantage .",
    "for the pair - factorized steady states model we determined scaling exponents using the same types of typical droplet masses with differences in the prefactors to account for the larger extended droplets .",
    "remarkably , our obtained values of these exponents directly correspond to those of the zrp plus a shift of @xmath121 towards longer nucleation times for the considered droplet mass thresholds that depend on the system size .",
    "the specific values , for totally asymmetric and symmetric dynamics , are @xmath227 and @xmath131 for the threshold @xmath109 linear in the excess mass , @xmath228 and @xmath126 for @xmath104 linear in the square root of the excess mass and @xmath229 for the threshold @xmath85 independent of the system size .    it would be rewarding for further research to study the details of the involved nucleation processes that lead to the observed relation between the exponents for the pfss and those of the zrp .",
    "furthermore , it is worth studying the crossover to the coarsening regime in stochastic transport processes in more detail .    for the coarsening time scale exponents we determined results employing two independent numerical methods .",
    "to test these , we first reproduced the scaling exponents of the zrp determined analytically and numerically by grosskinsky et al .",
    "@xcite for symmetric as well as totally asymmetric dynamics .",
    "our results for the scaling exponents of the coarsening times are @xmath230 and @xmath231 as well as @xmath232 and @xmath233 for the pfss model , both for symmetric and totally asymmetric dynamics respectively .",
    "in contrast to the nucleation regime , the coarsening exponents of the zrp and pfss models match very well suggesting that , although the early condensation dynamics differ , the coarsening process in these processes is much more similar .",
    "we supplemented these values with results for partially asymmetric dynamics and showed the transition in the observed coarsening times from symmetric to predominantly asymmetric dynamics at @xmath234 from @xmath133 to @xmath126 accompanied by a distinct change in the prefactor of the scaling .",
    "this is most likely due to the finite system size . for the pfss in the coarsening regime we discussed results for the scaling exponents with symmetric , as well as partially and totally asymmetric dynamics .",
    "we were not able to directly observe such a transition in the coarsening exponents from @xmath133 to @xmath126 for very weakly asymmetric dynamics as for the zrp , due to the increase in the computational costs for such parametrisations .",
    "the prefactor of the scaling , however , rapidly increases for nearly symmetric dynamics as observed for the zrp as well .",
