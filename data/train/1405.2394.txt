    "the @xmath4he nucleus is a prominent example of a  halo nucleus \"  @xcite .",
    "its two - neutron separation energy , @xmath14 mev , which is much less than the excitation energy of @xmath15he , @xmath16 mev .",
    "the last two neutrons in @xmath4he thus exist in states whose probability distribution extends well beyond that of the @xmath15he core .",
    "this encourages a treatment of @xmath4he as an effective three - body problem , with @xmath15he and the two valence neutrons as degrees of freedom . in these terms @xmath4he is a borromean system , since none of its two - body subsystems are bound , and the existence of the @xmath4he bound state is a genuine three - body phenomenon . other neutron - rich nuclei including @xmath17li , @xmath18c  @xcite , and , perhaps , @xmath19ca",
    "@xcite , can also be viewed as borromean systems .",
    "however , @xmath4he is special , since it is today accessible to _ ab initio _ methods which compute its structure directly from a hamiltonian which contains state - of - the - art two - nucleon and three - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",
    "these calculations confront experimental data on @xmath10  @xcite and the charge  @xcite and matter radii  @xcite of @xmath4he .",
    "thus @xmath4he provides an ideal testbed to study the extent to which an effective cluster description of the halo dynamics captures essential properties of this nucleus , and when _ ab initio _ methods are absolutely necessary .",
    "descriptions of @xmath4he in a three - body ansatz have traditionally been implemented in models , with the @xmath20 and @xmath6 potentials determined by fitting the observed properties of the two - body subsystems . in particular , the low - energy @xmath21s@xmath22 @xmath6 phase shift and the @xmath23s@xmath24 , @xmath23p@xmath24 and @xmath23p@xmath8 @xmath20 phase shifts were taken into consideration . in the early 1970s ,",
    "much work was devoted to this topic , with ghovanlou and lehman studying in detail which features of these phase shifts have an impact on the @xmath4he binding energy  @xcite .",
    "they found that a model which only includes the @xmath6 resonance in the @xmath21s@xmath22 channel and the ",
    "@xmath25he \" resonance in the @xmath23p@xmath8 @xmath20 channel leads to overbinding of @xmath4he .",
    "the binding energy could be reduced by including other channels .",
    "three - body cluster models of @xmath4he as a @xmath12 system which included more sophisticated input for the @xmath26 and @xmath6 potentials were constructed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; two - neutron separation energies ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 mev were found .",
    "cluster descriptions of halo systems are now enjoying a renaissance , thanks to the application of effective field theory ( eft ) methods to these systems .",
    "eft provides a systematic expansion in a ratio of low- to high - momentum scales .",
    "halo nuclei enjoy a separation of these scales , since there is a low - momentum scale , @xmath29 , associated with the binding of the valence neutrons , while the high - momentum scale , @xmath30 , is set by the excitation energy of the nuclear core .",
    "consequently , in the case of systems where all three participating particles interact in s - waves , two - neutron halo nuclei share universal features with the three - nucleon system  @xcite , the @xmath15he trimer  @xcite , and cold atomic systems where three atoms interact near a feshbach resonance . for a review of this connection see ref .",
    "@xcite . particularly exciting is the possibility that the efimov physics  @xcite , having been seen experimentally in recombination rates in cold atomic gases  @xcite , could also exhibit its existence in halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a variety of s - wave 2@xmath1 halos ( e.g. @xmath31be and @xmath32c ) were investigated at leading  @xcite and next - to - leading  @xcite order in the @xmath33 expansion by canham and hammer .",
    "recently hagen _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that @xmath19ca could also be an s - wave halo that displayed efimovian features  @xcite .",
    "the existence and universal features of s - wave 2@xmath1 halos have also been studied by yamashita _",

    "electromagnetic properties of neutron halos were analyzed in the eft framework in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to three - body systems including only s - wave interactions , two of the three pairwise interactions in @xmath0he are dominated by p - wave interactions .",
    "the @xmath20 interaction has a low - energy resonance in the @xmath23p@xmath8 partial wave , as well as an enhanced phase shift in the @xmath23p@xmath24 where the resonance is much broader .",
    "the first eft treatment of @xmath20 scattering was carried out by bertulani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who treated both the p - wave scattering volume @xmath34 , and the p - wave effective  range \" , @xmath35 , as unnaturally enhanced  i.e . , they assumed two fine tunings ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "in contrast , bedaque _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath23p@xmath8 @xmath20 resonance could be well described by the power counting of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the resonance s width is only re - summed in its immediate vicinity .",
    "therefore they assigned only the scaling necessary to have a low - energy resonance : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , thereby requiring only one fine tuning .",
    "it is this counting we will use in our present study .",
    "we observe that the @xmath20 @xmath40 scattering parameters @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44  @xcite are consistent with the low- and high - momentum scales @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev in @xmath4he ( @xmath47 denotes the nucleon mass ) .",

    "any such differences are certainly smaller than the intrinsic uncertainty in our leading - order calculation . ]    in contrast , the recent paper of rotureau and van kolck  @xcite adopted the power counting of ref .",
    "@xcite , and then applied the gamow shell model to solve @xmath4he as a three - body problem . in our conclusion",
    "we will compare our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another recent study of the three - body problem with resonant pairwise p - wave interactions , which employed the power counting of ref .",
    "@xcite , was carried out by braaten _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors attempted to find a scale - free situation in the two - body problem , and examine the corresponding behavior in the three - body problem .",
    "in order to do so they took a p - wave  unitary limit \" @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , as pointed out by nishida  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) this p - wave unitary limit is not physical : it yields a two - body spectrum in which one low - energy state has negative norm .",
    "thus the discrete scale invariance discovered by braaten _",
    "_ in the corresponding three - body problem can not be realized in nature .",
    "this provides strong motivation for us to employ the ",

    "[ sec:2body - he6 ] , we discuss the properties of the @xmath6 and @xmath20 interactions employed in our work together with their low - energy expansions based on this power counting .",
    "we explain the eft renormalization procedures which allow us to start from a two - body interaction and obtain the pertinent t - matrices .",
    "these t - matrices are then inserted into three - body faddeev equations , for which we solve the homogeneous version in order to determine the @xmath4he ground state energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : jacobi - he6 ] we discuss the spin and angular - momentum coupling of the three particles which leads to a @xmath52 state of @xmath4he . in sec .",

    "we find that the ground - state energy is not determined by two - body input alone .",
    "instead , it depends strongly on the cutoff in the three - body equations .",

    "<S> background : :    in recent years properties of light rare isotopes have been measured    with high accuracy . at the same time , the theoretical description of    light nuclei has made enormous progress , and properties of , e.g. , the    helium isotopes can now be calculated _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio_. these advances make    those rare isotopes an ideal testing ground for effective field    theories ( efts ) built upon cluster degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    systems with widely separated intrinsic scales are well suited to an    eft treatment . the borromean halo nucleus @xmath0he exhibits    such a separation of scales . in this work </S>",
    "<S> an eft in which the degrees    of freedom are the valence neutrons ( @xmath1 ) and an inert    @xmath2he - core ( @xmath3 ) is employed . </S>",
    "<S> the    properties of @xmath4he can then be calculated using the    momentum - space faddeev equations for the @xmath5 bound    state to obtain information on @xmath4he at leading order    ( lo ) within the eft . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the @xmath6 virtual state and the    @xmath7p@xmath8 resonance in @xmath9he    give the two - body amplitudes which are input to our lo three - body halo    eft calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that without a genuine three - body interaction    the two - neutron separation energy @xmath10 of    @xmath4he is strongly cutoff dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a    @xmath11 `` three - body '' operator which renormalizes the    system , adjusting its coefficient to reproduce the    @xmath10 of @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> the faddeev components are    then cutoff independent for cutoffs of the order of , and above , the    breakdown scale of the halo eft . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    as in the case of a three - body system where only resonant s - wave    interactions are present , one three - body input is required for the    renormalization of the eft equations that describe @xmath0he    at lo . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to the s - wave - only case , the running of    the lo @xmath12 counterterm does not exhibit discrete    scale invariance , due to the presence of the p - wave    @xmath13 interaction . </S>"
