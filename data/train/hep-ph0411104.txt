    "the discovery of the @xmath0 baryon by leps collaboration at spring-8 @xcite and subsequent confirmation in the other experiments  @xcite have spurred a lot of works in the field of exotic hadrons .",
    "so far , not much is known about the properties of the @xmath0 except its mass , which is about 1540 mev , and its small decay width , which is smaller than the experimental resolutions of around @xmath1 mev .",
    "thus , to determine the quantum numbers as well as other properties of @xmath0 , various production mechanisms have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 baryon , being a strangeness + 1 state , is exotic since its minimal quark content should be @xmath2 .",
    "other states that have positive strangeness but different charges are not observed  , which suggests that the @xmath0 is an isosinglet .",
    "the existence of such an exotic state with narrow width and spin - parity @xmath3 was first predicted by diakonov _",
    "_ @xcite in the chiral soliton model , where the @xmath0 is a member of the baryon anti - decuplet .",
    "the positive parity is also supported by the constituent quark model with flavor - spin hyperfine interaction  @xcite , the diquark - diquark - antiquark picture of jaffe and wilczek ( jw ) @xcite , the triquark - diquark picture @xcite , the quark potential model calculations @xcite , and the constituent quark model where chiral dynamics are included@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected in a naive constituent quark model that the ground state of the pentaquark have a negative parity because all the quarks would be in the @xmath4-state .",
    "the negative parity is supported by the calculations based on qcd , such as the lattice calculation  @xcite and qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "hence , determining the parity of the pentaquark states will not only be important in establishing the basic quantum numbers of the pentaquark states , but also in understanding the qcd dynamics especially when multiquarks are involved .",
    "currently the results from both lattice qcd@xcite and qcd sum rule@xcite analysis , which show the existence of a negative parity pentaquark state in the isospin zero and spin 1/2 channel , face a challenge to be settled .",
    "in particular , subsequent analysis in the lattice qcd found no stable pentaquark state in the advertised channel@xcite .",
    "similarly , in a different qcd sum rule analysis , the parity was found to be positive  @xcite .",
    "a major uncertainty in both approaches is associated with isolating the pentaquark contribution in the correlation functions between the pentaquark interpolating currents . because the interpolating current can also couple to the two - hadron reducible ( 2hr ) kaon - nucleon ( k - n ) intermediate state , it is difficult to extract signals for the pentaquark state from the theoretical calculation of the two point correlation function .",
    "this is particularly so because the k - n threshold lies below the expected @xmath0 state and neither the borel transformation in the qcd sum rule nor the large imaginary time behavior in the lattice calculation can isolate the @xmath0 state .",
    "hence , it is essential in both approaches to estimate the contribution coming from the k - n intermediate state in the correlation function .",
    "this point has been noted for the qcd sum rule approach by kondo _",
    "et al._@xcite , who claimed that after subtracting out the 2hr part of the operator product expansion(ope ) , one finds that the parity becomes positive .",
    "however , as we will show , subtracting the 2hr contribution in the ope level is an ill - defined approach . instead",
    ", its contribution can be estimated in the phenomenological side .",
    "the magnitude for the overlap of the @xmath0 interpolating current with the kaon - nucleon state is obtained by first applying a chiral rotation to the @xmath0 interpolating current and estimate the kaon overlap in the soft - kaon limit .",
    "we then analyze the qcd sum rule for the nucleon with the resulting pentaquark nucleon interpolating current to estimate the nucleon overlap .",
    "it is found that the k - n intermediate state constitutes only 10% of the sum rule so that the original claim that the parity of @xmath0 is negative remains valid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our method of treating the k - n intermediate state appearing in the correlation function for the @xmath0 sum rule .",
    "we then calculate the overlap of the @xmath0 interpolating field with the k - n intermediate state in section iii . in section iv , we reanalyze the @xmath0 sum rule after subtracting out the k - n intermediate state .",
    "let us begin with the correlation function between the interpolating field for @xmath0 , @xmath5 |0 \\rangle \\label{corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 here the roman indices denote the color , @xmath7 the charge conjugation and the superscript @xmath8 transpose",
    ". the ope of this correlation function has been calculated by sugiyama , doi and oka ( sdo)@xcite and its extension to the anti - charmed pentaquark has been made in ref.@xcite . from comparing the ope to the phenomenological side saturated by the ground state @xmath0 and a continuum ,",
    "sdo were able to identify the parity of the @xmath0 to be negative .",
    "however , as has been noted by kondo , morimatsu and nishikawa ( kmn)@xcite , the correlation function can have two - hadron reducible ( 2hr ) contributions in addition to the two - hadron irreducible ( 2hi ) part .",
    "this means that since @xmath9 is the 5 quark current with a strangeness + 1 , isospin zero , it can also easily couple directly to a kaon - nucleon intermediate state or any of their excited states , namely , @xmath10 where @xmath11 therefore , to extract information about the pentaquarks from the ope calculation , one has to subtract the contributions from the 2hr contributions , @xmath12 in the left hand side ( lhs ) , we are interested in the ground state but the ope part can be calculated for large @xmath13 .",
    "the usual way of matching the two sides with different regions of the momentum is achieved by the borel transformation .",
    "a question in this particular case is how to subtract the 2hr contribution effectively .",
    "kmn suggest to calculate the large @xmath13 limit of @xmath14 using the ope of the @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 under this prescription , kmn found that the contribution from the 2hr is large enough to change the previous result on the @xmath0 parity .",
    "however , a little inspection shows that such factorization is ill - defined .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the ope of the lhs of eq.([kmn ] ) means that it is obtained from the short - distance expansion of the correlator ; namely in the large @xmath13 limit . also being the ope parts , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are obtained in the large @xmath19 and @xmath20 limit respectively . however , there are other important regions of @xmath21 which contribute to the ope of the lhs .",
    "an example of such regions are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".typical momentum regions which contribute to the ope of @xmath14 .",
    "the first line represents the region which has been taken into account through eq.([kmn ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another serious problem with eq.([kmn ] ) is the implicit assumption of @xmath22 which can be shown to be not true in general .      here , we suggest to subtract out the 2hr contribution by explicitly estimating the contribution coming from the non - interacting k - n intermediate state , @xmath23 where @xmath24 there are additional contributions coming from excited kaon or nucleon states . however , these contributions are exponentially suppressed after the borel transformation .",
    "hence , to estimate the lowest 2hr contribution , we need to know the overlap strength in eq.([lambdakn ] ) .",
    "this strength will be estimated in the following section by combining the soft - kaon limit and a sum rule for the nucleon with pentaquark interpolating field .",
    "to calculate the overlap strength @xmath25 , we first use the soft - kaon theorem , @xmath26|n \\rangle & = & -\\frac{1}{f_k } \\langle 0| j_{n,5}|n \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{\\lambda_n}{f_k } i \\gamma_5 u_n(p )   \\label{softk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28\\ .",
    "\\label{jn5 - 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq.([softk ] ) in eq.([lambdakn ] ) we have , @xmath29 hence , to estimate @xmath25 , we need to calculate @xmath30 which represents the five - quark component of the nucleon .    to do that , we first construct the sum rule for the nucleon using the following `` old - fashioned '' correlation function , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given in eq.([jn5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this type of `` old - fashioned '' correlation function has been successfully used in projecting out positive and negative parity nucleon  @xcite .",
    "we then divide the imaginary part into two parts for @xmath33 , @xmath34 then the spectral density for the positive and negative parity physical states will be as follows , @xmath35 note that the signs are reversed compared to that of sdo because the nucleon current @xmath32 as given in eq.([jn5 - 2 ] ) has an additional factor of @xmath36 compared to the usual nucleon current .",
    "= 5.1 in    for the nucleon correlation function given in eq.([corr2 ] ) , the respective ope are given by @xmath37 } { 4 ! 5 !",
    "2 ^ 7 \\pi^6 }    + \\frac { q_0^{6 } } { 3 ! 4 ! 2 ^ 9 \\pi^6 } \\left [ 2 \\langle \\bar{s } g \\sigma \\cdot g s \\rangle - \\langle \\bar{d } g \\sigma \\cdot g d \\rangle \\right ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have kept the extra numeric factors in the numerator so that our ope can be directly compared with that of the sdo sum rule . from the comparison , we see that the dimension - even operators have been amplified by the factor 3 or 4 while for the dimension - odd operators ( dimension 3 and 5 ) there are partial cancellations among them .    the spectral density is assumed to have the following form , @xmath38 where the usual duality assumption has been used to represent the higher resonance contribution above the continuum threshold @xmath39 .",
    "we substitute this into the following borel transformed dispersion relation , @xmath40   = 0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and obtain a sum rule for @xmath41 @xmath42 the sum rule for the nucleon mass is obtained by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath43 . using the same qcd parameters as in ref.@xcite , we plot the rhs of eq.([nucsum ] ) and the borel curve for the nucleon mass in fig.[inter ] . as can be seen from the figure in the left panel , the ope with dimension 5 , which contains the quark - gluon mixed condensate , still contributes to the sum rule appreciably .",
    "this feature is similar to the sdo sum rule where the quark - gluon mixed condensate is the main origin for yielding the negative - parity .",
    "however , in our case , we have additionally important contribution from the dimension 6 operator .",
    "because of this , the pentaquark nucleon current does not exclusively couple to a specific parity state but it couples to both parities . in fact , from fig.[inter ] , we obtain a consistent ( positive ) sum rule for @xmath44 and a reasonable mass for the nucleon .",
    "similarly we also obtain consistent results for the negative - parity nucleon @xmath45 from the sum rule for @xmath46 .",
    "= 5.1 in    we now reanalyze the sdo sum rule including the k - n 2hr contribution given by eq.([phen2 ] ) .",
    "the imaginary parts of eq.([phen2 ] ) for the positive and negative parity channels are @xmath47 here we use @xmath48 as determined from the previous section",
    ". then , the sdo sum rule with the explicit contribution from the k - n 2hr contribution subtracted out reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "note , the lhs is positive definite .",
    "the reliable sum rule should have the rhs with the same sign .",
    "the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ fsum ] ) , which includes the ope as well as the k - n 2hr contribution , is plotted in fig.[newoka ] .",
    "we see that for the negative - parity case the rhs is positive agreeing with the sign in the lhs .",
    "but for the positive - parity case , the sign of the rhs does not satisfy the constraint on sign required by the lhs . as can be seen also in the figure ,",
    "the contribution from the 2hr state constitutes less than 10% of the total ope .",
    "hence , the conclusion first given by sdo that the ope is consistent with the existence of a negative parity pentaquark state remains valid .    in summary",
    ", we have reanalyzed the qcd sum rule for @xmath0 with the k - n 2hr contribution being subtracted out .",
    "the strength for the k - n 2hr with the @xmath0 interpolating field has been estimated by the soft - kaon theorem and the resulting nucleon sum rule with five - quark current .",
    "the k - n continuum contribution was found to be less than 10 % and the qcd sum rule for @xmath0 still supports a negative - parity state .",
