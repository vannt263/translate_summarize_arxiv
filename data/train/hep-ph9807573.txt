    "<S> + e - mail : parke@fnal.gov_    0.7 cm    at an @xmath0 collider with center of mass energy from 400 to 1000 gev , top quark  @xcite pair production will be very different than fermion pair production at any previous @xmath0 machine for the following reasons : the photon ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath2-boson and their interference will contribute approximately equally to the production and the top quark pairs will be produced at non - ultra - relativistic speeds . at present and previous @xmath0 colliders fermion </S>",
    "<S> pair production is either in the ultra - relativistic regime ( lep , slc and tristan ) and/or completely dominated by the photon contribution ( petra , pep , cesr , spear and cea ) . </S>",
    "<S> this marked difference in the production mechanism leads to significantly different correlations , both angular and in spin , of the top and anti - top quarks compared with any previous fermion pairs produced in @xmath0 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even the spin correlations are measurable for top quark pair production because the top quark decays  @xcite before qcd effects de - correlate its spin and the decay products of a top quark are highly correlated with the direction of its spin _ i.e. the top quark behaves more like a charged lepton than one of the light quarks in this regard . _    the matrix element for @xmath3 is ~e^2 s  |*v*(|e)^ _ l * u*(e )  |*u*(t , s ) _ \\ {  f_ll _ </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath8 s have a very weak s dependence and are given by f_ll= 1.22 - 1.19 f_lr= 0.418 - 0.434 = 0.343 - 0.365 from threshold to ultra - high energies . without the @xmath2-boson couplings , @xmath9 so that the contribution from the @xmath2-boson is constructive for @xmath10 and destructive for @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the fact top quark pairs are non - ultra - relativistic is what makes top pair production different than other examples of fermion pair production .    </S>",

    "<S> what are the directions of the top and anti - top quark spins ? in the rest frame of the top quark there are three natural possibilities for the direction of the top spin ; the electron , the positron or the anti - top quark momentum directions . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold result excludes the anti - top quark momentum direction , which is undefined at threshold , leaving only the electron or positron momentum direction . </S>",

    "<S> the quick answer is that the @xmath29 corrections are dominated by the soft gluon emission diagrams which factorize into an eikonal factor times the tree level result . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there is no spin flip from soft gluon emission and that only hard gluon emission or the @xmath30 anomalous magnetic moment term can change the tree level result . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit calculation  @xcite of the @xmath29 corrections gives the ratio of the dominant top quark spin to the total as = 99.85% at @xmath26 gev . </S>",

    "<S> what is surprising about this is that the charged lepton or d - quark came from the decay of the @xmath35-boson which is less correlated with the spin of the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> this maximal correlation of the charged lepton or d - quark requires a subtle cancelation between the amplitudes involving transverse and longitudinal @xmath35-boson in standard model top quark decay@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> in this paper we have shown that top quark pair production at an  collider is very different than fermion pair production at current and past  machines . at a polarized  collider the top quark pairs are produced in an essentially unique spin configuration . in this configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the top - quark spin is strongly correlated with the positron spin direction determined in the top - quark rest - frame . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent electroweak decays of the top - quark pair give decay products whose angular distributions are highly correlated with the parent top - quark spin . </S>",
    "<S> top - quark pair events thus have a distinctive topology . </S>",
    "<S> this topology is sensitive to the top - quark couplings to the @xmath2-boson and to the photon , which determine the orientation and the size of the top - quark and top anti - quark polarizations , as well as to the top - quark couplings to the @xmath35 and the @xmath39-quark , which determine its decay distributions . </S>",
    "<S> angular correlations in top - quark events may therefore be used to constrain deviations from the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the interference between the _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35-bosons has a significant impact on the angular distribution of the top - quark decay products , and thus will provide additional means for testing the standard model predictions for top - quark decays . </S>"
