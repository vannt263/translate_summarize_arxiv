    "<S> at hera heavy quarks may contribute up to @xmath0 of the structure function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of heavy quarks requires an extension of the dglap formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of using different heavy flavour number schemes , and different approaches to the running of @xmath2 , are compared using the zeus pdf fit formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of including charm data in the fit is explored , using @xmath3 double differential cross - sections rather than the inclusive quantity @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> parton density function ( pdf ) determinations are usually global fits  @xcite , which use inclusive cross - section data and structure function measurements from deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering ( dis ) data as well as some other exclusive cross - ections . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of lepton hadron scattering is described in terms of the variables @xmath5 , the invariant mass of the exchanged vector boson , bjorken @xmath6 , the fraction of the momentum of the incoming nucleon taken by the struck quark ( in the quark - parton model ) , and @xmath7 which measures the energy transfer between the lepton and hadron systems . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross - section for the neutral current ( nc ) process is given in terms of the structure functions by @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in the hera kinematic range there is a sizeable contribution to the @xmath1 structure function from heavy quarks , particularly charm . </S>",
    "<S> thus heavy quarks must be properly treated in the fomalism . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore fitting data on charm production may help to give constraints on the gluon pdf at low-@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most frequent approaches to the inclusion of heavy quarks within the conventional framework of qcd evolution using the dglap equations  @xcite are  :    * zm - vfn ( zero - mass variable flavour number schemes ) in which the charm parton density @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the splitting functions and @xmath14 function . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold @xmath15 , which is in the range @xmath16 , is chosen so that @xmath17 gives a satisfactory description of the data . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this approach is that the simplicity of the massless dglap equations is retained . </S>",
    "<S> the disadvantage is that the physical threshold @xmath18 is not treated correctly ( @xmath19 is the @xmath20 cm energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> * ffn ( fixed flavour number schemes ) in which there is no charm parton density and all charmed quarks are generated by the bgf process . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the ffns scheme is that the threshold region is correctly handled , but the disadvantge is that large @xmath21 terms appear and charm has to be treated ab initio in each hard process . * </S>",
    "<S> gm - vfn ( general mass variable flavour number schemes ) , which aim to treat the threshold correctly and absorb @xmath21 terms into a charm parton density at large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> there are differing versions of such schemes  @xcite    for the main zeus - s analysis  @xcite , the heavy quark production scheme used was the general mass variable flavour number scheme of roberts and thorne ( tr - vfn )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we also investigated the use of the ffn for 3-flavours and the zm - vfn . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schemes ] we compare the fit prediction for @xmath4 using each of these schemes to data on @xmath4 from the zeus collaboration  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see the differences between the ffn and the zm - vfn at threshold where the zm - vfn is clearly inadequate . in this kinematic region </S>",
    "<S> the tr - vfn is more like the ffn . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tr - vfn scheme becomes more like the zm - vfn scheme for @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> this comparison illustrates the effect of change in scheme when keeping the pdf parameters fixed . in practice </S>",
    "<S> one should refit the pdf parameters using the alternative schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this is shown in fig  [ fig : fitschemes ] . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the ffn and tr - vfn is not so marked .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that these choices have some effect on the steepness of the gluon at very small-@xmath6 , such that the zero - mass choice produces a slightly less steep gluon . in fig  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : glusea_schemes ] the differing shapes of the sea and the gluon pdfs for these different heavy quark schemes are illustrated .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : recentcharm ] shows the zeus - s fit predictions for more recent @xmath4 data from zeus and h1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme chosen was ffn for 3 flavours with the renormalisation and factorisation scale for light quarks both set to @xmath5 but the factorisation scale for heavy quarks set to @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for these choices of scheme and scale is that these are the choices made in the programme hvqdis  @xcite which was used to extract @xmath4 from data on @xmath3 production . </S>",
    "<S> the scale choice does not make any signficant difference to the predictions ( see later ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note that in fig  [ fig : recentcharm ] the charm data are shown compared to the zeus - s pdf fit predictions but these data were not input to the fit . </S>",
    "<S> including the zeus charm data  @xcite in the zeus - s pdf fit gives no visible improvement to pdf uncertainties . to investigate the potential of charm data to constrain the gluon pdf , we modified the zeus - s pdf fit as follows : all zeus inclusive neutral current and charged current cross - section data from hera - i was included but no fixed target data ; the parametrisation was modified to free the mid-@xmath6 gluon parameter @xmath24 and the low-@xmath6 valence parameter @xmath25 , however the @xmath26 normalisation had to be fixed since there is no information on this without fixed taregt data </S>",
    "<S> this fit is called the zeus - o fit . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f2charm ] compares the gluon pdf and its uncertainties as extracted from this zeus - o pdf fit with the those extracted from a similar fit including the @xmath4 data .    </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates that the charm data has the potential to constrain the gluon pdf uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> its lack of impact on the global fit may be because we are not using the charm data optimally .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is a quantity extracted from @xmath3 cross - sections by quite a large extrapolation </S>",
    "<S> . it would be better to fit to those cross - sections directly . </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of the theoretical predictions involves running the nlo programme hvqdis for each iteration of the fit . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can shorten this process by using the same method as was used for the zeus - jets fit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pdf independent subprocess cross - sections are output onto a grid , such that they can simply be multiplied by the pdfs at each iteration . </S>",
    "<S> the data used are the nine double differential cross - section measurements of @xmath27  @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:9xsecns ]    there are further theoretical considerations to be accounted for when unputting @xmath3 cross - sections , as opposed to and inclusive quantity like @xmath4 , to a pdf fit . since the grids are calculated using hvqdis the fit must use the ffn scheme to be compatible . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can not use zeus high-@xmath5 data , since this scheme is not suitable at high-@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we chose to use the zeus - s global fit , which incuded fixed target data , with a cut - off @xmath28gev@xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has only recently become evident that since we are using the ffn scheme we must also treat the running of @xmath2 differently than in the vfn schemes . in these vfn schemes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is matched at flavour threholds  @xcite , but the slope of @xmath2 is discontinuous at the flavour thresholds . for consistency with hvqdis we must use a 3-flavour @xmath30 which is continuous in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this requires an equivalent value of @xmath31 in order to be consistent , at low @xmath5 , with the results of using a value of @xmath32 in the usual vfn schemes . </S>",
    "<S> such a 3-flavour @xmath30 has also been used in specialised pdf fits of mrst ( mrst2004f3 )  @xcite , which are used to make predictions for charm production .    in fig  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f2calphas ] we compare different heavy quark factorisation scales and different treatments of the running of @xmath2 for predictions of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f2balphas ] makes the same comparision for @xmath33     . </S>",
    "<S> we see that within the ffn scheme the choice of the heavy quark factorisation scale makes only a small difference at low @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of @xmath30 gives larger differences . </S>",
    "<S> the ffn scheme and tr - vfn scheme differ for almost all @xmath5 if @xmath30 runs as for the vfn schemes . </S>",
    "<S> however if a 3-flavour @xmath30 is applied in the ffn schemes there is much better agreement of all schemes at higher @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to consider inputting the @xmath3 cross - sections to the pdf fit . </S>",
    "<S> the zeus - s global fit formalism is used including all zeus inclusive neutral and charged current cross - section data from hera - i and the fixed target data . </S>",
    "<S> the parametrisation was also modified to free the mid-@xmath6 gluon parameter @xmath24 and the low-@xmath6 valence parameter @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this fit is called zeus - s-13 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gluonffnzs13 ] shows the difference in the gluon pdf uncertainties , before and afer the @xmath3 cross - sections were input to the zeus - s-13 global fit .    </S>",
    "<S> disappointingly the uncertainty on the gluon is not much improved .    </S>",
    "<S> should we have expected much improvement ? </S>",
    "<S> there are two aspects of the fit which could be improved . </S>",
    "<S> the predictiond for the @xmath3 cross - sections have more uncertainties than just the pdf parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> a further uncertainty is introduced in the choice of the @xmath34 fragmentation the petersen fragmentation function was used for the fit predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , looking back at fig  [ fig:9xsecns ] we can see that the lund fragmentation function seems to describe the data better . </S>",
    "<S> to best exploit the charm data in future we need to address such aspects of our model uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , fig  [ fig : d*errors ] compares the fractional errors on the @xmath3 cross - sections with the uncertainty on the prediction for these quantities derived from the uncertainty on the gluon pdf in the zeus - s-13 pdf fit , before inputting the @xmath3 cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> the data errors are larger than the present level of uncertainty . thus we eagerly await the 5-fold increase in statistics expected from hera - ii charm and beauty data . </S>"
