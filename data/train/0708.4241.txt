    "little higgs models  @xcite provide a solution to the hierarchy problem , as they stabilize the higgs boson against quadratic divergences at the one - loop level by the mechanism of collective symmetry breaking : the higgs is charged under two global symmetry groups , which both need to be broken in order to lift the flat direction in the potential of the higgs boson and make it a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) . during the last years",
    "a bewilderment of different models has been developed .",
    "l0.5        these models can be classified in three different categories , the so - called moose models with a moose diagram structure of links of global and local symmetry groups , the product - group models and the simple - group models . in the product - group models",
    "( the most - studied case is the littlest higgs ) the electroweak gauge group is doubled , broken down to the group @xmath0 , while the higgs shares together with the other pngbs an irreducible representation of the coset space of the global symmetry breaking . on the other hand , in simple - group models the electroweak gauge group is enlarged to a simple @xmath1 group , while the higgs is distributed over several multiplets of the global symmetry group , which usually has a product group structure similar to chiral symmetries in qcd  @xcite . for an overview , see  @xcite .",
    "the two crucial scales in the little higgs set - up are the cut - off scale @xmath2 where the models are embedded in a uv - complete theory ( usually a strongly - interacting theory with a partonic substructure of the pngbs ) and the intermediate scale @xmath3 which determines the masses and decay constants of the pngbs ( except for the higgs which is down at @xmath4 by the collective symmetry breaking mechanism ) .",
    "electroweak precision observables and direct search limits  @xcite tell us that the scale @xmath3 must be at least of the order of @xmath5 tev .",
    "paradoxically , the higgs boson in little higgs models tends to be quite heavy compared to the standard model or the mssm , of the order of @xmath6 gev  @xcite . for little higgs model scales that high most new particles will be produced close to the kinematical limit at the lhc , such that a precision determination of their parameters might be difficult .",
    "furthermore , also the sensitivity of the ilc in indirect measurements might be limited , if the new phyics does couple to sm fermions only very weakly  @xcite .",
    "a method to distinguish between different models , especially at the lhc , is highly welcome .",
    "such a method will be presented here .",
    "little higgs models generally have a huge global symmetry group , which contains not only products of simple groups but also a certain number of @xmath7 factors .",
    "these abelian groups can either be gauged , in which case they lead to a @xmath8 boson , or they are only ( approximate ) global symmetries . in the latter case there is a pseudo - goldstone boson attached to that spontaneously broken global @xmath7 factor  @xcite .",
    "the number of pseudoaxions in a given model is determined by the mismatch between the rank reduction in the global and the local symmetry group , since it gives the number of uneaten bosons . in the littlest higgs , e.g. ,",
    "there is one such pseudoaxion , in the simplest little higgs  @xcite there is one , in the original simple group model there are two , in the minimal moose model there are four , and so on .",
    "these particles are electroweak singlets , hence all couplings to sm particles are suppressed by the ratio of the electroweak over the little higgs scale , @xmath9 .",
    "there mass lies in the range from several gev to a few hundred gev , being limited by a naturalness argument and the stability of the coleman - weinberg potential . for the simplest little higgs , on whose phenomenology we will concentrate here ,",
    "there is a seesaw between the higgs and the pseudoscalar mass  @xcite , determined by the explicit symmetry breaking parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . since the pseudoaxions inherit the yukawa coupling     with final state @xmath12 , right intermediate mass with final state @xmath13 .",
    "the dotted line is without the @xmath14 interference , the dashed one the sm background.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with final state @xmath12 , right intermediate mass with final state @xmath13 .",
    "the dotted line is without the @xmath14 interference , the dashed one the sm background.,title=\"fig : \" ]    structure from the higgs bosons , they decay predominantly to the heaviest available fermions in the sm , and because of the absence of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes , the anomaly - induced decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sizable over a wide mass range , cf .",
    "[ fig : etabr ] . from this",
    ", one can see that as soon as the decay to @xmath19 is kinematically allowed , it dominates completely .",
    "such a @xmath20 coupling , which is possible only after electroweak symmetry breaking and hence proportional to @xmath9 , is only allowed in simple group models and is forbidden to all orders in product group models .",
    "one can factor out the @xmath21 group from the matrix of pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "we use @xmath22 $ ] for the pseudo - axion field and @xmath23 $ ] for the non - linear representation of the remaining goldstone multiplet @xmath24 of higgs and other heavy scalars .",
    "then , for product group models , the kinetic term may be expanded as @xmath25    & = \\ldots - 2f(\\partial_\\mu \\eta)\\ ,    \\text{im } \\text{tr } \\left [   ( d^\\mu \\sigma)^\\dagger \\sigma \\right ]    + o(\\eta^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we write only the term with one derivative acting on @xmath26 and one derivative acting on @xmath27 .",
    "this term , if nonzero , is the only one that can yield a @xmath28 coupling .",
    "we now use the special structure of the covariant derivatives in product group models , which is the key to the little higgs mechanism : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the generators of the two independent @xmath31 groups , and @xmath32 + heavy fields . neglecting the heavy gauge fields and extracting the electroweak gauge bosons",
    ", we have @xmath33 \\sim w_\\mu^a \\text{tr } \\left [ ( t_1^a + t_2^a ) + ( t_1^a + t_2^a)^ * \\right ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "this vanishes due to the zero trace of @xmath31 generators .",
    "the same is true when we include additional @xmath7 gauge group generators such as hypercharge , since their embedding in the global simple group forces them to be traceless as well .",
    "we conclude that the coefficient of the @xmath28 coupling vanishes to all orders in the @xmath34 expansion .",
    "next , we consider the simple group models , where we use the following notation for the nonlinear sigma fields : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 is the vev directing in the @xmath38 direction for an @xmath1 simple gauge group extension of the weak group . thus , in simple group models the result is the @xmath39 component of a matrix : @xmath40 we separate the last row and column in the matrix representations of the goldstone fields @xmath27 and gauge boson fields @xmath41 : the higgs boson in simple group models sits in the off - diagonal entries of @xmath27 , while the electroweak gauge bosons reside in the upper left corner of @xmath41 . with the baker - campbell - hausdorff identity",
    ", one gets for the term in parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ kin : simplegroup ] ) : @xmath42 the @xmath39 entry can only be nonzero from the third term on . the first term , would be a mixing between the @xmath43 and the goldstone boson(s ) for the @xmath8 state(s ) and cancels with the help of the many - multiplet structure .",
    "if the @xmath39 component of the second term were nonzero , it would induce a @xmath28 coupling without insertion of a factor @xmath4 .",
    "this is forbidden by electroweak symmetry . to see this",
    ", it is important to note that in simple group models the embedding of the standard model gauge group always works in such a way that hypercharge is a linear combination of the @xmath44 and @xmath7 generators .",
    "this has the effect of canceling the @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the diagonal elements beyond the first two positions , and preventing the diagonal part of @xmath47 from being proportional to @xmath48 . the third term in the expansion yields a contribution to the @xmath28 coupling , @xmath49 .",
    "r.5        the crucial observation is that the matrix - representation embedding of the two non - abelian @xmath31 gauge groups , and especially of the two @xmath7 factors within the irreducible multiplet of the pseudo - goldstone bosons of one simple group ( e.g. @xmath50 in the littlest higgs ) , is responsible for the non - existence of this coupling in product group models .",
    "it is exactly the mechanism which cancels the quadratic one - loop divergences between the electroweak and heavy @xmath31 gauge bosons which cancels this coupling . in simple group models the higgs mass term cancellation",
    "is taken over by enlarging @xmath31 to @xmath1 , and the enlarged non - abelian rank structure cancels the quadratic divergences in the gauge sector  but no longer forbids the @xmath28 coupling .",
    "hence , its serves as a discriminator between the classes of models .",
    "the pseudoaxion can be discovered at the lhc in gluon fusion and observed in the rare decay mode @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath20 coupling can be observed at the lhc only if either one of the decays @xmath51 or @xmath52 is kinematically allowed .",
    "this leaves large holes in parameter space , which can be covered by a @xmath53 gev ilc , depending on the masses . here , we focus on the discovery potential of the ilc for the pseudoaxions , assuming the presence of the @xmath28 coupling .",
    "we focus on the simplest little higgs with parameters chosen to fulfill the low - energy constraints .",
    "the production happens via an @xmath54-channel @xmath46 exchange , in association with a higgs boson like in a two - higgs - model .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] shows the cross section as a function of @xmath55 for three different values of the @xmath43 mass .",
    "the simulations for the processes discussed here have been performed with the whizard / omega package  @xcite , which is ideally suited for physics beyond the sm  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the higgs properties are already known from lhc , and that the higgs can be reconstructed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbbhjj ] and  [ fig : zhh ] we show the three different possible final states , depending on the dominant branching ratio of the pseudoaxion : for low masses ( up to approx .",
    "150 gev ) this is @xmath56 , in an intermediate range ( between 150 gev and 270 gev ) the @xmath17 ( hence dijet ) mode is largest , while @xmath57 sets in above masses of 270 gev .",
    "the figures show the effect of a destructive @xmath14 interference , which brings cross sections down by a factor of two at the peak , but never endangers visibility .",
    "sm backgrounds are nowhere an issue , from marginal for @xmath58 to negligible in the @xmath12 case .",
    "interesting is the @xmath59 final state which is important for measuring the triple higgs coupling  @xcite . in the sm",
    "the cross section is at the borderline of detectability , but fig .",
    "[ fig : zhh ] shows that rates are larger by factors two to six in the simplest little higgs with the intermediate pseudoaxion . in conclusion",
    ", the ilc provides an ideal environment for discovering pseudoaxions and measuring their properties .",
    "the @xmath28 coupling provides tool for the discrimination between simple and product group models .",
