    "[ intro ]    the remarkable property of critical phenomena is the universal scaling appearing in vast variety of systems ; e.g. , magnets and gases follow simple power laws for the order parameter , specific heat capacity , susceptibility , compressibility , etc . @xcite . in thermodynamic systems ,",
    "phase transitions take place at a critical temperature @xmath2 when the coefficients that characterize the linear response of the system to external perturbations _",
    "diverge_. then long  range order appears , causing a transition to a new phase due to collective behavior of the entire system @xcite .",
    "the condition for nonlinear saturation in the test case of the bump  on  tail instability in plasmas @xcite is @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the linear growth rate of a weakly unstable langmuir wave according to the landau theory @xcite , @xmath5 is the frequency of oscillations for particles trapped by the wave .",
    "these trapped particles generate a long  range order of the wavelength @xmath6 , the saturated amplitude @xmath7 can be considered as the order parameter , and the condition of saturation can be rewritten as a power law , typical for the second - order phase transitions , @xmath8 .",
    "however , unlike thermodynamics this scaling contains the nonthermal control parameter @xmath4 , which is determined by the slope of the distribution function @xmath9 at the phase speed @xmath10 of the perturbation near the electron plasma frequency @xmath11 .",
    "[ for thermodynamic systems like magnets for which the magnetization @xmath12 below the curie point @xmath2 is the order parameter , the scaling is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 at @xmath15 . ]",
    "another difference is the critical exponent itself  relation ( [ scalb ] ) predicts the very unusual exponent @xmath16 ; in contrast , the hydrodynamic hopf bifurcation @xcite , also described by the same scaling between the saturated amplitude and the growth rate , has the mean  field critical exponent @xmath17 .",
    "an analysis @xcite assuming thermalization in a vlasov  poisson plasma or gravitating system leads to a critical exponent @xmath18 , and",
    "the exponent @xmath17 has also been hypothesized for the bump - on - tail instability in @xcite . however , detailed center - manifold analysis , which establishes the normal form for a weakly unstable perturbation in one - component collisionless vlasov - poisson system , confirms @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 is also confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "the striking discrepancy between these exponents can be better understood if we consider the structure of the phase space corresponding to these cases .",
    "the exponents @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite correspond either to saturation of a strongly _ dissipative _ instability or to a thermalized system . in both these cases",
    "the distribution function can be factorized as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 can be assumed to be gaussian , and the system is described by its momenta .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 corresponds to saturation due to nonlinear wave - particle interactions in a weakly unstable _ collisionless _ system , where correlations between coordinates and impulses are not destroyed by dissipative processes , so the description can not be reduced to moments of the distribution .",
    "more formally , a dissipative and/or thermalized system is represented by a _",
    "discrete _ set of momenta of the distribution function @xmath21 , which depend only on the coordinate @xmath22 , but not on the velocity @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the local density , the velocity , and the temperature , respectively .",
    "the evolution is a flow @xmath28 which maps @xmath12 onto itself , @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , in a neighborhood of the threshold @xmath30 the evolution @xmath31 can be reduced to a normal form , which maps only the order parameter , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the set of complex numbers ) , and therefore the evolution is a _ trajectory _ @xmath36 or in other words the set @xmath37 .",
    "the phase space of a one - dimensional collisionless system is a _ continuous _",
    "set @xmath38 and evolution can be represented as the flow @xmath39 .",
    "( for periodic boundary conditions the phase space is isomorphic to a cylinder @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is isomorphic to a circle . )",
    "the sets @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) have different _ dimensionality _ , and therefore renormalization of collisionless system in a vicinity of threshold  i.e. , transformation of the set @xmath43 _ and _ the mapping @xmath45  involves one or more additional dimension .",
    "further it is shown below , that scaling transformations close to the threshold are interrelated with the additional velocity coordinate , which disappears in hydrodynamic description because of integration of the distribution function @xmath21 over @xmath23 .    from the theory of critical phenomena",
    "it is known that dimensionality @xmath46 is inseparable part of the threshold description  along with the critical exponents ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides @xmath47 , other critical exponents : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , describe the following scalings of the ising universality class : ( i ) the specific heat capacity scales as @xmath53 ( ii ) the susceptibility as @xmath54 ( iii ) the response @xmath12 at @xmath55 as @xmath56 ( iv ) the correlation length as @xmath57 and ( v ) the two - point correlation function as @xmath58    these exponents are not independent , but are interrelated via scaling laws , e.g. , the widom equality @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these scaling laws also include _ hyperscaling _ laws such as josephson s law , @xmath60 @xcite which involves the dimensionality @xmath46 along with the exponents .    for thermodynamics the mean",
    " field exponents are of the landau - weiss set , @xmath61 , @xmath17 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , and the scaling laws hold at the formal dimensionality @xmath66 .",
    "however , the possibilities of critical phenomena are not exhausted by the ising universality class  the percolation critical exponents @xcite , which describe another vast class of critical phenomena , are different from those in thermodynamics and scaling laws hold at a different dimensionality . in particular , for the bethe lattice ( or cayley tree ) @xcite josephson s law holds at dimensionality @xmath67 . despite the description being the same",
    ", this difference separates the cases into different _",
    "universality classes _ with different _ upper critical dimensions _ : @xmath68 for the ising universality class @xcite and @xmath67 for percolation .    for a collisionless gravitating system ,",
    "where the saturation mechanism is the same as for the bump - on - tail instability in plasmas , the critical exponent @xmath69 , and the critical exponents @xmath70 , @xmath71 can be determined analogously to thermodynamics and calculated from the response to an external pump @xcite .",
    "these exponents are very different from the thermodynamic set , but nevertheless satisfy the widom equality , thus suggesting the validity of scaling laws .",
    "josephson s law also holds , but at a rather surprising dimensionality which is the fractal one @xmath72 @xcite . at the same time , the processes resulting in @xmath73 differ _ qualitatively _ from those resulting in @xmath16 , similar to thermodynamics where spatial fluctuations of the order parameter , neglected in mean field theories , result in @xmath74 , therefore suggesting other universality classes were not completely ruled out .",
    "these could be the wave - wave interactions , responsible for the strong turbulence in plasma @xcite ) , which are next in dynamical importance and have fewer degrees of freedom @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use numerical simulations to study the threshold scalings in a weakly unstable collisionless vlasov - poisson system . depending on the sign of the poisson equation",
    "this set of equations describes either a plasma system or a gravitating system .",
    "the saturation mechanism in a collisionless gravitating system is the same as for the bump - on - tail instability in plasmas and threshold corresponds to the condition @xmath30 in both cases .",
    "we show in section [ bas_eq ] that the eigenfrequency contains only an imaginary part , and therefore is the simplest model to study the threshold . section [ resls ] describes the results of computations of the critical exponents and demonstrates that the scaling laws describing saturation are the same for plasma and gravitation .",
    "section [ sym_law ] addresses the scaling transformations of the phase space and the scaling law , which appears as a result of this symmetry .",
    "the exponent which describes correlations are obtained in section [ hyp_d ] , where fisher s equality @xmath75 is also proved . in section [ rel_d_uc ]",
    "we show that the criticality in the system is described by the dirac propagator for a fermionic field .",
    "we obtain hyperscaling laws and calculate upper critical dimensionalities in section [ hyp_slaw ] .",
