    "the existence of topologically distinct phases of matter was one of the most profound discoveries of theoretical physics in recent decades.@xcite the idea of classifying bandstructures using topological invariants , such as the chern number,@xcite arose originally in the study of the quantum hall effect,@xcite and subsequently led to the discovery of two- and three - dimensional topologically insulating materials .",
    "it has also inspired numerous proposals and experiments for realizing topologically non - trivial bands using light,@xcite sound,@xcite and other types of waves.@xcite according to the topological bulk - edge correspondence principle,@xcite topologically nontrivial bandstructures imply the existence of topologically - protected edge states , whose unique transport properties may have applications in many fields .    theories of bandstructure topology typically assume that the underlying lattice is hermitian . yet in settings such as topological photonics , non - hermitian effects  in the form of gain and/or loss  are easily introduced , and may be both substantial and unavoidable in practical implementations.@xcite broadly speaking , non - hermiticity poses two problems for standard theories .",
    "firstly , non - hermitian bands can exhibit exceptional points ( eps),@xcite in which case bands cease to be continuously single - valued throughout @xmath0-space , which is conceptually troublesome for band invariants such as chern numbers .",
    "secondly , standard formulations of the bulk - edge correspondence principle rely on the existence of a real spectral gap in the bulk .",
    "for instance , in hatsugai s well - known derivation of the correspondence between quantum hall edge states and chern numbers , it is crucial to assume that a lattice in a strip geometry has a _ real _ point spectrum which converges , in the large - system limit , to an integer number of real bands.@xcite    a number of recent works@xcite have started to explore how band topological ideas might be extended to non - hermitian systems .",
    "notably , certain special one- and two - dimensional non - hermitian lattices have been found to exhibit topological invariants with meaningful bulk - edge correspondences.@xcite some of these novel invariants are based on the integral winding numbers associated with eps of the complex band spectrum ( i.e. , branch point orders ) , which constitute a natural class of discrete features tied to non - hermiticity . so far , however , it has been unclear whether there is a connection between invariants based on ep winding numbers and the standard topological invariants previously developed for hermitian systems .",
    "this paper demonstrates , theoretically and experimentally , a relationship between a previously - known hermitian topological invariant and ep winding numbers .",
    "the topological invariant comes from a _",
    "topological pump_,@xcite in the form of the winding numbers of scattering matrix eigenvalues during a parametric pumping cycle.@xcite in a hermitian lattice , the bulk - edge correspondence principle associates a zero ( nonzero ) winding number with a topologically trivial ( nontrivial ) bulk bandgap . strictly speaking",
    ", however , topologically nontrivial behavior emerges only in the @xmath1 limit , where @xmath2 is the sample width ( i.e. , the limit where opposite edges of the sample are decoupled ) .",
    "we show that when the topological pump is continued into the non - hermitian case , e.g.  by applying both gain and loss , topologically nontrivial behavior can arise under the generalized condition @xmath3 where @xmath4 parameterizes the non - hermiticity ( gain / loss ) in each unit cell . in the hermitian case ( @xmath5 ) ,",

    ", nonzero windings can occur for finite @xmath2 , and we show that these emerge out of the winding numbers of a pair of eps of the non - unitary scattering matrix .",
    "the above ideas are realized and confirmed in an experiment on a classical electromagnetic network in a topological pumping configuration,@xcite operating in the microwave frequency range ( 900 mhz ) .",
    "previously , we have shown that such a network , constructed from radio frequency ( rf ) cables , couplers , and phase shifters , can be used to implement a topological pump.@xcite the windings of the scattering matrix eigenvalues , during a pumping cycle , were found to match the underlying bandstructure of the network , which could be topologically trivial or nontrivial . in that experiment , the intrinsic losses were fixed.@xcite here , we incorporate _",
    "tunable _ amplifiers that can be used to control the level of non - hermiticity .",
    "this allows us to probe for the theoretically - predicted eps , and study their effects on the topological pump .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of non - hermiticity on topological pumping , and uncover a connection between a topological edge invariant based on topological pumping and the winding numbers of exceptional points . in hermitian lattices , it is known that the topologically nontrivial regime of the topological pump only arises in the infinite - system limit . in finite non - hermitian lattices , however , topologically nontrivial behavior can also appear . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can be understood in terms of the effects of encircling a pair of exceptional points during a pumping cycle . </S>",
