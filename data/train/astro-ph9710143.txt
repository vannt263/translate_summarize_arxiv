    "the detectability of oh megamaser and gigamaser galaxies at cosmological distances has been noted by several authors ( baan 1989 , baan et al 1992a , norman & braun 1996 , baan 1997 ) .",
    "so far , the sample of known megamasers has been assembled from targeted observations of luminous galaxies for which redshifts are known ( cf .",
    "baan et al 1992b , martin et al 1989 , stavely - smith et al 1992 ) .",
    "the receiving systems are tuned to the predicted frequencies of the redshifted oh lines whose rest frequencies fall at 1665 and 1667 mhz .",
    "the greatest success rate for discovery of megamasers occurs in galaxy samples that are selected for having the highest far infrared ( fir ) 60  @xmath8 luminosity , with the result that @xmath9% of galaxies with @xmath10 are strong oh masers ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the odds decline to @xmath12% for samples where @xmath13 .",
    "there is a striking correlation between oh luminosity @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ( baan et al 1992a , baan 1989 , martin et al 1989 ) .    a picture explaining both the probability of detection and the relative strengths of megamaser emission from objects of different @xmath15 has the maser strength depending on strength of the starburst activity in the galaxy ( baan 1989 , henkel et al 1991 ) .",
    "major merger and interaction events are the strongest stimulants of star formation and also produce the most turbulent interstellar gas distributions ; these conditions provide the strongest ir fluxes for pumping the maser levels , as well as the largest covering factors of the star forming regions , leading to the greatest probability that views from random directions will see oh maser activity .",
    "galaxies with milder star formation have more placid disks , and maser emission is then observed only by observers who view the galaxies nearly edge - on to their planes .",
    "the strong association between the ultra - luminous fir galaxies and strongly - interacting and merging systems has been recently discussed by clements et al ( 1996 ) .    at the present epoch ,",
    "the superluminous fir galaxies that host the most luminous masers are relatively rare galaxies .",
    "this means that radio spectroscopic surveys of the sky would need to cover large solid angles before they would begin to detect oh masers at random from the local galaxy population . on the other hand",
    ", this paper will show that , since oh emission can be so very strong , it becomes probable that surveys with large spectral bandwidths and covering large depths are likely to identify cosmologically distant megamasers with moderate integration times .",
    "the most luminous infrared sources known are the objects detected at high redshifts , @xmath17 to 4.7 , ( rowan - robinson 1996 , and references therein ) with @xmath18 to 10@xmath19 .",
    "there is general consensus that the merging and interaction rate of galaxies was greater in the past with merging rate rising in proportion to @xmath20 .",
    "values for @xmath21 as high as 4 ( carlberg 1992 , lavery et al 1996 ) are mentioned in the literature , although there is some observational evidence pointing to @xmath22 for @xmath23 in the hst medium deep survey ( neuschaefer et al 1997 ) and @xmath24 from faint galaxy catalogs compiled from cfht surveys ( patton et al 1997 ) .",
    "the comoving number density of bright qsos ( @xmath25 @xmath26 ) increases as @xmath27 from @xmath28 to 2 ( hewett et al 1993 ) , and , if the qso phenomenon is tied to galaxy interactions , this steep evolution could point to a steep rise in the interaction rate .    surveys in the range 400 to 1000 mhz may provide an independent measure of the merging rate by determining the density of merging galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "since some of the currently most viable models of galaxy formation require the bulk of the construction of the larger galaxies to occur by merging throughout this range of redshift ( @xmath29 to 3 ) , surveys for oh masers will form an important test of the principal processes of galaxy formation .",
    "the detection rate for oh megamasers can be estimated by combining 1 ) knowledge of the density of prospective fir luminous host galaxies , 2 ) the probability that galaxies of each luminosity will be seen as megamaser emitters , 3 ) the dependence of megamaser strength on fir luminosity , and 4 ) the sensitivity of radio telescope receiving systems .",
    "the steps in the estimation of the detection rate are outlined in the following subsections",
    ". a parallel line of reasoning applies to the detectability of normal galaxies in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen , as discussed in sect .",
    "koranyi & strauss ( 1997 ) have presented a conveniently formulated description of the far - infraed luminosity function , based on complete samples of galaxies from the iras 60  @xmath31 m survey .",
    "their paper analyzes the sample in the context of several cosmological models ; here , parameters for the `` @xmath32 '' case , which is the conventional cosmology , are adopted to describe the number density of luminous , fir - selected galaxies .    the 60  @xmath31 m differential luminosity function is given by    @xmath33    with @xmath34 , the cumulative luminosity function , defined as @xmath35 for the case of conventional cosmology , koranyi & strauss fit values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the normalization constant , @xmath39 , is related to their parameter @xmath40  mpc@xmath41 , through the relation @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the minimum luminosity detectable in the sample , whose members are restricted to lie at redshifts greater than @xmath44 . for koranyi & strauss analysis , @xmath45 , which leads to @xmath46 mpc@xmath41 ( @xmath47  km  s@xmath48  mpc@xmath48 ) .    in the @xmath49 regime , which will characterize the hosts of the brightest oh line emitters ,",
    "@xmath50 may be approximated as @xmath51      the strong correlation between oh and 60@xmath31 m luminosity , @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "baan et al , 1992a ) provides a way to recast the 60@xmath31 m luminosity function for luminous fir galaxies to obtain an oh megamaser luminosity function @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ ohlumfnct.fig ] . in this paper , this has been accomplished in two complementary ways : one by numerical integration of @xmath50 to obtain the number of oh sources falling in logarithmically spaced bins of @xmath14 , and the second by noting that the masers that are detectable at cosmological distances inhabit host galaxies that are far more luminous than @xmath54 and then using the approximation in eq.([phiapprox.eq ] ) to derive an analytic expression .",
    "the advantages of computing @xmath52 numerically are that it ( 1 ) simplifies inclusion of the spread of oh luminosities in a band of width @xmath55 about the @xmath53 relation ( baan et al 1992a ) , and ( 2 ) allows for varying the probability @xmath56 that luminous fir galaxies will appear to be megamasers as a function of @xmath57 . here , the range of fir luminosities that are considered to contribute oh megamasers is conservatively restricted to the range where strong oh emission has actually been detected ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 of baan et al 1992a ) ; adopting @xmath58  km  s@xmath48mpc@xmath48 , this range is @xmath59 .",
    "within this range , @xmath56 takes on non - zero values as follows , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( from baan 1989 , baan et al 1992b ) .",
    "since these probabilities are likely to be a result of viewing angle , the derived luminosity function should be considered as an `` effective oh luminosity function '' that provides the probability of detection for randomly oriented sources , rather than an an accurate accounting of the number of oh emitting galaxies .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath66 in @xmath67 is @xmath68 , and a fiducial @xmath69 can be defined to be @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ ohlumfnct.fig ] shows the numerically computed luminosity function for oh megamasers in logarithmically spaced bins of 0.1 dex . for reference ,",
    "the 60  @xmath31 m luminosity ( @xmath71 ) is indicated on the top axis .",
    "since the bright oh megamasers that are likely to be useful in cosmological studies lie well above @xmath69 , the approximation in eq.([phiapprox.eq ] ) can be used to verify the numerical estimate in the range of greatest interest : @xmath72\\left(\\frac{dl_{60}}{dl_{oh}}\\right)dl_{oh } \\\\   & = & cf_{m}\\frac{(\\alpha+\\beta)}{2 }    \\left(\\frac{l_{oh}}{l^*_{oh}}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta+2}{2 } }     \\frac{dl_{oh}}{l^*_{oh } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since it is convenient to plot the number of objects per logarithmically spaced bins of luminosity , the number of objects falling in bins of @xmath73 dex centered on @xmath14 can be obtained from @xmath74 this function , with @xmath56 set equal to 1 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ohlumfnct.fig ] for comparison with the result of the numerical integration .    in a related analysis ,",
    "baan ( 1997 ) presents the 60@xmath75 fir luminosity function for oh megamaser sources as a function of @xmath15 for direct comparison with the luminosity function for broader population of all fir galaxies .",
    "baan ( 1997 ) further bins the fraction @xmath56 in 0.5 dex rather than the 1  dex divisions used in the approximation here .",
    "the finer binning would lead to less abrupt inflections in the oh luminosity function derived here ( cf . fig .",
    "[ ohlumfnct.fig ] ) .",
    "overall , there is good agreement between the spatial densities of galaxies between baan ( 1997 ) and the present work , although the fraction of oh galaxies showing megamaser emission presented by baan ( 1997 ) appears to be roughly a factor of two lower in each luminosity range than in the earlier publications .",
    "this factor of two uncertainty can be propagated through the subsequent estimates for volume densities and densities per solid angle .",
    "the integral line flux observed from a cosmologically distant emitter at redshift @xmath76 is ( wieringa et al 1992 ) @xmath77 ^ 2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the luminosity distance , @xmath79 is the hubble constant and @xmath80 is the cosmological mass density normalized to the critical density .",
    "if the line of width @xmath81  km  s@xmath48 is emitted at rest frequency @xmath82 and redshifted to @xmath83 , the observed frequency width of the line will be @xmath84 , providing an average flux density over the line profile of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the line width is squeezed in frequency as a line of velocity width @xmath81 is observed toward higher redshifts , leading to a partial compensation for the reduction in the integral line flux by the inverse square law ( eq.([cosmflux.eqn ] ) ) , the range of line widths observed for oh megamaser galaxies is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ velwid.fig ] , where the line width is plotted as a function of maser luminosity .",
    "the vast majority of the line profiles fall in the range 30 to 300 km  s@xmath48 .",
    "only the most luminous source known shows a much broader profile ( baan et al , 1992a ) .    the sensitivity of a radio telescope is generally specified ( cf .",

    "the noise level attained by observing a single polarization with a spectral resolution of @xmath93 and an integration time @xmath94 is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a factor with values typically between 1 and 1.4 depending on the details of the digital correlation spectrometer used to obtain the spectra .    as an example of sensitivities that can be attained at present or in the near future ,",
    "consider the specifications and noise levels for typical observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "for this system , receivers at 600 and 1400 mhz will have @xmath86 of 45 and 25  k respectively .",

    "[ cosmcompare.fig ] and [ ratecombo.fig ] for comparison with the oh line strengths .",
    "the exponential cutoff to the hi luminosity function causes the hi detection rate to cutoff very hard around @xmath110 for 1  mjy sensitivity .",
    "the power law function for the oh masers permits the bright end of the oh maser population to dominate the detection rate at frequencies below @xmath1111200 mhz for reasonable integration times with existing telescopes .    not only are the typical velocity widths of the oh profiles comparable to velocity spreads measured in the 21 cm line for low mass and face - on galaxies , but also the pair of strong oh lines at 1665.4 and 1667.4 mhz could produce a spectrum that , at low signal to noise ratio , could imitate a double horned galaxy profile with a splitting of @xmath111360 km  s@xmath48 , although the horns are likely to be asymmetric due to the usual weakness of the 1665 line relative to the 1667 line .",
    "sifting the oh masers from the hi lines from normal galaxies of low redshift would be straightforward .",

    "since the infrared spectrum of the oh megamasers falls steeply from 60  @xmath31 m to 25  @xmath31 m , suitable megamaser host galaxies at moderate to high redshift may become increasingly difficult to detect at infrared wavelengths as the 60  @xmath31 m flux is redshifted toward still longer wavelengths .",

    ", it is demonstrated that surveys sensitive to oh masers at @xmath113 may be able to measure the number density of interacting and merging systems at high redshift at a time when the merging rate is thought to peak .",
    "observations using radio telescopes with sufficient sensitivity and sufficient spectral bandwidth can not only determine the statistics of the evolving density of oh masers with time , but they will also select systems of interest at high redshift , which can be further studied with a variety of techniques to determine physical conditions , dynamics and effects of local environment .    for the purposes of estimating the effect of an increased merging rate at early times , the model explored in fig .",

    "[ ratecombo.fig ] can be modified by increasing the number density of oh megamasers in proportion to @xmath20 , in keeping with the idea that , locally , oh megamasers are associated with luminous fir galaxies , which in turn are found to occur in systems with merging and interacting morphologies ( clements et al 1996 ) . for comparison , an extreme example , @xmath114 ( lavery et al 1996 ) is shown in fig .",

    "the luminous quasar population shows a still stronger evolution than is typically suggested for normal galaxies .",
