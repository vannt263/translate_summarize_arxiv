    "the past year has seen the first meaningful attempts to determine the global star - formation history of the universe , using the combined leverage provided by deep redshift surveys ( _ e.g. _ the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs ) ; lilly _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) reaching @xmath8 , and the detection / non - detection of lyman limit galaxies at higher redshifts ( in , for example , the hubble deep field ; madau _ et al .",
    "the results ( _ e.g. _ madau 1997 ) indicate that star - formation rate ( and metal production ) is @xmath9 times greater at @xmath8 than in the local universe , peaks somewhere around @xmath10 , and declines to values comparable with the present day at @xmath11 .",
    "the impact of dust obscuration on this result has yet to be fully assessed ( pettini , priv .",
    "comm . ) , as has the effect of combining samples selected in rather different ways . however , amid the excitement caused by this revolution in optical cosmology , it seems to have been forgotten that there already exists a class of source the evolution of which has been well studied out to @xmath6 , is derived from well - defined complete samples , and is immune from the effects of dust .",
    "since the benefits of studying cosmological evolution at radio wavelengths are so clear , an outsider might reasonably ask why so much effort has recently been directed at determining the cosmological evolution of ultraviolet light in our universe .",
    "the answer , of course , is a general ( and not unreasonable ) disbelief that the evolution of these rare and bizarre fireworks  powerful radio galaxies  can tell us much ( or indeed anything ) about the evolution of the ` normal ' galaxies of stars .",
    "however , in recent years it has become clear that the level and form of evolution displayed by powerful radio sources is not unique to either this particular class of active galaxy or to the radio waveband . as has been discussed elsewhere ( _ e.g. _ dunlop 1994 ) at least out to @xmath12 very similar evolution",
    "is found at optical wavelengths for optically - selected qsos ( hewett _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) and at x - ray wavelengths for x - ray selected quasars ( boyle _ et al .",
    "more intriguing still , however , is the suggestion that the starburst galaxy population discovered by iras also displays similar evolution ( rowan - robinson _",
    "1993 ) , at least at low @xmath13 .",
    "this last comparison suggests that the form of evolution displayed by radio sources , as well as being applicable to agn in general , might be of even wider relevance . in this brief article",
    "i have therefore explored the possibility that this evolution is truly universal , by comparing the evolving radio luminosity density from powerful radio sources with recent estimates of the star - formation history of the universe .",
    "first , however , i reassess our current knowledge of the high - redshift evolution of radio sources by comparing the predictions of the alternative high - redshift ` cutoff ' models of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) with the actual redshift distributions of two new complete samples ; a ` bright ' ( 2 jy ) sample with complete redshift coverage , and the first ` faint ' sample ( 1 mjy ) with spectroscopic redshifts or ` reliable ' estimates for all sources .",
    "the advantages of completeness and immunity to dust offered by radio selection can only be realised with reliable redshift information , which is hardest to achieve at high redshift .      out to redshifts @xmath12 the evolution of powerful ( @xmath14 ) radio sources is reasonably well - constrained , and in 1990 john peacock and i showed that , given the existing complete - sample database , the evolution of both the flat - spectrum ( @xmath15 where @xmath16 ) and steep - spectrum ( @xmath17 ) radio - source populations is at least consistent with pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) with @xmath18 ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "the key component of the complete - sample database used by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) to constrain the high - redshift evolution of the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) was the parkes selected regions ( psr ) , a sample of 178 sources with @xmath19 mjy over an area of 0.075 sr . much of the evidence for a high - redshift decline in the steep - spectrum population then depended on @xmath20-band photometry to estimate the redshifts of the faintest galaxies in this sample .",
    "the reliability of this method has since been called into question ( eales _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) although interestingly a renewed spectroscopic campaign on the psr is currently revealing that virtually all the galaxies have true redshifts which are _ smaller _ than their @xmath21 estimates .",
    "the revised redshift distribution for the psr , and its implications for the high - redshift evolution of the rlf will be presented elsewhere . however , a complete redshift distribution has now been obtained for a smaller and brighter complete sub - sample of 65 radio galaxies from the 6c / b2 survey ( eales & rawlings 1996 ) .",
    "below i compare this redshift distribution with the predictions of the redshift cutoff models of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , and then consider the redshift distribution that john peacock and i have recently derived for a much deeper sample from the leiden berkeley deep survey ( lbds ) , a sample of sufficient depth to resolve the issue of the redshift cutoff beyond doubt .",
    "although dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) concluded that the evidence for a high - redshift cutoff in the steep - spectrum luminosity function was strong , uncertainties in redshift estimation , combined with lack of coverage of the luminosity baseline , meant that we were unable to distinguish between universal negative pure luminosity evolution at @xmath22 ( the ple model ) and an alternative model involving continuing positive luminosity evolution combined with negative density evolution at high @xmath13 ( the lde model ) .",
    "these two alternative models are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , the principle difference between them being that in the lde model the strength of the decline in comoving number density is a function of radio power .",
    "the complete 6c / b2 sub - sample consists of 65 sources detected at 151 mhz with @xmath23 in 0.1 sr of sky .",
    "eales , rawlings and collaborators have recently completed the measurement of spectroscopic redshifts for all the sources in this sample ; 11 galaxies lie at @xmath24 ( eales & rawlings 1996 ) and two of these lie at @xmath25 ( 6c 1232@xmath2639;@xmath27 and b2 0902@xmath2634;@xmath28 ) . the cumulative redshift distribution for this sample for @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "2a , where it is compared with the distributions predicted by the ple and lde redshift cutoff models shown in fig . 1 , and also with the prediction of a ` no - cutoff ' model in which the form and normalization of the rlf is frozen for @xmath24 .",
    "the predicted number counts at 151 mhz have been produced from the models ( which are defined at 2.7 ghz ) by using the average spectral index displayed between 151 mhz and 2.7 ghz by the 11 @xmath24 sources in the sample ( @xmath29 ) to convert the 151 mhz flux - density boundaries to their equivalent values at 2.7 ghz .",
    "( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is clear that the redshift distribution of this sample strongly supports the existence of the redshift cutoff , but that the form of this cutoff seems better described by the lde model than the ple model .",
    "i note in passing that the recent discovery of 6c 0140@xmath26326 at @xmath31 in a deeper 6c ( @xmath32 jy ) 0.1 sr sample ( rawlings _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) is also perfectly consistent with the lde model of the high - redshift cutoff ( see dunlop 1996 )      the 6c / b2 sub - sample considered above is of interest because of its complete redshift information rather than because it can really confirm or refute the existence of the redshift cutoff .",
    "indeed it is a factor @xmath33 _ less _ deep than the psr , and thus at @xmath25 can only be used to estimate the comoving space density of objects brighter than @xmath34 ( which are intrinsically very rare ) . to unambiguously confirm or refute the existence of the redshift cutoff really requires the study of a sample which is @xmath35 times fainter , and",
    "is thus capable of sampling the radio luminosity function down to @xmath36 out to @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _ below the break luminosity at all redshifts  see fig .",
    "1 ) .    accordingly , over the last few years we have been attempting to determine the redshift distribution of a statistically complete sample of 77 galaxies with @xmath37 mjy selected from the lbds ( windhorst _ et al .",
    "_ 1984a , 1984b , kron _",
    "et al . _ 1985 ) .",
    "we now possess @xmath38 photometry for the galaxies in this sample enabling us to estimate redshifts both from spectral fitting and from a modified version of the @xmath21 diagram ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "optical spectroscopy of a subset of sources with the keck telescope shows this dual - pronged approach to redshift estimation to be reliable , certainly out to @xmath39 , principally because the starlight from these more moderate - luminosity radio galaxies is less contaminated by strong emission lines or scattered agn light than in the more extreme high-@xmath13 objects found in brighter radio samples ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting redshift distribution of this 1 mjy sample is compared with that predicted by the ple - cutoff , lde - cutoff and no - cutoff models in fig .",
    "2b , where the predicted redshift distributions have been produced assuming @xmath40 .",
    "comparison of the number count predictions in this figure with those in fig .",
    "2a makes clear the enormous power of this much deeper sample , despite the need to resort to redshift estimation .",
    "in fact , to remove the cutoff , 10 of the 77 sources in this sample need to lie at @xmath41 , whereas our best estimate of the redshift distribution follows almost exactly the predictions of the cutoff models .",
    "the combination of the lbds and 6c samples spans sufficient baseline in radio power to allow a first attempt at differentiating between the ple and lde models , and it is clear that fig .",
    "2 favours a luminosity - dependent cutoff which is least drastic for the most luminous sources .",
    "large redshift surveys of bright radio quasars have confirmed that a very similar , perhaps also luminosity - dependent redshift cutoff is displayed by the quasar rlf ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ; shaver _ et al .",
    "futhermore , it is now clear that the population of optically - selected qsos declines at high redshift with , arguably , a comparable luminosity dependence ( warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ; kennefick _ et al .",
    "the implication is that the similarity between the evolving flat - spectrum rlf , steep - spectrum rlf and qso olf seen at @xmath42 extends right out @xmath6 , and that all powerful agn suffer a similar form of decline at @xmath22 .",
    "however , as is often the case in luminosity function studies , focussing on uncertainty in the precise form of the evolving luminosity function can cloud the fact that evolving _ luminosity density _ is rather robustly determined . in fig .",
    "3 i plot the evolving luminosity - weighted integral of the ple and lde rlfs .",
    "both models yield essentially the same evolving luminosity density of radio emission out to @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "3 the evolving luminosity density of radio emission is presented in terms of an evolving black hole fueling rate per mpc@xmath1 ( left - hand axis ; see figure caption for details ) to enable ease of comparison with the evolving star - formation rate per mpc@xmath1 deduced by madau ( 1997 ) ( data points and right - hand axis in fig .",
    "the similarity between the radio - based curves , and the ultraviolet - based data points in fig .",
    "3 appears too good to be a coincidence ; the agreement is essentially perfect out to @xmath8 where the star - formation rate is well determined , and at @xmath44 the curves are undoubtedly consistent with the limits derived from the number density of lyman - limit galaxies .",
    "indeed , given the superior completeness of the radio surveys one might go so far as to suggest that the curves shown in fig .",
    "3 provide the current ` best bet ' as to the true star - formation density between @xmath8 and @xmath43 . to bring the data - points at @xmath45 and @xmath6 into good agreement with the radio - based prediction",
    "requires that the star - formation rate density as currently derived from the lyman - limit galaxies is under - estimated by a factor @xmath46 relative to the star - formation census provided at @xmath47 by the cfrs",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether this transpires to be the case , or whether star - formation activity really does peak at redshifts closer to @xmath8 .    at first sight",
    "it perhaps seems unlikely that cosmic star - formation activity , which at least at @xmath47 occurs predominantly in disc / irregular systems , should be traced by the evolution of powerful radio sources which themselves are generally found in old giant elliptical galaxies ( even at @xmath48 at least some radio galaxies are @xmath49 gyr old ; dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , dunlop 1997 )",
    ". however , star - formation rate density presumably reflects the global rate of gravitational accretion / condensation of gas at a given epoch , and it is at least plausible that when such material falls into a massive galaxy containing a black hole , its mass is partly reprocessed as radio emission rather than simply forming a disc of stars . averaged over a large enough volume , it might not be unreasonable to find that radio luminosity density should reflect the global level of sfr at any given epoch .",
    "it remains to be determined whether the stars in the giant elliptical radio - source hosts are themselves formed in the tail of the distribution illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , or whether there exists a separate high - redshift peak of star - formation corresponding to the ( perhaps dust - enshrouded ) formation epoch of the most massive objects ."
