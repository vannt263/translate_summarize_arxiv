    "it is becoming increasingly clear that the observed field stars are mostly the by - product of the disruption of some type of stellar ensemble ( see e.g. hopkins 2013 ) , bound ( star cluster ) or unbound ( stellar association ) .",
    "the vast majority of clusters or stellar aggregates are not long - term stable and dissociate into individual stars shortly after their formation ( e.g. tutukov 1978 ; de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2004 ; de grijs 2009 ; goodwin 2009 ) ; moreover , the majority of stars appear to form in low density environments associations not dense star clusters ( e.g. fritze 2009 ; bressert et al .",
    "2010 ; gieles and portegies zwart 2011 ) .",
    "the fraction of all stars in the universe once formed in bound star clusters is currently estimated at 3035  % ( kruijssen 2012 ) .",
    "these facts explain why , at any epoch , most stars in a galaxy are not associated to clusters but to the overall field . within galaxies ,",
    "a range of external forces can trigger giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) fragmentation which in turn , leads to stellar association and star cluster formation within star - forming complexes ( see e.g. elmegreen and lada 1977 ; efremov 1978 , 1979 ; elmegreen and efremov 1996 ; efremov and elmegreen 1998 ) . in this context ,",
    "star clusters and associations appear as primary galactic building blocks .",
    "historically , star clusters in the milky way are split up into two distinct , fully independent , seemingly unrelated populations : globular and open clusters . in general terms",
    ", this traditional view appears to be well supported by available observational data : globular and open clusters show significantly different structural and kinematic properties and the two groups seem to be of rather different origin ( see e.g. sparke and gallagher 2007 ) . consistently , it has been customarily assumed that globular and open clusters never interact ; i.e. , there are no connections between the two types of clusters . however , this classical and prevalent interpretation is now open to question , at least partially , because recent evidence appears to indicate that : ( i ) some old open clusters may be linked to accreted globular clusters ( see e.g. carraro and bensby 2009 ) and ( ii ) globular clusters passing through the disk may trigger formation of open clusters ( see e.g. vande putte and cropper 2009 ) .",
    "these certainly are interesting scenarios but the novelty of these ideas also raises questions about their actual feasibility and proper characterization .",
    "for example and based on currently available data , how strong is the statistical evidence for these globular - open cluster connections ? and more importantly , what criteria should be used to define such connections , if real ? in the first case , carraro and bensby ( 2009 ) suggest that globular and open clusters that were accreted together are expected to have similar chemical and kinematic properties ( although the need of a common chemical signature is a debatable point ) . for the second scenario ,",
    "an excess of young open clusters close to a globular cluster may hint at a potential cause - and - effect relationship . in this case , no kinematic link is expected : why should an open cluster formed out of a shocked gmc have a motion similar to that of a globular cluster passing through the galactic disk ?",
    "both , globular cluster and molecular cloud will have their orbits perturbed by the interaction , but not enough to give the newly formed open clusters and their progenitor a common motion .",
    "no chemical connection is expected , either . in this case , only positional evidence in the form of an excess of small pair separations for some objects can be used to argue for a possible parental connection .",
    "the particular cases pointed out above are all part of a much more general problem : how often are globular and open clusters interacting , even if weakly , in an environment similar to the solar neighbourhood",
    "? are these putative interactions relatively frequent or , on the contrary , very rare events ?",
    "if frequent , what is their most likely outcome ? here , we attempt to provide an answer to these rather general questions ; but , we also search for specific globular clusters in close proximity to a larger than average number of young open clusters and explore the possibility that some old open clusters may be linked to accreted globular clusters . before going into any further details ,",
    "we must also point out that the existence of gravitational interactions between globular and open clusters is , in fact , both intuitive and obvious the moment we accept that globular clusters and gmcs interact .",
    "open clusters are born out of gmcs ; therefore , they must follow very similar orbits and their kinematics must be virtually equivalent , especially for the youngest open clusters . if we admit that globular clusters can interact with gmcs , it immediately follows that globular and open clusters must be able to interact as well . for interacting globular clusters and gmcs",
    "we witness creation of stars ; for interacting globular and open clusters the most obvious outcome should be tidal disruption of the open cluster .",
    "it is true that gmcs are more massive and larger in size than open clusters but open clusters both outnumber and outlive gmcs . in this context , neglecting the existence of globular - open cluster interactions is equivalent to negate the obvious .",
    "the widely accepted assumption that globular and open clusters never interact probably has its roots in the fact that no globular clusters appear to exist within 1 kpc from the sun , the only region of the milky way where our open cluster census is reasonably complete .",
    "this combination of circumstances induces an obvious bias that conditions our approach to the general problem studied here . for this reason ,",

    "our results are placed within the context of other recent , related studies in sect .",
    "section 10 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the currently available information on star clusters in the milky way is incomplete and likely biased ( see below ) ; if we want to find out how often globular and open clusters are expected to interact in the solar neighbourhood , we should make few a priori assumptions and use theoretical arguments starting from general physical principles .",
    "this is the only approach that can yield solid conclusions when exploring the subject of globular - open cluster dynamical interactions and comparing with observational data .     as a function of @xmath0 assuming @xmath1 = 1 kpc , @xmath2 = 35 pc and three representative values of @xmath3 .",
    "encounters are only important if @xmath4 . for regions with high density of open clusters like the spiral arms or the bulge ( with @xmath5 ) the number of encounters per disk",
    "crossing could be as high as 50 ; for the typical environment of the solar neighbourhood could be around 10 ( nearly 400 open clusters within 1 kpc , see the text for details ) .",
    "globular clusters cross the disk twice per orbit .",
    "this plot displays results from eq .",
    "( [ timescale ] ) which are nearly five times larger than those from the more realistic eq .",
    "( [ timescale1 ] ) . ]    in the framework of kinetic theory ( see e.g. binney and tremaine 2008 ) , let us consider a sphere of radius @xmath1 enclosing @xmath0 open clusters .",
    "a globular cluster of tidal radius @xmath2 is moving across that sphere .",
    "the number density of open clusters within that sphere can be written as @xmath6 and they move with a root mean square ( rms , the rms value is a measure of the average value ) velocity @xmath7 ; @xmath7 is the average velocity with which open clusters move within that sphere .",
    "following innanen et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , for two clusters separated by a distance larger than three times the outer radius of each cluster , the amount of mutual disruption is rather negligible .",
    "the average value of the tidal radius for open clusters in the milky way disk is 10 pc and for globular clusters is 35 pc ( binney and tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "the interaction cross - section for such a globular cluster can be written as @xmath8 .",
    "the characteristic time - scale on which a globular cluster experiences an encounter with an open cluster is given by @xmath9 . in terms of the time taken by the globular cluster to cross the sphere or crossing time @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic velocity of the globular cluster ,",
    "we can write @xmath12 encounters are only important if @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ timescaleplot ] displays eq .",
    "( [ timescale ] ) as a function of the number of open clusters @xmath0 for three representative values of the ratio @xmath3 ( assumed to be in the range [ 1 , 3 ] , see below ) .",
    "if a globular cluster enters an environment like the solar neighbourhood , with nearly 400 open clusters within 1 kpc ( see below ) , some encounters are expected ; besides , the probability of undergoing discrete encounters reaches its peak value twice per globular cluster orbital period and globular clusters are very long lived .",
    "therefore , the probability of suffering at least one relatively close encounter with an open cluster integrated over the entire life of a typical globular cluster is far from zero .",
    "it is clear that , statistically speaking , the role of these interactions can not simply be ignored .    at this point",
    ", it may be argued that it is often assumed that @xmath13 . under that",
    "( wrong ) assumption , @xmath14 and the role of encounters becomes completely negligible .",
    "however , it is untrue that the typical total galactocentric velocities of globular and open clusters are so different . the local escape speed , 498 @xmath15 608 km  s@xmath16 ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , represents an upper limit to the total velocity of both globular and open clusters ; if a globular cluster is bound to the milky way , @xmath17 500 - 600 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , it is widely accepted that most open clusters move around the centre of the galaxy in almost - circular orbits .",
    "the local circular orbital velocity for objects in the disk is about 220 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "these values are fully consistent with our choice of [ 1 , 3 ] as the range in @xmath3 . in more detail and",
    "if we consider the well studied ( but nonetheless incomplete ) sample ( new hipparcos catalogue ) of 20 open clusters described in van leeuwen ( 2009 ) , the average total galactocentric velocity for open clusters in the solar neighbourhood is 224@xmath187 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "this value has been computed using the heliocentric velocity components from table 7 in van leeuwen ( 2009 ) , the peculiar motion of the sun relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) in schnrich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the in - plane circular motion of the lsr around the galactic centre .",
    "the rms value of the velocity component perpendicular to the galactic plane for this sample of 20 open clusters is 4.6 km  s@xmath16 . as for globular clusters , kalirai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that for ngc 6397 ( one of the objects of interest in this research , see below ) the total velocity relative to the galactic centre is 195 km  s@xmath16 with a vertical velocity of -140 km  s@xmath16 ; this cluster has made frequent passages through the galactic disk .",
    "such a globular cluster has a total velocity similar to that of an open cluster yet it crosses the thick disk in about 10 myr . for the samples of globular clusters in casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2007 , table 3 ) and casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2010 , table 5 ) we obtain an average total galactocentric velocity of 175@xmath1891 km  s@xmath16 and the rms value of the velocity component perpendicular to the galactic plane is 69 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "this group of 15 globular clusters have galactocentric distances in the range 0.7 - 11 kpc with separations from the galactic plane in the range [ -1.9 , 2.7 ] kpc .",
    "the slowest vertical motion is -7 km  s@xmath16 for ngc 6284 and the largest is -146 km  s@xmath16 for ngc 6293 .",
    "globular clusters crossing the disk typically spend between 5 and 150 myr to travel 1 kpc ; this translates into 1 to 13 encounters ( at least ) per crossing in the most typical cases , the ones of interest here .",
    "so far we have neglected the fact that , in the galaxy , open clusters are mainly found in the disk . if we include the disk s cylindrical geometry , our results are similar : @xmath19 where we assumed a volume of @xmath20 for the section of the disk with @xmath21 , the characteristic scale height of the disk .",
    "equation ( [ timescale1 ] ) assumes a globular cluster moving in an orbit with a small inclination with respect to the disk . for a polar orbit ( i.e. , a globular cluster crossing perpendicular to the disk ) , the following expression is obtained : @xmath22 which represents the most unfavourable case regarding globular - open cluster interactions .",
    "the ratio between the two expressions ( [ timescale1 ] and [ timescale2 ] ) is of order @xmath23 . the interaction rate ( 1/@xmath24 ) predicted by eq .",
    "( [ timescale1 ] ) is nearly 5 times larger than that from eq .",
    "( [ timescale ] )",
    ". the actual number of encounters can be even larger because our simplified analysis is neglecting gravitational focusing ; i.e. , the possibility that two clusters initially having an impact parameter @xmath25 , be brought closer together due to their mutual gravitational attraction as the relative velocities during the encounter could be , in some cases , similar to the escape velocity from the globular cluster . in high star cluster density environments like a spiral arm or near the galactic centre , dozens of encounters may be experienced within just 10 myr ( this is the time - scale to cross 2 kpc at about 200 km / s ) . in sharp contrast and for the outer disk ,",
    "globular - open cluster interactions are rare events . at high altitude over the galactic disk",
    "these encounters are completely negligible . in summary",
    ", a globular cluster traveling across an environment similar to the solar neighbourhood is expected to suffer about ten interactions with resident open clusters . in the milky way",
    ", there are about 58 globular clusters currently located @xmath26 1 kpc from the galactic plane . for those ,",
    "the interaction rate is @xmath27 1 myr@xmath16 .",
    "the two - phase system made of globular and open clusters is far from collisionless .",
    "but , what is the typical outcome to be expected after one of these encounters ? when two star clusters undergo a close encounter we may observe the formation of a transient binary system ending in merging ( if the relative velocity is low enough and both clusters have similar masses ) , full destruction of the less massive cluster , or ( more often ) a hyperbolic encounter in which both clusters emerge relatively unaffected and eventually separate ( de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2010 ) .",
    "most of the encounters are likely to be distant and may not have a major impact on the dynamics of the open cluster involved but if the minimum impact parameter is close to @xmath2 , the open cluster will be fully destroyed in a very short time - scale ( see e.g. figs 8 and 9 in de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2010 ) . as for the effects on the globular clusters themselves ,",
    "the continuous succession of even weak high speed encounters must cause slow erosion and eventually produce severe truncation by tidal forces .",
    "the mechanism is conceptually similar to the galaxy harassment , first described by moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , in galaxy clusters .",
    "repeated encounters can also induce a very low value for the luminosity of the affected clusters due to the loss of stars resulting from tidal effects . on the other hand , low - mass stars , which are more likely to be found in the outer regions of star clusters because of mass segregation , will be stripped off preferentially .",
    "encounters gradually perturb stars away from the path that they would have followed in a strictly collisionless environment .",
    "the characteristic time over which the loss of dynamical memory occurs is called the relaxation time .",
    "the actual impact of the encounters on the clusters can be better quantified using the relaxation time of the system that is @xmath28 100 myr for globular clusters and @xmath2910 myr ( with a range of 5 - 200 myr ) for typical open clusters . in both cases ,",
    "the effects of the encounters are not negligible as the relaxation time is longer than the characteristic time between encounters .",
    "however , globular clusters can better recover as many of them spend just about 20 myr per orbital period moving in regions where encounters are possible .",
    "the relaxation time is longer far from the centre of the cluster and shorter at the cluster core , the central regions of the clusters may be able to survive the frequent encounters but the outer regions will gradually be lost into the field .",
    "the picture that emerges from our analysis contradicts the conventional assumption that globular and open clusters are completely unrelated populations and never interact .",
    "the globular - open cluster dynamical connection uncovered here should translate into several observable trends and features among clusters within a few kpc from the sun :    * the number of globular - open cluster pairs with separations under @xmath30105 pc ( three times the average tidal radius for globulars in the milky way ) must be very small as open clusters interacting with a typical globular cluster at such short distance will not survive for long . * the number of globular - open cluster pairs should decrease with the separation , likely as a power - law . *",
    "globular clusters within the disk should be surrounded by a relatively large number of open clusters but few of them will be old ( age @xmath31 1 gyr ) objects .",
    "* globular clusters that have been involved in interactions should exhibit some level of tidal truncation . *",
    "the effects of this dynamical connection should be more important towards the bulge and the galactic centre .",
    "* open clusters following highly inclined orbits must be well protected against the effects of the encounters described here .",
    "this should translate into an obvious difference between the relative number of old open clusters observed at high and low galactic latitude ( more properly , altitude ) .",
    "the cluster harassment described here is just another mechanism to induce tidal truncation in globular clusters and operates concurrently with disk and bulge shocking as described by ( e.g. ) chernoff et al .",
    "( 1986 ) or fall and zhang ( 2001 ) and identified observationally by leon et al .",
    "cluster harassment has recently been discussed within the context of the disruption of star clusters in a hierarchical interstellar medium ( elmegreen and hunter 2010 ) .",
    "a tidally truncated globular cluster may still have a relatively large radius if it hosts a sizable population of black holes ( strader et al .",
    "2012 ) ; in addition , the average radius of globular clusters increases with increasing galactocentric distance .",
    "our theoretical analysis also indicates that interactions between globular clusters are extremely rare and for all practical purposes we can assume that globulars do not interact with other globular clusters in today s milky way . as for open clusters orbiting globular clusters within the milky way",
    ", the dynamical scenario presented here makes that situation highly unlikely . only a very recently accreted globular cluster ( more properly , dwarf galaxy ) may still be able to retain its own distinctive cohort of open clusters .",
    "the issue of the existence of a dynamical connection between globular and open clusters has been largely ignored in galactic studies ; contrary to our findings above , it is customarily assumed that globular and open clusters never interact .",
    "however , if such non - collisional scenario is valid , the distribution of intercluster distances should exhibit a distinctive shape . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the geometrical consequences of neglecting gravitational effects and assume that globular and open clusters never interact .",
    "globular clusters are mainly found towards the galactic centre and open clusters are mainly found in the disk .",
    "if their positions are uncorrelated , the number of pairs should be proportional to some power of the intercluster distance or separation .",
    "the study of the distribution of the distance between two randomly chosen points within a sphere ( or its two - dimensional analogue , a circle ) is a non - trivial problem and analytical formulae have repeatedly been found in the context of diverse fields : mathematics , physics , chemistry , biology .",
    "the main advantage of using analytical techniques is that results are exact and applicable as first order approximations to study complex real situations .",
    "the results for a disk ( or a circle ) may have been known since the late 19th century ( crofton 1885 ) and they have been rediscovered in multiple occasions later ( see e.g. garwood 1947 ; hammersley 1950 ; garwood and tanner 1958 ; barton et al .",

    "the more general problem of the distribution of distance between points independently and uniformly distributed in an arbitrary region has been revisited by alagar ( 1976 ) .",
    "here we review results for a circle and a sphere following hammersley ( 1950 ) .",
    "let us consider a sample of random points on a unit - diameter disk ( the inside of the unit - diameter circle ) , we want to find the distribution of euclidean distances or separations between two points at random on the disk . on a unit - diameter disk ,",

    "these facts strongly suggest that gmc - cluster interactions are not overly dominant with respect to globular - open cluster interactions ; in fact , both processes appear to be cooperating in the sense that they equally contribute to the tidal evolution of star clusters . on the other hand ,",

    "the impact of ggcd+ on our conclusions is negligible as the vast majority of the newly discovered objects are located far from both the sun and the milky way plane .",

    "more recently , piskunov et al . (",
    "2006 ) have concluded that , assuming uniform density , the completeness limit for clusters of any age could be 0.85 kpc .",
    "de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos ( 2009 ) found similar results : for objects in the age range 1 - 1000 myr located within 0.9 pc from the sun , the power - law index is 1.96@xmath180.05 with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 .",

    "therefore , our volume - limited open cluster samples are likely to be at least 90  % complete even for older clusters if the radial distance is restricted to about 1 kpc ; unfortunately and as pointed out above , there are no globular clusters within 1 kpc from the sun .",
    "based on this completeness limit , the actual number of open clusters of all ages within 1 kpc from the sun could be as high as @xmath30400 .",
    "given the fact that there are 389 open clusters of all ages within 1 kpc from the sun in ncovocc , it can be claimed that this sample is nearly 100  % complete . as for younger objects , which are most relevant to our present research in order to discuss the role of globular clusters in open cluster formation , de la fuente marcos and",
    "de la fuente marcos ( 2008a , 2009 ) have found reasonable evidence that the age distribution of young open clusters ( @xmath70 100 myr ) within 2.5 kpc from the sun is not severely affected by detection limits and it is likely nearly 90  % complete too .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that young star clusters contain very luminous stars that can be seen at large distances and the effect of incompleteness is , consistently , smaller for them . for our present sample ( see fig . [ com ] ) , the situation is similar although the uniform surface density model can not be invoked in this case as the power - law index is now intermediate ( 1.56@xmath180.04 with a correlation coefficient of 0.992 ) between that of the gmcs ( see sect .",
    "4 ) and that of the general , non - age - limited open cluster sample .",
    "the evolutionary behaviour of the value of the power - law index reflects the tendency for an increase in the average distance between surviving open clusters over time .",
    "although the quality of the data in the above databases is rather inhomogeneous and the data compilation is necessarily incomplete as it is the research in the field of star clusters in the milky way , we consider the samples used in this work as sufficiently complete and reliable , or at least as the best available for the purpose of this research .",
    "the current status of the accuracy of open cluster parameters has been reviewed by paunzen and netopil ( 2006 ) .",
    "they found that distances are rather well determined : the absolute error is less than 20  % for nearly 80  % of the best studied open clusters .",
    "the situation is quite the opposite for ages as only 11  % of the investigated open clusters have errors less than 20  % and 30  % exhibit an absolute error in the estimate of the age larger than 50  % .",
    "in addition to that , paunzen and netopil ( 2006 ) show that the errors are age dependent and the ones associated to young clusters are sometimes significantly larger ( in average ) than those of older objects , with 2030  % in the best possible cases . in a large sample ,",
    "these errors are non - homogeneous because different methods have been used by different authors to calculate the ages .",

    "we assume poissonian number counts and error bars display the 1@xmath67 poisson error , @xmath72 .",

    "the figure ( left - hand panel ) exhibits the expected quadratic trend for both young open clusters ( age @xmath26 50 myr , thick line ) and for the general sample ( without age restriction , thin line ) .",
    "the full sample gives a power - law index of 2.16@xmath180.07 with a correlation coefficient of 0.977 ; for young open clusters we obtain a power - law index of 1.95@xmath180.13 with a correlation coefficient of 0.919 .",

    "however , it must be pointed out that open cluster samples within 10 kpc from the sun are very incomplete for any age range ; the good agreement could easily be the result of heavy incompleteness .",
    "if we consider the pair subset characterized by intercluster distances @xmath26 3 kpc ( bottom panels ) , we are still well above the distinctive scale heights of both thick ( 1 kpc ) and thin ( 350 pc ) disks ( e.g. sparke and gallagher 2007 ) . we must however point out that it has recently been argued that the milky way has no distinct thick disk but a continuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses ( bovy et al .",

    "3 on the two regimes ) . in principle and for small separations ,",
    "if globular and open clusters are fully unrelated we should observe the linear behaviour as only globular clusters located within the disk contribute in this regime ; however , for very small separations ( smaller than the thickness of the disk ) the scenario locally resembles that of a spherical configuration and the @xmath75 should be expected .",
    "figure [ evidence ] ( bottom panels ) is consistent with linear growth ( correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.948 for the general and young samples , respectively ) for separations larger than 1 kpc but appears to be incompatible with that model for smaller separations and , more importantly , no pairs closer than 450 pc are observed .",
    "if we consider a @xmath75 model in the range 0 - 1 kpc , it fails to account for the irregular behaviour displayed and the lack of close pairs .",
    "the best fitting to the data for small separations is obtained for a power - law index of 2.9@xmath180.3 with a correlation coefficient of 0.927 .",
    "this corresponds to the red data displayed in the bottom panels ( fig .",

    "small deviations ( specially those associated to small numbers of pairs ) can be regarded as statistical fluctuations and they may not be significant ; however , the overall lack of pairs observed at small separations appears to be a real feature not attributable to fluctuations .",
    "this is one of the predictions of the mechanism described in sect .",
    "this scarcity of close pairs can be interpreted as the result of hypothetical globular - open cluster dynamical interactions .",
    "these interactions may be destructive ( cluster harassment ) , translating into reduced numbers of pairs at small separations , or constructive , as in the globular clusters passing through the disk and triggering formation of open clusters scenario .",
    "the results from fig .",
    "[ evidence ] are sensitive only to destructive interactions and they strongly suggest that globular clusters are not responsible for the destruction of a sizable fraction of young open clusters .",

    "the vast majority of the missing objects must be old open clusters , which are uniformly distributed .",
    "the impact of the missing clusters on the distribution of distances studied above must be evenly scattered ; i.e. , all the bins in the histogram must be equally affected by the lack of these uniformly distributed open clusters not a specific range of separations .",

    "fsr 1767 may be surrounded by a number of open clusters significantly larger than the one predicted by a simple non - collisional scenario . within this analysis ,",
    "fsr 1767 emerges as an archetypal globular cluster crossing the disk and surrounded by its ephemeral cloud of open clusters and likely inducing star formation in its neighbourhood .",
    "the monte carlo calculation presented above makes a major implicit assumption : clusters are distributed uniformly in the disk .",
    "unfortunately , the actual spatial distribution of open clusters in the milky way disk is not that simple .",
    "the spatial distribution of young open clusters in the solar neighbourhood exhibits multifractal structure ( de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2006 ) . for obvious reasons ,",
    "the majority of open clusters in our samples are young . besides , the fractal dimension is time - dependent , increasing over time .",
    "even if the positions of the clusters are organized following a fractal pattern , it is not clear which fractal model reproduces the overall spatial distribution better .",
    "there is however an alternative to using a particular fractal model , we can use the actual observed distribution ( which is fractal by itself ) .",
    "the sample of open clusters located within 1 kpc from the sun is almost 100  % complete and it has not been perturbed by globular clusters during the last 20 myr at least . in the following ,",
    "we replicate the spatial distribution of open clusters found in a square of side 2 kpc centred on the sun by shifting their coordinates to generate a grid of 9 equal squares and then we restrict the artificial sample created to those objects with @xmath91 and @xmath92 coordinates in the range [ -3 , 3 ] kpc and @xmath93 in the range [ -1 , 1 ] kpc all within a cylinder of radius 3 kpc and thickness 2 kpc",
    ". these are  real \" coordinates so they take into account that most open clusters are found within 200 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "then we use the artificially generated ( complete ) fractal sample to study the intercluster distance separation .",
    "this approach has multiple advantages over the previous one : we use a realistic fractal distribution of positions , the template sample ( used in the replication process ) was not under the direct effects of neighbouring globular clusters , and the sample is complete . here",
    ", we are implicitly assuming that every location within the solar circle is equivalent which is a very reasonable assumption .",
    "our analysis includes the actual coordinates of ngc 6121 , ngc 6397 and ngc 6544 .",
    "the calculation has been repeated by randomly removing a fraction of the clusters to simulate different levels of completeness so the number of pairs displayed are associated to samples with different degree of completeness although the results focus on 100 and 35  % . as in the previous simulations ,",
    "2@xmath94 trials for each sample have been computed in order to provide statistical significance to our results .",
    "figure [ clone ] confirms again the scarcity of close pairs with respect to a model in which globular clusters have no effects on the spatial distribution of open clusters .",
    "the results are consistent with those in figs .",
    "[ evidence ] and [ monte ] .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the average number of open clusters close to a globular cluster in the solar neighbourhood is significantly below the expected value in a purely non - collisional scenario : globular and open clusters are indeed interacting populations and globular clusters do affect the environment in which they move .",
    "it may be argued that the statistically significant deviations appear only for separations @xmath31 500 pc when the tidal effects are expected to be more important at smaller separations . as pointed out before , statistical fluctuations are responsible for that ; the ratio between the number of pairs and the standard deviation is only @xmath31 1 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 . therefore , if the actual number of pairs is 0 and the one predicted by the non - collisional model is 10 , the relative deviation in terms of @xmath67 is @xmath26 3 although the actual difference is far from negligible .",
    "these fluctuations actually mask the mismatch between the real data and those from the non - collisional model at smaller separations making real data apparently compatible with the non - collisional scenario . for a much larger sample , instead of a few thousand clusters , statistically significant differences should be observed across the entire range of separations .",
    "our results for simulated samples are fully consistent with our previous theoretical analysis in sect .",

    "on the other hand , the list of close older neighbours includes ngc 6253 ( 460 pc , 5 gyr ) , eso 282 - 26 ( 510 pc , 1.3 gyr ) , ngc 6698 ( 551 pc , 1.9 gyr ) , eso 397 - 01 ( 579 pc , 1.3 gyr ) , lynga 8 ( 618 pc , 2 gyr ) , ruprecht 138 ( 628 pc , 2.0 gyr ) , ngc 5998 ( 635 pc , 1.6 gyr ) , ruprecht 171 ( 650 pc , 3.2 gyr ) , eso 139 - 54 ( 662 pc , 1.3 gyr ) , ic 4651 ( 671 pc , 1.1 gyr ) and ngc 6208 ( 686 pc , 1.2 gyr ) . but and",

    "( 2007 ) . there ,",
    "an age of 12 gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -1.2 are suggested for fsr 1767 .",
    "most of the old open clusters cited above do not have kinematic or chemical information available from webda or ncovocc and none of the few available are consistent with the properties of fsr 1767 .",
    "therefore and even if the fraction of neighbouring old open clusters is statistically significant , no other available data support a possible dynamical connection between this globular cluster and any of the objects in its long list of neighbouring old open clusters .",
    "but , is fsr 1767 a real globular cluster ?",
    "unfortunately , the very nature of fsr 1767 as a globular cluster is still under debate .",
    "located in scorpius , this palomar - like object was discovered by froebrich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and further studied by bonatto et al .",
    "it is one of the closest globular clusters ( 1.5 kpc from the sun ) , 50 pc below the galactic plane .",
    "it has a very small core of 0.24 pc and a tidal radius of 3.1 pc ( bonatto et al .",
    "if this cluster is passing through the galactic disk , it may have been stripped of a large fraction of its outermost members leaving just the stronger gravitationally bound core .",
    "the cluster appears very distorted although no formal calculation of its ellipticity has been attempted .",
    "the object has been re - analyzed using new ntt observations by froebrich et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to conclude that it is not a star cluster but an observational artefact caused by differential extinction .",
    "however , this negative conclusion has been disputed : bonatto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) combined old and new data to show that the properties of the object are consistent with those of a globular cluster . their main argument against froebrich et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is that their calibration of the fsr 1767 data is erroneous .",
    "however , for the other clusters in the same dataset results from both groups are fully consistent and the original sofi / ntt data were not re - analyzed in bonatto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . for them , fsr 1767 is a nearby low - luminosity , relatively metal - poor globular cluster projected against the bulge .",
    "they also found a peculiar compact stellar group in the central parts of the cluster that they interpret as a possible detached post - collapse core .",
    "however , _",
    "chandra _ observations looking for a putative x - ray source population in the field of fsr 1767 using the new coordinates provided by bonatto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have proven negative .",
    "no x - ray sources within 4 arcminutes of the new coordinates have been detected .",
    "this finding rules out the presence of any quiescent x - ray binaries .",
    "fainter objects such as millisecond radio pulsars or cataclysmic variables were below the detection limit of the _ chandra _ observations , therefore their presence can not be ruled out .",
    "detection of clustered x - ray sources is customarily regarded as solid confirmation of the globular cluster nature of an old stellar ensemble .",
    "the topic of how globular clusters are affected by the galactic disk has been investigated for decades but the study of their impact on the disk structures is relatively new .",
    "to put our current results into perspective , cluster shocking during passage through the galactic disk has long been considered a main threat to the long - term survivability of globular clusters ( ostriker et al .",
    "1972 ) but the reaction of the disk to that passage was not studied or even mentioned until much later . in a little - known paper , brosche et al .",
    "( 1991 ) stated that  every transit of a globular cluster through the interstellar matter in the galactic plane will , in principle , affect this material .",
    "there is slight hope that such perturbing effects may be noticeable even today . \" for these authors , the expected signature would take the form of a remnant  shot hole \" imprinted in the interstellar matter .",
    "high - velocity clouds can also generate a cavity when they collide with the galactic disk ( tenorio - tagle 1981 ; tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "the capture of field stars by passing globular clusters has been studied mainly by bica et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mieske and baumgardt ( 2007 ) , the latter found it not very efficient . on both theoretical and observational grounds , present - day , tidally triggered star formation in the milky way disk has been suggested as a plausible secondary mechanism capable of forming open clusters ( wallin et al .",
    "1996 ; levy 2000 ; de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2008b ; vande putte and cropper 2009 ) .",
    "the implied tidal encounter paradigm involves interactions between passing globular clusters ( and perhaps dwarf galaxies too ) and giant molecular clouds . a version of this mechanism based on toomre s parameter was first applied to globular clusters crossing along paths perpendicular to the galactic plane by wallin et al . ( 1996 )",
    "although their theoretical arguments may not be valid for clusters moving in paths not strictly normal to the disk ( de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2008b ) , i.e. globular clusters in non - polar orbits . nevertheless , hydrodynamic simulations carried out by levy ( 2000 ) and vande putte and cropper ( 2009 ) lent further support to the early results obtained by wallin et al .",
    "de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos ( 2008b ) used a different version of the tidal encounter paradigm in an attempt to explain present - day star formation at high galactic altitude . in this case , the analysis was based on the jeans criterion under the distant - tide and impulse approximations ( binney and tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "this new version of the paradigm does not assume any particular inclination for the orbit of the perturbing globular cluster .",
    "the topic has been brought again to the attention of the astronomical community by salerno et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , suggesting that @xmath98 centauri was involved in the formation of the young massive open clusters stephenson 2 and bdsb 122 . in their paper",
    ", it is claimed that current evidence is consistent with globular clusters being additional progenitors of open clusters ; in particular , the most massive ones .",
    "vande putte and cropper ( 2009 ) have identified three globular clusters as strong candidates to being responsible for tidally induced star formation .",
    "two of them , ngc 6397 and ngc 3201 , have young neighbour clusters following the criteria used in the present work although only the case of ngc 6397 appears to be statistically significant .",
    "vande putte and cropper ( 2009 ) consider that some of the stellar associations observed close to ngc 6397 are remnants of a recent interaction . in our analysis ,",
    "ngc 6397 appears as statistically significant and therefore consistent with their interpretation .",
    "ngc 3201 is a globular cluster in vela with very low central stellar concentration and ellipticity 0.12 .",
    "it has only two open clusters within 1 kpc .",
    "the third candidate identified in vande putte and cropper ( 2009 ) , ngc 6838 ( m 71 ) , has one young neighbour but three other clusters are close to it .",
    "located in sagitta , it is one of the globular clusters exhibiting abundance variations ( alves - brito et al .",
    "the young open cluster ngc 6231 is considered by vande putte and cropper ( 2009 ) as not related to any globular cluster - induced star formation episode but our results do not support this conclusion as it is one of the close neighbours of fsr 1767 . in general , our results appear to be consistent with those from other authors .",
    "vande putte et al . (",
    "2009 ) have also suggested that passing globular clusters may contribute to the galactic disk heating .",
    "our analysis of the results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ timescale ] ) also favours an scenario in which globular clusters contribute towards the vertical heating of disk objects .",
    "vande putte et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have analyzed the orbits of 481 open clusters to conclude that three of them ( ngc 1817 , ngc 6791 and ngc 7044 ) may have formed as a result of the impact of a globular cluster on the disk .",
    "our present results do not support their conclusions .",
    "as a manner of summary and in the milky way , theory and observations consistently indicate that globular and open clusters certainly are interacting populations .",
    "globular and open clusters have traditionally been considered as completely unrelated only because no globular clusters are present within 1 kpc from the sun and our data on open clusters are very incomplete ; in contrast , the emerging picture from our analysis is quite the opposite . at the solar circle , there is an obvious scarcity of close globular - open cluster pairs and the likely explanation is linked to passing globular clusters that can tidally disrupt small open clusters in a short time - scale . in sect . 1 , we pointed out that it is conventionally assumed that globular and open clusters never interact , they have virtually no connections . this paper has explored the reliability of this assumption and has found reasonable statistical evidence to discard it .",
    "globular and open clusters are indeed connected , this connection is of dynamical nature , and it may include several distinct manifestations : cluster - cluster interactions or cluster harassment , induced open cluster formation by globulars and possible association of old open clusters to accreted globulars . we have investigated the statistical strength of these manifestations further using samples from several databases , recent results from the literature and monte carlo - type calculations .",
    "fsr 1767 , if real , could be the archetypal example of this scenario in which globular and open clusters interact at will . in this respect , another object deserving further study is 2mass - gc01 .",
    "both objects appear to be rather unique and better observations of them are urgently needed .    both theory and observations",
    "indicate that repeated weak and distant encounters between open clusters and traveling globular clusters may contribute towards tidal truncation , in the case of globular clusters , and accelerated disruption ( in just a few myr ) , in the case of open clusters .",
    "the strength of this process , tidal destruction of open clusters by passing globular clusters , seems to be quite significant but , so far , customarily ignored .",
    "this may well be the evolutionary path for the cluster pair fsr 1767/ruprecht 127 , with a separation of just 36 pc .",
    "the actual existence of ruprecht 127 is however debatable .",
    "mcswain and gies ( 2005 ) consider this object an asterism : a chance physical alignment of several bright stars .",
    "however , irrgang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested ruprecht 127 as one of the possible origins of the hyper - runaway candidate hip 60350 .",
    "regarding the issue of present - day open cluster formation induced by the passage of globular clusters , the amount of induced star formation seems to be modest as expected of a secondary mechanism .",
    "the fraction of globular clusters currently involved in these events appears to be relatively small although if we restrict our analysis to globular clusters located within 3 kpc from the sun , the entire sample appears to have experienced relatively close encounters with young open clusters within the last 10 myr and likely all of them may have been involved in tidally induced star formation events . with the exception of fsr 1767 , dynamical association between old open clusters and globular clusters is not supported by currently available data .    in this introductory paper , we have presented robust theoretical and statistical evidence on the existence of gravitational interactions between globular and open clusters and their effects on both cluster populations but yet many other interesting related topics have been left outside of our study .",
    "areas not covered here include a detailed dynamical analysis of such interactions , their effects on the chemo - dynamical evolution of the galactic disk , the importance ( in absolute terms ) of the shock - induced star and cluster formation , the possibility of generating a thick disk of stars as a result of these interactions , the potential role of the open cluster thick disk as tracer of the chemical and age evolution of the disk , the capture of stars from the tidally disrupted open clusters by the interacting globular clusters , their connection with the observed stellar streams , among others .",
    "unfortunately , the serious study of many of these topics , although certainly desirable , requires high quality observational data sets that are not yet available .",
    "future surveys , in our galaxy and others , may determine the full extent of the impact of the processes discussed here on the evolution of galactic disks .    the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for his / her very constructive report and helpful suggestions , and edward cackett for providing his unpublished _",

    "<S> historically , it has been assumed that globular and open clusters never interact . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent evidence suggests that : globular clusters passing through the disk may be able to perturb giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) triggering formation of open clusters and some old open clusters may be linked to accreted globulars . here , we further explore the existence of possible dynamical connections between globular and open clusters , and realize that the most obvious link must be in the form of gravitational interactions . </S>",
    "<S> if open clusters are born out of gmcs , they have to move in similar orbits . </S>",
    "<S> if we accept that globulars can interact with gmcs , triggering star formation , it follows that globular and open clusters must also interact . </S>",
    "<S> consistently , theoretical arguments as well as observational evidence , show that globular and open clusters certainly are interacting populations and their interactions are far more common than usually thought , especially for objects part of the bulge / disk . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo calculations confirm that conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> globular clusters seem capable of not only inducing formation of open clusters but , more often , their demise . </S>",
    "<S> relatively frequent high speed cluster encounters or cluster harassment may also cause , on the long - term , slow erosion and tidal truncation on the globulars involved . </S>",
    "<S> the disputed object fsr 1767 ( 2mass - gc04 ) may be , statistically speaking , the best example of an ongoing interaction . </S>"
