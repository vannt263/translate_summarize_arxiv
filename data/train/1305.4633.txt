    "the textbook picture of ism phases posits that gmcs are assembled in spiral arm shocks from diffuse interarm hi gas and then photo - dissociated back into the atomic phase by ob star formation within the spiral arms ( figure [ fig : scheme ] _ left _ ) .",
    "this picture predicts a rapid gas - phase change across spiral arms  from atomic to molecular and back into atomic after spiral arm passage .",
    "in retrospect , observational support for this standard picture left some unanswered questions .",
    "there were intense debates on the distribution and lifetime of gmcs in the mw in 1980 s , which were never fully resolved .",
    "indeed , two major galactic plane co ( @xmath1=1 - 0 ) surveys arrived at contradictory results .",
    "the columbia survey ( and the harvard survey later ) found very little co emission in the inter - arm regions in the longitude - velocity ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) diagram , suggesting that gmcs survive only for the duration of spiral arm passage ( an order of @xmath4-@xmath5 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the massachusett - stony brook survey found an abundant population of gmcs even in the inter - arm regions , concluding that gmcs live for the order of the galactic rotation timescale ( @xmath6 myr ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "early interferometric observations found only few gmcs in the inter - arm regions in the grand - design spiral galaxy m51 @xcite , apparently supporting the textbook picture . however , interferometric observations have a well - known disadvantage in studies of extended nearby galaxies . arrays with @xmath7 antennas ( e.g. , nobeyama , ovro , bima , and pdbi arrays ) miss most of spatial information , especially in extended inter - arm regions , being biased toward confined emission along the spiral arms .",
    "mapping gmcs in inter - arm regions , especially in presence of bright spiral arms , was difficult even when sensitivity was not an issue .",
    "a combination of modern arrays with @xmath8 antennas and single - dish telescopes permits high - quality molecular gas imaging .",
    "an abundant gmc population in the inter - arm regions was found in the molecule - rich galaxy m51 , using the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) and the nobeyama radio observatory 45 m ( nro45 ) telescope @xcite .",
    "the combination of carma and nro45 provided an unprecedented high - image quality , reconstructing the full emission including the most extended component @xcite .    in m51 , the majority of the gas remains molecular from arm entry through the interarm region and into the next spiral arm passage .",
    "the molecular gas fraction varies only little azimuthally .",
    "the most massive gmcs ( giant molecular associations  gmas ) appear only along spiral arms ( figure [ fig : m51gmc ] ) , suggesting that they are first assembled from pre - existing smaller gmcs entering the spiral arms , and then broken up as the gas flows through the arms . the gmas and their h@xmath9 molecules",
    "are not fully dissociated into atomic gas as predicted in stellar feedback scenarios , but are fragmented into smaller gmcs upon leaving the spiral arms .",
    "the remnants of gmas are detected as the chains of gmcs that emerge from the spiral arms into interarm regions .",
    "the observed kinematic shear within the spiral arms is sufficient to unbind the gmas against self - gravity .",
    "@xcite discussed that the evolution of gmcs is driven by large - scale galactic dynamics  their coagulation into gmas is due to spiral arm streaming motions , and their fragmentation as they leave the arms is due to shear .",
    "therefore , the lifetime of molecular gas appears to be an order of the galactic rotation timescale ( @xmath6 myr ) , while gmcs can be coagulated and/or fragmented to the next - generation gmcs without passing through the atomic phase .",
    "a similar gmc mass segregation between spiral arms and inter - arm regions is found in the milky way , another molecule - rich galaxy .",
    "gmcs exist also in the inter - arm regions , but their masses are about an order of magnitude smaller than their counterparts in the spiral arms @xcite . the same tend is being found in other molecule - rich spiral galaxies in the carma - nobeyama nearby - galaxies ( canon ) co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) survey , in which 29 local spiral galaxies are observed with both carma and nro45 .",
    "comparisons of molecule - rich and atom - rich galaxies provide another clue in understanding gmc evolution .",
    "smaller local ( dwarf ) galaxies rich in atomic gas ( e.g. , lmc and m33 ) show much fewer gmcs in their disks @xcite .",
    "the gmcs are almost exclusively associated with hi spiral arms and filaments and are mostly absent in the inter - arm regions .",
    "these observations immediately indicate their short lifetimes ( an arm - crossing timescale of @xmath10 myr ) .",
    "@xcite found a similar lifetime of 20 - 30 myr in lmc , by translating the fractions of gmcs with and without young star clusters to their lifetimes using cluster ages as a gauge .",
    "@xcite also found a similar lifetime of 20 - 40 myr in m33 by comparing co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) data and star clusters .",
    "the short lifetime of gmcs appears to be common in these atom - rich galaxies .",
    "in retrospect , the observations of extragalactic gmcs beyond the mw were limited to these closest , predominantly atom - rich galaxies ; this bias might have contributed to the textbook picture of gmc evolution .    as a side note , these relatively - short lifetimes may still be at odds with the even shorter dissipation timescale of internal velocity dispersions ( a few myr ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is difficult to maintain the velocity dispersions even for the relatively short lifetime of 20 - 30 myr .",
    "an interesting transitional case has been found recently in the central 4 kpc region of m33 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ fig : m33_gmc ] ) . in this atom - rich galaxy ,",
    "gmcs are located predominantly in hi spiral structures in most of the disk @xcite , indicating that gmcs form and die there .",
    "however , they do not coincide with hi structures in the central @xmath11 kpc , just as in the disks of molecule - rich galaxies .",
    "gmcs are decoupled from the hi distribution as if they are entities that survive through almost a galactic rotation period .",
    "the molecular gas fraction increases in this central region , although the dominant phase of gas there is still atomic @xcite .",
    "there are many parameters potentially responsible for this transition , including the amount of gas , stellar gravitational potential , metallicity , radiation field , dynamical environment ( such as shear ) , etc .",
    "obviously , a much larger sample is necessary to isolate the cause .",
    "molecular gas dominates even in the inter - arm regions in the mw and m51 .",
    "evidence is being accumulated that the physical conditions of molecular gas vary systematically as the gas enters spiral arms .",
    "the co @xmath12 and @xmath13 line ratio ( @xmath14 ) varies systematically in m51 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure [ fig : co2110 ] _ left _ ) .",
    "@xmath14 rises clearly from a typical low value of @xmath15 ( and often 0.4 - 0.6 ) in the inter - arm regions to a higher value of @xmath16 ( 0.8 - 1.0 ) in the spiral arms , particularly at the leading ( downstream ) edge of the molecular arms .",
    "these high and low @xmath14 are similar to those in galactic gmcs with and without ob star formation , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the physical conditions of molecular gas evolve during arm passage .",
    "the current spatial resolution of this image ( @xmath17 kpc ) almost certainly blends multiple gmcs .",
    "assuming all the unresolved gmcs share similar physical conditions , we can apply a simple one - zone analysis . note that virtually all co emission should come from unresolved gmcs ,",
    "since the co molecule is easily photo - dissociated without self - shielding .",
    "it is also difficult to collisionally excite co emission outside gmcs , as the critical density is about the average density within gmcs ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a large velocity gradient radiative transfer calculation provides insight into the changes in the physical conditions .",
    "the @xmath14 variations indicate that cold and low density gas ( @xmath19 k , @xmath20 pc ) is required for the interarm gmcs but this gas must become warmer and/or denser , by a factor of 2 - 3 , in the more active star forming spiral arms ( figure [ fig : co2110 ] _ right _ ) .",
    "we can not separate the increases in temperature and density with the two line analysis .",
    "however , the enhanced @xmath14 at the arm downstream may suggest that the main cause is stellar heating .",
    "indeed , most star formation is found at the downstream side @xcite , and @xmath14 is higher in areas of high @xmath21 m dust surface brightness ( which is an approximate tracer of star formation rate surface density ) .",
    "some upstream regions also show high @xmath14 , possibly indicating density increases before star formation .",
    "the sizes of gmcs need to be shrunk only by 20 - 30% as they enter spiral arms in order to increase gmc densities by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "we can resolve molecular gas structure at small scales in the milky way disk and study its evolution in relation to the spiral structure .",
    "@xcite demonstrated remarkable variations of molecular gas structure between inter - arm regions and spiral arms ( figure [ fig : maps_armintarm ] ) .",
    "their line of sight , @xmath22 , samples the molecular gas in both the sagittarius arm and the inter - arm regions , and hence the regions can be distinguished in velocity channel maps .",
    "the inter - arm emission appears mostly featureless and extended , while the spiral arm shows a lot of clumps ( @xmath23 pc in size ; either dense or / and warm ) .",
    "the velocity channel of the highest clump fraction coincides with those of h ii regions and high co 3 - 2/1 - 0 intensity ratio integrated over the field ( i.e. , warm on average ) .",
    "it also appears offset from the molecular spiral arm velocity , indicating that the clumps are at its downstream side .",
    "therefore , bright and spatially confined structures develop in a spiral arm , leading to star formation at downstream side , while extended molecular emission dominates in the inter - arm region .    to quantify the development of the small - scale molecular structure , @xcite introduced the brightness distribution index ( bdi ) , @xmath24 with typical boundary brightness temperatures to enclose the extended and lumpy components ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the bdi measures the fractional contribution of spatially confined bright molecular emission over faint emission extended over large areas .",
    "this relative quantity is largely independent of the amount of molecular gas and of any conventional , pre - conceived structures , such as cores , clumps , or giant molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite confirmed the same evolution over the mw disk .",
    "they applied the bdi to the entire inner mw disk in the northern hemisphere , using archival data from the boston university - five college radio astronomy observatory @xmath29co @xmath30 1 - 0 galactic ring survey ( figure [ fig : bdi ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the structured molecular gas , traced by higher bdi , appear continuously along the spiral arms in the @xmath31 diagram .",
    "the high - bdi gas generally coincides with areas with a high population of h ii regions , while there is also some high - bdi gas with no / little signature of ongoing star formation .",
    "these results support the evolutionary sequence in which unstructured , extended gas transforms itself into a structured state on encountering the spiral arms , followed by star formation and an eventual return to the unstructured state after spiral arm passage .",
    "we saw that the evolution of gmcs depends strongly on the parent galactic environment .",
    "atom - rich , small ( dwarf ) galaxies show gmcs almost exclusively on hi spiral arms and filaments , suggesting their lifetimes as short as an arm - crossing time of 20 - 30 myr . on the other hand , in molecule - rich spiral galaxies gmcs",
    "are found almost everywhere , including the inter - arm regions .",
    "the lifetimes there could be as long as a galactic rotation timescale of @xmath32 myr ( they stay molecular throughout galactic rotation , though gmcs can be coagulated and/or fragmented into next - generation gmcs ) . the textbook picture of the gas evolution predicts a rapid atomic / molecular phase change across spiral arms , but this needs to be revised based on new observations .",
    "we saw clear evidence for the evolution of physical conditions and structure of molecular gas in galactic disks .",
    "the molecular gas and gmcs become denser and/or warmer in spiral arms , and small pc - scale structures ( dense or warm clumps ) develop during spiral arm passage .    with alma , we are at an exciting moment for furthering understanding of the evolution of the ism in galaxies .",
    "extragalactic gmcs will be easily identified and resolved .",
    "multi - line analyses become possible for individual gmcs with an alma sensitivity .",
    "we have not yet seen the full imaging capability of alma , as most early observations are designed solely on sensitivity .",
    "complete synthesis observations with the full alma array , in conjunction with short - spacing data from the total power telescopes and compact array , will revolutionize image fidelity , and enable imaging of highly - complex molecular structures in nearby galaxies .                          , j. , scoville , n. , sawada , t. , la vigne , m.  a. , vogel , s.  n. , potts , a.  e. , carpenter , j.  m. , corder , s.  a. , wright , m.  c.  h. , white , s.  m. , zauderer , b.  a. , patience , j. , sargent , a.  i. , bock , d.  c.  j. , hawkins , d. , hodges , m. , kemball , a. , lamb , j.  w. , plambeck , r.  l. , pound , m.  w. , scott , s.  l. , teuben , p. , & woody , d.  p. 2009",
