    "flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes and charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry violation observed in the quark sector are known to be duly explained in the standard model ( sm ) framework via the quark mixing mechanism @xcite .",
    "nowadays , experimental searches of cp violation and fcnc s in the leptonic sector are among the most interesting problems in particle physics since they would eventually shed some light on the origin of mixing and masses of leptons . actually , since lf violating processes originating from mixing of neutrinos",
    "are expected to occur at an unobservable small level @xcite , their observation would clearly indicate evidence for new physics beyond the sm @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the lf violating processes that may occur in the production or decay of a neutral pseudoscalar meson @xmath0 due to the exchange of a neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) . to be more specific",
    ", we will focus on lf violation in all possible @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay channels ( @xmath3 are charged leptons ) that are allowed by kinematics .",
    "although our main focus is on lf violating processes , for the purposes of comparison we will also consider lf conserving decays of neutral heavy mesons by assuming that they are induced by the higgs boson @xmath6 alone .    with the advent of b meson factories ,",
    "large sets of @xmath7 lepton pairs have been accumulated by both babar and belle experiments @xcite allowing to improve previous bounds on flavor violating @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson decays .",
    "we note also that the flavor violating decays of our interest have been studied in a large variety of new physics models and using different approximations @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive set of bounds on r - parity violating couplings from these lfv decays were obtained in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study these decays in the framework of a general two higgs doublet model type - iii ( 2hdm - iii ) @xcite which contains flavor violation via yukawa interactions of the neutral higgs bosons at the tree - level . in this paper",
    "we work in a type iii 2hdm with four - texture yukawa couplings , where the yukawa matrices are assumed to be hermitean , this implies that cp symmetry is respected by the yukawa interactions of neutral higgs bosons which largely simplifies the analysis since only the pseudoscalar higgs boson contributes to the decay amplitudes of the processes under consideration .",
    "it is worth noticing that a restricted set of these @xmath7 decays were considered in ref.@xcite in the 2hdm - iii but without assuming cp conservation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide the yukawa interactions for the neutral higgs bosons . in section 3 , we derive the lfv effective four - fermion hamiltonian and we provide the numerical values of couplings relevant for our calculations .",
    "the formulae needed to evaluate the two - body decay rates are given in section 4 ; from a comparison with the experimental upper limits on branching fractions we derive the bounds on flavor violating couplings .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we present our conclusions .",
    "all lepton flavor violating processes in the sm have vanishing decay probabilities at the tree level and even at 1-loop level they are completely negligible @xcite and beyond the reach of present and planned experiments .",
    "therefore , flavor violation at a level accessible to experiments can be expected only in the framework of new physics scenarios . in this section",
    "we discuss the yukawa couplings of fermions in the 2hdm - iii which can induce flavor - changing neutral current processes both in the leptonic and quark sectors .",
    "we also provide numerical values of couplings that enter the hadronic matrix elements .    in the next subsections we shall derive the yukawa interactions of the scalar @xmath9 and pseudoscalar ( @xmath6 ) neutral higgs bosons with the charged lepton and quark sectors of the 2hdm - iii by assuming four - texture mass matrices @xcite .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the 2hdm - iii for the charged lepton sector is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denote the higgs doublets and @xmath12 denote the doublet of left - handed leptons .",
    "the specific choices for the yukawa matrices @xmath13 define the versions of the 2hdm known as type i , ii or iii .    after spontaneous symmetry breaking the charged lepton mass matrix is given by , @xmath14 now we assume that both yukawa matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the four - texture form and are hermitian ; following the conventions of @xcite , the lepton mass matrix is then written as : m_l= (    ccc 0 & c_l & 0 + c_l^ * & _ l & b_l + 0 & b_l^ * & a_l    ) , such that when @xmath17 one recovers the six - texture form .",
    "we will also consider the following hierarchy , @xmath18 , which is supported by the observed fermion masses in the sm .    because of the hermiticity condition , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real parameters , while the phases @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , can be removed from the mass matrix @xmath24 by defining : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] , and the mass matrix @xmath27 includes only the real parts of @xmath24 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath28 is then obtained by means of an orthogonal matrix @xmath29 , such that the diagonal mass matrix is @xmath30 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagleptons ] ) can be expanded in terms of the mass - eigenstates for the neutral ( @xmath31 ) and charged higgs bosons ( @xmath32 ) .",

    ", the terms proportional to @xmath38 corresponds to the modification of the 2hdm - ii over the sm result , while the terms proportional to @xmath39 denotes the new contribution from the 2hdm - iii .",
    "thus , the physical fermion - higgs couplings respect cp - invariance , despite the fact that the yukawa matrices include complex phases ; this follows because of the hermiticity conditions imposed on both @xmath40 and @xmath41 matrices .",
    "the correction terms to the lepton flavor conserving ( lfc ) and violating ( lfv ) couplings , depend on the rotated matrix @xmath42 .",
    "we can derive @xmath43 , by assuming that @xmath41 has a four - texture form , namely : y_2^l= (    ccc 0 & c_2 & 0 + c_2^ * & _ 2 & b_2 + 0 & b_2^ * & a_2    ) , a_2 _ 2,b_2,c_2 . since the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the real matrix @xmath44 with the four - texture form , has the form : o = (    ccc & & + - & & + & - &    ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then the rotated form of @xmath47 acquires the general form , @xmath48    the full expressions for the resulting entries of this matrix have a complicated form . to derive a convenient approximation",

    "thus , we propose the following relation for @xmath50 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    if we now introduce the dimensionless matrix @xmath55 , we get : @xmath56 this expression differs from the usual cheng - sher @xmath57 @xcite not only because of the appearance of the complex phases , but also in the form of the real parts @xmath58 , the entries of the matrix @xmath55 become : @xmath59\\eta      + [ a_{2}+\\tilde{b}_{2}-(b^*_{2}e^{i\\phi_{b } } + b_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{b } } ) ]           \\beta \\nonumber \\\\ \\tilde{\\chi}_{12 } & = & ( c_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{c}}-\\tilde{b}_{2 } ) -\\eta[a_{2}+ \\tilde{b}_{2}-(b^*_{2}e^{i\\phi_{b } } + b_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{b } } ) ] \\beta ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\tilde{\\chi}_{13 } & = & ( a_{2}-b_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{b } } ) \\eta \\sqrt{\\beta }                             \\nonumber   \\\\ \\tilde{\\chi}_{22 }   & = & \\tilde{b}_{2}\\eta + [ a_{2}+\\tilde{b}_{2}-(b^*_{2}e^{i\\phi_{b } } + b_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{b } } ) ]           \\beta \\nonumber \\\\ \\tilde{\\chi}_{23 } & = & ( b_{2}e^{-i\\phi_{b}}-a_{2 } )                                \\sqrt{\\beta } \\nonumber   \\\\ \\tilde{\\chi}_{33 } & = & a_{2 } \\label{chileptons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as it can be easily checked , the diagonal elements @xmath60 are real and the phases appear in the off - diagonal elements ; we note that these elements are not constrained by current low - energy phenomena .",

    "<S> we study flavor violating processes in the production or decay of a neutral pseudoscalar meson @xmath0 in the framework of a type iii two higgs doublet model with four - texture yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we use a version of the model where yukawa interactions of neutral higgs bosons allow for flavor change at the tree - level , but conserves cp symmetry . the physical yukawa couplings respect cp - invariance due to the hermiticity conditions that we impose on the fermion mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on all possible @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay channels , where @xmath3 are charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these processes provide complementary information on quark and lepton fcnc yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular flavor violating parameters in the quark sector , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are significantly constrained by present experimental data , whereas the corresponding parameters in the leptonic sector are less constrained . </S>"
