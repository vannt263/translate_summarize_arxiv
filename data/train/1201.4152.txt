    "as we shall see , the situation is not so simple , notably because the expression of the function is fairly complicated to deal with , in particular when it is given under an integral form , which is a frequent situation in concrete case studies .",
    "if we restrict question [ question - asymptotic ] to the computation of asymptotic estimates for the number of walks ending at the origin @xmath10 ( these numbers are the coefficients of @xmath29 , see ) , a very recent paper @xcite solved the problem for much more general random walks in @xmath30 , for any @xmath31 : indeed , the authors obtain the leading term of the estimate , up to a coefficient involving two unknown harmonic functions . on the other hand , it is impossible to deduce from @xcite the asymptotic behavior of the number of walks ending , for instance , at one axis ( coefficients of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , or anywhere ( coefficients of @xmath34 ) .    still with respect to question [ question - asymptotic ] ,",

    "indeed , with regard to random walks evolving in the quarter plane , and more generally in cones , the question of the asymptotic tail distribution of the first hitting time of the boundary has been for many decades of great interest .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper should hopefully lead to a complete solution of this problem for random walks with jumps to the eight nearest neighbors .",
