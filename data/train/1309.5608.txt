    "optimal switching is the problem of determining an optimal sequence of stopping times for a switching system , which is often modeled by a stochastic process with several regimes . in this paper , we introduce and solve a new class of optimal switching problems , where the player is allowed to switch at a sequence of random times generated by an exogenous poisson process , and the underlying switching system is governed by an infinite horizon backward stochastic differential equation ( bsde ) system .    as a special case of impulse control problems , optimal switching and its connection with a system of variational inequalities",
    "were extensively studied by bensoussan and lions @xcite in a markovian setting , and later by tang and yong @xcite using the viscosity solution approach .",
    "the problem has drawn renewed attention recently , due to its various applications in economics and finance , ranging from firm s investment ( see @xcite ) to real options ( see @xcite ) and trend following trading ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all applications aim for determining in an optimal way the sequence of stopping times at which the player can enter or exit an economic activity , so optimal switching ( in the two - regime case ) is also called the _ starting and stopping problem _ , or the _ reversible investment problem_. herein , the player could be the manager of a power plant , who needs to decide when to produce electricity ( if the profit generated from operation is high ) , and when to close the power station ( if the profit generated from operation is low ) in an optimal way . for a more recent development of optimal switching",
    ", we refer to pham @xcite and related references therein .    in this paper , we consider a class of optimal switching problems where the player is allowed to switch at a sequence of poisson arrival times instead of any stopping times . the underlying poisson process can be regarded as an exogenous constraint on the player s ability to switch , so it may reflect the liquidity effect , i.e. the poisson process indicates the times at which the underlying system is available to switch . on the other hand ,",
    "the poisson process can also be seen as an information constraint .",
    "the player is allowed to switch at all times , but she is only able to observe the switching system at poisson arrival times . finally , our model can also be seen as a randomized version of a discrete optimal switching problem .    in an optimal stopping time setting , a similar problem was firstly introduced by dupuis and wang @xcite , where they used it to model perpetual american options exercised at exogenous poisson arrival times , followed by lempa @xcite .",
    "recently , liang et al @xcite has established a connection between such kind of optimal stopping at poisson random intervention times and dynamic bank run problems . in this sense ,",
    "our result in section 3 is a generalization of dupuis and wang @xcite , lempa @xcite and liang et al @xcite from optimal stopping to optimal switching .",
    "there are mainly two methods in the existing literature about how to solve optimal switching problems .",
    "one method mainly focuses on obtaining closed form solutions , in order to investigate the structure of switching regions .",
    "for example , brekke and oksendal @xcite and duckworth and zervos obtained the solutions by a verification approach .",
    "ly vath and pham @xcite employed the viscosity solution approach to determine an explicit solution in the two - regime case , which was extended to multi - regime case in @xcite .",
    "bayraktar and egami @xcite obtained an even more general result by making an extensive use of one dimensional diffusions .",
    "notwithstanding , most of the results in this spectrum is based on the assumption that the switching system is one dimensional diffusion ( such as one dimensional geometric brownian motion ) and the time horizon is infinite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the switching system is governed by a more general stochastic process , such as multi - dimensional diffusions or bsdes , it is often a formidable task to determine the structure of switching regions .",
    "in such a situation , the attention more focuses on the characterization of the value function and the optimal switching strategy , either by using a system of variational inequalities as in tang and yong @xcite , or by using a system of reflected bsdes such as in hamadene and jeanblanc @xcite , hamadene and zhang @xcite , and hu and tang @xcite .",
    "numerical solution is therefore also an important aspect in this method ( see carmona and ludkovski @xcite and porchet et al @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "if the underlying switching system is modeled by non - diffusive processes such as markov chains , we refer to bayraktar and ludkovski @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to cover both spectra of the methods to tackle our optimal switching problem . in section 2",
    ", we present a general optimal switching model , where the underlying switching system is governed by an infinite horizon bsde system . for a general introduction of bsdes",
    ", we refer to the seminal paper by pardoux and peng @xcite , and a follow - up survey paper by el karoui et al @xcite .",
    "see also the two monographs by ma and yong @xcite and yong and zhou @xcite with more references therein .",
    "our main result in section 2 is to show that if the underlying switching system follows a `` penalized version '' of infinite horizon bsde system , then the value of the corresponding optimal switching problem is nothing but the solution of this penalized equation ( see theorem [ theorem ] ) .",
    "the basic observation comes from the optimal stopping time representation for one dimensional penalized bsde , firstly discovered by liang @xcite in a finite horizon case . in this paper",
    ", we also prove an infinite horizon version in lemma [ lemma1 ] .",
    "we take the other spectrum of the methods in section 3 , where we work in a markovian setting with one dimensional geometric brownian motion and two regimes .",
    "this simplification enables us to fully describe the structure of switching regions ( see theorem [ theorem2 ] ) .",
    "the basic observation therein is that we can consider the difference of the value functions for the two switching regimes , and then employ the comparison principle for one dimensional equation .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : we present our general optimal switching model in section 2 , and characterize the value of the optimal switching problem and the associated optimal switching strategy by the solution of an infinite horizon bsde system . in section 3 , we work out a specific example in a markovian setting , and give a complete description of the structure of switching regions .",
