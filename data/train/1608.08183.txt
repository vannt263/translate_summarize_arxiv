    "the supertiger ( trans - iron galactic element recorder ) instrument @xcite was flown on a nasa long - duration balloon flight over antarctica for 55 days in the 2012 - 2013 austral summer at altitudes from about 36.6 km to 39.6 km and a mean atmospheric overburden of 4.4 g @xmath4 .",
    "the instrument measured the elemental abundances of galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) nuclei with @xmath5 above @xmath3700 gev nucleon@xmath6 ( at the top of the atmosphere ) .    in this paper",
    "we present analysis of measurements of the elemental composition of  ultra - heavy \" gcrs with atomic number @xmath7 .",
    "these measurements are the first in which each element in the @xmath8 charge range has been measured with single - element resolution and good statistics .    in recent years",
    ", an explanation of gcr origins has emerged based on measurements from the cosmic ray isotope spectrometer ( cris ) @xcite onboard the nasa advanced composition explorer ( ace ) satellite @xcite and from the tiger ( trans - iron galactic element recorder ) balloon - borne instrument @xcite .    in this explanation",
    ", the gcr source material is thought to be a mixture of material from massive stars ( supernova ejecta and stellar wind outflow ) , primarily within ob associations , and normal interstellar medium ( ism ) material with solar system ( ss ) composition .",
    "these nuclei are then accelerated to cosmic - ray energies by supernova shocks .",
    "the possibility of ob association origin of gcr was first discussed by @xcite and later developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "the previously measured composition of cosmic - ray isotopes and elements has been shown to be consistent with gcr origin in a source which is a mixture of @xmath320% material from massive star outflow and supernova ejecta , and @xmath380% material with ss abundances @xcite .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , the combined massive star wind outflow and supernova ejecta will be referred to as massive star material ( msm ) .    observed gcr abundances show that elements that are found in interstellar dust grains ( refractory elements ) are preferentially accelerated compared to those that exist primarily as interstellar gases ( volatile elements ) @xcite .",
    "elemental abundances measured by ace at energies of hundreds of mev nucleon@xmath6 @xcite , tiger at gev nucleon@xmath6 energies @xcite , and cream at tev nucleon@xmath6 energies @xcite show that this enhancement is mass dependent for both refractory and volatile elements , and that the ordering of these elements with atomic mass @xmath9 is greatly improved by comparing gcr source abundances with a mixture of normal ism and msm , rather than normal ism alone ( we note that @xcite explain this mass - dependent trend only for the volatile elements ) .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that the elemental abundances are consistent with a gcr source that consists of a best - fit mixture of 19@xmath2% msm mixed with @xmath381% material with ss abundance , and an acceleration mechanism in which elements found in interstellar dust grains are preferentially accelerated over those found in interstellar gases .",
    "recent @xmath10-ray observations of supernova remnants using the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite and ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope arrays such as hess @xcite , magic @xcite , and veritas @xcite have provided evidence of particle acceleration to very high energies .",
    "moreover , observation of the @xmath11 turn on feature indicates that at least snrs w44 , ic443 , and w51c are accelerating protons @xcite , and all of these are believed to be the remnants of core - collapse supernovae . in addition , gev and tev emission has been observed from acceleration within the 30 dor c superbubble in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "fermi has detected extended emission coinciding with a  cocoon \"- like morphology in the cygnus superbubble @xcite , extending @xmath350 parsecs from the cygnus ob2 association .",
    "tev emission from the cygnus superbubble was also observed by argo - ybj @xcite .",
    "these @xmath10-ray observations lend further support to a model in which ob associations are a significant source of gcrs .",
    "the supertiger instrument @xcite consists of two nearly identical @xmath31 m @xmath122 m modules , each consisting of a suite of seven detectors .",
    "figure [ st_instrument ] shows a schematic side view of one module .",
    "three scintillator detectors measure the differential energy loss @xmath13 within the instrument , which is a function of a particle s charge ( @xmath14 ) and velocity ; two cherenkov detectors , one with an aerogel radiator ( c0 ) , and one with an acrylic radiator ( c1 ) , which give signals that are different functions of @xmath14 and velocity for particles above the cherenkov threshold ; and a scintillating fiber hodoscope ( consisting of two separate x , y planes ) which measures particle trajectory . for one supertiger module , the cherenkov radiators in the aerogel ( c0 ) detector had an index of refraction @xmath15 , while the other module had @xmath15 aerogel in half of the module and @xmath16 aerogel in the other half .",
    "the active area of each module measures approximately 1.16m@xmath172.4 m , and the full geometry factor of both modules combined is @xmath38.3 m@xmath18 sr for particles whose trajectory zenith angle is less than 70 degrees . after accounting for losses due to nuclear interactions within the instrument ,",
    "the  effective \" geometry factor is @xmath193.9 m@xmath18 sr for @xmath20se .",
    "the charge ( @xmath14 ) of each cosmic - ray nucleus detected in the instrument was determined by one of two complementary techniques . at low energies ( above the c1 threshold of @xmath3350 mev nucleon@xmath6 but below the c0 threshold of @xmath32.5 gev nucleon@xmath6 or @xmath33.3 gev nucleon@xmath6 , depending on the half - module the event went through ) , the charge was determined using a combination of signals from the top two scintillator detectors ( s1 and s2 ) and the acrylic ( c1 ) cherenkov detector . at energies above the aerogel ( c0 )",
    "threshold , the charge was determined with a combination of the c1 and c0 detector signals .",
    "this technique was also used to analyze tiger data from the 1997 , 2001 , and 2003 tiger flights @xcite .    for each scintillator and cherenkov detector ,",
    "the signal was taken as the sum of the signals from all its photomultipliers .",
    "this sum was corrected for photomultiplier gain differences , temporal variations , and area nonuniformities using the @xmath21 @xmath0fe nuclei detected during flight to map the detector response . the particle trajectory from the scintillating fiber hodoscope",
    "was used to determine the particle position for the mapping correction .",
    "the trajectory angle @xmath22 with respect to the normal to the detector surface was used to correct for the sec@xmath23 dependence of signal on path length within the detector .",
    "particles that underwent a charge - changing nuclear interaction within the instrument were identified and rejected by requiring agreement to within approximately one charge unit in the s1 scintillator , c1 , and c0 cherenkov detectors for events above the c0 threshold , and in the s1 and s2 scintillator detectors , and the c1 cherenkov detector for events below the c0 threshold .",
    "figure [ c1c0_crossplot ] is a cross plot of c1 vs c0 in which each point represents the signals from the two cherenkov detectors for a single cosmic - ray nucleus ( in this plot , only events and signals from the @xmath15 aerogels are shown ) . for particles with energies above the aerogel cherenkov threshold , the combination of the two cherenkov signals gives a well resolved charge assignment for events to the right of the red line .",
    "the points in figure [ c1c0_crossplot ] to the left of the line with low c0 signals represent events with energies near or below the aerogel cherenkov threshold .",
    "those events are analyzed using the signals from the scintillators and the acrylic cherenkov detector .",
    "figure [ s1c1_crossplot ] is a similar cross plot of signals from the top ( s1 ) scintillator detector vs. the acrylic cherenkov ( c1 ) detector .",
    "the events to the right of the red ( right ) line have energies above the aerogel cherenkov ( c0 ) threshold , and were analyzed using signals from the two cherenkov detectors as described previously .",
    "the events to the left of the left ( blue ) line are particles near or below the acrylic cherenkov ( c1 ) threshold of @xmath3 350 mev nucleon@xmath6 , and are not included in the analysis .",
    "the events between the two lines were selected for analysis . for these lower - energy events , signals from the top two scintillator detectors ( s1 and s2 ) and the acrylic cherenkov ( c1 )",
    "detector were used to assign charge .",
    "the bottom ( s3 ) scintillator detector was used to define a more restrictive data set for the development of these analysis techniques , but was not used in the final analysis .",
    "we fit curves of constant charge to each charge contour on the cross plot , and used those to fit an energy - independent form of the scintillator saturation model of @xcite using the formalism given by @xcite .",
    "the resulting charge histogram was then renormalized so that charge peaks corresponded to their integer charges .",

    "cosmic - ray source abundances were derived from the supertiger top - of - atmosphere abundances using a leaky box propagation model @xcite , which uses total destruction cross sections ( a modified form of those from @xcite ) and partial cross sections from @xcite .",
    "the interstellar propagation results were used as input to a spherically symmetric modulation model based on @xcite , with a modulation level @xmath29 543 mv and a typical top - of - atmosphere energy of @xmath33.1 gev nucleon@xmath6 , to obtain modulated values for comparison with the abundances observed at earth .",

    "in addition , the recent detection of @xmath41fe in cosmic rays ( @xmath41fe is a radioactive primary cosmic ray with half - life 2.6 myr that is primarily synthesized in core - collapse supernovae @xcite ) conclusively shows that recently synthesized material ( within the last few million years ) is accelerated to cosmic - ray energies @xcite .",
    "the most natural place for this to occur is in ob associations .",
    "these observations do not directly tell us where or how the normal ism is injected and accelerated into cosmic rays .",

    "@xmath10-ray observations show that these supernovae accelerate high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "however , additional accelerators are required since an unreasonably large fraction of the supernova energy would be required to power cosmic rays if these were the only source of normal ism acceleration .",
    "since most supernovae are in ob associations , it appears that supernova shocks from stars in ob associations must also be accelerating cosmic rays from the normal ism , perhaps from walls of superbubbles surrounding ob associations and residual ism within the superbubble itself @xcite .",
    "we have presented new supertiger measurements of the elemental abundances of gcr from @xmath0fe to @xmath1zr .",
    "our results support a model of cosmic - ray origin in a source mixture of 19@xmath2% msm and @xmath381% normal ism material with solar system abundances .",
    "this indicates that a significant fraction of gcr acceleration occurs in ob associations .",
    "we also find a preferential acceleration of refractory elements over volatile elements by a factor of between @xmath34 and @xmath34.5 , ordered by atomic mass ( a ) .",
    "both the refractory and volatile elements show a mass - dependent enhancement with similar slopes .",
