    "ultracold gases allow unprecedented experimental control over key parameters of a many - body system @xcite and offer unique opportunities to explore and understand its out - of - equilibrium behavior .",
    "particularly interesting are one - dimensional systems which can be more or less closely approximated by integrable models and , therefore , allow one to study the effects of integrability and deviations from it .",
    "one - dimensional bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite are , in fact , quasi-1d systems in which the transverse motion is frozen out by a very tight confinement . by integrating out the transverse motion in a two - body problem one obtains a 1d delta - function potential for the effective interatomic interaction @xcite . in this manner quasi-1d spinless bosons and spin-1/2",
    "fermions are modelled by the integrable lieb - liniger @xcite and yang - gaudin @xcite hamiltonians respectively .",
    "quantum integrability implies that the @xmath8-body scattering is nondiffractive , i.e. the outgoing momenta of particles are restricted to be only rearrangements of the incoming ones @xcite .",
    "the two - body scattering in 1d is necessarily diffractionless for equal mass particles .",
    "however , already for @xmath9 the nondiffractive rule has nontrivial consequences .",
    "in particular , the probability of reflection and break - up in atom - dimer collisions vanishes independent of the collision energy @xcite .",
    "this manifestly quantum phenomenon , which has never been observed experimentally , is a microscopic analog of the reflectionless scattering of solitons .",
    "small imperfections of a realistic quasi-1d system compared to its idealized integrable counterpart are practically irrelevant as long as we are interested , for example , in the equation of state or thermodynamic quantities . however , the statistics of energy levels , localization of eigenstates , decay of excitations , thermalization , response to an external perturbation , transport , and other dynamical properties are sensitive to deviations from integrability .",
    "_ @xcite have found that virtual excitations of transverse modes are responsible for the dissipative dynamics of dark solitons in a weakly interacting quasi-1d bose gas .",
    "they have shown ( see also @xcite ) that the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom can be accounted for by adding a local three - body interaction term into the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( equivalent in this case to the lieb - liniger model ) .",
    "_ @xcite have numerically solved a purely 1d three - boson problem near a feshbach resonance and found that the integrability is lifted when the two - body coupling constant becomes energy - dependent .    in this paper",
    "we solve the quasi-1d atom - dimer scattering problem by extending the approach of mora _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to the case of finite collision momenta .",
    "in the nearly - integrable limit , @xmath10 , we analytically calculate the scattering amplitudes and find that at a finite collision momentum @xmath11 the leading contributions to the reflection and break - up probabilities are proportional to @xmath12 for fermions and to @xmath13 for bosons .",
    "we show that the diffraction in the fermionic case originates mainly from the effective range corrections to the quasi-1d two - body scattering amplitude .",
    "in contrast , the bosonic result is due to a diffractive scattering of the atom by the transversely excited part of the dimer , consistent with the local three - body potential of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the strong @xmath7-dependence of diffraction suggests a way of creating a system with fixed thermodynamic properties but with a tunable integrability parameter , the fermionic case being more practical due to the higher power in the @xmath7-dependence and , as we also discuss , due to the suppression of inelastic processes .",
    "a four - fold increase of @xmath7 and doubling of @xmath0 does not change the effective 1d model ( the effective coupling constant is unchanged ) , whereas the reflection probability in atom - dimer collisions increases by a factor of 64 in the fermionic case and by a factor of 16 for bosons .",
    "this effect can be verified by colliding clouds of atoms and dimers in a similar but more tunable fashion as the quantum newton s cradle experiment of kinoshita _ et al .",
    "we point out that a quasi-1d two - component @xmath14k mixture close to a zero crossing for the interspecies scattering length is a promising candidate for exploring this and other phenomena that are sensitive to deviations from integrability .",

    "this means that the dissipative dynamics of a dimer immersed in a gas of atoms is dominated by the reflection rather than the break - up . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter is a chemical reaction and its rate can be measured by monitoring the evolution of the population of dimers .",
    "the same holds for the break - up s inverse , the three - body recombination .",
    "the three - body recombination rate determines , for instance , the rate of dimer formation in a super - tonks state  the state of the system with negative coupling constant but without dimers @xcite ( the bosonic super - tonks gas has been recently observed @xcite ) .",
    "the three - body recombination rate constant @xmath235 is readily obtained from @xmath211 by using the principle of detailed balance .",
    "indeed , the three - body recombination rate for a single @xmath5-@xmath5-@xmath15 triple per unit length in the center of mass reference frame equals @xmath236 . here",
    "the factor @xmath237 comes from the fact that the product of densities @xmath238 is twice the number of @xmath5-@xmath5-@xmath15 triples per unit length .",
    "this rate multiplied by the density of unbound states ( of a single triple ) @xmath239 should equal the break - up rate @xmath240 multiplied by the density of atom - dimer states @xmath241 , where @xmath242 . in this manner",
    "we get @xmath243 which should be multiplied by @xmath244 in order to restore the dimensions .",
    "we should mention that the rate constant ( [ recrate ] ) is averaged over a uniform distribution of the initial three - body unbound states in a small energy interval close to @xmath71 , i.e. in the ergodic approximation . for highly nonthermal distributions one should speak about the differential recombination rate of a particular initial unbound state characterized by the asymptotic momenta ( rapidities ) and an auxiliary index related to the parametrization of the @xmath5-@xmath5-@xmath15 wavefunction in the nested bethe ansatz picture @xcite . for",

    "in particular , we believe that eq .",
    "( [ recrate ] ) with @xmath249 gives a good estimate of the recombination rate constant in a degenerate super - tonks gas , provided the fermi energy @xmath250 is much smaller than the dimer binding energy @xmath55 .",
    "remarkable is that in the case @xmath251 the recombination rate constant ( [ recrate ] ) is independent of @xmath55 , i.e. independent of the interatomic interaction strength .",
    "the reason for this is the following . on the one hand we have a nonintegrable perturbation , which acts on three atoms when they are close to each other .",
    "the squared modulus of this perturbation ( relative to the zeroth order terms ) scales as @xmath252 and it does vanish in the integrable case . on the other hand the local three - body correlation function ( probability to find three atoms close together )",
    "is proportional to @xmath253 .",
    "we see that when we multiply these two factors the @xmath55-dependence drops out . in a thermal gas",
    "we have @xmath254 .",
    "in the case of three identical quasi-1d bosons the derivations of secs .  [ sec : stm ] and [ sec : analytic ] are essentially the same .",
    "the modifications are related only to the facts that the bosonic wavefunction is symmetric and that all three atoms interact with each other .",
    "accordingly , the bosonic version of eq .",
    "( [ thefequation ] ) differs from the fermionic one by an extra factor @xmath255 in front of the operators @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "this fact leads to important qualitative differences in between the fermionic and bosonic cases . analyzing different terms in the bosonic version of eq .",
    "( [ theopereq ] ) in the same manner as we did for fermions in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] we see that the @xmath128-term is the leading perturbation : @xmath258 it is of order @xmath259 when acting on the bosonic @xmath102 , whereas @xmath112 is still of order @xmath55 as in the fermionic case .",
    "one can also easily show that the last term in eq .",
    "( [ theopereq ] ) which represents the coupling to higher transverse states is of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath112-term .",
    "therefore , the next to leading order correction is more difficult to obtain compared to the fermionic case .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the leading order correction originating from the @xmath128-term , but before presenting the results let us briefly mention the effect of a narrow feshbach resonance ( cf .",

    "the break - up probability above the break - up threshold ( @xmath267 ) is given by @xmath268 and the three - body recombination rate constant equals @xmath269 as in the fermionic case .",
    "here we also observe the scaling @xmath270 just above the threshold .",
    "this fact is related to the suppression of the local three - body density - density correlation function at low energies in an interacting 1d gas . that the two - body correlator is also suppressed can be seen by looking at the differential rate .",
    "indeed , the recombination rate for three bosons on the length @xmath271 in a state parameterized by the set of rapidities @xmath272 equals @xmath273 where @xmath274 $ ] and we assume that the energy in the center of mass reference frame @xmath275 is much smaller than @xmath55 . we observe that @xmath276 for any pair of rapidities , if they are close to each other , @xmath277 .    due to the fact that the nonintegrable perturbation scales with lower power of @xmath55 compared to the fermionic case the reflection and break - up probabilities , as well as the rate of three - body recombination in the bosonic case contains one power of @xmath55 less .",
    "in particular , the three - body recombination rate actually increases with decreasing @xmath55 ( although @xmath55 should be kept larger than @xmath71 ) .",
    "this counterintuitive phenomenon is explained by the fact that the local three - body correlator is proportional to @xmath253 , whereas the squared modulus of the perturbation is @xmath162 .",
    "let us compare the reflection probability to the probability of relaxation to deeply bound molecular states .",
    "this inelastic process is extremely local .",
    "it takes place at distances @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the van der waals range of the interatomic potential .",
    "the relaxation probability is thus proportional to the probability of finding three atoms at distances of order the oscillator length ( unit in our case ) multiplied by the recombination rate for three atoms confined to a unit 3d volume .",
    "we stay in the near - integrable regime where @xmath280 and @xmath186 .",
    "this gives the following results .    in the fermionic case the probability of relaxation in an atom - dimer collision at the collision energy @xmath165 equals @xmath281 where @xmath282 @xcite . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ relprob ] ) and ( [ reflprob ] ) we see that the relaxation probability is always much smaller than the reflection probability .",
    "one can also show that the recombination to deep molecular states is much slower than the formation of shallow dimers in a gas of unbound fermionic atoms .",
    "namely , for @xmath283 the ratio of the corresponding recombination constants scales as @xmath284 .",
    "the relaxation probability in boson - diboson collisions can be calculated including the prefactor .",
    "indeed , in the zeroth order the wavefunction of an atom and a dimer normalized per ( axial ) length @xmath271 is given by the axial bethe ansatz wavefunction multiplied by the wavefunctions of the radial ground states .",
    "when the three atoms are at distances much smaller than 1 ( the radial oscillator length ) this wavefunction is approximately constant and its modulus square equals @xmath285 .",
    "here we use the normalization corresponding to the `` normal '' laboratory coordinates in which the atom - dimer distance is not rescaled ( we mean the factor @xmath286 in the definition of @xmath44 ) .",
    "the relaxation rate in this case equals @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is the relaxation rate constant for cold thermal bosons in the uniform space .",
    "this quantity has been calculated numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite in the zero - range theory as a function of @xmath7 , the three - body parameter , and the elasticity parameter .",
    "we can write @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is a log - periodic function of @xmath7 bounded from below : @xmath291 . here",
    "@xmath292 and the elasticity parameter is typically @xmath293 .",
    "assuming the case @xmath294 we have @xmath295 we observe that the ratio @xmath296 , which means that the relaxation is the dominant process in boson - diboson collisions unless we find a feshbach resonance with a very low elasticity parameter and/or go to extremely low collision energies .",
    "the above analysis can also be performed for unbound states of three quasi-1d bosons .",
    "namely , the relaxation rate of a bethe ansatz state with rapidities @xmath272 equals @xmath297 , where @xmath298 .",
    "this rate scales as @xmath299 in the same manner as the rate of three - body recombination to the weakly bound state ( [ recratebosons ] ) .",
    "in fact , these rates are related by @xmath300 and we see that the recombination to deep states actually dominates , assuming , for example , the value @xmath301 .",
    "a direct consequence of the relaxation analysis of the previous section is that for bosons , at least in the near - integrable case ( @xmath280 ) , the thermalization due to the local three - body coupling of different bethe ansatz states is likely to be slower than the relaxation and/or recombination to deeply bound molecules .",
    "this means that such a gas is stuck in a nonthermal state during all its lifetime ( which may be long because of the 1d fermionization ) .",
    "in contrast , the relaxation processes in the fermionic case are suppressed and one should be able to observe the diffraction of momenta in atom - dimer collisions or the three - body recombination to a weakly bound state well before the gas decays .",
    "the dynamics of a mobile impurity in a 1d gas is at present a very attractive theme of theoretical ( see @xcite and references therein ) and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "the role of integrability in this problem has been discussed @xcite but is still far from being well understood .",
    "the present paper prepares grounds for studies in this direction .",
    "a quasi-1d @xmath6 dimer immersed in a fermi sea of @xmath5 species is a long - lived system in which , keeping the thermodynamic properties unchanged , one can modify the degree of integrability .",
    "indeed , the thermodynamic quantities depend on the 1d @xmath5-@xmath15 coupling constant , which is proportional to the product of the scattering length @xmath7 and the frequency @xmath18 of the radial confinement @xcite . keeping this product constant",
    "we can still modify the atom - dimer reflection probability in a wide range by using the fact that its scaling with @xmath7 and @xmath18 is drastically different .",
    "namely , at a fixed collision energy we have @xmath302 [ see eq .",
    "( [ reflprob ] ) ] .",
    "having established control over the degree of integrability one can study various physical problems , e.g. whether or not a dimer looses its momentum while moving through a gas of atoms , i.e. whether or not there is a friction force on the dimer . based on our understanding of the atom - dimer scattering problem we can conjecture what happens if one collides a gas of atoms with a gas of dimers in a quasi-1d trap with a weak axial parabolic confinement . in the integrable limit",
    "these two clouds pass through each other without reflection and one expects undamped relative oscillations .",
    "in contrast , as we increase the reflection probability these oscillations become damped and we expect to see none of them when @xmath303 , where @xmath8 is the particle number .",
    "this scenario remains based on the microscopic few - body analysis and we do not exclude nontrivial many - body effects , especially in the degenerate regime .",
    "we think that this problem deserves further experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "note that the limit @xmath304 does not at all correspond to the noninteracting case .",
    "indeed , one can imagine a dimer in a state given by a wavepacket localized in momentum space around @xmath305 and in real space around @xmath306 .",
    "let us assume that it passes an atom which is in a similar state but with @xmath307 .",
    "this picture describes the relative motion of a dimer and an atom at high energies close to the bottom of the axial harmonic trap .",
    "after their collision the dimer wavepacket is centered around @xmath308 , i.e. its trajectory is shifted by @xmath309 ( the atomic wavepacket is then centered at @xmath310 ) . by using the fermionic atom - dimer scattering solution ( [ chi ] ) and the transmission amplitude ( [ t0r0 ] ) with @xmath311 one can show that this shift equals @xmath312 .",
    "for the boson - diboson scattering we have @xmath313 $ ] .",
    "note that if @xmath314 is of order @xmath55 , the shift is proportional to @xmath315 and actually increases with decreasing @xmath187 .",
    "the dimer passes the atom faster than it does in the noninteracting case ( as if the atom - dimer interaction is attractive ) .",
    "if we now assume that there is a gas of @xmath8 atoms with @xmath316 , their effect on the dimer s trajectory and on the frequency of its oscillations is appreciable .",
    "note also that for a longitudinally trapped gas this shift is another source of nonintegrability even in the purely 1d case @xcite .    as a more concrete experimental proposal for investigating the above phenomena",
    "we envision a setup , which is a combination of the fermionic experiment of moritz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on quasi-1d dimers and the bosonic quantum newton s cradle experiment of ref .",
    "namely , one can follow the routine of the former and create a quasi-1d spin mixture ( in our case spin - imbalanced ) of two different hyperfine states of @xmath14k close to a zero crossing for the interspecies scattering length and form molecules by adiabatically decreasing the scattering length from zero to a finite @xmath2 .",
    "one can then separate the dimers from atoms in momentum space by applying a bragg pulse as has been demonstrated by veeravalli _",
    "@xcite in the case of a 3d spin - mixture of @xmath317li .",
    "the transfer of @xmath14k dimers into a state with momentum @xmath318 , where @xmath319  nm , can be done by using counterpropagating bragg beams with the frequency detuning @xmath320  khz .",
    "since the atoms remain at rest the atom - dimer scattering energy then equals @xmath321  khz . assuming the radial confinement frequency @xmath322  khz , which corresponds to the oscillator length @xmath323  nm , this sets @xmath324 in our formulas . for @xmath325",
    "nm the dimer size equals @xmath326  nm , its binding energy @xmath327 ( 10.5  khz in the laboratory units ) , and the reflection probability equals @xmath328 . under these conditions a cloud of , say , @xmath329 dimers will pass through a cloud of the same number of atoms several tens of times without thermalization .",
    "increasing @xmath7 by a factor of 2 leads to @xmath330 and we expect to see only very few oscillations .",

    "the scattering length for two quasi-1d dimers consisting of fermionic atoms has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    ", one can also find the dimer - dimer phase shift at finite collision energies .",
    "however , below the break - up threshold the two - dimer collisions do not lead to momentum diffusion even if the scattering phase shift differs significantly from the zeroth order one .",
    "this is because these are identical particles of the same mass .",
    "the momentum diffusion should appear in three - dimer collisions or in other processes involving more particles ( atoms and/or dimers ) .",
    "of course , these are much more difficult to analyze , but we can neglect these few - dimer diffusion channels compared to the two - body atom - dimer channel when the density of dimers is small or when they are in the tonks regime , i.e. when the probability to find two dimers close together is suppressed .",
    "we have developed a perturbation theory for the quasi-1d three - atom problem in the near - integrable limit .",
    "we have shown that to the leading order the integrability of the @xmath5-@xmath5-@xmath15 fermionic system is broken by the effective range corrections to the two - body coupling constant originating from the virtual transverse excitations .",
    "in contrast , the quasi-1d problem of three bosons can be reduced to the purely 1d problem by adding an additional local three - body term @xcite , the two - body effective range corrections and other effects being of higher order .",
    "we have calculated the atom - dimer reflection , transmission , and break - up probabilities , as well as the three - body recombination rate constants for fermions and bosons as functions of the energy and the interatomic scattering length . at a finite collision energy",
    "@xmath165 the reflection probability is proportional to @xmath12 in the fermionic case and to @xmath13 for bosons .",
    "we have shown that for fermions the rates of relaxation and recombination to deep molecular states are much lower than the rates of ( momentum ) diffusion in the zeroth order bethe ansatz basis , meaning that the integrability breaking processes occur well within the lifetime of the system . in this respect",
    "the fermionic case differs strongly from the bosonic one . for bosons the rate of inelastic relaxation / recombination is comparable or higher than the rates of momentum diffusion",
    "however , the lifetime of the bosonic gas is sufficiently long to study `` zeroth order '' effects of integrability , such as the reflectionless atom - dimer scattering . in spite of the absence of reflection",

    "<S> the leading contributions to the atom - diatom reflection and break - up probabilities are proportional to @xmath3 in the bosonic case and to @xmath4 for the @xmath5-@xmath6 scattering in a two - component fermionic mixture . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by tuning @xmath7 and @xmath0 one can control the `` degree of integrability '' in a quasi-1d atom - dimer mixture in an extremely wide range leaving thermodynamic quantities unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relaxation to deeply bound states in the fermionic ( bosonic ) case is slower ( faster ) than transitions between different bethe ansatz states . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a realistic experiment for detailed studies of the crossover from integrable to nonintegrable dynamics . </S>"
