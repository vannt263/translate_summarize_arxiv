    "it is apparent that the correlations of @xmath37 x - b and @xmath37 x - n with @xmath21 and @xmath23 result from the correlation of @xmath33 x - b@xmath16 , @xmath33 x - b@xmath47 , @xmath33 x - b@xmath39 , @xmath33 x - n@xmath16 , @xmath33 x - n@xmath47 and @xmath33 x - n@xmath39 with @xmath21 and @xmath23 as shown in the correlation coefficients : @xmath48 = 0.543 , @xmath49 = -0.042 , @xmath50 = 0.927 , @xmath51 = 0.812 , @xmath52 = 0.338 , @xmath53 = 0.864 , @xmath54 = -0.436 , @xmath55 = 0.161 , @xmath56 = -0.781 , @xmath57 = -0.808 , @xmath58 = -0.073 , and @xmath59 = -0.629 .",

    "- b - n is very small for the strong repulsion of b@xmath16 by adjacent x. the loss of the bonding balance puts the structure on the saddle with highly degenerated negative curvature on the potential surface .",
    "ga is less electronegative than al , which results in less b@xmath16 repulsion .",
    "the larger occupied space of ga in gabn compared with that of al in albn is attributed to the greater amount of electrons in the inner core of ga than in al .",
    "these differences seem to retain the @xmath0 type frame structure in gabn and make the @xmath38 b - n - b - n value the same as that of mgbn .",
    "the system seems to be stabilized by not only the @xmath77-type bonds between adjacent b and n atoms but also the ga - n@xmath16 bonds .",
    "note that the large @xmath33 x - b@xmath16 value of gabn compared with @xmath33 x - n@xmath16 which is as same as that of @xmath33 x - c@xmath16 of gac@xmath32@xcite .    in fbn and clbn , the f and cl distinctively attract b@xmath16 and repel n@xmath16 atoms .",
    "this is due to the strong electronegativity of x , which attracts the valence electrons of neighbour b@xmath16 , this results in the closing of the x atom s electronic shell .",
    "the f atom attracts electrons more than the cl atom because of its larger electronegativity , and this results in smaller @xmath33 x - b@xmath16 and larger @xmath38 b - n - b - n in fbn . between adjacent b and n atoms , although @xmath77 bonds do not form , the @xmath76 bonds are strengthened . in fbn and clbn , the x - b@xmath16 bonds and @xmath76 bonds between adjacent b and n atoms probably stabilize the crystal structures .",
    "the stabilization of the atomic intercalated bn @xmath0 crystals can be explained by the delicate balance of the bonding .",
    "discriminative stability seems to be realized by the proper atomic radii of x , although the interpretation of thermal stability of the crystal structure is more difficult than in the case of xc@xmath32 systems .",
    "future accumulation of knowledge will elucidate the stability of these systems .",
    "figure 8 shows x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns of the fully optimized crystal structure of the bn , nabn , mgbn , gabn , fbn and clbn .",
    "monochromatic radiation with wave length 1.541   is assumed in these calculations .",
    "as shown in this figure , the compounds have specific xrd peaks at larger @xmath78 than pure bn crystals .",
    "figure 9 shows the electron band structures , dos , and local dos of valence electrons for the atoms composing the @xmath0 type frame and the intercalated atoms in the fully optimized bn , nabn , mgbn , gabn , fbn and clbn crystals . from the bottom energy levels to the upper levels , the angular momentum for the electronic states changes successively in the order of _ s _ , _ p _ and _ d _ character , although every component appears in most of the states . from the bottom energy levels to those around the fermi level , the band structures are similar in these crystals .",
