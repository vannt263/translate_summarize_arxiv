    "it is generally believed , and confirmed by lattice qcd calculations @xcite , that hadronic matter under extreme conditions will form a plasma in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined to individual hadrons and are in both thermal and chemical equilibrium . to search for such a quark - gluon plasma , it is proposed to study collisions of heavy nuclei at extremely high energies .",
    "recent work using models based on perturbative qcd indeed shows that at high energy a dense partonic system can be produced @xcite . though it is not all clear if such partonic systems will reach thermal and chemical equilibrium before hadronization @xcite , the partons , mainly gluons , are certainly in a deconfined state at such high densities @xcite .",
    "many signals could arise from this deconfined state , such as charm quark enhancement @xcite or enhanced photon and dilepton production @xcite .",
    "charm quarks , for example , can not be easily produced during the mixed and hadronic phases of the dense matter , due to their large masses compared to the temperature .",
    "they can be readily produced only during the early stage of the evolution , when partonic degrees of freedom are relevant . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss how pre - equilibrium @xmath0 suppression can be used to probe the early deconfined state of the partonic system and the dynamics governing its evolution toward equilibrium .",
    "@xmath0 suppression due to color screening has been proposed to probe deconfinement @xcite .",
    "this requires that the interactions of @xmath0 with hadrons and deconfined partons are different @xcite .",
    "because of its small size , a heavy quarkonium can probe the short - distance properties of light hadrons .",
    "it is thus possible to make a parton - based calculation of @xmath0-hadron cross section via an operator product expansion method similar to that used in deeply - inelastic lepton - hadron scatterings @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-hadron cross section can be related to the distribution function of gluons inside a hadron .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section near the threshold of the break - up of a @xmath0 is determined by the large @xmath2 behavior of the gluon distribution function , giving rise to a very small break - up cross section at low energies . only at very high energies",
    ", this cross section will reach its asymptotic value of a few mb .",
    "in other words , the dissociation can only occur if the gluon from the light hadron wave function is hard in the @xmath0 s rest frame , i.e. its energy is high enough to overcome the binding energy threshold .",
    "a hadron gas with temperature below 0.5 gev certainly can not provide such energetic gluons to break up the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a slow @xmath0 is very unlikely to be absorbed inside a hadron gas of reasonable temperature @xcite .",
    "this conclusion does not seem to be affected substantially by non - perturbative effects , analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a deconfined partonic system contains much harder gluons which can easily break up a @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a study of the energy dependence of the gluon-@xmath0 inelastic cross section @xcite shows a strong peak just above the break - up threshold of the gluon energy , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the @xmath0 and d meson masses , respectively . in the pre - equilibrium stage ,",
    "i.e. , before the partons have reached equilibrium , the average parton transverse momentum is sufficiently large @xcite to break up a @xmath0 , provided the partons are deconfined .",
    "the dissociation of @xmath0 will continue during the whole equilibration process until the effective temperature drops below a certain value or the beginning of hadronization , whichever takes place first",
    ". therefore measurements of @xmath0 suppression can probe the deconfinement of the early partonic system and shed light on the subsequent equilibration process , provided that possible nuclear effects on the production of @xmath6 pairs and on pre - resonance charmonium states are understood and taken into account .    in the following we will first calculate the thermal gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section at different temperatures and for different @xmath0 transverse momentum .",
    "we then follow the evolution of an initially produced parton gas toward equilibrium and calculate the resulting total survival probability of a @xmath0 and its @xmath7-dependence .",
    "the operator product expansion allows one to express the hadron-@xmath0 inelastic cross section in terms of the convolution of the gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section with the gluon distribution inside the hadron @xcite .",
    "the gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the coupling constant of gluon and @xmath10 quark , @xmath11 the @xmath10 quark mass , and @xmath12 the gluon energy in the @xmath13 rest frame ; its value must be larger than the @xmath0 binding energy @xmath14 . since for the tightly bound ground state of quarkonium the binding force between the heavy quark and antiquark",
    "is well approximated by the one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential , the @xmath1 bound state is hydrogen - like and the coulomb relation holds , @xmath15 the cross section thus can be rewritten as @xmath16    as shown in monte carlo simulations @xcite , the parton density in the early stage of high - energy heavy - ion collisions has an approximate bjorken - type @xcite scaling behavior .",
    "we will only consider @xmath0 suppression in the central rapidity region ( @xmath17 ) . in this case , the @xmath13 will move in the transverse direction with a four - velocity @xmath18 where @xmath19 is defined as the @xmath0 s transverse mass .",
    "a gluon with a four - momentum @xmath20 in the rest frame of the parton gas has an energy @xmath21 in the rest frame of the @xmath0 .",
    "the thermal gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section is then defined as @xmath22 where the gluon distribution in the rest frame of the parton gas is defined as @xmath23 with @xmath24 specifying the deviation of the system from chemical equilibrium .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath25 between the @xmath0 and a gluon is @xmath26 changing the variable to the gluon momentum , @xmath27 , in the rest frame of the @xmath0 , the integral in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28 where @xmath29 one can carry out the integral in the denominator , @xmath30 , and the angular part in the numerator , to get @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33    in order to understand the temperature and @xmath7 dependence of the thermal gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section , we first plot in fig .",
    "1 the cross section @xmath34 of eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) as a function of the gluon energy in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "it decreases strongly toward the threshold and is broadly peaked around @xmath35 gev , with a maximum value of about 3 mb .",
    "low - momentum gluons have neither the resolution to distinguish the heavy constituent quarks nor the energy to excite them to the continuum . on the other end",
    ", high - momentum gluons also have small cross section with a @xmath0 since they can not see the large size .",
    "we can also express the cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy of gluons and the @xmath0 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "one can thus translate the energy dependence in fig .  1 into temperature and @xmath7 dependences after thermal average",
    ", since the thermally averaged @xmath38 is proportional to both @xmath7 and temperature @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the thermally averaged gluon-@xmath0 dissociation cross section as a function of temperature for different values of the @xmath0 s transverse momentum @xmath7 .",
    "we observe the same kind of peak structure , with a decreased maximum value due to the thermal average .",
    "the position of the peak also shifts to smaller values of @xmath39 when @xmath7 is increased , corresponding to a fixed value of the averaged center - of - mass energy @xmath40 .",
    "a similar behavior is expected if one plots the thermal cross section as a function of @xmath7 at different temperatures , as done in fig .",
    "3 . however",
    ", in this case , the peak simply disappears at high enough temperatures , because the averaged @xmath40 will be above the threshold value even for @xmath41 .",
    "these features will have considerable consequences for the survival probability of a @xmath0 in an equilibrating parton gas , especially the @xmath7 dependence .",
    "we should also mention that the use of the bose - einstein distribution function has an effect of about 20% on the thermal cross section , compared to that obtained with a boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "using the thermal cross section just obtained , we can now calculate the survival probability of @xmath13 in an equilibrating parton plasma . in this paper",
    ", we will neglect the transverse expansion and consider only longitudinal expansion .",
    "we will also only consider @xmath0 suppression in the central rapidity region . a @xmath0 produced at point @xmath42 with velocity @xmath43 in the transverse direction will travel a distance @xmath44 in the time interval @xmath45 before it escapes from a gluon gas of transverse extension @xmath46 ; here @xmath47 .",
    "suppose the system evolves in a deconfined state until the temperature drops below a certain value , which we assume to be 200 mev .",
    "the total amount of time the @xmath0 remains inside a deconfined parton gas is the smaller one of the two times @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the life - time of the parton gas .",
    "assume that the initial production rate of the @xmath0 is proportional to the number of binary nucleon - nucleon interactions at impact - parameter @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the survival probability of the @xmath0 averaged over its initial position and direction in an equilibrating parton gas is @xmath52 } }    { \\int d^2r ( r_a^2-r^2 ) } \\ ; , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the gluon number density at a given time @xmath55 .    in eq .  ( [ eq13 ] ) , both the gluon number density @xmath54 and the thermal cross section @xmath56 depend on the temperature , which in turn is a function of time .",
    "in addition , @xmath57 is proportional to gluon fugacity which also evolves with time . to evaluate the survival probability we need to know the entire evolution history of the parton system .",
    "roughly speaking , one can divide this history into two stages : ( 1 ) first there is kinetic thermalization , mainly through elastic scatterings and expansion .",
    "the kinematic separation of free - streaming partons gives us @xmath58 - 0.7 fm/@xmath10 as an estimate of the time when local isotropy in momentum distribution is reached @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the parton gas now further evolves toward chemical equilibrium through parton proliferation and gluon fusion ; it does so until hadronization or freeze - out , whichever happens first .",
    "this evolution can be determined by a set of master rate equations which give us the time dependence of the temperature and fugacities .    in this paper we will not address the question of pre - resonance @xmath0 suppression , which has been discussed and shown to be responsible for the @xmath0 suppression observed in @xmath59 and @xmath60 collisions @xcite .",
    "we will here consider the suppression of fully formed physical @xmath0 states as it should take place if nuclear collision produces dense partonic system .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we characterize the non - equilibrium of the system by gluon and quark fugacities which are less than unity .",
    "the dominant reactions leading to chemical equilibrium are assumed to be the following two processes : @xmath61 assuming that elastic parton scatterings are sufficiently rapid to maintain local thermal equilibrium , the evolution of the parton densities can be given by the master rate equations . combining these master equations together with one - dimensional hydrodynamic equation",
    ", one can get the following set of equations @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the density and velocity weighted reaction rates @xmath67 can be found in refs .",
    "after taking into account parton screening @xcite and landau - pomeranchuck - migdal effect in induced gluon radiation @xcite , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are found to be functions of only @xmath70 . solving the above rate equations as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds that the parton gas cools considerably faster than predicted by bjorken s scaling solution @xmath71 = const . ) , because the production of additional partons approaching the chemical equilibrium state consumes an appreciable amount of energy .",
    "the accelerated cooling , in turn , slows down the chemical equilibration process . for the initial conditions given by hijing monte carlo simulations @xcite , at rhic energy the parton system can hardly reach its equilibrium state , since the effective temperature here drops below @xmath72 mev in a time of some 1 - 2 fm/@xmath10 . at lhc energy",
    ", however , the parton gas comes very close to equilibrium , since the system may exist in a deconfined state for as long as 4 - 5 fm/@xmath10 . in the following",
    "we will use the numerical results for the time evolution of the temperature and fugacities obtained from the above master equations to calculate the survival probability of a @xmath0 in such an equilibrating parton system .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) are the @xmath0 survival probabilities in the deconfined and equilibrating parton plasma at rhic and lhc energies with initial conditions given by hijing monte carlo simulations @xcite , denoted as set 1 in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we find that there is stronger @xmath0 suppression at lhc than at rhic energy , due both to the higher initial parton densities and longer life - time of the parton plasma .",
    "the increase of the survival probabilities with @xmath0 s transverse momentum is a consequence of the decrease of the thermal cross section with increasing @xmath7 at high temperatures , as shown in fig .  3 , and the shorter time spent by a higher-@xmath7 @xmath0 inside the parton plasma , an effect first considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 dissociation during the late stage of the evolution should have a peak and increase a little with @xmath7 when the temperature drops below 0.3 gev , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . this behavior flattens the total survival probability at small values of @xmath7 when we integrate over the entire history of the evolution from high initial temperatures . for a parton system with a low initial temperature ( below 300 mev )",
    ", the @xmath7 dependence of the survival probability should be even flatter .",
    "one can therefore use the @xmath7 dependence to shed light on the initial temperature and the evolution history of the system .    to demonstrate the effects of the chemical non - equilibrium in the initial system",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "4(b ) the survival probabilities in an ideal parton gas with the same initial temperatures as before , but with full chemical equilibrium ( unit initial fugacities ) . in this case",
    ", the temperature simply decreases like @xmath73 .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 is now much more suppressed than in the case of an equilibrating parton plasma , because of both the higher parton density and the longer life time of the system .    since there is considerable uncertainty in the estimate of the initial parton production by hijing monte carlo simulations , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we would like to test the sensitivity of @xmath0 suppression to this .",
    "we therefore multiply initial parton number densities by a factor of 4 , thus increasing initial parton fugacities .",
    "we denote such initial conditions as set 2 in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "if the uncertainties in initial conditions are caused by the soft parton production from the color mean fields , the initial effective temperature will decrease .",
    "therefore , we can alternatively increase the initial parton density by a factor of 4 and at the same time decrease @xmath74 to 0.4 and 0.72 gev at rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "this leads to higher initial fugacities , listed as set 3 in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the corresponding survival probabilities calculated with these two sets of initial conditions are shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the @xmath0 suppression is much stronger if the initial parton densities are higher . comparing the solid and dashed lines",
    ", however , shows that the @xmath0 suppression is less sensitive to the variation of the initial temperature and fugacities as far as the parton densities are fixed .",
    "to summarize , we have used the cross section of @xmath13 dissociation by gluons to calculate the @xmath0 suppression in an equilibrating parton gas produced in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the large average momentum in the hot gluon gas enables gluons to break up the @xmath0 , while hadron matter at reasonable temperature does not provide sufficiently hard gluons .",
    "we find a substantial @xmath0 suppression in such a non - equilibrium partonic medium ; however , it is smaller than that in a fully equilibrated parton plasma . in particular , in an equilibrating plasma the behavior of the @xmath0-gluon cross section at high gluon momenta reduces the @xmath0 suppression at large @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 dissociation during the equilibration of the parton plasma , there are other possible sources of suppression for the actually observed @xmath0 s .",
    "as already noted , nuclear modifications of the @xmath6 production process e.g. , through modified gluon distributions in a nucleus @xcite , multiple scattering accompanied by energy loss @xcite , or a suppression of the nascent @xmath0 before it forms an actual physical resonance @xcite must be taken into account .",
    "such effects would cause @xmath0 suppression in addition to what we have obtained from the equilibrating parton plasma and modify the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 suppression @xcite .",
    "moreover , interactions between gluons and @xmath75 bound states before the kinetic thermalization of the partons could also lead to a substantial @xmath0 suppression ; this would depend on the time needed to achieve local momentum isotropy . on the other hand , gluon fusion could also result in @xmath0 production during the evolution of the parton system , similar to the enhancement of open charm .",
    "although studies of pre - equilibrium open charm production indicate @xcite that @xmath0 production during the parton evolution is not significant compared to primary production , a consistent study of @xmath0 suppression should include the pre - equilibrium production in a form of a master rate equation .",
