    "outside the solar circle , the perseus arm is the first spiral arm crossed by galactic plane sight - lines .",
    "it contains a number of well - studied star - forming clouds ( e.g. w3 , w4 and w5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) set among stretches of relatively modest star - forming activity .",
    "the shape and characteristics of the perseus arm have been examined in several works over the years , using different tracers ranging from co @xcite through to ob associations @xcite .",
    "a longstanding issue for these studies  particularly in the second quadrant of the milky way @xmath8  has been the evidence for peculiar motions of stellar tracers and clouds , departing from the mean rotation law , which necessarily challenge kinematic distance determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , distances to star forming regions within the perseus and other arms have begun to be measured reliably via methanol and oh maser trigonometric parallaxes , known to milli - arcsec precision . of special significance to the present study",
    "is the @xcite result for w3oh ( @xmath9 ) in the perseus arm , from which a distance of 1.95 @xmath10 0.04  kpc was obtained .",
    "this represented a shortening of scale that has now been absorbed within the new consensus as may be found in the works of @xcite and @xcite .    beyond the perseus arm , also within the second quadrant",
    ", there is some evidence accumulating in favour of the existence of a further spiral arm , which is referred to as either the outer or cygnus arm .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have identified stellar and gaseous tracers , that lend support to this outer structure .",
    "nevertheless , its location and true character remains elusive because of present limits on the quantity of tracers available combined with the continuing need to make significant use of kinematic distances .",
    "for the outer arm , a distance between 5",
    " 6  kpc , is quoted from fits of logarithmic spirals to the relevant tracers @xcite .",
    "@xcite also estimated a distance range running from 5 to 6  kpc , via photometric parallaxes of a sample of bright ob stars .",
    "the best single measurement to date is the maser parallax obtained for wb89 - 437 by @xcite , giving a distance of 6.0@xmath100.2  kpc . at these distances",
    ", the outer arm straddles the zone of galacto - centric radii ( @xmath11  kpc ) in which the stellar disc truncates @xcite or , as has now become clear , presents a pronounced shortening of exponential length scale @xcite .",
    "so whilst the reality of at least the perseus arm is beyond doubt , a settled picture of the galactic plane in the second quadrant is yet to emerge . in this paper",
    ", we add to the pool of available tracers a first sample of reddened classical be ( cbe ) stars , reaching down to @xmath12 , that is drawn from the int / wfc photometric h@xmath13 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas )  @xcite and in particular the catalogue of @xmath4 emission line sources provided in @xcite . in so doing we point towards the gain to be had from more comprehensive exploitation of these newly available emission line objects .",
    "cbe stars are mainly early b - type stars of luminosity class v - iii that are on the main - sequence ( ms ) or moving off it @xcite",
    ". they are frequently observed in young open clusters ( @xmath14  myr ) @xcite , and their spectra exhibit allowed transitions in emission ( mainly lower excitation balmer lines ) .",
    "earlier cbe stars at least have not had time to move far from their birth places but , equally , they are unlikely to be heavily embedded in their parental clouds .",
    "in addition they are intrinsically bright , with absolute magnitudes ranging from @xmath15 down to @xmath16 , enabling their detection at great distances across the galactic plane . in combination , these attributes make them highly suitable targets for studying spiral arm structure .",
    "we focus our study in a patch of sky , spanning @xmath17 , that covers the perseus arm in the galactic longitude range @xmath18 and latitude band @xmath19 .",
    "the positive offset of the chosen latitude band ensures we capture the displacement of the galactic mid - plane caused by warping  a phenomenon that is evident both from maps of h  i and dust emission @xcite and from the distribution of star forming complexes @xcite .",
    "the selected longitude range encompasses the much - studied star forming complex w3/w4/w5 , along with a more quiescent stretch of the perseus arm .",
    "we present the results of a two - stage spectroscopic follow - up programme .",
    "the process begins with low resolution spectroscopy of @xmath7370 photometrically - selected candidate emission line objects  the brighter portion of a total population in this part of the plane , of more than 560 candidate emission line stars ( section  [ chap2 ] ) .",
    "this sample is further reduced to a set of 67 stars , for which we have medium - resolution spectra that ultimately serve to confirm the selected objects are nearly all luminous cbe stars . in section  [ chap3 ] ,",
    "we determine spectral types and colour excesses for this sample and then estimate the contribution to the colour excess that originates in the circumstellar disc ( that adds on to the interstellar component ) , which is observed toward each star . using iphas survey data , we compare the resultant spectroscopic parallaxes with distances to similarly - reddened non - emission line a / f stars within a few arcminutes of each cbe star , in order to set constraints on luminosity class .",
    "this is described in section  [ chap4 ] , where we also present the spatial distribution of cbe stars that we obtain .",
    "some of the sample appear to be very distant ( @xmath20  kpc ) early - type cbe stars .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion that includes consideration of how the derived spatial distribution compares with simple simulations , accounting for typical errors , that place the stars either within the spiral arms only , or distributes them smoothly according to an exponential stellar density profile .",
    "we also consider how the derived cbe star colour excesses compare with total integrated values from the map of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ) .",
    "candidate emission line stars in the specified perseus arm region ( galactic longitude range @xmath18 , latitude range @xmath19 ) were identified from the @xcite catalogue as potential spectroscopy targets .",
    "all such objects are point sources that exhibit a clear @xmath21 excess , with respect to main - sequence stars in the @xmath22 colour - colour diagram : 560 such candidates fall within the chosen sky area , in the magnitude range @xmath23 .",
    "to enable spectroscopic follow - up on small to mid - sized telescopes , we restricted this sample to objects brighter than @xmath24 , i.e. 354 of them . to this list",
    ", we then added a further @xmath25 emission - line candidates ( @xmath26 ) derived from iphas photometry that was not available at the time the @xcite catalogue was compiled .",
    "observations of most of this moderately bright sample were collected between 2005 and 2011 at the 1.5 m fred laurence whipple observatory ( flwo ) tillinghast telescope using the fast spectrograph @xcite .",
    "all in all , 370 objects were observed .",
    "the resolution of the spectra obtained was @xmath27   , and the data span the wavelength range 3500  7500   .",
    "the spectra from this facility were obtained in queue mode , and pipeline - processed at the telescope data center at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory .",
    "they were delivered without relative flux calibration .",
    "an approximate calibration was applied to them subsequently , using a number of spectrophotometric standards taken from the flwo-1.5m / fast archive .    fig .",

    "[ map ] shows the spatial distribution of the observed sample of targets . in both figures we pick out , in advance of discussion , the colours and positions of the 67 cbe stars for which we have acquired mid - resolution spectra .              .",

    "the blue dot - dashed lines are the reddening vectors from @xcite .",

    "all the plotted curves are converted to the 2mass system , adopting relationships defined in @xcite.[2mass ] typical error bars are in the upper left corner of the diagram . ]",
    "the flwo-1.5m / fast observations have allowed us to cover a large part of the potential target list for this region of sky , in order to confirm / reject the emission line star status of the candidates , confirming a high success rate for iphas candidate emitter selection . the combination of achieved signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and spectral resolution is sufficient for a first - pass coarse typing , allowing early - type emission line stars to be clearly distinguished from late - type .",
    "the identification of suitable targets for further evaluation via intermediate resolution spectroscopy , relied on two features that are frequently shared with other classes of emission line star and so must be appraised carefully :    1 .   the bright @xmath4 emission , originating in the circumstellar environment of classical be stars @xcite , which is now known to originate from a disc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "similarly strong @xmath30 emission is also observed both in low - mass ysos , or classical t - tauri stars ( ctts ) @xcite , and in intermediate - mass ones , or herbig  ae / be stars ( haebe ) @xcite .",
    "very nearly all the confirmed emission line stars are either cbe stars or ysos . a property that can provide",
    "some discrimination is the presence / absence of nebular forbidden line emission .",
    "cbe - star spectra do not in general present with forbidden line emission .",
    "any objects presenting such features are not included in the sample discussed here .",
    "a critical diagnostic separating cbe from candidate ysos is accessed at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of optically - visible ysos present a nir colour excess due to thermal emission from a circumstellar disc .",
    "the scale of the excess depends on their evolutionary stage and type of object ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but here the important point is that , by comparison with that of ysos , the nir excess characteristic of cbe stars ( due to circumstellar free - free emission ) is very much weaker .",
    "we therefore supplemented iphas photometry and our low - resolution spectroscopy with 2mass photometry @xcite in order to help distinguish likely cbe stars from ysos ( and other emission line stars ) .",
    "we required definite detections in all three 2mass bands ( quality flags a , b or c ) as minimum ( i.e. 367 objects ) .",
    "then the measured @xmath31 , @xmath32 colours must place the object in the domain close to or redward of the line traced by non - emission early type stars as they redden .",
    "there is some expectation that as @xmath32 grows , ysos or similar objects with strong nir excesses may begin to mix in with the cbe stars .",
    "our final sample of 67 cbe stars is drawn from those with nir colours bluer than @xmath33 .",
    "this removes from consideration altogether , objects that may be red enough in @xmath31 to be lightly - reddened cttss .",
    "[ 2mass ] shows the 2mass colour - colour diagram of all potential targets : triangles distinguish objects with only low - resolution spectra and squares those deemed to be probable cbe stars that were selected for further spectroscopy at intermediate spectral resolution .",
    "the number of objects that could have satisfied all our selection criteria is 230 ( out of 367 ) .",
    "the iphas and 2mass photometry for the sample of 67 objects scrutinised here is collected into table  [ photometry ] .",
    "our final selection exhibits the same broad range of reddenings , @xmath34 present in the total available sample : accordingly these objects nir colours are shifted parallel to the blue dot - dashed lines drawn in fig .",
    "[ 2mass ] that are themselves parallel to the reddening vector . to underline this point we have drawn in fig .",
    "[ 2mass ] , the @xmath29 be - star selection region presented in the analysis of @xcite and note that most of the target stars fall within it . that the reddening is significant",
    "is consistent with the presence of well - developed diffuse interstellar bands ( dib ) in the spectra of the majority of our selected targets .",
    "next , in section  [ chap2.3 ] , we describe our intermediate - resolution spectroscopy of this reduced sample and the reduction techniques that we adopted .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]    4 .",
    "we estimate the distance to the group of stars selected from the iphas colour - magnitude diagram by finding the ms track that fits them best ( dashed black curve in each of the right - hand panels ) . in the fitting procedure ,",
    "the selected stars are weighted according to their photometric errors and with a sigmoid function computed as described by @xcite .",
    "the latter limits the bias to too short a distance that is otherwise induced by stars just brighter than the magnitude limit . furthermore , since the iphas colours roughly signal spectral type , and early - a candidates are the least ambiguous , extra weight was awarded to them ( 5 times that of other later - type stars ) .",
    "we also applied a 3-@xmath35 cut to bright ( redder ) outliers and recomputed the fit , in order to inhibit shortening of the distance due to interloping giant stars . the ms absolute magnitude scale applied to the selected a and f stars",
    "is taken from @xcite the distances estimated this way are reported in table  [ t : distances ] . in view of the modest samples sizes involved , these distances are indicative only and certainly approximate , and used here solely as a guide to likely luminosity class .",
    "5 .   a luminosity class ( either v , iv or iii , given in the final column of table  [ t : distances ] )",
    "is then assigned to each cbe star according to the option falling closest to the rough distance estimate from ms - fitting . in fig .",
    "[ ms - fit ] , the ms loci consistent with class v , iv and iii luminosity - class assignments for the cbe star are plotted in the colour - magnitude diagrams . where the distance estimate obtained from the candidate a ",
    "f stars is lower than the class v spectroscopic parallax , @xmath36 , the ( longer ) distance compatible with class v is adopted .        as a partial test of this method of estimation ,",
    "we have applied it to photometric selections of a / f stars in the well - studied clusters , ngc  637 and ngc  663 . in the case of ngc  637",
    ", @xcite obtained @xmath37  kpc from conventional photometric methods  our shorthand method gives 2.0  kpc .",
    "for ngc  663 , we obtain a / f distances for three different sightlines crossing the cluster ( to cbe stars for which we have only flwo-1.5m / fast spectra ) that are respectively 2.2 , 2.5 , and 2.8  kpc .",
    "these compare satisfactorily with the literature measure of @xmath38  kpc @xcite for this cluster .",
    "nevertheless the method carries two potential biases towards low estimates that results in 16 a / f star distances that are much lower than the class v cbe - star distance .",
    "first , it rests on trying to identify associated main - sequence a / f stars ",
    "although we attempt to eliminate interloping giants ( improbable companions for cbe stars ) , this may not always be successful .",
    "second , where the cbe star is relatively early - type ( b2 - 4 ) and very distant , the reddening may be comparable with the total galactic reddening with the result that the detected a / f stars may actually be foreground and unassociated .",
    "the first of these biases may result in inappropriate assignment to class v , but the second most likely fails safe ( in 9 of the 16 cases ) in leaving these objects as dwarfs at distances of between 8 and 12 kpc . given these issues",
    ", we do not regard these estimates as providing more than an ad hoc sorting tool .",
    "the pattern emerging from the luminosity class assignments is similar to that among the sample of classical be stars presented by @xcite : 42 are assigned to class v ( cf 36 , on scaling to this older result ) , while 12 and 9 are placed into classes iv and iii respectively ( cf expectations of 1415 , and 13 ) .",
    "that there are more dwarfs may either be a consequence of the much fainter apparent magnitude range our sample is drawn from , or due to the noted bias in the method of assignment .      in fig .",
    "[ arms_distances_phot ] we plot all the stars at the distance corresponding to their assigned luminosity class against galactic longitude , marking on the diagram the expected locations of the perseus and outer arms .",
    "the four stars for which we do not have spectroscopic @xmath4 observations are not included in this plot .",
    "the emergent picture presented by these 63 stars is certainly not one of pronounced clustering picking out the spiral arms in the distance - longitude plot .",
    "closest to this possible reality is seen at longitude @xmath7135 where there is a group of six stars near the star - forming complexes w3/w4/w5 , well in front of another group of stars , sitting closer to the oh maser in the outer arm .",
    "elsewhere there is no sign of such orderly behaviour .",
    "the casual impression is of a scattered , more or less random , distribution of emission line stars .    in the sample ,",
    "no cbe star is closer than @xmath39  kpc ( #  56 ) or more distant than @xmath40  kpc ( #  39 ) .",
    "this is mainly a reflection of the magnitude limits ( @xmath41 ) placed on the sample of cbe stars . at the bright end @xmath42 ,",
    "a main sequence dwarf with a median spectral type ( b5 ) , with a median reddening of @xmath43 , just falls within the sample at the minimum distance of @xmath44  kpc . for b3v this estimate of the minimum rises to 2.9  kpc , consistent with the brightest object ( # 45 ) in the sample , that happens to be a b3 star , being assigned a distance of 2.8  kpc ( its reddening is a little above the median value ) .",
    "for the latest spectral types present in the sample , the near distance limit drops as low as 1 to 1.5  kpc . that we do not find any in the allowed range between 1 and 2 kpc is perhaps because the reddening only rises up to and through the median for the distribution once the perseus arm is well and truly entered at @xmath72  kpc .",
    "the upper distance limit can in principle be expected to be more variable , following to an extent the variation of the integrated galactic reddening with sightline : for most of the cbe sample the maximum possible @xmath45 varies from @xmath72 up to @xmath75 .",
    "but our selection has , for practical observational reasons , avoided the most heavily reddened objects and sightlines ( the maximum @xmath45 in the sample is 4 ) .",
    "on deploying the median spectral type and reddening for the sample , again  but this time combining them with the absolute magnitude appropriate to luminosity class iii  we would expect a faint magnitude limit of @xmath46 to translate to a maximum heliocentric distance of @xmath716  kpc ( dropping to 1012  kpc for the latest b sub - types ) .",
    "the actual outcome is that the most distant / faintest objects in the sample are b3 - 4ve objects inferred to be 1012  kpc away .",
    "the objects assigned to luminosity class iii are , in contrast , mostly relatively bright and/or relatively heavily reddened , bringing all but one of them in to distances closer than 10  kpc .",
    "so whilst there is not a simple upper limiting distance to the observed window , there is reason to assume that the range from 3 to 8  kpc is well captured by our sample at all sub - types ",
    "so if cbe stars are preferentially located in the outer arm at 5 to 6  kpc , it would be likely to be evident .",
    "[ arms_distances_phot ] does not support this .",
    "we return to this below in the discussion .",
    "the most distant early - type dwarf stars at heliocentric distances of 1011  kpc are 1617  kpc away from the galactic centre .",
    "this places them significantly outside the disc truncation radius estimated by @xcite , and since re - examined by @xcite .",
    "although dependent in detail on how the stellar density profile steepens at these large galactocentric radii , we would not expect a selection of cbe stars fainter than @xmath47 to yield too many more - distant objects  instead , it would more likely add in stars that are later in spectral type , more reddened , or both .",
    "indeed the number of early - type stars that are already known at such a large galactocentric radii is very small . in @xcite ,",
    "just 14 out of the 80 studied b - type stars , between @xmath48  kpc , are found at distances larger than @xmath49  kpc .",
    "in this section , we identify the main insights provided by our sample of 67 cbe stars , identifying robust outcomes and possible biases . regarding the latter , we analyse the impact that choices of reddening law and absolute magnitude scale , and the method of correction for circumstellar disc fraction , may have had on the distance estimates .",
    "finally , we compare ( i ) the inferred cumulative distribution of object distances with that expected of a regularly declining disc stellar density profile , ( ii ) the measured corrected colour excesses , @xmath50 , with the integrated colour excesses from .",
    "we now turn to the individual biases that may affect the distances inferred for our sample .      in section  [ chap4.1 ] , we pointed out that our chosen absolute magnitude scale is the faintest among those to be found in current literature .",
    "for example the ms magnitudes we have adopted are , on average , 0.4 - 0.6  mag fainter than others reported in literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the early and late - b types , whilst they are better aligned for mid - b stars . had we favoured a brighter absolute magnitude scale , we should expect to obtain distances up to 25  % larger than those we have tabulated .",
    "however it is worth noting that we found that the great majority of our class v spectroscopic parallaxes gave larger values than those crudely inferred from nearby candidate a / f stars ( section  [ chap4.2 ] and table  [ t : distances ] ) .",
    "this may turn out to be part of the explanation for the attribution of a somewhat higher proportion of the sample to class v , based on the existing absolute magnitude scale , relative to the earlier sample of @xcite .",
    "the deduced distance to each cbe star is necessarily strongly dependent on adopted luminosity class . here ,",
    "a rough constraint on luminosity class has come from estimating the distances to probable main - sequence a and f stars of comparable reddening within a few arcminutes angular separation ( section  [ chap4.2 ] ) . where the luminosity assignment is wrong by one class",
    ", the distance will be over or under - estimated by 30 %  a large uncertainty . to do better ,",
    "a robust spectroscopic indicator is needed .",
    "one possibility under investigation presently is to adapt the barbier - chalonge - divan ( bcd ) method that evaluates the properties of the balmer limit ( fabregat et al , in preparation ) to the circumstances of the entire flwo-1.5m / fast dataset .",
    "this will incorporate the subset of stars that we have described here in detail . for the time being",
    "it is reassuring that the spread of this smaller sample across luminosity class is not radically different from that found by @xcite .    at the present time",
    ", the uncertainty in absolute magnitude is the major contribution to the error budget for the distance determinations .",
    "the errors are large enough that attention must be paid to an error - sensitive statistical bias that was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is dependent on the gradient in space density and its impact is quantified in section  [ chap5.2 ] where we discuss the spatial distribution of the sample .",
    "we based our disc fraction and circumstellar excess estimates using the commonly adopted method proposed by @xcite , in which the measured @xmath51 is corrected downwards using a scaling to the @xmath4 emission equivalent width . as we already noticed in sec.[chap3.3 ] , we observed 5 stars with @xmath52   , that lie outside the range in which eq.[dachs : a ] and [ dachs : b ] were defined .",
    "this makes their @xmath53 determination more uncertain .",
    "furthermore , both of @xcite equations are based on quite scattered data .    for the most extreme emitter in our sample ( #  26 , with @xmath54   ) , a variation of @xmath55 twice as large as the 0.02 uncertainty that we considered in the error propagation would move the star by @xmath56% around its measured distance , after taking into account the corresponding @xmath53 and @xmath57 changes .",
    "the estimate of @xmath53 also has an effect on the identification of the preferred luminosity class , in that a different @xmath58 value alters the selection of stars in the colour - colour diagrams of sec.[chap4.2 ] and , hence , the a / f star fits . in short ,",
    "the role of the disc fraction and the uncertainties in its estimation is complex .",
    "it is fortunate that for most of the sample its impact is not likely to be very large      as we mentioned in section  [ chap3.2 ] a different choice of @xmath59 would affect the distance estimates , although the measured colour excesses would not change too much since the shape of the curve does not change significantly if @xmath59 is altered by a few tenths . a smaller / larger @xmath59 produces lower / higher reddening for a given colour excess , and hence a larger / smaller inferred spectroscopic parallax .",
    "a study of the shape of reddening laws across much of the galactic plane was undertaken by @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , this work would seem to imply a lower @xmath59 of @xmath60 within the region delimited by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however this is based only on three bright b stars , that apparently lie on the near side of the perseus arm .",
    "since the majority of our stars are appreciably more distant than 2  kpc , there is no strong incentive yet to stray from the widely accepted mean law ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "had we preferred @xmath64 , the derived spectroscopic parallaxes would be about @xmath65 larger than specified here .",
    "conversely , raising @xmath59 above the typical galactic value would shorten the distance scale .",
    "if a change in either sense is necessary , it is more likely that @xmath66 should be increased .      in this part of the galactic plane ( @xmath0 and @xmath67 ) , galactic models @xcite place the perseus arm at @xmath68  kpc and the outer arm at @xmath69  kpc , consistent with measured maser parallaxes @xcite .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ arms_distances_phot ] the distances to 63 of the 67 objects presented in this paper as a function of galactic longitude , leaving out 4 objects for which we do not have the h@xmath13 emission equivalent width data needed to correct the measured reddenings for circumstellar emission , and one further star that is more likely to be a yso . neither this figure , nor the binned histogram distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ histogram_distances : a ] , displays a pronounced clustering consistent with these mooted spiral arm locations .",
    "we reconsider the distribution collapsed into a cumulative form that permits an analysis free of binning effects ( fig .",
    "[ histogram_distances : b ] ) .",
    "the magenta curve shown in it is the cumulative distribution as a function of distance obtained when all cbe stars are classified as dwarfs , while the blue curve is the result obtained on assigning luminosity classes as given in table  [ t : distances ] .",
    "if the cbe stars were preferentially located in the perseus and outer arms , we might expect to see steepenings of the cumulative distribution curve ( cdc ) in the distance ranges associated with the arms ( picked out in the figure ) .    to test this expectation , we compare our result with simulated , appropriately randomised cdcs computed using two contrasting models : ( i ) a stellar density gradient consistent with the average properties of the outer galactic disc ; ( ii ) a simple spiral arm model in which it is assumed the cbe stars are contained within them . to obtain such cdcs , in the first case we set up a distribution function to be obeyed by the 63 stars that deploys the length scales and disc truncation radius derived by @xcite :",
    "essentially the exponential length scale out to @xmath70  kpc is @xmath71 kpc , and thereafter it shortens to @xmath72  kpc . in the second case ,",
    "we distribute the stars along the line - of - sight according to two boxcar functions , whose limits are defined by the allowed range of distances for the perseus and outer arms given in @xcite  the relative weight of the two spiral arms is set to match the exponential decay of case ( i ) .",
    "both distributions are weighted with a @xmath73 term , to reproduce the conical volume sample function . to emulate the effect of error in the real data , the randomly selected distances of stars in each simulation",
    "are scattered according to gaussian noise , that is modelled as a linear function of distance , fit to the real errors .",
    "10000 monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were performed for each type of model .",
    "the starting distance of the two models , set to roughly match the observational selection , does influence the outcome .",
    "but we find that placing it anywhere between 1 and 2  kpc does not affect the median cdc produced by the mc simulations . because of the steep decline in stellar density outside the truncation radius , the end point is not influential .",
    "we plot both comparison cdcs in fig .",
    "[ histogram_distances : b ] , in the form of contours defining the 1@xmath35 , 2@xmath35 , and 3@xmath35 confidence limits derived from the two families of mc simulations .",
    "a direct visual comparison between the cdc of the 63 cbe stars ( blue curve ) and the contours generated with the simulations , indicates that the observations incorporating luminosity class constraints ( blue curve ) do not clearly prefer either model yet .",
    "however , the cdc obtained with all the stars classified as dwarfs ( magenta curve ) is exposed as implausible , since too many stars are assigned to the perseus arm .",
    "this is on top of the improbability that all objects in the cbe sample would be dwarfs , given the known properties of these stars .",
    "we have performed k - s tests comparing the observed cumulative functions with the median of the simulated data , from both models . for the magenta curve ( all stars being dwarfs ) , we obtain @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; due to the large d values and the small p - values , we can reject the hypothesis that the magenta distribution is consistent with either models . on the other hand , for the blue curve we measure @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this case",
    "the numerical outcome is inconclusive , rather than negative  our cbe sample may be compatible with either model , and it is clear that reduced errors , combined perhaps with a larger sample would be needed for a more decisive outcome .    furthermore , the astrophysical point that @xmath82% of the stars in our sample are b5 or later in spectral type should not be overlooked : if the be phenomenon is due to evolutionary structural changes @xcite , these later - type stars would be less likely to have remained within the spiral arms at an age approaching 50  myr or more , than their earlier - type cousins .",
    "ideally , a larger sample restricted to early - type be stars , if feasible , would supply the best test for the spiral arm structure of the galaxy .",
    "we note that the statistical bias of the type first set out by @xcite and implemented by @xcite is present here .",
    "since the error model adopted for the mc simulations is based on the uncertainties affecting the real data , the impact of the bias can be gauged numerically just by comparing the error - free model cdc with its form when the error is included .",
    "we find , in accordance with expectation , that the shorter distances in the sample are under - estimated , and the longest are over - estimated .",
    "the effect is most severe at the longest distances ( @xmath83  kpc ) where the over - estimation may approach 1 kpc . at @xmath68  kpc ,",
    "the under - estimation is in the region of 100 - 200 pc .",
    "since our mc simulation already takes into account this bias , the outcome of the k - s test reported above also accounts for it .",
    "before now , by means of ob - star spectroscopic parallaxes derived from a brighter sample ( @xmath84 ) of stars than here , @xcite identified a number of ob stars at @xmath85  kpc for @xmath86 and @xmath87    6  kpc for @xmath88",
    "  @xmath89 .",
    "thanks to the high quality of their spectroscopic data , the authors felt able to claim spectral types had been determined to a precision better than @xmath6 subtype , yielding distances with errors less than 10% .",
    "they surmised that these objects could belong to the outer arm , but stopped short of claiming detection of a spiral arm , as such . within the same galactic longitude range as considered here",
    ", they had very few stars at their disposal .",
    "here we have filled in this gap  but still we do not claim that either fig .  [ arms_distances_phot ] or the preferred blue curve in fig .  [",
    "histogram_distances : b ] , accounting for the range of luminosity classes present in the sample , rules in or out an outer arm at 56  kpc .",
    "cbe stars are massive , intrinsically - luminous stars capable of being seen to very large distances . among the current sample ,",
    "there are several examples of cbe stars at distances large enough to indicate they lie beyond even the putative outer arm .",
    "the reddening of such objects ought to closely match the integrated galactic value since little galactic dust should lie beyond them in the far outer disc .",
    "less distant cbe stars should in general exhibit reddenings below the total for the relevant sightline .",
    "the most widely used source of integrated reddenings is the work of .",
    "we have plotted the measured colour - excess , @xmath90 , for each cbe star against the colour excess , @xmath91 , provided by sfd98 ( fig .",
    "[ asymptotic_reddenings ] : both values are listed in table  [ reddenings_t ] ) .",
    "the former is a spot value pertaining to a single line of sight , while the latter applies to a spatial resolution element about 6 arcmins across .",
    "hence it should be kept in mind that small variations in the ism will add a random noise element to the comparisons we make .",
    "we continue to exclude the four stars that do not have a measured @xmath92 in table  [ reddenings_t ] .",
    "a general property of the diagram is that for all but two objects , @xmath93 , to within the errors .",
    "this accords with expectation .",
    "the stars shown in red are the most distant , at more than 8  kpc away , whose reddenings should most nearly match the total galactic value ( these are specifically , objects #  11 , 26 , 35 , 39 , 40 , 50 , 54 , 55 , and 60 ) . all but one of these stars ( #  40 ) are early - b dwarfs .",
    "however , apart from #  40 , we find that the measured colour excesses for these objects are distinctly less than those from the reddening map .",
    "the discrepancy is of order 0.2 - 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "this undershoot is broadly in keeping with the result of @xcite that sfd98 typically overestimate the reddening by a factor of 1.16 . to illustrate this ,",
    "a second reference line is drawn in figure  [ asymptotic_reddenings ] with this correction applied .    for object #  40",
    "the situation is quite different , since the datum from indicates a very much lower total dust column than we obtain .",
    "we notice in the sfd98 temperature map ( that is much less well - resolved spatially than the emissivity map ) a large hot spot roughly corresponding to the upper part of the galactic chimney linked to w4 ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : it seems plausible therefore that the cause of the problem is the adoption of too high a dust temperature for this particular sightline predicting too low a dust column .",
    "a similar but not so extreme discrepancy arises in the case of object #  42 .",
    "a further group of stars can be picked out in fig .",
    "[ asymptotic_reddenings ] , whose colour excesses fall above the lower reference line but remain compatible with or below the sfd98 equality line . they are objects #  17 , 19 , 22 , 32 , 41 , 44 , 49 , 51 , 52 , 61 , 64 . as their estimated distances either exceed @xmath69  kpc , or their sightlines are at latitudes higher than @xmath94 it is conceivable these objects also lie beyond most / all of the dust column",
    ". alternatively if the scaling down of the sfd98 reddening by a factor of 1.16 is consistently the better guide to the total galactic value , it might be concluded our reddenings for these stars are too high , perhaps through under - correction for the circumstellar disc contribution , and their estimated distances too low .",
    "a clear feature of the sample as a whole is that their measured reddenings are a significant fraction of the sightline total , ranging from about half the sfd98 value up to rough equality with it .",
    "these large fractions of the total dust columns are to be expected given the long sightlines to these intrinsically bright objects .",
    "in this study , we investigated a 100  deg@xmath95 portion of the galactic plane , between @xmath0 and @xmath67 , that includes a part of the perseus arm , @xmath72  kpc away and of the less well - established outer or cygnus arm , 56  kpc distant .",
    "we studied a group of 67 candidate classical be stars that we selected among 230 that in turn were selected from follow - up of candidate emission line stars .",
    "we determined their spectral types with an estimated accuracy of @xmath6 sub - type and measured colour excesses via sed fitting in the blue ( 3800    5000   ) , and made appropriate correction for the contribution to the colour excess for circumstellar emission .",
    "distances were determined via spectroscopic parallaxes , after luminosity classes had been assessed using ms fits to a / f stars of similar reddening selected via colour - cuts from iphas photometry , in the vicinity of each cbe star .",
    "our main findings are :    * iphas offers very effective , easy selection of moderately reddened ( @xmath96 ) classical be candidates : their identity has been confirmed by a combination of low resolution optical spectroscopy and infrared photometry . * our magnitude limited sample ( @xmath97 ) includes 1015 stars in the outer disc at galactocentric radii where the stellar density gradient is likely to be steepening ( @xmath98  kpc , or heliocentric distances greater than 7  kpc ) .",
    "these objects exhibit reddenings comparable with those obtained from the map of @xcite , serving to emphasise how far out in the galactic disc they are . *",
    "the errors on the distance estimates remain too large to obtain a decisive statistical test of models for the spatial distribution of the cbe stars .",
    "the major , presently irreducible , contribution to the error budget is the spread of absolute magnitude associated with a given spectral type .",
    "these first results will be investigated in more depth , using a much larger sample of @xmath99 classical be star candidates observed with fast , aided by extinction - distance curves built from iphas photometry ( using a new bayesian implementation of mead , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this approach has the potential to provide a better grip on both luminosity class and distance even in the absence of precise absorption - line diagnostics .",
    "the longer term prospect is that astrometry returned by the gaia mission , due to launch in 2013 , will greatly improve the distances estimated for samples of objects like the one presented in this study . from predicted end - of - mission performance data @xcite",
    ", it appears we can look forward to @xmath100% parallax errors for our objects perhaps within the decade , as compared with up to 20% presently .",
    "especially when accompanied by carefully measured extinctions , that are essential for clarifying intrinsic absolute magnitudes , further enlargement of the sample of well - characterised fainter cbe stars will provide an avenue to better test our knowledge both of galactic structure and of massive - star evolution .",
    "this paper makes use of data obtained as part of iphas carried out at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "the int is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "all iphas data are processed by the cambridge astronomical survey unit , at the institute of astronomy in cambridge .",
    "we also acknowledge the use of data obtained at the int and the nordic optical telescope as part of a cci international time programme . the low - resolution spectra were obtained at the flwo-1.5 m with fast , which is operated by harvard - smithsonian centre for astrophysics .",
