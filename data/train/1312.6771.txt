    "recently , the theoretical prediction and experimental discovery of the topological insulator with the time - reversal symmetry , the @xmath0 topological insulator , has attracted a lot of attention in condensed matter physics.@xcite the topological phase is beyond the landau phase concept and characterized by nontrivial topological invariants that lead the spin hall conductance to be nonzero quantized .",
    "the topological insulators are gapped in the bulk but have gapless edge state protected by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the concept of the topological insulator has also been expanded into the lattice symmetry protected topological phases which exhibit topological invariants as long as the symmetries are not broken.@xcite    before the discovery of the @xmath0 topological insulator , the quantum hall states were the well - known realization of the topological phases .",
    "they exhibit the quantized hall conductance . however , the quantum hall states do not have the time - reversal symmetry as well as the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "in addition , the quantum hall states require an external magnetic field that forms the landau levels .",
    "haldane theoretically proposed a lattice model that also exhibits an integer hall conductance , but in the absence of external magnetic fields and the landau levels.@xcite it turns out that the integer hall conductance is just the chern topological invariant.@xcite such topological states are usually called the chern insulator . in the chern insulator , the time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "there were several proposals to realize the chern topological phase following the haldane idea .",
    "they include the proposals of the realization of the haldane model by loading ultracold atoms into optical lattices.@xcite recently , the chern insulator was discovered in thin films of cr - doped ( bi , sb)@xmath1te@xmath2,@xcite following the theoretical prediction.@xcite in the thin films , the ferromagnetic order breaks the time - reversal symmetry , and this effect is essentially described by electron correlations .    the theory of both the @xmath0 and chern topological insulators is based on the energy band theory , where electron correlations are weak . the effect of electron correlations on the topological phases has also attracted much attention.@xcite one may expect that weak electron correlations do not change the topological properties of the topological insulators . however , strong electron correlations can give rise to qualitative changes of their properties .",
    "most studies have focused on the correlation effects in the @xmath0 topological insulators .",
    "the electron correlations can drive the topological insulating phase to the mott or slater insulating phases .",
    "the slater transition is accompanied by a long - range order , whereas in the mott transition spontaneous symmetry breaking is absent.@xcite in particular , when the local coulomb interaction is included in the kane - mele model of the @xmath0 topological insulator,@xcite it drives the band topological insulating state into a spin - density - wave state , where the time - reversal symmetry is broken.@xcite depending on the model parameters , the phase transition may go through a spin - liquid phase.@xcite however , there are still debates over the existence of the spin - liquid state.@xcite    in contrast to the @xmath0 topological insulators , the effects of electron correlations on the chern insulators have received less attention . originally , the haldane model , which describes a chern insulator , was a spinless fermion model .",
    "most studies have introduced nonlocal nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions into the haldane model and investigated their effects on the topological properties.@xcite the nearest - neighbor interactions drive the system into a charge - ordered insulating phase .",
    "the charge - ordered phase is topologically trivial , and the phase transition is of first order.@xcite while the time - reversal symmetry is broken in both the chern - insulating and the charge - ordered phases , the inversion symmetry , which is preserved in the chern - insulating phase , is lost in the charge - ordered phase .",
    "this situation is similar to the slater transition in the @xmath0 topological insulators , where the transition is accompanied by symmetry breaking .",
    "however , it is still not clear what happens to the mott transition , which is not accompanied by any symmetry breaking , in the topological insulators .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effects of electron correlations in a chern insulator that is described by the haldane model .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies,@xcite we incorporate a local interaction into the haldane model . the local interaction is the short - range coulomb interaction between the itinerant electrons and additional localized spinless fermions .",
    "this interaction is essentially the type of the local interaction in the falicov - kimball model.@xcite the haldane model with the falicov - kimball interaction can also be considered as an asymmetric version of the kane - mele - hubbard model , where electrons with a fixed spin component are frozen .",
    "the time reversal symmetry is preserved in the kane - mele - hubbard model , but it is broken in the haldane - falicov - kimball model .",
    "it is well known that the falicov - kimball model describes well the correlation - induced phase transitions with and without inversion - symmetry breaking.@xcite one may expect that with the local coulomb interaction the introduced model is suitable for studying the topological phase transitions due to electron correlations with and without inversion - symmetry breaking in chern insulators .",
    "we employ the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) to study the phase transition .",
    "the dmft was widely and successfully used to study electron correlations.@xcite in particular , the falicov - kimball model was intensively studied within the dmft.@xcite we find that when the inversion symmetry is preserved , electron correlations drive the system from the topological chern insulator to a pseudogap metallic state , and then to the topologically trivial mott insulator . the metallic state is non - fermi - liquid with the renormalized mass and velocity of weyl fermions .",
    "it always exists between the chern and the mott insulators .",
    "when the inversion symmetry is broken , electron correlations form a charge - ordering gap , and at the same time they drive the system from the topological charge - ordered state to the topologically trivial charge - ordered state .",
    "both the topological invariant and the long - range charge order coexist in the topological charge - ordered state .",

    "<S> the phase transition driven by electron correlations in a chern insulator is investigated within the dynamical mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the chern insulator is described by the haldane model and the electron correlations are incorporated by introducing the short - range interaction between the itinerant electrons and localized fermions . in the preservation of the inversion symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the electron correlations drive the system from the chern insulator to a renormalized pseudogap metal , and then to the topologically trivial mott insulator . when the inversion symmetry is broken , a charge ordering and a nontrivial chern topological invariant coexist . </S>"
