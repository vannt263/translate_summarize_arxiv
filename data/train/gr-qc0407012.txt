    "after an early history marked by vigorous debate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the existence of gravitational radiation has become accepted as a hallmark prediction of einstein s general theory of relativity . despite indirect evidence supporting this prediction , however , gravitational waves have yet to be observed directly . indeed , rough ,",
    "order - of - magnitude calculations indicate a typical passing wave will produce only tiny material strains of order @xmath0 . a new generation of laser - interferometric gravitational wave observatories",
    "have recently been commissioned , and several are already operational , which aim to observe such strains @xcite and thereby detect gravitational waves incident on earth .",
    "these experiments are necessarily extremely delicate and , as a result , both initial detection and the long - term goal of extracting new information about the distant sources of a particular gravitational wave must be aided by detailed theoretical predictions .",
    "a community of theorists have turned to numerical simulations of the full , non - linear einstein equations to identify the characteristic features of the gravitational radiation generated by various sources .",
    "an impressive array of techniques have developed within this young field of numerical relativity which aim to provide the ongoing experimental effort with accurate predictions . however , the program faces a number of challenges , from foundational questions to issues of implementation and interpretation of results . here",
    ", we consider one issue of interpretation .",
    "we ask how , exactly , the well - known theoretical description of gravitational radiation outside quiescent black holes due to teukolsky @xcite might be applied to the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the notion of gravitational radiation in general relativity does not have universal meaning .",
    "rather , a proper definition can be given only in regions of space - time , _ radiation zones _",
    ", whose geometry is characterized by two distinct length scales @xcite : one describing an `` average '' radius of curvature and a second , much shorter scale corresponding to the wavelength of gravitational waves .",
    "because these two scales can be distinguished only when the waves contribute small corrections to the `` average '' curvature , many analyses of gravitational radiation are founded on perturbation theory .",
    "examples include not only the standard analysis in linearized gravity , but the regge ",
    "wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite approaches , as well as teukolsky s .",
    "even the asymptotic formulation of the gravitational radiation @xcite , which applies to quite general space - times , operates by studying differences between the physical metric and a fixed asymptotic metric near conformal infinity . in numerical relativity , however , all of these analyses are difficult to implement .",
    "the perturbation approaches are complicated because no background metric on space - time is known _ a priori _ , while the asymptotic approach needs access to field values far outside the computational domain .",
    "this paper focusses on teukolsky s perturbative approach since it describes radiation fields near a rotating black hole , the expected end - state of many physical processes producing relatively strong gravitational wave signals .",
    "we first identify the essential elements of the teukolsky formalism which derive from its fixed background geometry .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the preferred tetrad of basis vectors on space - time which underlies the definition of teukolsky s fields .",
    "although this tetrad arises as a perturbation of a canonical , kinnersley tetrad @xcite for the background kerr geometry , we show one can approximate it using only the _ physical _ metric , eliminating any reference to the background . the construction of this approximate kinnersley tetrad occurs naturally in two stages .",
    "the first , which is completed in this paper , fixes the directions of the desired tetrad vectors .",
    "because the final results of our analysis make no mention of a background geometry , they may be applied unambiguously to a broad class of space - times .",
    "we give concrete criteria characterizing this class , and find it includes many examples which differ _ non - perturbatively _ from the kerr geometry . in particular , when a numerical simulation produces a single black hole settling down to equilibrium , this first stage should be viable even at relatively early times after the hole forms .",
    "the problem of the second stage , fixing the scalings of the tetrad vectors along these preferred directions , is described in some detail here but not solved .",
    "we plan to present a solution in a future paper .",
    "however , even the first stage alone provides significant gauge - invariant information partially characterizing the gravitational field encoded in the numerical variables .",
    "an earlier letter @xcite presented one scheme to extract such information , and this paper can be regarded as an elaboration and expansion of that presentation .    like the teukolsky formalism itself , several of this paper s results",
    "are most simply expressed in the newman ",
    "penrose approach @xcite to space - time geometry .",
    "however , because many existing numerical codes do not currently implement this approach , we strive to present our final results in a form which does not refer explicitly to newman ",
    "penrose quantities .",
    "rather , we seek a form which would allow the teukolsky fields to be deduced _",
    "ab initio _ from the physical metric .",
    "there is a price to be paid for this , as certain results appear more complicated in this language .",
    "a complementary , and slightly more comprehensive , analysis based on the newman ",
    "penrose approach is given in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "this complementary analysis operates by picking an arbitrary tetrad on a generic space - time and showing how to transform it to yield one of interest in the teukolsky formalism .",
    "we present the two analyses separately to maximize the clarity of each .",
    "the following is an outline of this paper .",
    "first , we review elements of the teukolsky formalism from the traditional point of view , where a preferred background kerr geometry is known _ a priori _ , and formulate in detail the problem to be solved .",
    "second , we introduce the notion of a _",
    "transverse frame_. several such frames exist in a general space - time , all are calculable from the physical geometry , and one is the _ quasi - kinnersley frame _ of interest in the teukolsky formalism . finally , to help deploy these results for numerical relativity , we express these results using only initial - value data on an arbitrary spatial slice .",
    "we conclude with several comments .",
    "finally , an appendix elaborates one of the central calculations of the paper .",
    "the observable signature of a non - trivial gravitational field in general relativity is space - time curvature . however , because no coordinate system is preferred over any other , the coordinate components of the curvature tensor do not generally have any invariant physical meaning . one must be careful to distinguish , for example , between actual gravitational radiation and oscillations in those components caused by a peculiar choice of coordinates .",
    "the teukolsky formalism of first - order perturbation theory @xcite solves this problem using a family of gauge - invariant scalar variables originally proposed by newman and penrose @xcite .",
    "the newman ",
    "penrose approach introduces an initially arbitrary _ null tetrad _ @xmath1 on space - time .",
    "the four vector fields here are all null , with the first pair real and the second both complex and conjugate to one another .",
    "their only non - vanishing inner products are @xmath2 it is convenient to restrict attention to _ oriented _ null tetrads satisfying @xmath3 } = \\epsilon_{abcd},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the usual space - time volume element .",
    "this restriction can always be made without loss of generality in cases of physical interest .",
    "the independent components of the weyl curvature tensor in such a non - coordinate basis are encoded in five complex _ weyl scalars _ @xmath5      \\psi_2 & { } : = c_{abcd } \\ , \\ell^a    \\ , m^b \\ , \\bar m^c \\ , n^d \\\\[.5ex ]      \\psi_4 & { } : = c_{abcd } \\ , \\bar m^a \\ , n^b \\ , \\bar m^c \\ ,",
    "n^d .     \\end{array}\\quad",
    "\\begin{array}{@{}r@{}l@ { } }      \\psi_1 & { } : = c_{abcd } \\ , \\ell^a    \\ , m^b \\ , \\ell^c    \\ , n^d \\\\[.5ex ]      \\psi_3 & { } : = c_{abcd } \\ , \\ell^a    \\ , n^b \\ , \\bar m^c \\ , n^d     \\end{array}\\ ] ] these scalar quantities are naturally independent of any space - time coordinate system , but do clearly depend on the choice of null tetrad .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath6 can acquire direct ( observer - independent ) physical meaning only when a physically preferred null tetrad can be found .",
    "the teukolsky formalism picks a particular null tetrad for the newman ",
    "penrose scalars by exploiting special features of its given kerr background .",
    "specifically , any kerr geometry admits exactly two repeated principal null directions emphasize that only the directions of these vectors are determined . ]",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 . in any null tetrad @xmath1 whose real null vectors lie in these directions , all the newman ",
    "penrose curvature components except @xmath9 vanish , guaranteeing , as we discuss further below , the gauge - invariance of first - order perturbations in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to choose the directions of the tetrad fields in this way , but one must proceed to fix their scalings along these directions as well . a technique to do this in an exact kerr , or generally in any petrov type d ,",
    "geometry was first proposed by kinnersley @xcite . to explain this technique , it is useful to recall the generic ambiguity in the null tetrad .    at a given point of a general space - time",
    ", one can transform any given oriented null tetrad @xmath1 to any other using elementary transformations of three basic types .",
    "these include two families of elementary _ null rotations _ @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 arbitrary complex parameters , which preserve either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively , while changing the directions of all three of the other tetrad elements . a third family of _ spin - boost _ transformations @xmath18 , with @xmath19 an arbitrary complex parameter , mutually scales the real null vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , leaving their directions unchanged , and rotates the complex elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 by complementary phases .",
    "in addition to these , we highlight a single fourth transformation , the _ exchange _ operation @xmath22 , which interchanges the real and complex tetrad elements in pairs .",
    "the detailed formulae describing these transformations are unimportant here .",
    "they are standard and can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "we do , however , note the effects of these transformations on the weyl scalars @xmath6 : @xmath23          n(b ) : \\psi_n \\mapsto \\check\\psi_n & { } =               \\sum_{m = n}^4\\ , { { 4-n } \\choose { m - n}}\\ , b^{m - n}\\ , \\psi_m \\\\[1ex ]          s(c ) : \\psi_n \\mapsto \\tilde\\psi_n & { } = c^{2 - n } \\ , \\psi_n \\\\[1ex ]          e : \\psi_n \\mapsto { \\vbox{\\mathsurround=0pt       \\ialign{##\\crcr$\\hss\\rlap{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\rightharpoonup$}\\relax          \\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\leftharpoonup$}\\hss$\\crcr      \\noalign{\\nointerlineskip}$\\displaystyle{\\psi}$\\crcr}}\\relax      \\vphantom{\\psi}}_n & { } = \\psi_{4-n }      \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denote the usual binomial coefficients .    in the kerr geometry ,",
    "fixing @xmath16 and @xmath17 to lie in the two repeated principal null directions eliminates the null rotations completely , but does not restrict the spin - boost and exchange freedom in any way . to proceed ,",
    "kinnersley implicitly breaks the exchange symmetry by choosing @xmath16 to point outward , toward infinity , in the exterior of the hole and then sets @xmath25 the quantity @xmath26 is one of the standard ricci rotation coefficients used in the newman ",
    "penrose approach . setting it to zero",
    "does not eliminate the residual spin - boost ambiguity entirely , however , as one remains free to do spin - boost transformations with parameters @xmath19 satisfying @xmath27 note that , since the right side vanishes , this equation is independent of the scaling of the vector field @xmath16 , and implies only that @xmath19 must be constant along each of its integral curves .",
    "the set of such curves rule the exterior region of the black hole and each intersects a unique point of future null infinity . as a result , adapting the scaling of the tetrad near infinity to stationary observers there uniquely determines the kinnersley tetrad everywhere on kerr space - time . that is , fixing the scalings of @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that their spatial projections relative to a stationary observer have equal magnitude near infinity breaks the remaining spin - boost invariance .    in the teukolsky formalism ,",
    "one considers only space - times describing perturbations of a _ known _ kerr metric .",
    "the physical metric , consisting of both background and perturbation , generally does not have repeated principal null directions , and does not admit a preferred kinnserley tetrad .",
    "however , it is nonetheless natural to restrict attention to null tetrads of this metric which differ from the background s kinnersley tetrad only at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "this is teukolsky s approach . in such",
    "a _ perturbed kinnersley tetrad _ ,",
    "all of the curvature components except @xmath9 vanish at leading order , though all may acquire first - order corrections . as a result ,",
    "all components except @xmath9 are invariant under first - order diffeomorphisms , the gauge transformations of the linearized theory .",
    "moreover , the residual , first - order ambiguity in the tetrad is generated by null rotations with parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 which vanish at leading order , and spin - boosts with parameters @xmath19 equal to unity at leading order .",
    "the exchange operation , being finite , is disallowed .",
    "these residual transformations certainly modify the perturbed tetrad , but do not affect the values of the curvature components @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 and @xmath11 evaluated in _ any _ such perturbed tetrad are invariant in both senses , and acquire physical meanings .",
    "specifically , using an analysis of the geodesic deviation equation due to szekeres @xcite , they are associated with transverse gravitational radiation propagating along the null directions @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the components @xmath28 and @xmath29 in a perturbed kinnersley tetrad are invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms , but may be given any value whatsoever by performing suitable first - order null rotations on the tetrad .",
    "they are therefore pure gauge in the teukolsky formalism . in a variety of situations , including both",
    "the reconstruction of metric perturbations in the first - order theory @xcite and a second - order perturbation analysis @xcite , it is convenient to use the remaining null rotation freedom to set @xmath30 this can always be done , and exhausts the first - order null rotation freedom in the tetrad .",
    "there is no similar convenient criterion to eliminate the first - order spin - boosts , but none is needed in the teukolsky formalism .",
    "let us now focus on the subtleties inherent in applying teukolsky s techniques in numerical relativity .",
    "black holes in general relativity are known to be stable @xcite .",
    "thus , when a numerical evolution produces a space - time containing a single black hole , one should expect it to settle down over time , approaching a quiescent final state .",
    "a description via perturbation theory should accordingly become increasingly viable over time , although in practice it may be far from clear exactly _ how _ a given physical metric should be so described .",
    "one natural response to this difficulty would be to search among _ all _ possible kerr metrics on the given space - time for one in which the perturbation , the difference between the physical metric and that particular kerr metric , is smallest . however , even if it were clear how to conduct such a search systematically , it would likely be an extremely difficult procedure .",
    "we take a different approach here .",
    "the key element of the teukolsky formalism provided by the background kerr metric is its kinnersley tetrad . rather than search for an approximate kerr metric on space - time whose kinnersley tetrad will allow us to exploit the teukolsky formalism",
    ", we search directly for an approximation to that kinnersley tetrad .    given",
    "_ only _ the physical metric on a perturbed kerr space - time , a natural way to begin searching for its perturbed kinnersley tetrad is to seek tetrads for the physical metric satisfying eq .",
    "( [ kinn ] ) .",
    "that is , to find a tetrad with @xmath28 and @xmath29 vanishing at leading order , simply demand they vanish to all orders .",
    "this eliminates only gauge degrees of freedom in first - order perturbation theory , and there is no obvious problem of principle seeking such tetrads at an arbitrary point of a general space - time . the components @xmath10 and @xmath11 in such a frame can not generally be set to zero simultaneously by further refining the choice of tetrad . even in perturbation theory , these components are physical and provide a rough , quantitative measure of how `` far '' such a space - time is from kerr @xcite .",
    "motivated by their association with transverse radiation in perturbation theory , we refer to tetrads satisfying eq .",
    "( [ kinn ] ) as _ transverse null tetrads_. we emphasize , however , that in regions of space - time supporting strongly self - gravitating fields , there may be no precise relation between these tetrads and any proper notion of gravitational radiation .    even in the comparatively simple case of a perturbed kerr space - time , there may be many different transverse tetrads .",
    "these may differ from one another in two ways .",
    "first , the transversality condition of eq .",
    "( [ kinn ] ) is invariant under the spin - boost and exchange transformations of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) whence , whenever one transverse tetrad exists , so do infinitely many others .",
    "in addition to this generic multiplicity , however , there could exist distinct transverse tetrads on a given space - time related by non - trivial null rotations .",
    "this second ambiguity raises a more serious problem in our context since even the _ directions _ of the real null vectors in a transverse tetrad on a perturbed kerr space - time may have nothing to do with the underlying kinnersley tetrad .",
    "the current paper addresses this second difficulty .",
    "it constructs , _ up to spin - boost and exchange _ , a unique tetrad on a broad class of space - times comprising a _ non - perturbative _ neighborhood of the kerr geometry in the space of solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "we refer to the product of this construction as the _ quasi - kinnersley frame_. mathematically , it is an equivalence class @xmath31 of null tetrads which can be transformed into one another using only spin - boost and exchange transformations .",
    "the set of all tetrads at a point is a disjoint union of such equivalence classes , and we refer to these generally as _",
    "null frames_. although this nomenclature may be slightly unfortunate  the terms `` null tetrad '' and `` null frame '' are often used interchangeably in the literature  we will adhere strictly to it here since the notion of a frame is essential to our argument .",
    "a null frame is completely determined by the common _ directions _ , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , of the real null vectors in its constituent tetrads .",
    "these real null vectors span a time - like 2-plane in the tangent space at each point of space - time , while the complex vectors span the orthogonal space - like 2-plane .",
    "spin - boost and exchange operations may change the bases defined by the tetrad on these two sub - spaces , but not the sub - spaces themselves . since knowledge of either orthogonal sub - space determines the other ,",
    "the real null directions suffice to determine the frame .",
    "mathematically , we can exploit this interrelation by associating a 2-form}$ ] . ] @xmath32 } - m_{[a}\\ , \\bar m_{b]}.\\ ] ] to any given null tetrad @xmath1 .",
    "this complex 2-form is invariant under spin - boosts and only changes sign under exchange .",
    "in addition , it is self - dual and unit : @xmath33 in fact , _ all _ unit self - dual 2-forms arise in this way . for each",
    ", one can find an oriented null tetrad of vectors @xmath1 such that @xmath34 takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ sig ] ) . for a given @xmath34 , we have @xmath35          \\sigma_{ab}\\ , m^b & = -{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ , m_a & \\qquad          \\sigma_{ab}\\ , \\bar m^b & = { { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ , \\bar m_a .      \\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "that is , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the unique _ real _ null eigenvectors of @xmath34 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are its unique complex null eigenvectors orthogonal to both @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "every unit , self - dual 2-form has such eigenvectors , each of which is determined only up to scaling , whence the tetrad is not unique .",
    "rather , there is a canonical one - to - one correspondence between null frames and non - null directions in the complex , three - dimensional space of self - dual 2-forms at each point of space - time .    a non - null",
    ", self - dual 2-form @xmath34 is associated to a _ transverse _",
    "null frame if and only if @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the weyl curvature tensor of space - time .",
    "for most @xmath34 , the right side would include additional terms of the form @xmath38}$ ] and @xmath39}$ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to show that whenever @xmath40 is self - dual on the left side of eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) , the right side is self - dual as well .",
    "thus , the search for transverse frames reduces to an eigenvalue equation for the weyl tensor , viewed as a map from the space of self - dual 2-forms to itself .",
    "notably , the eigenvalue for a given eigen - form of the weyl tensor is directly connected to the newman ",
    "penrose scalars in the associated null frame : @xmath41 denotes the @xmath9 scalar , which is invariant under both spin - boost and exchange , evaluated in a _ transverse _ frame .",
    "the above result establishes a one - to - one correspondence between transverse frames @xmath31 and non - null , self - dual eigen - forms @xmath34 of the weyl tensor .",
    "the number and nature of the these eigen - forms are very well understood @xcite , and depend solely on the algebraic ( petrov ) class of space - time .",
    "in particular , there are exactly three transverse frames at each point of a algebraically general ( type i ) space - time .",
    "meanwhile , the weyl tensors of type d space - times , such as the kerr solution , have one degenerate eigen - space , leading to infinitely many transverse frames , as well as a distinguished non - degenerate eigen - form associated with the kinnersley frame .",
    "type ii geometries admit only one transverse frame . in each of these three cases , therefore , the possible ambiguity in the transverse frame of interest is _",
    "finite_. one can recognize the kinnersley frame of a type d or type ii geometry immediately , and the only ambiguity occurs in the general case , where there are only three possible choices .",
    "the most specialized algebraic classes , types n and iii ( as well as type 0 , where the weyl tensor vanishes ) , are very rare and correspond to highly specialized fields which are unlikely to arise in numerical relativity unless sought specifically .",
    "we do not consider them further here .",
    "the central open issue is this . at a typical point in the exterior of a black hole formed in a numerical simulation",
    ", the weyl tensor will most likely be of type i. at late times , perturbation theory is expected to become sufficiently accurate to be meaningfully applied and the perturbed kinnersley tetrad , when fixed to first order according to eq .",
    "( [ kinn ] ) , will then belong to a transverse frame of the physical metric . in order to implement the teukolsky formalism in this situation",
    ", one must discover to which of the three transverse frames of the physical geometry this tetrad belongs .",
    "there are a number of ways one might do this in practice @xcite , but all are based on the same basic idea . if it is possible to distinguish the eigen-_value _ of the weyl tensor associated with the quasi - kinnersley frame , then its eigen-_form _ can be singled out using eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "the frame may then be reconstructed from the form using eq .",
    "( [ recon ] ) .",

    "to realize this point explicitly , we calculate the characteristic polynomial @xmath42 of the linear map defined by the weyl tensor from the space of self - dual 2-forms to itself . this calculation is described in some detail in an appendix .",

    "the quasi - kinnersley frame is _ unique _ in that it varies analytically when perturbed , and is therefore arguably a singularly useful structure in the sort of analyses contemplated here .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a second step must be taken to complete the construction begun in this paper and allow an application of the full range of teukolsky s techniques to the results of numerical simulations .",
    "this step will break the spin - boost - invariance of the current results and choose a preferred _ quasi - kinnersley tetrad _ within the quasi - kinnersley frame . unlike the frame - fixing procedure described above , which has been entirely local , done separately at each space - time point , fixing the scalings seems likely to require a _",

    "tetrad_. however , as in kinnersley s case , this will not determine the tetrad uniquely .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath125 condition ties together the scalings of tetrad elements along the integral curves of @xmath16 , it would seem that fixing the scaling close to the black hole would involve making choices in the evolved fields at the outer boundary at _ much _ later times .",
    "since long - time evolutions of the full , non - linear equations of general relativity are currently unavailable , it seems likely an indirect approach to this problem will be required for the near - term .",
