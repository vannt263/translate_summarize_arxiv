    "most astrophysical systems , e.g. accretion disks , stellar winds , the interstellar medium ( ism ) and intercluster medium are turbulent with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of their properties .",
    "this turbulence which spans from km to many kpc ( see discussion in armstrong , rickett , & spangler 1995 ; scalo 1987 ; lazarian , pogosyan , & esquivel 2002 ) holds the key to many astrophysical processes . for instance , propagation of cosmic rays and their acceleration is strongly affected by mhd turbulence .",
    "recent research has shown that a substantial part of the earlier results in the field require revision .",
    "earlier research used ad hoc models of mhd turbulence and this entailed erroneous conclusions .",
    "before we start a discussion of mhd turbulence let us recall some basic properties of the hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "all turbulent systems have one thing in common : they have a large  reynolds number  \" ( @xmath0 ; l= the characteristic scale or driving scale of the system , v = the velocity difference over this scale , and @xmath1=viscosity ) , the ratio of the viscous drag time on the largest scales ( @xmath2 ) to the eddy turnover time of a parcel of gas ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a similar parameter , the  magnetic reynolds number  \" , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6=magnetic diffusion ) , is the ratio of the magnetic field decay time ( @xmath7 ) to the eddy turnover time ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the properties of the flows on all scales depend on @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "flows with @xmath9 are laminar ; chaotic structures develop gradually as @xmath8 increases , and those with @xmath10 are appreciably less chaotic than those with @xmath11 . observed features such as star forming clouds and accretion disks are very chaotic with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us start by considering incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence , which can be described by the kolmogorov theory ( kolmogorov 1941 ) .",
    "suppose that we excite fluid motions at a scale @xmath14 .",
    "we call this scale the _ energy injection scale _ or the _ largest energy containing eddy scale_. for instance , an obstacle in a flow excites motions on scales of the order of its size . then the energy injected at the scale @xmath14 cascades to progressively smaller and smaller scales at the eddy turnover rate , i.e. @xmath15 , with negligible energy losses along the cascade .. ] ultimately , the energy reaches the molecular dissipation scale @xmath16 , i.e. the scale where the local @xmath17 , and is dissipated there .",
    "the scales between @xmath14 and @xmath16 are called the _ inertial range _ and it typically covers many decades .",
    "the motions over the inertial range are _ self - similar _ and this provides tremendous advantages for theoretical description .",
    "the beauty of the kolmogorov theory is that it does provide a simple scaling for hydrodynamic motions .",
    "if the velocity at a scale @xmath18 from the inertial range is @xmath19 , the kolmogorov theory states that the kinetic energy ( @xmath20 as the density is constant ) is transferred to next scale within one eddy turnover time ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus within the kolmogorov theory the energy transfer rate ( @xmath22 ) is scale - independent , @xmath23 and we get the famous kolmogorov scaling @xmath24    the one - dimensional , which , for isotropic turbulence , is given by @xmath25 . ] energy spectrum @xmath26 is the amount of energy between the wavenumber @xmath27 and @xmath28 divided by @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath26 is a power law , @xmath30 is the energy _ near _ the wavenumber @xmath31 . since @xmath32 , kolmogorov",
    "scaling implies @xmath33    kolmogorov scalings were the first major advance in the theory of incompressible turbulence .",
    "they have led to numerous applications in different branches of science ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) .",
    "however , astrophysical fluids are magnetized and the a dynamically important magnetic field should interfere with eddy motions .    paradoxically , astrophysical measurements are consistent with kolmogorov spectra ( see lpe02 ) .",
    "for instance , interstellar scintillation observations indicate an electron density spectrum is very close to @xmath34 for @xmath35 - @xmath36 ( see armstrong et  al .",
    "1995 ) . at larger scales",
    "lpe02 summarizes the evidence of -@xmath37 velocity power spectrum over pc - scales in hi .",
    "solar - wind observations provide _ in - situ _ measurements of the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations and leamon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also obtained a slope of  @xmath38 -@xmath37 .",
    "is this a coincidence ?",
    "what properties is the magnetized compressible ism expected to have ?",
    "we will deal with these questions , and some related issues , below .    here",
    "we discuss a focused approach which aims at obtaining a clear understanding on the fundamental level , and considering physically relevant complications later .",
    "the creative synthesis of both approaches is the way , we think , that studies of astrophysical turbulence should proceed . certainly an understanding of mhd turbulence in the most ideal terms is a necessary precursor to understanding the complications posed by more realistic physics and numerical effects . for review of general properties of mhd ,",
    "see a recent book by biskamp ( 1993 ) .",
    "in what follows , we first consider observational data that motivate our study (  2 ) , then discuss theoretical approaches to incompressible mhd turbulence (  3 ) .",
    "we move to the effects of compressibility in  4 and discuss implications of our new understanding of mhd turbulence for cosmic ray dynamics in  5 .",
    "we present the summary in  6 .",
    "kolmogorov turbulence is the simplest possible model of turbulence .",
    "since it is incompressible and not magnetized , it is completely specified by its velocity spectrum . if a passive scalar field , like `` dye particles '' or temperature inhomogeneities , is subjected to kolmogorov turbulence , the resulting spectrum of the passive scalar density is also kolmogorov ( see lesieur 1990",
    "; warhaft 2000 ) . in compressible and magnetized turbulence",
    "this is no longer true , and a complete characterization of the turbulence requires not only a study of the velocity statistics but also the statistics of density and magnetic fluctuations .    direct studies of turbulence have been done mostly for interstellar medium and for the solar wind . while for the solar wind _ in - situ _ measurements are possible , studies of interstellar turbulence require inverse techniques to interpret the observational data .",
    "attempts to study interstellar turbulence with statistical tools date as far back as the 1950s ( von horner 1951 ; kamp de friet 1955 ; munch 1958 ; wilson et  al .",
    "1959 ) and various directions of research achieved various degree of success ( see reviews by kaplan & pickelner 1970 ; dickman 1985 ; armstrong et  al .",
    "1995 ; lazarian 1999a , 1999b ; lpe02 ) .",
    "solar wind ( see review goldstein & roberts 1995 ) studies allow pointwise statistics to be measured directly using spacecrafts .",
    "these studies are the closest counterpart of laboratory measurements .",
    "the solar wind flows nearly radially away from the sun , at up to about 700 km / s .",
    "this is much faster than both spacecraft motions and the alfvn speed .",
    "therefore , the turbulence is `` frozen '' and the fluctuations at frequency @xmath39 are directly related to fluctuations at the scale @xmath27 in the direction of the wind , as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the solar wind velocity ( horbury 1999 ) .",
    "usually two types of solar wind are distinguished , one being the fast wind which originates in coronal holes , and the slower bursty wind .",
    "both of them show , however , @xmath42 scaling on small scales .",
    "the turbulence is strongly anisotropic ( see klein et  al .",
    "1993 ) with the ratio of power in motions perpendicular to the magnetic field to those parallel to the magnetic field being around 30 .",
    "the intermittency of the solar wind turbulence is very similar to the intermittency observed in hydrodynamic flows ( horbury & balogh 1997 ) .",
    "studies of turbulence statistics of ionized media ( see spangler & gwinn 1990 ) have provided information on the statistics of plasma density at scales @xmath43-@xmath44  cm .",
    "this was based on a clear understanding of processes of scintillations and scattering achieved by theorists ( see narayan & goodman 1989 ; goodman & narayan 1985 ) . a peculiar feature of the measured spectrum ( see armstrong et  al .",
    "1995 ) is the absence of the slope change at the scale at which the viscosity by neutrals becomes important .",
    "scintillation measurements are the most reliable data in the `` big power law '' plot in armstrong et al .",
    "however there are intrinsic limitations to the scintillations technique due to the limited number of sampling directions , its relevance only to ionized gas at extremely small scales , and the impossibility of getting velocity ( the most important ! ) statistics directly . therefore with the data one faces the problem of distinguishing actual turbulence from static density structures .",
    "moreover , the scintillation data does not provide the index of turbulence directly , but only shows that the data are consistent with kolmogorov turbulence . whether the ( 3d ) index can be -4 instead of -11/3 is still a subject of intense debate ( higdon 1984 ; narayan & goodman 1989 ) . in physical terms the former corresponds to the superposition of random shocks rather than eddies .",
    "additional information on the electron density is contained in the faraday rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources ( see simonetti & cordes 1988 ; simonetti 1992 ) . however , there is so far no reliable way to disentangle contributions of the magnetic field and the density to the signal .",
    "we feel that those measurements may give us the magnetic field statistics when we know the statistics of electron density better .",
    "spectral line data cubes are unique sources of information on interstellar turbulence .",
    "doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on the turbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "moreover , the statistical samples are extremely rich and not limited to discrete directions .",
    "in addition , line emission allows us to study turbulence at large scales , comparable to the scales of star formation and energy injection .    however , the problem of separating velocity and density fluctuations within hi data cubes is far from trivial ( lazarian 1995 , 1999b ; lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; lpe02 ) .",
    "the analytical description of the emissivity statistics of channel maps ( velocity slices ) in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) ( see also lazarian 1999b ; lpe02 for reviews ) shows that the relative contribution of the density and velocity fluctuations depends on the thickness of the velocity slice .",
    "in particular , the power - law asymptote of the emissivity fluctuations changes when the dispersion of the velocity at the scale under study becomes of the order of the velocity slice thickness ( the integrated width of the channel map ) .",
    "these results are the foundation of the velocity - channel analysis ( vca ) technique which provides velocity and density statistics using spectral line data cubes .",
    "the vca has been successfully tested using data cubes obtained via compressible magnetohydrodynamic simulations and has been applied to galactic and small magellanic cloud atomic hydrogen ( hi ) data ( lazarian et  al .",
    "2001 ; lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ; deshpande , dwarakanath , & goss 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of absorption effects ( lazarian & pogosyan 2002 ) has increased the power of this technique . finally , the vca can be applied to different species ( co , h@xmath45 etc . ) which should further increase its utility in the future .    within the present discussion",
    "a number of results obtained with the vca are important .",
    "first of all , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) hi data exhibit a kolmogorov - type spectrum for velocity and hi density from the smallest resolvable scale of 40  pc to the scale of the smc itself , i.e. 4  kpc .",
    "similar conclusions can be inferred from the galactic data ( green 1993 ) for scales of dozens of parsecs , although the analysis has not been done systematically .",
    "deshpande et al . ( 2000 ) studied absorption of hi on small scales toward cas a and cygnus a. within the vca their results can be interpreted as implying that on scales less than 1  pc the hi velocity is suppressed by ambipolar drag and the spectrum of density fluctuations is shallow @xmath46 . such a spectrum ( deshpande 2000 )",
    "can account for the small scale structure of hi observed in absorption .",
    "magnetic field statistics are the most poorly constrained aspect of ism turbulence .",
    "the polarization of starlight and of the far - infrared radiation ( fir ) from aligned dust grains is affected by the ambient magnetic fields . assuming that dust grains are always aligned with their longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field ( see the review lazarian 2000 ) , one gets the 2d distribution of the magnetic field directions in the sky .",
    "note that the alignment is a highly non - linear process in terms of the magnetic field and therefore the magnetic field strength is not available .    the statistics of starlight polarization ( see fosalba et  al .",
    "2002 ) is rather rich for the galactic plane and it allows to establish the spectrum @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a two dimensional wave vector describing the fluctuations over sky patch .. for sufficiently small areas of the sky analyzed the multipole analysis results coincide with the fourier analysis . ] for uniformly sampled turbulence it follows from lazarian & shutenkov ( 1990 ) that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the critical angular size of fluctuations which is proportional to the ratio of the injection energy scale to the size of the turbulent system along the line of sight . for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath54 .",
    "however , the real observations do not uniformly sample turbulence .",
    "many more close stars are present compared to the distant ones . thus the intermediate slops are expected .",
    "indeed , cho & lazarian ( 2002b ) showed through direct simulations that the slope obtained in fosalba et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) is compatible with the underlying kolmogorov turbulence . at the moment",
    "fir polarimetry does not provide maps that are really suitable to study turbulence statistics .",
    "this should change soon when polarimetry becomes possible using the airborne sofia observatory",
    ". a better understanding of grain alignment ( see lazarian 2000 ) is required to interpret the molecular cloud magnetic data where some of the dust is known not to be aligned ( see lazarian , goodman , & myers 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "another way to get magnetic field statistics is to use synchrotron emission .",
    "both polarization and intensity data can be used .",
    "the angular correlation of polarization data ( baccigalupi et  al . 2001 ) shows the power - law spectrum @xmath55 and we believe that the interpretation of it is similar to that of starlight polarization .",
    "indeed , faraday depolarization limits the depth of the sampled region .",
    "the intensity fluctuations were studied in lazarian & shutenkov ( 1990 ) with rather poor initial data and the results were inconclusive .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2002b ) interpreted the fluctuations of synchrotron emissivity ( giardino et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) in terms of turbulence with kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "attempts to describe magnetic turbulence statistics were made by iroshnikov ( 1963 ) and kraichnan ( 1965 ) .",
    "their model of turbulence ( ik theory ) is isotropic in spite of the presence of the magnetic field .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that a uniform external magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) is present",
    ". in the incompressible limit , any magnetic perturbation propagates _ along _ the magnetic field line . since wave packets are moving along the magnetic field line , there are two possible directions for propagation .",
    "if all the wave packets are moving in one direction , then they are stable to nonlinear order ( parker 1979 ) . therefore , in order to initiate turbulence , there must be opposite - traveling wave packets and the energy cascade occurs only when they collide .",
    "the ik theory starts from this observation , one of the consequences of which is the modification of the energy cascade timescale : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is alfven velocity of the mean field . here",
    ", the ik theory assumes that opposite - traveling isotropic wave packets of similar size interact . from this and the scale - invariance of energy cascade rate",
    ", they obtained @xmath59    however , the presence of the uniform magnetic component has non - trivial dynamical effects on the turbulence fluctuations .",
    "one obvious effect is that it is easy to mix field lines in directions perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and much more difficult to bend them .",
    "the ik theory assumes isotropy of the energy cascade in fourier space , an assumption which has attracted severe criticism ( montgomery & turner 1981 ; shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery 1983 ; montgomery & matthaeus 1995 ; sridhar & goldreich 1994 ; matthaeus et  al .",
    "mathematically , anisotropy manifests itself in the resonant conditions for 3-wave interactions : @xmath60 where @xmath61 s are wavevectors and @xmath62 s are wave frequencies .",
    "the first condition is a statement of wave momentum conservation and the second is a statement of energy conservation .",
    "alfvn waves satisfy the dispersion relation : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the component of wavevector parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "since only opposite - traveling wave packets interact , @xmath65 and @xmath66 must have opposite signs . then from equations ( [ k123 ] ) and ( [ w123 ] ) ,",
    "either @xmath67 or @xmath68 must be equal to 0 and @xmath69 must be equal to the nonzero initial parallel wavenumber .",
    "that is , zero frequency modes are essential for energy transfer ( shebalin et  al .",
    "therefore , in the wavevector space , 3-wave interactions produce an energy cascade which is strictly perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "however , in real turbulence , equation ( [ w123 ] ) does not need to be satisfied exactly , but only to within an an error of order @xmath70 ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ) .",
    "this implies that the energy cascade is not strictly perpendicular to @xmath56 , although clearly very anisotropic .",
    "we assume throughout this discussion that the rms turbulent velocity at the energy injection scale is comparable to the alfvn speed of the mean field and consider only scales below the energy injection scale .",
    "this is called _ strong _ turbulence regime .",
    "note that , as a consequence , the regime of @xmath71 is not considered in this review . however , the regime of @xmath72 is still relevant to the strong turbulence regime because scales below the energy equipartition scale is expected to fall in the strong turbulence regime ( cho & vishniac 2000a ) .",
    "an ingenious model very similar in its beauty and simplicity to the kolmogorov model has been proposed by goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ; hereinafter gs95 ) for incompressible strong mhd turbulence .",
    "they pointed out that motions perpendicular to the magnetic field lines mix them on a hydrodynamic time scale , i.e. at a rate @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the wavevector component perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and @xmath75 .",
    "these mixing motions couple to the wave - like motions parallel to magnetic field giving a _ critical balance _",
    "condition @xmath76 where @xmath64 is the component of the wavevector parallel to the local magnetic field .",
    "when the typical @xmath64 on a scale @xmath74 falls below this limit , the magnetic field tension is too weak to affect the dynamics and the turbulence evolves hydrodynamically , in the direction of increasing isotropy in phase space .",
    "this quickly raises the value of @xmath64 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath64 is large , the magnetic field tension dominates , the error @xmath77 in the matching conditions is reduced , and the nonlinear cascade is largely in the @xmath74 direction , which restores the critical balance .",
    "if conservation of energy in the turbulent cascade applies locally in phase space then the energy cascade rate ( @xmath78 ) is constant : @xmath79 combining this with the critical balance condition we obtain an anisotropy that increases with decreasing scale @xmath80 and a kolmogorov - like spectrum for perpendicular motions @xmath81 which is not surprising since the magnetic field does not influence motions that do not bend it . at the same time , the scale - dependent anisotropy reflects the fact that it is more difficult for the weaker , smaller eddies to bend the magnetic field .",
    "gs95 shows the duality of motions in mhd turbulence .",
    "those perpendicular to the mean magnetic field are essentially eddies , while those parallel to magnetic field are waves . the critical balance condition couples these two types of motions .    numerical simulations ( cho & vishniac 2000b ; maron & goldreich 2001 ; cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002 ) show reasonable agreements with the gs95 model .",
    ".notations for compressible turbulence [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ cho_table1 ]    for the rest of the review , we consider mhd turbulence of a single conducting fluid .",
    "while the gs95 model describes incompressible mhd turbulence well , no universally accepted theory exists for compressible mhd turbulence despite various attempts ( e.g. , higdon 1984 ) . earlier numerical simulations of compressible mhd turbulence covered a broad range of astrophysical problems , such as the decay of turbulence ( e.g.  mac low 1998 ; stone , ostriker , & gammie 1998 ) or turbulent modeling of the ism ( see recent review vazquez - semadeni 2002 ; see also passot , pouquet , & woodward 1988 ; vazquez - semadeni , passot , & pouquet 1995 ; passot , vazquez - semadeni , & pouquet 1995 ; vazquez - semadeni , passot , & pouquet 1996 for earlier pioneering 2d simulations and ostriker , gammie , & stone 1999 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ; padoan et  al . 2001",
