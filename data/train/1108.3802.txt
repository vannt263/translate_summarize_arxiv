    "we continue with the notation of @xcite , and define an angular kronecker constant @xmath12 $ ] such that @xmath13 in this note , the terminology , notations and results of @xcite will be used .",
    "this note is a supplement to @xcite , giving some bounds for angular kronecker constants of three - element sets of integers :    * theorem [ upperlowerbound ] uses the full machinery of @xcite to produce both upper and lower bounds for 3-element sets of non - zero , relatively prime integers with distinct absolute values .",
    "* theorem [ upperlowerbound ] and two results of @xcite are used to prove that @xmath14 for all @xmath2 consisting of non - zero integers with distinct absolute values .",
    "see theorem [ t : fivesixteenths ] .",
    "examples suggest that one should be able to lower this upper bound to @xmath1 for @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite provides an easy upper bound ( better than @xmath15 ) for any finite set @xmath2 of integers that does not contain @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the size of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath19 , this gives @xmath20 @xmath1 and this trivial upper bound is sharp if and only if @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the bound is @xmath23 and @xcite shows that this is sharp when @xmath24 a consequence of our next theorem is that the angular kronecker constant is strictly less than @xmath23 for all other three element sets ( that exclude @xmath16 ) .",
    "[ upperlowerbound]suppose @xmath25 are distinct and @xmath26 .",
    "assume @xmath27 @xmath28 and that @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31generate the lattice @xmath32 for some @xmath33 .",
    "we have the following bounds on angular kronecker constants : @xmath34 and@xmath35 where @xmath36    temporarily fix @xmath37 and put @xmath38 . for an integer @xmath39 , put @xmath40 . with this notation , the angular kronecker",
    "constant is the least constant @xmath41 such that for each @xmath42 there are integers @xmath43 such that @xmath44    the requirements @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be satisfied if and only for each @xmath42 there are integers @xmath47 such that @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the intervals @xmath50 \\text { and } \\\\ j_{2}(s ,",

    "hence it is necessary that for each @xmath42 there be an integer @xmath53 with the right end of @xmath54 left end of @xmath55 and the right end of @xmath56 left end of @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that if we let @xmath58 then a necessary condition on @xmath41 is that for each @xmath42 there is an integer @xmath53 satisfying @xmath59 however , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 then this inequality can not hold for any integer @xmath53 .",
    "thus a necessary condition for @xmath41 ( a lower bound on the kronecker constant ) is that @xmath41 must satisfy@xmath62 and this gives the lower bound stated in the theorem .",
    "now put @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the lower bound and @xmath65 is to be determined . then @xmath66 ,",
    "so for any @xmath67 there will be an integer @xmath53 such that @xmath68 is non - empty .",
    "if , in addition , the length of the overlap of the two intervals is at least @xmath69 , then we can be sure that for any choice of @xmath70 , there will be an integer @xmath39 with @xmath71 .        now consider ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath64 ensures that for any @xmath42 there is an integer @xmath53 with @xmath76 thus @xmath77 and therefore we can satisfy the inequality ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath78 if we choose @xmath79 that is , @xmath80 the construction ensures that if we take @xmath81 , then both inequalities @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be simultaneously satisfied for each @xmath82 with a suitable choice of integers @xmath47 .      to apply this result to show that the kronecker constant is less than @xmath23 for any three element set not containing @xmath16 , other than the sets @xmath85 it is convenient to first record some preliminary calculations .",
    "the arguments are elementary and we will only give the main idea for each .",
    "these assumptions imply that there is an integer @xmath39 with @xmath108 .",
    "it follows that @xmath109 and @xmath110 hence @xmath111 divides @xmath112 .",
    "this is not possible if @xmath113 and can only occur with @xmath106 if @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 since @xmath116 .",
    "assume @xmath125 and that the lattice is generated by @xmath29 , @xmath126 where we choose @xmath127 . if @xmath128 we are in the rectangular lattice case developed in @xcite , for which the angular kronecker constant is at most @xmath129 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath154 for all three element sets other than @xmath155 . in @xcite",
    "this was proved for the rectangular lattice case and for sum sets .",
    "as well , we have run our computer algorithm on all three element sets of positive integers with @xmath156 and the greatest kronecker constant is @xmath1 , occuring only on the integer multiples of @xmath153 .          c.c .",
