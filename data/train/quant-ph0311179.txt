    "bohr s complementarity principle and the closely related concept of duality in interferometric devices are fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics .",

    "but this is often a too idealized assumption because the probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each path generally depend on the detector position .",
    "the path predictability is then @xmath11dependent , @xmath13 , and so is the fringe visibility , @xmath14 , via the generalized version of the complementarity relation ( [ pv0 ] ) : @xmath15 the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the physical situations for which the expressions for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath10 can be analytically computed . as far as we know , this includes interference patterns of various types of double  slit experiments , the oscillations due to particle mixing shown , among others , by the neutral  kaon system and the differential cross section for mott scattering of identical particles or nuclei .",
    "these three kinds of phenomena , pertaining to distinct branches of physics , and the meaning of the variable @xmath11 , linked respectively to a linear position , a time variable or a scattering angle , are remarkably different from each other . in spite of this , we can always obtain a unified description in terms of the same @xmath11dependent expressions : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are _ constants_. in deriving eqs .",

    "this index has been defined to estimate the effective number of fringes , i.e. , how many of them appear in a given set  up before the visibility decreases by the usual factor of @xmath32 .",
