    "for simple liquids , the stokes  einstein ( se ) relation between the shear viscosity @xmath1 and the translational diffusion constant @xmath2 is an important characteristic of their transport properties  @xcite .",
    "specifically , this relation implies @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the temperature .",
    "however , when liquids are supercooled below their melting temperatures , the se relation is remarkably violated ( se violation ) , particularly near the glass transition temperature  @xcite . despite extensive efforts , the origins of se violation in supercooled liquids remain elusive .",
    "generally , transport coefficients such as @xmath2 and @xmath1 are mostly coupled at high temperatures .",
    "the characteristic time scale is associated with the structural @xmath6-relaxation time @xmath7 . by contrast , at supercooled states , the se violation implies that @xmath2 and @xmath1 are determined by different time scales .",
    "in fact , structural relaxations in supercooled liquids become spatially heterogeneous , which is a different behavior than the homogeneous dynamics observed in normal liquids  @xcite .",
    "thus , the physical implication of se violation is relevant to the question regarding which time scales determine the transport coefficients in glass - forming liquids . indeed ,",
    "alternative types of se relations @xmath8 or @xmath9 have been controversially tested by assuming that @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 ( analogous to the gaussian approximation ) or @xmath1 ( analogous to the maxwell model ) , respectively  @xcite .    for liquid water , various anomalies in both its thermodynamics and dynamics",
    "have been observed upon supercooling  @xcite .",
    "the se violation is one important anomaly that has been widely reported for supercooled water  @xcite . in the previous studies on supercooled water ,",
    "either @xmath12 or @xmath13 was tested for se violation .",
    "however , the original se relation @xmath4 has not been widely studied because of the high computational costs for calculating @xmath1 , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , to determine the origin of the se violation , obtaining @xmath1 is important .",
    "hence , the central aims of the present study are to obtain @xmath1 and to identify the time scales associated with @xmath1 and @xmath2 to reveal the origin of the se violation in supercooled water .",
    "the outline of the present study is as follows .",
    "first , the se violation in supercooled liquid water is examined using molecular dynamics simulations of the tip4p/2005 model  @xcite . in particular , comprehensive numerical calculations with respect to shear viscosity",
    "are performed on the basis of the shear stress correlation function , which are comparable with recent studies for supercooled water using spc / e  @xcite and tip4p/2005f  @xcite .",
    "our results provide a more systematic examination of the se violation in supercooled water .",
    "the justification of the scenario @xmath14 is demonstrated , which is consistent with the previous studies in simple liquids  @xcite .",
    "second , the role of the time scale associated with hydrogen - bond ( hb ) dynamics in the se relation is investigated .",
    "in fact , the rearrangement of the hb network in water is expected to play a critical role in determining its dynamical properties  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tetrahedrality due to the hb network increases considerably with decreasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "such highly structured tetrahedral network is associated with the hypothesized liquid - liquid transition between a high - density liquid and low - density liquid  @xcite , although this scenario is currently controversial  @xcite .",
    "thus , these facts necessitate an investigation of the role of hb dynamics in the se relation .",
    "we show that the se relation is preserved ( se preservation ) when we use the hb breakage time scales instead of @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the strong coupling between the diffusion constant @xmath2 and hb lifetime @xmath15 at any temperature .",
    "this preservation is attributed to the activated jumps of mobile molecules that characterize the translational diffusion .",
    "third , the origin of the observed se violation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the decoupling between the diffusion constant @xmath16 and @xmath6-relaxation time @xmath10 is elucidated . for this , non - gaussian parameters and four - point dynamic correlations are examined to probe the degree of spatially heterogeneity dynamic in supercooled water . here , the se violation / preservation is additionally demonstrated in terms of other significant time scales such as the stress relaxation and the mobile / immobile contributions of the dynamic heterogeneities . from these classifications of various time scales ,",
    "the degree of se violation is explained by the increase in the plateau modulus and the non - exponentiality of the stress correlation function upon supercooling .",
    "this elucidation for se violation is also correlated with the growing of non - gaussianity and dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "the translational mean square displacement ( msd ) was calculated at different temperatures ( see the methods section ) .",

    "the time evolution of @xmath20 at various temperatures is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_tcf]c .",

    "the fsc crossover is expected as a sign of the compressibility maximum locus ( `` widom line '' ) originating from the liquid - liquid transition .",
    "in fact , the observed @xmath21 k is in accord with the crossing temperature at @xmath27 g @xmath28 of the widom line determined in recent tip4p/2005 simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the crossover from @xmath29 to @xmath30 in the fractional se relation is similar to the experimental result  @xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the alternative expressions for the se relation are conventionally examined via @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the former formula employs the gaussian approximation @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath10 is characterized by @xmath11 , @xmath34 can play the role of the se relation .",
    "[ fig_tau]c shows the proportional relationship @xmath35 , which is consistent with the previous results in simple liquids  @xcite .",

    "the onset of the se violation is characterized by @xmath34 .",
    "we introduce the _ generalized _ se ratio @xmath36 with other significant time scales in supercooled water .",
    "first , we focus on the dynamics of hb breakage . the number of the non - broken hbs for all molecules @xmath37 was calculated in the time interval @xmath38 , and then the average number fraction @xmath39 was calculated .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_tcf]d ( see the detailed definitions of the hb and @xmath39 in the methods section ) .",

    "thus , we obtain a marked preservation of the se relation ( se preservation ) , @xmath41 at any temperature , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig_se]c .",
    "this se preservation @xmath42 implies that the appropriate time scale associated with the translational diffusion @xmath2 is not @xmath10 but should instead be the hb lifetime @xmath15 .",

[ fig_tcf]b , @xmath51 as well as @xmath45 increases slightly with decreasing temperature . instead of the maxwell model , the viscosity @xmath1 is determined not only by the stress relaxation time @xmath46 but also by the plateau modulus @xmath45 .",
    "this relationship will be clarified later .",
    "we additionally obtained another preservation of the se relation , @xmath54 at any temperature , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig_se]c .",
    "this observation implies that the hb breakage is correlated with the relaxation process of the local stress .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the se violation is possibly attributable to the heterogeneous dynamics , _",

    ", the value of @xmath68 is adjusted to the long time regimes of full msd at each temperature .",
    "for the temperature @xmath75 k , @xmath76   is chosen corresponding to the position at first shoulder of van hove function @xmath77 with @xmath78 , which represents the distribution of single - molecular displacement ( see the figs .",
    "[ fig_gs]a - c ) . at the time scale of @xmath79 ns , @xmath80",
    "is largely deviated from the gaussian form @xmath81\\exp(-r^2/4dt)$ ] .",
    "this deviation implies that the spatial distribution of single - molecular displacement becomes heterogeneous .",
