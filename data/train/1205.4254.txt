    "the relation between gauge theories and string theory has been the subject of many important studies in the last three decades .",
    "first , maldacena [ 1 ] proposed the ads / cft correspondence , therefore the ads / cft correspondence sometimes called maldacena duality . according to this conjecture there is a relation between a conformal field theory ( cft ) in @xmath2-dimensional space and a supergravity theory in @xmath3-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "maldacena suggests that a quantum string in @xmath3-dimensional ads space , mathematically is equivalent to the ordinary quantum field theory with conformal invariance in @xmath2-dimensional space - time which lives on the boundary of @xmath4 space . the preliminary formulation of maldacena are developed and completed by independent works of witten [ 2 ] and gubser , et al .",
    "the famous example of ads / cft correspondence is the relation between type iib string theory in @xmath5 space and @xmath6 super yang - mills gauge theory on the 4-dimensional boundary of @xmath7 space . for more studying about the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence and its applications see ref . [ 4 ] .",
    "one of the most interesting application of the ads / cft correspondence is to study of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a qgp or quark soup is a phase of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which exists at extremely high temperature or density .",
    "this phase consists of free quarks and gluons , which are several of the basic building blocks of matter .",
    "the qgp created at cern s super proton synchrotron ( sps ) firstly .",
    "current experiments at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are continuing this effort . nowadays",
    "scientists at brookhaven rhic have tentatively claimed to have created a qgp with an approximate temperature of 4 trillion degrees celsius .",
    "the study of the qgp is a testing ground for finite temperature field theory .",
    "such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe .",
    "already , there are many attempt to study qcd by using gauge / gravity duality which usually called ads / qcd correspondence where the @xmath6 super yang - mills ( sym ) plasma considered .",
    "the most important quantities of qgp are the shear viscosity , drag force and jet - quenching parameter .",
    "the shear viscosity is one of the important hydrodynamical quantities of qgp which relates to the important thermodynamical quantity so - called entropy , specially it is found that the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath8 to the entropy density @xmath9 had a universal value : @xmath10 [ 5 - 18 ] .",
    "however , for the several cases , this value may be enhanced or reduced [ 19 - 29 ] .",
    "for example , @xmath11 corrections in string theory enhance the value of @xmath12 , but higher derivative corrections may be reduced it . in this paper",
    "we use diffusion constant [ 5 ] to obtain the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density for the three - charged black hole in the stu model . also we include higher derivative correction .",
    "the stu model admits a chemical potential for the @xmath13 symmetry and this makes it more interesting .",
    "for instance , presence of a baryon number chemical potential for heavy quark in the context of ads / cft correspondence yields to introducing a macroscopic density of heavy quark baryons .",
    "already the shear viscosity in the stu background computed [ 9,10 ] and higher derivative effects of the five - dimensional gauged supergravity [ 30 ] applied on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy [ 31 ] .",
    "we should note that our paper is extension of the refs . [",
    "10 ] and [ 31 ] because we are going to consider the stu model with three different charges [ 32 ] , which corresponds to three different chemical potential , and arbitrary space curvature .",
    "the stu model is an example of @xmath0 , @xmath1 gauged supergravity theory which is dual to the @xmath6 sym theory with finite chemical potential .",
    "the solutions of @xmath14 supergravity may be solutions of supergravity theory with more supersymmetry .",
    "already the duality between gravity and @xmath14 gauged theory investigated and found that @xmath1 supergravity is an ideal laboratory [ 33 - 38 ] .",
    "therefore , it may be to consider the stu model as a gravity dual of a strongly coupled plasma . in order to avoid naked singularity of the bps black holes [ 37 ] , non - extremal black holes of five dimensional @xmath1 ads supergravity analyzed in the ref . [ 38 ] and found a lower bound on the non - extremality parameter where the corresponding non - extremal black hole has regular horizon .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath14 supergravity theory in five dimensions can be obtained by compaction of the eleven dimensional supergravity in a three - fold calabi - yau [ 39 ] . the advantage of kaluza - klein reductional dimension and reduction of supersymmetry to obtain five - dimensional @xmath1 gauged supergravity",
    "is better understanding the nature , also some calculation such as quantum correction is very difficult in the theory with more supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 gauged supergravity theory is a natural way to explore gauge / gravity duality , and three - charge non - extremal black holes are important thermal background for this correspondence .",
    "now , we called this duality as stu / qcd correspondence .",
    "the stu model describes a five - dimensional space - time which its four - dimensional boundary includes qcd . for these reasons we focused on the stu background and studied the problem of the drag force and jet - quenching parameter [ 40 - 43 ] .",
    "the calculation of energy loss of moving heavy charged particle through a thermal medium known as the drag force .",
    "one can consider a moving heavy quark ( such as charm and bottom quarks ) through the thermal plasma with the momentum @xmath15 , mass @xmath16 and constant velocity @xmath17 , which is influenced by an external force @xmath18 .",
    "so , one can write the equation of motion as @xmath19 , where in the non - relativistic motion @xmath20 , and in the relativistic motion @xmath21 , also @xmath22 is called friction coefficient . in order to obtain drag force",
    ", one can consider two special cases .",
    "the first case is the constant momentum ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "so , for the non - relativistic motion , one can obtain @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the drag force coefficient @xmath25 will be obtained . in the second case ,",
    "external force is zero , so one can find @xmath26 . in another word , by measuring the ratio @xmath27 or @xmath28",
    "one can determine friction coefficient @xmath22 without any dependence on mass @xmath16 .",
    "these methods lead us to obtain the drag force for a moving heavy quark in the thermal plasma .",
    "the moving heavy quark in context of qcd has dual picture in the string theory where an open string attached to the d - brane and stretched to the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the existence of the black hole is necessary for considering the finite temperature field theory .",
    "also the existence of the d - brane is necessary for considering the quark flavor .",
    "moreover the existence of the rotating black holes in the five dimensional space is necessary for considering the finite chemical potential field theory . already the issue of the drag force considered in the @xmath29 super yang - mills thermal plasma with several interesting backgrounds [ 44 - 50 ] . in the ref . [",
    "45 ] the problem of the drag force for the arbitrary metric studied , and the r - charged black d3-brane background as an example considered .",
    "this is just stu model with three different charges after the special re - scaling which explain later in this paper .",
    "therefore our work differs from the ref . [",
    "45 ] , so we do nt like to use any re - scaling on the original metric .",
    "another important property of the qgp is called the jet - quenching parameter ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the knowledge about this parameter increases our understanding about the qgp . in that case the jet - quenching parameter obtained by calculating the expectation value of a closed light - like wilson loop and using the dipole approximation [ 50 ] . in order to calculate this parameter in qcd",
    "one needs to use perturbation theory .",
    "but , by using ads / cft correspondence the jet - quenching parameter calculated in non - perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "this calculations were already performed in the @xmath6 sym thermal plasma with several interesting backgrounds [ 51 - 57 ] . also the effect of higher derivative corrections such as gauss - bonnet on the drag force and",
    "the jet - quenching parameter has been studied [ 57 , 58 ] .",
    "hence , in the ref .",
    "[ 53 ] we calculated the jet - quenching parameter in stu model include higher derivative correction and external electric field .",
    "we represent also our results in this paper . in the ref . [ 40 ] we considered the moving quark at @xmath1 supergravity and obtained the drag force for the first time . in that paper we considered the non - extremal black hole with three equal charge and",
    "have shown that our results at near - extremal limit agree with the case of @xmath6 sym theory . then in the ref . [ 41 ] we considered the non - extremal black hole with one charge and calculated the drag force for the three different spaces : three dimensional sphere , a pseudo - sphere and a flat space .",
    "these cases are just special case of stu model .",
    "so , in the ref .",
    "[ 42 ] we extended our previous works to the general case of stu background , where the non - extremal black hole has three different charges .",
    "also we studied the quark - anti quark ( @xmath31 ) configuration and introduced rotating @xmath31 pair in the stu background .",
    "finally in the ref .",
    "[ 43 ] we compute the jet quenching parameter for the case of the non - extremal black hole with three different charge .",
    "we generalize that work to the case of arbitrary curvature and obtain general expression of the jet - quenching parameter in this review article .",
    "there are also interesting hydrodynamical quantity such as thermal and electrical conductivity which can be calculated from gauge / gravity duality . in the recent work [ 59 ] the thermal and electrical conductivity calculated in presence of non - zero chemical potential and found that conductivities for gauge theories dual to r - charged black hole in @xmath32 behaves in a universal manner . in the ref .",
    "[ 59 ] r - charged black holes in arbitrary dimension considered and electrical conductivity computed .",
    "we use results of the ref . [ 49 ] to write an expression for electrical conductivity as a hydrodynamical property of the qgp . in the ref .",
    "[ 60 ] the stu model used to describe a relativistic fluid with multiple charges , and some transport coefficients relevant to the physics of the qgp calculated .",
    "also in the ref .",
    "[ 60 ] a time - dependent version of the stu model dual to a boost - invariant expanding plasma presented which may be useful for future studies based on this paper . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate some important properties of the qgp in the stu model with non - extremal black hole and three different charges .",
    "indeed , we review some of the previous results and also add some new things , and collect all of them in this review article .",
    "therefore , in section 2 we review basic properties of the stu model and obtain corresponding general relativity equations .",
    "in section 3 we extract thermodynamical quantities of the stu model , and in section 4 we compute the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density .",
    "then , in section 5 we consider the problem of the drag force for the several configurations . in section 6",
    "we generalized computation of the jet - quenching parameter to the case of stu black hole with arbitrary curvature space .",
    "finally in section 7 we summarized our results and give conclusion .",
    "the stu model is the special form of the @xmath14 supergravity in several dimensions .",
    "this model has generally 8-charged ( 4 electric and 4 magnetic ) non - extremal black hole . however , there are many situations with less than charges such as four - charged and three - charged black holes . in that case",
    "there is great difference between the three - charged and four - charged black holes .",
    "for example if there are only 3 charges , then the entropy vanishes ( except in the non - bps case ) .",
    "so , one really needs four charges to get a regular black hole . in 5 dimensions the situation is different and actually much simpler ,",
    "there is no distinction between bps and non - bps branch .",
    "so , in 5 dimensions the three - charged configurations are the most interesting ones [ 61 ] .",
    "therefore , we begin with the three - charged non - extremal black hole solution in @xmath14 gauged supergravity which is called stu model and described by the following solution [ 62 ] , @xmath33 where , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the constant ads radius and relates to the coupling constant via @xmath36 ( also , coupling constant relates to the cosmological constant via @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the radial coordinate along the black hole , so the boundary of ads space located at @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 on the d - brane ) .",
    "the black hole horizon specified by @xmath41 which is obtained from @xmath42 . in the stu model",
    "there are three real scalar fields as @xmath43 , which satisfy the following condition , @xmath44 . in another word ,",
    "if we set @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , then there is the @xmath48 condition .",
    "for the three r - charges @xmath49 , in the equation ( 2 ) , there is an overall factor such as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is called non - extremality parameter and @xmath52 are related to the three independent electrical charges of the black hole .",
    "finally , the factor of @xmath53 indicates the space curvature , so the metric ( 1 ) includes a @xmath54 ( three dimensional sphere ) for @xmath55 , a pseudo - sphere for @xmath56 and a flat space for @xmath57 .",
    "so , for @xmath55 , @xmath57 and @xmath56 one can write respectively , @xmath58      by introducing the new variable , @xmath59 one can obtain the following independent christophel symbols , @xmath60 where the index @xmath61 refers to the angular components",
    ". this yields us to the following non - zero components of riemann tensor , @xmath62 hence , we can extract the following components of the ricci tensor , @xmath63 finally one can find the ricci scalar as the following , @xmath64.\\ ] ] we can realize the relation ( 4 ) by computing the field strengths of the abelian gauge field which obtained by using components of the ricci tensor as @xmath65 [ 10 ] , and comparing it with the gauge field equation of motion [ 38 ] .",
    "now , we would like to discuss horizon structure of the metric ( 1 ) .",
    "in the ref . [ 38 ] the appropriate conditions for the existence of horizon in the stu model with @xmath55 extracted . here",
    ", we give similar discussion for arbitrary @xmath53 and obtain exact relation for the black hole horizon .",
    "the @xmath42 reduced to the following equation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "a possible solutions of the equation ( 9 ) is given by , @xmath69 where we defined , @xmath70     for small black hole charges . ]",
    "the @xmath71 denotes outer horizon , while the @xmath72 denotes inner horizon .",
    "other solutions of the equation ( 9 ) are imaginary . in the fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 we draw horizon structure of stu black hole for different space curvatures .     and @xmath55 for small black hole charges.,title=\"fig : \" ] and @xmath55 for small black hole charges.,title=\"fig : \" ]    however , with @xmath73 the function @xmath74 has two extremum at @xmath75 where @xmath76 , so @xmath77 is not acceptable region . therefore , in order to have at least one horizon in the positive region it should be to have @xmath78 which implies that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . in order to find @xmath81 , we restrict ourself to the following cases , ( i ) @xmath82 which implies @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "we can see that the space - time including pseudo sphere ( @xmath56 ) yields to imaginary non - extremality parameter at critical point . in the second case",
    "one can obtain @xmath93 which yields to the following critical value for the non - extremality parameter , @xmath94 therefore , we success to obtain exact expression for horizon radius and calculate approximate values for the non - extremality parameter . in the next step",
    "we add higher derivative terms and give horizon radius , and try to obtain critical value of the non - extremality parameter .",
    "the higher derivative corrections to r - charged @xmath7 black holes studied originally for the black hole with three equal charges [ 63 ] where four - derivative corrections to the bosonic sector of five - dimensional @xmath1 gauged supergravity considered . then , the same problem in the stu model to linear order of the four derivative terms constructed [ 30 ] .",
    "now , we would like to extend this work to the case of three different charges [ 42 ] .",
    "in that case the metric ( 1 ) reminds unchange but , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the small constant parameter corresponding to the higher derivative terms . in that case the modified horizon radius for the case of @xmath55 is given by the following expression , @xmath97}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & c_{1}\\frac{2(\\prod_{i}(1+\\frac{q_{i}}{r_{0h}^2}))^{\\frac{1}{3}}(\\frac{13}{3}\\sum q_{i}-3r_{0h}^{2})+3r^{2}}{576 \\left[(\\prod_{i}(1+\\frac{q_{i}}{r_{0h}^2}))^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\frac{1}{3}\\sum q_{i}-2r_{0h}^{2})-r^{2}\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the horizon radius without higher derivative corrections which is given by the equation ( 10 ) .",
    "we should note that in order to obtain the expression ( 15 ) we removed @xmath51 by using @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath55 solutions is more appropriate to studies of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic regimes of the theory , and also have interesting application in the horizon structure of the small black holes .",
    "just as previous subsection it is interesting to find a critical value @xmath99 . by using @xmath82 approximation",

    "in this section we are going to compute some thermodynamical quantities in the stu model with three different black hole charges for the arbitrary spaces .",
    "the thermodynamics of the stu model has been studied for special cases [ 10 , 38 , 64 , 65 ] .",
    "so , the main goal of this section is to generalize previous studies and review the thermodynamics of the stu black hole solution generally .",

    "numerically , and under near boundary approximation , we draw graph of the jet - quenching parameter in terms of the constant electric field and find that the constant electric field increases the value of the jet - quenching parameter . in the fig .",
    "18 we draw the jet - quenching parameter in terms of the constant electric field for the large black hole charge .    , @xmath256 , @xmath487 and @xmath260 @xmath350 .",
    "the solid line represents the case of @xmath178 .",
    "the dotted line represents the case of @xmath488 .",
    "the dashed line represents the case of @xmath145 .",
    "it show that the jet - quenching parameter increased by the constant electric field . ]      finally , in absence of any external field , we would like to calculate the effect of higher derivative terms on the jet - quenching parameter . in that case",
    "the jet - quenching parameter obtained as the following expression , @xmath489 where , @xmath490 also , we used relations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) for the case of @xmath145 .",
    "one can study near boundary behavior of the jet - quenching parameter and find that the higher derivative terms include at @xmath491 . in that case",
    "we find that the higher derivative terms decrease the value of the jet - quenching parameter .",
    "so , for the fixed parameters such as @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath260 @xmath350 and small black hole charge , we obtain @xmath492 to have positive jet - quenching parameter , which is agree with the result of the subsection 5.4 .",
    "for example with the above fixed parameters and @xmath493 one can obtain @xmath494 @xmath464 which is approximately value of the jet - quenching parameter of the @xmath6 sym theory . in order to obtain @xmath468 @xmath464 the corresponding higher derivative parameter should be @xmath495 at @xmath466 .",
    "+ again , we can use re - scaling ( 31 ) and obtain , @xmath496^{-1},\\ ] ] where , @xmath497 , \\nonumber\\\\ h&=&1+\\frac{q}{r^{2}}-\\frac{c_{1 } q r_{0}^{4}}{24r^{2}r^{4}(r^{2}+q)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and radius @xmath162 is the root of the @xmath147 from relation ( 140 ) .",
    "the equation ( 139 ) may be solved numerically , and explicit expression of the jet - quenching parameter can be obtained .",
    "but it is clear that the effect of higher derivative correction is to decrease the jet - quenching parameter .",
    "one can check this statement by taking @xmath115 limit . in this limit",
    "the jet - quenching parameter derived as , @xmath498^{-1},\\ ] ] where , @xmath499 in that case it is necessary that @xmath500 . comparing equation ( 141 ) with the jet - quenching parameter of the @xmath6 sym theory",
    "tell us that the effect of @xmath96 is decreasing the jet - quenching parameter .",
    "in this paper we studied some important problems to understand the nature of qgp more exactly .",
    "indeed , we considered thermal qgp include a chemical potential .",
    "this chemical potential comes from @xmath1 supergravity in 5 dimensions .",
    "this theory contains a non - extremal black hole with three electrical charges and well known as stu model .",
    "first of all we reviewed properties of stu model and extracted their equations .",
    "we studied thermodynamics of stu background and extracted the hawking temperature , entropy density , specific heat and free energy of qgp .",
    "we found that the black hole charge increase the value of specific heat . in order to compare our results with the @xmath6 sym plasma we used special re - scaling which actually was a transformation to the flat space .",
    "+ we investigated the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density and found that the universality of @xmath12 is valid also in stu model .",
    "also , we found that the shear viscosity is decreasing for the cases of one - charged and three - charged black holes and is increasing for the case of two - charged black hole .",
    "we discussed briefly about thermal and electrical conductivities of qgp .",
    "+ then , we considered problem of the drag force and found energy loss of single quark and quark - antiquark pair .",
    "we showed that the value of the drag force enhanced due to the black hole charges .",
    "also we calculated diffusion coefficient of the quark for the three special cases of one , two and three - charged black holse .",
    "we found that the effect of constant electric field is decreasing of the drag force but higher derivative terms may be increases or decreases the value of drag force .",
    "it depend to the value of higher derivative parameter . here",
    ", we found interesting relation between drag force of the single quark ( 72 ) and entropy density ( 20 ) which is @xmath501 .",
    "this relationship is valid also in the case of @xmath6 sym plasma .",
    "we discuss about this relation and also other interesting relations end of this section .",
    "+ finally we studied the jet - quenching parameter and found that the jet - quenching parameter like the drag force enhanced due to the black hole charges .",
    "it means that the energy of the string in @xmath1 thermal plasma is larger than the string in @xmath6 thermal plasma , hence the string in @xmath1 thermal plasma lose more energy than the string in @xmath6 thermal plasma .",
    "in this case we found that the constant electric field enhances the jet - quenching parameter , but higher derivative terms decreases the value of jet - quenching parameter .",
    "we examine our solution for three special cases of one , two and three - charged black holes .",
    "all cases yield to the same value of the jet - quenching parameter for the small black hole charge .",
    "however , thermodynamical stability allow to choose the black hole charge of order @xmath502 .",
    "in that case we found @xmath503 and @xmath504 for one , two and three - charged black hole respectively .",
    "these values of the jet - quenching parameter are far from experiments of rhic ( experimental data tell us that ( @xmath505 ) . there is no worry for this statement because the temperature of the @xmath1 supergravity theory should given smaller than the @xmath6 sym theory . in that case with the temperature about @xmath469 we obtained the jet - quenching parameter in the experimental range .",
    "+ let us now compare some interesting ratios of qgp quantities .",
    "first , we summarize results of the @xmath6 sym theory .",
    "the entropy density , drag force of moving heavy quark and jet - quenching parameter of @xmath6 sym qgp are given by , @xmath506 where @xmath507 is a constant and @xmath508 is t hooft coupling .",
    "now , it is clear that , @xmath509 it is interesting to study such relations in the @xmath1 supergravity thermal plasma .",
    "we obtained entropy density ( 20 ) , drag force of moving heavy quark ( 72 ) and jet - quenching parameter ( 125 ) of @xmath1 qgp .",
    "we can draw graph of @xmath510 , @xmath511 and @xmath512 to investigate behavior of these ratios . in the fig .",
    "19 we give @xmath510 in terms of the temperature and find linear behavior of @xmath216 .",
    "so , it is in agreement of @xmath6 case , therefore we can claim @xmath513 is valid at the both @xmath6 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "+ also we draw @xmath511 and @xmath512 in terms of the temperature in the fig .",
    "20 , and find that @xmath511 yields to a constant . also @xmath512 has linear behavior of @xmath216 which are in agreement of @xmath6 case . + in the recent works a general non - extremal rotating charged ads black holes in five - dimensional @xmath13 gauged supergravity [ 78 ] and also higher dimensional one studied [ 79 , 80 ] .",
