    "[ [ section ] ]    in this work , we have analyzed the connection between the conformal quantum mechanics @xcite and the wigner - heisenberg algebra @xcite . with an appropriate relationship between the coupling constant @xmath64 and real constant @xmath63",
    "one can identify the wigner hamiltonian with the conformal hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "the important result is that the introduction of the wigner - heisenberg algebra in the conformal quantum mechanics is still consistent with the conformal symmetry .",
    "the spectrum for the casimir operator , the hamiltonian @xmath14 and the ladder operators depend on the parity operator .",
    "we also investigated the supersymmetrization of this model , in that case we obtain a new spectra for the supersymmetric and conformal hamiltonian of the calogero interaction s type . in this case the spectrum for the super - casimir operator and the superhamiltonian depend also on the parity operator .",
    "one motivation for this work is the future applications in the problems related to black holes @xcite and the construction of a supersymmetric quantum mechanics with conformal symmetry for the n - particles in the wigner - heisenberg picture .",
    "let us point out that one can consider the same analysis implemented in this work for the dirac oscillator , getting a generalization of the works @xcite .    finally , it would be interesting to investigate the possible connection between the hidden supersymmetry in the wh - algebra structure and the explicit supersymmetry implemented in the section 4 , work in this direction is under current research .",
