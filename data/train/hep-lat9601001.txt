    "the relation between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in gauge theories has been a subject of continuous interest . the picture of chiral symmetry breaking suggested by banks and casher @xcite relates the chiral condensate to the average density of small eigenvalues of the dirac operator in the fluctuating background of the gauge field .",
    "the appearance of small eigenvalues in turn can be related to the fact that the qcd vacuum is populated by instanton configurations @xcite .",
    "the pure qcd without quarks undergoes a phase transition at some temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to see whether this transition affects the behavior of small eigenvalues of the dirac operator in such a way that the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this motivates a monte carlo study of qcd with quenched quarks . in this paper",
    "we analyze the recent result @xcite of such a study .",
    "unlike previous similar works @xcite the authors looked at the value of the chiral condensate in each of the @xmath8 symmetric directions in the complex plane in which the polyakov loop acquires a nonzero expectation value above @xmath0 .",
    "it was found that :    * the chiral condensate @xmath9 vanishes above @xmath0 in the phase with @xmath5 . * in the phase with the @xmath3 the @xmath9 is nonzero for some range of @xmath10  !    the last point ( b ) contradicts a naive expectation that the vanishing of the @xmath9 has something to do with the rearrangement of the qcd equilibrium state at @xmath0 , e.g. , a suppression of the instanton configurations in the deconfined phase . in this paper",
    "we show that this result can indeed be explained very naturally if one takes into account _ only _ the effect of the boundary conditions on the quark fields in the euclidean time . nevertheless the fact ( a ) that the vanishing of @xmath11 coincides with @xmath0 tells us that the rearrangement of the qcd equilibrium state at @xmath0 also plays a role .",
    "the partition function of the qcd without quarks can be written as a euclidean path integral : @xmath12\\};\\qquad   s=\\int_0^{1/t } \\int d^3\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] an order parameter distinguishing the confined and the deconfined phases is the expectation value of the polyakov loop : @xmath13 the value of @xmath1 is invariant under a gauge transformation periodic in the euclidean time : @xmath14 . however , the action @xmath15 is also invariant under aperiodic gauge transformations : @xmath16 with @xmath17 , which do not upset the boundary conditions on @xmath18 because @xmath19 commutes with all matrices in the gauge group .",
    "the value of the polyakov loop acquires a phase @xmath20 after such a transformation .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath8 symmetry transformation in an effective theory of the polyakov loops .    at small temperatures the expectation value of the polyakov loop is zero and",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry is exact . above @xmath0",
    "the polyakov loop acquires a non - vanishing expectation value which can be related to the liberation of color @xcite .",
    "= 1.8 in = 1.8 in    ( a)(b )    to analyze the results of the monte carlo simulation it is helpful to consider a probability distribution of the polyakov loop in a large but finite volume . it can be calculated as a histogram @xcite : for each configuration one finds the averaged ( over @xmath21 ) @xmath1 .",
    "the configuration then contributes a unit to the height of the histogram at this @xmath1 . the qualitative behavior near @xmath0 of this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3 ] .",
    "there are 4 peaks . at low @xmath4",
    "the peak at @xmath22 is taller .",
    "most of the configurations have very small @xmath1 near the origin . at @xmath23",
    "the 3 degenerate peaks at nonzero @xmath1 are ( roughly ) of the same height as the peak at the origin . at higher @xmath4 the @xmath8 peaks are taller .",
    "the chiral condensate is measured by averaging the inverse of the dirac operator over the gauge configurations . at high @xmath4 one",
    "has a choice of averaging over ensembles of configurations clustered near each of the @xmath8 peaks .",
    "we refer to these ensembles as @xmath8 phases .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the result is different in the phases @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "due to the @xmath8 symmetry an ensemble of gauge configurations in the phase @xmath3 can be mapped onto the ensemble at @xmath24 by an aperiodic gauge transformation ( [ uzu ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8 phases of pure qcd are equivalent . however , the spectrum of the dirac operator is not invariant under such a transformation .",
    "minima of the effective potential by the fermion determinant contribution .",
    "] we conclude that different behavior of the chiral condensate in the two phases is entirely due to the effect of the aperiodic gauge transformation on the spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "the action of the gauge transformation ( [ uzu ] ) on the fermion fields changes the boundary conditions in the euclidean time direction from antiperiodic : @xmath25 to twisted : @xmath26 the eigenvalue problem for the dirac operator is defined by the differential equation : @xmath27 with functions @xmath28 satisfying given b.c .",
    "the b.c . in this problem are different in the phases with @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , qualitatively one can see that the effect of a nontrivial @xmath8 phase on the b.c . tends to lower the eigenvalues , because of less twisting required of @xmath29 .",
    "it is transparent if you consider as an example the free dirac operator , i.e. @xmath30 . in this case , the spectrum in the phase @xmath5 is given by : @xmath31 . while in the @xmath3 phase",
    "it becomes : @xmath32 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue moves from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "to find the dependence of the spectrum on @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath18 is a very difficult problem .",
    "fortunately , the only information we need about the spectrum is the density of small eigenvalues @xmath35 which is related to the chiral condensate by @xcite : @xmath36    to go further we need to make some approximations . as our first approximation we neglect the euclidean time dependence of the gauge configurations responsible for small eigenvalues .",
    "this is not altogether unreasonable approximation at least at @xmath4 of the order of @xmath0 and higher for the following two reasons .",
    "first , it is the infrared behavior of the gauge fields that is responsible for the small eigenvalues .",
    "it is known , that the ir behavior of qcd at high @xmath4 is given by a 3-dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "second , the correlation length at the first order phase transition in pure qcd may be large compared to @xmath37  the extent in the time direction . for the @xmath38 theory",
    "this is suggested by the fact that in the potts model , to which this transition is related by universality arguments , the transition is very weakly first order . for the @xmath7 theory",
    "the correlation length is infinite at @xmath0 and the theory _ is _",
    "effectively 3-dimensional at @xmath0 .    in this approximation",
    "we can separate @xmath39 and @xmath21 dependence in the eigenfunctions : @xmath40 .",
    "thus ( [ ev ] ) reduces to the eigenvalue problem for a _",
    "three_-dimensional operator : @xmath41\\psi_n(\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$ } ) = \\lambda\\psi_n(\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$})\\ ] ] for each @xmath42 , where the gauge fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 depend only on @xmath21 .",
    "the values of @xmath42 are determined by the b.c . in the euclidean time : @xmath45    to find the density of small eigenvalues ( or , chiral condensate ) for the operator ( [ ev3d ] ) we use another approximation known as the ( gaussian ) random matrix model @xcite .",
    "we choose a basis @xmath46 of @xmath47 functions can ( but need not necessarily ) be thought of as the exact zero modes of each of @xmath47 individual instantons and @xmath48 being the overlap matrix . in 3d",
    "a similar role can , perhaps , be played by periodic instantons or dyons . ] ( the same for all gauge field configurations and all @xmath42 ) and write the _",
    "three_-dimensional dirac operator in this basis : @xmath49 where the @xmath48 is a complex @xmath50 matrix .",
    "then one can replace the averaging over the gauge fields by averaging over the elements of the matrix @xmath48 .",
    "the main approximation of the model , which proves to be very good ( and , probably , exact in some sense ) in 4d @xcite , is that the probability distribution is gaussian . in other words ,",
    "we calculate : @xmath51 this is actually an approximation to the full partition function of qcd with @xmath52 flavors of _ dynamical _ fermions .",
    "we will be interested , however , in the limit @xmath53  quenched fermions .",
    "in fact , one can check that @xmath52 cancels out in our final results anyway .",
    "therefore , to simplify the formulae we shall put @xmath54 .",
    "it is also convenient to view each matsubara mode as a flavor with a matsubara mass @xmath42 . from @xmath55",
    "we can obtain the chiral condensate in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the volume of the 3-space .",
    "the calculation @xcite of ( [ z ] ) is similar in spirit to the mean field calculation in the large  @xmath47 sigma models ( hubbard - stratonovich transformation ) .",
    "we introduce a new random matrix  @xmath58 , the integral over which can be calculated in the saddle point approximation at large @xmath47 .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the determinant as a grassmann integral : @xmath59 the spinors @xmath60 carry an implicit index @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "integration over @xmath63 can be carried out which creates the four - fermion term : @xmath64 this term can be rewritten using another auxiliary random matrix @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a diagonal matrix @xmath68 .    the integral over grassmann variables",
    "can be then performed : @xmath69    at large @xmath47 the saddle point equation for the matrix @xmath58 is : @xmath70^{-1 } = 0.\\ ] ] this has a solution in the form of a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues @xmath71 that satisfy ( we put m=0 here ) : @xmath72 this equation is analogous to the well known gap equation in the large @xmath47 sigma models . a nontrivial solution @xmath73 exists only for those @xmath74 for which : @xmath75 .    using ( [ pbpz ] ) and ( [ zy ] ) we find that the chiral condensate is given by : @xmath76 in the saddle point approximation at large @xmath47 using ( [ gap ] )",
    "we find : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we see that the chiral condensate vanishes ( continuously : @xmath80 in this approximation ) when @xmath81 , in other words , when the temperature exceeds : @xmath82 where @xmath2 is mod @xmath83 .",
    "depends on @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath84 one should expect @xmath85 .",
    "the equation  ( [ tchi ] ) then defines @xmath86 self - consistently .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect , though , that @xmath87 near @xmath0 . ]",
    "this result is in accordance with our expectation that nonzero @xmath2 favors chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "our model at @xmath5 is similar to a model suggested in @xcite where only the lowest matsubara frequency was taken into account .",
    "this makes sense since we are interested in the behavior of small eigenvalues of the dirac operator .",
    "indeed , only the band @xmath88 of the eigenvalues contributes in ( [ pbp ] ) when @xmath4 is close to @xmath86 and @xmath89 . in our case",
    "keeping all matsubara frequencies ensures periodicity in @xmath90 .",
    "we analyzed a recent monte carlo observation that the chiral condensate @xmath91 does not vanish in some interval above @xmath0 in quenched qcd in the phase with @xmath92 .",
    "this fact suggests that the rearrangement of the qcd equilibrium state at @xmath0 ( deconfinement ) is not the only source of the restoration of the chiral symmetry in quenched qcd .",
    "we calculated ( approximately ) the chiral condensate at finite @xmath4 taking into account the dependence of the spectrum of the dirac operator on the b.c .",
    "for the quark fields in the euclidean time .",
    "we found that the @xmath91 vanishes continuously at a temperature @xmath93 which depends on the phase of the polyakov loop ( [ tchi ] ) .",
    "this suggests the following interpretation of the result @xcite .",
    "as we approach the deconfinement transition from @xmath10 side the chiral symmetry breaking in the @xmath3 phase occurs earlier , at a temperature @xmath94 .",
    "the chiral condensate is zero in the @xmath5 phase because @xmath95 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , the result  @xcite suggests that @xmath0 is only about 7% lower than @xmath97 , while in our approximation @xmath98 is about @xmath99 of @xmath97 . at @xmath0",
    "the @xmath8 phases become metastable and at lower temperatures the single @xmath22 phase dominates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : z3 ] ) .",
    "being cavalier enough , one can conjecture that the effect of this transition on @xmath91 can be taken into account very roughly by averaging over 3 values of @xmath2 .",
    "this would lead to a relation between the condensate just below @xmath0 and the condensate in the @xmath3 phase just above @xmath0 : @xmath100 which does not seem to be in a gross contradiction with @xcite .",
    "in other words , 3 phases of the polyakov loop `` mix together '' below @xmath0 .    in a picture of the chiral phase transition in the quenched qcd suggested here",
    "the restoration of the chiral symmetry at finite @xmath4 is mainly due to the effect of the b.c . in the euclidean time suppressing small eigenvalues of the dirac operator .",
    "the rearrangement of the qcd equilibrium state plays a secondary role .",
    "this goes in line with the fact that , as far as we know , the instanton density behaves rather smoothly across the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "theory with adjoint quarks . ]",
    "the effect of the b.c . in the @xmath5 phase is stronger than in the @xmath3 phase and in the low temperature @xmath22 phase . to put this into another perspective",
    "one can note that antiperiodic boundary conditions for the quark fields are related to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "the fact that pauli blocking leads to chiral symmetry restoration is rather well known in various models of particle and nuclear physics .",
    "another interesting consequence of ( [ tchi ] ) is that in the @xmath7 gauge theory : @xmath101 .",
    "this means that the @xmath91 stays nonzero for all @xmath4 in the @xmath102 phase !",
    "this result can be argued for also beyond the approximation of the random matrix model . recall that the theory at very high @xmath84 becomes effectively 3-dimensional .",
    "moreover , fermions which would `` decouple '' in the @xmath5 phase do not in the @xmath103 phase because the b.c .",
    "are periodic .",
    "thus the value of @xmath91 is determined by the 3-dimensional @xmath7 gauge theory at _ zero _ temperature .",
    "the value of the @xmath91 is nonzero in such a theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath104 purely on dimensional grounds .",
    "this means that the chiral condensate in the @xmath7 theory in the @xmath103 phase at @xmath105 is of the order : @xmath106    recently there have been two attempts @xcite to describe the data @xcite using a nambu - jona - lasinio model . with some tuning of parameters it is possible to achieve a reasonable fit to the data in the model @xcite .",
    "the present paper emphasizes the role of the behavior of small eigenvalues as a function of @xmath2 and in this respect differs from a somewhat phenomenological approach of @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain new results , for example ,  ( [ tchi ] ) or  ( [ pbpsu2 ] )",
    ".    it would be interesting to test these results in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "for example , one can consider b.c .",
    "conditions on fermions with an arbitrary twist .",
    "this would add to our knowledge of the mechanism of the chiral symmetry restoration in qcd .",
