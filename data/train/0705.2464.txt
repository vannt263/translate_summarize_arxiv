    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a highly compressible turbulent , magnetized fluid , exhibiting density fluctuations on all observable scales .",
    "it has been long realized by many researchers that incompressible hydrodynamic , i.e. kolmogorov , description is inadequate for such a medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "scaling relations , if they were obtained for the interstellar gas , would be very helpful for addressing many problems , including the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation .",
    "attempts to include effects of compressibility into the interstellar turbulence description can be dated as far back as the work by @xcite .",
    "there a simple model based on a hierarchy of clouds was presented . according to this picture every large cloud",
    "consists a certain number of smaller clouds , which contain even smaller clouds .",
    "for such a model @xcite proposed a relation between subsequent levels of hierarchy @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the average density inside a cloud at level @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mean size of that cloud , 3 is the number of dimensions , and @xmath8 is constant that reflects the degree of compression at each level @xmath6 .",
    "the kolmogorov energy spectrum ( @xmath9 ) follows from the assumption of a constant specific energy transfer rate @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , in a compressible fluid , the volume energy transfer rate is constant in a statistical steady state @xmath11    in an important , but not sufficiently appreciated work , @xcite ( henceforth , f96 ) incorporated above hierarchical model with energy transfer in compressible fluid to obtain the scaling relations for compressible turbulence . by combining the equations ( [ eqn : hierar ] ) and ( [ eqn : enden ] ) @xcite presented the following set of scaling relations in terms of the degree of compression @xmath8 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the column density of the fluctuation with the scale @xmath15 and the mass of the cloud of size @xmath15 .",
    "the fluctuations of velocities in f96 model entail the spectrum of velocities @xmath16 .    in the spirit of f96 model , @xcite proposed to use the density - weighted velocity @xmath0 as a new quantity , for which the kolmogorov scaling for second order structure functions ( sfs ) can be restored ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : enden ] ) in compressible hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "their hydrodynamic simulations provided for @xmath2 spectrum close to kolmogorov and the third order structure function that scales in proportion to distance .",
    "will the f96 model be valid for compressible _ strongly magnetized _ turbulence ?",
    "this is the major question that we address in this paper .",
    "we used an second - order - accurate essentially nonoscillatory ( eno ) scheme ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for details ) to solve the ideal isothermal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in a periodic box with maintaining the @xmath17 constraint numerically .",
    "we drove the turbulence at wave scale @xmath18 ( 2.5 times smaller than the size of the box ) using a random solenoidal large - scale driving acceleration .",
    "this scale defines the injection scale in our models .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath19 is maintained to be approximately unity , so that @xmath20 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the rms velocity of the system and @xmath21 as the alfvn velocity in the same units .",
    "the time @xmath22 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath23 ) and the length in units of @xmath24 , the scale of the energy injection .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath25 .",
    "initially @xmath26 .",
    "we use units in which the alfvn speed @xmath27 and @xmath28 initially . the values of @xmath29 have been chosen to be similar to those observed in the ism turbulence . for our calculations we assumed that @xmath30 . in this case , the sound speed is the controlling parameter , and basically two regimes can exist : supersonic and subsonic .",
    "note that within our model , supersonic means low @xmath31 , i.e. the magnetic pressure dominates , and subsonic means high @xmath31 , i.e. the gas pressure dominates .",
    "we present results for selected 3d numerical experiments of compressible mhd turbulence with a strong magnetic field for sonic mach numbers @xmath32 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the alfvnic mach number @xmath35 .",
    "mach numbers are defined as the mean value of the ratio of the absolute value of the local velocity @xmath20 to the local value of the characteristic speed @xmath36 or @xmath37 ( for the sonic and alfvnic mach number , respectively ) . to study effects of magnetization we also performed superalfvnic experiments with @xmath38 .",
    "all models were calculated with the resolution 512@xmath39 up to 6 dynamical times .",
    "in figure  [ fig : spectra ] we present the spectra for velocity @xmath20 and density - weighted velocity @xmath40 for two subalfvnic highly magnetized , i.e. low-@xmath31 , models .",
    "naturally , for subsonic model the differences between spectra for @xmath20 and @xmath41 are marginal and both spectra correspond to kolmogorov s @xmath42 scaling ( see subplot in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "however , we can see that for the supersonic case , the velocity spectrum gets steeper .",
    "the steepening corresponds to @xmath43 ( from @xmath44 ) . at the same time",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath41 matches well the kolmogorov slope .    in the original kolmogorov theory (",
    "* hereafter k41 ) it was shown that the spectral index of the third order structure function ( sf ) , e.g. structure function of @xmath41 , @xmath45 , should be equal 1 , i.e. @xmath46 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sf3rd ] we show the sfs of the third order for velocity and for density - weighted velocity for supersonic model .",
    "we checked , that for subsonic motions , for both @xmath20 and @xmath41 , the index @xmath47 is indeed , close to unity .",
    "for the supersonic case , @xmath47 increases with the mach number for @xmath20 , but stays the unity for @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sf3rd ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the kolmogorov universality is preserved for supersonic mhd turbulence when density weighting is applied .",
    "a proper description of turbulence requires higher moments ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "those characterize intermittency , which is in the original k41 model is not accounted for .",
    "a substantial progress in understanding turbulence intermittency is related to a discovery by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter sl94 ) , who found a simple form for the scaling of the spectral index @xmath48 of higher order longitudinal correlations @xmath49 \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{l } } |^p \\rangle \\sim l^{\\zeta_p}$ ] . while in k41 model @xmath50 , sl94 provides @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is related to the scaling of the velocity @xmath53 , @xmath54 is related to the energy cascade rate @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the dimension of the dissipative structures . in hydrodynamic incompressible turbulence , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for mhd turbulence",
    "the dissipation happens in current sheets , which are two - dimensional dissipative structures , corresponding to @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "thus , for subsonic mhd turbulence we expect @xmath60 for both velocity and the density weighted velocity .",
    "this is what we actually observe in figure  [ fig : scalexp ] ( see subpanel ) .",
    "the same scaling , however , is preserved for @xmath41 for _ supersonic _ magnetized turbulence , which indicate , that , unlike , velocities , @xmath41 exhibits universal intermittency .      magnetic field is known to induce anisotropies of compressible mhd turbulence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "anisotropy increasing with the decrease of scale was predicted for alfvnic motions by @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth gs95 , see also @xcite , @xcite ) and confirmed numerically for compressible mhd in @xcite",
    ".    for supersonic motions figure  [ fig : local_frame ] shows that the scalings for @xmath20 are much steeper in both directions than those predicted by gs95 model ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 directions , respectively ) .",
    "however , those slopes still give a close to gs95 anisotropy ( @xmath65 ) , which is indicative of the dominance of the alfvnic ( `` incompressible '' ) motions .",
    "note , that in figure  [ fig : local_frame ] the sfs are obtained in the system of reference of the _ local _ magnetic field , i.e. the field on the scales of the fluctuations under study .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 denote second order sfs parallel and perpendicular to local magnetic field , respectively .    for @xmath41",
    "the slopes are significantly smaller ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 directions , respectively ) .",
    "the sf in perpendicular direction scales more like incompressible motions , i.e. @xmath70 . the slope of @xmath71 for @xmath41 is smaller than the corresponding one for @xmath3 resulting in the reduced degree of anisotropy ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood in terms of dense clamps strongly distorting magnetic field as they move in respect to magnetized fluid .      our results for velocity show that our simulations of strongly magnetized turbulence provide @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "according to f96 model ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : relations ] ) this suggests the existence of a rising spectrum of density fluctuations within the hierarchy of density clumps .",
    "we try to make our study more related to _ observations _ which usually measure densities integrated along the line of sight , i.e. column densities , or alternatively study the hierarchy of observed clump masses ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : relations ] ) .",
    "f96 model assumes the existence of an infinitely extended hierarchy . in our computations",
    "the structures are generated by turbulence at scales less than the scale of the computational box . therefore f96 scaling relations ( in eq .",
    "[ eqn : relations ] ) should be modified as follows @xmath75    our procedure of obtaining the scaling relation from column density maps can is similar to that , e.g. in @xcite , with the difference that they dealt with 3d data , while we deal with 2d data .",
    "first , we seek for a local maximum of column density .",
    "then we calculate the average column density within concentric boxes with gradually increasing the size @xmath15 . in case of determining the relation for @xmath76 , instead of averaging we",
    "apply the integration over the boxes .",
    "naturally , the results should correspond to each other .    in figure",
    "[ fig : densmass ] we present an example of scaling relation for column density for three models of turbulence with @xmath77 0.7 , 2 , and 7 .",
    "one can note , that the relation becomes more steep with the sonic mach number within the intertial range .",
    "the fractal dimensions can be calculated from the relation @xmath78 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath79 is a slope estimated from the plot within the intertial range . for our models the fractal dimension ranges from @xmath80 for the highly supersonic models to @xmath81 for subsonic model .",
    "respectively , the compressibility coefficients for presented models @xmath82 for @xmath83 to @xmath84 for @xmath74 .",
    "the latter roughly consistent with @xmath8 obtained for the velocity sf measurement in  [ sec : spec_strfun ] .",
    "the differences are probably due to insufficient statistics of rather rare high peaks . in general , the filling factor of peak decreases with the height of the peak .",
    "what is the effect of magnetic field on the @xmath41-scaling ? the spectra , third and higher moments of correlations obtained for our superalfvnic simulations with @xmath85 happen to be very similar to the case of strongly magnetized turbulence .",
    "results in @xcite on the kolmogorov spectrum of @xmath41 obtained for pure hydro ( i.e. @xmath86 ) .",
    "our results indicate that , unlike velocity , @xmath41 is much less affected by magnetic field . naturally , in super - alfvnic turbulence the anisotropies induced by magnetic field",
    "are not observed at large scales within the intertial range ( cf .",
    "the last paragraph of  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "[ [ dependence - of - alpha - on - the - extend - of - inertial - range ] ] dependence of @xmath8 on the extend of inertial range + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if we combine several facts together , namely , ( a ) that @xmath8 is a function of mach number , ( b ) that the maximum of density correspond to the dissipation scale , e.g. shock thickness scale @xmath87 , ( c ) that the amplitude of density in peaks scales as the mean density times @xmath88 , we have to conclude that as the inertial range from the injection scale @xmath89 to @xmath87 increases , for a given mach number , @xmath8 should decrease .",
    "connecting these facts we get the following relations , @xmath90 , which gives the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath91 and @xmath32 , namely , @xmath92",
    ". an interesting consequence of this would be a prediction of kolmogorov scaling for supersonic _ velocities _ when the injection and dissipation ranges are infinitely separated .",
    "consequently , the steeper velocity spectra reported in @xcite can be interpreted as an indication of a limited inertial range .",

    "their nature is extremely puzzling if one thinks in terms of kolmogorov scalings for density fluctuations .",

    "however , just the difference in slope can not explain the really dramatic variations in column densities observed .",
    "the present paper provides a different outlook at the problem of sins .",
    "we see that , while low amplitude density fluctuations exhibit kolmogorov scaling @xcite , high peaks of density correspond to a rising spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "thus , observing supersonic turbulence at small scales , we shall most frequently observe small amplitude fluctuations corresponding to kolmogorov - like spectrum of density fluctuations . occasionally , but inevitably , one will encounter isolated high density peaks .",
