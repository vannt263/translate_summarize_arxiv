    "the loss of longitudinal information does not dramatically increase the statistical uncertainty : a mc study shows that the -based measurement of the form factors leads to a @xmath73 increase in uncertainty with respect to an ideal , @xmath14-based measurement .",

    "the two methods have a different sensitivity to systematic effects .",
    "for example , the @xmath70-method is much less sensitive to radiative corrections , and therefore is used for the   decay mode , while the @xmath71-method leads to better statistical precision , and is used for the  decay mode .",

    "[ fig : detector ] ) and associated event reconstruction techniques have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "an 800 gev / c proton beam striking a beo target is used to produce two almost parallel neutral beams . a large vacuum decay region surrounded by photon veto detectors extends from 110 m to 159 m from the primary target .",
    "following a thin vacuum window at the end of the vacuum region is a drift chamber spectrometer , equipped with an analysis magnet which imparts a 0.41 gev / c kick in the horizontal plane .",
    "farther downstream , there is a trigger hodoscope , a pure csi electromagnetic calorimeter , and a muon system consisting of two scintillator hodoscopes behind 4 m and 5 m of steel .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation is used to correct for the acceptance of the  decay modes .",
    "the mc includes three main steps : event generation , propagation of particles through the detector , and simulation of the detector performance . a thorough discussion of this simulation program is given in  @xcite , and more specifically for  decays in  @xcite .",
    "to include leading - order qed radiative corrections , we use the klor program  @xcite .    for this analysis , we use a low intensity data sample collected in 1997 , which is the same data sample used to measure @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "consequently , most of the data selection requirements are similar to those used in the ktev partial width ratio analysis .",
    "the reconstruction begins with the identification of two oppositely charged tracks coming from a single vertex , reconstructed between @xmath76 and @xmath77  m from the primary target . to pass the event selection ,",
    "one of the two tracks must be within @xmath78  cm of a cluster in the csi calorimeter ; the second track is not required to have a cluster match .",

    "the main difference in the selection of the decay   compared to the partial width ratio analysis is driven by the need to distinguish between the pion and muon tracks in order to reconstruct @xmath69 .",
    "since the calorimeter selection does not uniquely identify the pion and muon , we identify the muon by requiring the extrapolation of a track to be near fired horizontal and vertical counters in the muon system .",
    "the quality of this `` match '' is measured by a @xmath97 variable that accounts for momentum - dependent multiple scattering in the steel in front of the muon system .",
    "we reject events with two matched tracks to suppress muon misidentification from @xmath98 decays and from pion penetrations through the steel .",
    "the misidentification is suppressed further by requiring 0.5  m separation between the two tracks at the muon system ( compared to the @xmath99  m segmentation of the muon system counters ) .",
    "the efficiency of the matching requirement is increased by demanding that the muon track projection be at least @xmath100  m inside the muon system outer aperture . to reduce the fraction of muons ranging out in the steel",
    ", we also require that the muon track momentum be greater than @xmath101  gev .",
    "these selection criteria result in the unambiguous identification of the pion and muon in the decay , with a swap probability of less than @xmath102 .",
    "there are two categories of background in this analysis : misidentified kaon decays and scattering background caused by a kaon scattering off a beamline element ( absorber or collimator ) .",
    "the misidentification background for the  decay mode is below @xmath103 and is ignored .",
    "the background for the  decay mode is also small ( @xmath104 ) , but is not uniform in   and must be subtracted .",

    "systematic uncertainties arising from the modeling of the background are discussed in section  [ sec : bg ] .",
    "the main kinematic variables for the extraction of the semileptonic form factors are the transverse momenta - squared of all three particles , @xmath57 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , as well as the pion - lepton invariant mass , @xmath58 .",

    "next , we define the radiative correction @xmath135 for each bin as the ratio of the number of generated events for the nominal mc ( including radiative effects from klor ) to the number of generated events for a separate born - level mc ; these mc samples are normalized using the global radiative correction @xmath52 . after correcting for acceptance and radiative effects ,",
    "the number of corrected data events for a given @xmath69 bin is given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the number of reconstructed events .",
    "both acceptance and radiative corrections depend on the form factors and are therefore determined in an iterative procedure starting with the pdg values .",
