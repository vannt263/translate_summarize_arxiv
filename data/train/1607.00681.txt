    "finally , using standard continuity arguments and the improvement of the bootstrap bounds , we present the proof of theorem  [ t : main_global ] in section  [ s : finalproof ] .    to summarize , a novel aspect of our methodology is the introduction of the weight functions @xmath241 with very specific decay properties .",
    "one of its key features is that it measures the boundary energy contribution in terms of a higher - order sobolev norm weighted by an explicit exponential @xmath242 .",
    "this simplifies the global - in - time analysis with respect to  @xcite , and provides a tool for studying similar multi - phase problems in the absence of surface tension .",
