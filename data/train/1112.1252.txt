    "+ cold atmospheric plasma jets have been developed and studied in the past for many different applications , like thin film deposition @xcite , inactivation of pathogens @xcite or generation of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "many of the developed sources use helium as plasma forming gas @xcite with a small admixture of a molecular gas ( e.g. molecular oxygen ) .",
    "it has been shown that these jets are effective in producing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and can effectively inactivate for example bacteria or etch hydrocarbon polymer layers @xcite . + for the understanding of the interaction of the plasma effluent with substrates , of inactivation of bacteria , or of its effects on living tissues , it is necessary to know absolute densities and fluxes of reactive species in the plasma jet . moreover , the microplasma jets are in many cases operated in ambient atmosphere , which effect on the plasma effluent is not fully and quantitatively understood .",
    "+ measurements of absolute densities of reactive species in microplasma jets are a nontrivial task due to the high pressure and the small dimensions",
    ". advanced diagnostics like two - photon absorption laser - induced fluorescence spectroscopy ( talif ) @xcite , molecular beam mass spectrometry ( mbms ) @xcite or absorption spectroscopy @xcite have to be used to obtain absolute ros densities .",
    "it is important for possible applications that all measurements are carried in realistic situations .",
    "many experiments are , however , performed in a controlled atmosphere of noble gas , whereas possible applications will be performed in ambient air . + here , absolute atomic oxygen and ozone densities in the effluent of a he / o@xmath0 micro - scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jet ( @xmath2-appj ) operated in ambient helium and air are measured by absolutely calibrated mbms .",
    "the main focus of the work presented here is to analyze the influence of ambient air on the ros densities and to reveal possible reaction pathways leading to their production .",
    "this is achieved by a comparison of the experimental data to a fluid model of the gas flow combined with chemical reactions in the plasma effluent .",
    "only a brief description of the experimental setup is provided here since it has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that in this study the @xmath2-appj has been operated and analyzed in ambient air in contrast to previous measurements in an ambient helium atmosphere .",
    "a schematic sketch of the already defined @xmath2-appj is shown in figure [ fig : appj ] .",
    "the microplasma jet consists of two parallel stainless steel electrodes ( 30 mm long , 1 mm thick ) separated by a gap of 1 mm .",
    "one electrode is powered by an rf power supply ( 13.56mhz , absorbed power @xmath31w ) , while the other one is grounded .",

    "the plasma volume of 30x1x1mm@xmath4 is confined on both sides by glass plates .",
    "+ if not stated otherwise , the plasma is operated with a gas flow of 1.4slm he with 0.6% o@xmath0 and an applied electrode voltage of 230v@xmath5 . + previous measurements in a he atmosphere @xcite revealed that the @xmath2-appj is very effective in producing ros .",
    "an o@xmath0 dissociation rate up to 20% and maximum o and o@xmath1 densities around 10@xmath6@xmath7 could be measured .",
    "the o density is maximal at an o@xmath0 admixture of 0.6% , while the o@xmath1 density continuously increases with the o@xmath0 admixture .",
    "the atomic oxygen density increases when a higher power is applied to the @xmath2-appj , whereas the ozone density slightly decreases . with increasing distance from the @xmath2-appj nozzle ,",
    "the o concentration decreases and the o@xmath1 concentration increases .",
    "-appj , scaledwidth=70.0% ]      the so - called x - jet is a modified version of the @xmath2-appj and allows the separation of heavy species from photons in the effluent downstream of the plasma . the separation is realized in the crossed channel structure at the nozzle of the jet , where a direct channel ( extension of the space between electrodes ) is crossed by an additional side channel ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : x - jet ] ) . a helium flow introduced through the side channel of this structure deflects the particles in the plasma effluent ( incl . radicals and metastables ) from their movement through the direct channel into a side channel .",
    "the photons , on the contrary , are not affected by this additional gas flow and they can propagate undisturbed through the direct channel . a detailed description of the x - jet and tests of its performance can be found in the literature @xcite . as will be demonstrated later , the x - jet allows to test the photochemistry induced by plasma generated photons in the gas mixture introduced through the side channel ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : x - jet]a ) and in ambient air .",
    "a molecular beam mass spectrometer ( mbms ) is used to study the effluent of the @xmath2-appj . because the operation of a mass spectrometer ( ms ) requires a good vacuum",
    ", a differential pumping system has to be used .",
    "the system has been described in detail previously @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the mbms consists of three pumping stages that are connected by small orifices ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : mbms ] ) .",
    "the gas extraction from the atmosphere into the first pumping stage is done by a sampling orifice with a diameter of 100@xmath2 m . in the first stage , a special beam chopper ( i.e. rotating flat metal disk with four small embedded skimmers ) is mounted to allow only a pulsed gas flow into the differential pumping system .",
    "the second and third pumping stages are interconnected via a skimmer ( @xmath8 0.8 mm ) .",
    "the ionizer of the ms is installed in the third stage in line - of - sight with the orifice and the skimmer to ensure that the molecular beam ( mb ) forming behind the sampling orifice can reach the ionizer without any disturbances . +",
    "two different mbms designs have been used . on the one hand ,",
    "the previously described one @xcite with the front plate of the mbms oriented vertically like shown in figure [ fig : mbms ] and on the other hand a new mbms setup with slightly different dimension and a horizontally oriented front plate .",
    "the axis of the @xmath2-appj has always been placed normal to the sampling orifice pointing directly at it ( see figure [ fig : mbms ] ) .",
    "+ a chamber for a controlled atmosphere is mounted at the front plate of the mbms system and encloses the plasma jet . the volume of the chamber ( approx .",
    "1.1dm@xmath4 ) can be filled with helium or air .",
    "+ the ms measures the species density in the ionizer . with a proper background correction",
    ", the composition of the mb in the ionizer can be determined . when gas is sampled from atmosphere to low pressure ,",
    "the composition of the mb is , however , different from the original composition of the gas mixture at the sampling orifice .",
    "this is due to the so - called composition distortion in mbms sampling .",
    "a supersonic expansion takes place downstream from the sampling orifice and a supersonic free jet is formed @xcite .",
    "several different effects are responsible for the change in composition @xcite : radical recombination at external probe surface , acceleration into probe orifice , chemical relaxation in free jet , radial diffusion in free jet , skimmer interference and mach - number focusing . probably , one of the most important effects is radial diffusion in the supersonic free jet .",
    "huge radial pressure gradients exist just behind the sampling orifice which results into larger diffusion fluxes in the radial direction .",
    "the extent of this diffusion is different for different species , depending mainly on their mass , collision cross section and main collisional partner .",
    "hence , pressure diffusion leads to mass separation downstream from the orifice .",
    "it has been shown that heavy species tend to remain on the central streamline because their diffusion is slow , whereas light species diffuse faster outwards along the pressure gradients .",
    "this effect leads to discrimination of light species against heavy ones in the composition of the mb .",
    "+ the influence of composition distortion is difficult to determine theoretically because it consists of many different effects .",
    "however , we can demonstrate it experimentally and use the observed changes in the signal to compensate for the composition distortion .",
    "+ the composition distortion is demonstrated by measuring the ms signals of a small amount of ne ( 1% ) or n@xmath0o ( 0.5% ) in a he / air gas mixture .",
    "the air concentration in he / air mixture has been varied between pure he ( light atoms with small collision cross section as main collision partners ) and pure air ( heavy diatomic molecules with larger collision cross section ) , whereas the ne and n@xmath0o concentrations were kept constant .",
    "ne is in pure he the heavier species and will enrich on the center line of the mb .",
    "while changing the he / air ratio towards pure air , ne becomes the lighter species compared to the mean molecular mass of the mixture and will consequently diffuse faster out of the mb .",
    "figure [ fig : nen2o ] shows the relative ne signal measured by the mbms as function of the air content in the he / air mixture .",
    "the ne signal decreases by a factor of 4 during the he / air ratio variation .",
    "the n@xmath0o signal exhibits surprisingly a very similar behavior , even if it is more than twice heavier than ne and heavier as n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 molecules in air .",
    "the difference between the masses of ne , n@xmath0o and air ( n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 ) is probably not significant and the effect is dominated by their difference to he .",
    "o signal of different he / air mixtures with constant addition of ne ( 1% ) and n@xmath0o ( 0.5%),scaledwidth=50.0% ]     + the measurements in the figure [ fig : nen2o ] show clearly that the composition distortion has to be taken into account .",
    "the amount of air in the effluent and the effect of composition distortion will strongly depend on the distance from the jet nozzle .",
    "the following procedure is adopted to take this effect into account in the signal calibration .",
    "first , the amount of air in the effluent at a given distance from the jet is determined by measuring the he and n@xmath0/o@xmath0 signals .",
    "these signals are compared to the measurements obtained with he / air mixtures with well defined composition .",
    "the local air content in the effluent can be determined in this way .",
    "this air content , together with the data in the figure [ fig : nen2o ] , is used to determine the correction factors necessary to compensate for the difference in the composition distortion in pure he and in he / air mixtures .",
    "the o and o@xmath1 signals are hence scaled up to the values , which would be obtained in pure he .",
    "the additional calibration is performed as described previously for the measurements in pure he @xcite .",
    "just briefly , o and o@xmath1 is calibrated by comparing their signals measured at masses 16 and 44 to signals measured for known densities of ne and n@xmath0o in he , respectively .",
    "these gases have been chosen because of their similar mass and structure in comparison to o and o@xmath1 .",
    "the electron impact ionization cross sections and the known mass dependence of the transmission function of the ms for different species are taken into account as well .",
    "atomic oxygen has been measured with an electron energy in the ionizer of about 15ev to prevent dissociative ionization of molecular oxygen .",
    "ozone has been measured with an electron energy of 70ev because the signal does not overlap with dissociative ionization of other species .",
    "absolute atomic oxygen and ozone densities in the effluent of the @xmath2-appj obtained by mbms can be used to reveal possible reaction pathways leading to their formation .",
    "the densities of ros in the effluent of similar plasmas have already been measured and the chemical kinetics of these species have been modeled in the past @xcite . + the reaction pathways proposed in these works are used here as a starting reaction scheme used in a 2d axially symmetric fluid model of our @xmath2-appj . the model is based on the model already described in our previous work @xcite , however , the effect of ambient air is added now and the measured absolute densities of o and o@xmath1 are used to validate the model results . the 2d axially symmetric geometry is used to be able to model the diffusion of air into the gas stream emanating from the plasma jet and to take the diffusion of ros into account .",
    "the fluid model combines the solution of the navier - stokes equations for the gas flow in the gas mixture of he and air with the model of chemical kinetics of ros .",
    "the model is solved using commercial comsol 3.5 software .",
    "the gas flow through the jet and in the effluent is solved first .",
    "only he and air ( represented by n@xmath0 , see later ) are considered in the model of the gas flow , because the concentration of o@xmath0 , which is injected into the plasma , and all other plasma products is less than 1% and can be neglected .",

    "this means that more ozone is produced due to admixture of air into the effluent than due to atomic oxygen emanating from the plasma . however , there is no reaction in the proposed scheme of jeong _ et al .",
    "_ , which could explain the additional production of ozone .",
    "this can be clearly seen , when the measured densities are compared to the results of model 1 , also plotted in figure [ fig : air ] .",
    "+ the model 1 predicts a faster decrease of the atomic oxygen density due to a faster reaction rate of reactions r@xmath59 , r@xmath0 , r@xmath1 , r@xmath61 , and r@xmath62 .",
    "this is caused by more available o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 in the effluent because of the air diffusion into it .",
    "correspondingly , ozone is produced faster compare to the case in ambient he .",
    "however , its maximal density predicted by model 1 is still limited by the limited amount of oxygen atoms from the plasma and can not exceed the limit given by the sum of initial o and o@xmath1 densities .",
    "both o and o@xmath1 densities simulated by model 1 do not reproduced the measured data ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : air ] ) .",
    "the atomic oxygen density does not decrease as fast as expected by the model , but stays relatively high even at a larger distance from the jet and , as already mentioned , much more ozone is produced .",
    "these results indicate that some reactions , which generate additional o atoms and o@xmath1 molecules , are missing in the simulation model 1 .",
    "+ the additional production of o atoms has already been observed by other authors .",
    "@xcite have observed that o atoms could be detected by talif even at the distance of 10 cm from a similar , but larger , planar jet operated in he with 0.5% o@xmath0 gas mixture and in he as ambient atmosphere .",
    "they concluded that electrons and ions as well as metastable helium atoms can be excluded as an origin for an energy transport into the effluent because their respective densities quickly decrease , as soon as electric excitation ceases .",
    "additionally , they have detected energetic vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) radiation by oes and have shown that ( v)uv radiation originating from the discharge region reaches far into the effluent .",
    "therefore , they have concluded that `` ( v)uv radiation produces atomic oxygen in the effluent by dissociation of ozone or molecular oxygen .",
    "'' @xcite this conclusion has been corroborated in their following work , where the plasma emitted photons have been blocked , which resulted in a decrease of o densities in the effluent @xcite .",
    "( v)uv radiation as a source of reactive species in the effluent of the @xmath2-appj has also been observed indirectly during the inactivation of bacteria by the effluent of the x - jet @xcite .",
    "we will try now , with the help of the absolute calibrated data , additional mbms measurements , and adjustment of the fluid model , to reveal more details about a possible o and o@xmath1 generation scheme in the plasma effluent .",
    "_ the possible effect of air back diffusion _ + as already discussed , the results in the literature indicate that plasma generated ( v)uv photons can initiate photodissociation reactions leading to formation of additional o and subsequently o@xmath1 .",
    "before we , however , discuss the possible photodissociation reactions , we need to check for the possible effect of air back diffusion into the plasma channel .",
    "the gas flow simulation has shown , that air back diffusion is almost negligible .",
    "but the model represents an ideal case without effects due to actual design and realization of the plasma jet such as diffusion along the corner edge of the square geometry .",
    "additionally , the simulation shows that even in the ideal case the air can come into direct contact with the active plasma zone .",
    "point a in figure [ fig : geometry ] marks the edge of the plasma channel , where it takes place .",
    "the electron driven dissociation of atmospheric o@xmath0 followed by the diffusion of the products towards the jet axis could also be a source of additional o and o@xmath1 . to exclude this effect ,",
    "we have built a modified @xmath2-appj with an elongated gas channel .",
    "this gas channel is made from glass plates , starts directly at the electrodes , has a length of 3 mm and a 1@xmath341mm@xmath25 cross section .",
    "the plasma effluent is therefore confined the first 3 mm after the plasma region and a direct interaction between atmospheric air and the plasma is prevented .",
    "figure [ fig : extendedappj ] shows the comparison of the ozone signals obtained with the standard @xmath2-appj without extension and the extended @xmath2-appj .",
    "only relative data are shown , no absolute calibration and compensation for the changing composition distortion have been performed .",
    "no significant difference can be found between both measurements .",
    "one can , therefore , conclude that diffusion of air into the plasma can not explain the increased ozone ( and also o ) production .",
    "+ during these measurements , the newer mbms setup with horizontally oriented front plate has been used .",
    "therefore , the influence of the helium buoyancy is different and the shape of the measured ozone signal differs a little bit from the previous measurement ( cf .",

    "this estimated production rate can be used further to estimated the necessary photon flux , if the photodissociation is the main source of this ozone .",
    "the o@xmath1 density rises from 0.5@xmath63 to 3.0@xmath64 on the distance of 13 mm ( starting at 6 mm from the jet nozzle ) .",
    "the fluid model predicts the average gas velocity on the axis of about 25 m/s resulting in the transport time t=0.013/25s = 0.52ms .",
    "the averaged ozone production rate in the effluent can therefore be estimated as : @xmath65 the right hand side of equation [ ozone_rate ] is the estimated production rate of the ozone due to photodissociation of some source molecule ( e.g. o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 ) with density @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 is the photodissociation cross section , @xmath68 is the photon flux from plasma per unit area and second , and factor 2 takes into account that two o@xmath1 molecules can be produced in each case .",

    "the two o atoms will as in the previous case react to o@xmath1 providing again a net production of two new o@xmath1 molecules .",
    "+ the typical maximum of the photodissociation cross sections of o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 molecules ( @xmath69 ) @xcite , can be used to estimate the lowest necessary photon flux in the ideal case , in which each photon is absorbed with maximum probability . with n@xmath70 and",
    "n@xmath71 the photon fluxes of at least @xmath72 and @xmath73 are necessary for the ozone production via photodissociation of o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 , respectively . with the 1 mm@xmath25 cross - section area of the jet and a chosen photon energy of 5ev",
    ", we obtain a necessary energy flux of at least 2mw in the case of dissociation of o@xmath0 and 1w in the case of photodissociation of o@xmath1 .",
    "the latter reaction can be directly excluded , because the power absorbed by the plasma is for sure lower than 1w and the plasma can not generate so many photons . even in the case of photodissociation of o@xmath0 seems the power of the photon flux too high , considering the crude simplifications in the estimation of the photon flux .",
    "however , it could still contribute to the production of o and ozone in the effluent .",
    "+ luckily , the photodissociation reaction of o@xmath0 by plasma generated photons can directly be tested by the x - jet modification of the @xmath2-appj . for this experiment",
    "the additional he flow with different concentrations of o@xmath0 is flown through the side channel of the x - jet , whereas the plasma is ignited in the standard mixture of he with 0.6% of o@xmath0 in the direct channel between electrodes .",
    "the additional flow diverts the plasma effluent from the direct channel into the side channel after the crossing of both channels and fills at the same time the part of the direct channel after the crossing with a he / o@xmath0 gas mixture as shown in the figure [ fig : x - jet]a .",
    "the plasma generated photons , which are propagating through the direct channel of the x - jet , overlap spatially with the he / o@xmath0 gas .",
    "the possible flow of o and o@xmath1 from the direct channel , generated now by photodissociation reactions , can be measured by the mbms system .",
    "o@xmath0 concentrations of up to 20% and different distances between the nozzle of the direct channel and the sampling orifice of the mbms were tested to allow the photons traveling different lengths through the he / o@xmath0 mixture and also to allow air to diffuse into the gas flow .",
    "ozone has never been detected in these measurements .",
    "additionally , the normal @xmath2-appj operated in pure he gas , without addition of o@xmath0 gas , has been operated in ambient atmosphere and the production of ozone in the effluent at different distances from the jet has been measured .",
    "even more vuv radiation is expected to be produced in this case due to slower quenching of excited states and higher densities of helium excimers .",
    "the ozone density was also in this case below the detection limit of the ms .",
    "all these measurements are evidence that photodissociation of ground state o@xmath0 molecules can be very probably excluded as the source of additional o and o@xmath1 in the effluent .",
    "it seems , that photodissociation reactions are not the source of additional o atoms and ozone molecules under our experimental conditions and some other oxygen containing species generated in the plasma have to be involved in this process .",
    "+ summarizing the facts discussed up to now , the following conditions have to be fulfilled in the involved reaction mechanism : ( i ) the vuv radiation can be probably excluded as a source of additional o and o@xmath1 due to the above discussed reasons ; ( ii ) molecular ground state oxygen from air is required because the additional ozone signal only appears when air diffuses into the effluent ; ( iii ) atomic oxygen is produced in this reaction because the o densities are at larger distances from the jet higher as predicted by model 1 ( cf .",
    "figure[fig : air ] ) ; ( iv ) some reactive oxygen species from the plasma have to be involved in the reaction because the interaction of the effluent of pure he plasma with ambient air does not lead to formation of o and o@xmath1 ; and ( v ) the reaction has to be somehow limited by the o@xmath0 density because the effect is weak with 0.6% of o@xmath0 in the mixture ( the measurements with he as ambient atmosphere ) but becomes significant at higher o@xmath0 densities when air admixes into the effluent . + the reaction of the highly vibrationally excited o@xmath0(_v _ ) molecules , which are generated in the plasma and have a limited life time , with the ground state o@xmath0",
    "is proposed here as a possible reaction mechanism .",
    "the vibrationally excited oxygen molecules can directly react with ground state oxygen molecules ( reaction r@xmath74 ) producing an oxygen atom and an ozone molecule .",
    "two o@xmath1 are therefore effectively formed per reaction .",
    "the reactions of highly excited o@xmath0(__v__@xmath7526 ) molecules have been for example discussed in the literature and were proposed to solve the ozone deficit problem in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "additionally , the o@xmath0(_v _ ) relax decay to its ground state ( reaction r@xmath48 ) is proposed to explain the small effect observed in the experiments in ambient he .",
    "this reaction scheme has been included to the simulation ( model 2 ) .",
    "since some of the needed parameters are unknown , they have been adjusted until model 2 fits reasonably well the measured densities .",

    "if they exist , should be performed before accepting this reaction mechanism .",
    "additionally , it should be checked whether this proposed reaction mechanism can explain the observations , which have lead to the conclusion that vuv and uv photons are involved in the effluent chemistry .",
