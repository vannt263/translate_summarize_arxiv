    "granular media are large conglomerations of discrete , solid particles , such as sand , gravel , or powder , with unusual , interesting dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional system of spherical beads in a lattice is one of the simplest representation of granular media substrates , wherein each bead represents a grain of material . in this approximation ,",
    "the position of a particular bead is based on forces resulting from its interaction with its two nearest neighbors  @xcite .",
    "this context has proved especially fruitful for investigating numerous aspects of the nonlinear dynamic response of such bead chain systems  @xcite .",
    "a particular focal point of emphasis has been on the study of one - dimensional granular crystals .",
    "the availability of a wide variety of materials and bead sizes , as well as the tunability of the response within the weakly or strongly nonlinear regime renders such crystals an ideal playground for the investigation of a variety of fundamental concepts ranging from nonlinear waves and discrete breathers to shock waves , defect modes and bifurcation phenomena among many others .",
    "however , this tunability also makes these crystals promising candidates for a wide variety of engineering applications such as shock and energy absorbing materials  @xcite , actuating and focusing devices  @xcite , and sound scramblers or filters  @xcite .",
    "one aspect that has not been studied , to the best of our knowledge , in such prototypical granular lattices is that of directed transport via the so - called ratcheting effect . directed ratchet transport ( drt ) , is defined as the directed transmission of an entity despite the lack of a net external force acting upon it  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been associated with applications in dc current in semiconductors  @xcite , the motion of fluxons in josephson junctions  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , among many others .",
    "furthermore , drt occurring in granular systems has been associated with the study of molecular motors  @xcite . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the emergence of drt behavior is associated with the breaking of symmetries , which can be achieved by either a reshaping of the system s potential or by introducing an external forcing  @xcite . for instance , drt is present when a granular material is placed in a vertically vibrating sawtooth surface profile  @xcite .",
    "typically , drt is studied ( for a single particle or a collection of particles ) when the external input acts on the system as a whole  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work , on the other hand , is to force a _",
    "single _ particle to achieve global drt in the context of granular crystals .    in what follows in section",
    "ii , we present the basic ( fermi - pasta - ulam type ) model that is widely accepted as representing the one - dimensional dynamics of a granular crystal  @xcite with parameters that are adapted from recent experiments on the field such as refs .  @xcite .",
    "we then proceed to use the tunability of the system through actuating one bead within the chain by means of suitable biharmonic forcing that will be the source of our drt through its induced breaking of time - reversal and half - period time shift symmetries .",
    "in particular , in section iii , we will propose a biharmonic forcing of the system involving the simplest pair of two frequencies @xmath0 relevant for such drt ( i.e. , with @xmath1 coprimes and @xmath2 odd ) , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite . in section iv",
    ", we will develop diagnostic quantities evaluating the relative magnitude of the clearly discernible in our numerical computations drt .",
    "we will analyze the dependence of the induced asymmetry in the crystal response on both the frequency of the drive @xmath5 , as well as on the relative strength of the two terms in the biharmonic forcing , as controlled by the corresponding parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the former analysis will separate different regimes in our observation of drt , namely the non - permanent deformation of the crystal that we will refer to as temporal ratcheting and the permanent deformation thereof that we will refer to as spatial ratcheting .",
    "the clear distinction between these two regimes is an especially intriguing feature of our current setup .",
    "the latter analysis ( over @xmath6 ) will provide a means for optimizing the ensuing transport which can both be theoretically understood and , in principle , experimentally exploited .",
    "finally , we consider in section v , the modification of the above features in the more experimentally realistic setup incorporating dissipation .",
    "we find there that the relevant phenomenology is modified dramatically , including even a potential reversal of the direction of the current ( for sufficiently low driving frequencies ) .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our findings and present a number of directions for future study .",
    "to ensure that the beads remain in contact , we consider a horizontal lattice that is precompressed on both ends with a force @xmath7 resulting in a static bead displacement @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beadlattice ] ) .",
    "the existence of the precompression also serves to ensure that a linear spectrum of excitations exists in the lattice ( see details below ) . with these considerations , based on the hertzian law of spherical",
    "point contacts , a system comprised of @xmath9 identical beads can be described by the following newtonian equation  @xcite : @xmath10_+^\\frac{3}{2 } - a[\\delta_0+u_{i}-u_{i+1}]_+^\\frac{3}{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11_+ = { \\rm max}\\left\\{0,y\\right\\}$ ] , @xmath12 is the bead mass , @xmath13 is the displacement of the center of the @xmath14th bead from its equilibrium position , and @xmath15 is the hertzian constant calculated as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are , respectively , the bead s radius , young s elastic modulus , and poisson s ratio .",
    "the static displacement is @xmath20 . in line with the experiments of refs .",

    ".default parameters for bead - lattice system .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we will show later , a critical factor affecting the presence / type of drt is the acoustic phonon band cutoff frequency .",
    "plane wave solutions to the system follow the dispersion relation @xmath21  @xcite , where @xmath22 is the wave number and @xmath23 is the temporal frequency . we see that this relationship is periodic ( with period @xmath24 ) and that there is a cutoff frequency @xmath25 , above which plane wave solutions can not propagate .",
    "the maximal frequency value occurs at the boundaries of the @xmath26 interval , which correspond to the smallest allowable wavelength .",
    "substituting @xmath27 into the dispersion relation yields the cutoff frequency , @xmath28 therefore , @xmath29 defines the range of propagating frequencies , called the acoustic band .",

    "typically , drt behavior is observed in the velocity of a single particle or in that of a coherent structure such as a solitary wave  @xcite . in the case of the granular crystal",
    "though , drt will be observed ( and examined ) throughout the system as a whole .",

    "the motivation for choosing to control the displacement of the central bead is that we envisage the possibility of doing experimental drt studies in the future where the position of the central bead will be controlled by an actuator .",
    "an essential characteristic of this functional form is that it has a zero - integral over one period , indicating that the function is not biased in any direction . in other words , the @xmath34th bead",
    "s temporal center of mass , relative its equilibrium position , is zero .",
    "consequently , any directed behavior observed must be attributed to drt rather than a preferential direction for the input .",
    "it is relevant to note that the prescription of the motion of the @xmath34th bead is tantamount to introducing a force , with the same characteristics , into its nearest neighbors through the equations of motion ( [ eomcomp ] ) .    for @xmath39 each bead orbit on one side of",
    "the lattice corresponds directly to an orbit on the other side of the lattice traveling in the opposite direction , translated by a half - period delay .",
    "these orbits exactly cancel each other out and thus there is no drt . however , when @xmath40 , the symmetry of @xmath41 is broken and drt can occur @xcite .",
    "the system is numerically solved using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "the conservation of total energy is used to determine an appropriate time step .",
    "the final integration time @xmath42 varies based on the frequency @xmath5 , but is always selected so that it is an integer multiple of @xmath43 , the period of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath9 also varies with @xmath5 , but is always sufficiently large so that energy from @xmath34th bead s oscillation never reaches the 1st or @xmath9th bead .",
    "we consider values of @xmath5 ranging from 10 to 40 and set @xmath6 equal to @xmath44 . in section",
    "[ sec : ip&r ] , we demonstrate that these parameters result in drt towards the right - hand side of the lattice . it is possible to change this direction by adding an additional phase mismatch between the two harmonics of the driver @xmath41 ( results not shown here ) . figure  [ fig : varyamp ] illustrates drt magnitude ( quantification is discussed in section  [ sec : ip&r ] ) for values of @xmath37 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "these relatively small values of the forcing amplitude @xmath37 ensure that a ( relatively ) small amount of energy is introduced into the system so the beads always remain in contact with each other .",
    "the relationship between @xmath37 and the drt magnitude is clearly nonlinear , as the average slope of the lines in the log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyamp ] is about 2.9725 , which indicates an essentially cubic ( gain ) relationship . based on these findings",
    ", the remaining simulations have @xmath47 in order to exploit most of the nonlinear gain but also avoid losing contact between all beads for all times .",
    "in order to quantify the drt displayed by the bead chain , let us define the quantity @xmath48 corresponding to the average of the hertzian forces on either side of the @xmath14th bead integrated over time .",
    "this choice of drt measure is inspired by the fact that a piezo embedded inside a bead precisely measures the average of the hertzian forces felt by the adjacent beads .",
    "it is important to mention at this stage that drt could be captured using many possible measures .",
    "in fact , we also used , instead of @xmath48 , the actual forces acting on each bead and other combinations thereof and the results are qualitatively similar ( results not shown here ) .",
    "we should point out that it is essential to consider the entire space of possible phases @xmath38 in @xmath41 .",
    "this allows the full spectrum of the function to be sampled without biasing any direction based on the initial phase of the driver . to do this in our numerical experiments , we consider sixteen values of @xmath38 , equally spaced throughout one period of @xmath41 and define @xmath49 as the average of @xmath48 over these phases",

    "we have @xmath63 since the energy from the forcing function has not yet reached beads offset this far from the center bead .",

    "is associated not with the translation of the structure over the lattice which roughly preserves its shape , as in class iiia .",

    ", we now establish an additional ratcheting metric .",
    "for each of the drt profiles under consideration , @xmath74 represents the maximal amount of temporal ratcheting at any given time .",
    "we use this value as the temporal drt metric . on the other hand , when spatial ratcheting is present , it is first observed by comparing beads adjacent to the @xmath34th bead , that is at @xmath75 . as time progresses , the behavior spreads out from the center bead and is also observed for larger values of @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that @xmath52 is approximately the same for each @xmath54 exhibiting spatial drt behavior ; therefore the magnitude of spatial ratcheting can be quantified by means of @xmath76 .",
    "both @xmath74 and @xmath76 vary slightly over time .",
    "nevertheless , we have verified that this variation is small and , therefore , choose to measure @xmath76 and @xmath74 at the final integration time @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq - drt ] illustrates the magnitude of spatial and temporal drt , based on the above diagnostic , for a wide range of representative frequencies . for class",
    "i ( @xmath78 ) , the magnitude of temporal drt slowly increases with the frequency .",
    "this regime corresponds to both input frequencies of the forcing ( @xmath5 and @xmath56 ) being below the cutoff frequency @xmath79 . as it can be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - drt ] , the spatial drt starts appearing once the second harmonic ( @xmath56 ) of the driver gets closer to the cutoff frequency ( see left vertical dashed line ) .",
    "this seems to be an effect of the nonlinear response of the system that `` widens '' the region of the cutoff frequency .",
    "in fact , class ii corresponds to the region of frequencies where the second harmonic of the driver transitions from being transmitted to completely being stopped due to the cutoff frequency .",
    "it is interesting that for class ii and iiia , defined by @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath69 but @xmath56 close to ( under or over ) @xmath57 , the temporal drt magnitude is approximately constant .",
    "however , as the first harmonic ( @xmath5 ) starts getting close to the cutoff frequency ( see right vertical dashed line ) , naturally , both spatial and temporal drt start to disappear and eventually vanish , as expected , once both , first and second , driver harmonics are inside the forbidden gap .",
    "the effect of the first harmonic starting to approach the cutoff frequency begins at , approximately , @xmath81 , corresponding to the onset of class iiib behavior , the magnitude of temporal drt begins to sharply decrease as @xmath5 approaches @xmath57 .",
    "this lack of drt for higher frequencies is consistent with the drt breaking down for @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , spatial drt significantly increases as we move from class i to class ii and subsequently iiia , and it also , in turn , sharply decreases in the case of class iiib .",
    "we define the _ outer - cone horizon _ as the location of the onset of temporal drt and the _ inner - cone horizon _ as the location of the onset of spatial drt .",
    "the velocities of the outer and inner horizon are calculated numerically for values of @xmath5 ranging from 10 to 40 . for each frequency",
    ", the velocity of the outer - cone horizon approximately corresponds to the sound velocity of the system , @xmath82 ( see filled dots in fig .  [",
    "fig : freq - vel ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the nonlinearity of the system that `` mixes '' the frequencies introduced by the forcing and thus excites all modes .",
    "in contrast to the behavior observed by the outer - cone velocity , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : freq - vel ] ( see open dots ) , the inner - cone velocity strongly depends on the forcing frequency . for small values of @xmath5 , where both @xmath5 and @xmath56 are smaller than @xmath57 , there is essentially no spatial drt , as the two cones propagate with essentially the same speed forming the `` pulse '' observed in the asymmetry indicator @xmath52 .",
    "as the frequency increases through class i and toward class ii , the velocity of the inner - cone horizon decreases significantly until the threshold @xmath70 is crossed . at that point",
    "the inner - cone velocity approaches zero . within class ii , the continuously decreasing velocity of the inner - cone forms the tail of the kink discussed in connection to fig .",
    "[ fig : impprof ] . past the point of @xmath83 ,",
    "the inner - cone velocity abruptly increases to a value similar to that for the lower frequencies .",
    "subsequently , in class iiia , the velocity decreases as the case where both @xmath5 and @xmath56 are larger than @xmath57 is approached .",
    "class iiib corresponds to a larger rate of decreasing velocity .",
    "interestingly , the spatio - temporal wave velocities are independent of the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to point out at this stage that the presence of drt in our system is a direct consequence of the symmetry breaking provided by the external forcing when @xmath84 [ see eq .",
    "( [ biharmonic2 ] ) ] .",
    "however , it is also important to note that nonlinearity is also a key ingredient for the presence of drt .",
    "in fact , if the hertzian forces in eq .",
    "( [ eomcomp ] ) are replaced by linear ( hooke ) springs , drt is no longer present .",
    "the absence of drt for the linear force case is a consequence of the fact that the drt corresponding to a phase @xmath38 is the negative of the one for phase @xmath85 , where @xmath43 is the period of the driver , and thus providing a cancellation when drt is averaged through all possible phases of the driver . finally , it is also important to stress that , as discussed earlier and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyamp ] , the magnitude of drt is , approximately , proportional to the cube of the forcing amplitude .",
    "therefore , nonlinearity in the system is not only necessary for observing drt , but it also provides a nonlinear enhancement of the drt magnitude with respect to the input amplitude .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that when considering the forcing function @xmath41 , the magnitude of drt behavior is due to two competing effects : the increase in the degree of symmetry breaking and the decrease in the transmitted impulse over a half - period , which is denoted as effective symmetry breaking .",
    "it was shown that the drt behavior is optimally enhanced for @xmath87 .",
    "we now demonstrate that this result holds for the granular crystal case under consideration .",

    "figure  [ fig : eta - drt ] illustrates the spatio - temporal drt magnitude as a function of @xmath6 . as is expected , for @xmath88 , the single harmonic does not induce drt behavior . as @xmath6 increases , the magnitude of drt increases until a maximum value for ratcheting is reached at @xmath89 ( in our case since drt is towards the left , the maximum ratcheting effect corresponds to a minimum for drt ) , with the exception of spatial drt for @xmath5 = 17.5 .",
    "the magnitude then decreases until drt is again not present at @xmath90 . to further explore and quantitatively appreciate this result ,",

    "the frequency , @xmath5 , and biharmonic weight , @xmath6 of the forcing function were varied so that the response of the magnitude of drt and the velocity of the drt  waves \" could be determined .",
    "while the wave velocity was independent of the biharmonic weight , @xmath87 maximized the magnitude of spatio - temporal drt , in accordance with the expectations of refs .",
    "friction was subsequently introduced into the system , leading to weakening of the ratcheting effect and a rather uniform spatial form of its profile in classes ii and iii .",
    "yet , it was class i that was most significantly affected by the inclusion of friction within the system , which resulted in drt switching directionality from right to left .    having paved the way for the consideration of ratchet effects in granular crystals , there are numerous directions along which the present study can be extended .",
    "it is certainly of interest to attempt to expand the range of considered materials and parameters ( as well as that of heterogeneous systems such as dimers , trimers  @xcite ) and of a wider range of forcing frequencies and displacement parameters .",
    "a key aspect of such a broader parametric effort is to try to maximize the relevant drt , so as to render it more accessible to potential experiments .",
    "another important direction of particular interest is to attempt to expand the present considerations to the realm of higher dimensional granular crystals .",
    "recent efforts have made these gradually more accessible to experimental investigations  @xcite and hence such ratcheting efforts would be extremely timely and relevant to consider .",

    "<S> we consider a system where the trajectory of the central bead is prescribed by a biharmonic forcing function with broken time - reversal symmetry . by comparing the mean integrated force of beads equidistant from the forcing bead , two distinct types of directed transport can be observed _spatial _ and _ temporal _ drt . based on the value of the frequency of the forcing function relative to the cutoff frequency , </S>",
    "<S> the system can be categorized by the presence and magnitude of each type of drt . </S>",
