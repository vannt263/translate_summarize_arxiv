    "this cutoff represents the energy where emission of graviton modes from the brane into the extra dimensions are damped by the effects of a non - rigid brane , and it is expected to be of order @xmath44 .    in this work we will use a gaussian cutoff  @xcite , which emerges if one includes in the interaction the brane goldstone modes . with this cutoff , a form factor @xmath45",

    "we describe a more universal and model - independent prediction of low - scale gravity scenarios : the production in particle collisions of microscopic bhs .      it has been argued  @xcite that bh formation should occur in the scattering of two incident particles when their impact parameter is approximately less than the schwarzschild radius of a bh of mass equal to their center - of - mass energy @xmath70 .",
    "this suggests a geometric cross section @xmath71 where @xmath72^{\\frac{1}{1+n } } \\left [ \\frac{2^n \\pi^{(n-3)/2}\\gamma({n+3\\over 2})}{n+2 } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+n}}\\ ] ] is the radius of a schwarzschild bh of mass @xmath73  @xcite in @xmath74 dimensions .",
    "even if the incident particles are stuck on the sm brane , the black hole formed should be treated as a fully @xmath74 dimensional object in an asymptotically minkowskian spacetime , as long as @xmath75 is small compared to @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite , in contrast to the sm process , bh production is not suppressed by perturbative couplings and is enhanced by the sum over all partons , particularly the gluon . as a result of these effects , bh production may exceed deep inelastic scattering rates in the sm by two or more orders of magnitude .",
    "although greatly reduced by the cross section for bh production , neutrino interaction lengths @xmath99 are still far larger than the earth s atmospheric depth , which is only @xmath100 even when traversed horizontally .",
    "neutrinos therefore produce bhs uniformly at all atmospheric depths . as a result , the most promising signal of bh creation by cosmic rays will be quasi - horizontal showers initiated by neutrinos deep in the atmosphere . for showers with large enough zenith angles ,",
    "the likelihood of interaction is maximized and the background from hadronic cosmic rays is eliminated , since these shower high in the atmosphere .",

    "these decays are predicted to lead to highly distinctive signals in collider events  @xcite , with high multiplicity , large transverse energy , hard leptons and jets , and a characteristic ratio of hadronic to leptonic activity .",
    "the magnitude of the entropy determines the validity of this picture .",
    "thermal fluctuations due to particle emission are small when @xmath108  @xcite , and statistical fluctuations in the microcanonical ensemble are small for @xmath109 @xcite . for @xmath110 ,",
    "( [ entropy ] ) gives @xmath111 ranging from 29 for @xmath69 to 25 for @xmath112 . for @xmath113 ( or 1 )",
    ", @xmath111 is about 13 ( or 3 ) for @xmath9 between 4 and 7 .    in searches for",
    "bh mediated events at colliders , it is essential to set @xmath94 high enough that the decay branching ratios predicted by the semiclassical picture of bh evaporation are reliable , as there are very large qcd backgrounds , and the extraction of signal from background relies on knowing the bh decay branching ratios reliably .",
    "this is especially true if one is attempting to determine discovery limits , where the overall rates for bh production are not necessarily large .",
    "thus , in collider searches , a cutoff of @xmath114 or more may be appropriate .",
    "by contrast , the search for deeply penetrating quasi - horizontal showers initiated by bh decays can afford to be much less concerned with the details of the final state , since the background is , relative to colliders , almost nonexistent . as a result",
    ", the signal relies only on the existence of visible decay products , which , in this context , includes all particles other than neutrinos , muons , and gravitons .",
    "indeed , there is very little about the final state , other than its total energy and to some degree its multiplicity and electromagnetic component  @xcite , that we can reasonably expect to observe , since detailed reconstruction of prompt decay particles is not possible at cosmic ray detectors .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to choose a significantly lower value of @xmath91 than is needed for collider searches ; in our estimates of rates below we will take @xmath94 as low as 1 . while bhs of mass around @xmath21 will be outside the semiclassical regime , it seems quite reasonable to expect that they , or their stringy progenitors , will nevertheless decay visibly , whatever stringy or quantum gravitational description applies .    as an illustration",

    "we adopt a minimum energy @xmath129 ( for @xmath130 so that while there are probably stringy corrections , the cross section should be substantially geometric .",
    "although the details of the process by which bhs decay are not of great concern to us , the production process is of central importance , since our rates ( and the lower limits we will be able to set on @xmath21 ) will depend directly on the form of the cross section .",
    "it should be emphasized that the heuristic arguments on which eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is based only determine @xmath119 up to an overall factor of order one . even at the classical level , our conclusions could be significantly affected by theoretical uncertainties in this factor , four sources of which we now discuss .",
    "classical general relativity calculations  @xcite indicate that the mass of a bh formed in a head - on collision is somewhat less ( about 16% less ) than the total center - of - mass energy .",
    "at least in four dimensions , this suggests that the formula eq .",

    ", corresponding calculations in more than four dimensions have been presented  @xcite .",
    "the analytic techniques used to study head - on collisions are not applicable to collisions at nonzero impact parameter . thus the claim that a bh will be produced when @xmath133 can only be expected to be true up to a numerical factor .",
    "one issue that arises at nonzero impact parameter that we can address is that the bhs formed will have angular momentum  @xcite . in particular , the schwarzschild radius appearing in the formula eq .",
    "( [ schwarz ] ) should more accurately be replaced by the radius of a kerr bh of the appropriate angular momentum .",
    "this will alter the critical impact parameter at which a bh will form , for given @xmath134 . for two particles each of energy @xmath135 in the center - of - mass frame colliding with impact parameter @xmath136 ,",
    "the total angular momentum with respect to the center of mass is @xmath137 .",

    "this result has been recently confirmed  @xcite in a classical analysis of black hole formation for collisions with non - zero impact parameter .",
    "we see , then , that including the effect of angular momentum also leads to a small reduction of @xmath119 .",
    "while the corrections related to mass ejection and angular momentum both appear to decrease @xmath119 by factors of order 1 , another potential correction to the naive cross section eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) could enhance it by a more - than - compensating factor .",
    "namely , the critical impact parameter may be somewhat larger than the radius of the bh formed .",
    "an argument that supports this conjecture may be given in the case where the incident particles are sub - relativistic with rest mass approximately @xmath146 .",

    "of course , the situation may change considerably in the ultra - relativistic limit , but this estimate , in a limit that we understand , at least makes it plausible that the correct coefficient in eq .",

    "thus our choice to take @xmath151 may well turn out to be conservative .",
    "it could also be argued that the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is too small , because it supposes that a black hole only forms when the two particles come within a schwarzschild radius of each other , when in fact we expect that gravitational collapse will occur for somewhat larger impact parameters as well .",
    "another problem with eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is that while the cross section is measured with respect to the flat geometry of the asymptotic region , the schwarzschild radius is a property of the highly curved region close to the singularity  @xcite .",
    "a better measure of the cross - sectional area associated with a black hole of given mass , which overcomes these objections , is given by the classical cross section for photon capture  @xcite .",
    "if a beam of parallel light rays is sent in towards a schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotically minkowskian region of spacetime , the black hole s classical cross section is defined to be the cross - sectional area of the portion of the beam that gets captured . in four dimensions ,",

    "@xcite ) that @xmath152 independent of the energies of the incoming photons . (",
    "the relevance of this cross section for black hole production has been independently argued in ref .",
    "the maximum impact parameter @xmath153 at which capture occurs is about 2.6 times as large as the schwarzschild radius , and the cross section is enhanced by a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "a straightforward extension of this calculation to schwarzschild black holes in @xmath155 dimensions gives  @xcite @xmath156 for @xmath27 , the cross section is 4 times larger than the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , and for @xmath112 , it is still 87% larger .",
    "thus , the enhancement suggested by this definition of the cross section could be significant and could easily offset other possible reductions . at infinite distance from a black hole of mass @xmath149 and rotation parameter @xmath157 ( as defined in ref .",

    "( [ sigma ] ) should be modified by an exponential suppression factor @xmath160 with @xmath161 the euclidean gibbons  hawking action for the bh , which , in terms of the entropy of eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , is @xmath162    in part , voloshin s critique is based on previous attempts to calculate amplitudes for the production of classical field configurations ( in which the multiplicity is greater than the inverse coupling ) from initial quantum states .",
    "the intrinsically nonperturbative nature of such processes suggests employing an instanton  like approximation , which could lead to exponential suppression .",
    "such an approach can be taken even for processes that are semi - classically allowed ( such as multi - higgs production @xcite ) that do not require tunneling in order to take place .",
    "the problem is not yet solved .",
    "for example , a recent lattice simulation  @xcite shows no evidence for the enhancement of large multiplicity amplitudes manifest in perturbation theory , perhaps counter - indicating the formation of a classical field state in the quantum collision .",
    "we are cognizant of the uniqueness of gravitation ( such as the onset of strong coupling for @xmath163 ) , and the support in favor of the geometric cross section based on classical calculations for both vanishing  @xcite and non - vanishing  @xcite impact parameter .",
    "an additional supporting argument based on a string calculation has been given  @xcite , and the applicability of cpt arguments when comparing black hole formation and decay , an element in voloshin s criticism  @xcite , has been questioned  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness , we will also present results below for the exponentially suppressed cross section of eq .",
    "( [ sigmasupp ] ) . for cosmic rays",
    ", we will see that even with voloshin s suppression factor included , useful bounds will emerge after 5 years of operation of auger .",
    "among the many possible sources of ultra - high energy neutrinos , the cosmogenic flux is the most reliable .",
    "this neutrino flux relies only on the assumption that the observed extremely high energy cosmic rays contain nucleons and are primarily extragalactic in origin .",
    "if the charge of the primaries satisfies @xmath164 , as recently reported  @xcite , an extragalactic origin is almost guaranteed , as the observed nearly isotropic angular distribution strongly disfavors galactic disk sources  @xcite . moreover , even if the absence of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite on cosmic ray energies is a reflection of our coincidental position near a nucleus / nucleon - emitting source , one still expects the full cosmogenic neutrino flux .",
    "briefly , the argument for this is as follows  @xcite : the known astrophysical environments ( within a few mpc of the earth ) are not among the most powerful , but ( in principle ) can produce hadronic cosmic rays with the desired energies when parameters are stretched to their limits .",
    "thus if these less powerful sources can accelerate particles above @xmath165 , it must be that more powerful distant sources ( like fanaroff - riley ii radiogalaxies ) can accelerate protons above photopion threshold , giving rise to the cosmogenic neutrino flux .",

    "in particular , neutral current neutrino cross sections may be enhanced in extra - dimensional scenarios through the exchange of kk gravitons .",
    "this will raise the quasi - horizontal rate , but will have very little effect on the earth - skimming event rate , since neutrinos suffer very little energy loss during this process  @xcite .",
    "we expect such effects , then , to further enhance the ratio @xmath307 , making a sm explanation even more untenable .",
    "so far , we have not explicitly considered the question of distinguishing bh events from other types of new physics .",
    "however , the prediction of enhanced quasi - horizontal event rates _ and _ diminished earth - skimming rates is incisive .",
    "for example , new physics that increases quasi - horizontal rates by enhancing cross sections for @xmath97 will also increase earth - skimming rates .",
    "the prediction of suppressed earth - skimming rates relies on the efficient conversion of neutrino energy directly to hadronic energy , that is , a process with large cross section and large inelasticity .",
    "this is a peculiar property of bhs that separates bh production from other possible forms of new physics .",
    "the comparison between deep quasi - horizontal shower and earth - skimming neutrino rates therefore not only effectively excludes a sm interpretation of bh events , but goes a long way toward excluding other new physics explanations .",
    "in this work we have shown that cosmic ray observations in the recent past ( agasa ) and in the near future ( auger ) provide extremely sensitive probes of low - scale gravity and extra dimensions .",
    "we have focused on the production of tev - scale bhs resulting from collisions of ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos in the earth s atmosphere , and have considered the impact of various theoretical issues in the determination of the bh production cross section . in particular , mass shedding , the production of bhs with non - zero angular momentum , and a possible enhancement of the bh cross section can be expected to give minor perturbations . the exponential suppression proposed by voloshin is more significant , but large and observable bh event rates are still possible .      * present bounds on atmospheric bh production imply 95% cl lower limits on the fundamental planck mass of @xmath308 for @xmath69 , rising to @xmath309 for @xmath112 .",
    "these bounds follow from the non - observation of a significant excess of deep , quasi - horizontal showers in 1710.5 days of running recently reported by the agasa collaboration  @xcite .",
    "+ the absence of a deeply - penetrating signal in the fly s eye data  @xcite also implies lower bounds on @xmath2 .",
    "these are consistently weaker , however .",
    "for example , for @xmath115 , @xmath250 , and the same ( pj ) flux we have used , ringwald and tu find @xmath310  @xcite .",
    "we find this difference to be significant : the agasa and fly s eye constraints rely on identical theoretical assumptions , and given the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , a factor of 2 difference in @xmath21 bounds corresponds to a factor of more than 4 in acceptance or , equivalently , running time .",
    "+ the agasa limits derived here exceed the d  bound @xmath311 tev , where the variation reflects uncertainty from the choice of ultraviolet cutoff for graviton momenta transverse to the brane .",
    "the cosmic ray limits are subject to a separate set of uncertainties , discussed at length above , but follow from conservative evaluations of the neutrino flux and experimental aperture , and @xmath250 . for @xmath230 , these limits are somewhat reduced , but still generally exceed the tevatron bounds . + the cosmic ray bounds from agasa therefore represent the best existing limits on the scale of tev - gravity for @xmath240 extra spatial dimensions .",
    "a summary of the most stringent present bounds on @xmath21 for @xmath312 extra dimensions is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] . + * the reach of agasa will be extended significantly by the auger observatory .",
    "if no quasi - horizontal extended air shower events are observed in 5 years ( beyond the expected two sm neutrino events supplemented by as many as 10 hadronic background events ) , auger will set a limit of @xmath251 , at 95% cl , for @xmath8 . even in the case where the cross section is decreased by the exponential suppression factor in eq .",
    "( [ sigmasupp ] ) , a bound @xmath313 2 tev may be found under the same background assumptions .",
    "* conversely , given the large reach of auger , tens of bh events may be observed per year .",
    "we have discussed in some detail how combined measurements of quasi - horizontal air showers and earth - skimming @xmath314 events may be used to identify new neutrino interactions beyond the sm , even with complete uncertainty about the incident neutrino flux . in the case of bh production ,",
    "the quasi - horizontal event rate is enhanced , while the earth - skimming rate is suppressed , since bh production in the earth acts as an absorptive channel , depleting the sm rate . with counting experiments alone",
    ", one can therefore exclude a sm interpretation of bh events , and may distinguish bh events from almost all other possible forms of new physics .    in conclusion , in the next several years",
    "prior to the analysis of data from the lhc , super - planckian bh production from cosmic rays provides a promising probe of extra dimensions .",
    "searches for bh - initiated quasi - horizontal showers in the earth s atmosphere at agasa provide the most stringent bounds on low - scale gravity at present , and the auger observatory will extend this sensitivity to fundamental planck scales well above the tev scale .    we thank r.  emparan , s.  giddings , a.  ringwald , and g.  sigl for useful communications .",
