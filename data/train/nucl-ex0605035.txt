    "the system created in non central relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision carries large angular orbital momentum .",
    "one of the most interesting and important phenomena predicted to occur in such a system is global system polarization .",
    "the phenomena of global system polarization was first discussed in work @xcite , where theoretical calculation of the globally polarized system produced in non central nucleus - nucleus collision was carried out .",
    "the global polarization originates from transformation of the orbital angular momentum of the system into the particle s spin due to spin - orbital coupling .",
    "the latter leads to the polarization of secondary produced particles along the system orbital momentum @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of @xmath1hyperon global polarization measurement in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 62 and 200 gev with the star detector at rhic .",
    "particles produced in a system with large angular orbital momentum @xmath3 are predicted to be polarized along the normal to the collision reaction plane due to spin - orbital coupling @xcite .",
    "this global polarization can be determined from the angular distribution of hyperons decay product with respect to the system orbital momentum @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hyperon global polarization , @xmath6 is the hyperon s decay parameter , @xmath7 is the angle between the system orbital momentum @xmath3 and the hyperon s decay products 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame .",
    "since the source for the global polarization is the angular orbital momentum @xmath3 and this angular momentum is perpendicular to the reaction plane , the global polarization could be measured via correlations with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "thus the known and well established anisotropic flow measurement techniques @xcite may be applied .    in order to write the equation for the global polarization in terms of the convenient observables used in anisotropic flow measurements we start with an equation that directly follows from the global polarization definition ( [ globalpolarizationdefinition ] ) :",
    "@xmath8 the brackets in this equation denotes averaging over all possible directions of the hyperon s decay product 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame and over all directions of the system orbital momentum @xmath3 or , in other words , over all possible orientation of the reaction plane .",
    "similarly we can write the equation for the global polarization in terms of reaction plane angle @xmath9 and the azimuthal angle @xmath10 of the hyperon s decay product 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame . by using the geometrical relation between the angles , namely @xmath11",
    "( @xmath12 is the angle between hyperon s decay product 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame and beam direction ) , and integrating angular distribution ( [ globalpolarizationdefinition ] ) over the angle @xmath12 , one ends up with the following equation for the global polarization : @xmath13 note that in this equation , perfect detector acceptance is assumed . to take into account the hyperon s reconstruction acceptance one has to correct the result on @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and the integral extends over detector acceptance .",
    "the equation ( [ globalpolarizationobservable ] ) is very similar to those used in directed flow measurements @xcite .",
    "for example , the hyperon s directed flow @xmath16 could be measured as : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the angle of the hyperon s transverse momentum .",
    "this similarity allows us to use anisotropic flow measurement techniques . in this paper",
    "we follow the same naming conventions and notations adopted in anisotropic flow analysis .",
    "this analysis is based on @xmath1hyperons reconstructed with the star main tpc .",
    "the decay channel used to reconstruct @xmath1hyperons in star is @xmath19 @xcite ; the corresponding decay papameter is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 global polarization is calculated based on equation ( [ globalpolarizationobservable ] ) . as in anisotropic flow measurements , one can _ estimate _ the reaction plane angle based on the information on all produced particles by calculating the so called @xmath21-harmonic event plane vector @xmath22 .",
    "this implies the necessity to correct the final results by the event plane resolution @xmath23 ( see @xcite for more details ) . in the global polarization measurement ,",
    "knowledge of the system orbital momentum @xmath3 orientation is required , and thus it is required to obtain the first order event plane vector @xmath24 . taking this into account",
    "one can write equation ( [ globalpolarizationobservable ] ) for the case of @xmath1 global polarization in terms of the first order event plane angle @xmath25 and its resolution @xmath26 : @xmath27 in this paper , the first order event plane vector is determined based on particles measured in star forward tpc ( covered pseudo - rapidity region is @xmath28 ) .",
    "fig.[lambdaglobalpolarization_pt ] shows measured @xmath1hyperon global polarization as a function of @xmath1 transverse momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the black circles indicate results from the measurement based on the 8 million minimum bias events obtained with the star detector during rhic run iv ( year 2004 ) for au+au collisions at @xmath2=200gev .",
    "the gray squares are from similar measurement based on the 9 million minimum bias events for au+au collisions at @xmath2=62gev .",
    "although the error bars at higher @xmath1 transverse momentum are rather large , fig.[lambdaglobalpolarization_pt ] hints at a possible @xmath30 dependence of the global polarization .",
