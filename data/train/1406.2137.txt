    "during the last years , frames have had a tremendous impact on applications due to their unique ability to deliver redundant , yet stable expansions .",
    "the redundancy of a frame is typically utilized by applications which either require robustness of the frame coefficients to noise , erasures , quantization , etc . or require sparse expansions in the frame .",
    "more precisely , letting @xmath0 be a frame , either _ decompositions _ into a sequence of frame coefficients of a signal @xmath1 , which is the image of @xmath2 under the analysis operator @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are exploited by applications such as telecommunications and imaging sciences , or _",
    "expansions _ in terms of the frame , i.e. , @xmath5 with suitable choice of coefficients @xmath6 , are required by applications such as efficient pde solvers .",
    "intriguingly , the novel area of compressed sensing is based on the fact that typically signals exhibit a sparse expansion in a frame , which is nowadays considered the standard paradigm in data processing . some compressed sensing applications also",
    "` hope ' that the sequence of frame coefficients itself is sparse ; a connection deeply studied in a series of papers on _ cosparsity _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the discussed applications certainly require stability , numerically as well as theoretically .",
    "for instance , notice that most results in compressed sensing are stated for tight frames , i.e. , for optimal stability .",
    "it is known that such frames  in the case of normalized vectors  can be characterized by the frame potential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and construction methods have been derived ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for an algebro - geometric point of view ) .",
    "however , a crucial question remains : given a frame with desirable properties , can we turn it into a tight frame ?",
    "the immediate answer is yes , since it can easily be shown that applying @xmath7 to each frame element , @xmath8 denoting the frame operator @xmath9 , produces a parseval frame . thinking further",
    "one however realizes a serious problem with this seemingly elegant approach ; it typically completely destroys any properties of the frame for which it was carefully designed before . thus ,",
    "unless we are merely interested in theoretical considerations , this approach is unacceptable .",
    "trying to be as careful as possible , the most noninvasive approach seems to merely scale each frame vector , i.e. , multiply it by a scalar . and , indeed , almost all frame properties one can think of such as erasure resilience or sparse expansions are left untouched by this modification . in fact , this approach is currently extensively studied under the theme of scalable frames .",
    "the notion of a _",
    "scalable frame _ was first introduced in @xcite as a frame whose frame vectors can be rescaled to yield a tight frame . recall that a sequence @xmath0 forms a _ frame _ provided that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are called the _ frame bounds_. one often also writes @xmath14 for the @xmath15 matrix whose @xmath16th column is the vector @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 , the frame is called a _",
    "tight frame_. furthermore , @xmath19 produces a _",
    "parseval frame_. in the sequel , the set of frames with @xmath20 vectors in @xmath21 will be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to frame theory and to @xcite for an overview of the current research in the field .",
    "a frame @xmath23 for @xmath21 is called ( _ strictly _ ) _ scalable _ if there exist nonnegative ( positive , respectively ) scalars @xmath24 such that @xmath25 is a tight frame for @xmath21 .",
    "the set of ( strictly ) scalable frames is denoted by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "this definition obviously allows one to restrict the study to the class of unit norm frames @xmath28 and further to substitute tight frame by parseval frame in the above definition .",
    "therefore a frame @xmath29 is scalable if and only if there exist non - negative scalars @xmath30 such that @xmath31    in @xcite , characterizations of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , both of functional analytic and geometric type were derived in the infinite as well as finite dimensional setting . as a sequel , using topological considerations , it was proved in @xcite",
    "that the set of scalable frames , @xmath26 , is a ` small ' subset of @xmath22 when @xmath20 is relatively small and a yet different characterization using a particular mapping was derived .",
    "this last mapping is closely related to the so - called diagram vectors / mapping in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "arbitrary scalars in @xmath32 were allowed , and it was shown that in this case most frames are either not scalable or scalable in a unique way and , if uniqueness is not given , the set of all possible sequences of scalars is studied .",
    "however , in the applied world , scalability seems too idealistic , in particular , if our frame at hand is not scalable .",
    "this calls for a measure of ` closeness to being scalable ' .",
    "it is though not obvious how to define such a measure , and one can easily justify different points of view of what ` closeness ' shall mean .",
    "let us discuss the following three viewpoints :    * _ distance to @xmath26 .",
    "_ maybe the most straightforward approach is to measure the distance of a frame @xmath33 to the set of scalable frames : @xmath34 this notion seems natural if we anticipate efficient algorithmic approaches for computing the closest scalable frame by projections onto @xmath26 . * _ conical viewpoint . _ inspired by ,",
    "we observe that @xmath14 is scalable if and only if the identity operator @xmath35 lies in the cone generated by the vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , which is @xmath38 .",
    "thus the distance of @xmath35 to this cone seems to be another suitable measure for scalability of @xmath33 , and we define @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the frobenius norm . note that the minimum is attained because this polyhedral cone is closed .",
    "this conical viewpoint leads to a computationally efficient algorithm , since we can recast the problem as a quadratic program ( see section [ sec : complexity ] ) . * _ ellipsoidal viewpoint .",
    "_ finally , one can consider the ellipsoid of minimal volume ( also known as the lwner ellipsoid ) circumscribing the convex hull of the symmetrized frame of @xmath33 : @xmath41 which in the sequel we denote by @xmath42 and refer to as the _ minimal ellipsoid of @xmath14_. its ` normalized ' volume is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath21 . by definition , we have @xmath45 , and we will later show ( theorem [ pro : iff ] ) that @xmath46 holds if and only if the frame @xmath14 is scalable . hence , yet another conceivably useful measure for scalability is the closeness of @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "this ellipsoidal viewpoint establishes a novel link to convex geometry .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that this measure is of particular use when estimating the probability of a random frame being scalable .",
    "each notion seems justified from a different perspective , and hence there is no ` general truth ' for what the best measure is .",
    "our contributions are three - fold : first , we introduce the scalability measures @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath47 , derive estimates for their values , and study their relations in theorems  [ thm_vd ] and [ thm : comp ] .",
    "second , with theorems [ pro : iff ] and [ pro : ns ] we provide new necessary and sufficient conditions for scalability based on the ellipsoidal viewpoint . and ,",
    "third , we estimate the probability of a frame being scalable when each frame vector is drawn independently and uniformly from the unit sphere ( see theorem [ thm : pro ] ) .",
    "we anticipate our results to have the following impacts :    * _ constructions of scalable frames : _ one construction procedure which is a byproduct of our analysis is to consider random frames with the probability of scalability being explicitly given .",
    "however , certainly , there is the need for more sophisticated efficient algorithmic approaches .",
    "but with the measures provided in our work , the groundwork is laid for analyzing their accuracy .",
    "* _ extensions of scalability : _ one might also imagine other methodological approaches to modify a frame to become tight . if sparse approximation properties is what one seeks , another possibility is to be allowed to take linear combinations of ` few ' frame vectors in the spirit of the ` double sparsity ' approach in @xcite .",
    "the introduced three quality measures provide an understanding of scalability which we hope might allow an attack on analyzing those approaches as well . * _ @xmath51-scalability : _ one key question even more important to applications than scalability is that of what is typically loosely coined @xmath51-scalability , meaning a frame which is scalable ` up to an @xmath51 ' , but which was not precisely defined before .",
    "the scalability measures now immediately provide even three definitions of @xmath51-scalability in a very natural way , opening three doors to approaching this problem . * _ convex geometry : _ the ellipsoidal viewpoint of scalability provides a very interesting link between frame theory and convex geometry .",
    "theorem [ pro : ns ] and theorem [ thm : pro ] are results about frames using convex geometry tools ; theorem [ thm : cha ] is a result about minimal ellipsoids exploiting frame theory .",
    "we strongly expect the link established in this paper to bear further fruits in frame theory , in particular the approach of regarding frames from a convex geometric viewpoint by analyzing the convex hull of a ( symmetrized ) frame .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ,",
    "[ sec : measures ] , the three measures of closeness of a given frame to be scalable are introduced in three respective subsections and some basic properties are studied .",
    "this is followed by a comparison of the measures both theoretically and numerically ( section [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : prob ] we exploit those results to analyze the probability of a frame to be scalable .",
    "interestingly , along the way we derive necessary and sufficient ( deterministic ) conditions for a frame to be scalable ( see subsection [ subsec : necsuffconditions ] ) .",
    "in this section , we explore some basic properties of the three measures of scalibility which we introduced in the previous section . as mentioned before , we consider only unit norm frames .",
    "recall that the measure @xmath49 was defined as the distance of @xmath14 to the set of scalable frames : @xmath52 since the set @xmath26 is not closed ( choose @xmath53 , then @xmath54 is a sequence in @xmath26 which converges to the zero matrix ) , it is not clear whether the infimum in is attained .",
    "the following proposition , however , shows that this is the case if @xmath55 .",
    "[ p : closed ] if @xmath33 such that @xmath56 then there exists @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 , and @xmath60 be a sequence of scalable frames such that @xmath61 .",
    "the sequence @xmath62 is bounded as @xmath63 so without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath62 converges to some @xmath64 . it remains to prove that @xmath65 is scalable .",
    "for this , denote by @xmath66 the @xmath16-th column of @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and all @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 be a non - negative diagonal matrix such that @xmath72 .",
    "now , for each @xmath73 and each @xmath69 we have @xmath74 therefore , each sequence @xmath75 is bounded .",

    ", it is easy to see that @xmath78 converges to @xmath79 as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",

    "for this reason , we introduce two other measures of scalability in the remainder of this section which are more accessible in practice .",
    "we will relate these measures to each other and to @xmath49 in section [ sec : comp ] .      as mentioned in the introduction , the measure @xmath107 for the scalability of @xmath33 is the distance of the identity operator on @xmath21 to the cone generated by @xmath108 .",
