    "the decrease from @xmath153 to @xmath233 in the last part of the tuple can be first by steps of one , possibly followed by steps of @xmath233 .",
    "first , we observe that any tuple in @xmath367 corresponds to a tuple in @xmath368 with the only difference being that the number of @xmath153 s exceeds exactly by one .",
    "there are also new tuples in @xmath368 that do not correspond in this way to tuples in @xmath367 ; they arise in two different manners .",
    "one way they arise in @xmath368 is when the upper bound for @xmath153 is increased by one .",
    "such a tuple appears in @xmath359 whenever @xmath339 is even .",
    "similarly , such a tuple occurs in @xmath360 when @xmath369 .",
    "this is summarized in the first two rows of table [ recursion ] .",
    "the other way new tuples arise in @xmath368 is when there is a tuple in @xmath370 with at least one decrease by a step of two . here",
    ", the tuple in @xmath370 corresponds to the tuple in @xmath360 in which the leftmost decrease by a step of two is replaced by two decreases of step one .",
    "a tuple in @xmath371 with more than one decrease by two will correspond to a new tuple in @xmath370 in this manner ; this new tuple , in turn , will correspond to a new tuple in @xmath360 in the same way .",
    "thus , the number of new tuples in @xmath367 , @xmath372 , is close to the number of new tuples we obtain in this way , though we must make some adjustments",
    ". the value @xmath372 will count the new tuple in @xmath373 when @xmath339 is odd ; thus we must subtract one when @xmath339 is odd . additionally , if a tuple in @xmath371 has only one decrease by a step of two , we need to account for this . recall that when @xmath369 , a new tuple arises in @xmath360 because the upper bound for @xmath153 has increased .",
    "this tuple has @xmath374 decreases by step two . because @xmath339 and @xmath375 have odd / even parity when @xmath369 , we see that there is a tuple in @xmath371 with a single decrease by two only when @xmath339 is even",
