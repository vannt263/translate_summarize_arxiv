    "spontaneous emission is a well established fundamental phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it occurs due to interaction of excited emitters with the vacuum modes of the environmental electromagnetic field reservoir .",
    "useful applications of spontaneous radiation control may arise , for instance , in higher frequency coherent light generation @xcite or spontaneous parametric down conversion processes @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "spontaneous emission often plays a negative role in quantum processing of information @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that a significant amount of work is carried out regarding its control .",
    "particularly , earlier approaches to influence the spontaneous emission were by using optical cavities @xcite . a modern and more advanced version of those ideas consists in using photonic crystals environments where photon forbidden bands occur leading to spontaneous emission inhibition or localization @xcite .",
    "infrequent application to a two - level atom of microwave pulses @xcite or sequence of pulses @xcite , or rather intense low - frequency coherent fields @xcite ( see also @xcite ) lead to spontaneous emission control as well .",
    "quenching of spontaneous emission occurs as well via involving quantum interference effects between various decaying pathways which are dependent on mutual orientation of corresponding transition dipoles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lamb shift of laser - dressed atomic states and quantum interferences due to energy shifts and their effect on spontaneous emission were investigated too , in refs .",
    "one can also control the spontaneous emission by periodically shifting the atomic transition frequency from the atom - cavity resonance @xcite or via coupling a single state to a continuum of many states @xcite .",
    "remarkably , periodically perturbed atomic transitions lead to a number of fascinating effects such as induced transparency or extreme ultra - short pulses , respectively @xcite .",

    "@xmath1 is the single - qubit spontaneous decay rate in the absence of modulation.,width=283 ]    here , we demonstrate suppression of spontaneous decay of a two - level system ( qubit ) that is embedded in a broadband electromagnetic field reservoir and is subjected to an intense , time - dependent , frequency modulation driving force .",
    "the suppression is a direct consequence of quantum interference effects induced by the modulation .",
    "a frequency shift to the transition frequency is induced as well .",
    "furthermore , the absolute phase of the modulation can be a convenient tool to control these processes .",
    "coherent modulation of the transition frequency leads to appearance of new decay channels that may interfere destructively contributing to spontaneous emission inhibition ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this occurs when the frequency of modulation is of the order of the bare - state qubit s decay rate or less .",
    "the spontaneous emission is described by an exponential decaying law with a time - dependent decay rate and exhibiting plateaus with a very slow decoherence rate .",
    "the quantum decoherence due to spontaneous emission can be further minimized via stronger frequency modulation depths . moreover , the induced time - dependent frequency shift depends on external control parameters , such as the applied intensity and the external field amplitude absolute phase , and can be influenced accordingly .",
    "it vanishes , however , at resonance and in the absence of quantum interference effects due to frequency modulation processes . in a free - space setup , the spontaneous emission inhibition is less probable via transition frequency modulation of an excited two - level emitter .",
    "this deviation to @xcite arises because our treatment is classical and especially limited to moderately intense modulating fields .",
    "our system can be implemented , for example , via off - resonant laser driving of a two - level emitter @xcite .",
    "one can apply a laser field with a high non - resonant frequency @xmath2 and possessing a periodically modulated amplitude of the field strength @xmath3 with @xmath4 to a two - level atom of frequency @xmath5 .",
    "then a modulated shift @xmath6 of the transition frequency is achieved via the quadratic stark effect , i.e. , @xmath6=@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the modulation amplitude .",
    "additional systems can be molecules or quantum dots , even those possessing permanent dipoles @xcite . when pumped with an intense low - frequency coherent field",
    ", the amplitude of the frequency modulation will be proportional to the magnitude of the permanent dipole multiplied by the external field strength",
    ". an alternative scheme can be as well a two - level quantum dot embedded in a broadband microcavity and interacting with a surface acoustic wave coherently modulating its transition frequency @xcite .",

    "obviously , this illustration scheme can be extended to @xmath86 ( see fig .",

    "the solid and long - dashed curves describe the spontaneous decay processes when the transition frequency is modulated with a modulation depth @xmath93 and a phase @xmath94 or @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the phase - dependence is a clear evidence of quantum interference effects .",

    "the almost decoherence - free plateaus observed in fig .",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we have fixed the evolution time at @xmath100 and changed the modulation depth @xmath96 accordingly . at lower modulation amplitudes , or in its absence , the qubit is in the ground state at this evolution stage .",
    "as it was already mentioned , stronger modulation depths contribute to a further slowing of the quantum decoherence .",
    "the reason is the interplay between interference effects among multiple decay channels described above and the frequency modulation dressing of the corresponding decay rates ( see eq .",

    "certain molecules possess this property too , i.e. @xmath105 @xcite .    finally , while we have considered a broad - band cavity environmental reservoir , the multiple induced decay interference approach developed may also be applied for quantized vacuum modes of free - space in a related setup @xcite , for instance . there",

    "those process s scaling show an interplay between different relevant detunings and applied intensity strengths such that one can stop at a particular @xmath65- photon process @xcite ( see appendix b ) .",
    "summarizing , we have demonstrated how quantum decay interference phenomena induced among multiple decaying channels occurring due to moderately intense transition frequency modulation of a two - level emitter embedded in a broadband electromagnetic field reservoir together with frequency modulation dressing of the spontaneous decay rates can suppress quantum dissipations due to spontaneous emission .",

    "in this appendix , we shall focus on the spontaneous decay of an excited two - level emitter with modulated transition frequency via usual vacuum modes of the emf reservoir .",
    "the purpose is to show that an unshaped vacuum is not sufficient for the spontaneous emission suppression investigated here . for convenience",
    "we derive the modulation hamiltonian entering in eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) . for this",
    ", one considers that a moderately strong low - frequency coherent field is applied to a two - state atom being initially in its excited state .",
    "the hamiltonian of this process is : @xmath108 here , @xmath5 is the transition frequency among the states @xmath109 while @xmath110 is the corresponding rabi frequency with @xmath23 being the frequency of the external applied low - frequency coherent field .",
    "the atom - vacuum coupling strength is : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is quantized volume while @xmath113 is the polarization vector with @xmath114 .",
    "we apply a unitary transformation to the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) , i.e. @xmath115 , where @xmath116}$ ] .",
    "this transformation is useful as it allows to represent the hamiltonian via @xmath117photon processes involved , namely : @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "it is easy to observe that the even - photon processes with @xmath120 correspond to modulation of the transition frequency , while the odd - photon processes , i.e. @xmath121 lead to induced transitions among the involved energy levels . for our purposes one requires @xmath122 as well as @xmath123 . under these restrictions , i.e. taking into account that : @xmath124^{4}\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the working hamiltonian is : @xmath125 here , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "thus , we have considered that the frequency modulation takes place via two- and four - photon processes , simultaneously , while higher - photon effects are negligible because one can always select a system with @xmath129 , and for an even @xmath71 with @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , the induced transitions through odd - photon processes among the involved energy levels do not occur because of the off - resonance and , therefore , are ignored here ( i.e. the second line of the hamiltonian [ hpf ] ) .",
    "the master equation describing the spontaneous decay of a two - level radiator with modulated transition frequency in free - space according to the hamiltonian ( [ hpt ] ) and in the born - markov , dipole and rotating wave approximations has the form : @xmath131\\rangle + h.c .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{mqq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 with @xmath133 here , @xmath134 is the cauchy principal value , while @xmath135 is the free - space single - atom spontaneous decay rate in the absence of frequency modulation @xcite .    in the following , we consider that @xmath88 while @xmath136 , i.e. the frequency modulation via simultaneous four - photon processes are negligible",
    "this can be achieved in the weak field regime , for example , when @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that is , one has @xmath139 while @xmath140 .",
    "for this reason we do not expect to obtain the quantum interference effects without a cavity like in @xcite .",
    "thus , the motivation to keep the modulation of the transition frequency due to a simultaneous four - photon process in the hamiltonian ( [ hpt ] ) as well as in the master equation ( [ mqq ] ) , i.e. the term proportional to @xmath141 , was to show that spontaneous decay via the induced absorption / emission of four photons is taking place also due to transition frequency modulation via a two - photon process described by @xmath8 ( for instance when @xmath142 ) .",
    "this latter process is more probable than the corresponding one due to @xmath141 .",
    "figure ( [ fig5 ] ) shows the spontaneous decay law of an excited atom in free space , i.e. @xmath143}-1/2 $ ] where @xmath144 with @xmath145 , when @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , and for some particular parameters of interest . while the spontaneous decay is clearly slowed down for @xmath148 one can not predict what is the particular value of @xmath149 which would be realized in a real experiment .",
    "furthermore , larger values of @xmath149 with a fixed @xmath150 do not lead to spontaneous emission inhibition .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the spontaneous emission will be inhibited in free - space via transition frequency modulation of an excited two - level emitter unless and until we are not able to select a particular @xmath149-photon process .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a related mechanism was discussed where an effective two level system was driven with a quantum field with frequency @xmath23 of the order of the linewidth of the considered transition . since in reality",
    "the low - frequency field will also couple off - resonantly to all transitions in the atom , one can justify a hamilton operator with extra interference terms as indicated in detail in the ref .",
    "@xcite with the consequence of possible spontaneous emission elimination .",
    "the physics behind atom pumping with a classical low frequency field in the weak field approximation or a quantized low frequency field consists in the fact that in the first case only modulation of the transition frequency occurs which does not affect the spontaneous emission in free space , while in the second case additional transitions are induced that may interfere leading to modification of the spontaneous decay . particularly , in @xcite",
    "a quantized low frequency strong field was interacting with a two - level atom being initially in its excited state @xmath151 . in order to adequately describe",
    "the system the far - off resonant coupling to the other states was included as well .    in",
    "what follows , we recall in a somewhat different simplified way how the additional terms due to off - resonant coupling may appear in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "if as an example one considers a two - level atom with one extra far off - resonant state @xmath152 and with its energy levels from down to up denoted as @xmath153 and @xmath152 , respectively , then the quantized low frequency applied field will induce additional transitions via the path @xmath154 here @xmath155 are the corresponding coefficients due to strong external pumping and obtained after elimination of the far - laying excited level @xmath152 , while @xmath156 is the photon creation ( annihilation ) operator for the external low frequency quantized intense field .",
    "one can show ( see the last entry of @xcite ) that the hamiltonian ( [ b1 ] ) does not affect the transition @xmath157 when it is dipole allowed .",
    "therefore , the spontaneous emission modification scheme described in this part applies to dipole - forbidden atomic transitions . since in a three - level atomic system",
    "one transition should be dipole - forbidden it results that the decay on @xmath157 atomic transition may indeed be dipole - forbidden .",
    "the excited state population will be described by the following equation : @xmath158 here , @xmath159 is the two - photon spontaneous decay rate on transition @xmath157 , while @xmath160 is the corresponding decay involving additional upper states .",
    "one can observe that the strong quantized field indeed modifies the upper state population .",
    "notice that a strong classical low frequency laser field will only modulate the frequency on a dipole - allowed transition and , correspondingly , the spontaneous emission will not be modified in free space ( see also appendix a ) . for dipole - forbidden @xmath161 transitions the off - resonant coupling to another state @xmath152 will also modulate the transition frequency as well as induce transitions to the ground state @xmath162 based on a hamiltonian of the next form : @xmath163 the spontaneous decay rate on the @xmath157 atomic transition may be @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , the classical off - resonant coupling to another state may not change significantly the decay rate because @xmath165 .",
    "in a two - level atomic system with two extra far off - resonant states , the spontaneous emission can be modified due to an applied strong quantized low frequency field even on a dipole - allowed @xmath166 transition in accordance with the results given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for instance , one of the terms in the total hamiltonian describing the decay via the path @xmath167 after the elimination of the additional higher energy levels is : @xmath168 such terms are responsible for the spontaneous decay modification in free - space through a quantized and strong low frequency applied field . on the other side , in an idealised situation of ignoring the presence of any other far - off resonant states in the atomic system and when",
    "neglecting strong field terms of the low frequency field , the presence of such interference terms could not be reproduced via a classical pumping field .",

    "<S> , one can induce quantum interference effects and , consequently , quantum coherences among multiple decaying transition pathways . depending on the modulation depth and its absolute phase , </S>",
    "<S> both the spontaneous emission and the frequency shift may be conveniently modified and controlled . </S>"
