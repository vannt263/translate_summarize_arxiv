    "in recent years , the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary constant , derived by camassa and holm @xcite as a shallow water wave model , has attracted much attention in the theory of soliton and integrable system .",
    "the ch equation was implied in the work of fuchssteiner and fokas on hereditary symmetries as a very special case @xcite . since the work of camassa and holm @xcite , more diverse studies on this equation have been remarkably developed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) is that it admits peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "a peakon is a weak solution in some sobolev space with corner at its crest .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch equation , other integrable models with peakon solutions have been found @xcite-@xcite . among these models , there are two integrable peakon equations with cubic nonlinearity , which are @xmath8_x , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{cchq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath9 equation ( [ cchq ] ) was proposed independently by fokas ( 1995 ) @xcite , fuchssteiner ( 1996 ) @xcite , olver and rosenau ( 1996 ) @xcite , and qiao ( 2006 ) @xcite where the lax pair and peaked / cusped solitons are presented .",
    "equation ( [ cchq ] ) is the first cubic nonlinear integrable system possessing peakon solutions .",
    "recently , the peakon stability of equation ( [ cchq ] ) with @xmath2 was worked out by gui , liu , olver and qu @xcite . in 2009",
    ", novikov @xcite derived another cubic equation , which is equation ( [ cchn ] ) , from the symmetry approach , and hone and wang @xcite gave its lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , and peakon solutions .",
    "very recently @xcite , we derived the lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , peakons , weak kinks , kink - peakon interactional and smooth soliton solutions for the following integrable equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity : @xmath10_x+\\frac{1}{2}k_2(2 m u_x+ m_xu ) , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{gch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are three arbitrary constants .",
    "it is very interesting for us to study the multi - component integrable generalizations of peakon equations .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors proposed the two - component generalizations of the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) with @xmath2 , and in @xcite , the authors present the two - component extensions of the cubic nonlinear equation ( [ cchn ] ) and equation ( [ cchq ] ) with @xmath2 . in this paper , we propose the following two - component system with cubic nonlinearity and linear dispersion @xmath0_x-\\frac{1}{2}m(uv_x - u_xv ) , \\\\ n_t = bv_{x}+\\frac{1}{2 } [ n(uv - u_xv_x)]_x+\\frac{1}{2 } n(uv_x - u_xv ) , \\\\m = u - u_{xx},~~ n = v - v_{xx } , \\end{array}\\right . \\label{eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is an arbitrary real constant .",

    "thus it is a kind of two - component extensions of equation ( [ ch ] ) , ( [ cchq ] ) and ( [ gch ] ) with a linear dispersive term .",
    "we prove integrability of system ( [ eq ] ) by providing its lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , and infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "geometrically system ( [ eq ] ) describes pseudo - spherical surfaces and thus it is also integrable in the sense of geometry . in the case of @xmath2 ( dispersionless case ) , we show that this system admits the single - peakon of traveling wave solution as well as multi - peakon solutions . in particular , the two - peakon dynamic system is explicitly solved and their interactions are investigated in details . in the case of @xmath3 ( dispersion case ) , we find that the two - component system ( [ eq ] ) possesses the weak kink solution . moreover , by imposing the complex conjugate reduction @xmath5 to system ( [ eq ] ) , we obtain a new integrable nonlinear schrdinger type equation @xmath4_x-\\frac{1}{2}m(uu^\\ast_x - u_xu^\\ast ) , \\quad m = u - u_{xx } , \\label{nlseq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath16 denotes the complex conjugate of a potential .",
    "the complex valued @xmath6-peakon solution and weak kink solution for this nonlinear schrdinger type system are also proposed .",
