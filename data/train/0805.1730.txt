    "mira ( @xmath0  ceti ) is a mass - losing star on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "it is the archetype of a class of pulsating , long - period variables , characterized by regular pulsations ( with periods of order hundreds of days ) and large - amplitude variations in optical brightness ( by up to @xmath68 mag ; e.g. , reid & goldston 2002 ) .",
    "mira is also a member of a wind - accreting binary system , mira  ab , with a projected separation of @xmath6@xmath7 ( @xmath654  au ; matthews & karovska 2006 ) .    despite being the subject of observational scrutiny for many decades",
    ", mira continues to yield surprises .",
    "recently , using far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) imaging data from the _ galex _  satellite , martin et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter m07 ) discovered that mira is surrounded by a bow shock structure and sports a spectacular cometary - like tail , stretching two degrees ( @xmath64  pc ) on the sky .",
    "mira has a rather high space velocity [ @xmath6128  with respect to the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; see   [ nrt ] ] , and",
    "the tail extends backwards along its direction of motion .",
    "this tail is believed to arise from the interaction of mira s wind with the ambient medium as the star moves supersonically through the ism .",
    "the tail is the first of its kind ever discovered , and m07 proposed that its fuv emission arises from h@xmath8 molecules that are collisionally excited by turbulent mixing between the cool molecular gas and the electrons from a shock - heated gas component .",
    "we recently observed mira in the  21-cm line using the nanay  radio telescope ( nrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) as part of a larger , ongoing  survey program of the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars ( see grard & le  bertre 2006 ; matthews & reid 2007 ) .",
    "is now known to be common in circumstellar environments and frequently shows evidence of extending to very large distances from the star ( @xmath91  pc ; grard & le  bertre 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "mira was previously observed in  by bowers & knapp ( 1988 ) , and for more than a decade remained the only agb star known to have associated emission .",
    "unfortunately , the data of bowers & knapp had a signal - to - noise too low to permit a detailed investigation of the morphology and kinematics of the circumstellar material , although these authors did report tentative evidence for an interaction between the circumstellar debris and the surrounding ism .",
    "more recently , nrt observations of mira by grard & le  bertre ( 2006 ) provided a significantly improved  line profile showing a roughly triangular shape , similar to that previously seen in co ( e.g. , winters et al . 2003 ) , as well as evidence for a northward extension of the emission .",
    "however , the coarse spatial resolution of the nanay  beam provided little detail on the  distribution close to the star . to better characterize the extent and morphology of the  envelope of mira",
    ", we therefore obtained new imaging observations with the vla . as we describe here",
    ", the fortuitous timing of our observations provides a powerful complement to the recent _ galex _ results for understanding the mass - loss history of mira . to probe the most extended , lowest column density material in the recently discovered fuv tail , we have also obtained new mapping observations of an extended region around mira using the nrt .",
    "mira was observed in the  21-cm line with the vla on 2007 april 1 , april 30 and may 11 using the most compact ( d ) configuration ( 0.035 - 1.0  km baselines ) .",
    "this provided sensitivity to emission on scales of up to 15@xmath10 .",
    "the primary beam of the vla at our observing frequency of @xmath61420.3  mhz was @xmath11 .",
    "the vla correlator was used in dual polarization ( 2ac ) mode with a 0.78  mhz bandpass , yielding 256 spectral channels with 3.05  khz ( @xmath60.64  ) spacing .",
    "the band was centered at a velocity of 25  relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) ; the band center was offset slightly from the systemic velocity of the star ( @xmath12=46.7  ) to avoid placing a strong galactic feature near the edge of the band .",
    "observations of mira were interspersed with observations of two phase calibrators ( j0201 - 115 and j0220 - 019 ) approximately every 20 minutes .",
    "3c48 was used as an absolute flux calibrator , and an additional strong point source ( j2253 + 161 ) was observed as a bandpass calibrator . to insure that the absolute flux scale and bandpass calibration were not corrupted by galactic emission in the band ,",
    "the flux and bandpass calibrators were each observed twice , first with the band shifted by @xmath131  mhz and then by @xmath14  mhz , relative to the band center used for the observations of mira and the phase calibrators .",
    "we estimate that this method yields an absolute flux scale accurate to @xmath610 - 15% .    at the time of our observations ,",
    "the vla contained 23 working antennas , 9 of which had been retrofitted as part of the expanded very large array ( evla ) upgrade . in total , 10.25 hours of integration were obtained on mira .",
    "however , some data were lost due to shadowing or hardware problems , and significant flagging to excise radio frequency interference ( rfi ) was necessary , resulting in a loss of @xmath613% of the observed visibilities . during our first observing session , roughly half of the baselines had to be flagged in all channels numbering integral multiples of 12 , 13 , and 14 , owing to a strong local rfi source that emitted an interference `` comb '' . the source of this rfi",
    "was identified as the small radio telescope at the vla visitor center , and was switched off during the subsequent two observing sessions .",
    "our vla data were calibrated and reduced using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . to avoid closure errors on vla - evla baselines , we computed and applied a bandpass solution to the raw data before proceeding with any further calibration ( g. van moorsel , private communication ) .",
    "a new frequency - averaged dataset was then computed and used to calibrate the frequency - independent complex gains ( see table  1 ) . following this , a second correction to the bandpass",
    "was computed and applied , and time - dependent frequency shifts were applied to the data to compensate for changes caused by the earth s motion .",
    "finally , prior to imaging , the @xmath15-@xmath16 data were continuum - subtracted using a linear fit to the real and imaginary components of the visibilities .",
    "channels 20 - 85 and 105 - 160 were determined to be line - free and were used for these fits . these channel ranges correspond to lsr velocities of 52.7@xmath1794.6  and 4.4@xmath1739.8  , respectively .",
    "the continuum subtraction procedure was also effective at removing frequency - independent patterns in the channel images caused by solar contamination .",
    "we imaged the vla line data using the standard aips clean deconvolution algorithm and produced data cubes using several different weighting schemes , two of which are presented here ( table  2 ) .",
    "we also produced an image of the 21-cm continuum emission in the region using a vector average of the line - free portion of the band .",

    "our lower resolution  map ( left ) reveals a distinct `` head - tail '' structure , stretching roughly 12@xmath10 ( @xmath60.4  pc ) on the sky .",
    "[ note that the full extent of the  is significantly greater than seen here ( see   [ nrt ] ) , but the vla is insensitive to the more extended emission . ]",
    "we see that the brightest  emission is concentrated near the position of mira itself .",
    "a trail of emission then extends to the northeast , following the same position angle as the fuv tail .    in our higher resolution  map ( figure  [ fig : mom0 ] , right ) ,",
    "some fraction of the total emission is lost ( as it falls below our rejection threshold ) , but we see that on smaller scales the  morphology of mira becomes clumpy and complex .",
    "the location of the peak intensity of the  emission shows a small but statistically significant offset to the southwest of the star s fuv position : ( @xmath33)=(@xmath17@xmath34@xmath21@xmath35,@xmath17@xmath36@xmath21@xmath37 ) .",
    "this offset is comparable to the radius of the molecular envelope of mira found by josselin et al .",
    "( 2000)consistent with the possibility that the bulk of mira s wind is molecular when it leaves the star , but subsequently is partially dissociated , preferentially in the direction of the leading edge of the shock front .",
    "close to the star , it is clear that the  emission is not symmetrically distributed about mira , but exhibits an enhancement to the northwest .",
    "an enhancement in  emission was also seen along this direction by josselin et al .",
    "this type of asymmetry might arise in part from anisotropies in the outflowing wind and/or density gradients in the surrounding ism ( see vigelius et al .",
    "2007 ) . as the  emission branches off to the north",
    ", it roughly follows a ridge of bright fuv knots ( part of what m07 term the `` north stream '' ) , before bifurcating into two lobes .",
    "a few additional isolated clumps of  are also visible to the north .",
    "all of the  emission detected from mira with the vla overlaps with the fuv light seen by _ galex _ , although the detailed relationship between the two tracers is unclear .",
    "is seen concentrated along the western side of the tail where the fuv emission is also the brightest .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the fuv tail shows no  counterpart , including the bow shock , the southeastern edge of the tail , and the fuv - bright region lying between mira and the bow shock ( termed the `` south stream '' by m07 ) .",
    "moreover , on smaller scales there is no obvious correlation between the observed column density of the  emission and the surface brightness of the fuv emission .",
    "detection of h@xmath38 emission from the uv - bright knots by m07 suggests that most of the gas at these locations is likely to be partially ionized . in the case of the south stream , given that this region has a different fuv@xmath17nuv color than the rest of the tail , the medium here may be very highly ionized , and that the fuv emission from this location may have a different origin ( e.g. , hot plasma emission ) .",
    "individual  channel maps from our vla imaging observations are shown in figure  [ fig : cmaps ] .",
    "we find that near the position of the star , the emission detected in the central velocity maps ( 44.3 - 47.5  ) has a larger spatial extent than in the outer velocity channels , as would be expected for an expanding envelope . at the same time , several of the channels show additional emission extending toward the north that arises from the near - tail .",
    "the velocity field of the latter component appears complex , suggesting that the small - scale motions of the tail gas may be affected by turbulence .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the tail as a turbulent wake ( e.g. , wareing et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : totalspectra ] shows the global  spectrum of mira derived from the vla observations .",
    "the spectrum shown as a thick black line was derived from the `` tapered '' data cube ( table  2 ) by summing all emission within a @xmath39(e - w)@xmath40@xmath41(n - s ) box centered at @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "uncertainties on the total flux densities in each channel are @xmath440.01  jy . the vla  profile agrees well with the nrt line profile derived toward mira and is discussed further in   [ globsum ] .",
    "the 21-cm continuum emission within a 30@xmath10 region surrounding mira comprises a number of weak point sources with a total observed flux density of @xmath60.4  jy ( uncorrected for primary beam attenuation ) .",
    "mira  ab itself is undetected , and we detect no continuum emission coincident with any of the bright knots seen in the uv and in h@xmath38 by m07 . the brightest continuum source in the region lies at @xmath45 , @xmath46  @xmath47 , and we measure for it a flux density of 0.228@xmath210.003  jy ( after correction for the primary beam ) .",
    "it overlaps with the fuv emission detected by _ galex _ , but lies outside the region where  was detected in emission with the vla .",
    "we have examined a spectrum toward this source and detect a weak ( @xmath63@xmath31 ) absorption feature ( figure  [ fig : mira_absorb ] ) .",
    "based on a gaussian fit , this feature has a peak flux density @xmath48  mjy , a fwhm of @xmath490.9  , and a central velocity @xmath500.9  .",
    "both the central velocity and the width of the line feature are consistent with the  gas observed in the tail of mira in emission ( see figures  [ fig : totalspectra ] and [ fig : nancay ] ) .",
    "detection of  in absorption in the tail of mira allows us to obtain a constraint on the spin temperature of the gas . for the `` robust + 1 '' data , the limiting  column density for a detection of  in _ emission",
    "_ , integrated over a gaussian line profile with fwhm 7.1  , is @xmath51  @xmath52 ( 3@xmath31 ) . under the assumption that the absorbing gas at the position of the continuum source has an equal or lower column density than gas detected in emission",
    ", one may then write : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin temperature of the atomic hydrogen and @xmath55 is its optical depth ( e.g. , dickey et al .",
    "the assumption of a gaussian line shape yields a line - integrated optical depth for the absorption profile of @xmath560.20 , and therefore @xmath5737  k. clumping of the absorbing material would further reduce this limit , implying that a component of the tail gas is rather cool .",
    "to achieve greater sensitivity to extended , low surface brightness  emission in the vicinity of mira , we made observations at several positions along its tail with the nrt ( see table  3 ) .",
    "our pointings were selected using the _ galex _ map from m07 as a guide .",
    "these observations were obtained between 2007 september and 2007 december as part of a target of opportunity program .",
    "the nrt is a meridian - transit - type telescope with an effective collecting area of roughly 4000  m@xmath58 . at 1420 mhz , its half - power beam width is @xmath59 in right ascension and 22@xmath10 in declination for a source at the declination of mira ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "typical system temperatures are @xmath635  k. further properties of the nrt are described in van driel et al .",
    "the large collecting area of the nrt and the good match between the n - s extension of the beam and the direction of mira s wake make the nrt well - suited to searching for extended , low column density material .    our observational strategy for mapping the tail consisted of position - switched measurements at each pointing , with beam - throws of @xmath61 or @xmath62 in the e - w direction .",
    "one - third of the time was devoted to the on - position and two - thirds of the time to the off - source comparison spectra .",
    "a full nrt spectrum has a bandwidth of 165  and a spectral resolution of 0.08  .",
    "a total of 44 hours of data were obtained along the tail .",
    "fortunately , there is minimal galactic  emission near the lsr velocity of mira ; this provides flat baselines that permit us to detect weak signals efficiently .",
    "data processing was performed using the class software and consisted of subtracting a linear baseline from each spectrum before averaging .",
    "the results of our nrt mapping are summarized in table  3 , and we show a sampling of our spectra in figure  [ fig : nancay ] .",
    "we have clearly detected  emission from mira s tail as far as @xmath1 north of the star .",

    "however , whereas the co linewidths directly gauge the expansion velocity of the stellar wind , the  profile width may be affected by turbulent motions in the tail gas (   [ turbu ] ) or by possible thermal broadening ( libert et al .",

    "furthermore , the tail age approaches the expected interval between two thermal pulses ; the relatively modest change in surface brightness over the length of mira s tail then suggests that the predicted growth in the mass - loss rate for agb stars between thermal pulses ( e.g. , vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) may be smaller than previously assumed .      adopting the mass - loss rate for mira derived from co observations ( @xmath81 yr@xmath66 ; ryde & schier 2001 ) and assuming this mass - loss rate has remained constant in time",
    ", the age derived in   [ age ] implies that the total mass of mira s circumstellar debris should be @xmath82 .",
    "after adjusting our current  measurements for the mass of he , we then estimate that neutral atomic material accounts for @xmath625% of mira s circumstellar envelope and tail .",
    "we now briefly comment on some possible implications of this finding .",
    "previous observations have shown that mira s wind is likely to be predominantly molecular as it leaves the star ( e.g. , bowers & knapp 1988 ; josselin et al .",
    "2000 ; wood et al .",
    "however , as discussed by josselin et al . , the bulk of mira s circumstellar material is expected to be dissociated by the interstellar radiation field at radii of @xmath83  cm from the star . therefore , unless the wind is very clumpy ( thereby increasing the survival time of the molecules ) , it is expected that atomic matter will comprise a significant fraction of the material that is ultimately swept by ram pressure into the tail .    under the assumption",
    "that the fuv light from mira s tail arises entirely from collisional excitation of h@xmath8 by hot electrons ( m07 ) , an expected by - product will be rapid dissociation of molecules ( see also raymond et al .",
    "1997 ) , thus providing an additional atomic contribution to mira s tail .",
    "indeed , the dissociation rate of @xmath84  s@xmath66 assumed by m07 should have produced roughly a factor of four more h atoms during the past @xmath85  years than we observe .",
    "assuming some fraction of the wind is atomic before being swept into the tail , this raises some difficulty in how to maintain a sufficient supply of h@xmath8 to power mira s fuv luminosity over its inferred lifetime . a significantly lower molecular dissociation rate ( @xmath610% ) could help resolve this problem ; however such a rate approaches that expected from the interstellar radiation field alone ( morris & jura 1983 ) .",
    "if a portion of the material in mira s tail is clumpy , self - shielding of the molecular hydrogen could also help to increase its lifetime ( see , e.g. , huggins et al .",
    "a search for co emission associated with such a clumped component in mira s tail would be of considerable interest .",
    "an alternative explanation may be that some fraction of the fuv light from mira s tail arises from processes involving atomic material , such as the h two - photon continuum ( e.g. , dodorico et al .",
    "1980 ) and/or bremsstrahlung emission from a hot ( @xmath86  k ) `` surface '' of the tail .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations and modelling should help to clarify these issues .",
    "we have reported the detection of an extended tail of neutral , atomic hydrogen associated with the agb star mira .",
    "this  21-cm line emission arising from the tail coincides with the fuv - luminous wake recently discovered by m07 .",
    "although mira is currently the only known star to have a fuv - bright tail , we draw attention to the possibility that its  tail may represent an extreme example of a rather common phenomenon for evolved stars undergoing mass - loss .    grard & le  bertre ( 2006 ) already reported evidence that emission associated with circumstellar envelopes may be offset from the position of the central star .",
    "in addition , matthews & reid ( 2007 ) previously reported the detection of an  `` plume '' stretching @xmath60.2  pc from the semi - regular variable star rs  cnc .",
    "we have since confirmed that the geometry of this plume is consistent with material trailing the motion of rs  cnc through the ism .",
    "more recently , we have imaged an analogous , but somewhat shorter tail associated with another semi - regular variable star , x  her ( gardan et al . 2006",

    "both of these stars have smaller space velocities than mira ( @xmath618  and @xmath6100  , respectively ) , indicating that unusually high space motion is not a prerequisite for tail formation ; indeed , it may require only that the stellar space velocity exceeds the expansion velocity of the wind .",
    "while the sample of stars imaged in  is presently small , evidence of interaction between the circumstellar envelope and the ism has also been seen in the global  spectra of a number of -detected stars ( e.g. , grard & le  bertre 2006 and references therein ) . observed  line profile shapes are frequently inconsistent with a classic spherically symmetric model of mass - loss at a constant outflow speed , and may show velocity centroids offset from those observed in co. as shown by gardan et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , these profiles can be well reproduced once the effects of ism interaction are accounted for .",

    "_ we therefore propose that extended gaseous tails may be ubiquitous features of evolved stars undergoing mass - loss . _ for stars with low space velocities , hot companions , and/or largely atomic winds , these tails may lack associated bow shock structures and/or a detectable fuv counterpart , but should in many instances be readily detectable via   21-cm line observations .",
    "the conditions for detection of these tails will be most favorable for stars at high galactic latitudes and/or with systemic velocities well removed from those of the bulk of the galactic emission .",
