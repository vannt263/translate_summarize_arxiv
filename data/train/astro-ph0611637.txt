    "the widespread existence of metals outside of galaxies has been known for a decade ( e.g. , cowie et al .",

    "it has since become clear that this enrichment is related to many other aspects of physical cosmology , and that the question of  how did the intergalactic medium become enriched ?",
    "\" has a number of components that we would like to understand . among them :    * the low - density ( @xmath1 ) intergalactic medium ( igm ) , as probed by the ly@xmath2  forest and through c@xmath3iii , c@xmath3iv , si@xmath3iii , si@xmath3iv , o@xmath3v , o@xmath3vi , and other transitions , is at least partly enriched at all redshifts and densities probed  .",
    "how did these metals get where they are ? * the intracluster medium is highy enriched to @xmath4 , with most metals produced in clusters residing in the intracluster medium rather than in the galaxies themselves  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". how did such efficient metal ejection occur ?",
    "* semi - analytic and numerical models of galaxy formation overpredict the stellar masses of ( in particular small ) galaxies unless they incorporate significant feedback such as would drive material from galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what is the relation between enrichment and galaxy formation ?",
    "* the @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 ) mass - metallicity relation is indicative of loss of metals by galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how much baryonic mass and metal mass is ejected by galaxies as they form ? * some galaxies at @xmath7  @xcite , and nearly all galaxies at @xmath8  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are observed to drive winds that might escape .",
    "do they escape ?",
    "what is their impact ?    in connection with these facts , a general picture has emerged that galactic winds  driven largely from young and/or starburst galaxies  have enriched the igm both within clusters and the general field .",
    "the same feedback may account for the dearth of low - luminosity galaxies ( relative to the halo mass function ) , and also the mass - metallicity relationship of galaxies .",
    "however , a detailed understanding of the various feedback processes is lacking , and there are still open questions , and controversies , concerning the time at which various components of enrichment occurred , exactly how , and what this tells us about galaxy formation .",
    "the rest of this article will review recent progress in piecing together this picture .",
    "first we schematically review the physics behind outflows , the basic ways of assessing the predictions of these for the observed intergalactic ( ig ) enrichment , and what general predictions seem to be agreed - upon .",
    "we then discuss how the metallicity of the low - density igm is measured , and the basic results obtained using these techniques .",
    "finally , we discuss what is probably the best way to get a true handle on the enrichment mechanism : direct comparison between detailed feedback simulations and the large data sets now becoming available .",
    "while a single supernova explosion can not blow material out of any but the smallest galaxy , a large set of contemporaneous and co - spatial explosions might . in this case , the overlap of super - heated bubbles can overlap and merge into a ",
    "superbubble \" that blows out of the galaxy and forms an outflowing large - scale wind  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a common way to model this has been to assume that the superbubble will form a  supershell \" for which equations of motion can be evolved that include the driving pressure , gravity , the ram pressure of the medium encountered , etc .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if the shell fragments ( as is expected ) , another shell might form , and the evolution can be followed by encompassing repeated shell - fragmentation in the form of an  entrainment fraction \" specifying how much of the ambient material must be carried by the outflow along with the superheated gas .",
    "a second basic mechanism has more recently been proposed by  @xcite , in which it is momentum deposition by radiation pressure ( coupled via dust to the gas ) , or cosmic ray pressure  @xcite , that drives the outflow .",
    "these two possible mechanisms may coexist and would both result in a rather complicated outflow structure . a first - order model of the effect of these outflows on the host galaxy and the nearby igm",
    "can , however , be generated by assuming that whatever the outflow does at very small radii , it eventually organizes into a wind with some mass outflow rate @xmath9 , velocity @xmath10 , and entrainment fraction , and does so in such a way as to conserve some quantity ( energy or momentum ) .",
    "the two mechanisms differ in the suggested relation between , in particular , @xmath11 and @xmath10 . for energy driven winds , it has been argued that @xmath10 should be roughly independent of the progenitor galaxy mass  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "then if the feedback efficiency is also fixed , equating the energy generation to the energy carried by the wind indicates that : @xmath12    for winds driven by radiation pressure , it is more natural for both the wind speed and outflow rate to depend on the progenitor galaxy mass ( or velocity dispersion @xmath13 ) , giving a wind possible wind prescription at large radii of  @xcite : @xmath14 with the wind momentum outflow @xmath15 equated to a fixed fraction of the momentum input ( i.e. luminosity ) of the source",
    ".    while these are two interesting perspectives to take , a very great deal happens between an erg of energy ( or g cm / s of momentum ) being deposited , and the wind several kpc away .",
    "in particular , while energy and momentum are certainly conserved in these systems , winds may radiate much of their energy and much of the momentum may cancel out if , as in starbursts , it is generated by a distribution of sources .",
    "that being said , suppose we have some prescription for the wind parameters as a function of galaxy properties .",
    "how might we make predictions for intergalactic enrichment ?",
    "two basic approaches are used in making predictions for ig enrichment from a given wind model : the semi - analytic , and the numerical .",
    "semi - analytic approaches  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) generally proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "a cosmological simulation is used to determine galaxy locations , halo masses , and gravitational potentials .",
    "2 .   the simulations outputs themselves ( for hydrodynamic simulations ) or",
    "semi - analytic prescriptions overlaid on the halos ( for dark matter simulations ) are used to determine galaxy star - formation rates , metallicities , gas properties , inflow rates , etc .",
    "a prescription based on a simplified wind model is applied to the galaxy properties to determine how far a wind would propagate during a  time step \" and how the expelled metals would be distributed .",
    "these metals are then  painted on \" to the gas or dark particles .",
    "the metallicity of particles is then tracked , to yield the metallicity distribution at later cosmological epochs .    in the numerical approach  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one instead :    1",
    ".   directly simulates gas physics anew for each trial .",
    "2 .   uses prescriptions for star formation , feedback of both energy and metals into the gas surrounding star - forming regions , and possibly for the launching of winds .",
    "3 .   tracks metals accumulating in the gas particles , and potentially uses these metallicities in the cooling rates of the gas .",
    "relative to the numerical method , the primary advantage of the semi - analytic method is speed : many realizations can be computed on a desktop computer in the time that one simulation can be run on a supercomputer . another advantage is that semi - analytic methods allow a clearer connection to be made between the physical ingredients of the model and the results , possibly leading to a better understanding of the actual physics that is responsible for particular effects .",
    "numerical methods , in contrast , treat the gas physics _ much _ more accurately and can , for example , assess the impact of feedback on the thermal state of the gas .",
    "depending on the resolving power of the simulations , fewer prescriptions for physics need to be used than in the semi - analytic method , since the physics can be directly simulated .",
    "simulations naturally allow a self - consistent treatment of the effect of feedback on star formation .",
    "finally , they easily allow for the generation of mock observations .",
    "there is a fairly large literature on ig metals using both approaches , so we here focus on what appear to be general and ( fairly ) well - agreed upon findings :    * galaxies at @xmath8 essentially all drive winds : whether winds are launched  automatically \" or via a prescription , if the mechanism is consistent with winds from low-@xmath0 starbust galaxies , then it will also predict that most high-@xmath0 galaxies drive them , since the specific sfrs are so much higher then . *",
    "wind propagation and escape is quite sensitive to the entrainment fraction and to @xmath16 .",
    "this occurs because the two primary forces limiting wind propagation are the galaxy s potential well ( if the wind speed is not much higher than the escape velocity ) and the ram pressure of the ( potentially infalling ) gas that must be swept up even if the wind is fast .",
    "moreover , if entrainment is significant , then the mass over which the wind energy and momentum must be shared may be much greater .",
    "* the metallicity of the igm resulting from enrichment by galactic winds is highly inhomogeneous and probably has a filling factor @xmath17 . *",
    "higher - redshift enrichment tends to lead to more homogeneous enrichment at lower - redshift .",
    "this is somewhat contentious and depends in detail on the assumptions made , but appears to be borne out by numerical calculations .",
    "it occurs because high-@xmath0 galaxies are relatively smaller and more numerous , and because the winds have more time to propagate .",
    "it appears to occur in spite of the fact that the earliest galaxies of any given mass tend to form in highly biased and highly - clustered regions .",
    "* there is a strong correlation between the gas metallicity and the gas density , which follows simply from the fact that galaxies form preferentially in high - density regions .",
    "the numerical treatments of ig enrichment reinforce many of these conclusions .",
    "in addition they seem to generically suggest that :    * a significant fraction of the metals ejected end up in hot ( @xmath18k ) gas , especially when metal - line cooling is not included , but also even when it is . * except at the highest redshifts and with the smallest sources , winds tend to preferentially propagate outside and in - between filaments , and also have a low filling factor , so that there is little overall disruption of the structure or statistical description of the ly@xmath2 forest itself .",
    "nearly everything we know about the enrichment of the igm at @xmath19 is via optical c@xmath3iv , c@xmath3iii , si@xmath3iv , si@xmath3iii , o@xmath3v , and o@xmath3viabsorption - line spectroscopy of distant quasars .",
    "below we briefly review how these assessments are performed , and the basic results obtained to date .",
    "the standard technique is to fit line profiles to a set of absorption features to derive ( where the line is not too saturated ) column densities and ( where the line is resolved ) line - widths .",
    "this technique works well in the igm for relatively high - column lines where there is relatively little contamination .",
    "given extremely good data , this can probe gas densities at only a few times the cosmic mean  @xcite .",
    "once determined , the ionic column densities can might be converted into metallicities as described below .",
    "the prime advantages of line - fitting over the pixel - based techniques described next are that it ( a ) is familiar and straightforwardly interpreted , ( b ) treats high column - density lines well , and ( c ) gives information on line widths .",
    "its main disadvantages are that it ( a ) is unsuitable for statistical searches for absorption that is weak compared with the noise or contamination ; ( b ) is subjective in the sense that decompositions in voigt profiles are non - unique ; ( c ) is slow and dependent on prior identification of lines , making it unsuitable for application to large datasets and simulations .    the pixel optical depth ( pod )",
    "method   is a complementary approach that has certain advantages , particularly when applied to weak , widespread absorption that may be easily confused with contaminating lines or when applied to large date sets or simulations .",
    "the key steps in the pod search are :    1 .   compute arrays of apparent pixel optical depths , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the transmitted flux in the pixel and the local continuum , respectively .",
    "sophisticated methods have been developed  @xcite to correct for contamination , noise , continuum fitting errors , etc . in these ",
    "apparent \" optical depths , taking advantage of the fact that many ions generate multiplets ( e.g. , h@xmath3i ) or doublets ( e.g. , c@xmath3iv , n@xmath3v , o@xmath3vi , and si@xmath3iv ) , with known optical depth ratios .",
    "2 .   choose a `` base '' and a `` target '' transition and bin the pixel pairs according to the recovered pod of the former ( e.g. , c@xmath3iv  as a function of h@xmath3i ) .",
    "the combinations that have so far proved to be most useful are c@xmath3iv(h@xmath3i )  @xcite , o@xmath3vi(h@xmath3i )  @xcite , si@xmath3iv(c@xmath3iv )  @xcite , c@xmath3iii(c@xmath3iv )  @xcite , and si@xmath3iii(si@xmath3iv )  @xcite .",
    "3 .   compute the median ( or any other percentile ) of the target transition pod as a function of the binned base transition pod .",
    "a correlation reflects a detection .",
    "the method can be generalized to measure the full distribution of target optical depths by simultaneously measuring multiple percentiles  @xcite .",
    "while elemental abundances are desired , we can only measure ion abundances , whether from optical depth ratios or column density ratios .",
    "this is unfortunate in that uncertainties in the ionization balance are currently the limiting factor in the study of intergalactic abundances .",
    "but it is also good news , because it means that we can constrain the physical conditions in the gas , since the ionization balance depends in general on the radiation field , the gas density , and the gas temperature .",
    "the radiation field ( if uniform ) , can be described in terms of a normalization ( in the form of the h@xmath3i  ionization rate ) and a spectral shape ( determined by the type of sources , and the transfer of radiation through the igm ) .",
    "the uv background ( uvb ) models of  @xcite have become fairly standard , ( which is not to say they may not be quite incorrect ! ) and provide a useful benchmark .    in photo - ionization equilibrium ,",
    "the gas density is closely related to the h@xmath3i  optical depth : @xmath23 , and the h@xmath3i  ionization rate @xmath24 can be measured .",
    "a similar ( but more detailed ) relation can be obtained using mock spectra drawn from hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "this relation can be used both to perform ionization corrections , and to indicate the density of gas being probed .",
    "if the gas is very hot and/or dense , then collisional ionization may dominate over photo - ionization , in which case the ionization balance will depend only on the temperature .",
    "if photo - ionization dominates , then the ion fractions are still weakly dependent on the temperature because the recombination rates are .",
    "however , as long as @xmath25 , as is usually assumed , the temperature is not the main source of uncertainty in the analysis .      using the spectral data and ionization - correction modeling just discussed , in the past decade or so we have assembled a reasonably detailed assessment of ig enrichment  albeit with some large outstanding questions .",
    "basic results thus far include :    * the carbon abundance ( probed via c@xmath3iv ) is inhomogeneous : at fixed overdensity @xmath26 and redshift @xmath0 , the p.d.f . for [ c / h ]",
    "is a gaussian of width @xmath270.5 - 1.0 dex , i.e. the distribution is lognormal  @xcite .",
    "similar results hold for oxygen as probed via o@xmath3vi  @xcite . * the median carbon abundance [ c / h ] ( and also the width of the p.d.f . )",
    "increases with density  @xcite , and there is ( some ) carbon in ( some ) underdense gas ( corresponding to @xmath28 )  @xcite . * for a standard choice of the uv background ( hm01 q+g uvb ) , the median [ c / h ] does not evolve from @xmath29 to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "in addition , metals exist at @xmath30  @xcite . *",
    "the igm is alpha - enhanced relative to the sun : [ si / c ] @xmath31  @xcite , [ o / c ] @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this suggests enrichment by predominantly type ii supernovae , perhaps even with a contribution by hypernovae  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and other contributions to this volume ) .",
    "* results are uvb - dependent .",
    "a @xcite uvb model with galaxies and quasar light included , and 10% escape fraction from galaxies seems plausible ; a much harder or softer does uvb does not  @xcite * using detected si@xmath3iii  and c@xmath3iii  absorption , it can be shown that most strong si@xmath3iv  and c@xmath3iv  absorption arises in photoionized gas  @xcite . * metals are correlated with themselves and with galaxies @xcite .",
    "a basic implication of the above findings is that essentially all of the results are explainable by metals `` sprinkled '' onto simulations with no winds , at @xmath33 . but",
    "does it mean that _ all _ metals in the igm come from such an early enrichment period ?",
    "there are some reasons to think not .",
    "first , a substantial fraction of all metals generated by stars at @xmath34 appear to reside in the diffuse igm : [ c / h ] @xmath35 , [ si / h ] @xmath36 , [ o / h ] @xmath37 ( for hm01 q+g ) imply @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "second , because their ionization fractions fall quickly with temperature above @xmath39k , c@xmath3iv  and si@xmath3iv  can not probe very hot gas  metals in such gas would simply be invisible to probes using these ions .    in general , the _",
    "rough _ amount of metals present in the igm can be reproduced by models that include galactic winds ( though not with models that do not include winds ) . however , the observations summarized above present a detailed and challenging target for the next generation of models . in the next section",
    "we summarize some recent work comparing cosmological simulations  including enrichment  in detail to the observed spectra .",
    "while much can be inferred using observations directly , it is very useful to compare them to synthetic spectra generated from simulations with enrichment  including the effect of the outflows on the igm . in one investigation of this sort ,",
    "@xcite analyzed two sets of high - resolution particle - pased hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite with different feedback prescriptions that both drive strong winds at @xmath40 as per the late enrichment scenario .",
    "four general and qualitative conclusions of this study were as follows .",
    "first , the feedback simulations produce far too small values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for all uvb models employed .",
    "second , metal - rich gas in the simulations is too hot and too low - density : essentially all of the intergalactic and enriched gas in both simulations exists in low - density , high - temperature ( @xmath43 ) bubbles .",
    "since both the c@xmath3iv / c ratio and the c@xmath3iii / c@xmath3iv  ratio fall off quickly with both increasing temperature @xmath44k and decreasing density @xmath45 , the gas becomes nearly invisible in c@xmath3iv , and where c@xmath3iv  is detected there is virtually no accompanying c@xmath3iii .",
    "third , metal line cooling , which was not included , should be important . if crudely modeled ( by assuming that gas cools to @xmath46k if its cooling time is shorter than the hubble time ) , much more c@xmath3ivabsorption is present and the _ median _ @xmath47 could plausibly match the observed one .",
    "finally , metals nonetheless appear too low - density and too inhomogeneous : while including metal cooling might lead to a sufficient increase in c@xmath3iv  absorption , it does _ not _ appear to fix the difficulty in reproducing c@xmath3iii / c@xmath3iv .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the metal - rich gas has too low density to produce the observed ratios .",
    "this problem may also be lessened by a proper treatment of metal cooling , as the cooling would also affect the gas dynamics , allowing gas to contract as it cools .",
    "but there is yet another problem , which is that although the _ median _ @xmath48 can be roughly reproduced by the simulations , the spread in @xmath49 at a given @xmath50 can not : the metals in the simulations are _",
    "too inhomogeneous_. this problem seems unlikely to improve from a correct treatment of metal cooling .    in a more recent study ,  @xcite",
    "have compared simulated spectra from a large suite of feedback simulations to observed line and pixel data .",
    "( see also contributions by dav and oppenheimer in the present volume for more details ; here we just mention a few points . )",
    "the oppenheimer & dav simulations include metal - line cooling , and wind prescriptions chosen to correspond to  momentum driven \" and  energy driven \" winds as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - models ] . in comparison to  @xcite",
    "there are two findings of note .",
    "first , dav et al .",
    "find much better agreement in c@xmath3iv / h@xmath3i  and c@xmath3iii / c@xmath3iv  optical depth ratios between their simulations and the data than do  @xcite .",
    "this is very likely due to the inclusion of metal line cooling .",
    "second , in models for which the c@xmath3ivoptical depths are compatible with observations , the overall cosmic carbon abundance is higher than that inferred by  @xcite based on the same data",
    ". this indicates that ( as argued by dav et al . )",
    "metals are being hidden in relatively hot gas not probed by the observations",
    ".    it would be very interesting to see how the dav et al .",
    "simulations fare when applied to o@xmath3vi , which is much more sensitive to the presence of hot gas , and when applied to percentiles in c@xmath3iv  other than the median  which  @xcite found difficult to reproduce using simulations , even with cooling included .",
    "we will conclude with some facts , and some opinions .",
    "the key facts are :    * both observations and simulations of ig enrichment are getting drastically better , and the former are , finally , strongly constraining the latter .",
    "* comparisons between observations and simulations have to be done with care .",
    "* observations of ig metals strongly constrain models of feedback from star formation ( a crucial ingredient of simulations and galaxy formation models ) .      *",
    "enrichment is unlikely to be purely `` contemporary '' or `` primordial '' : enrichment almost surely occurs at @xmath51 , perhaps mostly hidden in hot gas .",
    "however , it is unclear that @xmath52 enrichment can account for all measurements . *",
    "it seems likely that a galaxy - mass - dependent @xmath10 is necessary  but it is not clear that this requires radiation - pressure - driven winds .",
    "* there is a dearth of high - quality , high - resolution simulations of individual wind - driving galaxies in a cosmological background .",
