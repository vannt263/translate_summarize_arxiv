    "there is the classical weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath3 , which gives a local conformal parametrization for any minimal surface .",
    "it involves choosing two holomorphic functions ( or perhaps meromorphic functions when considering the surfaces more globally ) on a riemann surface .",
    "if one restricts to isothermic parametrizations , that is , conformal parametrizations that are also curvature lines coordinate systems , then the representation reduces to the choice of just one holomorphic function .",
    "since every minimal surface has local isothermic coordinates ( away from umbilics ) , this reduction does not involve any loss of generality beyond avoiding umbilic points .",
    "once one restricts to isothermic parametrizations , it becomes possible to give a definition for discrete analogs of minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "these analogs are `` discrete isothermic '' meshes ( a definition of this is given later in this paper ) .",
    "they are comprized of planar quadrilaterals , which in particular have concircular vertices .    by a transformation called the lawson correspondence or @xmath4-transformation or calapso transformation @xcite",
    ", one can produce all constant mean curvature ( cmc ) @xmath2 surfaces in hyperbolic @xmath0-space @xmath1 from minimal surfaces in @xmath3 .",
    "there is a corresponding holomorphic representation for those surfaces as well , first given by bryant @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , without loss of generality beyond avoiding umbilics , one can restrict to isothermic coordinates in this case also , and one has a discrete analog of cmc @xmath2 surfaces in @xmath1 , first found by hertrich - jeromin @xcite .    in the case of smooth surfaces",
    "there is also a holomorphic representation for flat ( i.e. intrinsic curvature zero ) surfaces in @xmath1 @xcite and this also ties in to the above - mentioned bryant representation , as there are deformations from cmc @xmath2 surfaces in @xmath1 to flat surfaces via a family of linear weingarten surfaces in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these do not include all linear weingarten surfaces , but rather a certain special subclass called linear weingarten surfaces of _ bryant type _",
    "@xcite @xcite , so named because they have bryant - type representations .",
    "thus it is natural to wonder if flat surfaces also have a discrete analog , and we will see here that they do .",
    "once this discrete analog is found , a new question about `` singularities on discrete flat surfaces '' naturally presents itself , in this way : unlike the smooth isothermic minimal surfaces in @xmath3 and cmc @xmath2 surfaces in @xmath1 , smooth flat fronts have certain types of singularities , such as cuspidal edges and swallowtails ( in fact , indirectly , this is what the naming `` fronts ''  rather than `` surfaces ''  indicates ) .",
    "the means for recognizing where the singularities are on smooth flat fronts are clear , and one can make classifications of those surfaces most generic types of singularities just from looking at the choices of holomorphic functions used in their representation @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of discrete flat surfaces , it is not apriori clear where the singularities are , nor even what such a notion would mean . since one does not have first and second fundamental forms at one s disposal in the discrete case",
    ", one must find an alternate way of defining singularities .",
    "we aim towards this by defining and using a discrete analog of caustics , also called focal surfaces , for smooth flat fronts . for a smooth flat front",
    ", the caustic is the surface comprised of all the singular points on all parallel surfaces of that flat front .",
    "( the parallel surfaces are also flat . )",
    "thus the singular set of the flat front can be retrieved by taking its intersection with its caustic . in the case of a smooth flat front ,",
    "the caustic is again a flat surface , but this will not quite be the case for discrete flat surfaces .    we will also present a number of examples of these discrete flat surfaces .",
    "in addition to the rather simple examples of discrete cylinders and discrete surfaces of revolution , we will also discuss a discrete flat surface based on the airy equation .",
    "this example exhibits swallowtail singularities and a stokes phenomenon , similar to that of the analogous surface in the smooth case , as shown by two of the authors in @xcite .",
    "this last example hints at existence of a robust collection of discrete flat surfaces with interesting geometric properties yet to be explored .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to :    1 .   provide a definition for discrete flat surfaces and discrete linear weingarten surfaces of bryant type in hyperbolic @xmath0-space @xmath1 ; 2 .   give properties of these surfaces that justify our choice of definitions ( in particular , as smooth flat fronts have extrinsic curvature @xmath2",
    ", we identify notions of discrete extrinsic curvature of discrete flat surfaces which do indeed attain the value @xmath2 ) ; 3 .",
    "show that these surfaces have concircular quadrilaterals ; 4 .",
    "study examples of these surfaces , and in particular look at swallowtail singularities and global properties of an example related to the airy equation ; 5 .",
    "give a definition of discrete caustics for discrete flat surfaces ; 6 .",
    "show that the caustics also have concircular quadrilaterals and that they provide a means for identifying a notion of singularities on discrete flat surfaces .    in section [ section1 ]",
    "we describe smooth and discrete minimal surfaces in euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath3 , to help motivate later definitions , and we also give the definition of a discrete holomorphic function , which will be essential to everything that follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we describe smooth cmc @xmath2 surfaces , and flat surfaces and linear weingarten surfaces of bryant type in @xmath1 , again as motivational material for the definitions of the corresponding discrete surfaces in section [ section3 ] .",
    "we prove in section [ section3 ] that discrete flat surfaces and linear weingarten surfaces of bryant type have concircular quadrilaterals .",
    "also , section [ section3 ] provides a natural representation for discrete flat surfaces which gives the mapping of the surfaces as products of @xmath5 by @xmath5 matrices times their conjugate transposes , and we show that this representation applies to the case of discrete cmc @xmath2 surfaces as well . the definition for discrete cmc @xmath2 surfaces is already known @xcite , but the representation here for those surfaces is new . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we look at a specific discrete example whose smooth analog is equivalent to solutions of the airy equation , and we look at the asymptotic behavior of that surface , which exhibits swallowtail singularities and a stokes phenomenon . in section [ section5 ] , we look at normal lines to discrete flat surfaces . with this",
    "we can do several things . for example , we look at parallel surfaces ( which are also discrete flat ) and show that the area of corresponding quadrilaterals of the normal map equals the area of the quadrilaterals of the surface itself , as should be expected , since in some sense the extrinsic curvature of the surface is identically equal to @xmath2 ( note that the analogous statement is true for smooth surfaces with extrinsic curvature @xmath2 , infinitesimally ) . then , using distances from the surface s vertices to the intersection points of the normal lines , we consider a discrete analog of the extrinsic curvature and see that it is @xmath2 in the discrete case as well .",
    "furthermore , those intersections give us a means to define discrete caustics , and , as mentioned above , we use those caustics to study the nature of `` singularities '' on discrete flat surfaces , in the final section [ section6 ] .",
    "the authors thank udo hertrich - jeromin for fruitful discussions and valuable comments .",
    "a useful choice of coordinates for a surface is isothermic coordinates .",
    "not all surfaces have such coordinates , but cmc surfaces in space forms such as @xmath3 and @xmath1 do have them , away from umbilic points .",
    "isothermic coordinates will be of central importance in this paper .",
    "another useful tool in the study of surfaces in space forms is the hopf differential , which is defined as @xmath6 , where the surface @xmath7 is a map from points @xmath8 in a portion of the complex plane @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the bilinear extension of the metric for the ambient space form to complex vectors , and @xmath11 is the unit normal to the surface . when the coordinate @xmath8 is conformal and the surface is cmc , then @xmath12 will be holomorphic in @xmath8 .",
    "umbilic points of the surface occur precisely at the zeros of the hopf differential .      locally , away from umbilics",
    ", we can always take a smooth minimal immersion @xmath13 into @xmath3 to have isothermic coordinates @xmath14 in a domain of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the unit normal vector to @xmath7 . then , setting @xmath16 , the hopf differential becomes @xmath17 for some real constant @xmath18 , and rescaling the coordinate @xmath8 , we may assume @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the stereographic projection of the gauss map @xmath11 to the complex plane , and set @xmath21 .",
    "as we are only concerned with the local behavior of the surface , and we are allowed to replace the surface with any rigid motion of it , we may ignore the possibility that @xmath20 has poles or other singularities , and so the map @xmath22 is holomorphic . because we avoid umbilic points of @xmath7",
    ", we also know that @xmath23 is never zero . thus the weierstrass representation is ( with @xmath24 regarded as lying in the complex plane @xmath9 ) @xmath25 associating @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the quaternions @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , we have @xmath32 we have converted to a formulation using quaternions here , because this type of formulation has been used to define discrete minimal surfaces in @xmath3 and discrete cmc @xmath2 surfaces in @xmath1 , and we wish to make comparisons to those formulations .",
    "note that by restricting to isothermic coordinates , we can then determine minimal surfaces by choosing just one holomorphic function @xmath20 .      to define discrete minimal surfaces , we use discrete holomorphic functions @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the square integer lattice @xmath35 , or a subdomain of it .",
    "discrete holomorphic functions are defined as follows : defining the cross ratio of @xmath20 to be @xmath36 we say that @xmath20 is _ discrete holomorphic _ if there exists a discrete mapping @xmath37 to @xmath38 such that @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all quadrilaterals ( squares with edge length @xmath2 and vertices in @xmath34 . ) see @xcite .",
    "we call the discrete map @xmath37 a _ cross ratio factorizing function _ for @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is defined on edges of @xmath34 , not vertices .",
    "note also that @xmath37 is symmetric , that is , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "there is a freedom of a single real factor in the choice of these @xmath44 and @xmath45 , since we could replace all of them with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for any nonzero real constant @xmath48 , and all relevant properties would still hold . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath48 to denote that free factor .    in the above definition of the cross ratio",
    ", we have a product of four terms .",
    "since @xmath49 , these terms all commute , and so we could have written this cross ratio simply as a product of two fractions . however , when we later consider the cross ratio for quaternionic - valued objects or matrix - valued objects , commutativity no longer holds and the order of the product in the cross ratio becomes vital .",
    "so , for later reference , we have chosen to write the cross ratio in the somewhat cumbersome way above .",
    "the definition above for discrete holomorphic functions is in the `` broad '' sense .",
    "the definition in the `` narrow '' sense would be that @xmath50 is identically @xmath51 on @xmath34 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , note that , unlike the case of smooth holomorphic functions , the discrete derivative or discrete integral of a discrete holomorphic function is generally not another discrete holomorphic function .",
    "let us exhibit some examples of discrete holomorphic functions :    1 .",
    "let @xmath52 , and set @xmath53 for @xmath54 a complex constant .",
    "2 .   let @xmath55 , and set @xmath56 for @xmath54 a real or pure imaginary constant .",
    "one could also take the function @xmath57 for choices of real constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 so that the cross ratio is identically @xmath51 , giving a discrete holomorphic function in the narrow sense .",
    "[ item5 ] in section [ section4 ] we will describe a discrete flat surface based on a discrete version of the power function @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , which we define here . this function is discrete holomorphic in the narrow sense .",
    "it is defined by the recursion @xmath62 we start with @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    ", the initial conditions should be @xmath65 we can then use to propagate along the positive axes @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "we can then compute general @xmath70 ( for both @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) by using that the cross ratio is always @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath70 will then automatically satisfy the recursion relation .",
    "this definition of the discrete power function can be found in bobenko @xcite .",
    "( it is also found in a recently published textbook @xcite . )",
    "agafonov @xcite showed that these discrete power functions are embedded in wedges ( see figure [ fct43 ] ) , and are schramm circle packings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the pochhammer symbol , and a closed expression for general @xmath70 is still unknown .",
    "we explore this difference equation in more detail in appendix [ appendix ] at the end of this paper .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",

    "however , it has a number of interesting properties closely related to discrete flat surfaces , which we will describe .",
    "the first property is stated in this lemma :    [ lem6pt6 ] the quadrilaterals of @xmath130 lie in geodesic planes of @xmath1 .",
    "this is clear from the geometry of the construction , and from the fact that adjacent normal geodesics always lie in a common geodesic plane of @xmath1 , by lemma [ single - caustic - lemma ] .",

    "since the extrinsic curvature @xmath138 is exactly @xmath2 , if @xmath139 , we have @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and we have that @xmath142 this last right - hand equality , of course , is clear from the fact that @xmath143",
    ". however , the right - hand equality encodes that the extrinsic curvature is exactly @xmath2 in a way that can be applied to the discrete case , as follows : the corresponding equation in the discrete case is given by the corresponding summation about the four edges ( assume @xmath144 and @xmath145  the other case can be handled similarly ) latexmath:[\\[\\label{artanhguydiscrete } \\text{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{-\\lambda \\alpha_{pq}+    + |g_q - g_p|^2}\\right ) - \\text{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda \\alpha_{qr}+     + |g_s - g_r|^2}\\right ) - \\text{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda \\alpha_{sp}+    quadrilateral with vertices associated to @xmath126 ( given in counterclockwise order about the quadrilateral in @xmath34 ) in the discrete surface .",
    "the analogous geometric meaning of @xmath147 is preserved in the discrete case , as it is the inverse of the ( oriented ) distance from either @xmath87 or @xmath89 to the intersection point of the geodesics in @xmath117 stemming off of @xmath87 and @xmath89 in the directions of @xmath86 and @xmath118 , respectively ( see remark [ single - caustic - lemma - but - in - r31 ] ) .",
