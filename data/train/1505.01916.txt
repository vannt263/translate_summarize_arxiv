    "if we release the impact angle of the first rod , the speed of the rebound ball does not remain as a simple function of the angular speed of the hitting rod .",
    "we showed that the speed of the rebound ball is different even though the angular velocities of the second rod at the contact time are same .",
    "furthermore , considering the whole stroke , the maximum angular velocity for the lower speed of the rebound ball is greater than the maximum angular velocity for the higher speed of the rebound ball . therefore , to get maximum speed of the rebound ball , it s not sufficient to set the condition to generate high angular velocity of the hitting racket .",

    "if we simply hold the racket for a short time without enforcing a torque and with subsequent application of torque , the naive intuition estimates decrease in the speed of the rebound ball .",
