    "observation reveals that some simple gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with well - separated structure consist of fundamental pulses which are seen to comprise a fast rise and an exponential decay ( fred ) phases ( see , e.g. , fishman et al .",
    "the fred pulses together with the hardness - intensity correlation were interpreted as signatures of the relativistic curvature effect ( the doppler effect over the fireball surface ) ( fenimore et al . 1996 ; ryde and petrosian 2002 ; kocevski et al . 2003 ; qin et al . 2004 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "accounting for the great output rate of radiation of grbs , a fireball model was proposed as early as in 1980s ( goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ) , and based on it , the shifting of the spectrum or the boosting of the radiation of the objects and other phenomena , due to the doppler effect over the fireball surface , could be expected ( see , e.g. , krolik and pier 1991 ; meszaros and rees 1998 ; hailey et al .",
    "1999 ; qin 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "one could find from the batse data that fred pulse light curves of grbs in different energy channels differ significantly in the magnitude and the width of the curves .",
    "however , from these light curves a self - similarity across energy bands could be observed ( see , e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the past few years , many attempts of interpretation of the light curves observed have been made ( see , e.g. , fenimore et al . 1996 ; norris et al . 1996",
    "; norris et al . 2000 ; ryde and petrosian 2002 ; kocevski et al . 2003 ) . statistical analysis based on the fit to the light curve revealed that the temporal scale factors of a given pulse measured at different energies are related to the corresponding energies by a power law ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ; norris et al . 1996",
    "; nemiroff 2000 ) , which was suspected to result from a relative projected speed or a relative beaming angle ( nemiroff 2000 ) .",
    "paper i shows that the power law relationship between the pulse width and energy as a consequence of the doppler effect over the fireball surface is due to different active areas of the fireball surface corresponding to the majority of photons of the channels observed .",
    "an investigation on the relationship was performed in detail previously and based on it the expected behavior of the relationship in the swift band was presented ( see qin 2004 ) . however , the width of pulses reflects only one aspect of the light curves . generally , for a certain event ,",
    "if only a relationship is observed , one might find several mechanisms accounting for it ; however , when several relationships are observed , the number of interpretation might be fewer or even unique .",
    "it is understood that , generally , the more relationships observed , the few number of possible interpretations .",
    "therefore , to have the model completely checked or to sufficiently understand how different channel light curves are related , other quantities rather than the pulse width such as the magnitude or the total count should also be studied .    shown in fig .",
    "10 of paper i are the light curves of the four batse channels of grb 951019 , where the fitting curves of the four channels share the same formula with the same parameters , differing only in the energy integral range . in this analysis ,",
    "no parameters other than the energy ranges are allowed to vary with the energy channel concerned .",
    "however , even with this figure , the following question can not easily be answered : for the same count rate of a channel measured at different times , what would happen to the count rates of other channels measured at these times ?",
    "this suggests that , to show the relation between different channel light curves , figures other than this one might also be at work and might work better in some particular aspects .    in the following",
    ", we will study in detail the relation between different channel light curves with some quantities other than the width , and based on the analysis predictions on the behavior of the corresponding relationships in the swift band will be made .",
    "through out this paper , the relation between different channel light curves of grb pulses is studied under the assumption that the sources concerned are in the stage of fireballs which expand relativistically and isotropically . here",
    "we study how some characters of light curves are related with the corresponding energy .",
    "the width of pulses is a well - known character of light curves determined by energy channels .",
    "let us consider two other quantities which are also characters of light curves associated with the corresponding channels .",
    "one is the peak count rate and the other is the total count .",
    "the distributions of these two quantities for both long and short grbs were investigated previously ( mcbreen et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) . here",
    ", we pay our attention to the relations of these quantities with energy .",
    "the formula for calculating the count rate of a fireball source is ( a1 ) ( see appendix a ) . in this paper , we consider only the cases of local gaussian pulse ( a2 ) and local power law pulse ( a3 ) ( see appendix a ) . two kinds of fireball bursts are concerned .",
    "one is a typical hard burst with @xmath10 and the other is a typical soft burst with @xmath8 and they are assumed to share the same rest frame radiation spectrum and the same local pulse ( see qin 2004 ) . it is known that the peak energy @xmath11 could serve as a quantity describing the hardness of the spectrum of a burst observed ( see ford et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the case of a rest frame band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , when adopting @xmath14 we find that the typical hard burst has a peak energy at @xmath15 and the typical soft burst is associated with @xmath16 ( see qin 2002 table 4 ) .      here",
    "we adopt a typical band function spectrum with @xmath12 and @xmath17 as the rest frame radiation form to study the relation in a general manner .",
    "the swift telescope payload is comprised of three instruments .",
    "two of them can detect high energy photons with one ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 and the other from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/ ) . here",
    "we study the relation within a wide band ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23 which covers both the swift and batse bands .",
    "it should be noticed that , unlike the width of pulses , the peak and total count depend strongly on the interval of energy .",
    "we thus consider the following uniformly ranging channels ( where @xmath24 ) : @xmath25=[0.2,0.4]kev$ ] ( channel a ) , @xmath26kev$ ] ( channel b ) , @xmath27kev$ ] ( channel c ) , @xmath28kev$ ] ( channel d ) , @xmath29kev$ ] ( channel e ) , @xmath30kev$ ] ( channel f ) , @xmath31kev$ ] ( channel g ) , @xmath32kev$ ] ( channel h ) , @xmath33kev$ ] ( channel i ) , @xmath34kev$ ] ( channel j ) , and @xmath35kev$ ] ( channel k ) .",
    "note that , channel h is just the second channel of barse .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "1 are the light curves of all these channels for the typical hard and soft bursts , where we adopt the local gaussian pulse with @xmath36 and assign @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we find in the figure that while the profile of light curves is much less affected by the lorentz factor , in agreement with what revealed in paper i , the relative magnitudes and hence the relative total counts of different channel light curves depend strongly on the latter .",
    "listed in table 1 are the peak count rate *  * @xmath39 and the total count *  * @xmath2 of these channels associated with different local pulse forms and widthes for the typical hard and soft bursts , presented in the format relative to the corresponding values of channel h. ( note that the absolute values would make sense only when all the constants concerned such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are available . ) it shows that relative values of these quantities depend obviously on the energy concerned as well as the adopted lorentz factor , but they are less affected by the width and form of local pulses .",
    "relations between the peak count rate and energy and the total count and energy associated with these channels in the case of adopting the local gaussian pulse with @xmath43 for the typical hard and soft bursts are displayed in fig .",
    "2 . shown in the figure , there exist semi - power law relationships between the peak count rate and energy and between the total count and energy for both the typical hard and soft bursts .",
    "the power law range for the hard burst covers the batse band while that for the soft burst spans over a much wider band , indicating that one could observe the power law relationship for the soft burst but not the hard burst in the swift band .",
    "it seems that , for a bursts , the total count of a channel is proportional to the corresponding peak count rate . shown in fig",
    "3 are the relation between the two quantities for the typical hard and soft bursts in the case of adopting the local gaussian pulse with @xmath44 .",
    "a semi - power law relationship between the two quantities is observed for both bursts , where the power law index for the hard burst is @xmath45 and that for the soft one is @xmath46 .",
    "one might observe that , when adopting the channels defined above , some counts such as those within @xmath47kev$ ] would be missed .",
    "following the way that the batse team adopted , one can simply consider channels not uniformly ranged but includes all the counts observed . here , we consider another set of channels which are similar to the previous ones but include all counts .",
    "they are @xmath25=[0.2,0.5]kev$ ] ( channel aa ) , @xmath26kev$ ] ( channel b ) , @xmath48kev$ ] ( channel c ) , @xmath49kev$ ] ( channel da ) , @xmath29kev$ ] ( channel e ) , @xmath50kev$ ] ( channel f ) , @xmath51kev$ ] ( channel ga ) , @xmath52kev$ ] ( channel h ) , @xmath53kev$ ] ( channel ia ) , and @xmath54kev$ ] ( channel kb ) , where , the last four channels are just the batse channels . comparing this set of channels with the previous set , one would find that channels aa , da , ga , ia , and kb span over larger energy ranges than the corresponding channels a , d , g , i , and k do , respectively .",
    "presented in table 2 are the relative peak count rate and the relative total count of channels aa , da , ga , ia , and kb arising from the local gaussian pulse with different values of width for the typical hard and soft bursts .",
    "it shows that , due to the larger energy ranges , the two quantities of channels aa , da , ga , ia , and kb are significantly larger than that of the corresponding channels a , d , g , i , and k , respectively",
    ". relations between the peak count rate and energy and the total count and energy deduced from channels aa , da , ga , ia , and kb in the case of the local gaussian pulse with @xmath55 for the typical hard and soft bursts are also displayed in fig .",
    "2 . we find in the figure that the peak count rate and the total count of the channels with larger energy ranges are obviously larger than those of the smaller energy range channels , and the two quantities of the former channels form by themselves continuous relationships with energy , which are different from the relationships deduced from the smaller energy range channels .",
    "the relation between the peak count rate and total count of channels aa , da , ga , ia , and kb arising from the local gaussian pulse with @xmath56 for the typical hard and soft bursts is also shown in fig .",
    "the two quantities follow almost the same power law relationships deduced from the uniformly ranging channels ( channels a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , and k ) .",
    "one could observe from tables 1 and 2 that the pulse form and width do not significantly affect the relative values of the peak count rate and total count , while the lorentz factor does .",
    "this suggests that , when performing a statistical analysis on the relationships discussed above , the distribution of the lorentz factor would play an important role .",
    "we wonder if the rest frame radiation form would also be an important factor in producing the relationships .",
    "let us study the relation in the cases of other rest frame radiation forms , where only the case of the local gaussian pulse with @xmath56 is considered .",
    "presented in tables 3 and 4 ( see appendix b ) are the relative values of the peak count rate and total count of the light curves of various channels in the case of local gaussian pulses with @xmath44 for two rest frame band function spectra @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we find that the impacts of the rest frame radiation form on the two quantities are very significant . displayed in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are the relationships between the two quantities and energy for the two rest frame band function spectra , respectively .",
    "we find that , for a relatively steep rest frame spectrum , there is a turnover in the relationships between the peak count rate and energy and between the total count and energy , and the relationship between the peak count rate and the total count exhibits a hook - like curve ( see fig .",
    "4 ) ; for a relatively flat rest frame spectrum , the power law relationships between the peak count rate and energy and between the total count and energy would extend to the lower energy range of the swift band , and the relationship between the peak count rate and the total count is a well - defined power law ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "from these figures one can conclude that the values of *  * @xmath1 and @xmath59 depend obviously on the rest frame radiation form and the lorentz factor .",
    "besides the band function , two other rest frame spectra are considered .",
    "one is the thermal synchrotron spectrum which is written in the form @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 is a constant which includes all constants in the exponential index ( liang et al .",
    "the other is the comptonized spectrum which is written as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .",
    "typical value @xmath65 ( schaefer et al . 1994 ) for the index of the comptonized radiation will be adopted .",
    "corresponding to the typical hard and soft bursts , we take @xmath66 in the case of the rest frame thermal synchrotron spectrum ( see qin 2002 table 3 ) , and take @xmath67 in the case of the rest frame comptonized spectrum ( see qin 2002 table 2 ) .",
    "relative values of the two quantities associated with various channels for these two rest frame spectra are presented in tables 5 and 6 ( see appendix b ) , respectively .",
    "the values span several orders of magnitudes .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "6 are the relationships between the two quantities and energy for the rest frame thermal synchrotron spectrum , which is similar to fig . 4 where a steep form of spectra is adopted .",
    "the most obvious difference exhibits in the relationships between the peak count rate and energy and between the total count and energy associated with the typical soft burst , where the turnover is hardly detectable .",
    "the figure for the rest frame comptonized spectrum is quite similar to fig .",
    "6 and therefore is omitted .",
    "let us study the relation under the assumption that the rest frame radiation form varies with time ( this phenomenon is common in observation ) .",
    "with the 95 bursts fitted with the band function in preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , one could find that the low and high energy power law indexes , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , of the sources develop in the way @xmath70 and @xmath71 in terms of statistics ( see qin 2004 ) .",
    "we therefore consider an evolution of the rest frame indexes @xmath72 and @xmath73 following @xmath74 and @xmath75 . here , the relation will be studied in the case of adopting the local gaussian pulse with @xmath44 .",
    "we thus use @xmath76 to replace @xmath77 in these two relations . in the same way , we take @xmath14 and assign @xmath10 to the hard burst and @xmath8 to the soft one .",
    "associated with the decreasing of the indexes , we ignore the rising portion of the local pulse and assign for the local gaussian pulse that @xmath78 and @xmath37 . listed in table 7 ( see appendix b ) are the relative values of the peak count rate and total count of the light curves of various channels in the case of local gaussian pulses with @xmath55 for the rest frame varying band function spectrum .",
    "the values also span several orders of magnitudes .",
    "the figure showing the relationships between the two quantities and energy for the rest frame varying band function spectrum is also similar to fig .",
    "4 ( it is therefore omitted ) , suggesting that , creating the relation between different channel light curves , the rest frame varying band function acts like a steep form of rest frame spectra .",
    "in this section we make a direct comparison between count rates of different channel light curves , which may reveal other aspects of the relation between them .",
    "all channels discussed above will be concerned .      here",
    "we consider a rest frame band function spectrum with @xmath12 and @xmath79 .",
    "presented in fig .",
    "7 are the curves of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 deduced from the light curves of fig.1 , where @xmath4 is the count rate of channel h. this figure would be able to tell if the rising or decaying speeds of the light curves of different channels are the same .",
    "we find that , generally , the speeds are not the same , and for each channel , the rising and decaying parts of @xmath3 in the figure constitute a close curve . for the typical soft burst",
    ", the speed of rising or decaying of the count rate of higher energy bands is the same for different channels while the speed in lower energy bands varies significantly .",
    "corresponding to a certain value of the count rate of channel h , there are two values of the count rate of lower energy channels , where the one associated with the rising portion of the light curve is larger than the one associated with the decaying phase .",
    "this bi - valued character can also be seen in the case of the typical hard burst , where for higher energy channels the one associated with the rising portion of the light curve is smaller than the one associated with the decaying phase .",
    "besides the peak count rate discussed above , there are two characters of the close curves in fig .",
    "one is the maximum value of the deviation of the two values of the count rate of a channel corresponding to a certain value of that of channel h. the other is the area confined by each close curve in the figure .",
    "we define the maximum deviation of the two count rates of a channel corresponding to a certain count rate of channel h as @xmath80 when @xmath81 is maximum , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the count rates of the rising portion and decaying phase of the light curve , respectively , and @xmath84  is the peak count rate of channel h. in addition , we define an area @xmath7 confined by the close curve as the area under the rising portion curve minus that under the decaying phase curve in the plot of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 , where all count rates are normalized to @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "according to their definition , the values of both @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be positive or negative .",
    "presented in table 8 are the values of @xmath85 and @xmath7 associated with different channel light curves in the case of local gaussian pulses with various values of @xmath86 for the rest frame band function spectrum with @xmath87 and @xmath79 .",
    "we find that to determine these two quantities the lorentz factor plays an important role while the width of local pulses does not .",
    "displayed in fig .",
    "8 are the relationships between @xmath5 and energy , and between @xmath7 and energy , and between @xmath5 and @xmath7 themselves .",
    "it shows that , generally , both @xmath5 and @xmath7 increase with the increasing of energy , and in the relationships between @xmath5 and @xmath88 and between @xmath89 and @xmath88 , a turnover will be observed in the case of the typical hard burst and a platform will be seen in the case of the typical soft burst in a higher energy range .",
    "the two quantities are linearly correlated .",
    "the slope for the typical hard burst is @xmath90 while that for the typical soft burst is @xmath91 .",
    "the cases of other rest frame spectra discussed above are studied here , including : two rest frame band function spectra with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ; the thermal synchrotron spectrum @xmath94 $ ] ; the comptonized spectrum @xmath95 ; and a varying band function with its indexes changing following @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we will take the same parameters adopted above to calculate the two quantities @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "listed in tables 9 - 13 ( see appendix b ) are the values of @xmath5 and @xmath89 calculated in the case of the local gaussian pulse with @xmath36 , adopting these rest frame spectra .",
    "it shows that , to produce @xmath5 and @xmath7 , the lorentz factor plays an important role .",
    "it is interesting that , for the typical soft burst the values of @xmath5 and @xmath7 span over one order of magnitudes , while for the typical hard burst they vary mildly .",
    "this suggests that , for a certain radiation form , the ranges of @xmath5 and @xmath89 are sensitive to the lorentz factor . shown in figs .",
    "9 - 13 are the relationship between @xmath5 and energy associated with these rest frame spectra ( the relationship between @xmath7 and energy is not presented in these figures due to the similarity to the relationship between @xmath5 and energy ) .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath7 is almost the same for different cases discussed here and therefore the corresponding figures are omitted . for a relatively flat rest frame spectrum , @xmath5 increases with energy , where a platform in the high energy range can be observed ( see fig .",
    "the platform shifts to lower energy bands when the lorentz factor becomes smaller . for a relatively steep rest frame spectrum ,",
    "@xmath5 decreases with energy in lower bands while increases in higher bands . for the typical soft burst ,",
    "there is a platform in the higher bands , while for the typical hard burst , the platform is replaced by a convex curve ( see fig .",
    "9 ) . exhibited in the relationship ,",
    "the behavior of the rest frame thermal synchrotron , comptonized and the varying band function spectra is similar to that of the rest frame steep spectrum ( see figs . 9 and 11 - 13 ) .",
    "the values of the two quantities rely obviously on the rest frame radiation form .",
    "in this paper , the relation between different channel light curves of grb pulses is studied in aspects other than the width of pulses . the peak count rate *  * @xmath1 and the total count *  * @xmath2 are employed . to make a direct comparison between count rates of different channel light curves we introduce a plot of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 , where @xmath98 is the count rate of a channel and @xmath4 is the count rate of channel h. according to the plot we define @xmath5 as the maximum deviation of the two count rate values of @xmath3 associated with a same count rate value of @xmath4 and define @xmath7 as the area confined by the close curve of @xmath3 in the plot to measure the difference of the rising and decaying portions of a light curve relative to the count rate of channel h. predictions on the four quantities *  * @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath99 , and @xmath7 within the swift band , calculated with different rest frame radiation forms and two typical lorentz factors ,",
    "are made and presented ( see the tables ) , which would make the test of our model with the coming swift data easier .    as shown in fig .",
    "7 , a positive value of @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) suggests that the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the rising portion of @xmath3 is generally larger than that in the decaying phase , and a negative value of @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) means the opposite .",
    "the analysis shows that the four quantities *  * @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath99 , and @xmath7 depend obviously on energy .",

    "@xmath1 and @xmath59 decrease with energy ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "as the radiation form is not significantly affected by the doppler effect of fireballs ( see qin 2002 ) , we suspect that this trend might be a consequence of the relatively large amount of rest frame low energy photons which shift to x - ray or low gamma - ray bands . in the case of a relatively steep rest frame spectrum",
    ", there is a turnover in the relationship between @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) and energy ( see figs . 4 and 6 ) .",
    "this might be caused by the position of the peak energy @xmath11 of the observed spectrum .",
    "as the spectrum is steep , the number of both higher and lower energy photons must be relatively small , and the peak count rate would be observed in the channel around @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , we find in figs . 4 and 6 that the turnover appears in higher energy band when the lorentz factor is large ( note that @xmath100 ; see , e.g. , qin 2002 ) .    shown in figs . 9 - 13",
    "we find that the value of @xmath5 is negative in low energy bands .",
    "this suggests that , compared with those of channel h , both the increasing speed of the low energy photon number in the rising phase and the decreasing speed of the number in the decaying phase are smaller . we regard this as a consequence of the expanding fireball , where high energy photons mainly come from the small area close to the line of sight and hence the number of the photons increases rapidly while low energy photons come from both the small area close to the line of sight and most of the rest area of the fireball surface and hence the number of the photons increases slowly , and for the same reason the number of high energy photons decreases rapidly while the number of low energy photons decreases slowly in the decaying phase",

    "<S> the @xmath0 width is a well known quantity representing the characteristics of pulses of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , for which many studies were presented . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are some other elements which can describe other aspects of the pulses that the width can not . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the peak count rate *  * @xmath1 and the total count @xmath2 of light curves to study in the corresponding aspects the relationship between different channel light curves . to make a direct comparison between count rates of different channel light curves we introduce a plot of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the count rate of a channel and @xmath4 is the count rate of a definite cannel , channel h ( see the text ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to the plot we define @xmath5 as the maximum deviation of the two count rate values of @xmath3 associated with a same count rate value of @xmath6 and define @xmath7 as the area confined by the close curve of @xmath3 in the plot to measure the difference of the rising and decaying portions of a light curve relative to the count rate of channel h. under the assumption that some grbs observed are in the stage of fireballs which expand relativistically , predictions on the relationships between the four quantities *  ( * @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 ) and energy within a wide band , calculated with different rest frame radiation forms and two typical lorentz factors ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , are made and presented , which would make the test of our model with the coming swift data easier . </S>",
    "<S> interpretations to the relationships within the mechanism of fireballs are also presented . </S>"
