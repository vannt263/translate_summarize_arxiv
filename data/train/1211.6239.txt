    "mobile data traffic is anticipated to grow many - fold between 2010 and 2020 , inducing many technical challenges such as how to improve energy efficiency in order to limit growth in energy consumption to a factor smaller than that of data traffic growth .",
    "the drive to make cellular networks more `` green '' starts with base stations ( bss ) , since they make up a large proportion of the total energy consumed in any cellular network @xcite .",
    "cell planning , i.e. placement of bss and coverage area of each one , is usually based on estimated static ( e.g. peak ) traffic load .",
    "current research in cellular network planning mainly focus on the practical deployment algorithm design .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors used stochastic geometry to analyze the optimal macro / micro bs density for energy - efficient heterogeneous cellular networks with qos constraints .",
    "the energy efficiency of heterogeneous networks and the effects of cell size on cell energy efficiency were investigated in @xcite by introducing a new concept called area energy efficiency .",
    "however , traffic load in cellular networks fluctuates substantially over both space and time due to mobility and traffic burstiness .",
    "therefore , there will always be some cells under light load , and others under heavy load , which suggests that static cell planning based on peak load will not be optimal .",
    "load balancing schemes have thus been proposed in both academia and industry @xcite , which react to load variations across time and cells by adaptively re - allocating users to cells . in @xcite ,",
    "a network - wide utility maximization problem was considered to jointly optimize partial frequency reuse and load - balancing in a multicell network . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed the `` cell breathing '' technique , which shrinks ( or expands ) the coverage of congested ( or under - loaded ) cells by reducing ( or raising ) the power level , so that the load becomes more balanced .",
    "bss consume a significant amount of energy ( up to @xmath0 of the total network energy consumption @xcite ) due to their operational units , e.g. , processing circuits , air conditioner , besides radio transmission .",
    "therefore , selectively letting some bss be switched off according to traffic load can yield substantial energy saving .",
    "there have been a few bs on - off switching schemes introduced in the literature .",
    "for example , energy saving as a function of the daily traffic pattern , i.e the traffic intensity as a function of time , was derived in @xcite , where it is shown through simulations that energy saving on the order of @xmath1 is possible .",
    "centralized and distributed bs reconfiguration algorithms were proposed in @xcite , with simulations showing that the centralized algorithm outperforms the distributed one at the cost of increased complexity and overhead . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a wireless local area network ( wlan ) consisting of a high density of access points ( aps ) .",
    "the resource on - demand ( rod ) strategy was introduced to power on or off wlan aps dynamically , based on the volume and location of user demand .    when some bss are switched off ,",
    "their coverage areas need to be served by the remaining active bss in the network .",
    "such a self - organized network ( son ) has been introduced in 3gpp lte @xcite .",
    "a similar but more flexible method called `` cell zooming '' was proposed in @xcite , which adaptively adjusts the cell size according to traffic load , user requirements , and channel conditions , in order to balance the traffic load in the network and thereby reduce energy consumption .",
    "energy - efficient cellular network planning with consideration of bss ability of cell zooming , which is characterized as cell zooming ratio , was investigated in @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , a scheme that adapts both coverage range and transmit power ( including the possibility of turning off the bs ) to minimize the total energy consumed has not been studied in the literature , even under the simple one - cell setup .",
    "this motivates our work , which studies the extreme case of one single - cell system in order to obtain useful insights that could be applied in a general multi - cell environment .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the downlink transmission in an orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) based cellular network .",
    "unlike traditional cellular networks using fixed time and/or bandwidth allocation , we consider that the available time - frequency transmission blocks are dynamically and equally allocated to a random number of active mobile users ( mus ) .",
    "moreover , the bs is assumed to have two levels of power control : short - term power control ( stpc ) and long - term power control ( ltpc ) , which correspond to the inherent difference in the time scales of the mus average channel gain variations ( in e.g. seconds ) and traffic density variations ( in e.g. hours ) .",
    "stpc sets the transmit power based on each mu s distance from the bs to meet each mu s outage probability requirement over fading , while ltpc ( including bs on - off control ) is implemented according to traffic density variations such that the long - term energy consumption at the bs is minimized under a certain system - level throughput constraint . under the above broadcast channel setup , a new power scaling law , which relates the ( short - term ) average transmit power of bs with the given cell coverage range and traffic density ,",
    "is derived for the case of homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) distributed mu locations .",
    "based on the derived power scaling law , we determine the optimal long - term cell adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and ltpc problem . since it is challenging to obtain closed - form expressions for the optimal policy , approximate solutions are derived in closed - form under a high spectrum efficiency ( hse ) assumption , which provide further insights into the design of cellular networks of the future in which both power and spectral efficiency are important .    by identifying that the energy saving at bs essentially comes from two major energy saving mechanisms ( esms ) , i.e. range adaptation and bs on - off power control , we propose low - complexity suboptimal schemes with various combinations of the two esms to further investigate their effects on the system energy consumption . by numerical simulations",
    ", it is shown that significant energy saving can be achieved in ofdma broadcast channels with the optimal cell adaptation policy .",
    "furthermore , it is revealed that when the network throughput requirement is modest , the simple bs on - off control is nearly optimal for cell adaptation in terms of energy saving ; however , when higher network throughput is required , a finer - grained strategy of range adaptation is needed .",
    "these results provide useful guidelines for designing energy - efficient cellular networks via cell power and/or range adaptations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] introduces the system model , and derives the bs power scaling law under stpc .",
    "section [ sec : optimal power and range adaptation ] studies the joint cell range adaptation and ltpc problem . section [ sec : suboptimal ] presents various low - complexity suboptimal schemes .",
    "section [ sec : performance comparison ] compares the performance of optimal and suboptimal schemes through numerical examples .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an ofdma downlink in one particular cell with bandwidth @xmath2 hz .",
    "it is assumed that the bs can adaptively adjust its cell coverage according to mu density and power budget through admission control . in this section ,",
    "we first introduce a spatial model of cellular traffic based on mus distributed according to a hppp .",
    "then , we elaborate on the proposed bandwidth sharing scheme for the ofdma - based broadcast channel . finally , we describe the stpc , based on which a power scaling law relating the ( short - term ) average transmit power at a bs given a pair of coverage range and mu density is derived .",
    "the two - dimensional poisson process has been used to model the locations of mus in a cellular network . in this paper , we assume that mus form a hppp @xmath3 of density @xmath4 in the euclidean plane . considering that every mu within the cell coverage requests connection ( voice service or data application ) randomly and independently with probability @xmath5 , then according to the marking theorem @xcite , the active mus ( that need to communicate with a bs ) form another hppp @xmath6 of density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . since we are interested in active mus , we refer to active mus simply as mus in the rest of this paper . the mu density @xmath7",

    "the available time - frequency resource is divided into resource blocks ( rbs ) over both time and frequency , which are allocated among mus such that each mu can be ideally assigned an effective bandwidth with arbitrary value from @xmath18 to @xmath2 hz .",
    "note that in general , dbs allocates the available rbs dynamically among mus in order to optimize certain system - level utility ( e.g. throughput ) based on the number of mus , their channels from the bs , and their qos requirements .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , in this paper we assume a simplified equal bandwidth sharing ( ebs ) scheme among mus , i.e. , the effective bandwidth allocated to mu @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is @xmath21 hz .",
    "an illustration of the ebs within a scheduled transmission frame @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbs ] .",
    "the available time - frequency resource is divided into rbs with dimensions @xmath23 and @xmath24 over time and frequency , respectively . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are assumed to be much smaller than the channel coherence time , @xmath25 , and the channel coherence bandwidth , @xmath26 , respectively ; thus a flat - fading channel can be assumed in each rb .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the number of frequency slices and time slices , respectively , within a transmission frame .",
    "the total number of available rbs within one frame can be computed as @xmath29 , which is assumed to be large enough such that each mu can be assigned a continuous effective bandwidth @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of rbs allocated to mu @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath19 is therefore @xmath33 , over a period of @xmath34 channel uses , where a channel use corresponds to @xmath23 seconds .",
    "therefore , mu @xmath19 is given @xmath35 hertz of bandwidth per channel use , which also implies that the bs is serving @xmath36 active mus by ebs .",
    "with ebs , the achievable rate for mu @xmath19 , given received signal power @xmath37 , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 accounts for the gap from the channel capacity due to a practical coding and modulation scheme , and @xmath40 is the power spectral density of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "suppose that channel coding is performed over @xmath41 non - contiguous rbs allocated to a mu ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : dbs ] with @xmath42 ) .",

    "we assume a simplified channel model consisting of distance - dependent pathloss with path loss exponent @xmath48 and an additional random term accounting for short - term fading of the channel from the bs to each mu . with the assumed channel model , the received signal power for the @xmath46th rb of mu @xmath19",

    "<S> improving energy efficiency is key to network providers maintaining profit levels and an acceptable carbon footprint in the face of rapidly increasing data traffic in cellular networks in the coming years . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - saving concept studied in this paper is the adaptation of a base station s ( bs s ) transmit power levels and coverage area according to channel conditions and traffic load . </S>",
    "<S> cell coverage is usually pre - designed based on the estimated static ( e.g. peak ) traffic load . </S>",
    "<S> however , traffic load in cellular networks exhibits significant fluctuations in both space and time , which can be exploited , through cell range adaptation , for energy saving . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we design short- and long - term bs power control ( stpc and ltpc respectively ) policies for the ofdma - based downlink of a single - cell system , where bandwidth is dynamically and equally shared among a random number of mobile users ( mus ) . </S>",
    "<S> stpc is a function of all mus channel gains that maintains the required user - level quality of service ( qos ) , while ltpc ( including bs on - off control ) is a function of traffic density that minimizes the long - term energy consumption at the bs under a minimum throughput constraint . </S>",
    "<S> we first develop a power scaling law that relates the ( short - term ) average transmit power at bs with the given cell range and mu density . </S>",
    "<S> based on this result , we derive the optimal ( long - term ) transmit adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and ltpc problem . by identifying the fact that energy saving at bs essentially comes from two major energy saving mechanisms ( esms ) , i.e. range adaptation and bs on - off power control , we propose low - complexity suboptimal schemes with various combinations of the two esms to investigate their impacts on system energy consumption . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that when the network throughput is low , bs on - off power control is the most effective esm , while when the network throughput is higher , range adaptation becomes more effective .    </S>",
