    "the method of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) first proposed by @xcite allows us to derive source positions with nanoradian precision ( 1 nrad @xmath1 0.2  mas ) . since 1971",
    "when the first catalogue of source coordinates determined with vlbi was published @xcite , the number of extragalactic compact radio sources which positions were derived using vlbi under absolute astrometry observing programs grew from 35 objects to 7215 in 2012 . for 95% these sources , accuracies of their positions are in a range of 0.05 to 6.5  mas with the median 0.5  mas .",
    "these sources form a dense grid on the sky that can be used for many applications , such as differential astrometry , phase - referencing vlbi observations of weak objects , space navigation , earth orientation parameter determination , and space geodesy .",
    "however , high accuracy of positions of these objects can be exploited _ directly _ only by applications that utilize the vlbi technique .",
    "applications that use different observational techniques can benefit from the high accuracy of vlbi positions only _ indirectly _ by observing common objects from the vlbi catalogue with instruments at other wavelengths .",
    "the european space agency space - born astrometry mission _ gaia _ , scheduled to be launched in 2013 , according to @xcite promises to reach sub - mas accuracies of determining positions of quasars of 1620 magnitude that will rival accuracies of absolute astrometry vlbi . since position catalogues produced with _ gaia _  and vlbi will be completely independent , their mutual rotations , zonal differences and possibly other systematic effects can be interpreted as errors of one of the techniques after resolving the differences due to a misalignment of centers of optic and radio images of quasars and a frequency - dependent core - shift @xcite .",
    "investigation of systematic differences will be very important for the assessment of the overall quality of _ gaia_results and , possibly , the errors in the vlbi position catalogue .",
    "this comparison will produce valuable results if 1 )  it will be limited to those common sources which vlbi positions are known with errors smaller than several tenths of a milliarcsecond ; 2 )  the number of sources will be large enough to derive meaningful statistics ; and 3 )  the sources will be uniformly distributed over the sky .",
    "however , the number of quasars that have a compact core and are bright in both optical and radio wavelengths , and therefore , can be detected with both techniques , currently is rather limited .",
    "the observing program for densification of the list of such objects was launched in 2006 @xcite with the eventual goal of deriving highly accurate position of sufficiently radio - loud quasars from vlbi observations in the absolute astrometry mode .",
    "the original observing sample consisted of 447 optically bright , relatively weak extragalactic radio sources with declinations above @xmath2 .",
    "the detailed observing scheme of this project is presented in @xcite .",
    "the first vlbi observing campaign in 2007 resulted in detection of 398 targets with the european vlbi network ( evn ) @xcite , although no attempt to derive their positions or produce images was made . during the second observing campaign a subset of 105 sources detected in the previous campaign",
    "was observed with the global vlbi network that comprises the vlba and evn observing stations with the goal of revealing their morphology on milliarcsecond scales from vlbi images @xcite for consecutive screening the objects with structure that potentially may cause non - negligible systematic position errors .",
    "their positions were derived by @xcite and formed the obrs1 catalogue .    in 20102011 remaining 290 sources",
    "have been observed in the third campaign , hereafter called obrs-2 , with the global network that comprises the vlba and evn observing stations in a mode similar to the second campaign .",
    "i present here results of data analysis of this observations . observations and their analysis are described in sections [ s : obs ] and [ s : anal ] .",
    "the position catalogue is presented in section [ s : cat ] and discussed in section [ s : discussion ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ s : summ ] .",
    "during obrs2 campaign there were three observing sessions with 10 vlba stations and 56 evn stations from this list : eflsberg , medicina , onsala60 , yebes40 m , dss63 , hartrao , noto .",
    "first four evn stations participated in every experiment , three remaining stations participated in some experiments .",
    "each program source was observed in one session , in 34 scans , each 5 minutes long .",
    "two sources , 1148@xmath3387 and 1203@xmath3109 , were observed in two sessions in 5 scans .",
    "in addition to 290 program sources , 8 strong calibrators were observed .",
    ".summary of observing sessions [ cols= \" < , < , < , > \" , ]     the positions of 295 sources observed in obrs2 experiment are listed in table  [ t : cat ] .",

    "this approach is an alternative to the strategy adopted for obrs project .",
    "analysis of the second dual - band s / x vlba campaign of the program for observing optically bright extragalactic radio sources allowed me to determine positions of 295 target sources and make images of 285 of them . because of using the frequency setup unfavorable for absolute astrometry , the position uncertainties ranged from 2 to 200  mas with the median value of 3.2  mas .",
