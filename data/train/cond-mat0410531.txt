    "much attention has recently been devoted to the problem of utilizing electron spin in semiconductor electronics .",
    "an overview of this evolving subject of spintronics is given in ref .  .",
    "one central aim of these efforts is the ( preferably ) electrical generation , manipulation , and detection of spin currents .",
    "while a large part of spintronics related literature is concerned with itinerant electron systems , the corresponding behavior of localized electrons is worth serious consideration , too .",
    "for instance , some proposals for solid state quantum computing are based on manipulating the electronic or nuclear spin state of impurities.@xcite    one possibility of affecting the spin behavior through electrical means is by utilizing two - dimensional structures ( semi - conductor interfaces or heterostructures ) showing rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi).@xcite this paper considers a model , which consists of a two - dimensional system of localized electronic states .",
    "charge transport is possible through thermal activation ( hopping transport).@xcite the spin dynamics is assumed to be determined by rashba soi .    in a former publication@xcite we derived microscopic and macroscopic transport equations for charge and spin of",
    "an ordered ( polaronic ) hopping system with rashba soi . here",
    ", we generalize this theory to the case of spatial ( i.e.  not energetic ) disorder",
    ". a suitable reference system would be nearest - neighbor hopping between donors in a semi - conductor or between anderson localized states .",
    "the central approximation concerning spin behavior in hopping systems , which applies to this investigation , consists in the assumption , that the spin degree of freedom is solely influenced by rashba soi , i.e. , there must be no spin dependent scattering ( only s - wave scattering , no magnetic scatterers ) .",
    "furthermore , the rashba length , i.e.  the length scale over which the spin rotation occurs , must be large compared to a typical hopping length @xmath0 .    in sec .",
    "[ sectrans ] the ( disorder averaged ) transport equations for spin are derived for a disordered hopping system and their relation to the charge transport equations is studied .",
    "the ( averaged or macroscopic ) evolution equations governing charge transport ( drift - diffusion equations ) keep their functional shape in the transition from an ordered to a disordered system , the only effect being , that the diffusion constant and the mobility become frequency dependent ( or , expressed differently : the macroscopic evolution equations for the disordered system have memory , even if the microscopic equations did not ) .",
    "we show , that the equations for spin dynamics due to rashba soi likewise keep their functional shape in the presence of disorder , provided the hopping length is sufficiently short .",
    "furthermore , the only differences to the ordered case are again a frequency dependence of the diffusion constant and the mobility of the _",
    "charge_. thus , provided the length scale for spin inversion due to rashba soi ( which will be denoted as the `` rashba length '' in the following ) is large in comparison with the typical hopping length , the influence of disorder on the spin dynamics is entirely determined by the corresponding change of the charge transport coefficients .",
    "two different situations are considered in detail : the temporal evolution of an initial spin polarization is investigated ( sec .",
    "[ secinipol ] ) and the stationary state of a system with spin polarized boundary conditions is determined ( sec .",
    "[ secboundcond ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the analytical treatment is compared with numerical simulations .",
    "it is found , that the spin life - time strongly increases with increasing disorder . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial behavior of the diffusing spin in the stationary case is practically unaffected by the introduction of disorder . additionally , the finding , previously made for an ordered rashba hopping system , that there is a critical electrical field , above which the total spin polarization has an oscillatory component , is also stable against the introduction of topological disorder .",
    "section [ secdiss ] gives a summary of the results and discusses the experimental relevance .",
    "the two appendices present details of the derivation of the macroscopic spin evolution equation and its long wave - length limit .",
    "the equations which govern the evolution of charge and spin density of a hopping system with rashba soi have been derived in refs .. these microscopic transport equations are rate equations for the occupation numbers and the spin expectation values of the localized sites.@xcite it is found , that the transition matrix elements between different localized sites obtains the spin - dependent factor @xmath1 due to rashba soi . here",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the vector of pauli spin matrices , @xmath3 is the distance vector between sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a vector normal to the two - dimensional plane , the length of which is proportional to the rashba coupling strength .",
    "its inverse @xmath7 has the dimension of a length and will in the following be called rashba length .",
    "the derivation of the rate equations is subject to the following restrictions : ( i ) single particle approximation ( i.e.  no electron - electron interaction ) , ( ii ) markovian rate equations ( i.e.  the relevant times are beyond the quantum kinetic regime ) , and ( iii ) the rashba length is large compared with typical hopping length scales , @xmath8 . in this paper , we furthermore restrict ourselves to : ( iv ) two site hopping probabilities .",
    "this gives the leading contribution to hopping transport , the small parameter being the ratio between the resonance integral and the energetic width of the set of electron states .",
    "ohmic charge transport is adequately described by this approximation , but higher order effects , as e.g. the hall effect , are neglected .    the corresponding rate equations read@xcite @xmath9 for the occupation numbers and @xmath10 for the spin orientation . here , @xmath11 is the occupation number of site @xmath5 , @xmath12 is the expectation value of the spin operator on this site , @xmath13 is the transition rate between sites @xmath14 and @xmath5 , and @xmath15 is a @xmath16-matrix , which describes a rotation of the spin during the transition .",
    "an explicit expression of this matrix is given in eq .",
    "( [ dofr ] ) .",
    "note , that the two sets of equations are decoupled in the chosen approximation ( due to the restriction to two site hopping probabilities ) .",
    "this means , that the charge ( or particle ) transport has no influence on the spin transport and vice versa .",
    "thus , such an interesting phenomenon as the spin hall effect,@xcite which already has been studied for ordered hopping systems@xcite and which has sparked controversial discussions recently,@xcite lies outside the scope of the theory presented here .",
    "reference utilized these rate equations in order to study the behavior of an ordered ( polaronic ) hopping system . here",
    ", a topologically disordered hopping system is the subject of investigation .",
    "thus , a disorder average has to be performed , in order to obtain macroscopic transport equations .",
    "appendix [ appdprod ] gives the technical details of the derivation of the macroscopic transport equations subject to the restrictions given above .",
    "it proceeds along the lines of a `` generic '' averaging procedure , following the approach used in ref .  .    since the disorder averaged system is homogeneous , it is convenient to work in wave - vector space .",

    "thus , provided @xmath27 is sufficiently small , the long wave - length limit is also applicable to the integrand in eq.([vecrhosq ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath8 already assures this , since wave - vectors corresponding to the ( inverse of the ) typical hopping length are within the long wave - length limit .",
    "this can safely be assumed , because already for charge transport , we are not concerned with effects due to higher than the second spatial derivative of @xmath28 in the corresponding evolution equation .    using expression ( [ wsqisotrop ] ) , the integral in eq .",

    "the solution here is written with trigonometric functions , which is the appropriate form for @xmath58 . in the case",
    "@xmath59 , hyperbolic functions have to be used instead .",

    "secondly , the system is subjected to boundary conditions , which correspond to spin injection , and the spatial behavior of spin polarization in the stationary state is determined ( calculation b , corresponding to sec.[secboundcond ] ) .",
    "this is done by solving a linear system of equations .",
    "again , a disorder average must then be performed .",
    "the disorder averages are performed over about 50 or 1000 realizations for calculation a or b , respectively . in each case , the statistical error is of the order of the symbol size in the figures . the number of sites in the calculations varies between about 1600 and 5000 .",
    "it has been taken care , that the results are not affected by boundary effects .",
    "the transition rates for the simulation are taken to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the attempt frequency ( subsuming , e.g. , the temperature dependence of the rates ) and determines the numerical time scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 is the inverse localization length of a single impurity state . denoting by @xmath89 the ( areal ) density of localized states , the quantity @xmath90 provides a measure of the disorder .",
    "calculations a and b complement each other . calculation a allows to study the temporal behavior , but the numerical complexity forbids to investigate systems with large disorder ( large @xmath90 ) .",
    "large disorder implies a large dispersion ( typically many orders of magnitude ) of relevant hopping times . since the numerical time step for a differential equation solver has to be related to the smallest relevant time scale , but the long time physics is related to the largest relevant time scale , the study of systems with large disorder leads to an enormous increase in the number of time steps to be calculated , if one is interested in the long time behavior .",
    "furthermore , for larger disorder , the typical behavior can only be found in systems , which are spatially more extended .",
    "this increases the numerical expense even further .",
    "thus , only relatively small values of @xmath90 and/or @xmath91 can be investigated by a numerical integration of the rate equations .    on the other hand ,",
    "calculation b immediately gives the @xmath92 behavior with a reasonable effort even for systems with large disorder .",
    "however , the temporal behavior is not accessible .    to be specific , in calculation",
    "a we take the initial condition @xmath54 .",
    "that means , we consider a system with an initial spin polarization in the @xmath45-direction .",

    "a , where the time evolution of each system is known , effective quantities are determined by @xmath94 and @xmath95 from charge diffusion and drift .",
    "the brackets @xmath96 denote the disorder average .",
    "method b poses a problem here , since the diffusion co - efficient can not be directly measured in this case .",
    "fortunately only the quotient @xmath97 , which could be obtained using the einstein relation , enters the analytic expressions .    the relation between the effective quantity @xmath98 and those occurring in the analytical expressions [ @xmath99 , the inverse laplace transform of @xmath36 ] is unfortunately not simple , but rather involves differentiation operations : @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "a corresponding expression connects @xmath102 and @xmath23 .",
    "numerical differentiation of noisy data ( the disorder averaged @xmath103 ) is highly unstable , so that the direct comparison of the numerical results and the analytic expressions ( but using the numerically obtained @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) is not reasonable .",
    "the situation were much improved , if a general model for the behavior of @xmath99 for the system under consideration were available , but no such model is available for the range of parameters considered here .",
    "thus , we take a different approach .",
    "the asymptotic values of @xmath98 and @xmath104 are the same for very small ( @xmath105 ) or for very large times ( dc - behavior ) . in between , for moderate times ,",
    "the detailed behavior differs , but , since they change monotonically over several orders of magnitude@xcite ( see fig.[fig1a ] ) , we expect the markovian limit of the transport equations to be valid in the following sense . because @xmath99 and @xmath106 decrease over many orders of magnitude with increasing t , the main contribution to the time integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ rhooftint ] ) and ( [ rhovecoftint ] ) comes from small times @xmath107 .",
    "the charge and spin density is taken out of the integral ( as in the derivation of a markovian equation ) , the remaining time integrals replaced by @xmath108 , and for @xmath23 accordingly .",

    "the general trend of diminishing the decay rate and the frequency , however , is in accord with the numerical evidence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    note ,",
    "that the oscillatory behavior of the total spin polarization for @xmath58 , which has been predicted for ordered hopping systems@xcite survives the introduction of disorder .",
    "furthermore , figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig2a ] show , that increasing disorder ( increasing @xmath90 ) leads to an increase of the spin life - time .",
    "this can be readily explained by noting the strong decrease of the diffusion constant in the transport equations , a conclusion , which is confirmed by the agreement between numerical simulation and analytical calculation .",
    "the results of calculation b ( spin injection with boundary conditions ) are shown in fig .",
    "the only parameter of the analytical expressions is the ratio @xmath118 which is assumed to take the value given by the einstein relation ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the agreement to the analytical expressions ( [ rhovecofx ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is convincing .",
    "note , that in this case , no parameter had to be obtained from charge transport .",
    "instead , the temperature used in the numerical simulation is used in the analytical calculation , too .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows only the results for the single disorder parameter @xmath114 , but the good agreement between numerics and eq .",
    "( [ rhovecofx ] ) holds also for the other investigated parameters ( disorder @xmath120 in small or medium fields @xmath121 ) .",
    "a deviation is only found in very large electrical fields ( @xmath122 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . the spatial spin coherence in calculation b diminishes with increasing @xmath90 in large electrical fields .",
    "the numerical data can still be fitted to the analytical model , but with a larger value of @xmath57 as given by the einstein relation ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates , that the ratio @xmath118 increases beyond the equilibrium value @xmath119 in large fields , but otherwise , the spin behavior is still described by eq .",
    "( [ rhovecofx ] ) .",
    "this is indicative of a transition from isotropic to directed percolation in a growing electric field .",
    "this transition leaves the diffusion constant nearly unaffected , while the mobility decreases .",
    "this scenario can explain the observed behavior qualitatively , but further research is necessary to illuminate the true physical basis of the observed behavior and exclude other possible explanations .",
    "we have derived macroscopic spin transport equations for spatially disordered hopping systems with rashba soi .",
    "it is found , that the introduction of disorder leaves the vectorial structure of these equations intact , the only effect being that diffusion constant and mobility become frequency dependent ( or , expressed differently , that the transport equations obtain memory ) .",
    "this frequency dependence is already determined by the charge transport behavior and does not depend on the specifics of spin transport .",
    "the derivation of this relation between ordered and disordered hopping spin transport is subject to the approximation , that the rashba length ( the length scale of spin precession ) is large against a typical hopping length .",
    "furthermore , only two - site hopping processes can be dealt with in the present treatment , thus excluding , e.g. , the discussion of a possible spin hall effect .    other effects , previously predicted for ordered spin hopping , also occur for disordered spin hopping .",
    "for instance , the spin decay is exponential in small electric fields , whereas it obtains an oscillatory component in large electric fields .",
    "thus , there is a finite critical field , dividing both regimes , also in the disordered case .",
    "it is also conceivable that the behavior `` oscillates '' between exponential and vibrational behavior . but",
    "this can be excluded , so far as @xmath99 and @xmath106 change monotonically with time .    in comparison to the ordered case , the spin life - time is shown to be strongly increased by the introduction of disorder .",
    "this is explained by the significantly reduced diffusion constant , which enters the life - time reciprocally and which sharply decreases with increasing disorder .    for the stationary state of spins injected through a boundary into a topologically disorder hopping system ,",
    "it is found , that the spatial behavior of the spin polarization is largely unaffected by varying the disorder .",
    "an exception to this insensitivity is the systematic reduction of spin polarization with increasing disorder in large in - plane electric fields @xmath122 .",
    "but even here , the numerical data indicate , that the phenomenological description of spin transport , which is derived in this paper , is still valid .",
    "the deviation appears to be due to the invalidity of the einstein relation between diffusion co - efficient and mobility in strong electric fields for the considered system , and is not a consequence of the peculiarities of spin transport .",
    "a comment concerning the required smallness of the rashba interaction is in order here . for the value @xmath123 ( the largest value used in the simulations ) the spin reverses over a distance of the order of about ten times the mean distance between impurities .",
    "the typical hopping length also is several mean distances long .",
    "thus , the central condition @xmath8 is hardly valid .",
    "this ( large ) value of @xmath27 has been taken for numerical reasons , but even so , the agreement with theory is very good .",
    "this shows , that the phenomenological description of spin transport derived above is quite robust even for ( relatively ) large values of the rashba interaction strength .",
    "smaller ( more realistic ) values of the rashba coupling @xmath27 render the approximation all the more valid .    finally , a few words concerning the experimental relevance of this work . usually given values for the rashba soi strength ( @xmath124  ev  cm)@xcite lead to a rashba length of the order of @xmath125   , if one assumes that the effective electron mass is equal to its elementary mass.@xcite this length scale is in the range of typical hopping lengths .",
    "thus , depending on the system under consideration , the theory presented here is a candidate for a description of the physical behavior . for the value of the rashba coupling given above and at a temperature of 10  k , the critical electrical field @xmath126 , which differentiates between exponential and oscillatory behavior of the total spin polarization , corresponds to a field of about @xmath127  v / cm in natural units .    to the authors knowledge",
    ", the value of the rashba coupling strength in hopping systems has not been investigated up to now .",
    "it may well be , that this value is smaller than for itinerant electrons , in which case the estimate given above for the rashba length ( 100   ) must be increased .",
    "then , it is even easier to comply with the condition @xmath8 .",
    "a further advantage of this case would be , that a modification of the rashba coupling strength by an external gate electrode@xcite would require smaller applied voltages .",
    "the aim is to derive macroscopic transport equations starting from the microscopic equations ( [ raterho2 m ] ) , the master equation for particle ( respectively charge ) transport , and ( [ ratevecrho2 m ] ) , the equation governing the spin evolution . in the following , we show that under the approximation of a large rashba length @xmath8 , the disorder average of eq .",

    "the `` generic '' averaging procedure follows the procedure used by klafter and silbey@xcite which they employed to study the connection between the continuous time random walk approach and the exact ( generalized ) master equation .",
    "we assume , that the spatially disordered system can be adequately represented using an ordered host lattice with very small lattice constant .",
    "then only some sites of the host lattice correspond to the original sites and are available for transport , whereas all other host lattice sites are unavailable in a specific disorder realization .",
    "the transition rates @xmath13 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath14 correspond to sites of the original [ disordered ] model ) can be generalized to transition rates @xmath128 on the host lattice , such that @xmath128 vanishes , except when both sites are available as defined above . using",
    "this ordered representation of the originally disordered problem , one can construct a formal solution and thereafter perform the disorder average ( see ref .  ) . in this way , one obtains a generalized master equation ( gme ) for the ( averaged or macroscopic ) disordered system , which is formally exact . approximations ( as , e.g. , the continuous time random walk considered in ref . )",
    "are only needed thereafter , in order to obtain explicit expressions for the transition rates of the gme and thus be able to calculate solutions of the gme . in the following paragraph",
    "we will show that , provided @xmath8 , the derivation of the formally exact gme for charge transport [ starting from eq .",
    "( [ raterho2 m ] ) ] can nearly unaltered be applied to spin transport [ starting from eq .",
    "( [ ratevecrho2 m ] ) ] , too . in this way ,",
    "any approximations , which are applied to the charge transport gme , yield immediately a corresponding spin transport gme without the need to introduce further approximations ( except @xmath8 of course ) .",
    "we denote the ( disordered ) transition rates on the ordered host lattice ( with site indices @xmath129 , etc . ) by @xmath130 and introduce diagonal elements by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is equal to unity or to zero , when the host lattice site @xmath129 coincides or not with an original site @xmath5 in the current disorder realization , respectively .",
    "then , the charge transport rate equation can be written as @xmath133 these equations can equivalently be expressed as a matrix equation , such that , if @xmath134 denotes the number of sites of the host lattice , the @xmath135 become an @xmath134-vector @xmath136 and correspondingly @xmath128 becomes an @xmath137-matrix @xmath138 .",
    "the rate equation then takes the simple form @xmath139 , or , in laplace space @xmath140\\underline{\\rho } = \\underline{\\rho}_0 $ ] , where the index @xmath141 marks the initial conditions .",

    "the second equation constitutes the definition of the self - energy @xmath144 , the elements of which are the ( as yet exact , but only formally defined ) transition rates of the gme @xmath145    conservation of probability allows to write this equation in the usual form @xmath146,\\ ] ] where the sum now excludes the term @xmath147 .",
    "note , that this equation lives on an ordered ( quasi - continuous ) lattice in contrast to eq.([raterho2 m ] ) .",
    "one can see , that the formal structure of eq.([raterho2 m ] ) has survived the averaging , except that the transition rates have become frequency dependent .",
    "thus , even though the microscopic equations ( [ raterho2 m ] ) are markovian , the macroscopic ( averaged ) equations can be non - markovian .",
    "let us now execute the same procedure for the spin density .",
    "the quantity @xmath148 is a 3-vector , thus @xmath149 lives in the cartesian product space of 3-vectors and @xmath134-vectors .",
    "the transition rates are products @xmath150 , where @xmath151 determines the action in 3-space and @xmath128 is identical to the corresponding quantity defined above for charge transport .",
    "note , that we do not need a special rule for the `` diagonal elements '' , because @xmath152 is the unity matrix .",
    "thus , the formal solution is @xmath153^{-1}\\right\\rangle \\cdot\\underline{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_0 = [ s-\\underline{\\underline{\\hat{m}}}(s)]^{-1 } \\cdot\\underline{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_0 , \\label{rhovec2}\\ ] ] defining the quantity @xmath154 .",
    "we now introduce the assumption , that a product of several rotation matrices @xmath31 obeys the relation @xmath155 this equation is valid to first order in @xmath27 .",

    "the fact , that eq .",

    "three - site probabilities yield interesting physics@xcite as , e.g. , the spin hall effect , but those effects are of higher order in @xmath27 .    within the approximation ( [ dproduct ] ) ,",

    "the application of approximation ( [ dproduct ] ) again leads to the conclusion ( [ mhatofd ] ) .",
    "homogeneity of the averaged system implies , that @xmath168 only depends on the difference vector between the sites @xmath169 .",
    "thus , it is convenient to work in wave - vector space .",
    "the disorder averaged rate equations in fourier - laplace space then become the eqs .",

    "the following expressions are written in the right - handed orthonormal basis @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "the spin rotation matrix for a transition between sites @xmath5 and @xmath14 depends only on the distance vector between both sites @xmath176 . the explicit expression for this quantity is@xcite @xmath177    first",

    "the ( lengthy ) calculation is not given here in detail , but proceeds in the following way : the ( divergent ) fourier integral of @xmath179 is made convergent by introducing the factor @xmath180 with a positive parameter @xmath88 .",
