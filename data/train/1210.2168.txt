    "in the search for an explanation of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe , theorists have questioned the validity of general relativity . while the cosmological constant is the easiest explanation and in very good agreement with observations so far ,",
    "its magnitude and origin remain a mystery and other explanations are searched for .",
    "theories such as @xmath1-theories , massive gravity , galileon models and other interacting dark energy models have been studied in much detail and their phenomenological consequences explored .",
    "most of these theories give rise to deviations from the @xmath2cdm model which can be looked for with future observations and therefore models will be discarded or heavily constrained .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for excellent reviews .",
    "in this paper we consider scalar - tensor theories of gravity as an extension of general relativity .",
    "these theories have been revived recently , either because they are equivalent to some theories mentioned above ( for example @xmath1 models can be written in the form of a scalar - tensor theory ) or they describe limits of those theories . here , we consider not only conformal couplings of matter to the scalar field but also disformal couplings , as motivated for example from galileon models , certain limits of massive gravity and lorentz - breaking models of gravity @xcite . as we will see , the effective couplings of matter to the scalar degree of freedom are much more complicated expressions and depend not only on the scalar field itself but also on its time variation .",
    "such models motivate time - varying effective couplings .",
    "unfortunately , it has recently been shown that disformal couplings are difficult to constrain with local experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , as an application , we study the consequences of modifications of gravity in the radiation dominated epoch . in particular , we find a generic expression for the sound - speed of the tightly coupled photon - baryon fluid in theories with conformal and disformal couplings and calculate the distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) caused by the dissipation of acoustic waves .",
    "as is well known , the dissipation of acoustic waves injects energy into the photons and therefore produces slight deviations from the blackbody spectrum by producing a positive chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "the deviations are small ; the chemical potential created by the dissipation of acoustic waves is of order @xmath3 in the standard inflationary scenario and is not in violation of the current constraint @xmath4 ( for work on these issues , see e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "proposed experiments such as pixie , however , reach this sensitivity to search for deviations of the order @xmath5 @xcite . as such , these observations",
    "probe the primordial power spectrum at very small scales and constrain the inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "we point out that in general modifications of gravity change the spectral distortions because of the different sound - speed of the coupled photon - baryon plasma . for theories in which the field is very heavy the",
    "sound - speed is smaller than in general relativity and thus an absence of a @xmath0-type distortion in the cmb spectrum could be explained by a lower sound - speed during the epoch when the distortion is created ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , the sound horizon is well constrained by measurements of the cmb anisotropies ( e.g. the position of the first peak is well known ) , and , as we will see , this further constrains the type of modified gravity theories which are allowed .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath0distortion is the earliest direct probe of modifications of gravity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the action considered in this paper , write down the perturbation equations which govern the dynamics of the coupled photon - baryon fluid and derive the effective coupling between the scalar field and matter and the effective sound - speed for the coupled photon - baryon fluid . in section 3 we calculate the @xmath7distortion . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions and an outlook of future work .",
    "the action we are considering is of scalar - tensor form , namely = d^4 x+ s_matter ( _ i , g_^(i ) ) , in which @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , @xmath9 are the matter fields in the theory ( relativistic and non - relativistic ) , @xmath10 is an additional scalar degree of freedom and the metrics @xmath11 are related to the metric @xmath12 by [ disformalmetric ] g_^(i ) = c^(i)()g_+d^(i ) ( ) _ _  .",
    "each matter species can , in general , couple to a different metric , in which the couplings are described by the functions @xmath13 ( called the conformal factor ) and @xmath14 ( called the disformal factor ) . however , multiple couplings greatly complicate the equations of motion and in this paper we will consider a coupling to a single species only .",
    "we will return to multiple couplings in future work .",
    "the field equations can easily be obtained from the action above @xcite .",
    "the scalar field equation is given by g^ _",
    "_ - + q= 0 , with q = t^ _   -_(_,t^ ) + _ , _ , t^ and @xmath15 being the energy - momentum tensor of the species coupled to @xmath10 , which is consequently not conserved : [ emconservation ] _ t^ _ = q _ , .",
    "we will write down the equations for the perturbations only and work in the conformal ( newtonian ) gauge in which the metric is given by ds^2 = a^2()[-(1 + 2)d^2 + ( 1 - 2)_ijdx^i dx^j ] . perturbing equation ( [ emconservation ] ) yields the following equations @xmath16 whilst the scalar field perturbations obey the klein - gordon equation + 2h+(k^2+a^2v)= ( + 3)-2a^2(v-q_0)+a^2q .",
    "the zero - order part of @xmath17 is [ qbackgroundcoupling ] q_0 = -_i , and the perturbation of @xmath17 is [ qperturb ] q = -[b_1_i+b_2+b_3+b_4+b_5 ] , where @xmath18 and the subscript @xmath19 denotes the species the field is coupled to .",
    "the expression for @xmath20 agrees with @xcite for the case @xmath21 .    for the rest of this paper we shall look at the case when the scalar field is coupled to baryons only .",
    "we are treating photons and baryons as fluids , coupled via thomson scattering . for photons and baryons ,",
    "( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) become    @xmath22    where we have added the interaction terms for thomson scattering and @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested in scales much smaller than the horizon and on time - scales much smaller than the hubble expansion rate . to derive a second order differential equation for @xmath24",
    ", we ignore therefore terms which involve the hubble expansion rate , the time - evolution of the background scalar field , and the time - derivatives of the scalar field perturbations and the gravitational potential . in this limit",
    ", the relevant equations read @xmath25 where q_0 = _ b , q = -[b_1_b+b_5 ] , and @xmath26 from equation ( [ shkg ] ) we find = -_b.[deltaphi ] to leading order in the tight - coupling approximation @xmath27 which implies _ _ b , [ tightcouplapprox ] and therefore _",
    "b _ .[adiabaticity ] additionally it can be shown ( e.g. @xcite ) that _ = _ , and so we can neglect the anisotropic stress . using equation ( [ tightcouplapprox ] ) on the left - hand side of equation ( [ shthetabdot ] ) we have ( _ -_b ) = r(_-k^2+k^2 ) , which can be inserted in equation ( [ shthetagammadot ] ) to get _",
    "= k^2_+k^2+r(_-k^2+k^2 ) . rearranging and using equation ( [ shdeltagammadot ] ) we find _ = -_-k^2 + .",
    "we can then substitute for @xmath28 using equations ( [ deltaphi ] ) and ( [ adiabaticity ] ) and this leads to _ + ( 1 + 3rf)k^2c_s^2_= - , where @xmath29 is the standard sound - speed and = . from this equation",
    "we can read off the modified sound - speed _ s^2 = c_s^2(1 + 3rf ) , which reduces to the expression given in @xcite for the purely conformal case .    to account for silk damping",
    "it is necessary to go beyond leading order in the tight - coupling approximation . doing so ( see the appendix for a derivation ) yields _ e^ikr_se^-k^2/k_d^2 where _ s = _ 0^c_sd is the sound horizon ( which in general differs from its value in general relativity ) and @xmath30 is the modified damping wavenumber : = _ z^. it can be seen that the additional terms are multiplied by @xmath31 .",
    "deep in the radiation dominated epoch when @xmath32 these terms will be totally insignificant .",
    "we found that these modifications are irrelevant for the @xmath0distortion considered in the next section .",
    "the evolution of @xmath33 depends on the details of the coupling functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 and can be very complicated , even in purely conformal theories @xmath34 . potentially , @xmath35 can become negative , signalling instabilities .",
    "we will , in this paper , not study the consequences of an imaginary sound - speed during the radiation dominated epoch , although it would be interesting to study black hole formation on small scales in these scenarios .",
    "there are several observables which depend on the sound - speed and can therefore be used to search for deviations from general relativity . in this paper",
    "we consider two of them , namely the sound horizon at decoupling and the @xmath0distortion .",
    "the sound horizon at decoupling determines , for example , the position of the peaks in the anisotropy spectrum .",
    "since the position of the first peak is well known , @xmath36 can not vary too much from its value in general relativity . as an integral of @xmath33 over time ,",
    "@xmath36 is dependent mostly on the evolution of @xmath33 for redshifts below @xmath37 or so .",
    "the @xmath0distortion of the cmb blackbody spectrum is created in the redshift range @xmath38 and probes length scales of order @xmath39 mpc@xmath40 to @xmath41 mpc@xmath40 . as such , @xmath0 does not only provide useful information about the primordial curvature perturbation and therefore about about inflationary physics , but also about modifications of gravity .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0distortion of the cmb spectrum is the earliest possible direct probe of modifications of gravity available to us .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to calculate @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0distortion is given by @xcite = -+1.4 , where the last term describes the change of @xmath0 due to the input of energy into the coupled photon - baryon fluid and the first term describes the thermalization process with @xmath42 being the double compton scattering time scale .",
    "we will give the expression for @xmath43 below .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath44 where z_dc = 1.9710 ^ 6(1-())^-2/5()^-2/5 , and @xmath45 is the primordial helium mass fraction .    to calculate the energy input , we follow @xcite who showed that the energy density of an acoustic wave in the photon - baryon plasma can be written as [ energydensity ] q = _ _ p , where we here ignore the baryon density ( which is much smaller than the energy density in photons @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the sound - speed of the wave , @xmath24 is the photon density contrast , @xmath48 and the average @xmath49 denotes an average over one period of oscillation . we have _",
    "p = p_(k ) , where @xmath50 is the power spectrum of the photon density contrast .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath51 for scales well within the horizon can be related to the primordial power spectrum @xmath52 by p_(k ) = _ ^2(k)p_^i(k ) , where @xmath53 is the transfer function . in general relativity",
    ", the transfer function reads _",
    "( k ) = 3cos(kr_s)e^-k^2/k_d^2 , where @xmath54 is the sound horizon and @xmath55 is the diffusion scale .",
    "the factor of 3 takes into account for the fact that the potential is decaying on super - horizon scales , leading to an enhancement in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is here that modifications of gravity could play an important role too : if the field is light ( @xmath56 ) the enhancement might be larger or smaller , depending on the coupling functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , in theories such as chameleon theories , the mass of the scalar degree of freedom is much larger than the hubble expansion rate @xmath59 and the field is short ranged .",
    "this is the case we are considering in this paper and so we expect the factor of 3 to be a very good approximation in the theories we consider here .",
    "we will return to the case @xmath56 in a separate publication @xcite in which we discuss the transfer functions for other types of theories of modified gravity .",
    "the primordial power spectrum can be written @xcite p_^i(k ) 1.45p_= 1.45a_()^n_s-1 + ( ) where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the spectral index and @xmath63 is the running of the index .    in the standard case",
    "@xmath33 is independent of the wavenumber @xmath64 , but as we have seen , the interaction of the baryons with the scalar field causes @xmath33 to be dependent on the wavenumber .",
    "we are interested in scales much smaller than the interaction range of the scalar field @xmath65 and @xmath33 is only varying very slowly in time . using equation ( [ energydensity ] ) for a wave with a given wave vector @xmath66",
    ", one can derive the energy density of that wave .",
    "integrating then over all waves gives the total energy density = _",
    "^2(k)p_^i(k )  .    then using the fact that the average over one oscillation of @xmath67 is @xmath68 and treating the photon density as effectively constant over the timescales considered",
    "we can obtain the energy release per unit redshift = 1.174510 ^ -8 ( ) ^n_s-1+_sln()(c^2_s(k ) e^-2k^2/k_d^2 ) .",
    "we can then use this expression to evaluate equation ( [ mu ] ) .    for the models considered here",
    "the effect of modified gravity on @xmath0 comes solely from the modified sound - speed .",
    "how @xmath69 deviates from its evolution in general relativity depends on the coupling functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the potential @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , a plethora of possibilities could be explored . to be specific however , in this paper",
    "we focus on the purely conformal case for which ( with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) the effective sound - speed can be written as c_s^2= c_s^2 ( 1- ) . in this case",
    "the effective sound - speed is _ smaller _ than in general relativity .",
    "precisely when and how much smaller is dictated by how the coupling stength @xmath73 and the mass ( @xmath74 ) evolve in time .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the deviation of @xmath75 from its value in general relativity .",
    "we find [ deva ] a = looking at a regime for which @xmath76 and @xmath77 mpc@xmath40 , we find @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for @xmath81 . therefore ,",
    "rather large couplings are needed in this case for the sound - speed to deviate significantly from its value in general relativity . as mentioned above , for such a theory to be consistent with the observed cmb anisotropies",
    ", the sound horizon can not be modified very much .",
    "therefore @xmath82 has to become small before decoupling which requires that either @xmath73 decreases or @xmath83 increases well before decoupling . in the example that follows we focus on the former case for which @xmath73 becomes smaller in time and as a concrete example we consider    = b , where @xmath84 is a redshift after which the coupling becomes rapidly smaller , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants . for the mass",
    "we assume that    m(z ) = m_rat h(z ) , with @xmath87 being a constant . in fig .",
    "1 we show the evolution of @xmath33 for a couple of choices for @xmath88 and @xmath87 . in the first case ,",
    "the sound - speed deviates from its value in general relativity at high redshifts ( @xmath89 ) , but approaches the standard value quickly for @xmath90 . in the second case ,",
    "the deviation is quite large for @xmath91 , so @xmath33 approaches @xmath47 at a later time than in the first example and the maximum deviation is greater in this case . in both cases",
    "the sound - speed approaches its standard value in general relativity . a motivation for the behaviour of @xmath73 could be that general relativity is an attractor in the radiation dominated epoch ( see e.g. @xcite for early ideas on such models ) .",

    "as expected , the predicted @xmath0 is smaller than in general relativity since @xmath33 is smaller . for the examples shown we see that the predictions for @xmath0 are very similar , although the evolution of the sound - speed is significantly different .",

    "this example is ruled out by observations of the cmb anisotropies and was added just for illustration .",
    "what becomes clear from these considerations ( and from eq .",
    "( [ deva ] ) ) is that it is the interplay between @xmath73 and @xmath83 ( both their magnitude and evolution ) which determines the predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath106 . even in the case of purely conformal couplings , with different choices for @xmath73 and @xmath83 a range of possible deviations in either @xmath106 or @xmath0 ( or both )",
    "can be obtained . if we were to allow for a disformal coupling as well ( @xmath107 ) , the results for @xmath0 and @xmath106 would also depend on the first derivative of the potential and , in general , on the evolution of @xmath10 , at which point general statements about predictions and trends are no longer useful but instead concrete models ( i.e. concrete choices for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath70 ) have to be studied @xcite .",
    "the results above show that the @xmath0distortion of the cmb is a useful tool to constrain modifications of gravity further .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarised as follows : firstly , we have derived the general coupling of a fluid ( relativistic or non - relativistic ) to a scalar field , whose influence is described by the effective metric given in eq .",
    "( [ disformalmetric ] ) .",
    "we allowed not only for conformal but also for disformal couplings and the expressions in section 2 are generic when the scalar field is coupled to _",
    "one _ species only , whose equation of state is @xmath108 . as is clear from section 2 , already in this case the evolution of the effective coupling ( e.g. @xmath109 in equation ( [ qbackgroundcoupling ] ) for the background evolution ) can be rather complicated . the evolution of its perturbation ( given in eq .",
    "( [ qperturb ] ) ) is even more complicated .",
    "therefore , in those scenarios , the coupling is in general a function of time .",
    "this opens the door to a rich phenomenology .    secondly , focusing on the case of the scalar field coupled to baryons , we have derived the expression for the effective sound - speed of the tightly coupled photon - baryon fluid , which differs from the expression in general relativity .",
    "as we have pointed out , the @xmath0distortion of the cmb can be used to constrain the evolution of @xmath33 and therefore constrain modifications of gravity at very high redshifts ( @xmath38 ) and small length scales ( @xmath110 mpc@xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , thirdly we have calculated the @xmath0distortion for a simple case in which the coupling becomes smaller as time progresses . in this case , the @xmath0distortion is smaller than in general relativity , because the sound - speed is smaller . whether this is generic requires a comprehensive analysis of different choices for the functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath70 .",
    "we will study this in future publications @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0distortion of the cmb spectrum is a useful additional probe for testing gravity and not only for the primordial power spectrum of perturbations .",
