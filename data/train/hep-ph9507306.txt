    "it is a fundamental result of quantum statistics that above a certain critical density all added bosons must enter the ground state : a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) forms .",
    "gas of weakly interacting bosons allows a well - defined theoretical microscopic treatment of this process .",
    "however , bose condensation has not yet been observed in a real physical system which could be described as an ideal gas .",
    "superfluid @xmath3he , for example , is a system with very strong interaction and is considered as a quantum liquid .",
    "one can reach bose condensation by gradually decreasing the temperature in a sequence of equilibrium states . an appropriate description of this regime is given by the well - known theory of second order phase transitions @xcite . on the other hand , the conditions for the formation of a bose condensate can appear when the system is far from equilibrium .",
    "this will be generally true for the condensation of an ideal gas because of the weakness of interaction .",
    "the kinetics of bose - condensation in this case is an important and interesting problem .",
    "recently this subject has attracted particular interest in connection with the exciting prospects for experimental observation of a bose condensation in very cold atomic samples , _",
    "e.g. _ in a gas of spin - polarized atomic hydrogen @xcite or in alkali - metal vapors @xcite , as well as in the gas of excitons ( bound states of electrons and holes in semiconductors ) @xcite . for instance , doyle _ et .",
    "@xcite report to have attained @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which is only a factor of 3 above the temperature of bose condensation at this density .",
    "since the life - time of a sample in all experiments is finite and short , the question of a time - scale for the formation of bose - condensate is a central one .",
    "another interesting application of bose kinetics is rather far from laboratory experiments and is related to the problem of bose star @xcite formation @xcite from the dark matter in the universe .",
    "the life - time of the `` sample '' is not limited in this case , but in the only model @xcite for bose - star formation which involves a realistic dark matter particle candidate , the axion @xcite , the self - interaction of particles is so weak that the relaxation time is comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "the possibility of bose - star formation becomes dependent upon the exact value of this time - scale .    in experiments with atomic hydrogen or with alkali - metal vapors",
    "the bose - gas is effectively isolated from its surroundings and the relaxation to thermal equilibrium and condensation is expected to occur due to particles self - coupling only .",
    "the same is true for the case of axion miniclusters . on the contrary ,",
    "interaction with the thermal heat bath is important in the dynamics of excitons .",
    "we consider both situations in the present paper .",
    "however , we only consider the simplest @xmath0 self - interaction of structureless scalar particles ( this approximation is exact _",
    "e.g. _ in the axion case ) .",
    "the heat bath is modelled by a gas of heavy fermions .",
    "the process of bose condensation can be divided into three stages .",
    "the first and the third ones are kinetic stages which occur before and after actual nucleation of the condensate . these two stages can be treated with the boltzmann equation which describes restructuring of the distribution function at the first stage and growth of the condensate at the third . a numerical study of these two stages is the purpose of the present paper ( we have reported the main results in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the framework of the kinetic equation",
    "there is no condensate at all times if there was no condensate initially .",
    "therefore we have to add a small seed condensate `` by hand '' in this framework when switching from the first to the third stages .",
    "we switch between stages when the distribution function becomes infinite at zero momentum .",
    "we do not consider the second stage , _ i.e. _ how the condensate actually emerges , which is , in fact , a phase transition .",
    "a description of the second stage has been elaborated in ref .",
    "since the duration of this stage is short and the magnitude of the condensate which appears is small @xcite , our approach seems to be reasonable .",
    "the question of the time evolution of a weakly interacting bose gas during the first kinetic stage was addressed in a number of papers . in earlier treatments an ideal bose gas",
    "was coupled to a thermal bath with infinite heat capacity : to a phonon bath in ref .",
    "@xcite and to a fermi heat bath in ref .",
    "@xcite . a small energy exchange was assumed and after several other approximations a fokker - planck type of equation was obtained .",
    "levich and yahkot @xcite calculated analytically that the time for condensation ( more precisely , the time needed for the distribution function to reach infinity at zero momentum ) is infinite in this situation . by including boson - boson interactions they later @xcite found a solution which describes the explosive emergence of a condensate , but they concluded that this effect could have been an artifact of their approximations .",
    "snoke and wolfe in ref .",
    "@xcite undertook a direct numerical integration of the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "although this calculation demonstrated a restructuring of the distribution of particles , the appearance of a bose condensate ( more precisely , an infinite value of the distribution function at zero momentum ) was not detected .",
    "as compared with ref .",
    "@xcite , we carry out the numerical integration in a much wider dynamical range of relative energies and densities .",
    "the major and important difference of our approach is that we directly analyse the behavior of the distribution function , while snoke and wolfe considered an integrated quantity @xmath7 , the number of particles with the energy less than a given value @xmath8 .",
    "analytical study of bose condensation was performed recently by kagan , svistunov and shlyapnikov in the paper @xcite where three different regimes of evolution were identified and considered .",
    "our numerical results confirm qualitative predictions of that work .",
    "in particular , it was argued that in the kinetic region of the non - linear regime the distribution function has the form @xmath9 for small @xmath8 .",
    "we indeed observe the tendency to this law in our numerical integration , but , while being close to it , the system never reaches this critical exponent .",
    "instead of @xmath10 we obtain 1.24 . moreover ,",
    "this distribution is destroyed when the condensate emerges , the fact that was not stressed in ref.@xcite . as concerns the condensation time , only order of magnitude dimensional estimates were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that during the first kinetic stage the distribution function became infinite at zero momentum in a finite time in the case of self - interacting bosons .",
    "this stage can be divided into two parts . during the first part of the first stage the distribution function",
    "is restructured so that a self - similar solution is formed ; the distribution function does not grow much during this time interval which takes about half of the entire evolution time . during the second part , the distribution function rapidly ( as a pole power law @xmath11 ) reaches infinity at @xmath12 in a self - similar way .",
    "despite the fact that the bose - condensation is inherently based on bose - statistics , the kinetics of this stage is a classical process and not a quantum one . to be precise",
    ", it corresponds to the kinetics of classical waves ( but not classical particles ) . actually , the equations we encounter here and the resulting behavior of the system are well - known in the theory of turbulence @xcite .",
    "this is no wonder .",
    "indeed , a bose condensation occurs when the occupation numbers are large , @xmath13 . in that case",
    "we can replace quantum creation operators by amplitudes of classical waves .",
    "the corresponding kinetic equation can be obtained in two ways : either neglecting @xmath14 in the product of all factors @xmath15 $ ] in the quantum kinetic equation ( by which we neglect the spontaneous scattering with respect to the induced one ) , or directly in the random phase approximation for the ensemble of classical waves @xcite .",
    "the second approach is customary in the theory of turbulence , but the result is the same in both approaches . while it may be more appropriate in the second approach to refer to @xmath16 as a density of waves in phase space , we will continue to call it density of particles in phase space .",
    "the power law behavior of the distribution function we observe , with an exponent close to @xmath17 , is a special case of the kolmogorov turbulence @xcite . indeed , by definition , turbulence is a stationary state characterized by a non - zero flow ( in phase space ) of some conserved quantity . in the case of bose - condensation",
    "we have a flux of particles towards the condensate , which tends to be constant across the energy space , and this corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "an explosive behavior of the distribution function at @xmath12 which we observe was also found in other instances of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the actual nucleation of the condensate can not be described in the framework of the kinetic equation .",
    "but we have to conclude that after the distribution function has become infinite at zero momentum , the condensate forms .",
    "kinetic equations which describe the third stage in the presence of the condensate were derived in refs .",
    "we re - derive those equations in a simpler way which is valid when the difference between particles and quasiparticles is unimportant .",
    "we consider this weak coupling regime only .",
    "we found that during the third stage the evolution is also self - similar until the restructuring in the phase - space reaches the tail of the distribution .",
    "we compare this condensation process , which is due to self - interaction of particles , to the condensation driven by the interaction with a cold bath , for which we also solved the boltzmann equation numerically .",
    "we find that the distribution function grows with time only as @xmath19 in this case .",
    "the energy dependence of the distribution function is also different now . instead of a singular power law profile , @xmath20 , which corresponded to the constant flux of particles towards the condensate , now all excess particles form a well defined packet in the momentum space .",
    "the total number of particles in this packet remains constant during the evolution , while its width decreases , gradually approaching a @xmath21-function @xcite .",
    "this type of behavior is qualitatively different from the one we have in the case of self - interacting bosons .",
    "however , it is also self - similar and one of the predictions of the self - similarity in this case is that @xmath22 . in general",
    ", using the properties of the self - similarity enables us to obtain a number of analytical results , _",
    "e.g. _ the relation of the critical exponent @xmath23 in @xmath24 to the critical exponent @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that the system interacting with a cold bath needs infinite time ( in the kinetic framework ) to reach infinity in the distribution function at @xmath27 does not necessarily mean that the condensation time is infinite for this system .",
    "indeed , the nucleation of the condensate is a phase transition which does not have to occur at the moment when the distribution reaches infinity , and can occur earlier .",
    "although our prime interest and motivation for this work were connected with the physics of bose stars , the problem of condensate formation in a gravitational field has never been considered , and we do not consider it here .",
    "instead , we are solving kinetic equations in flat space - time and only the range of parameters of the initial distribution can reflect the virial equilibrium of a self - gravitating system .",
    "when this work was completed b. svistunov brought to our attention his paper @xcite .",
    "he also analyzed two non - linear kinetic stages exploiting the assumption of self - similarity .",
    "his approach is close to ours and our results qualitatively confirm the results and predictions of ref .",
    "however , he assumed a priory in his analysis that the critical exponent is @xmath28 .",
    "he concluded that this assumption had passed his numerical self - consistency check , but we believe that this is due to the fact that he used energy grid with the minimum value @xmath29 , while in our case it was @xmath30 .    the plan of this work is as follows . in sec .",
