    "galaxy clusters form differently in different cosmological models .",
    "their formation history and their internal structure are influenced by the cosmological parameters .",
    "in dense model universes , @xmath7 , clusters form at significantly lower redshifts than in low - density model universes ( e.g.  richstone , loeb , & turner 1992 ; bartelmann , ehlers , & schneider 1993 ; lacey & cole 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "the cosmological constant has a fairly moderate influence on the formation timescale .",
    "delayed formation is reflected in the abundance of cluster substructure",
    ". moreover , central cluster densities are higher in clusters that form earlier .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the different degrees of cluster substructure expected in cosmological models with different mean densities lead to observational consequences that can significantly distinguish between high- and low - density universes . while earlier studies found cluster x - ray morphologies and density profiles to differ significantly between different cosmologies ( evrard et al.1993 ; crone , evrard , & richstone 1994 ; mohr et al .",
    "1995 ; crone , evrard , & richstone 1996 ) , more recent work concluded that x - ray morphologies of clusters at the present epoch are fairly similar in different cosmological models , rendering significant distinctions difficult ( jing et al .",
    "the issue of constraining cluster shapes using their x - ray emission was also addressed in detail by buote & tsai ( 1995a , b ) .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing effect allows a measurement of the morphology of the projected mass ( wilson , cole , & frenk 1996 ; schneider & bartelmann 1997 ) and constrains cluster density profiles ( crone et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it remains to be shown with realistic numerical cluster models whether this method provides a more sensitive tool to quantify cluster morphologies than that provided by x - ray emission .",
    "an alternative tool is offered by the strong gravitational lens effect . in order to be strong lenses ( i.e.  in order to produce appreciable numbers of large arcs from background sources ) ,",
    "clusters have to satisfy several criteria .",
    "first , they need to be compact , that is , their central surface mass densities need to surmount the critical surface mass density for lensing .",
    "the latter depends on redshift . for background sources at redshifts @xmath8 , clusters at redshifts @xmath9",
    "are the most efficient lenses",
    ". if arcs are to be produced in abundance , a sufficiently large number of concentrated clusters must be in place at those redshifts .",
    "second , strong lensing is a highly non - linear effect .",
    "this is mainly because the number of strong lensing events depends sensitively on the number of cusps in , and the length of , the caustic curves of the lenses .",
    "cusps require asymmetric lenses .",
    "asymmetric , substructured clusters are thus much more efficient in producing large arcs than symmetric clusters , provided the individual cluster sublumps are compact enough ( bartelmann , steinmetz , & weiss 1995 ) .",
    "both arguments show that the influence of cosmology on the structure and the formation timescale of clusters should strongly affect their ability to form large arcs .",
    "clusters that are being assembled from compact subclusters at redshifts where lenses are most efficient , @xmath10 , should produce many more arcs than clusters which form at later redshifts from sublumps which are less compact .",
    "does this line of reasoning imply that different cosmological models can be distinguished by the number of arcs that are expected in them ?",
    "more precisely , does the higher compactness of clusters in low - density universes , and the later formation time of clusters in high - density universes , lead to such different numbers of large arcs that limits on cosmological parameters could be obtained from counting arcs ?",
    "this is the question addressed by this paper .    in order to pursue it ,",
    "we use galaxy clusters simulated in a variety of cosmological models .",
    "the simulations are described in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "the simulated clusters are then investigated as to their strong - lensing effects , following the prescription in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "results are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , and summarised in sect .  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "wu & mao ( 1996 ) already considered the influence of @xmath4 on arc statistics , however with spherically symmetric , non - evolving clusters .",
    "they found that this cluster model predicts @xmath11 times more arcs in a low - density , spatially flat universe ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 ) than in an einstein - de sitter universe , and that the latter model falls short by a factor of @xmath12 to explain the observed arc abundance . using a similar model ,",
    "hamana & futamase ( 1997 ) pointed out that the expected number of observed arcs increases when the evolution of the background sources is taken into account .",
    "hattori , watanabe , & yamashita ( 1997 ) included observational selection effects in a study of arc statistics using spherically symmetric cluster models .",
    "using cdm cluster models at a single redshift in an einstein - de sitter universe , van kampen ( 1996 ) studied the influence of the normalisation of the power spectrum on the number of arcs per cluster and concluded that the normalisation should be somewhat higher than derived from cluster abundance .",
    "we use two different sets of cluster simulations .",
    "a first set of five clusters is taken from high - resolution cosmological simulations kindly made available by the gif collaboration , and a second set of four clusters was simulated for the purpose of studying cluster mass profiles in different cosmologies .",
    "different numerical techniques were used for the two simulation sets .",
    "they have in common that within each set , the same random phases are used for the initial density field in all cosmological models studied , so that the clusters can be compared individually .",
    "the normalisation of the power spectra agrees approximately with the normalisation to the local cluster number density .",
    "apart from improved statistics , the approach using two differently simulated cluster sets allows us to test whether different numerical techniques yield different results for arc statistics .",
    "although the normalisations for the two simulation sets are slightly different , the arc statistics obtained from the two sets individually agree well with each other .",
    "the clusters show density profiles @xmath13 that are well fitted by the two - parameter function suggested by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) , @xmath14 navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) introduced the concentration parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radius enclosing an average overdensity of 200 times the cosmic background density . at @xmath17 , we find @xmath18 the different values for @xmath19 reflect the different cluster formation times .",
    "when clusters form earlier , their concentration is higher .",
    "the gif project is a joint effort of astrophysicists from germany and israel .",
    "its primary goal is to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological context using semi - analytical galaxy formation models embedded in large high - resolution @xmath20-body simulations .",
    "this is done by constructing merger trees of particle haloes from dark - matter only simulations and placing galaxies into them using a phenomenological modelling ( for a detailed description of this procedure as well as results cf .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "1997 ) . in order to achieve both good statistics and an accurate treatment of early epochs ,",
    "high resolution simulations are needed which nevertheless contain a fair sample of the universe , thus accounting correctly for the influence of large - scale structure on galaxy formation .",
    "those characteristics also make these simulations suitable for the present project .",
    "the code used for the gif simulations is called hydra .",
    "it is a parallel adaptive particle - particle particle - mesh ( ap@xmath21 m ) code ( for details on the code cf .",
    "couchman , thomas , & pearce 1995 ; pearce & couchman 1997 ) .",
    "the current version was developed as part of the virgo supercomputing project and was kindly made available by them for the gif project .",
    "the simulations were started on the cray t3d at the computer centre of the max - planck society in garching ( rzg ) on 128 processors .",
    "once the clustering strength required an even larger amount of total memory , they were transferred to the t3d at the edinburgh parallel computer centre ( epcc ) and finished on 256 processors .",
    "a set of four simulations with @xmath22 and with different cosmological parameters was run .",
    "apart from the fiducial cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , denoted scdm , which has @xmath0 and @xmath23 @xmath24 . ] , another @xmath0 and @xmath23 model was run ( @xmath2cdm ) which has the same shape parameter for the power spectrum , @xmath25 , as the remaining two models .",
    "those are both models with @xmath3 , the first one being a flat model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm , @xmath5 , @xmath26 ) , and the last model being an open model ( ocdm , @xmath1 , @xmath26 ) . the case of the @xmath2cdm model is particularly interesting because it shares the @xmath0 dynamics with the scdm model , but has a power spectrum with the same shape parameter as the two low-@xmath27 models .",
    "a value of @xmath25 is usually preferred by analyses of galaxy clustering , cf .",
    "peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) .",
    "this is achieved in the @xmath2cdm model despite @xmath0 and @xmath23 by assuming that a massive neutrino ( usually taken to be the @xmath2 neutrino ) had existed during the very early evolution of the universe .",
    "it must have decayed later , thus shifting the epoch when matter started to dominate over radiation in the universe , and the neutrino mass and lifetime are chosen such that @xmath25 . for a detailed description of such a model see white , gelmini , & silk ( 1995 ) .",
    "the gif simulations adopt the power spectrum @xmath28^{\\nu}]^{2/\\nu}}\\ , \\label{eq:2.1}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 ( bond & efstathiou 1984 ) . in order to completely fix @xmath30 ,",
    "the normalisation , @xmath31 , has to be chosen .",
    "this can be done on the basis of measurements of the microwave background anisotropies by the cobe satellite .",
    "however , this approach suffers from the fact that cobe measured fluctuations on scales much larger than those pertinent to the simulations .",
    "hence , one has to assume that there is no additional physics that could alter the result like , e.g. , gravitational waves or a slight tilt of the initial spectrum away from the scale - invariant form .",
    "the approach taken here avoids this problem .",
    "the mass function of objects in the universe is very steep at the high - mass end . in other words , massive objects ( like clusters of galaxies ) are not only rare , but their _ abundance _ sensitively depends on the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "white , efstathiou , & frenk ( 1993 ) introduced this way of fixing the amplitude by determining @xmath32 , the square root of the variance of the density field smoothed over @xmath33mpc spheres , such that the observed abundance of rich clusters is matched .",
    "they used the cluster mass function .",
    "recent studies of the cluster x - ray temperature function ( eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ) find similar results .",
    "for the low - density gif simulations , the result by eke et al .",

    "the initial density fields for the different cosmologies share the same random phases .      the second cluster sample is simulated using a special multi - mass technique which is explained in detail in huss , jain , & steinmetz ( 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast to the gif simulations , this technique gives only one massive cluster per run .",
    "however , it allows one to study the evolution of one individual cluster without the need for extensive computer resources .",
    "the essential part of the multi - mass technique is the initial particle arrangement .",

    "this is done in the following way .",
    "first , a pre - simulation is performed by filling the whole simulation box with particles of the same mass as those in the second layer . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the cluster - like objects are identified using a special group - finding algorithm ( huss et al .",
    "the particles finally forming these objects define the corresponding overdense region at the initial redshift .",
    "the final starting configuration is then centred on one of these regions . by adding small scale power to such a density peak , the clustering properties of the region can be changed .",
    "hence , it is possible that the simulation finally arrives at several low - mass objects rather than at one massive halo .",
    "this can be avoided by testing the clustering properties using the zeldovich approximation . when propagated to low redshifts with this technique ,",
    "the particles in the central sphere must form a distinct matter accumulation in the centre rather than showing only filamentary structure .    with this procedure ,",
    "four suitable overdense regions are identified in the scdm2 model . for the @xmath4cdm2 and for the ocdm2 clusters ,",
    "the starting configurations are centred on the same regions as for the scdm2 clusters .",
    "this is possible since the clustering properties are defined mainly by the local realisation of the random field , which is the same for all three models .",
    "however , the final cluster haloes need not represent the most massive clusters in the simulation box .",
    "our method to investigate the arc - formation statistics of the numerical cluster models was described in detail by bartelmann & weiss ( 1994 ) . we will therefore keep the present description brief and refer the reader to that paper for further information . for general information on gravitational lensing ,",
    "see schneider , ehlers , & falco ( 1992 ) or narayan & bartelmann ( 1997 ) , and references therein .",
    "the numerical cluster models yield the spatial coordinates and velocities of discrete particles with equal mass . in order to use them for gravitational lensing , we need to compute the surface mass density distribution of each cluster model in each of the three independent directions of projection .",
    "the mass density is first determined by sorting the particles into a three - dimensional grid and subsequently smoothing with a gaussian filter function .",
    "the grid resolution and the width of the gaussian are adapted to the numerical resolution of the @xmath20-body codes in order not to lose spatial resolution by the smoothing of the density field . the smoothed density field",
    "is then projected onto the three sides of the computation volume to obtain three surface - density fields for each cluster .",
    "the physical surface mass density fields are then scaled by the critical surface mass density for lensing , which apart from the cosmological parameters depends on the cluster- and source redshifts .",
    "we keep the redshift for all sources fixed at @xmath50 , and the clusters are at @xmath51 .",
    "this finally yields three two - dimensional convergence fields @xmath52 for each cluster model at redshift @xmath53 . from @xmath54 ,",
    "all quantities determining the local lens mapping , i.e. , the deflection angle and its spatial derivatives , can be computed .",
    "we determine the lens properties of the clusters on grids with an angular resolution of @xmath55 in the lens plane in order to ensure that lensed images be properly resolved .",
    "sources are then distributed on a regular grid in the source plane .",
    "the resolution of this source grid can be kept low close to the field boundaries because there no large arcs occur .",
    "close to the caustics of the clusters , where the large arcs are formed , the source - grid resolution is increased with the increasing strength of the lens . for our later purpose of statistics ,",
    "sources are weighted with the inverse resolution of the grid on which they are placed .",
    "the sources are taken to be intrinsically randomly oriented ellipses with their axis ratios drawn randomly from the interval @xmath56 $ ] , and their axes determined such that their area equals that of circles with radius @xmath57 .",
    "although this choice of source properties appears fairly simple , it should not affect the arc statistics because these mainly reflect the local properties of the lens mapping , which are independent of the particular choice of source size or ellipticity distribution .",
    "we checked that a change in average source size did not change the results .",
    "the sources are then viewed through the cluster lenses .",
    "all images are classified in the way detailed by bartelmann & weiss ( 1994 ) . among other things , the classification yields for each image its length @xmath46 , its width @xmath58 , and its curvature radius @xmath59 . in total",
    ", we classify the images of about @xmath60 sources .    knowing the area covered by the cluster fields , and having determined the frequency of occurrence of image properties such as a given length , width , and curvature radius",
    ", we can compute cross sections @xmath61 for the formation of images with such properties .",
    "the arc cross section of a cluster is defined as the area in the _ source plane _ within which a source has to lie in order to be imaged as an arc .",
    "we mostly focus on cross sections for the length - to - width ratio @xmath62 of arcs .",
    "apart from the image properties , the cross sections depend on redshift , @xmath63 .    given cross sections @xmath64 , we compute the optical depth @xmath2 for the formation of large arcs . the optical depth is the fraction of the entire source plane which is covered by cluster cross sections , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the present cluster number density , @xmath67 is the angular - diameter distance to the source plane , and @xmath68 is the proper volume of a spherical shell of width @xmath69 about @xmath70 .",
    "the factor @xmath71 accounts for the cosmological expansion factor .",

    "[ sec:3 ] , we first calculate cross sections for each individual model cluster , projected in each of the three independent spatial directions . interpolating in redshift between the redshifts of the model clusters , this yields cross sections @xmath64 as a function of redshift .",
    "we then average these cross sections ( 1 ) over the three projection directions and ( 2 ) over all model clusters within a given cosmological model .",
    "we thus obtain cross sections for the four cosmological models .",
    "figure [ fig:4.1 ] shows an example , the cross sections for arcs with length - to - width ratio @xmath72 .",

    "cross sections for other , large values of the length - to - width ratio @xmath62 , or for large arc lengths , show a qualitatively similar behaviour .",

    "we emphasise that these results are independent of whether our cluster samples are in any sense _ complete _ or not , because the simulations are designed such that the clusters can be compared individually .",
    "our conclusions do , however , rest on the assumption that the simulated clusters are _ typical _ for the clusters with the largest mass in each of the cosmological models .",
    "we believe that this is guaranteed by the large size of the cosmological simulation volumes from which the clusters were taken .",
    "it is a combination of effects that leads to the large difference in arc optical depth across the cosmological models that we have investigated .",
    "( i ) clusters form earlier in low - density than in high - density universes . in scdm ,",
    "normalised to the cluster abundance , the formation of such clusters which would in principle be massive enough for strong lensing is delayed to such low redshifts that they fail to be efficient lenses for sources at redshifts @xmath89 .",
    "( ii ) for low - density universes , the proper volume per unit redshift is larger than for high - density universes . given the observed number density of clusters today , this volume effect increases the number of clusters between the source sphere and the observer when @xmath27 is small .",
    "( iii ) clusters that form early are more concentrated than clusters that form late .",
    "clusters in low - density universes therefore reach higher central surface mass densities than clusters in high - density universes .",
    "( iv ) strong gravitational lensing is a highly non - linear effect .",
    "this is because the arc cross section of a cluster sensitively depends on the length of the caustic curve and the number of cusp points contained in it .",
    "the properties of the caustic curve do not only depend on the surface mass density , but also on the tidal field of a cluster , which is influenced by the cluster morphology .",
    "( v ) because of ( iv ) , asymmetric clusters are much more efficient in producing large arcs than symmetric clusters ( bartelmann et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the degree of substructure of a cluster is therefore very important for arc statistics .",
    "while clusters are in the process of formation , they are expected to be highly asymmetric .",
    "if this happens at redshifts where lensing is efficient for a given source population , the asymmetric cluster morphology further increases the strong - lensing cross section .",
    "most clusters in ocdm and @xmath4cdm form at @xmath90 , exactly where lensing is most efficient for sources at @xmath8 .",
    "clusters in scdm and @xmath2cdm form later , at @xmath91 , where their lensing efficiency and that of their sublumps is already suppressed by the lensing geometry .",
    "although clusters in s/@xmath2cdm form later than in o/@xmath4cdm and should therefore be more asymmetric , the sublumps in o/@xmath4cdm clusters are more compact and thus tend to persist for a longer time after merging with the cluster .      a simple press - schechter type argument illustrates the influence of formation time and cosmic volume . according to press & schechter ( 1974 ) , the ( comoving ) fraction of the cosmic matter that is contained in clusters is @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 the variance of the density contrast on cluster scales today , and @xmath95 the ( cosmology - dependent ) linear growth factor of density perturbations .",
    "the cluster fraction at redshift @xmath70 , normalised to the present cluster fraction , provides an estimate for the change in cluster number density with redshift .",
    "multiplying with the proper cosmic volume @xmath96 of a shell of width @xmath69 and the squared effective lensing distance @xmath97 yields an estimate for the number of efficient lensing clusters per redshift interval , @xmath98 because the cross section per cluster should scale approximately with @xmath99 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1 ] for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , with @xmath1 .",
    "of course , this simple estimate completely neglects the influence of the change in cluster concentration across the cosmological models , and the non - linearities of the strong lensing effect .",
    "however , it suffices to demonstrate that large differences in the arc cross section are expected between high- and low - density universes .",
    "all cosmological simulation volumes from which we have taken the cluster models are of order a few times @xmath100 .",
    "since the cluster mass function is very steep , we are therefore likely to miss the most massive clusters . in order to estimate their influence on the arc cross sections ,",
    "we have repeated the arc simulations for scdm with surface - mass densities rescaled to higher cluster mass .",
    "let @xmath101 and @xmath102 be the original and rescaled cluster masses , respectively .",
    "then , we take @xmath103 \\label{eq:5.3}\\ ] ] for the rescaled surface - mass density and compute the arc cross section from that . in effect , we calculate the arc cross section @xmath104 of a cluster of similar structure as the original one , but with higher total mass . for each cluster model at redshift @xmath53 , we then average the arc cross sections over mass , weighted by the press - schechter cluster mass function @xmath105 , @xmath106 finally , we compute mass - averaged optical depths @xmath107 by substituting @xmath108 for @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath107 differs from @xmath2 only by 10 - 15 per cent .",
    "although the arc cross section is a fairly steep function of mass , the increase in @xmath61 is more than compensated by the steep decrease of the cluster mass function .",
    "for example , quadrupling the masses of the @xmath2cdm clusters increases the averaged cross section for arcs with @xmath87 by about two orders of magnitude , but decreases the cluster mass function by about three orders of magnitude , almost completely cancelling the effect of the larger arc cross section . for clusters in the other cosmological models ,",
    "the change in the optical depth should be smaller than that in @xmath2cdm .",
    "clusters with higher masses than those contained in our sample can therefore safely be neglected .",
    "we have only studied the most massive clusters found in each cosmological simulation .",
    "even then , the least massive clusters in each sample contribute little or nothing to the arc optical depth .",
    "extending our samples by including less massive clusters would therefore change the arc optical depth negligibly or not at all .",
    "since we select the most massive clusters at redshift zero and study their progenitors , it could be that at higher redshift other clusters in the cosmological simulations would be more massive .",
    "in other words , it is not immediately clear that the progenitors of the most massive clusters are also the most massive clusters present at higher redshift . in order to test that",
    ", we selected the @xmath2cdm model , where clusters form at the lowest redshifts , and checked whether the progenitors of the our sample of the five most massive clusters is identical with the sample of the five most massive clusters at the redshifts relevant for lensing .",
    "this turned out to be the case .",
    "in the other models , where clusters form at higher redshifts , possible misidentifications are even less likely than in @xmath2cdm .    given these results , we are confident that our cluster samples fairly reflect those clusters that dominate the optical depth for the formation of large arcs .",
    "so can we constrain cosmological parameters through arc statistics ? for that , we would have to compare the number of observed arcs to that predicted by our models .",
    "this comparison is hampered by the fact that there is no complete sample of observed clusters selected by _",
    "mass _ , as it should be for a fair comparison .",
    "there is one cluster sample , however , whose definition comes close to this criterion , namely the emss sample of x - ray bright clusters , for which the x - ray luminosity in the emss energy band is @xmath110 ( @xmath23 , @xmath111 ) .",
    "the number density of such clusters is estimated to be @xmath112 ( le fvre et al.1994 ) .",
    "arc surveys in this sample have shown that the number of arcs with @xmath87 and a limiting magnitude of @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ; these are the arc criteria set up by wu & hammer 1993 ) is roughly @xmath115 per cluster ( le fvre et al .  1994 ; gioia & luppino 1994 ) .    clusters with @xmath116",
    "should be fairly represented by the massive simulated clusters in our samples .",
    "having velocity dispersions @xmath117 , the empirical relation between velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity obtained by quintana & melnick ( 1982 ) implies x - ray luminosities in the right range .",
    "we can therefore assume that the arc cross sections of our simulated clusters are typical for x - ray luminous clusters in the emss survey .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.3 ] give @xmath118 . using the number density of bright emss clusters given above , @xmath119 since the whole sky has @xmath120 square degrees , the total solid angle in which sources at @xmath8 are imaged as large arcs with @xmath87 is @xmath121 the sources which are imaged as arcs with the above properties , @xmath87 and @xmath122 correspond to sources with @xmath123 because of the magnification .",
    "taking the number densities compiled and measured by smail et al . , there are @xmath124 such sources per square degree .",
    "the average redshift of such sources is @xmath125 ( e.g.  lilly et al .",
    "since the average arc - cluster redshift in our models is at @xmath126 , the exact redshift of sources at @xmath127 has only very little influence ; the critical surface mass density changes by @xmath128 when sources are shifted from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "it follows that the number of such arcs on the whole sky expected from our simulations is @xmath131 there are @xmath132 clusters on the sky which match the criteria of the emss bright cluster sample ( le fvre et al .",
    "taking the number of arcs per cluster found in the emss clusters , the expected number of arcs on the whole sky is @xmath133 . despite the obvious uncertainties in this estimate , _ the only of our cosmological models for which the expected number of arcs comes near the observed number is the open cdm model_. the others fail by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "the large differences in arc optical depth between the cosmological models investigated makes this result fairly insensitive to moderate uncertainties .",
    "it therefore appears fair to conclude that arc statistics in the framework of cluster - normalised cdm models demands that @xmath27 is low , and that @xmath35 is small .",
    "conversely , if @xmath7 , clusters have to form earlier than in our models .",
    "we estimate with the simple press - schechter approach sketched above that in order to achieve that , @xmath134 would be necessary in the scdm case .",
    "we have neglected the potential influence of cd galaxies or cooling flows on the arc cross sections that could increase the central surface mass densities of the clusters and thus also their arc cross sections .",
    "most probably , this influence is small compared to the huge differences between the cosmological models .",
    "nonetheless , we will study this issue in detail in a further paper because individual cluster galaxies may well affect arc morphologies , if not their total number .",
    "we have benefited from many instructive discussions , particularly with suvendra dutta , gus evrard , eelco van kampen , shude mao , houjun mo , julio navarro , peter schneider , and simon white .",
    "matthias steinmetz and achim weiss contributed a lot to the numerical code which we used to automatically classify the arcs .",
