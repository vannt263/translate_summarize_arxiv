    "in quantum mechanics , boundary conditions play an important role .",
    "a good example is casimir force @xcite predicted in 1948 .",
    "it is also known that boundary conditions produce force in non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . in this paper , we focus on one - dimensional free particles and show that this force leads to equations of state whose one - dimensional volume or length dependence is the same as that of van der waals equation of state .    consider a closed box",
    ". one may impose the conventional dirichlet condition on wave functions at the walls of the box . in mathematics , we are , however , permitted to generalize the boundary condition in the context of self - adjoint extensions of hamiltonian operators @xcite , where the dirichlet and neumann conditions are allowed just as special boundary conditions .",
    "interestingly , it has been pointed out @xcite that the generalized boundary conditions can be derived from the vanishing limits of widths of two step functions , which may be realized at , for example , junctions of two semiconductor layers . in this paper , we consider the dirichlet condition and a class of boundary conditions including the neumann condition , which we call quasi - neumann conditions , to find how boundary conditions affect the physical property of the particles in the box .",
    "we show that such boundary conditions affect statistical quantities of finite size systems .",
    "note that this effect has no relation with bulk properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit , where the effect that we will obtain disappears .",
    "specifically , we approximately calculate the spectra of particles in the box by integral approximation and find that the spectra can lead to equations of state having the same dependence on length as van der waals equation of state .",
    "van der waals equation was introduced by johannes diderik van der waals in his ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite and has been well - known to describe the behavior of real fluids .",
    "van der waals - like equations of state were derived from , for example , the gaussian markoffian process @xcite , the intermolecular interaction in classical statistical mechanics @xcite , the wall - molecular interaction in classical statistical mechanics @xcite , or the electro - magnetic field @xcite . unlike van der waals equation of state ,",
    "our equations of state tend to that for ideal gas in the thermodynamic limit . in finite size system ,",
    "the quantum boundary effects lead to similar equations of state as the above - mentioned effects .",
    "the free particles under the dirichlet condition @xcite and cyclic boundary condition @xcite have been studied earlier , and here we consider combinations of the non - trivial boundary conditions and show that they admit equations of state whose length dependence is the same as that of van der waals equation of state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the method of self - adjoint extensions to characterize the possible boundary conditions . in section 3 ,",
    "we study free particles in a one - dimensional box with the dirichlet condition at its one wall and a quasi - neumann condition at the other wall ( see the left one of fig.[fig : boxes ] ) .",
    "we consider three types of statistics : maxwell - boltzmann statistics , bose - einstein statistics , and fermi - dirac statistics , for which equations of state are obtained . in section 4 , we study * free particles in * free particles in a one - dimensional box with identical boundary conditions at its both walls ( see the right one of fig.[fig : boxes ] ) , where we assume maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "in addition , we extend the one - dimensional box with identical quasi - neumann conditions at both of the walls to a three - dimensional one . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the physical meanings on the outcomes .",

    "the sign change of the boundary parameter is caused by reversing the direction where the particles collide on the wall .",
    "the wave functions are given by three the types : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 satisfy following quantization conditions : @xmath126 the approximation ( [ eq : aproximation1 ] ) and @xmath127\\label{eq : aproximation2}\\\\ \\tanh x & = x   + o \\big [ x ^3 \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lead to energy spectrum of each particle as @xmath128 where @xmath40 . by using equation ( [ eq : integral_approximation_of_integer ] ) ,",
    "we obtain partition function @xmath129 as follows : @xmath130 let force acting on the wall be @xmath131 .",
    "an equation of state in this case is given by @xmath132 we call the term @xmath133 a force correction term and the term @xmath134 a length correction term . note that @xmath135 implies the neumann condition .",
    "let @xmath136 be force under the pair of the neumann conditions , the equation of state is given by @xmath137 the above equation is different from the equation of the pair of the dirichlet conditions ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_d - d ] ) .      here , we study a three - dimensional box with a quasi - neumann condition at the wall of box .",
    "let @xmath138 be a three - dimensional cartesian coordinate .",
    "consider a cuboid box whose median point is the origin of the coordinate .",
    "let its sides be parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "we introduce @xmath139 , and @xmath140 as the lengths of the sides .",
    "as is the previous section , we impose identical boundary conditions at the walls of the box : the boundary condition at @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are characterized by @xmath30 and the boundary condition at @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 are characterized by @xmath121 .",
    "we introduce quantum numbers for @xmath147 , @xmath81 , and @xmath148 directions as @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , which characterize energy of a particle , @xmath152 , as @xmath153 the energy implies that force is different by the directions .",
    "we introduce @xmath154 as force of the @xmath147 direction , the equation of state is given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the force of the other directions is obtained by the same calculation .",
    "note that the terms showing the aeolotropic behavior of pressure vanish in the thermodynamic limit @xmath158 under the constant density condition , @xmath159  constant .",
    "the equation of state ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_3d ] ) thus predicts no aeolotropic bulk gas but shows the dependence of boundary effects on the scale of the system .",
    "we studied free particles in a closed box whose boundary conditions are generalized by self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian .",
    "we solved the energy spectrum conditions approximately and obtained the equations of state from the energy spectra by integral approximation .",
    "note that our results are significant primarily for finite size systems since the boundary effects disappear in the thermodynamic limit ; therefore , our equations of state do not describe the bulk properties of free particles at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we assume three different combinations of the boundary conditions .",
    "first , we considered the one - dimensional box with the dirichlet condition and a quasi - neumann condition .",
    "we assumed three types of statistics : maxwell - boltzmann , bose - einstein , and fermi - dirac statistics , and obtained the equations of state ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_n - d ] ) and ( [ eq : quantum_equation_of_state_at_d - n ] ) and evaluated the behavior of the equations in the limit @xmath90 , arriving at ( [ eq : lim_of_classical_equation_of_state ] ) , ( [ eq : lim_of_bose_equation_of_state ] ) , and ( [ eq : lim_of_fermi_equation_of_state ] ) .",
    "although these five equations are different in statistics and in the region of @xmath0 , they share the same force correction terms .",
    "the common force correction terms have the same dependence on length as that of van der waals equation .",
    "the force correction terms are dependent on the boundary parameter , whereas other terms are independent .",
    "second , we studied maxwell - boltzmann particles under the dirichlet condition at both of the walls .",
    "we found that the equation of state ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_d - d ] ) is no longer that of ideal gas due to the length correction term in ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_d - d ] ) , which is different from that of van der waals equation of state ( [ eq : vdw_equation_of_state ] ) .",
    "it has been studied in @xcite that there is a difference between two pressures , one of which obtained under the pair of the dirichlet conditions and the other evaluated under the pair of the dirichlet and the neumann conditions .",
    "the equations of state of ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_n - d ] ) and ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_d - d ] ) lead to the high temperature limit of the pressure difference ( [ eq : tsutsui_pressure ] ) , which is an increasing function of temperature and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "third , we studied particles obeying maxwell - boltzmann statistics under a quasi neumann condition at both of the walls .",
    "we obtained the equation of state ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_n - n ] ) , which has both the length correction term and the force correction term .",
    "the strength of the force correction term in this case is twice of that of the pair of the dirichlet condition and a quasi neumann condition .",
    "the length correction term in this case is similar to that of the pair of the dirichlet conditions except for its sign .",
    "note that the equation of the pair of the neumann conditions ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_2n ] ) is different from that of the pair of the dirichlet conditions .",
    "these three results clearly show that boundary conditions can yield force correction terms that have inverse square dependence on the length , analogously to van der waals equation . however , the force correction term in van der waals equation and those of our equations are different in particle number dependence .",
    "our equations of state are influenced by boundary effects which vanish in the thermodynamic limit , and hence they are meaningful only in the finite length system . in the case of van der waals equation , the order @xmath68 is regarded as the number of the inter - molecular interactions , which is @xmath160 since the @xmath57 particles interact with each other . on the other hand , the force correction term of the pair of the dirichlet condition and a quasi neumann condition is in proportion to @xmath57 and that of the pair of quasi neumann conditions is twice of that of the pair of the dirichlet condition and a quasi neumann condition .",
    "there is no force correction term in the equation of state of the pair of the dirichlet conditions .",
    "interestingly , the product of the particle number and the number of the walls of a quasi neumann condition equals the dependence of the particle number of the force correction terms in our model .",
    "this implies that the particle number dependence can be interpreted as the number of the interactions , as in the case with van der waals equation .",
    "we also briefly touched upon the three - dimensional box with a quasi - neumann condition .",
    "the obtained equation of state ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_3d ] ) is a three - dimensional extension of the one - dimensional equation ( [ eq : classical_equation_of_state_at_n - n ] ) and we find that the three - dimensional equation possesses the same property of the one - dimensional equation , confirming that boundary effects can appear in three dimensions , too .",
    "finally , we mention that generalized boundary conditions have been used for effective descriptions of rapidly varying potentials at small scales , which are approximately represented by the vanishing limit of widths of step functions @xcite . there ,",
    "the boundary condition ( 2.7 ) and parameter @xmath30 are derived from such limits of two step functions @xcite .",
    "these circumstances may appear , for instance , at junctions of two semiconductor layers and , if so , our boundary effects may actually be observed experimentally .",

    "in this appendix , we give a brief account of integral approximation of the sum of series . for all @xmath161",
    ", @xmath162 can be expanded as @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "we obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 we apply the above equation to @xmath167 and eliminate the differential term by successive iteration , then we obtain the following series expansion : @xmath168 where @xmath169 the coefficient @xmath170 tends to @xmath10 rapidly in the limit @xmath171 . in addition , @xmath172 in our system ; therefore @xmath173.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above equations , then we can neglect the sum of the first term of the right hand side of ( [ eq : integral_approximation_of_one_half ] ) if @xmath174 .",
    "now , we show a similar formula to ( [ eq : integral_approximation_of_one_half ] ) . let f(x ) expand as follows : @xmath175 we define @xmath176 and repeat the above discussion , then the following equation is obtained : @xmath177 where @xmath178",
