    "su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory , with the higgs field in the adjoint representation , possesses globally regular gravitating magnetic monopole solutions and corresponding magnetically charged black hole solutions @xcite . for small gravitational constant ,",
    "the gravitating fundamental monopole solution smoothly emerges from the corresponding flat space solution , the t hooft - polyakov monopole @xcite . with increasing gravitational constant ,",
    "the mass of the gravitating fundamental monopole solution decreases , and it ceases to exist beyond a maximal value of the gravitational constant .    the corresponding magnetically charged eymh black hole solutions represent counterexamples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture .",
    "distinct from embedded reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes with unit magnetic charge , they emerge from the globally regular magnetic monopole solutions when a finite regular event horizon is imposed .",
    "consequently , they have been characterized as `` black holes within magnetic monopoles '' @xcite .",
    "besides the fundamental monopole solution there are excited monopole solutions @xcite . the gauge field function of the @xmath0-th excited monopole solution possesses @xmath0 nodes , whereas the gauge field function of the fundamental monopole solution decreases monotonically to zero @xcite .",
    "the excited monopole solutions are related to the globally regular einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) solutions , found by bartnik and mckinnon @xcite , and , like these solutions , have no flat space counterparts .",
    "in flat space also dyon solutions exist , carrying both electric and magnetic charge @xcite . here",
    "we show that , like the monopole solutions , these dyon solutions persist in the presence of gravity , up to some maximal value of the gravitational constant . beside the fundamental gravitating dyon solutions , we also construct excited gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic black hole solutions .",
    "distinct from the embedded rn solutions with the same electric and magnetic charge , these `` black holes within dyons '' again represent counterexamples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture .",
    "in contrast , pure su(2 ) eym theory possesses neither regular dyon solutions @xcite , nor dyonic black holes other than embedded rn solutions @xcite .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) eymh action @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 is the gauge coupling constant , @xmath7 is the higgs coupling constant and @xmath8 is the higgs field vacuum expectation value .",
    "variation of the action eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath9 , the gauge field @xmath10 and the higgs field @xmath11 leads to the einstein equations and the matter field equations .    to construct static",
    "spherically symmetric globally regular and black hole solutions we employ schwarzschild - like coordinates and adopt the spherically symmetric metric @xmath12 with @xmath13 for the gauge and higgs field we employ the spherically symmetric ansatz @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 with unit vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , gravitating monopole solutions are obtained @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath21 and the dimensionless mass function @xmath22 , @xmath23 as well as the coupling constants @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26    the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the einstein equations then yield the equations for the metric functions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath21 . for the matter functions we obtain the equations @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33    a special solution of these equations is the embedded rn solution with mass @xmath34 , unit magnetic charge and arbitrary electric charge @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 the corresponding extremal rn solution has horizon @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    "let us first consider the globally regular particle - like solutions of the su(2 ) eymh system . requiring asymptotically flat solutions implies that the metric functions @xmath40 and @xmath22 both approach a constant at infinity .",
    "we here adopt @xmath41 and @xmath42 represents the dimensionless mass of the solutions .",
    "the matter functions also approach constants asymptotically , @xmath43 where for magnetic monopole solutions @xmath44 .",
    "the asymptotic fall - off of the function @xmath45 determines the dimensionless electric charge @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) .",
    "regularity of the solutions at the origin requires @xmath46 and @xcite @xmath47    the globally regular dyon solutions have many features in common with the globally regular monopole solutions . in the prasad - sommerfield limit , @xmath48 ,",
    "the dyon solutions in flat space are known analytically @xcite , whereas for finite @xmath25 they are obtained numerically @xcite . in the presence of gravity ,",
    "the corresponding gravitating dyon solutions extend up to a maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath24 . beyond this value",
    "no dyon solutions exist . for small values of @xmath25",
    ", the fundamental dyon branch does not end at the maximal value @xmath49 .",
    "instead it exhibits a small spike there and bends backwards , up to the critical coupling constant @xmath50 . since variation of the coupling constant @xmath51",
    "can be considered in two different ways , either as changing @xmath52 and keeping @xmath8 fixed , or vice versa , for small @xmath25 the fundamental dyon branch can be interpreted as obtained by first varying @xmath52 up to the maximal value @xmath49 , and then varying @xmath8 up to the critical value @xmath50 .    at the critical value",
    "@xmath50 the fundamental dyon branch reaches a limiting solution and bifurcates with the branch of extremal rn solutions of unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath35 .",
    "the fundamental dyon branch is thus completely analogous to the fundamental monopole branch @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated for the normalized mass @xmath53 of the dyon solutions with electric charge @xmath54 and @xmath48 in fig .  1 , where for comparison also the monopole solutions ( @xmath55 , @xmath48 ) are shown , together with the extremal rn solutions of unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath54 as well as @xmath55 .",
    "the normalization in fig .  1 is chosen to obtain the finite mass of the flat space solutions in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "the adm mass @xmath57 can be read off the figure . for the dyon branch",
    "we find a critical coupling of @xmath58 , while for the monopole branch it is @xmath59 @xcite .    along the fundamental branch",
    "the dyon functions approach limiting functions , when @xmath60 . as for the monopole solutions , the metric function @xmath61 of the dyon solutions develops a minimum , which decreases monotonically along the fundamental branch . in the limit @xmath60 , the minimum approaches zero at @xmath62 .",
    "the limiting metric function then consists of an inner part , @xmath63 , and an outer part , @xmath64 . for @xmath64",
    ", the limiting metric function corresponds to the metric function @xmath61 of the extremal rn black hole with @xmath50 , unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath35 .",
    "likewise the other functions approach limiting functions , when @xmath60 , which for @xmath64 correspond to those of the extremal rn black hole with @xmath50 , unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath35 .",
    "the limit @xmath60 is demonstrated in fig .  2 for the matter function @xmath45 of the dyon solution with electric charge @xmath54 and @xmath48 .",
    "in the figure the occurrence of the spike is seen , since the function @xmath45 does not reach the limiting function at the maximal value @xmath49 , but instead at the critical value @xmath50 .",
    "the limiting function is identically zero for @xmath63 and coincides with the rn function for @xmath64 .",
    "the limiting behaviour of the other functions of the dyon solutions is analogous to those of the monopole solutions , shown in @xcite .    beside the branch of fundamental dyon solutions",
    "there are branches of excited dyon solutions .",
    "the gauge field function @xmath65 of the @xmath0-th excited dyon solution has @xmath0 nodes , whereas the gauge field function of the fundamental dyon solution decreases monotonically to zero .",
    "the excited dyon solutions also exist only below some maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "since these excited solutions have no flat space counterparts , the variation of @xmath24 along a branch of excited solutions must be interpreted as a variation of @xmath8 while @xmath52 is kept fixed . in the limit @xmath56",
    "the higgs field vacuum expectation value therefore vanishes , while @xmath52 remains finite . because of the particular choice of dimensionless variables ( [ xm ] ) , in this limit",
    "the solutions shrink to zero size and their mass @xmath22 diverges .",
    "the coordinate transformation @xmath66 @xcite leads to finite limiting solutions in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the transformed excited monopole solutions approach the bartnik - mckinnon solutions @xcite , and so do the transformed excited dyon solutions .",
    "this is seen in fig .  3 , where we show the appropriately normalized mass @xmath67 as a function of @xmath24 for the first excited dyon branch with electric charge @xmath54 and @xmath48 .",
    "for comparison also the first excited monopole branch is shown .",
    "further details will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the dyonic black hole solutions of the su(2 ) eymh system . imposing again the condition of asymptotic flatness , the black hole solutions satisfy the same boundary conditions at infinity as the regular solutions .",
    "the existence of a regular event horizon at @xmath38 requires @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the matter functions must satisfy @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72    again , the su(2 ) eymh `` black holes within dyons '' have many features in common with the `` black holes within monopoles '' .",
    "in particular , for a given coupling constant @xmath24 , the black hole solutions corresponding to the fundamental dyon branch emerge from the globally regular solution in the limit @xmath73 and persist up to a critical maximal value of the horizon radius . in fig .  4 we exhibit the mass of `` black holes within dyons '' with electric charge @xmath54 and @xmath48 as a function of the horizon radius for several values of @xmath24 , together with the corresponding branches of rn solutions of unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath54 .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath24 , the black hole solutions merge into non - extremal rn solutions at a critical value of the horizon radius . for larger values of @xmath24 ,",
    "the black hole solutions show a critical behaviour analogous to the globally regular solutions , and bifurcate with an extremal rn solution . here , with increasing horizon radius the limiting solution is reached at a critical value of the horizon radius smaller than the horizon radius of the extremal rn black hole with the same @xmath24 , unit magnetic charge and electric charge @xmath35 .",
    "this critical behaviour is demonstrated for the function @xmath45 of the dyon black hole solutions with electric charge @xmath54 and coupling constants @xmath74 and @xmath48 in fig .",
    "further details will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the globally regular dyon solutions have many features in common with the globally regular monopole solutions . like the fundamental monopole branch ,",
    "the fundamental dyon branch starts from the corresponding flat space solution and extends up to a critical value of the coupling constant @xmath24 . at the critical value , both the fundamental monopole branch and the fundamental dyon branch bifurcate with the corresponding branch of extremal rn solutions .",
    "the critical coupling constant depends slightly on the electric charge @xmath35 of the dyons .",
    "likewise , beside the fundamental dyon branch there are branches of excited dyon solutions , which extend up to a maximal value of @xmath24 . in the limit @xmath56 , the branches of excited dyon solutions tend to the corresponding bartnik - mckinnon solutions , like their monopole counterparts .",
    "starting from the stable monopole solutions in flat space , the solutions on the fundamental monopole branch remain stable for @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the classical dyon solution in flat space is unstable , since the mass can be lowered continuously , by lowering the electric charge , as long as there is no charge quantization @xcite .",
    "this indicates , that the gravitating fundamental dyon solutions are also unstable .    in analogy to `` black holes within monopoles ''",
    "also `` black holes within dyons '' exist . for a given value of the coupling constant @xmath24 , the `` black holes within dyons '' emerge from the globally regular solutions in the limit @xmath73 and persist up to a maximal value of the horizon radius . for small @xmath24",
    "the black hole solutions merge into the corresponding non - extremal rn solutions at a critical value of the horizon radius , whereas for larger @xmath24 ( but @xmath76 ) the black hole solutions bifurcate at a critical value of the horizon radius with the corresponding extremal rn solutions .",
    "the static spherically symmetric `` black holes within monopoles '' and `` black holes within dyons '' provide counterexamples to the `` no - hair conjecture '' .",
    "eymh theory also possesses counterexamples of a different type , namely static aspherical black holes , which represent `` black holes within multimonopoles '' @xcite . beside static axially symmetric black holes , whose",
    "eym counterparts have recently been obtained non ",
    "perturbatively @xcite , there are static black holes with only discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "it presents a challenge to construct such black holes with only crystal symmetries non - perturbatively .",
