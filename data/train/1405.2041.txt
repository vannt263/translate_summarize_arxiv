    "wide - field and deep multi - wavelength surveys have allowed us to study statistically large samples of galaxies at a wide range of redshifts with unprecedented detail .",
    "substantial progress in stellar population synthesis ( sps ) modeling @xcite and improved global diagnostics of galactic star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ( ke12 ) , and references within ) have enabled the determination of key physical quantities of galaxies from these data : photometric redshifts , star formation rates ( sfrs ; @xmath9 ) , stellar masses ( @xmath10 ) , dust attenuation , and stellar ages @xcite .    these advances in redshift estimation have allowed the determination of accurate rest frame colors for many of these objects , and indicate that galaxies out to high redshifts fall into two distinct groups in color - color space : `` star - forming '' ( sf ) and `` quiescent '' @xcite .",
    "new studies of physical quantities have revealed key differences between these groups , such as a strong correlation at fixed redshift between @xmath10 and @xmath9 among star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) .",
    "this sf `` main sequence '' ( ms ) generally takes the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 free parameters of the fit .",
    "@xmath12 is usually measured to be between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ( r12a ) ) , with values of @xmath16@xmath15 preferred @xcite , and both @xmath12 ( ms slope , i.e. power - law index ) and @xmath13 ( ms normalization ) likely functions of time , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "this relation is quite tight , with only @xmath20@xmath21dex of observed scatter dispersion of galaxies around the best fit ms parameters , rather than the uncertainties in the fitted parameters themselves . ]",
    "( d07 ; m10 ; w12 ) . from this point",
    "onwards we will refer to each of these studies by their abbreviation ( see also tables  [ tab : msfr_info ] and  [ tab : msfr ] ) .",
    "these studies typically find that galaxies on this sf ms formed stars at much higher rates in the distant universe than they do today : the average sfr at fixed stellar mass has decreased at a steady rate by a factor of @xmath22 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( d07 ; e07 ; w12 ; so14 ) .",
    "this has been linked to the rapid quenching of star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; m13 ) and the `` downsizing paradigm '' for galaxy evolution @xcite . in addition , sfgs in clusters , groups , and the field display similar ms relations up to @xmath25 ( although with differing quiescent fractions and overall mass distributions ) , indicating that the underlying physics governing ms evolution are relatively insensitive to environment @xcite .",
    "although there have been a host of studies of the ms in the past decade , quantitative comparisons between them have been difficult , as studies have not standardized their calibrations and methodology .",
    "differences in , e.g. , assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , luminosity - to - sfr ( @xmath26@xmath9 ) conversions , sps models , dust attenuation , and emission line contributions can lead to differences in derived stellar masses and sfrs as high as a factor of 23 ( m10 ; ke12 ; z12 ; r12a ; @xcite ) .",
    "these effects have not yet been systematically calibrated against each other , which has made it difficult to determine actual ms evolution , especially if both the normalization _ and _ slope of the ms are changing over time .",
    "for instance , while some studies have found significant evolution in ms slope as high as @xmath27 from @xmath28@xmath29 ( w12 ) , others seem to indicate little to no evolution over the same redshift range ( d09 ; k11 ; so14 ) .",
    "additionally , variation between ms slopes from various studies at a given redshift is also significant , reaching as high as @xmath30 ( e07 ; o10 ; @xcite ) , twice as large as the _ total _ evolution observed by w12 .",
    "as the slope and normalization are highly degenerate , samples that have similar overall distributions of masses and sfrs but have been selected differently can have large differences in their ms fits , leading to changes in the derived slopes by up to @xmath31 ( k11 ; w12 ) .",
    "the magnitude of these effects precludes robust interpretations of derived ms properties .",
    "the inability to directly compare observations has also made it difficult to quantify how the scatter about the ms has evolved with time . while observations out to @xmath32 find scatter to be roughly constant around @xmath33dex ( n07 ; w12 ) , the scatter observed at each median redshift has been convolved with evolution of the ms within its redshift bin , as well as with additional scatter resulting from uncertainties in stellar mass and sfr ( n07 ) .",
    "s12 are the first to attempt to account for this effect by simultaneously fitting a power - law correction as a function of redshift to their derived ms fits .",
    "this method , however , is limited by the redshift range spanned by their data ( @xmath34 ) and somewhat dependent on the chosen functional form . as a result",
    ", the evolution of the `` true '' scatter about the ms across a wide range of redshifts has not yet been thoroughly investigated .    to overcome these limitations ,",
    "interpublication comparisons have used average sfrs ( either across the whole sample or at a specific mass ) after simple imf offsets to determine the approximate evolution of the average ms galaxy s sfr , rather than the derived ms s themselves ( m10 ; z12 ) .",
    "this method has been useful in estimating the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density ( i.e. per cubic mpc ) ( csfr ) to first order @xcite",
    ". however , it averages over the observed @xmath35 relations , and so does not take into account much of the information surrounding the mass dependencies that govern the ms .    in order to directly compare ms observations against each other and so constrain ms evolution and systematic errors",
    ", we have compiled 64 ms observations from 25 studies published since 2007 , spanning @xmath28@xmath36 , and converted them to the same absolute calibrations .",
    "these have been taken from a variety of fields , selected using different methodologies , include both stacked and non - stacked data , and have sfrs determined from all methods currently available . by taking into account the different mass ranges in each study consistently , we not only accurately determine ms evolution , but also quantify the extent to which selection can affect observed ms determinations .",
    "these results allow us to determine the evolution of both the ms and the `` true '' scatter about it as a function of cosmic time .",

    "fit(s ) include more than two data points ( if stacked ) or 50 galaxies ( if directly observed)_. this requirement is mainly to avoid biases resulting from small number statistics and to enable the determination of a @xmath44 value to check the goodness of fit and thus possible variance and/or errors . 3 .",
    "_ includes the specifics of their fits , list references where such specifics may be obtained , or else provide data from which such specifics can be easily estimated . _ in order to attempt to properly calibrate ms observations against each other , we must know what specific calibrations were used for each observation .",

    "in addition , masses , sfrs , and other physical parameters are derived using a range of model parameters , which include :    * 7 different sps models / template sets , along with 2 analytical @xmath10/@xmath26 relations * 5 different parametrizations of sfhs * 7 different extinction curves , along with 3 independent observational estimates from irx observations / correlations ( m99 ; r12a ; b12 ) * assumed metallicites ranging from @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "we adjust each relation onto a common scaled based on the calibrations discussed in  [ sec : technicalities ] , which are briefly summarized here .",
    "the assumed stellar imf is converted to a kroupa imf using the conversion factors taken from z12 and the @xmath26@xmath9 relation to those taken from ke12 .",
    "differences between sps models ( e.g. , bc03 and cb07 ) are accounted for using the conversion factors from m10 and so14 .",

    "radio sfrs have been adjusted based on the @xmath52 evolution observed here using the median redshifts of each redshift bin .",
    "when necessary , we include emission line effects on the masses using the conversion factors from @xcite and adjust for differences in cosmology using our assumed @xmath37 wmap concordance cosmology @xcite and first - order volume corrections ( see  [ subsubsec : cosmology ] ) .",
    "differences between selection methods and their effects on derived ms parameters are accounted for by subdividing them using our `` bluer '' , `` mixed '' , and `` non - selective '' classifications . to reduce the impact systematic uncertainties and selection effects have in our sample",
    ", we exclude data in the first and last 2gyr of the universe where the two are most important .",
    "any other possible differences are not accounted for in this work .",
    "the calibrations and the areas they impact are briefly noted in table  [ tab : calibration ] , while their effects on the interpublication scatter and fitted ms parameters are shown in table  [ tab : error_budget ] .",
    "based on these results , we take our `` best '' sample as the combination of our applied calibration offsets and `` time edge '' cuts restricted to mixed observations only .    these data encompass a wide range of assumed inputs and observations in the literature and are a census of most of the methods available today utilized to derive ms relations .",
    "the calibrations likewise incorporate many of the most up - to - date observational evidence as well as recent advances in modelling . by combining the two , we present what we hope",
    "is the broadest and most accurate census of ms observations to date .",
    "differences in the assumptions and techniques used to derive the ms can lead to major offsets in the final derived @xmath10@xmath9 relations . as outlined in table  [ tab : msfr_info ] , every one of these has been interpreted differently by various studies , leading to substantial difficulties in comparing different ms observations .    in order to properly compare these studies , in each case an offset is developed to produce a set of calibrations and assumptions , thereby putting all studies on a common basis .",
    "we denote all calibration offsets for the ms relation outlined in this section with the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the particular attribute being adjusted for , and @xmath53 is in dex .",
    "this common basis is described in table  [ tab : calibration ] , while the impact it has on scatter between ms observations ( i.e. interpublication scatter ) is shown in table  [ tab : error_budget ] .",
    "the corresponding calibration offsets applied to each sample are listed in table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "all non - reference acronyms used both here and throughout the rest of the paper are listed in appendix  [ app : acronyms ] .    because studies have generally not released data tables containing individual objects , it is often impossible to perfectly adjust results to the common basis in table  [ tab : calibration ] .",
    "adjusting each study requires individual tuning , often in consultation with the authors . in many cases , it is only possible to estimate an average adjustment to this common basis , expecting that it will produce a better result than making no adjustment . for some adjustments ( described later in this section ) the situation is too ambiguous to find even an average value . as a general principle",
    ", we choose to adjust data in every case where such an adjustment is unambiguously better or supported by results from the literature , but otherwise prefer to leave data unaltered rather than implement adjustments that may prove erroneous ( although see  [ subsec : radio ] ) .",
    "we find that the largest offsets arise due to differences in assumed @xmath26@xmath9 conversion ( @xmath55 ) and stellar imf ( @xmath56 ) , which can lead to differences of several tenths of a dex .",
    "this is fortunate , because both allow an unambiguous recalibration to a common standard .",
    "choices of sps model ( @xmath57 ) also play a significant role , with different treatments of short - lived but extremely luminous stellar phases ( e.g. , the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ) leading to differences of @xmath1@xmath58dex .",
    "in addition , we find that adjusting radio / ir sfr studies for missing uv light ( `` extinction '' corrections ; @xmath59 ) boosts sfrs upwards by @xmath1dex .",
    "this effect is offset , however , by the -0.1dex adjustment used to account for bias present in radio studies between the mean ( derived through median stacking ) and median ( used by most other studies ) of a lognormal distribution .    after applying these calibrations",
    ", we find that stacked radio sfrs display systematic deviations from other sfr indicators @xmath60 ( i.e. the ir - to-1.4ghz conversion decreases as @xmath61 ) .",
    "we note that evolution is expected , and apply an empirical correction using the median redshifts of each radio ms observation , which leads to radio sfr calibration offsets ( @xmath62 ) as high as @xmath63dex . outside of these main calibrations , different cosmologies ( @xmath64 ) or",
    "emission line effects ( @xmath65 ) have relatively negligible ( @xmath66dex ) effects for most redshifts included here . based on previous results in the literature ( discussed below )",
    ", we do not choose to adjust our results for differences in assumed star formation history ( sfh ) , different dust attenuation _ curves _",
    "( we correct for dust as a whole when it has not been applied ) , possible photo - z biases , differences in sed fitting procedures , or other possible observational biases .",
    "lastly , we find that differing selection methods ( i.e. `` bluer '' vs. `` mixed '' vs. `` non - selective '' ; see  [ subsubsec : selection ] ) can lead to substantially different ms slopes , with bluer ( non - selective ) ms slopes biased towards values closer to unity ( zero ) relative to mixed slopes ( see figure  [ fig : slope_selection ] ) .",
    "these are shown in tables  [ tab : calibration ] and  [ tab : error_budget ] .",
    "each of these effects are discussed in more detail below . in ",
    "[ subsec : big_problems ] , we discuss seven calibration issues that could result in large offsets ( @xmath67 ) between different ms studies .",
    "these include : stellar imf (  [ subsubsec : imf ] ) , @xmath26@xmath9 conversion (  [ subsubsec : l_psi ] ) , sps model (  [ subsubsec : sps_model ] ) , sfh (  [ subsubsec : sfh ] ) , dust attenuation (  [ subsubsec : ext ] ) , dust attenuation curve (  [ subsubsec : ext_law ] ) , and emission line effects (  [ subsubsec : emission ] ) . in ",
    "[ subsec : small_problems ] , we discuss four other calibration issues that likely only have minor impacts ( @xmath68 ) on ms normalizations .",
    "these include : cosmology (  [ subsubsec : cosmology ] ) , use of photometric redshifts (  [ subsubsec : photoz ] ) , sed fitting procedures (  [ subsubsec : sed_fitting ] ) , and metallicity ( @xmath69 ;  [ subsubsec : metallicity ] ) . in ",
    "[ subsec : biases ] , we discuss the effects various observational biases have on ms parameters .",
    "these include the bias between the derived mean and median of a log - normal distribution (  [ subsubsec : lognormbias ] ) , the effects different selection methods have on derived ms parameters (  [ subsubsec : selection ] ) , systematic disagreements of @xmath45-selected data relative to the other data included here (  [ subsubsec : bzk ] ) , and the impact of various other observational biases ( incompleteness , eddington bias , and malmquist bias ) on the ms (  [ subsubsec : biases ] ) . in  [ subsec : radio ] , we discuss the observed disagreements between radio sfr observations compared to other sfr indicators .",

    "these are usually presumed to be universal ",
    "i.e. , unchanging with respect to time , current and/or past sfh , metalicity , etc .",
    "current evidence is conflicting : @xcite claim that the imf is likely universal , while @xcite argue that the imf becomes more top - heavy ( i.e. forming higher fractions of more massive stars ) with increasing sfrs .",
    "possible ramifications of this for ms evolution are discussed in @xcite , but at present the issue remains unresolved . in this work ,",
    "we assume a universal imf .",
    "evolution in the imf as a function of the sfr could change the derived ms slope , and evolution as a function of redshift could affect our evolutionary fits .",
    "the most common of these imfs are those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , most commonly ( but not universally ) integrated from @xmath38@xmath70 .",
    "these will be referred to as salpeter , chabrier , and kroupa imfs , respectively .",
    "the assumed imf impacts both the derived masses and sfrs , leading to variations of up to @xmath71 ( ke12 ) . at present",
    ", there are several different factors used to convert between these different imfs ( e07 ; s07 ; c09 ; k11 ; z12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we choose the imf offsets taken from z12 ( also seen in s07 and e07 ) because they have been calculated recently and assume the same sps model ( bc03 ) that we standardize to here .",
    "these take the form @xmath72 with the subscripts referring to kroupa , chabrier , and salpeter imfs , respectively .",
    "these correspond to mass offsets of @xmath73 and @xmath74dex .",
    "these agree well with the sfr offsets used to convert from @xcite ( k98 ) to ke12 ( which assume salpeter and kroupa imfs , respectively ) for sfrs derived from the fuv and nuv . in all cases , the shift between a chabrier and kroupa imf is essentially negligible . although all adjustments have been applied for completeness , we note that our results are unchanged if the chabrier imf - derived masses are left as they are .",
    "this mass adjustment is functionally equivalent to shifting the ms left or right ( i.e. , increasing / decreasing the sfr at a given mass ) with the observed mass ranges adjusted accordingly ( see tables  [ tab : msfr ] and  [ tab : msfr_corr ] ) .",
    "these lead to calibration offsets in the normalization , @xmath56 , of @xmath75 . for a slope of unity",
    ", these changes merely result in a shift of the observed range of the ms relation rather than the actual ms relation itself .",
    "however , as the majority of data compiled here have slopes of _ less _ than unity ( see figure  [ fig : slope_selection ] ) , and the sfr offsets are _ not _ equivalent to the mass offsets in some cases ( see ke12 ) , the majority of these changes _ do _ impact the observed normalizations significantly .",
    "for these reasons , we choose to only apply explicit imf adjustments to the derived masses , as the @xmath26@xmath9 relations outlined in the next section implicitly include such adjustments .",
    "sfrs are calculated based on observed galaxy luminosities over spectral ranges that correlate with active star formation in the past 10100myr .",
    "these most commonly are the uv continuum ( from @xmath76@xmath77 ) , h@xmath12 emission , and the total ir ( tir ) continuum ( from @xmath78@xmath79@xmath80 m ) .",
    "in addition , other sfr indicators , such as 1.4ghz emission , have further been developed by exploiting the tight observed radio ",
    "ir correlation @xcite , as well as from sed fitting to individual bands ( cf .",
    "s12 ) or multiband photometry ( cf .",
    "these indicators are sensitive to the sfr on different timescales : while h@xmath12 probes sfrs on @xmath81myr timescales , uv and tir ( and by extension 1.4ghz ) probe sfrs on @xmath82myr timescales . for additional discussion on the nature of sfr indicators and the assumptions used to derive them , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ke12 .",
    "most notably , the studies included here calculate integrated luminosities over the entire wavelength range of interest by fitting specific templates to observed bands .",
    "in the ir , these templates most often are taken from @xcite ( ce01 ) , @xcite ( dl01 ) , @xcite ( dh02 ) , and @xcite ( dl07 ) . in the uv ,",
    "the most commonly used templates are taken from bc03 , although @xcite ( b08 ) and @xcite ( b11 ) are also used . to account for additional strong emission lines , @xcite ( cl01 )",
    "templates are also sometimes used .",
    "each of these sfr indicators traces @xmath9 in different ways , over different timescales , and with different calibration issues ( see , e.g. , table  1 and section  3 of ke12 ) , with different @xmath26@xmath9 conversions differing by up to @xmath83 ( see , e.g. , the radio sfr calibrations from @xcite and @xcite ) . the standard calibration for most calculated sfrs today is k98 , based on a single power - law salpeter imf .",
    "while k98 gave reasonable sfr calibrations between sfr indicators , for many other wavelengths often studied , the relative calibrations are sensitive to the precise form of the imf .",

    "indeed , findings from so14 and @xcite seem to indicate that the uncertainty in sfhs leads almost _ all _ fitted parameters other than the mass to be extremely unreliable .",
    "given that the sfh of a typical ms galaxy , which likely includes both a rising and declining sfh component of varying degrees as a function of observed mass ( and hence formation time ; see  [ subsec : ms_tracks ] ) , as well as the small sample sizes of both studies , we do not utilize any possible sfh - based sfr adjustments here .",

    "in addition , results from @xcite imply that simple extinction corrections are insufficient to accurately correct for dust , and that more complex geometrical ( i.e. , patchy ) dust models are needed .",
    "regardless , by observing uv versus uv+ir emission from an ensemble of sfgs , one can apply average extinction corrections that should be sufficient to convert from the observed uv - derived sfr to the bolometric sfr .",
    "as observations imply that average irx of galaxies evolves strongly at higher redshifts ( e.g. , b12 ) , we will approximate the average irx observations using results presented by r12a ( @xmath139 ) at low-@xmath140 ( @xmath50 ) , and b12 ( @xmath141 at @xmath142@xmath143 ; see their table  6 for the full list of corrections ) at high-@xmath140 ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "extinction curves might still produce subtle biases in derived physical results .",
    "in particular , if the general shape / amount of pah emission is correlated with the fitted amount of extinction , then the use of models with constant ( or a lack of ) 2175 features will produce notable biases in sed - derived galaxy properties . using a flexible parametrization of dust attenuation , @xcite report a negative correlation between the slope of the attenuation curve and the strength of the 2175 bump ( i.e. , sed types with steeper attenuation curves have stronger bumps . ) .",
    "they find this leads to biases in derived dust attenuation ( large ) as well as masses ( small ) and specific sfrs ( ssfrs , @xmath43 ; also small ) .",
    "in addition , they find edge - on and/or low - ssfr galaxies tend to have steeper attenuation curves , while face - on and/or high ssfr galaxies tend to have shallower attenuation curves , implying possible dependencies on orientation . taking these findings into account",

    "these lines decrease ( i.e. , make more luminous ) the observed magnitude in a given band by up to several tenths of a mag at higher redshifts ( @xcite ; s11 ; @xcite )",

    "the relative impact depends on the number of bands included in the fit , their respective width , and the redshift of the source : for surveys with a large number of bands ( e.g. , cosmos ) , this effect will be somewhat washed out ; however , for surveys with only a handful of bands , this effect can make a big difference @xcite .",
    "@xcite show the effects that emission line contributions can have on the observed @xmath146@xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath10@xmath9 ) relationship at high redshifts ( where emission line contamination is most severe ) , and demonstrate that while on average the slope of the relation remains the same , the overall fitted masses decreases substantially .",

    "redshifts have been derived photometrically ( photo - z s ) via sed fitting rather than spectroscopically ( spec - z s ) .",
    "sps models are used to derive these photo - z s , which simultaneously provide the masses ( and sometimes sfrs ) used in these studies .",
    "photo - z s have varying precision , ranging from @xmath155@xmath156 scatter compared to their spec - z counterparts @xcite , and can be subject to `` catastrophic failures '' where the photo - z s and spec - z s disagree by more than @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",

    "although the errors from the average scatter are small , the effect of catastrophic failures on the @xmath10@xmath9 relation relative to that of confirmed spectroscopic samples has yet to be fully investigated .",
    "we conduct a simple experiment to qualitatively assess the effects of catastrophic errors @xmath10@xmath9 relationship , and find that their effect on the overall distribution appears small , even for a large fraction of catastrophic errors ( see appendix  [ app : eta_test ] ) .    in many cases , photo - z s",

    "in addition , simulated errors and catastrophic failure rates agree with the measured spectroscopic samples and are accounted for in some works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the quality of photo - z s have been checked with pair statistics and cross correlations , which seems to confirm errors derived from spec - z s @xcite .    on the whole , photo - z methods do not seem to display large redshift biases relative to spec - z s , and the likely induced scatter is small relative to scatter about the ms and other systematic errors @xcite .",
    "any possible systematic offsets they have relative to spec - z s are not accounted for in this study .",
    "besides the variations in generating seds that have been detailed above , the sed fitting procedure used to derive photometric redshifts differs for different codes .",
    "each of these fitting procedures , besides contamination from catastrophic errors , might exhibit biases in the determined photo - z s relative to the true spec - z s and/or each other .",
    "in particular , the best fit parameters derived from sed fitting tend to be sensitive to small changes in parameter space and errors on the photometry .",
    "this can be reduced by incorporating a wider range of parameter space into the final mass , such as by taking the median mass across all solutions in the entire multi - dimensional parameter space for each fit that lies within 1@xmath2 of the best fit ( so14 ; see appendix  [ app : mass_disc ] ) .",
    "at the moment , however , since such procedures are not widely used , we will not attempt to account for these effects here .    in order to directly test different photo - z codes / fitting procedures against each other , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite compare photo - z code performance against each other using identical samples .",
    "their results indicate that , in general , all codes produce reasonable photo - z estimates in both an absolute and relative sense , although using a training set of spec - z priors reduces both the scatter and the fraction of catastrophic errors .",
    "their findings also indicate that using a training set from a small region of the sky does not seem to produce biases when applied to larger survey areas , and that the median of all codes seems to do better than any individual code at matching spec - z s .",
    "most crucially , @xcite find that photo - z errors and the fraction of catastrophic errors are the largest for data at higher magnitudes ( i.e. , are fainter with larger error bars ) , which implies the majority of photo - z errors should happen preferentially to low - mass , low - sfr galaxies observed within any given sample ( precisely where spec - z s are lacking ) .",
    "while these results provide areas for photo - z codes to improves and that should be investigated , based on these overall positive results , we do not opt to attempt to account for possible differences among sed fitting procedures .",
    "stellar evolutionary tracks ( i.e. isochrones ) used by sps models can be strong functions of metallicity . currently , sps models do not model metallicity evolution self - consistently , which would involve tracing the evolving metallicity content of stellar populations over time from supernovae injections , mixing , elemental abundance patterns , etc . , and their subsequent impact of star formation and evolution . instead , many resort to using simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , which follow the evolution in time of the sed of a single , coeval stellar population at a single fixed metallicity and abundance pattern .",
    "the effects of using ssps relative to populations where metallicity evolution is taken into account is not fully understood .",

    "while systematics from using fixed - metallicity ssps are not accounted for , we can at least investigate a related assumption : the effects using _ different _ metallicities in ssps have on the derived physical parameters . at low redshifts ( @xmath161 ) , results from m13",
    "( see their appendix  b ) seem to indicate that assuming a fixed solar metallicity relative to a much wider metallicity distribution ( from @xmath3@xmath162@xmath163 ) does not have a major impact on the resulting mass distribution both at fixed redshift and as a function of redshift ( their impact on sfrs has yet to be thoroughly investigated ) . based on these findings , and the fact that the majority of studies included here include sensible metallicity priors , we do not attempt to implement any adjustments due to possible metallicity - induced effects .        while the mean and median of a log - normal distribution are approximately identical when calculated in log space , the expected mean of a log - normal distribution is skewed in linear space @xcite .",

    "this effect has been included in the @xmath55 calibration offsets presented in table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "selection effects within each study  not to mention within the definition of the ms itself  also can affect both the derived slopes and their evolution as a function of redshift ( o10 ; k11 ; w12 ) .",
    "while most of these ( see table  [ tab : msfr_info ] ) are efficient at selecting sfgs , they do not all select the same population .",
    "as k11 show in their appendix  c , @xmath135@xmath140 vs. @xmath140@xmath168 ( @xmath45 ; @xcite ( d04 ) ) selection  and a bluer selection criteria in general  is biased towards more `` active '' sfgs ( i.e. with higher ( s)sfrs ) , excluding good portions of galaxies that are classified as sfgs via other selection mechanisms ( @xmath169 vs. @xmath170 ; @xmath171 ) , and give steeper ms slopes ( see also o10 and k11 ) .",
    "w12 shows that this effect further translates into an inherent bias against redder , more dust - attenuated sfgs ( see their figure  3 ) , which have lower slopes compared to their bluer , less dust - attenuated counterparts .",
    "see also @xcite for more discussion on this issue .",
    "because of these effects , selection methods that are inherently biased towards bluer , highly - active , non - dusty sfg populations will preferentially select a subset of the ms population with a higher slope relative to other selection mechanisms .",
    "these selection methods include : @xmath45 , used to select sfgs from @xmath172 ( d07 ; r11 ; k13 ) ; the lyman break ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; b12 ) , used to select high-@xmath140 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) ; and @xmath173 vs. @xmath174 , or any other cut on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) that explicitly selects based on ( blue ) color ( e07 ) .",
    "we therefore classify these methods as `` bluer '' selection mechanisms , along with luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) selected samples such as that of e11  although lirgs are definitely sfgs , nearby lirgs tend to be highly active sfgs with large amounts of dust attenuation and extreme amounts of star formation , in contrast to `` regular '' ms galaxies that are more similar to the milky way at low redshifts from , e.g. , b04 and s07 .    as can be seen by comparing selection methods from , e.g. e07 ( see their figure  2 ) and @xcite",
    "( see their figure  3 ) , non-``bluer '' selection methods ( broadly classified as `` mixed '' ) seem to provide not only a `` cleaner '' cut between sfgs and quiescent galaxies , but a more diverse star - forming population .",
    "the total classification scheme of these two selection types is listed in table  [ tab : msfr_info ] . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "while these different selection methods do not seem to affect the average observed sfrs across different publications , they do seem to influence the derived slopes and the intrinsic scatter ( see  [ subsubsec : bzk ] ) .",
    "although differences between bluer and mixed selection criteria can lead to differences in the derived ms relations , all ms studies should ideally only include sfgs in their analysis .",
    "several of the studies included here do not opt to impose a color - color cut of some sort to separate out sfg and quiescent galaxy populations ( c09 , so14 , and c14 ) .",

    "quiescent galaxies `` contaminate '' their highest mass bins at a wide range of redshifts , their lower sfrs significantly reduce the slope . in addition , their increased prevalence at lower masses at lower redshifts ( as more and more galaxies `` quench '' ) leads to increasing offsets in normalizations for any flux - limited survey .",
    "this effect is accentuated by increases in survey sensitivity , which can drive the sfr floor lower at all massess .",
    "as expected , we find that all non - selective studies agree with other data relatively well at lower masses ( especially at higher redshifts ) , but disagree significantly at higher masses due to shallower ms relations for a more extensive discussion . ] .    in figure",

    "as expected , we also find that `` bluer '' ms observations display slopes between @xmath175@xmath15 and are relatively similar over the majority of the age of the universe , while `` mixed '' observations center around @xmath16 and display possible time - dependencies . in addition , most of the high slopes at lower redshift for our `` mixed '' data are from d09 ; the bimodality is much sharper when their data is excluded . ] .",
    "based on these results , we decide to use our bluer / mixed classification scheme to account for different biases inherent in sfg / ms selection , preferring mixed selection methods to bluer ones since they give us a larger and more diverse sfg sample while still excluding most quiescent galaxies .",
    "we find that the true and deconvolved scatters ( see  [ subsec : scatter ] ) reported in all @xmath45-selected studies ( d07 ; r11 ; k13 ) are systematically lower than reported in other papers , even for large sample sizes ( r11 ) .",
    "furthermore , their resulting values are low enough to likely be unphysical , especially given the possible @xmath1dex of intrinsic scatter in determining mass ( even when considering possible convariances ; see appendix  [ app : mass_disc ] ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the scatter observed in these papers is not representative of the redshift range that they encompass , and hence that @xmath45 is substantially biased compared to other selection mechanisms ( data taken from lbgs , for instance , show similar scatters as other `` mixed '' samples ; m10 ; l12 ; r12 ) ) .",
    "most likely , this difference is due to an inherent bias built into the @xmath45 selection mechanism itself .",
    "as outlined in d04 , the @xmath135@xmath140/@xmath140@xmath168 line used to select @xmath45 galaxies was designed to be parallel to the reddening vector . however , due to the age - extinction degeneracy , this means that age runs perpendicular to the selection function , and implies that you will systematically be missing older ( and hence likely more massive and dusty ) galaxies because of their redder colors . as lbg selection mechanisms are not explicitly designed this way ,",
    "although redder sfgs are still selected against , the selection bias is not as systematic or complete as using @xmath45 .",
    "thus , while @xmath45 is effective at selecting for sfgs for @xmath172 , the distribution and scatter of the sample is biased ( @xmath176 while @xmath177 ; see  [ subsubsec : scatter_true ] ) .",
    "however , tests we have conducted on the @xcite cosmos catalog find that @xmath45-selection is actually quite efficient at selecting out sfgs between @xmath172 ( o. ilbert , priv .",
    "although see d09 , p09 , and k11 ) . while this does not rule out the possibility of intrinsically biased selection , it does point to another possibility .",
    "instead , the narrower distribution might likely arise due to systematic biases in calculating bolometric sfrs .",
    "extinction corrections in @xmath45 samples are determined exclusively from @xmath135@xmath140 color ( d04 ) , and so the same bands used to select the sample are also used to determine the dust attenuation . using a large sample of lbgs",
    ", b12 finds that using the same passbands for both selection and dust attenuation measurements leads to large biases in the derived dust attenuations .",
    "this implies we might be witnessing a similar problem with @xmath45-selected sample here , where the problem is not with inherent selection biases , but with substantially biased calculations of dust attenuation and hence a narrower distribution bolometric sfrs .",
    "we note that apart from @xmath45 , the only other data points which display lower - than - average scatter are those with small sample sizes ( @xmath178 250 ) , as well as those from s09 ( although s09 uses a 2-sigma - clipped fitting procedures that biases the scatters by default ; see table  [ tab : msfr ] ) .",
    "there are several main biases that characterize observations of the sfg ms : incompleteness , malmquist bias , and eddington bias .",
    "if a survey is not mass - complete , observations will be biased towards bluer galaxies both due to the flux - limited nature of most surveys as well as many sed fitting procedures ( which are sensitive to the signal - to - noise ratio of the photometry ; see @xcite ) , which will affect properties of the ms relation below the mass completeness limit .",
    "this is easily rectified by only using data where the survey is approximately mass complete , as is done in , e.g. , w12 ( see their figure  1 ) . for the studies collected here",
    ", we find that on average this effect on the reported ms fits is small compared to the other issues discussed above , and therefore do not correct for it here .",
    "there are also other competing effects in most surveys that tend to become more prominent near mass limits , most notably a malmquist bias of selecting galaxies with larger sfrs at a given stellar mass in a flux - limited sample ( see r12 s appendix  b ) .",
    "as the ( s)sfr of galaxies are a strong function of their mass , malmquist bias will result in higher ( s)sfrs derived on average for a given mass for masses where the flux limit approaches the hypothesized distribution .",
    "as shown in r12 ( see their figure  26 ) , this bias can lead to derivations of ssfrs from their true values on the low mass end by a factor of @xmath784 . in general , such a bias is strongest the more flux - limited a sample is ( and as such is different from just strict mass completeness ) , and most prominently affects galaxies on the low - mass end of the ms . as this leads to higher average sfrs for these objects as compared to higher mass objects , this would lead to a shallower fitted slope , which could imply that all ms observations really should have slopes of approximately unity .",
    "however , as relatively mass - complete surveys ( e.g. , k11 ; w12 ) find slopes much less than unity , such an argument is strongly disfavored . ] .",
    "another possible impact of malmquist bias would be a strong selection effect towards bursting low - mass sfgs near the detection limits , as they would be more likely to be detected over their non - bursting counterparts .",
    "this might lead to a strong bias in sed - fitting procedures towards very young ages for low - mass , low - sfr systems ( bottom - left of the ms ) , which might in turn bias ms slopes .",
    "as such a trend is not seen in r12 , such a strong systematic bias is likely not strong .    on the high - mass / high - sfr end ,",
    "eddington bias ( i.e. that random scatter in a given mass / luminosity bin will preferentially scatter objects up into higher mass / luminosity bins because they have comparatively fewer objects ) tends to be much more dominant .",
    "such bias might lead to a flattening of the ms at high masses as lower mass ( and hence lower sfr ) objects are scattered up into higher mass bins .",
    "this effect , however , should also lead to objects with lower sfrs being upscattered into higher sfr bins ( assuming , of course , that the sfr / mass derivations are somewhat independent of one another , as they are constrained by different portions of the sed ) , causing an upturn in the ms relation .",
    "these two effects should then combine to produce a more densely populated upper population in the derived ms relation , with a downturn for samples with well - constrained sfrs and less well - constrained masses ( e.g. , empirically - derived h@xmath12 sfrs from high - quality spectra and sed - fitted masses from multiband photometry ) , an upturn for samples with well - constrained masses and poorly constrained sfrs ( i.e. extintion - corrected uv sfrs with sed - fitted masses from extensive , high - quality multiband photometry ) , and a similar slope for samples with about equivalent constraints on both ( i.e. both masses and sfrs derived through sed fitting ) .",
    "all these scenarios are only relevant , however , assuming photo - z accuracy does not depend on other physical parameters and is relatively good for the majority objects included in the fit .",
    "this is not necessarily true ",
    "like masses and sfrs , photo - z accuracy is sensitive to the overall shape of the sed .",
    "this can lead to complex covariances which have not been fully explored ( but see appendix  [ app : eta_test ] ) .",
    "if the photo - z is incorrect , then masses may likely be overestimated and sfrs derived from the incorrect portion of the spectrum , which will lead to more complicated behavior .",
    "note that not all studies are affected by photo - z biases : @xmath45- , lbg- , and line - selected samples have precise redshift distributions that are applied to the mass fitting rather than using the photo - z for each individual source .    in all cases",
    ", however , there will be a bias towards higher numbers of mass / sfr objects .",
    "these effects should not have a large impact on ms relations derived directly from nonstacked data ( due to the small number of objects at the high mass end ) , although for stacked data ( especially using mean instead of median stacks ) , this effect is expected be more prominent . in many studies , however , the slope of the ms is computed from binned data , with mass bins often assigned equal weight regardless of the size of each bin . in these cases , using mass bins is essentially the same as stacking and implies likely contributions from eddington bias on the high - mass end of the ms .",
    "although we do not attempt to correct for it here , we thus can not exclude a significant contribution from eddington bias for massive galaxies .      in the left panel of figure  [ fig : radio_sfr_t ] , we plot sfrs at fixed @xmath179 after applying the calibrations discussed above and listed in table  [ tab : calibration ] .",
    "as can be seen , sfrs derived from stacked radio observations are systematically larger than those derived via other methods , and also seem to display a steeper time dependence .",
    "this is consistent across all radio data included in this study and all mass ranges probed .    in order to characterize the possible time / redshift - dependent component of the observed offset",
    ", we fit our data using the methods described in  [ sec : methodology ] for the radio data alone as well as for all other data excluding the radio data .",
    "parametrizing @xmath180 , we find that , at fixed @xmath181 , @xmath182 for the radio - only fit and @xmath183 for the radio - excluded fit ( i.e. larger radio sfrs relative to other sfr indicators ) . in the right panel of figure  [ fig : radio_sfr_t ] , we plot radio sfrs after accounting for this @xmath184 systematic offset ( which we term @xmath62 ) using the median redshifts of each radio ms observation .",
    "as can be seen , these new radio data agree well with the rest of the observations included here and do not alter the fit substantially .",
    "note that this is not entirely by design ( although such a procedure by nature should induce overall agreement ) , as this redshift - dependent offset could just as easily have left a remaining constant offset between the radio sfrs and the other sfr indicators . due our empirical methodology of accounting for these offsets , in our later series of fits",
    "( see tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fits_z ] ) we fit the evolution of the ms with and without including radio sfr data as well as with and without this offset .    as this finding may have important implications interpreting studies heavily reliant on the precise redshift evolution of radio sfr data ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we investigate possible reasons for this disagreement in appendix  [ app : bell ] .",
    "briefly , the systematic disagreements between radio sfr calibrations and other data that emerge after moving all data to a common set of calibrations mainly arises due to assumptions regarding @xmath100  contrary to the straightfoward conversion presented in @xcite , the often - used @xcite radio @xmath26@xmath9 calibration uses a different @xmath185 value than reported for the entire sample , and in addition attempts to account for light emitted by older stellar populations .",
    "calibration assumptions themselves , however , can not account for steeper redshift evolution observed here since they only adjust the normalizations ",
    "the ke12 relations merely serve to highlight existing differences previously hidden in the data .",
    "although scenarios involving radio suppression from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , redshift evolution of the radio spectral index @xmath186 @xcite , or unknown biases present in the stacking procedures used here @xcite appear to be the most reasonable explanations , they seem unlikely ( at least , at lower redshift ) based on existing data ( a. karim , priv . comm . ; again , see appendix  [ app : bell ] ) .    given the amount of data included here , the self - consistent nature of the @xmath26@xmath9 conversions used in this work",
    "( see  [ subsubsec : l_psi ] ) , and the relatively straightforward way that both ir and radio sfrs are derived , we are fairly confident that this systematic @xmath184 disagreement is not a spurious effect . although we are ultimately unsure of its origins , it is likely that some combination of the effects discussed above ( and other possible issues likely not accounted for here ) might serve as the underlying basis for the observed redshift evolution .",
    "future studies should hopefully be able to clarify this issue .",
    "in order to fit a robust functional form for the ms that includes not only information on the slope and normalization as a function of time but also eliminates some of the degeneracies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 between samples with similar observational properties , the observed mass ranges from each study ( see tables  [ tab : msfr ] and  [ tab : msfr_corr ] ) are incorporated into the fit and considered the boundaries of that specific ms .",
    "thus , only studies that contain objects at , e.g. , @xmath187 , are included when fitting for the sfr evolution of galaxies at that mass .",
    "these mass ranges have either been taken directly from the paper in question or estimated based on the data included in the relevant fits , rounded to the nearest @xmath38dex after excluding outlying points .",
    "for stacked data , the mass ranges have been taken from the medians of the lower and upper mass bins included in the fit , and thus the errors are approximately equivalent to the width of the bin , or @xmath1@xmath58dex . when imf and sps model adjustments ( among others ) are significant ( i.e. salpeter to kroupa or cb07 to bc03 ) , the reported mass ranges have been adjusted accordingly in table  [ tab : msfr_corr ] .    using this additional mass information",
    ", we proceed to fit the evolution of the sfr at fixed mass as a function of time , @xmath188 with sfrs calculated from the reported ms fits in each individual paper .",
    "these are only included if the ms from the study in question _ is observed at that given mass _",
    "( i.e. is within the @xmath189 range observed ) .",
    "this allows us to account for observational limitations inherent in individual ms observations and different selection methods .",
    "we choose this form to parametrize the ms as am easy compromise between prior expectations and the observed data .",
    "our decision to parametrize @xmath190 as a function of @xmath5 was motivated by the log - normal distribution of the ms in @xmath10@xmath9 space and the likely dependence of ms evolution on the more physical time instead of redshift .",
    "a straightforward linear fit was then found to give the best fit to the data and was subsequently adopted .",
    "this behavior was expected given the log - normal distribution of the ms ( which implies logsfr ) , as well as the likely dependent variable governing evolution being time instead of redshift ( linear t ) .",
    "we then simply chose a linear function as the simplest to fit the data and found it provided a good parametrization .",
    "this is now included in the paper .    by fitting @xmath191 s and @xmath192 s for a grid of masses ,",
    "we then can derive a function of the form @xmath193 assuming a given parametrization for @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "in other words , instead of fitting the ms by simply averaging over all observed @xmath12 s and @xmath13 s as a function of time , we average a subset of the observed slopes / normalizations for each mass bin and then fit the derived parameters within each mass bin as a function of mass . by doing this process for a grid of masses within a specified dynamical range , and specifying a minimum number of observations required to include a mass bin in the fit ( @xmath196 ) , we are then able to derive a more robust , mass - dependent parametrization of the ms .    before beginning our analysis",
    ", we wish to find a balance in the data between including all available observations and establishing a robust , self - consistent sample . in the hopes of reducing the impacts of systematic and observational biases on our parametrizations , we remove data in the first and last 2gyrs ( i.e. , @xmath197gyr and @xmath198gyr ) from our analysis ( as determined by the median redshifts of the respective samples ) .",
    "the rationale behind this is twofold . at the high redshift end",
    ", we get much higher uncertainties in masses and sfrs , which is to be expected : observations are more difficult , sample sizes are smaller , selection effects are worse , and hidden biases are more prominent . by removing these points , we restrict ourselves to observations where data are more tightly constrained .    at low redshift ,",
    "several studies have used sdss data ( s07 ; c09(1 ) ; z12(1 ) ; c14(1 ) ) , and so have essentially just fit the same set of photometry in different ways with different selection criteria .",
    "in addition to almost identical datasets , these studies often need to utilize aperture corrections to account for missing light , which can lead to additional sources of uncertainty relative to higher-@xmath140 samples ( b04 ; s07 ; c09 ; z12 )",
    ". as we are not able to distinguish a `` best '' ms fit among them , we decide not to include them at all rather than unduly overweight the fit towards results in the local universe ( see appendix  [ app : low_z ] ) .",
    "both series of points , however , do provide useful information even though they are not included in our main sample .",
    "most basically , their presence can test the validity of our parametrization of ms evolution at both early and late times .",
    "good agreement at late times ( low redshift ) would be encouraging and indicate the fit is probably good , while good agreement at early times ( high redshift ) would be important in confirming that , contrary to some observations ( m10 ; @xcite ) , the average ssfr for galaxies does not `` plateau '' at high redshift and where it continues to increase with a relatively shallow slope . ] .",
    "the differences between the sdss observations on the low redshift end can give some sense of the different systematic biases present in the different assumptions that are made in the process of deriving a ms fit ( since they are done on similar sets of photometry ) , while those at high redshift give more insight into the effects of selection biases , differing photometry , sed fitting procedures , and dust corrections .",
    "these will be discussed in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "as discussed in  [ subsubsec : selection ] , non - selective methods  which do not probe the sf ms but rather the weighted average of star - forming and quiescent galaxies  display prominent biases in both slope ( as a function of redshift ) and normalization ( as a function of mass ) compared to the other methods discussed above .",
    "the differences in slope as a function of redshift can most clearly be seen in figure  [ fig : slope_selection ] , where non - selective studies ( purple ) display slopes well below those of bluer- or mixed - selected studies .",
    "differences in normalization as a function of mass can be seen by examining figure  [ fig : slope_selection ] and comparing normalizations of non - selective studies ( purple ) at @xmath199 ( where agreement with other data is fair ) and @xmath200 ( where non - selective sfrs are well below other studies ) . the opposite effect is observed .",
    "this might be due to the increasing influence _",
    "any _ quiescent contamination has in the sample when sfrs are on average higher ( while quiescents are by definition low ) , or possible biases in c14 s fitted @xmath10@xmath9 distributions ( where most of the non - selective sample is drawn from at high masses ) .",
    "] as a result , over a broad range of masses , ms observations ( number ) from c09 ( 2 ) , so14 ( 4 ) , and c14 ( 7 ) ( all non - selective studies ) tend to disagree by several tenths of a dex with other measurements from the literature .",
    "in order to develop a consistent picture of main sequence evolution , studies with large systematic differences should be considered in separate groups and comparisons drawn within a group . as a result",
    ", we exclude these non - selective studies from our main set of fits .",
    "in addition to these non - selective studies , ms observations ( number ) from e11 ( 1 ) and z12(3 ) ( 1 ) also display disagreements with the majority of the sample of up to several tenths of a dex . here , however , we have the opposite problem : their samples tend to exhibit much higher sfrs at a given mass compared with other data in the literature . for z12(3 ) , this discrepancy is best highlighted at low masses in the top - right panel of figure  [ fig : sfr_t_relations_selection ] , where their data ( green ) lies substantially above the majority of other data at @xmath23 . for e11 ,",
    "on the other hand , this discrepancy mainly occurs at high masses , and best be seen in the lower - right panel of figure  [ fig : sfr_t_relations_selection ] where their data ( also green ) lies over an order of magnitude above most other low-@xmath140 data . as e11 restricts their sample to only include highly - active sfgs ( i.e. lirgs ) and not `` typical '' ms galaxies ( such as the large sdss samples of b04 , e07 , s07 , z12 , and c14 , or the swire sample of o10 ) , their analysis is likely inherently biased ; it is not surprising that their results disagree with all others at low redshifts . in the case of z12(3 ) , however , we are ultimately unsure where the root cause of the apparent disagreement arises , although the explanation might likely involve different choices of extinction corrections ( especially at lower masses ) or some aspect of their selection criteria .",
    "although we opt to exclude these two results from all our ms fits , we note that including them has a negligible impact on the majority of our fits .",
    "as mentioned above , sfrs at a given mass are calculated based on the reported best fit relations from the studies in question . as",
    "not all studies report errors on their ms fits , and the errors are symptomatic of the observed scatter about the ms , we instead incorporate errors into our fit by including the _ scatter _ reported in the papers in question ( see  [ subsec : scatter ] ) . as the scatter in almost all cases is larger than the reported errors ,",
    "this process is a conservative estimate that will likely inflate our reported errors .",
    "however , as we are fitting observed sfrs as a function of time ( which display scatter about the best ms fit ) in bins of mass , injecting this amount of scatter is actually more physical .",
    "we plot the @xmath201 relations derived for @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath200 in figures  [ fig : sfr_t_relations_selection ] and  [ fig : sfr_t_relations ] , color - coded by selection type and sfr indicator , respectively .    after compiling @xmath191 s and @xmath192 s for a grid of masses ,",
    "we fit them as linear functions of @xmath189 , with @xmath205 which gives us @xmath206 some quick rearranging allows us to write this in a more familiar form , @xmath207 where we have redefined @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 for clarity / convenience .",
    "this leads us to a functional fit to the ms of the form as seen in equation  [ eq : ms_1 ] , with @xmath212 and @xmath213 now linear functions of time .",
    "we may also rewrite this new time - dependent equation , ms(@xmath5 ) , in terms of a mixed power - exponential model , @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "as the errors on the fits are highly dependent on the number of observations available at a given mass , the errors from one mass bin to the next are highly correlated ( as observations tend to cluster in the mass ranges they probe at a given redshift ) .",
    "however , as will be argued below , the extent to which these correlated errors ( dependent on the estimates of the internal scatter for each observation as well as the scatter between observations ) impact our results should be small and does not change our conclusions .    in order to compare our results to previous ones in the literature",

    ", we end up with a slightly different parametrization , with @xmath219 where @xmath220 . unlike in the ms(@xmath5 ) case , here we have fit the ms as a mass - dependent power law in @xmath140 and @xmath10 . on average , values in the literature seem to report that @xmath221 out to @xmath32 ( o10 ; k11 ) .",
    "as we have fit linear functions for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , doing a simple linear fit to two fiducial @xmath189 values gives the predicted ms(@xmath140 ) relation at any given redshift .",
    "our best fit @xmath222 evolution goes as @xmath223 , in good agreement with the evolution assumed in @xcite .",

    "we include the values of both sets of coefficients at fixed mass ( @xmath179 ) in tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fits_z ] .",
    "although we note that redshift - dependent parametrizations of ms evolution give decent fits to the data , we find that time - based parametrizations provide overall better fits ( see appendix  [ app : details ] ) .",
    "each ms observation we include has been measured within a predefined redshift window , and therefore has an associated time - window ( @xmath228 ) that accompanies it . because of this , the _ observed _ scatter about the ms ( @xmath2 ) is actually the intrinsic scatter ( i.e. `` deconvolved '' scatter , @xmath229 ) about the ms convolved with the ms s evolution within the given time interval .",
    "they are therefore overestimates . in order to deconvolve the observed scatter with this effect",
    ", we use our best fits to approximate ms evolution within each time bin ( @xmath228 ) , and subtract this evolution from the observed scatter . in order to account for first - order volume effects , we assume that within each redshift bin in question , the number density and mass distribution of ms galaxies is approximately constant , and weight each result according to the changing comoving volume within each redshift bin .",
    "accounting for this effect slightly decreases the total magnitude of the deconvolution ( from that of a simple tophat function ) , and so is again a conservative estimate on the effects of ms evolution within each redshift bin .",
    "we then refit the ms using these new , smaller scatters until we get a convergent solution .",
    "we find that differential mass evolution within each time bin is small relative to the absolute changes in sfrs , and approximate the evolution of the ms as one entirely in normalization , with @xmath230 in good agreement with results from so14 ( @xmath231 ) after taking into account differences in selection , fully consistent with the their results . ] .",
    "we note , however , that this differential mass evolution is _ not _ negligible ( see  [ sec : results ] ) , and would imply that there should be a greater evolution at higher masses , and hence more scatter , relative to lower masses ( see  [ subsec : ms_tracks ] ) .",
    "the actual change between @xmath2 and @xmath229 in most cases is negligible ( see table  [ tab : msfr ] ) , but for the data with the largest @xmath228 s the correction leads to a reduction of @xmath232dex ( see figure  [ fig : scatter ] ) .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the precise value chosen for @xmath18 here , only the approximate magnitude , with shifts in @xmath18 of @xmath233 leading to changes in @xmath229 of at most @xmath234dex , and does not affect our results from  [ subsubsec : scatter_true ] .",
    "the deconvolved , `` intrinsic '' scatter , however , is still not the `` true '' scatter ( @xmath235 ) about the ms , as errors in observing / deriving relevant physical quantities ( i.e. photo - z s , masses , and sfrs ) will further tend to inflate the observed distribution . in order to account for this observation - induced scatter ,",
    "we look for metrics by which to estimate the approximate variation present in any given indicator used to derive one of these quantities relative to another ( hopefully more reliable ) metric .    for photo - z s ,",
    "this comparison is easy in principle , as we are able to compare them against their more accurate spec - z counterparts .",
    "based on our first - order volume - weighted calculations , the average scatter in the photo - z vs. spec - z relation  ignoring contamination by catastrophic errors , interdependencies on masses and sfrs , and other observational biases  will tend to increase the observed scatter by at most @xmath236dex ( for average phot - z vs. spec - z errors of @xmath237 ) .",
    "these are essentially negligible and are not accounted for here .",
    "accounting for this effect would tend to further decrease the observed scatters , making the @xmath10@xmath9 relation even more tightly correlated .    at the moment , masses are mainly derived through sed fitting and do not have a range of available cross - checks .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , s12 ) have found other indicators that might work as `` empirical '' masses , any real vetting of such an indicator has yet to be undertaken .",
    "comparisons between dynamical and stellar mass measurements , however , are available , and provide helpful estimates of the uncertainties in mass estimates .",
    "these generally display scatters of @xmath3dex , and in addition find that any evolution systematic difference with redshift is small ( @xmath238dex ) up to @xmath239 @xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that sed - derived masses on quite accurate , and any intrinsic scatter present in stellar masses is at the @xmath240dex level or lower , well below the @xmath113dex of scatter observed in the ms .    to further characterize uncertainties in the sed - fitting procedure , we try and compare the cross - correlation between two methods of determining masses from the same sed fitting procedure and their effects on the derived @xmath10@xmath9 relations . while this can not test some of the uncertainties that go into the sed fitting procedure itself ( as the dynamical mass comparison above ) , it can test to see if there is some intrinsic scatter present in mass determinations that might inflate the @xmath10@xmath9 distribution . using the different mass determinations from so14 ( d. sobral , priv .",

    "these take into account mass lost through the death of massive , young stars ( zeroth - order ; @xmath291 ) as well as mass loss from the remaining ensemble of older stars ( first - order ; @xmath292 galaxy age , normalized to a @xmath293 galaxy ) .",
    "the latter expression is accurate to within a few percent of the final mass . as the use of these mass - loss prescriptions for a given final mass leads to less - efficient growth , these result in a shift to earlier formation times as well as earlier and larger peaks in sfrs . in the following discussion , we only discuss msi tracks for @xmath294 galaxies , which serve as a soft upper limit to typical sfgs seen today ( b04 ; s07 )",
    ". however , we have checked that the majority of our conclusions still hold for galaxies with smaller masses down to @xmath295 .",
    "two star - forming limits of the ms are clearly present in our tracks . at lower masses , we see that a typical ms galaxy experiences extremely rapid mass growth in a very short amount of time .",
    "this amounts to taking the limits @xmath296 \\approx \\left[\\alpha,\\beta,\\zeta\\right]$ ] at some particular time , where @xmath297 is the mass growth efficiency ( @xmath298 or @xmath299 ) as a function of time , which is a function of the age of the galaxy ( @xmath300 ) and the past sfh . in this limit",

    "the sfh is parametrized ( e.g. , exponentially declining , power - law rising , delayed-@xmath6 ) might influence sed - derived sfrs by up to several tenths of a dex @xcite ,",
    "choosing the proper sfhs for sed fitting is important if we wish to use them to eventually reliably derive physical properties of sfgs _ beyond _ just masses .",
    "our findings indicate that at young ages / early times / low masses , ms galaxy sfhs seem to be well - characterized by a rising sfhs , which can be well - modeled by any of the current linear , exponential , or power - law parametrizations , provided the ages are young . at middle ages / times / masses , ms galaxies are forming stars at around their peak sfrs , and are best fit by constant sfhs or very slowly rising / declining sfhs , depending how far around the peak they are currently being observed . finally , at later times",
    "/ older ages / higher masses , we see that ms galaxies are best characterized by traditional exponentially declining sfhs .    based on our msi - derived sfhs",
    ", we would expect there to be a changing distribution of sfhs with masses ( from linearly rising to constant to exponentially declining as the fitted mass increases ) since , at a given redshift , mass is a proxy for age . as of now , no paper has done a detailed study of the distribution of best - fit sfhs within ms relations at fixed redshifts .",
    "a study along these lines should help us better understand the parameter space explored when fitting ms galaxies ( both physically and computationally ) , and possibly lead to development of priors and other procedures that can cut down on the size of the parameter space that is often explored when fitting photometric data .",
    "a number of studies have shown that masses are relatively robust to variations in the sfh ( e.g. , @xcite ; r12 ; so14 ) .",
    "however , if one hopes to use sed - derived sfrs ( which can be quite sensitive to the sfh ) in addition to masses , these results indicate that typical ms sfhs ( for galaxies that follows the ms at all times and do not undergo any disruptive major mergers ) include a combination of all three types of sfhs  rising , constant , and exponentially declining  as a function of mass / age / time .",
    "we find that this type of behavior is naturally reproduced using delayed-@xmath6 sfhs ( see  [ subsubsec : sfh ] ) , and that no study included here except st14 has fit their samples using these sfhs .",
    "following recent results from @xcite and m13 , we further note that models including random burst components or multiple component sfhs will likely not significantly improve fits to the sed ( s11 ; so14 ) , and likely do not need to be included .      while the msi tracks are useful at exploring average ms evolution , they often fail to incorporate and/or generate _",
    "scatter _ about the ms ( l11 ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we propose a simple model to generate scatter about the ms and briefly explore its implications ( see also steinhardt & speagle 2014 , subm . ) .",
    "we first assume that ms galaxies all follow the deterministic evolutionary track set by our best - fit ms evolution included here , and that their evolution is only governed by their initial formation time . for a galaxy born at , e.g. , @xmath307gyr",
    ", we calculate its evolution in @xmath10@xmath9 space using the msi tracks outlined above that incorporate our first - order stellar mass loss approximation .",
    "in addition , galaxies at a given mass form at a variety of different times @xcite . in order to accommodate this initial spread in formation times , we further assume that , at any given time , an ensemble of ms galaxies with a spread in formation times all follow the same evolutionary tracks .",
    "thus , a galaxy born at , e.g. , @xmath307gyr would follow the same evolutionary track as one born @xmath308gyr before or after it . by extension , the galaxies born earlier / later would be @xmath308gyr `` ahead '' or `` behind '' at every possible time .",
    "due to both stellar mass loss and a ms slope of less than unity ( which prevents runaway exponential growth ) , galaxies evolving along the same set of evolutionary tracks at different times end up at slightly different locations in the @xmath10@xmath9 plane .",
    "if such an ensemble of `` coeval '' ms galaxies are observed at a common time , this translates into the upper and lower @xmath309 bounds of ms - like distribution .",
    "the only difference between an observed ms relation and our `` coeval '' ms relation is we have assumed that instead of a spread in sfr at a given mass ( or vice versa ) there is instead a completely fixed @xmath10@xmath9 relation with an initial spread in _ time_. as such an ensemble of galaxies follows the same evolutionary path ( by construction ) , they can be thought of as evolving `` in sync '' .",
    "consequently , we term this @xmath7 spread in ( formation ) time a _ synchronization timescale _ , @xmath310 .",
    "this could alternately be interpreted as determining the accuracy of a ms inversion , where we have turned our @xmath306 fits ( at fixed mass ) into @xmath311 ones .",
    "thus , @xmath310 is the accuracy to which we can determine the cosmic epoch when an observed ms galaxy is active given its mass and sfr : we have just transformed our `` vertical '' scatter ( in @xmath190 ) to a `` horizontal '' one ( in @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath310 is thus a physically meaningful quantity .    the behavior of @xmath310 as a function of time also has important implications for galaxy evolutionary models .",
    "at one extreme , galaxy evolution can be thought of as being driven by a variety of disruptive stochastic processes such as major mergers . at the other",
    ", galaxy evolution is instead driven by more deterministic ones such as `` cold mode '' accretion @xcite .",
    "if galaxy evolution is driven by disruptive , stochastic processes , then over a given interval an ensemble galaxies at higher redshifts should have smaller @xmath310 values compared to galaxies at low redshift as galaxies slowly `` evolve apart '' .",
    "however , if galaxies simply follow a common , deterministic track ( as we have assumed here using the ms ) or follow an attractor solution ( set by the ms ) , then @xmath310 should remain nearly redshift - independent across a wide range of redshifts .    as the sets of tracks offset by our choice of synchronization timescale serve as upper and lower @xmath7 bounds for the ms observed at any particular time , we can use @xmath310 to derive get the corresponding true scatter ( @xmath235 ) in sfr at a given mass . ] .",
    "the true scatter at a given mass is actually quite sensitive to the synchronization timescale that we pick , with changes of just @xmath33@xmath131gyr altering @xmath235 by @xmath312dex .",
    "our best - fit constant value of @xmath313dex directly translates into a constant @xmath310 of @xmath8gyr . a spread in formation times combined with smooth sfhs for",
    "individual galaxies thus can account for the observed scatter , and provides a consistent view of the evolution of the ms mergers , by contrast , must likely either remove objects from the ms entirely ( and must do so relatively quickly and/or infrequently ) or have very little effect on the overall @xmath10@xmath9 relation ( see also s11 ) .",
    "although this model provides a consistent framework for interpreting the ms , it is important to note that this model is not unique : a model with zero age spread and a stochastic component in the sfh of individual galaxies could plausibly also reproduce the data ( although possibly by construction ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , such a small @xmath310 implies that we can determine the cosmic epoch a galaxy is active to within @xmath314 ( @xmath315 including observational errors on the sfr ) knowing only its mass and sfr . combined with a good prior on the redshift",
    ", such accuracy could easily be turned into a strong prior on photo - z codes that could significantly constrain the parameter space that needs to be explored for any specific galaxy and would help to distinguish between competing solutions at markedly different redshifts . using this information thus offers the possibly of markedly reducing systematic catastrophic errors .",
    "this could be improved further by combining information on correlations among other physical parameters , such as the mass  dust attenuation relation from @xcite , irx@xmath316 results from r12a and b12 , and the form of the ms presented here .",
    "we plan to investigate possible improvements in photo - z accuracy and computational efficiency that can arise from such priors in a future work .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sfr_t_relations ] , the time - based extrapolations are overall consistent with the ms observed in the distant universe , with observations from d09 ( radio stacking , k - band limited survey ) , s11 ( spectroscopic follow - up of h@xmath12-emitting lbgs ) , l11 ( lbg survey ) , l12 ( lbg survey ) , b12 ( lbg survey ) , and st14 ( ir - limited survey combined with cosmos field data ) following our best fits to within @xmath132dex .",
    "we find that at higher masses , the observations of d09 , s11 , and st14 seem to follow our fits most closely , while at slightly lower masses those of l11 , l12 and b12 ( all deep photometric lbg surveys ) provide slightly better fits ( see figure  [ fig : sfr_t_relations ] and  [ fig : sfr_t_relations_selection ] ) .",
    "this dichotomy of results between flux - limited and lbg surveys might indicate two possibilities .",
    "the first would be that selection effects ( e.g. , a lower limit on the sfr , completeness ) play a significant role in ms observations at these high redshifts , even when surveys are not near detection limits .",
    "the second would be that extinction corrections in some of these studies have been under / overestimated at higher / lower massesdex in more massive galaxies . ] .",
    "these in turn might point to systematic issues with irx@xmath13 and sed - fitted extinction corrections .",
    "we note that both issues would serve to increase the ms slopes at these redshifts towards unity , in agreement with our ms fits .",
    "the good agreement at high redshift is somewhat surprising given that the @xmath190@xmath5 relationship is likely not indefinitely linear in time .",
    "assuming an eddington - limited starburst @xcite , such an upper - limit to the sfr would be approximately @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the characteristic physical scale of the `` starburst '' in kpc , @xmath319 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in units of 400kms@xmath41 , and @xmath320 is the dust opacity in units of 100@xmath321g@xmath41 . by assuming that the starbursting system is in virial equilibrium ( @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the total mass contained within @xmath318 ) and that @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is an arbitrary constant , we arrive at @xmath326 . for @xmath327 , such a system would display similar behavior to eddington - limited accretion for black holes .",
    "the fact that we do not see any type of limit up to @xmath265@xmath36 ( i.e. we still observe a continual increase in ssfr ; st14 ) is intriguing .    on the whole , the agreement between our fits and current high-@xmath140 observations is quite good ( st14 ) , and justifies our fits as functions of time instead of redshift ; other studies that fit ms evolution as function linear in redshift ( z12 ; w12 ) or as a power - law ( k11 ) do not provide nearly as good fits to the data over the full redshift range that we span .",
    "while we are not able to definitively rule out a possible `` plateauing '' of the ssfr in the redshifts explored here , our results seem to favor a scenario where the ssfr continues increasing until at least @xmath265 ( and likely plateaus afterwards ) .",

    "if we substitute a few scaling relations ( @xmath338 , @xmath339 , and @xmath340 , where @xmath341 is the characteristic radius of the system and @xmath136 is the corresponding characteristic velocity ) , assume the system is in virial equilibrium ( @xmath342 , where @xmath323 is the total mass contained within r ) , assume that @xmath343 , and that the dark matter halo follows a simple spherical distribution ( @xmath344 ) , we can transform the ks , es , and eks scaling relations listed above into more ms - like relations . substituting and rearraging , we derive ms relations for @xmath345 with @xmath346 , and @xmath347 and @xmath348 , and @xmath349 ( up to a scaling constant ) for the ks , es , and eks laws , respectively .    for each of these parametrizations , evolution the normalization of the sfr could be due to evolution in the average gas surface densities , while evolution in the slope could be due to deviations from some of the assumptions assumed here .",
    "these findings seem in good agreement with results from @xcite that ms galaxies likely follow a single , tight @xmath350@xmath351 ( i.e. @xmath9@xmath352 ) relation from redshift @xmath28@xmath353 .    in order to compare the results above ( involving sf laws in disks ) with those of the ms ( involving total masses ) , however ,",

    "using the recent results of @xcite that show an increase in ms slope of @xmath354 after limiting their analysis to disk components only , our best ms fits seem to imply a @xmath355@xmath356 relation that begins at approximately unity and decays to @xmath357 at @xmath19 . as the ks and",
    "es relations both predict ms slopes of @xmath357 , while the eks law predicts a slope closer to @xmath358 , our findings seem to support the former two views of star formation over the latter ranges from @xmath359@xmath360 ( @xmath361@xmath362 ) . ]",
    "( see also appendix  [ app : mass_function ] ) . taken together with observations that the es relation encompasses a broader range of galaxy classes than the ks relation while proving equally good fits @xcite , we interpret this as tentative evidence supporting the es view of star formation .    in conclusion ,",
    "if we assume current hydrodynamical simulations are representative of galaxy evolution at high-@xmath140 , our results seem to indicate that ms galaxies transition from `` cold mode '' accretion scenarios ( initial conditions ) to more general es - dominated modes of star formation ( equilibrium conditions ) over time .",
    "64 measurements of the star - forming ( sf ) `` main sequence '' ( ms ) from 25 papers have been combined to determine ms evolution out to @xmath0 .",
    "they have been recalibrated to use a common set of assumptions , correcting for stellar imf , @xmath26@xmath9 conversion , cosmology , sps model , dust attenuation , emission lines , and possible @xmath100 evolution .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .   by taking into account mass information ,",
    "we are able to derive a robust functional form for the ms that indicates strong differential mass evolution ( i.e. a time - dependent ms slope ) , with a best fit of @xmath363 .",
    "this provides good fits from @xmath28@xmath36 .",
    "almost all of our fits show strong departures from unity .",
    "2 .   using our fits , we are able to deconvolve the scatter around the ms with the scatter due to evolution within any given time / redshift bin . after accounting for intrinsic scatter among sfr indicators , we find that the true scatter among the ms is likely @xmath3dex rather than the @xmath33dex often reported .",
    "future studies should try and emulate this procedure to better compare the derived `` widths '' of ms observations .",
    "scatter about the ms is functionally equivalent to a group of galaxies following identical evolutionary tracks with an initial 1@xmath2 spread in formation times of @xmath8gyr .",
    "scatter about the ms ( i.e. @xmath3dex uncertainty in sfr at a given mass ) can thus be directly translated into a scatter in time ( i.e. @xmath364@xmath157 uncertainty in the age of the universe at a given mass and sfr ) .",
    "@xmath45-selected samples have systematically smaller scatters than most other studies included here , and are likely substantially biased compared to other selection mechanisms . more generally , we find that selection effects and other systematic effects can have a big impact on the slope of the ms and should be taken into account when conducting future surveys and interpreting results .",
    "4 .   with our new calibrations ,",
    "we report possible evidence for @xmath61 evolution in @xmath100 ( i.e. @xmath365 goes as @xmath184 ) .",
    "while the exact meaning of the observed evolution is still uncertain , this at least indicates that possible evolution in pre - existing radio assumptions should be considered when interpreting ( stacked ) radio sfr data in the future .",
    "the sfh of a typical ms galaxy involves a combination of approximately linearly rising , constant , and exponentially declining sfhs .",
    "these sfhs can be most easily generated using delayed-@xmath6 models , which should ideally be used in future studies to in order avoid possible biases when deriving physical properties outside of the mass .",
    "in addition , the fractional mass growth of a typical ms galaxy is approximately linear for the majority of its lifetime , with deviations at early and late times due to high ssfrs in the early universe and significant stellar mass loss from older stellar populations , respectively . 6 .",
    "the evolution of the sfr at fixed mass is well fit by a log - linear evolution in time .",
    "furthermore , fitting ms evolution as a function of time significantly improves the quality of the fits to the ms relative to previous fits as a function of redshift .",
    "existing studies on star formation represent a strong and consistent constraint on galaxy evolution over the past 12 billion years",
    ". the consistency of this constraint , however , is masked by inconsistent calibrations , and future studies should use a standard set of assumptions ( or provide conversion factors ) in order to make results directly comparable .",
    "we propose one such standard in this work ; however , as all studies included here have been calibrated to a set of common assumptions , any future study should be able to easily convert all these results to a modified set of assumptions without too much difficulty .",
    "similarly , future studies of sfgs should attempt to select their samples on more uniform criteria ( such as @xmath171 or @xmath47 ) and focus increased attention on the effects of various sfhs on sed fitting procedures in order to obtain more robust sed - derived sfrs and better constrain systematics .",
    "the methods of extracting more robust parameters from galaxy sed fits ( e.g. , the median masses used in so14 ) should be investigated in future studies .    by properly calibrating existing ms studies , we arrive at a consistent picture of star forming galaxies out to @xmath366 . however , this picture is one where high-@xmath140 galaxies have ever - higher masses and sfrs , sharpening a series of puzzles surrounding star formation in the early universe .",
    "it is difficult both empirically and theoretically  from fully empirical tracks @xcite or semi - empirical parametrizations @xcite to semi - analytic models @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite  to produce massive sfgs in the early universe .",
    "however , there seems to be no signs of deviation from this trend even out to @xmath367@xmath36 ( l12 ; st14 ) . the downsizing paradigm ( i.e. `` anti - hierarchical '' growth , with increasingly massive galaxies found at earlier redshifts )",
    "has long provided a theoretical challenge for merger - driven evolutionary models @xcite , and the consistency of this picture out to high redshift seems to further increase tension between theory and observation .    based on these results ,",
    "pushing observations to only slightly higher redshifts should move us from the regime of `` downsizing '' to one of `` upsizing '' ( with the resulting details likely to yield greatly improved models ) . if instead astronomers continue to find even more massive sfgs at earlier times , we are likely to arrive in a scenario where there was not enough time for these extremely high-@xmath140 objects",
    "to form given our current understanding of masses , structure formation , and the limits from the cmb on reionization .",

    "while this might not be true at higher redshifts or for data with very specific types of catastrophic failures ( e.g. , st14 ) , it at least seems to indicate that the relatively small percentage of catastrophic errors seen in previously published samples should have little impact on derived ms relations .",
    "at higher redshifts , all of the studies included here have assumed that @xmath100 is unchanging with time . however , this assumption might be incorrect , as radio samples the sfr in two different ways .",
    "the first is through non - thermal ( i.e. synchrotron ) radiation , which dominates at longer wavelengths ( i.e. 1.4ghz ) and underpins the tight ir  radio correlation .",
    "while the mechanism connecting the two is not well understood , it is thought to be due to cosmic ray electrons from supernovae being trapped in the magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "this ratio is potentially is sensitive to the cmb temperature as the cmb can cool ( suppress ) these cosmic ray electrons through inverse compton scattering if there is nt a high gas density that can shield the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the second is through bremsstrahlung ( free - free ) radiation from hii regions , which dominates at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath459 cm in local galaxies ) .",
    "this should be independent of the cmb temperature . as a result",
    ", the conversion from radio flux at a fixed wavelength may vary from a single power law as radio sfr studies have assumed ( and hence evolution in @xmath100 ) .",
    "this variation would likely be redshift - dependent and also sensitive to the gas content / geometry of the galaxy .",
    "such an evolution in @xmath100 , which we would expect to go as @xmath272 from a simple cmb temperature - suppression scenario , seems to match the observed systematic difference . a similar line of reasoning is taken in @xcite , who find that for the range of fields considered typical for spiral arms ( a few @xmath80 g ) , and for starburst galaxy nuclei ( @xmath460 g ) , inverse compton losses off the cmb dominate synchrotron losses in a typical ism at @xmath461 and in starburst nuclei at @xmath51 .",
    "there are multiple issues that might cast doubt on this line of reasoning .",
    "first and foremost , such logic leads to a _ suppression _ in radio luminosity , rather than the systematic _ increase _ that is observed .",
    "it also does not strictly scale as @xmath272 @xcite .",
    "in addition , this finding conflicts with those of @xcite , who investigated the ir  radio properties of galaxies in the cosmos field and did not see any evidence for an evolution of @xmath100 .",
    "although they are naturally limited by the data available ( ir observations with _ spitzer _",
    "only ) , their analysis argues convincingly against such trends in the data .",
    "additionally , the evolution in @xmath100 should only really be a major influencing factor at high redshift where direct detections are scarce ; it should nt affect low - redshift observations .",
    "our blanket @xmath272 correction might then be incorrect at lower redshifts .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , for cmb cooling to work efficiently at a wide range of higher redshifts there must some energy density in the magnetic fields across the star forming regions that is similar to what is observed in spiral arms locally .",
    "any evolution ( enhancement ) of typical magnetic field strengths will tend to directly counteract cooling losses . as galaxies at high redshift are more gas rich and highly star - forming ( although quite different from local ulirgs ) , such an enhancement in the typical magnetic field strengths seems quite plausible .",
    "these higher gas densities might also serve to shield the magnetic field from cmb cooling losses , again leading to a deviation from this @xmath272 behavior .",
    "deeper jvla observations might be able to untangle the two effects , as short wavelengths will have a larger free - free emission component that is not affected by possible redshift evolution . given the uncertainties , however , this line of reasoning remains an open possibility .",
    "most basically , such a disagreement might arise be due to the new calibration from ke12 ( taken from @xcite ) we adopt , which might inadvertantly boost the radio sfrs relative to the other calibrations . as the majority of the calibrations from ke12 seem consistent with each other , such an error would have to occur in the @xmath100 conversion from @xmath350 to @xmath112 . at first glance ,",
    "such a miscalibration seems plausible : the ke12 radio calibration gives sfrs approximately _",
    "twice _ that of k11 s @xcite calibration ( converted to a chabrier imf ) even though both use similar imfs and @xcite uses the @xcite s reported @xmath100 .",
    "however , @xcite makes several differing key assumptions that increase his sfrs by @xmath462@xmath463 .",
    "first , by using an energy budget argument to account for the ir emission generated by older stars , @xcite reduces his calibration by @xmath314 of its original value .",
    "in addition , by using a slightly different @xmath100 factor ( 2.52 , after he limits his sample to only more luminous ir galaxies ) for his conversion than reported for the full sample ( 2.64 ) , his calibration is further reduced by @xmath464 .    taking these factors into account ( plus",
    "the @xmath465 chabrier - to - kroupa imf conversion assumed here ) , we end up with a @xmath462@xmath463 increase in the reported k11 coefficient .",
    "this brings it well within the observed scatter ( 0.26dex ) in the ir ",
    "radio correlation itself , and is acceptable given the differences in modeling assumptions between the two studies .",
    "it also is relatively close to the empirically calculated @xmath350@xmath9 conversion reported in @xcite , which is @xmath466 lower than that of the @xcite calibration used here .",
    "furthermore , using the direct supernovae - to-1.4ghz conversion reported in @xcite , we get values favoring those of the ke12 relations , an independent piece of evidence that seems to suggest that our chosen @xmath26@xmath9 calibration is more accurate than the one reported in k11 .",
    "in addition to this good agreement with other calibrations , this line of reasoning also does not seem likely because our @xmath62 correction ( table  [ tab : corr ] ) only adjusted the normalizations of each of the radio samples ( d09 , p09 , and k11 ) by the same factor , not their redshift evolution .",
    "indeed , we find that the unaltered radio sfrs and our pre-@xmath62 corrected radio sfrs display similar evolutions in both redshift and time ( see the last few fits in tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fits_z ] ) .",
    "so the main effect of our new calibration was mainly to bring these pre - existing differences in the data to light .",
    "note that the differences between the ke12 and @xcite calibration mainly arise from the imf conversion ( salpeter to kroupa ) , the altered definition of @xmath100 being defined by the tir instead of fir , and the @xmath315 difference in ir calibration between that of k98 and ke12 .",
    "another possibility could involve evolution in either @xmath100 or the radio spectral index @xmath12 . to derive radio sfrs at higher redshifts ,",
    "all of the studies included here have assumed that @xmath100 and @xmath12 are redshift - independent and that a constant radio spectral index can be universally applied to all galaxies .",
    "while @xcite indicates these assumptions seem to hold to @xmath23 , they might not necessarily be true at all redshifts .",
    "an additional explanation might be that the radio stacking procedure itself leads to a systematic overestimate in the observed 1.4ghz luminosity .",
    "in their stacking analysis , @xcite find that their estimates of source counts from lower angular resolution data are much lower than those of @xcite , which are derived from much higher angular resolution data .",
    "they conclude that the disagreement is likely due to count corrections made for partial resolution of extended sources in the high - resolution 1.4ghz beam .",
    "survey catalogs are complete to a fixed brightness cutoff ( flux per beam ) , so extended sources with lower brightnesses but higher integrated flux densities will be missed / under - represented in the beam .",
    "the corrections needed to convert source brightnesses to source flux densities ( as well to account for missing sources ) become quite large near the brightness cutoff as the angular resolution approaches the median angular size of faint sources . as flux goes as @xmath467 , if these corrections happened to be too large , they might end up contributing to much larger apparent source luminosities at higher redshifts with a similar evolution to what we observe here .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the conclusions of @xcite are largely based on the comparison of the source counts derived in @xcite ; no other study ( including k11 ) has found source counts at the low end that are as high ( a. karim , priv .",
    "in addition , the radio disagreements appear to be systematic , rather than isolated to any particular study .",
    "this would imply that the wide variety of different stacking procedures used in d09 , p09 , and k11 ( see also @xcite )  which are in excellent agreement with each other  are all overestimating source counts , which seems unlikely . as a result",
    ", ultimately we remain unsure which ( if any ) of the above explanations are the likely cause of the observed @xmath184 systematic offset between radio - based sfrs compared to sfrs derived from other indicators .",
    "there are several possible interpretations of the relatively constant @xmath242 values indicated by cross - correlational sfr - indicator studies .",
    "the first would be that one of the sfr indicators ( e.g. , h@xmath12 ) is intrinsically more reliable than the others ( taking the differences in the relative timescales probed into account ) , and thus should be taken as having very little internal scatter compared to the rest .",
    "however , the fact that all indicators seem to share similar @xmath242 values seems to imply that the intrinsic scatter for most is around equivalent ( @xmath468dex ) ; otherwise , they should display smaller scatter when being compared with h@xmath12 versus how much they display relative to each other . this would then imply that the data measured with said sfr indicator should have intrinsically less scatter than those measured via other means , and should be more representative of the population .",
    "if we ignore the discrepant smaller @xmath45 scatters ( see @xcite and k13 for discussions on extinction - corrected uv sfrs often used by @xmath45 studies ; see also  [ subsubsec : bzk ] ) , we find that on average the h@xmath12 indicators have less scatter , with @xmath469 compared to @xmath241 0.3 - 0.35 for other sources .",
    "however , the fact that these observations , which not only span different times but also differently sized time bins , show similar scatter is concerning , since as noted above there should nt be effects like this unless they apply to all bins equally .",
    "a casual inspection shows that this is nt true , and that scatters range both relative to @xmath5 and @xmath228 , in seemingly an uncorrelated way , which tends to rule out this idea .",
    "for instance , we can assume that , due to better observational constraints , on average h@xmath12-based studies have less scatter than uv or ir ones ( as we observe in so14 s data ) , with @xmath470 .",
    "we can then assume that @xmath430 has an intrinsic scatter ( e.g. , from internal galaxy properties and observational errors ) that is @xmath471dex .",
    "we pick fiducial values ranging from @xmath472@xmath417dex ( @xmath313@xmath473dex ) .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic scatter among the other observables ranges should range from @xmath474@xmath475dex , in order to satisfy to @xmath476dex constraint we observe . adding these in quadrature",
    ", we get that the _ minimum _",
    "@xmath229 must range between 0.32 and 0.39dex .",
    "the former ( the generous case ) is already in tension with several data points , and the latter contradicts most others . since this is in tension with both the observations listed here and cross - correlation conclusions , we reject this hypothesis .",
    "we also construct this same argument for all the other sfr indicators ( when possible ) , and reach similar conclusions .",
    "thus , there does not seem to be one superior sfr indicator which displays smaller internal scatter among the data collected here .",
    "alternately , we can assume that the observed scatter in each study ( i.e. ms observation ) is almost entirely the result of the scatter among the sfr indicator ( i.e. that the sfr indicator scatter is completely unrelated to internal galaxy properties ) .",
    "this then implies almost perfectly synchronous evolution among objects in a given mass bin , which seems unreal given that range of ages that these studies are covering .",
    "simple differences in formation times due to , e.g. , @xcite , should generate an intrinsic dispersion among sfrs unless evolution was rapidly convergent before / during the era of highest sfr activity ( @xmath477 ; @xcite ) to within @xmath478 dex .",
    "this would imply that galaxies are synchronous enough to be considered ( with proper calibration ) standard candles !",
    "it would also imply that the processes that trigger and drive star formation are completely deterministic , and dominate at all times over stochastic processes like mergers ( at least while galaxies are on the ms ) .",
    "we reject this line of reasoning due to the concerns mentioned earlier in this section , namely that if @xmath476dex among all indicators , there must be intrinsic scatter among each indicator , and so this situation can not be viable .",
    "we could also assume the other extreme , that the scatter among sfr indicators is in fact completely due to internal galaxy properties ( e.g. , metallicity ) that modify the observed emission , rather than the indicators themselves .",
    "cross - correlational studies also seem to rule the extreme version of this hypothesis out , although the results from s12 ( see their table  1 ) seem to imply that this must be true at least to some extent .",
    "while empirical indicators that can be used to cross - check sed - fitted masses have not been established , it is nonetheless possible to evaluate the intrinsic scatter by comparing different mass determinations that have been derived using the same data and fitting procedures ( so that the only difference is interpreting the final output ) .",
    "we opt to do this using the two masses taken from so14 ( d. sobral , priv . comm . ) , who derive their masses ( see appendix  [ app : data ] ) using two different procedures .",
    "the first uses the most common method of taking the mass from the best - fitting sed , used in all studies included in this work ( @xmath479 ) .",
    "the second involves taking the median of all the masses that have been derived from fits that lie within 1@xmath2 parameter space of the best - fitting sed ( @xmath480 ) .    as expected , while the `` best - fit '' mass and the `` median '' mass tend to be tightly correlated , the best - fit mass is very sensitive to small changes in the parameter space and/or error estimations , while the median mass tends to be robust against such variations ( so14 ) .",
    "we find that the correlation between the two mass estimates for all the galaxies included in the hizels dataset ( 3004 ) is well parameterized by a linear fit in log - log space , where @xmath481 and @xmath482dex .",
    "this fit covers @xmath483@xmath484 and @xmath485@xmath262 , and has been fit using the both same procedures outlined in st14 and appendix  [ app : data ] as well as just a standard fit to all the data points ( the differences are negligible ) .",
    "this relationship is not 1:1 , likely due to the sensitivity of the best - fit mass to the grid space and fitting procedures leading to nonlinear dependencies . in principle , the relation between the two could vary even more if different ( and more ) models are used in the sed fitting process .",
    "we find that the average median mass is @xmath3dex smaller than the best - fit mass , which suggests that while larger masses tend to be favored by the best fit , somewhat smaller masses are in fact more common among most of the fits that are only marginally worse than the best fit .",
    "there is also evidence for possible variations in the @xmath479@xmath480 relation over time .",
    "splitting up our sample into the four subsamples used in so14 , the slopes for the @xmath486 @xmath487 , @xmath488 @xmath489 , @xmath490 @xmath491 , and @xmath436 @xmath492 samples are @xmath493 , @xmath494 , @xmath495 , and @xmath496 , respectively . at fixed mass ( @xmath497 ) ,",
    "the differences in mass , @xmath498 , are @xmath499 and @xmath500 , respectively . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the relationship is generally steeper ( i.e. , they agree more at higher masses ) and the differences between the two mass estimates smaller , while at higher redshifts the relationship is shallower ( i.e. , agrees more at lower masses ) and the disagreements somewhat larger ( @xmath33dex vs. @xmath1dex ) .    directly comparing the ms relations from these two mass estimates , in all cases the scatter is lower among studies which use the median masses",
    "for the @xmath501 and @xmath436 samples , the scatter ( in dex ) around the best fit decreases from 0.49 , 0.25 , 0.23 , and 0.24 to 0.43 , 0.21 , 0.21 , and 0.20 .",
    "if the median masses are more accurate indicators of the true mass , then these decreases give some indication of the intrinsic scatter ( or at least , some sense of an upper bound ) present in sed - fitted masses . assuming that this intrinsic scatter has been subtracted in quadrature from the original scatter in much the same way that this work has done for the sfrs ( see [ app : sfr_disc ] ) , these correspond to intrinsic scatters ( dex ) of 0.23 , 0.14 , 0.09 , and 0.13 . in the worst case",
    ", this indicates that the intrinsic scatter in mass is comparable to that in sfr ; in the best case , it s slightly lower , at around @xmath1@xmath502dex",
    ".    given our findings , while the median masses do indeed seem to be more robust than the best - fit masses , the exact relationship between the two ( and its time dependence ) is uncertain .",
    "the methodology also looks promising to derive more robust estimates of other sed parameters such as sfrs , stellar ages , etc . , and might also serve as an alternate way to estimate the errors on the output parameters .",
    "all of these should be further explored by future studies .",
    "as can be seen both from the median @xmath503 s and the errors on the fit , our method as a whole is robust both in time and in mass .",
    "the small @xmath503 s , in most cases @xmath504 , provides additional support that most ms observations are consistent with each other .",
    "no matter how accurate our results seem to be , however , there always is the risk that we might ignore important systematics present within our fitting procedure . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the effects various changes in our fitting parameters affect our result .",
    "as can be seen in tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fits_z ] , a simple average over ms observations while ignoring mass information tends to hide possible differential mass evolution when fitting to all the data , as selection effects mainly cancel each other out .",
    "we find that for the majority of our fits , there is @xmath505 evidence for differential mass evolution ( i.e. different rates of time evolution at fixed stellar mass for different masses , or @xmath506 has a nonzero @xmath507 ) .",
    "these are sometimes as high as @xmath508dex per gyr , but more typically are @xmath509dex per gyr .",
    "these negative @xmath507 s suggest more rapid mass evolution occurring for higher masses and seem to match the observed changes in slope . by contrast , some extrapolated fits provide evidence for _ positive _",
    "@xmath507 s , which would imply more rapid @xmath201 evolution of _ lower_-mass objects ( at fixed mass ) rather than higher - mass ones , in contrast to the lower slopes we seem to observe .",
    "in general , our calibrated sfrs show smaller interpublication scatters ( @xmath503 ) ( typically @xmath1@xmath58dex ) than their uncalibrated counterparts , and are @xmath510dex smaller than the interpublication scatters between ssfr observations included in @xcite ( around @xmath33dex ) .",
    "they also display less time - dependencies in the ms slopes @xmath17 : while both sets of data display similar slopes at @xmath28 , uncorrected data shows steeper slopes ( and slightly smaller absolute sfrs ) at higher redshifts .",
    "given the robustness of our fitting procedure and the improved results after adjusting results to our common calibration , we choose to exclude the uncorrected and mass - independent fits from further analysis .",
    "we now shift our discussion to our varying minimum threshold for the number of objects we opt to include for each mass bin ( @xmath196 ) , and how altering the minimum threshold can affect our results . as can be seen from table  [ tab : fits ] , within each cut variations in n tend to only shift the @xmath511 by a maximum of @xmath240 , and more typically @xmath1dex . we do not discuss the other parameters extensively here because they all tend to be degenerate .",
    "changes in @xmath511 are compensated by changes in @xmath507 , and usually in @xmath512 and @xmath513 ( @xmath514 ) as well since they re all fitting the same data ( and tend to fit them about equally well , if the median @xmath503 values are taken at face value ) .",
    "the overall evolution of the ms ultimately remains about the same .",
    "the main reasons why these changes are nonzero have to due with biases towards overweighting individual studies .",
    "as we include several studies with multiple data points and large mass ranges ( s09 ; o10 ) , having a low @xmath196 tends to lead to biases towards these data points near the edges of the mass ranges , pushing them downwards / upwards on the low / high mass side ( such as with the mixed fits ) .",
    "this effect more generally also is more prominent in cuts with less points overall , where a small number of data points can change some of the specifics of the fit more than they would otherwise ( such as the fir , stacked fits or the uv , non - stacked fits ) .    for very high @xmath196 , this change comes about because of the reduced mass ranges that meet our criteria .",
    "since we have restricted much of the dynamical range by design , fewer studies are consequently moving in and out of our mass bins .",
    "this makes our mass - dependent fit more similar to our extrapolated fits as we lose some of our mass - dependence from the slope / normalization averaging process .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : fits ] , our extrapolated fits tend to find less time evolution ( @xmath515 ) in the ms slope . due to the degeneracy of @xmath507 with @xmath511 , this leads to an overall decrease in @xmath511 as well .",
    "this effect is best approximated when there are lots of data points included in the fit ; due to the sensitive nature of fits with a small number of data points ( @xmath516 observations ) , this effect might be quite different and sensitive to the individual data points ( and their parent studies ) included in the fit . in order to balance robustness",
    "while keeping a large enough dynamical range , we advocate only using fits where @xmath517 and the total number of data points is @xmath518 .",
    "all other fits should be used cautiously .",
    "so far , we have limited this discussion to our ms@xmath519 fits from table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "however , they also hold for our ms@xmath316 fits from table  [ tab : fits_z ] . in order to decide which functional form of the ms",
    "provides a superior fit to the data , we turn our attention towards functional robustness , interpublication scatters , and a direct comparison . in terms of robustness , we find that the ms(@xmath140 ) functional form is about as robust as the ms(@xmath5 ) one in terms of the quality of the fits themselves , with both methods having similar orders of errors and variances . in most cases , however , the errors on the ms(@xmath140 ) fit ( especially for the power law index ) are fractionally larger than the ms(@xmath5 ) one .",
    "in addition , we note that the ms(@xmath140 ) fit is not stable with respect to @xmath196 , with the power - law index changing drastically with variations in @xmath196 for the same cuts .    for interpublication scatters",
    ", we find that on average @xmath520 is @xmath521@xmath522dex greater than @xmath523 . as both functions are fitting the same set of data , higher @xmath520 values seem to indicate that the chosen ms(@xmath140 ) parametrization is less effective than the ms(@xmath5 ) one at fitting the data .",
    "we also find that it serves as a worse predictor for high-@xmath140 ms observations compared to the ms@xmath519 forms plotted in figures  [ fig : sfr_t_relations_selection ] ,  [ fig : sfr_t_relations ] , and  [ fig : m105ri ] , leading to differences in sfr at fixed mass ( @xmath524 ) of several tenths of a dex at @xmath525 , and of @xmath1dex at @xmath28 . while it does provide reasonable fits to within the range to which it has been applied , the failures to extrapolate ms(@xmath140 ) to higher redshifts where it severely overpredicts available data leads us to favor the ms(@xmath5 ) case .",
    "we thus deem the ms(@xmath140 ) fits inferior to the ms(@xmath5 ) ones ( i.e. , time - dependent parametrizations of the ms are superior to redshift - dependent ones ) , and will focus our discussion in this discussion on the latter .    as can be seen from the fits in  [ subsec : ms_evol ] and in tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fits_z ] , excluding the radio data ( @xmath526 observations ; 3 studies ) from the analysis shifts the fit towards larger amounts of time evolution in the slope .",
    "however , after removing all stacked data ( which also removes the stacked ir observations of o10 ) , we find that the fit does not change substantially , indicating that the radio data are not biased relative to their other stacked counterparts .",
    "relative to the mixed data , the fit which includes all available data points also tends to favor increased time evolution .",
    "this is because of the dichotomy in slopes between mixed and bluer data illustrated in figure  [ fig : slope_selection ] . as most uv observations are centered at high redshift ( as fir data are unavailable ) , this biases the average slopes ( and sfrs ) at these redshifts and increases the slope evolution towards low redshift where these observations are less prevalent .",
    "this behavior becomes especially apparent looking at the fit for only the bluer data , whose best fit indicates a general slope _",
    "increase _ over time .",
    "the subsets for observations for specific sfr indicators display much of the same trends .",
    "for uv ( sfr ) data , the problem is worse due to the decreased sample size , and gives a best fit that implies a slope of significantly greater than unity at late times . for combined uv+ir and ir ( sfr ) data ,",
    "the strong evolution in the slope is due to a combination of r12 s lbgs at higher redshift biasing the slopes upwards and the strong redshift evolution present in observations such as w12 .",
    "these are the same problems that characterize the fit that included all observations .",
    "finally , looking at the @xmath184-corrected radio observations relative to their uncorrected counterparts , we find that the main differences between the two data sets is their time evolution , as expected .",
    "to estimate possible errors in our msi tracks due to our assumption of an initial seed mass of @xmath527 , we examine msi tracks generated by smaller seed masses of @xmath528 and @xmath14@xmath40 . in order to arrive at the same final masses as our original seed mass , these new seed masses require earlier formation times , with average offsets of @xmath354 and @xmath132gyr , respectively . these indicate that it takes @xmath529@xmath530myr to grow @xmath531 assuming continuous ms - like star formation , or an average sfr of @xmath236@xmath532yr@xmath41 . as galaxies as high as @xmath0 ( @xmath533myr )",
    "are observed to have masses of @xmath534 ( l12 ; @xcite ; st14 ) , this level of growth seems insufficient to generate some of the massive sfgs in the extremely early universe ( and also seems to indicate significant amounts of mass assembly @xmath535 must place in bursts ) .",
    "indeed , even assuming @xmath536 and @xmath537 , we are just barely able to generate galaxies on the order of @xmath538 by @xmath539 . in order to account for possible ( albeit unlikely ) ms - like mass growth",
    ", we investigate adding @xmath540myr age offsets to our stellar mass loss prescriptions . these lead to sfrs on the order of @xmath541@xmath542yr@xmath41 , which seem reasonable given the gas densities and merger rates in the very early universe .",
    "we find this offset leads to variations in the final mass on the order of a few percent , the same level of uncertainty inherent in the approximation itself @xcite .",
    "the results of reported here do not change if we include this additional age / growth component .    besides initial seed mass , other results from msi ( e.g. , sfhs ) can also sensitive to the assumed evolution of the ms . in order to investigate the impact different parametrized ms evolutions might play in our msi procedure",
    ", we calculate tracks for several of our best fits presented in table  [ tab : best_fits ] .",
    "we find that for most measurements , the variations in formation times ( assuming a fixed initial seed mass ) vary between 510% while sfrs at any given time / mass vary by @xmath1dex .",
    "this is due to the fact that the actual sfr of a ms galaxy at any given mass and time is very similar across most of the studies compiled here  most apparent differences in evolution ( e.g. , the strong evolution in slope from w12 compared to the relatively steep slopes found other studies at similar redshifts ) are almost entirely offset by the derived evolution of other parameters ( see figure  [ fig : sfr_t_relations ] ) . for radio - based measurements ,",
    "however , the differences can be more significant ( formation times varying by @xmath315 , sfhs by several tenths of a dex ) , although the exact magnitude depends on the final mass of the galaxy .",
    "based on these considerations , we conclude our results are relatively robust to the exact form of the ms .",
    "this also implies that while specific quantities reported in other msi - based analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ) might have larger systematic errors than reported , their main conclusions should be unaffected .",
    "since we have excluded the first and last 2gyr of data from our fits , at lower redshifts we have the ability to examine what differing fitting techniques , sample selection , and other systematic effects have on the determination of ms fits .",
    "we find different parameters from e07 , z12 , c09 , and s07 ( in order of increasing median redshifts ) , all of which have used sdss data from dr4 @xcite with the exception of z12 and c14 , who use dr7 @xcite and their own individual methods to determine ms relations for @xmath388 galaxies ( see appendix  [ app : data ] ) . as a separate check",
    ", we also compare these results to those of o10 ( swire ) .",
    "all listed parameters will be for e07 , z12 , c14 , c09 , s07 , and o10 , respectively , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "we first examine the slopes of the individual ms determinations . for these six studies ,",
    "we find @xmath543 , and @xmath544 . excluding c09 and c14 as before",
    ", we see that ms slopes for ( essentially ) the same sample range from 0.77 to 0.65 .",
    "this wide range in the @xmath10@xmath9 behavior is much larger than the single quoted error ( the only ones provided are @xmath545 ) , and so we can easily conclude that ( excluding selection differences ) systematic errors on the order of @xmath1dex or larger dominate the ms slope error budget at these low redshifts . even when comparing results which used the same sfr indicators ( e07 and z12 use h@xmath12 , while s07 and c14 use sed - fitted values ) or sps models ( s07 , z12 , and c14 use bc03 ) , the variation in slope is still @xmath546@xmath58 . as an independent check on the validity of any of the slopes listed here , o10",
    "s data gives a slope on the higher end of the other low-@xmath140 estimates ( 0.77 ) .",
    "we note that our extrapolated slope at @xmath547 is @xmath132 , in better agreement with c14 s observed slope rather than those of e07 and z12 .",
    "we next examine the normalizations ( at @xmath548 and @xmath549 ) for the samples . for these six studies , @xmath550 and @xmath551 , and @xmath552 and @xmath553 . at lower masses ,",
    "the agreement among the different studies is good , with @xmath554 ranging from -0.59 to -0.40 ( excluding c09 and c14 , who both display much higher values ) .",
    "again , the absolute sfr among studies with the same sfr indicator ( e07 and z12 ) differ by @xmath1dex .",
    "the variation is larger , however , among the studies with the same sps models ( @xmath3dex ) , which seems to indicate that the sfr indicator is a more important driver for differences rather than sps model .",
    "we also find that the sfrs derived from o10 are @xmath3dex lower than even s07 s .",
    "so while the slopes are identical between o10 and e07 , the absolute normalizations differ by @xmath33dex .",
    "thus a comparison in slope is not enough to determine the robustness of any ms measurement",
    " normalizations ( especially relative normalizations ) should be taken into account .    at @xmath555 , however , we get a slightly diferent picture . here , while sfrs derived from h@xmath12 ( e07 and z12 ) and those derived from other methods ( absorption lines , sed fitting , and ir for c09 , s07/c14 , and o10 , respectively ) exhibit good agreement within each group ( @xmath556dex ; c14 , which straddles both groups , is the exception ) , they are offset by @xmath3dex from each other .",
    "in other words , sfrs derived from h@xmath12 tend to be systematically higher than those derived through other means .",
    "while this tendency is true over the entire fitted mass range , it becomes most severe ( due to the steeper slopes ) at higher mass .",
    "we find that the sfrs provided by our best fits tend to favor the h@xmath12 sfrs for @xmath557 or so , and prefer the other studies for higher masses .",
    "this trend is similar to that seen at high redshift , and probably indicates a similar problem either with extinction corrections or selection effects at high and low masses .",
    "alternately , it could indicate systematic variations in the sed fitting procedure ( perhaps due to sfh or other parameters ) at higher and/or lower masses ( see also st14 ) .",
    "the wide range in fitted ms slopes and normalizations suggest that many of the systematics involved in determining ms parameters have been severely underestimated .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of these effects on the ms slope to be of order @xmath3 or larger using just the data included here , in good agreement with @xcite , although we note that if we include other slopes from the literature ( e.g. , b04 measures a slope of @xmath558 ) the differences might be as large as @xmath31 .",
    "as noted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , a ms slope of less than unity implies that the slope @xmath559 of the sf mass function below the characteristic mass @xmath10 should steepen with time .",
    "more explicitly , @xcite argue that the observed constancy of @xmath560 and @xmath559 for sfgs implies that the quenching of galaxies around and above @xmath560 must be proportional to their sfrs . as the shape of the mass function appears to be relatively unchanged since @xmath23 @xcite , the fact that the majority of our results give ms slopes significantly less than unity and display time - dependent evolution even further away from unity could be seen as somewhat concerning .",
    "as we have spent a significant portion of this work arguing the robustness of our fitting procedure and the widespread agreement among ms observations , we would like to spend some time discussing this possible problem .    as argued by @xcite , the below - unity slope of the ms may in large part due to studies failing to separate out bulge and disk components of their constituent galaxies . by analyzing only the disk components of sfgs at @xmath28 , they find the slope of this `` disk - limited '' ms ( ms@xmath561 ) is approximately unity .",
    "they then propose that this new approximately unity ms@xmath561 slope solves the steepening mass function problem if one makes the reasonable assumption that mass - growth is dominated by _ in situ _ disk sf .",
    "as noted in appendix  [ app : low_z ] , the systematics in deriving a ms slope are extremely large ( as high as @xmath31 ) , even when using the same dataset ( i.e. sdss ) . consequently , one might assume that these errors overwhelm all ms slopes measured in this literature .",
    "if this is the case , all ms observations ( excluding non - selective ones ) included in this work could technically be seen as consistent with slopes of @xmath562 ( indeed , many seem to cluster around @xmath16@xmath563 at a wide range of redshifts ) , and our results as consistent with a scenario where the ms slope out to @xmath23 is approximately constant and the ms@xmath561 slope is approximately unity . as a result , @xmath559 would remain unchanged over the same redshift range , in agreement with observations . while we can not refute such a view as we are ultimately uncertain how large a role systematics play in ms observations , we find this position unfavorable given the good results from , e.g. , so14 at reproducing the csfr out to @xmath32 .",
    "alternately , we note that while most of our ms fits imply some form of time - dependent ms slope , some of our ms fits ( e.g. those which include only stacked , mixed ms observations ) give time - independent parametrizations with slopes similar to those seen in @xcite .",
    "although many of these are derived from smaller , more selective subsets of the ms observations included here , it is fully possible that they are a more accurate parametrization of ms evolution . once future observations at low-@xmath140",
    "can rigorously demonstrate that their ms slopes are robust and agree on appropriate selection criteria for differentiating between sf and quiescent galaxies , their results should be able to serve as additional constraints on the fits we provide here and hopefully provide a concrete answer to the apparent tension in the data .",
    "many acronyms are used throughout the paper in our discussions of concepts and issues surrounding the sfg ms , some used only once or twice , and others much more frequently . for convenience ,",

    "<S> using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature , we investigate the evolution of the star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) main sequence ( ms ) in stellar mass and star formation rate ( sfr ) out to @xmath0 . after converting all observations to a common set of calibrations , we find a remarkable consensus among ms observations ( @xmath1 dex 1@xmath2 interpublication scatter ) . by fitting for time evolution of the ms in bins of constant mass , </S>",
    "<S> we deconvolve the observed scatter about the ms within each observed redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> after accounting for observed scatter between different sfr indicators , we find the width of the ms distribution is @xmath3 dex and remains constant over cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> our best fits indicate the slope of the ms is likely time - dependent , with our best fit @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the age of the universe in gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain ms galaxy star formation histories ( sfhs ) , finding that ( 1 ) the most accurate representations of ms sfhs are given by delayed-@xmath6 models , ( 2 ) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a `` typical '' ms galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime , and ( 3 ) scatter about the ms can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial @xmath7 spread in formation times of @xmath8 gyr . </S>"
