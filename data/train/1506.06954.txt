    "a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical works @xcite have studied the scattering phase shift in low dimensional mesoscopic systems where the electron dynamics is determined by quantum mechanics . essentially , the asymptotic states are that of free particles in a quantum wire and the scatterer is embedded in the path of this quantum wire @xcite . model specific approach",
    "so far has led to contradictory and confusing results @xcite .",
    "heiblum et al @xcite quote that ` there is by now vast theoretical evidence that the transmission phase depends on the specific properties of the qd s levels that participate in the transport ' .",
    "however , in all these studies there is no reference to well established theorems and results on discontinuous phase changes and lapses known for a long time in the community that studies classical wave trains @xcite .",
    "such phase changes are still very important in mesoscopic physics as they are related to breakdown of parity effect @xcite , interpretation of friedel sum rule ( fsr ) @xcite , relation to partial density of states ( pdos ) @xcite , etc .",
    "that determine the thermodynamic properties of a mesoscopic system which is absent in case of classical waves .",
    "so in this work we first recapitulate why the scattering phase shift can be discontinuous as a result of burgers circuit and",
    "then further use burgers circuit to show its exact relation to density of states and partial density of states . namely we can prove the reality of negative pdos and prove the general regimes when semi classical fsr can be exact in a purely quantum regime .",
    "the advantage of using burgers circuit is that these results can be shown to be very general and thus goes beyond all earlier works .    besides we will show that the scattering phase shift behaviour of different experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite studied mesoscopic systems",
    "can be understood from the argand diagrams and analyticity .",
    "each such system has its own peculiarities and so it is important to understand them with respect to a mathematical principle like burgers circuit .",
    "argand diagram for the scattering matrix element of these systems can be classified as , a ) argand diagram is closed , b ) argand diagram is open , c ) argand diagram encloses the phase singularity , d ) argand diagram does not enclose the phase singularity , e ) argand diagram is simply connected and f ) argand diagram is multiply connected due to the presence of sub - loops .",
    "specific properties of the scatterer only matter to the extent that the argand diagram changes from one of these to another . among them",
    "some changes are topologically possible and others are not . understanding how an argand diagram changes from one to the other explains most of the puzzles .    in section [ model ] we will analyse slips in the scattering phase shift @xcite . in section [ inj ]",
    "we will show that fsr too can be understood from argand diagrams although its manifestation seems to be completely different for different potentials @xcite .",
    "we will also show why fsr can become exact whenever there is a phase lapse .",
    "this is a physically counter - intuitive result that has been proven for particular potentials so far @xcite .",
    "we will show that this result depends on the properties of argand diagram and hence very general and independent of the scattering potential .",
    "in section [ inj ] we will use burgers circuit to prove the possibility of negative partial density of states in real mesoscopic systems . to show negative pdos by explicit calculation for any particular realistic potential",
    "is virtually impossible and so never shown before .",
    "argand diagram is a plot of real versus imaginary parts of an analytic complex function and burgers circuit is about phase changes and lapses being determined by phase singularities . given a complex function @xmath0 , if there is a phase singularity @xcite in its complex plane , then one can specify the strength of the singularity as follows @xcite , @xmath1 @xmath2 is a topological quantum number which is always conserved in an interaction .",

    "a scattering matrix element is a complex function for which argand diagram can be drawn and concept of bc can be applied . for the rest of the paper where we refer to scattering matrix element",
    ", we will mean the scattering matrix element of a quantum mechanical particle say an electron .",
    "argand diagram for a scattering matrix element is generally counter - clockwise , as incident energy of the scattering particle increases . at the phase singularity , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , implying the phase singularity is at the origin",

    "[ f1](a ) , shows a typical counter - clockwise contour ( abdea ) of an argand diagram enclosing the phase singularity at the origin .",
    "hence for this case , @xmath14 .",
    "the contour trajectory ( abdea ) is concave throughout with respect to the singular point at the origin .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , the net change in phase in tracing abdea , in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) , is 2@xmath15 .",
    "thus the phase monotonously increases for a concave trajectory .",
    "[ f1](b ) shows a typical contour ( fghjf ) of an argand diagram not enclosing the phase singularity at the origin .",
    "hence for this case , @xmath16 .",
    "the contour has both concave ( fgh ) and convex ( hjf ) trajectories with respect to the singular point at the origin .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , the total change in phase in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) is zero .",
    "it is possible if the phase increases for the concave trajectory and decreases for the convex trajectory , the net phase change being zero .",
    "this can be easily verified by calculating @xmath17 at any point ( @xmath18 ) of the trajectory and will be further demonstrated below .",
    "thus for both figs . [ f1](a ) and [ f1](b ) , the phase change is determined by the singular point and the two follow the same principle . as a special case of the two , one can have a situation where the contour touches the singular point .",
    "in which case too the phase change can be understood from the same principle and will be explained later . also if it is a closed contour as in figs .",
    "[ f1](a ) and [ f1](b ) , then eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) is exact . in the real systems we will discuss in this work",
    ", the contours may not be closed .",
    "however , we will extend eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) to understand such cases too .",
    "whatever be the shape of a closed contour @xmath10 , the phase change is given by eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) . as a consequence , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0 are not independent of each other but are related .",
    "let us say the complex transmission amplitude be @xmath19 where @xmath20 can be any parameter like incident energy or gate voltage .",
    "then @xmath21 @xmath22 these are the well known kramers - kronig relations @xcite .",
    "another way in which the relation can be stated is in terms of hilbert transform @xcite , @xmath23 @xmath24 since @xmath3 is a conserved quantity , by adding terms to a hamiltonian ( or details to the states in the scatterer ) we can not remove the phase singularities of the wave function in the complex plane .",
    "phase changes are determined by the phase singularities .",
    "depending on the interaction the argand diagram can however change and so a theoretical understanding of the experimental data may not crucially depend on the details of the sample or model .",
    "sample details can change the shape of the contour @xmath10 , but as these theorems state , to understand the phase changes , we do not need all these details .",
    "englman and yahalom @xcite had shown that the experimental data for scattering phase shift and scattering cross section of a quantum dot , are consistent with hilbert transforms .",
    "we will show that the principles of analyticity and eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) can be used to arrive at our results .",
    "in this section we analyse scattering phase shifts for different potentials that has been theoretically studied @xcite so far , for analysing the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "we intend to analyse w.r.t eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) which has not been done in earlier works .",
    "again as explained with eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , we do not need very complicated realistic potentials to understand the phase shifts but we need representative potentials that can be exactly solved and help us understand different aspects of eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) .",
    "let us first consider scattering by a double delta function potential in one dimension ( 1d ) schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , that was studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "although a simple potential , it exhibits pronounced breit wigner ( bw ) resonances .",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) to understand the scattering phase shift for this system and hence for bw resonances .",
    "the scattering potential for this system can be written as , @xmath25 @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the strengths of potential @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the wave function in different regions marked @xmath31 and @xmath32 are ( see fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) ) , @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath13 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes , @xmath35 is the wave vector and @xmath36 is incident fermi energy .",
    "@xmath37 , where , @xmath38 is transmission phase shift and @xmath39 is transmission modulus . the argand diagram for @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) , where energy is varied to remain within the first riemann surface .",
    "there is a phase singularity at the origin where @xmath40 .",
    "the argand diagram encloses the singularity but is not closed in the first riemann surface . figs . [ f2](c ) and [ f2](d ) shows the transmission phase shift @xmath41 and the transmission coefficient @xmath42 , respectively , as a function of @xmath43 , using the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) , the contour starts from the origin where @xmath44 , goes first through point @xmath45 and then through @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the trajectory facing the singular point at the origin is concave throughout , and thus as discussed with fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the phase increases continuously .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ f2](c ) where the points @xmath48 and @xmath47 are also shown at their respective values of @xmath43 .",
    "as the trajectory comes closer to the point of phase singularity , phase changes are very small and energy cost is very high . in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) , the energy at the points marked @xmath48 and @xmath47 are 8.614@xmath49 , 9.12@xmath49 , 23.61@xmath49 and 37.58@xmath49 .",
    "thus the energy change in going from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( a large arc in the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) ) is very small , whereas the energy change in going from @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( a small arc in the trajectory in fig . [ f2](b ) ) is very high .",
    "the point @xmath52 is very close to the singular point .",
    "thus it costs a lot of energy as the argand diagram trajectory tries to approach the point of phase singularity .",
    "another scattering potential often studied @xcite to understand the experiments @xcite is known as the stub , which is an infinite one - dimensional quantum wire with a finite side branch . a schematic representation of this system is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) .",
    "this system is topologically not the same as a one dimensional system , as in this case the origin @xmath8 ( see fig . [ f3](a ) ) is connected to three other directions .",
    "this potential shows discontinuous phase drops by @xmath53 @xcite similar to that observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "prior to that this discontinuous scattering phase shift was shown to cause breakdown of parity effect of single particle states @xcite . however ,",
    "if there is an energy scale associated with such a sharp phase change has remained a puzzle @xcite .",
    "heiblum et al @xcite quote that ` the appearance of a second energy scale in the phase jump between resonances also can not be understood ... ' .",
    "they also mention that it suggests existence of an unusually large energy scale .",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) to understand why scattering phase shift can change discontinuously as some parameter is varied .",
    "electrons are incident from left ( see fig . [ f3](a ) ) with energy @xmath36 .",
    "the thin lines represent one dimensional quantum wires with zero potential , while the bold line represents quantum wire with a finite potential @xmath54 given by , @xmath55 the potential @xmath54 is taken to be imaginary , as it allows us to make the argand diagram trajectory approach and cross the point of phase singularity .",
    "this can not be done with real potentials as @xmath3 in eq .",

    "if the system changes from a closed one to an open one then @xmath3 may be different for the two cases .",

    "[ f3](b ) show the argand diagrams for the transmission amplitudes , given by eq .",
    "( [ eight ] ) , for different values of @xmath66 , where energy is varied to remain within the first riemann surface .",
    "the thick solid line is for @xmath67 , the dot - dashed line is for @xmath68 and the dashed line is for @xmath69 .",
    "there is a phase singularity at @xmath40 marked as @xmath47 in fig .",

    "[ f3](b ) , if we draw a circle ( thin solid line through @xmath72 ) around the phase singularity , then eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) implies the total phase change along the contour is @xmath73 .",
    "if the shape and size of the contour is altered , the net phase change along the contour remains the same provided the contour encircles the phase singularity .",
    "the phase change while going from @xmath74 to @xmath75 along the arrow in the contour is less than @xmath53 as the phase change in going from @xmath76 to @xmath77 is @xmath53 . in the limit when the radius of the circle @xmath78 is tending to zero ,",
    "@xmath50 approaches @xmath77 , @xmath51 approaches @xmath79 and @xmath78 all coincide with the singular point @xmath80 . in this limit going from @xmath74 to @xmath75 would imply a discontinuous phase change of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore a trajectory that tangentially touches the singular point @xmath80 like the thick solid line for @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) , will exhibit a discontinuous phase change of @xmath53 at @xmath80 .",
    "this phase change can be seen in the solid line for @xmath81 in fig .",

    "[ f3](b ) ) , where we have plotted the transmission phase shift @xmath41 versus @xmath70 .",
    "we have already discussed in the previous section that as the argand diagram trajectory approaches the point of phase singularity , the energy cost is very high .",
    "so , it is surprising that in a mesoscopic system , one can have such a high energy scale and one can realize discontinuous phase drops that are generally not seen for classical wave transport .",
    "in fact , it is not a real energy scale but an effective energy scale .",
    "scattering by a stub of length @xmath82 can be mapped into a problem of a delta function potential in one dimension where the strength of the delta function potential is @xmath83 .",
    "that is , @xmath84 has same reflection amplitude @xmath34 and transmission amplitude @xmath13 as a stub of length @xmath82 .",
    "this is an effective potential that the electrons encounter while the real potential is @xmath85 . at @xmath86 ,",
    "a small change in @xmath87 or @xmath82 means a very large change in the effective potential @xmath88 .",
    "such large effective energy scales are known in other areas of condensed matter physics , for example , the effective electron mass becomes @xmath89 at the band edge .",
    "for @xmath90 , the argand diagram trajectory shown by the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) , intersects the @xmath91 axis at point @xmath92 at @xmath86 .",
    "the argand diagram trajectory facing the phase singularity at @xmath80 is concave throughout .",

    "[ two ] ) implies a monotonously increasing phase .",
    "this phase behaviour can be seen in the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f3](c ) where we have plotted the transmission phase shift @xmath41 versus @xmath70 and marked @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath94 , the argand diagram trajectory shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) , intersects the @xmath91 axis at point @xmath95 at @xmath86 . the argand diagram trajectory facing the phase singularity is partially convex and partially concave .",
    "as discussed with respect to eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , the phase increases for the concave part and decreases for the convex part of the trajectory .",
    "this phase behaviour can be seen in the dashed curve in fig . [",
    "f3](c ) where we have plotted the transmission phase shift @xmath41 versus @xmath70 and marked the point @xmath95 similarly .",
    "therefore , if @xmath96 is continuously changed from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , then the point @xmath92 moves to @xmath95 crossing the point of phase singularity .",
    "when @xmath96 becomes @xmath6 we get the solid curves in figs .",
    "[ f3](b ) , [ f3](c ) and [ f3](d ) this implies that with an imaginary potential , just by changing sign of the potential it is possible to cross the singular point .",
    "@xmath3 for dot - dashed line is 1 and that for the dashed line is 0 . in other words by changing an imaginary potential we can make @xmath3 change from 1 to 0 .",
    "this is difficult with a real potential .",
    "if we tried to cross the singular point with real potentials it would cost an infinite amount of energy .",
    "we have thus discussed an effective real potential that can make an argand diagram trajectory tangentially touch the point of phase singularity .",
    "any effective potential that can make argand diagram trajectory cross the point of phase singularity is not known .    in fig .",
    "[ f3](c ) , we observe two different types of phase drops . for @xmath99 , we get a discontinuous phase drop ( shown by the solid curve in fig . [",
    "f3](c ) ) and for @xmath100 , we get a gradual phase drop ( shown by the dashed curve in fig . [ f3](c ) ) . if we make @xmath101 , the point @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) will shift more to the right and the phase drop will be less in magnitude and also less sharp . in fig .",
    "[ f3](d ) , using the same parameters and same notations as in figs .",

    "the thick solid curve for @xmath99 goes to zero , while the dot - dashed and dashed curves for @xmath104 and @xmath100 respectively , go through a non - zero minima and are very close .",
    "the phase behaviours for dot - dashed and dashed curves are completely different as can be seen from fig .",

    "thus in this section , we have explained using argand diagram and burgers circuit , why phase ( scattering phase shift ) drops can occur discontinuously ?",
    "why such a phase drop can disappear or change from discontinuous to gradual ?",
    "the gradual phase drop in the dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ f3](c ) at @xmath95 is related to the analytic property of complex transmission amplitude and how the trajectory encloses the singularity . whether the gradual drop is sharp or slow , depends on the distance @xmath105 ( fig .",

    "the next scattering potential we consider , is a delta function potential in a single channel quantum wire @xcite .",
    "this essentially means , there is a single propagating channel while all other channels are evanescent .",

    "therefore , the drops in scattering phase shift of mesoscopic system , originating from sub - loops in argand diagram involves completely new physics .",
    "one has to discard the usual concept of semi - classical regimes wherein the de - broglie wavelength of the electron is much smaller than the scale of the potential , mathematically expressed by eq .",
    "( [ buttiker16 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we will try to construct the argand diagram from the experimental data given in refs .",
    "@xcite , to see if something can be understood .",
    "yang ji et al .",
    "@xcite measured the transmission coefficient and transmission phase shift of a quantum dot ( qd ) . the experimentally observed transmission coefficient and transmission phase shift as a function of gate voltage , for different coupling strengths between qd and the leads ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig 8 ] .",
    "a phase drop is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig 8]d when the coupling strength is small .",
    "as coupling gradually increases , the dot enters the strongly interacting regime and the phase drop decreases and finally vanishes .",
    "this gradual phase disappearance follows the sequence d to a in fig .",
    "[ fig 8 ] .",
    "we have seen in our theoretical calculations that such phase drops can disappear and there are two possible reasons .",
    "one possibility is that when the coupling to leads is changed then it introduces some de - coherence for which the argand diagram trajectory crosses the singularity and @xmath3 changes from 0 to 1 .",
    "the second possibility is that @xmath3 remains conserved and the argand diagram trajectory develops a sub - loop .",
    "argand diagrams can be constructed from the experimental data given in fig .",
    "[ fig 8 ] and is shown in fig . [ fig 9 ] .",
    "there is a lot of fluctuations in the data probably due to experimental error .",
    "however , one can roughly see that there is a sub - loop @xmath246 in fig .",
    "[ fig 9 ] , that gradually decreases in area as we go from d to a and clearly disappears in a with the formation of a cusp .",
    "the experimentalists had thought that as coupling increases , kondo effect sets in and the disappearance of phase drop could be due to that .",
    "however , the phase behaviour seen in fig .",
    "[ fig 8]a is not typical of kondo resonance .",
    "typical phase behaviour of kondo resonance is that , it increases by @xmath247 and forms a plateau .",
    "such a behaviour was observed by the same experimental group @xcite subsequently , in which they restricted the dot occupancy to one electron , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig 10](a ) .",
    "one may conclude that the disappearing phase behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig 8]a has nothing to do with kondo effect .",
    "we have already discussed in section  [ inj ] , that when argand diagram of transmission amplitude shows a sub - loop , pdos associated with the transmitting electrons is negative .",
    "the transmitted particles and reflected particles can attract each other and that can result in a bound state .",
    "this bound state is expected to be effective only in the strongly interacting regime , i.e. for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig 8]a . in the weakly interacting regime",
    ", we may not see any effect of this interaction induced bound state and the phase drops occur very generally in scattering by a mesoscopic system .",
    "we hope future experiments will focus on how argand diagram evolves as one observes changes in scattering phase shift .",
    "argand diagram of scattering matrix elements are drawn for different model potentials and for a few experimental data .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from the topology of the argand diagram without referring to the hamiltonian or to the scattering potential . in 1d , 2d and 3d , the argand diagram trajectory encircles the phase singularity .",
    "but in mesoscopic systems we find that the argand diagram develops sub - loops .",
    "the sub - loop does not enclose the phase singularity at the origin and hence topologically allowed .",
    "the sub - loop can therefore appear or disappear on varying some parameter .",
    "it does not matter what parameter ( say @xmath36 ) is varied to obtain the argand diagram or what parameter ( say @xmath242 ) is varied to make the sub - loop disappear .",
    "many unexplained features so far can be explained by the appearance and disappearance of such a sub - loop .",
    "when the sub - loop appears there will be a gradual drop in the scattering phase shift and when the sub - loop disappear the drop will also disappear . hence appearance and disappearance of phase drop is also very natural and poses no conceptual problem . just as the sub - loop appears on varying some parameter",
    ", it can also grow in size as the parameter is varied .",
    "as the sub - loop becomes large and comes closer to the origin the phase drops also become large and sharp making the scattering phase shift decrease to @xmath53 and then injectance or friedel sum rule becomes exact .",
    "this is very counter intuitive as the strong phase drop signifies onset of pure quantum mechanical behaviour while friedel sum rule is expected to become exact in semi - classical regimes .",
    "also we prove that whenever there is a sub - loop ( big or small ) there will be negative partial density of states .",
    "for example if there is a sub - loop in the range @xmath248 then there is also negative partial density of states in the range @xmath248 .",
    "conclusive evidence of negative partial density of sates in a real system has never been reported before . since",
    "all these results are drawn from the properties of the argand diagram , the results are general and independent of the hamiltonian or the scattering potential .",
    "the physics originating from sub - loops is completely new and upsets our way of understanding semi - classical behaviour .",
    "one of us ( psd ) would like to thank prof . sir m. v. berry for useful discussions .",
    "from eq . ( [ buttiker2a ] ) , we can write @xmath249 in eq .",
    "( [ fifteen ] ) using the well known semi classical approximation @xmath250 @xcite , we get , ( see eq .",
    "( [ buttiker3 ] ) ) @xmath251 now , for a contour @xmath204 traced when energy is varied from @xmath6 to @xmath212 , @xmath252",
    "we know that in a scattering problem increasing incident energy by @xmath253 is equivalent to decreasing the potential globally by a constant amount @xmath254 , such that @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is particle charge that we will set to @xmath257 to simplify our arguments .",
    "that is , the new potential is @xmath258 .",
    "hence if we can generate a closed sub - loop in the argand diagram by varying @xmath36 , then we can also do so by globally changing the potential and for such a closed contour like @xmath151 in fig .",
    "[ f7](c ) , @xmath259 now we replace the global integration over @xmath158 by an integration over the sample or the scattering region only , since we have seen that it can be done in case of closed contours or inside an integration of the type @xmath260 in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "this has already been discussed in eq .",
    "( [ buttiker18 ] ) .",
    "@xmath261 therefore , the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) is justified if an electronic charge is multiplied to the numerator .",
