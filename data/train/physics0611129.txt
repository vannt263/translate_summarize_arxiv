    "the compass experiment @xcite at the cern sps investigates key issues in hadron physics by scattering high - energy polarized muons and hadrons off polarized and unpolarized solid state targets .",
    "the produced particles are detected in a large size two - stage forward spectrometer which covers a wide kinematic range ( @xmath8 , @xmath9  ( gev / c)@xmath10 ) .",
    "one of the key features of the compass spectrometer is an excellent particle identification which allows to separate scattered electrons , muons , pions , kaons and protons .",
    "it is performed by electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters , muon walls and a large scale ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite .",
    "the rich detector uses @xmath11 as radiator gas inside a @xmath12  m@xmath10 wide and @xmath13  meter deep vessel .",
    "the produced cherenkov photons are reflected by a @xmath14  m@xmath10 mirror wall onto a set of photon - detectors : up to 2004 multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) with cesium iodide photo - cathodes , covering a total active surface of about @xmath15  m@xmath10 and including in total about 80.000 read - out channels .",
    "the read - out system of the compass rich photon detectors in use till 2004 consisted of gassiplex front - end chips @xcite connected to the mwpcs , which have an integration time of about @xmath13  microseconds . in the experimental environment of the compass setup",
    "there is a large flux of cherenkov photons especially in the centre of the detector , since the cern muon beam is accompanied by 10% to 20% of halo muons which pass through the detector and create cherenkov rings . at high beam intensities of @xmath16 to @xmath17 muons per second , these halo rings create a considerable background of overlapping rings in the centre of the detector , which reduces the particle identification efficiency and purity , especially for particles in the very forward direction .    a fast detection system for cherenkov photons is needed to distinguish by time information the photons originating from scattered particles in the physics events from the background from uncorrelated halo muons .",
    "the upgrade of the compass rich detector consists of two parts . in the central part of the detector ( 25% of the sensitive area ) where the photon flux is largest the mwpcs with cesium iodide photo - cathodes",
    "have been replaced by multi - anode photomultipliers @xcite and a fast read - out system based on the mad4 @xcite discriminator front - end chip and the dead - time free f1 tdc @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ detector ] ) . in the outer part",
    ", the existing mwpc chambers have been equipped with a faster read - out based on the apv preamplifier with sampling adcs @xcite . in addition , the upgraded detector allows a high rate operation at increased trigger rates from @xmath14 up to @xmath2  khz and small dead - time @xcite .",
    "the central region upgrade is performed by replacing the central part of the mwpc photon detector set by an array of 576 uv - sensitive 16 channel multi - anode pmts h7600 - 03-m16 from hamamatsu @xcite .",
    "the sensitive wavelength range of these photomultipliers extends from @xmath18  nm up to @xmath19  nm compared to the effective sensitive range of the cesium - iodide photo - cathodes of @xmath20  nm to @xmath18  nm . therefore the number of detected photons per ring is expected to be about @xmath21 times larger . in addition , the ring resolution is improved by the larger number of detected photons from @xmath22 to @xmath23  mrad .",
    "this will increase the upper limit of the kinematic region of the @xmath24 pion from kaon separation from @xmath25 to above @xmath26  gev / c hadron momentum .",
    "+    [ lenses ]    the cherenkov photons are focused onto the pmts by 576 individual lens telescopes from uv - transparent fused silica lenses ( see fig . [ lenses ] ) .",
    "the telescopes have been customly designed from one spherical and one aspherical lens and offer a large angular acceptance for the photons of @xmath27 and a minimum image distortion .",
    "the image reduction is of a factor of about @xmath28 in area ; the pmt pixels are of @xmath29  mm@xmath10 , the effective pixel size of the new detector is @xmath30  mm@xmath10 .",
    "all pmts have been shielded by soft iron boxes to protect them from the residual @xmath18  gauss field of the @xmath31  tesla open spectrometer magnet few meters away .",
    "the pmts are read out by frontend electronics mounted directly on the detector , which consists of the mad4 preamplifier and discriminator and the f1 tdc chip .",
    "the mad4 chip @xcite has a low noise level of @xmath32  fc compared to the average pmt signal of about @xmath33  fc . it is able to handle signals up to @xmath31  mhz rate . in @xmath34 ,",
    "the mad4 will be replaced by c - mad chips , which have a rate capability up to @xmath35  mhz .",
    "the digital part of the read - out consists of the dead - time free f1 tdc @xcite mounted on the dreisam frontend card .",
    "it has a time resolution of better than @xmath5  ps and can handle input rates up to @xmath36  mhz at trigger rates of up to @xmath2  khz .",
    "the data from one frontend card with @xmath37 read - out channels are transferred via optical links to the compass read - out system @xcite .",
    "all read - out electronics is mounted in a very compact setup directly on the detector .",
    "ns around the physics trigger .",
    "one can see cherenkov rings of several hadrons.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    ns.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     +",
    "in the compass beam - time 2006 , all data have been taken with the upgraded rich detector ( see figs .",
    "[ rings ] , [ timing ] and [ masspeak ] ) .",
    "the detector shows excellent performance : the number of photons per ring has increased from @xmath6 before the upgrade to above @xmath7 at saturation ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the increased statistics in the number of photons has improved the ring resolution to @xmath23  mrad from @xmath22  mrad before .",
    "while the increased number of photons has improved the particle identification capability at lower momenta , the better ring resolution extends the particle identification towards higher momenta . the time resolution for single photons ( see fig . [ timing ] ) is about @xmath31  ns , which allows an almost complete rejection of the background from uncorrelated halo muon cherenkov signals .",
    "a fast photon detection system with multi - anode photomultipliers and fast read - out electronics based on the mad4 discriminator and the f1 tdc has been designed and constructed to upgrade the ring imaging cerenkov ( rich ) detector of the compass experiment .",
    "the upgraded detector was ready for the beam - time in 2006 and first data show an excellent performance of the new photon detection system .",
    "the time resolution of about @xmath31  ns allows an almost complete rejection of the background cherenkov photons from uncorrelated muon halo events , which improves efficiency and purity ( see fig .",
    "[ masspeak ] ) of the particle identification especially in the very forward direction .",
