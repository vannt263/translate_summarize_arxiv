    "superconductors , whose averaged order parameter over the entire fermi surface yields zero , are called unconventional . they attract much interest @xcite in modern condensed matter physics because a description of the underlying physics has to go beyond the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory for an @xmath3-wave order parameter .",

    "however , these predictions take only certain quasiparticle contributions into account : for an @xmath3-wave superconductor it is the contribution to the density of states from the states within the vortex cores ; for nodal superconductors it is a contribution from the delocalized quasiparticles around the nodes .",
    "deviations are , therefore , expected , if one takes further contributions into account .",
    "in addition to core states and delocalized quasiparticles , respectively , this would be vortex lattice contributions @xcite .",
    "since the temperature dependence of the specific heat does not indicate the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap function , we will focus here on the case of fully gaped superconductors .",
    "a deviation of @xmath97 from the predicted linear dependence was observed in several @xmath3-wave superconductors @xcite .",

    "e.g. _  in the case of nbse@xmath98 @xcite .",
    "let us now compare our thermal conductivity results with observations and predictions for the case of nodes in the superconducting gap .",
    "there are both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite reports on a minimum in @xmath164 for unconventional superconductors .",
    "the slope above the minimum can vary considerably depending on the type of gap and the purity of the sample @xcite ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa - vs - h](b ) ) .",
    "such a minimum is consistent with our observation .",
    "hence , this property does not rule out nodes in the gap of lapt@xmath0ge@xmath1  completely .",
    "however , one would expect a sizable residual term for @xmath145 in a nodal superconductor .",
    "in contrast , both single - band and multiband @xmath3-wave superconductors show an insignificantly small residual term exactly as our results on lapt@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "we performed specific - heat and thermal - conductivity measurements to investigate the superconducting order parameter of lapt@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "the specific heat shows a sharp superconducting transition at 8.0k and its zero - field temperature - dependence in the superconducting state can nicely be described assuming a single bcs @xmath3-wave gap of the size @xmath177 .",
    "the field dependence of the @xmath19-coefficient deviates from the simple linear behavior for @xmath3-wave pairing . such a deviation can arise , if the fermi surface shows strong anisotropies as is the case for lapt@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "we used the specific - heat results to analyze the low - temperature thermal - transport in detail .",
    "the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity reveals a dominant phonon contribution at low temperatures and a negligible electronic residual term .",
    "together with the dependence of the thermal conductivity on magnetic field , this behavior suggests a single gap bcs @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "however , we can not completely exclude a two - band scenario from our experimental results , in particular if both gaps have a similar size @xmath178 or if one of them has only a tiny contribution to the thermal - transport and thermodynamic properties .",
    "the analysis of the specific heat data enables us to limit the possible range of amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 and weighting factors @xmath35 within the two - gap @xmath34-model .",
    "the possible parameter range is comparatively large , since a single - band model is already sufficient to describe our experimental results .",
    "since the sister compound prpt@xmath6ge@xmath1  is discussed to be a multigap and/or unconventional superconductor , further thermal conductivity and specific heat measurements on the substitution series ( pr@xmath4la@xmath17)pt@xmath0ge@xmath1 are highly desired .",
    "they might help to resolve the question , if prpt@xmath6ge@xmath1  and lapt@xmath0ge@xmath1  have compatible superconducting order parameters as was suggested by the smooth evolution of @xmath179 across the substitution series .",
    "we are indebted to r.  daou and h.  rosner for valuable discussions ."
