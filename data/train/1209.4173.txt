    "let @xmath4 be a one - dimensional it semimartingale , which in particular means that its `` continuous martingale part '' has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a standard brownian motion , and the process @xmath7 is optional and ( locally ) squared integrable .",
    "one of the long - standing problems is the estimation of the so - called integrated volatility , say at time @xmath8 , that is of the variable @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ( squared ) volatility , on the basis of discrete observations of @xmath4 .",
    "a huge number of papers have been devoted to this question already , in various situations : when the process is continuous ( so @xmath4 is the sum of @xmath11 above , plus possibly a drift term ) , or when it has jumps ; when the process @xmath4 is `` perfectly '' observed , or contaminated by noise ; when the sampling times are equi - spaced , or when they are irregularly spaced .",
    "below , we focus on the basic case , where the sampling is at regularly spaced times @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and when @xmath14 is observed without noise . even in this simple situation , the question of the `` optimal '' rate of convergence of estimators toward @xmath15 , as @xmath16 , is unanswered so far , when there are jumps which are `` too active . ''",
    "more precisely , estimators are known , which converge to @xmath15 with the rate @xmath17 , in the continuous case ( the realized volatility , or `` approximate quadratic variation '' at time @xmath8 , achieves this rate ) , and also when @xmath4 has jumps with a degree of activity , or blumenthal  getoor index , less than @xmath8 .",
    "this rate is optimal ( in a minimax sense ) , for the following reason : if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant , so @xmath20 , we have a purely parametric setting for which the local asymptotic normality ( lan ) holds with rate @xmath17 , and the realized volatility is indeed the mle in this case .",
    "however , when the degree @xmath0 of jump activity is larger than @xmath8 , the best rates found in the literature are of the form @xmath21 for @xmath22 arbitrarily small ( see below for more details ) .",
    "the difficulty comes of course from the essentially nonparametric feature of the problem , since we do not want to specify the law of the process @xmath4 , apart from the fact that it is an it semimartingale , plus possibly some boundedness assumptions on its characteristics . in a purely parametric problem , for example , when @xmath4 is a lvy process with a _ known _ lvy measure and the only unknown parameters are the variance @xmath23 of the gaussian part , and possibly the drift , then again the rate @xmath17 is available for estimating @xmath23 ( this rate is achieved by the mle , under very general circumstances ) .",
    "there has been a considerable interest in providing also nonparametric estimators that converge at rate @xmath17 , but as we show here , this is in general impossible .    in this paper ,",
    "a bound for the minimax rate is determined , when the degree of activity is @xmath0 or smaller [ the precise definition of @xmath0 is given in assumption  [ asslr ] below , and is slightly different from the usual blumenthal ",
    "getoor index ] .",
    "we will see that the best possible rate is @xmath24 when @xmath25 ( and of course @xmath17 when @xmath26 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the truncated realized volatility , which achieves the rate @xmath21 for any prespecified @xmath22 is indeed `` almost '' rate - optimal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - k ] , we state the assumptions and review some known results .",
    "the results of this paper are presented in section  [ sec - r ] , and the proofs are given in the last section .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional it semimartingale @xmath4 on a filtered space @xmath27 , which is observed at regularly spaced times @xmath28 for @xmath29 , over the ( fixed ) finite interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the characteristics @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the drift , @xmath33 the integrated volatility and @xmath34 the lvy system of  @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , chapter  1 of @xcite ) , thus have the form @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are optional ( or , predictable ) processes , with @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is an optional random measure , also called the lvy measure , which accounts for the jumps of the process .",
    "when @xmath4 is continuous , the canonical way for estimating @xmath15 is to use the realized volatility , or approximate quadratic variation at time @xmath8 : @xmath40^n_1=\\sum _ { i=1}^n\\bigl(\\delta^n_ix \\bigr)^2\\qquad\\mbox{where } \\delta^n_ix = x_{i / n}-x_{(i-1)/n},\\ ] ] which converges in probability to @xmath15 . when further @xmath41 and @xmath42 are a.s .",
    "finite , we have the stable convergence in law at rate @xmath17 @xmath43^n_1-c_1 \\bigr ) { \\stackrel{\\mathcal{l}-\\mathrm{s}}{\\longrightarrow}}\\mathcal{u}\\qquad\\mbox{where } \\mathcal{u}=\\sqrt{2}\\int _ 0 ^ 1c_s \\,dw'_s,\\ ] ] and where @xmath44 is a standard brownian motion , defined on an extension of @xmath27 , and which is independent of the @xmath45-field @xmath46 : see , for example , theorem 5.4.2 in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 has jumps , the variables @xmath47^n_1 $ ] no longer converge to @xmath15 , but to the `` full '' quadratic variation @xmath47_1= c_1+\\sum_{s\\leq1}(\\delta x_s)^2 $ ] , where @xmath48 denotes the jump size at time @xmath49 .",
    "however , there are two known methods to consistently estimate @xmath15 :    _ truncated realized volatility_. one chooses a sequence @xmath50 of positive truncation levels , typically of the form @xmath51 for some @xmath52 , and considers @xmath53    _ multipower variations_. one chooses an integer @xmath54 , and considers @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57th absolute moment of a standard normal variable @xmath58 ( other versions are possible ; one may , e.g. , take any product of @xmath59 increments , with powers adding up to @xmath60 ) .",
    "the first method has been introduced by mancini in @xcite , the second one by barndorff - nielsen and shephard in @xcite .",
    "both provide estimators which converge in probability to @xmath15 , upon rather weak assumptions on the jumps .    the question of the rate of convergence , though , is still open , and we quickly review the known results , in the case of truncated realized volatility .",
    "one needs the following assumption , where @xmath0 is a number in @xmath61 $ ] :    [ asslr ] the variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 and@xmath64 are almost surely finite .",
    "the larger @xmath0 is , the weaker assumption [ asslr ] is .",
    "( l-2 ) is a very weak assumption for an it semimartingale , whereas [ asslr ] when @xmath65 puts restrictions on the jump activity , and is slightly stronger than saying that the blumenthal  getoor index of @xmath4 ( or , jump activity index ) is not bigger than @xmath0 . in particular , ( l-@xmath8 )",
    "is slightly stronger than the property of the jumps to be summable on each finite interval , for example , the jump part to have trajectories of finite variation .",
    "note that a stable process of index @xmath66 satisfies [ asslr ] for all @xmath67 , but not for @xmath68 .",
    "when [ asslr ] holds for some @xmath69 , the estimators @xmath70 enjoy exactly the same clt as in ( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath71 in place of @xmath47_t$ ] , with the same limit , provided we have @xmath72 when [ asslr ] holds for some @xmath73 , the clt with rate @xmath17 no longer holds for @xmath71 , but we have when @xmath74 with @xmath75 : @xmath76 ( convergence in probability ) .",
    "these results are shown in  @xcite , and mancini in  @xcite has proved that when the jumps of @xmath4 are those of a stable process with index @xmath77 [ so holds for all @xmath67 , but not for @xmath78 , and when @xmath79 , the estimator converges exactly at rate @xmath80 , in the sense that the sequence @xmath81 converges to a nontrivial limit ( in probability , and not in law , in this case ) : this rate is less than @xmath17 , as it is in ( [ 7 ] ) , and no proper clt is available in this case .",
    "turning now to multipowers , we have analogous results , except that one needs stronger assumptions : basically , [ asslr ] plus the fact that the process @xmath37 is also an it semimartingale , and never vanishes : the clt for @xmath82 holds when @xmath69 , with @xmath83 replaced by a suitable ( bigger ) constant depending on @xmath59 ; see @xcite .",
    "when @xmath84 , vetter in @xcite proves that there is a clt at rate @xmath17 with a nonvanishing bias term . when @xmath25 nothing is formally known , but the presence of the bias term when @xmath84 suggests that for @xmath25 the rate is less than @xmath17",
    "we are in a nonparametric setting , in which the process @xmath4 is not specified [ apart from the fact that it satisfies [ asslr ] for some @xmath0 ] , and even the space @xmath86 is not specified .",
    "the meaning of `` optimality '' or `` rate - optimality '' is not a priori clear ; and , to begin with , even the quantity to estimate , namely @xmath15 , depends of course on the space @xmath86 and on @xmath4 .    a possible setting is as follows .",
    "we consider a family @xmath87 of it semimartingales satisfying [ asslr ] , each one being defined on its own filtered space @xmath86 , and the quantity to estimate is the associated integrated volatility @xmath88 .",
    "each @xmath4 in @xmath87 takes its values , as a process , in the skorokhod space  @xmath89 of all cdlg functions on @xmath90 , and the image by @xmath4 of the observed @xmath45-field @xmath91 is the @xmath45-field @xmath92 of @xmath89 . for any @xmath93",
    "we denote by @xmath94 the restriction to @xmath95 of the law of @xmath4 .",
    "an estimator at stage @xmath3 is a @xmath95-measurable function @xmath96 on @xmath89 .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath97 of such estimators achieves the uniform rate @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 ) on @xmath87 , for estimating @xmath15 , if the family @xmath100 is tight , uniformly in @xmath3 and in @xmath101 , that is , @xmath102 uniformly in @xmath93 .    of course",
    ", if @xmath103 denotes the set of _ all _ it semimartingales satisfying [ asslr ] , there can not be any uniform rate because , to begin with , the variables @xmath88 are not uniformly tight when @xmath4 runs through @xmath103 : we need to restrict our attention to subfamilies of @xmath103 which are `` bounded '' in some sense . in view of the formulation of  [ asslr ] ,",
    "it is natural to consider , for any @xmath104 , the class @xmath105\\\\[-10pt ] & & \\mbox{$|b_t|+c_t+\\int(|x|^r\\wedge1 ) f_t(dx ) \\leq   a \\mbox { for all $ t$}$}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also denote by @xmath106 the subclass of all lvy processes belonging to @xmath107 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ tr-1 ] let @xmath1 and @xmath104 .",
    "any uniform rate @xmath98 for estimating @xmath88 , within the class @xmath106 , hence also within the bigger class @xmath107 , satisfies ( up to a multiplicative constant , of course ) @xmath108    the results recalled in the previous section show that the truncated estimators @xmath70 ( which are estimators in the sense specified above ) achieve the rate @xmath109 when @xmath69 , and at least @xmath110 when @xmath73 , for any @xmath4 satisfying [ asslr ] .",
    "we indeed have ( slightly ) more :    [ tr-2 ] let @xmath1 and @xmath104 , and take @xmath74 .",
    "the truncated estimators @xmath70 have the uniform rate @xmath98 below , within @xmath107 , for estimating  @xmath88 , @xmath111    when @xmath69 , the truncated estimators @xmath70 achieve the uniform rate @xmath17 , and as seen in the previous section they even enjoy a clt . when @xmath73 we have the uniform rate @xmath110 , although for any given @xmath4 we indeed have a `` faster '' rate , as seen in ( [ 7 ] ) ; however , this faster rate is not uniform in @xmath112 , as could be seen by taking a sequence of lvy processes with characteristics @xmath113 , with @xmath114 ( so @xmath115 for all @xmath3 ) , but such that @xmath116 does _ not _ tend to @xmath117 as @xmath118 .",
    "we then conclude that the truncated estimators are uniformly rate optimal when @xmath69 , and otherwise they approach the bound @xmath109 , up to @xmath119 with @xmath22 arbitrarily small , upon choosing @xmath120 close enough to @xmath121 .",
    "let us finally show that on the restricted class @xmath106 of lvy processes the rate @xmath109 of ( [ r-2 ] ) can be achieved exactly and thus constitutes the exact minimax optimal rate : this means that for any @xmath1 and any @xmath104 one can find estimators for @xmath88 enjoying the uniform rate @xmath109 . when @xmath69 , we already know this ( even for the much larger class @xmath107 ) by the previous theorem , but for all @xmath1 we can construct estimators with the uniform rate @xmath109 on @xmath122 as follows . for any process  @xmath4 , we consider the empirical characteristic function of the increments , at each stage @xmath3 ( below @xmath123 ) : @xmath124 then we set @xmath125    [ tr-3 ] for all @xmath104 and @xmath1 , the estimators @xmath126 with @xmath127 attain the uniform rate @xmath109 for estimating @xmath88 , within the class @xmath128 of lvy processes .",
    "[ r1 ] when @xmath26 the estimators @xmath126 are likely to enjoy a central limit theorem with rate @xmath109 , and with a bias when @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath25 , and upon examining the proof [ see ( [ c-13 ] ) and ( [ c-15 ] ) , e.g. ] , the estimation error @xmath129 is the sum of a random part , which is easily seen to enjoy a clt with rate @xmath130 , and a nonrandom part equal to @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the lvy measure of the lvy process @xmath4 under consideration .",
    "it turns out that @xmath133 tends to @xmath117 by lebesgue s theorem , so , for any given @xmath4 we indeed have in probability : this convergence is of course not uniform in @xmath134 , otherwise the conclusion of theorem [ tr-1 ] would be violated .",
    "now , depending on whether @xmath135 converges or diverges  and both occurrences are possible  we have a clt with rate @xmath136 , or we have a slower effective rate ( still at least  @xmath109 , of course ) with the normalized error converging in probability to a nontrivial limit .",
    "note that the argumentation is in line with the standard nonparametric error decomposition in a bias and variance part .",
    "our estimator uses that the characteristic exponent for high frequencies @xmath137 separates the brownian from the jump part according to the ratio @xmath138 .",
    "we have reliable empirical access to this exponent only up to frequency @xmath137 ( otherwise the stochastic error explodes due to a gaussian deconvolution setting ) .",
    "so far , we do not know whether this spectral approach yields the same optimal rate on the larger class @xmath107 .",
    "_ the bound _ @xmath139 . for proving this bound ,",
    "it is enough to show that it already holds on the subclass @xmath140 of all brownian motions with unit variance @xmath141 ( so @xmath142 for all @xmath143 $ ] ) .    in this case , and as already mentioned in the , the increments follow the parametric model @xmath144 with parameter @xmath23 running through @xmath145 $ ] , for which the lan property holds with rate @xmath17 , and the result follows .    _",

    "hence , in order to find a bound on the uniform rate @xmath98 on @xmath122 , hence a fortiori on @xmath107 , it is enough to construct two sequences @xmath148 and @xmath149 of lvy processes belonging to @xmath150 for @xmath151 and some constant @xmath152 , with the following two properties , where @xmath153 : @xmath154    indeed , letting @xmath155 be a sequence of estimators with uniform rate on @xmath107 ( or , even , on @xmath156 ) , the two sequences @xmath157 and @xmath158 are tight under @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively , by ( [ p-1 ] ) .",
    "then ( [ p-2 ] ) implies that the sequence @xmath161 is also tight under @xmath160 .",
    "this is possible only if the sequence @xmath162 is bounded .",
    "so @xmath163 is an upper bound for any uniform rate on @xmath164 ( up to a multiplicative constant , of course ) .",
    "we take lvy processes @xmath148 and @xmath149 with respective characteristics @xmath165 and @xmath113 , with lvy measures @xmath166 satisfying @xmath167 for some constant @xmath152 ( below constants change from line to line , and may depend on @xmath0 , and are all denoted as @xmath152 ) .    by construction , we have ( [ p-1 ] ) and @xmath168 for a constant @xmath152 [ which may differ from the one in ( [ c-1 ] ) ] , and we need to choose the above measures @xmath169 and @xmath170 in such a way that ( [ p-2 ] ) is satisfied .",

    "<S> the optimal rate of convergence of estimators of the integrated volatility , for a discontinuous it semimartingale sampled at regularly spaced times and over a fixed time interval , has been a long - standing problem , at least when the jumps are not summable . in this paper , we study this optimal rate , in the minimax sense and for appropriate `` bounded '' nonparametric classes of semimartingales . we show that , if the @xmath0th powers of the jumps are summable for some @xmath1 , the minimax rate is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of observations . </S>"
