    "most of the work in non - perturbative quantum gravity is restricted to the unphysical euclidean sector , deferring the construction of the physical lorentzian theory .",
    "a step towards the lorentzian theory has been recently taken in refs.@xcite , with the definition of spinfoam models based on @xmath1 representation theory .",
    "however , these models includes only ( simple ) representations in the continuous series , and not the ones in the discrete series . since the signature of the surfaces in the spinfoam is determined by the sign of the casimir , which is opposite in the two series , all surfaces of the model turn out to have the same signature . in a more realistic model , on the other hand , we expect spacelike as well as timelike surfaces to appear , and thus all ( simple ) representation to contribute . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new model , which includes both kinds of representations . as a consequence",
    ", the model incorporates a combinatorial non - perturbative notion of local causality associated to quantum spacetime .",
    "surfaces in a given spinfoam can be classified as timelike or spacelike , according to the kind of simple representations by which they are colored .",
    "we recall that spinfoam models provide a framework for background independent diffeomorphism - invariant quantum field theory and quantum gravity in particular @xcite .",
    "they provide a rigorous implementation of the wheeler - misner - hawking@xcite sum over geometries formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "the 4-geometries summed over are represented by spinfoams .",
    "these are defined as colored 2-complexes .",
    "a 2-complex @xmath2 is a ( combinatorial ) set of elements called `` vertices '' @xmath3 , `` edges '' @xmath4 and `` faces '' @xmath5 , and a boundary relation among these .",
    "a spinfoam is a 2-complex plus a `` coloring '' @xmath6 , that is an assignment of an irreducible representation @xmath7 of a given group @xmath8 to each face @xmath5 and of an intertwiner @xmath9 to each edge @xmath4 .",
    "the model is defined by the partition function @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to the amplitude associated to faces , edges , and vertices respectively ( they are given functions of the corresponding colors ) .",
    "@xmath14 is a normalization factor for each 2-complex .",
    "spinfoam models can be obtained as the perturbative expansion of a field theory over a group manifold@xcite . in this language",
    ", spinfoams appear as feynman diagrams of a scalar field theory over a group .",
    "more precisely equation ( [ z ] ) can be obtained by the perturbative expansion of @xmath15}\\ ] ] in momentum space . in particular , the topological models of bf theory can be described in this framework @xcite .",
    "the field theory approach has several advantages .",
    "it implements automatically the sum over 2-complexes @xmath2 , and in particular , fixes the @xmath14 value in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "this sum restores full general covariance of a theory with local degrees of freedom such as general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "other advantages of the field theory formulation are related to the possibility of performing formal manipulations directly on configuration space of the field theory , which turn out to be much simpler than working directly with the state sum model of equation ( [ z ] ) ( i.e. , momentum space ) .",
    "examples of this are the proof of topological invariance for the bf models due to ooguri@xcite , and the definition of the lorentzian model mentioned above . in this last case ,",
    "the non - compactness of @xmath1 introduces additional complications that are easier to deal with in the field theory formulation .",
    "spinfoam models related to gravity have been obtained as modifications of topological quantum field theories by implementing the constraint that reduce bf theory to gr @xcite .",
    "essentially this constraint amounts to restrict to simple representations only .",
    "the resulting models correspond to a diffeomorpism invariant lattice - like quantization of plebanski s formulation of gr @xcite . in the field theory framework , the constraints reducing bf theory to gr are naturally implemented by imposing a symmetry requirement on the field action defining the bf model @xcite . in the euclidean models , the field is defined over @xmath16 , and the bf to gr constraint is imposed as a symmetry under an @xmath17 subgroup .",
    "amplitudes turn out to be expressed as integrals over the homogeneous space @xmath18 and the theory is controlled by the harmonic analysis on @xmath19 , which contains the simple representations of @xmath16 . in the lorentzian models introduced in refs.@xcite , the field is defined over @xmath1 , and the bf to gr constraint is imposed as a symmetry under an @xmath20 subgroup .",
    "amplitudes turn out to be expressed as integrals over the homogeneous space @xmath21 , which is the ( real ) lobachevskian space : the upper hyperboloid of unit norm timelike vectors in in minkowski space .",
    "the theory is controlled by the harmonic analysis on this space , which contains the continuous simple representations of @xmath1 only .",
    "in the model we introduce here , the field is still defined over @xmath1 , but the bf to gr constraint is imposed as a symmetry under an @xmath22 subgroup .",
    "amplitudes turn out to be expressed as integrals over the homogeneous space @xmath23 , which is the _ imaginary _ lobachevskian space : the hyperboloid of unit norm spacelike vectors in in minkowski space , with opposite points identified .",
    "the theory is controlled by the harmonic analysis on this space , which contains simple representations of @xmath1 in the continuous as well as in the discrete series .",
    "thus , we obtain a model that implements the bf to gr constraints and in which the quantum four geometries summed over have spacelike as well as timelike surfaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the general setting in which the lorentzian spinfoam model of reference @xcite was defined .",
    "the new model is defined in the same framework in terms of a simple modification of the one in @xcite .",
    "both variants are presented in the corresponding subsections .",
    "we obtain the edge and vertex amplitudes of the models as integrals over the lobachevskian spaces of a kernel @xmath24 . in section [ app2 ]",
    "we compute these kernels for the two models . in the appendix we present a compendium of known results on harmonic analysis and representation theory of @xmath1 on which our construction is based .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the general framework of spinfoam models defined as a field theory over a group .",
    "in particular we review the derivation of the lorentzian spinfoam model of @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the simplicity constraints is encoded the symmetries of the interaction .",
    "those symmetries are implemented in the field action by means of group averaging techniques .",
    "the new model differs from its previous relative in the kind of symmetries required ( different implementation of the constraints ) .",
    "for that reason we start the section with the simultaneous treatment of both theories since the formal manipulation necessary to derive the model are the same in each one of them . in the two subsection that follow this general derivation we explicitly state the results for both models .",
