    "it was shown by ng  @xcite that any wright - convex function is a  sum of the convex function ( in the usual sense ) and the additive one .",
    "such representation leads to the simple ( and now classical ) proof that the inclusion in question is proper .",
    "namely , if @xmath14 is a  discontinuous additive function and @xmath15 , then @xmath16  is discontinuous and jensen - convex .",
    "hence the graph of  @xmath16 is not dense on the whole plane .",
    "but it is well - known (  @xcite ) that the graphs of discontinuous additive functions ( and also  by ng s representation  the graphs of discontinuous wright - convex functions ) mapping  @xmath17 into  @xmath17 are dense on the whole plane .",
    "that is why  @xmath16 is not wright - convex .",
    "recently nikodem , rajba and wsowicz in the paper  @xcite considered the related comparison problem for the classes of @xmath0-wright - convex functions and @xmath0-jensen - convex functions ( the explanation is given below in this section ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is odd , they have shown that the first class is the proper subclass of the latter one .",
    "the example of @xmath0-jensen - convex function which is not @xmath0-wright - convex was @xmath19  @xmath20 , where @xmath14 is the certain discontinuous additive function .",
    "next ples  @xcite proved that this example works for any discontinuous additive function .",
    "the authors of  @xcite did not solve the problem , if  @xmath0 is even .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to give the complete solution by showing that the inclusion is proper for all @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the construction of our example does not depend on the parity of  @xmath0 .",
    "then for odd  @xmath0 we have a  solution different from the ones given in the papers  @xcite .",
    "let us recall the concepts of higher - order jensen - convex ( coming from popoviciu  @xcite ) and wright - convex functions ( introduced by gilnyi and ples  @xcite ) .",
    "the iterates of  difference operator are we defined as usual : for @xmath18 @xmath21 provided that all the involved arguments belong to  @xmath10 . if @xmath22 , then we write @xmath23 in particular , @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath2 be a  function .",
    "we say that @xmath16 is _ wright - convex of order  @xmath0 _ ( or @xmath0-_wright - convex _ for short ) , if @xmath25 for any @xmath4 and @xmath26  @xmath27 . if the above inequality is required only for @xmath28 , precisely , if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath9 such that @xmath31 , then  @xmath16 is called _ jensen - convex of order  @xmath0 _ ( @xmath0-_jensen - convex _ for short ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath32-wright - convexity and @xmath32-jensen - convexity are equivalent to wright - convexity and jensen - convexity , respectively .    by the above definitions any @xmath0-wright - convex function is necessarily @xmath0-jensen - convex . as we announced above , in this paper we show that this inclusion is proper .",

    "now we are in a position to state our main result .",
    "[ th_main ] for any @xmath18 the class of @xmath0-wright - convex functions is a  proper subclass of the class of @xmath0-jensen - convex functions .    because every @xmath0-wright - convex function is @xmath0-jensen - convex",
    ", it is enough to construct an  @xmath0-jensen - convex function @xmath19 which is not @xmath0-wright convex . to this end",
    "consider a  hamel basis @xmath38 of the linear space @xmath17 over  @xmath39  @xmath40 .",
