    "in models of supergravity ( sugra )  @xcite , superweakly interacting massive fields are generally involved , such as the gravitino and modulus fields .",

    "hence , their abundances are severely restricted . among the sugra particles , gravitinos are thermally produced in hot plasma .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out that a large amount of gravitinos are generated via decays of coherent oscillations of heavy scalars , such as moduli and inflatons  @xcite .",

    "the two sectors communicate with each other , and gravitino production occurs .    in eq .  , it is sufficient to evaluate @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the zeroth order , because @xmath53 and @xmath54 start from the first order of the perturbation",

    "there are no bounds in the case of @xmath198gev in this parameter space .",

    "@xcite , where the bounds are given by @xmath204 and @xmath205 for the gravitino masses of @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "thus , from eqs .   and , the allowed region of the reheating temperature is @xmath208 where the upper bound comes from the thermal gravitino abundance , while the lower bound is from direct production .",
    "this is because the thermal abundance is proportional to @xmath209 , while the abundance from the latter is to @xmath210 .",
    "it is noticed that the window tends to close as the energy scale of the scalar model is higher . in order to avoid the cosmological bound",

    "the susy - breaking sector is generalized , and the sources of the gravitational corrections are clarified . in this section , the previous result will be reproduced .",
    "moreover , the contribution which was overlooked will be pointed out .",
    "it is assumed here that the susy - breaking sector is composed of a single chiral supermultiplet , @xmath222 , and there is no extra gauge symmetry for the sake of comparison with the result in ref .",

    "in contrast to d - term susy breaking , the susy - invariant mass of @xmath222 is at most comparable to the gravitino mass , @xmath223 , which was neglected in ref .",

    "next , the vevs of @xmath255 and @xmath128 can be represented in terms of those of the other fields , since the potential is quadratic with respect to @xmath255 and @xmath128 . substituting them into the potential , it involves four real variables , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , and @xmath259 .",
