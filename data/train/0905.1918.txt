    "pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars are surrounded by very powerful magnetospheres that extend 2 - 4 stellar radii to the limits of the inner disk boundary .",
    "the magnetospheres are powered by the stellar magnetic field , the accreting infalling material and the shearing at the boundary between the magnetosphere and the inner disk ( see gmez de castro 2009 for a recent review ) .",
    "magnetospheric heating processes during pre - main sequence evolution are poorly studied , as well as the relative relevance of the contributions mentioned above .",
    "this is partially caused by the similar densities ( 10@xmath5 @xmath4 ) and temperatures ( 10@xmath6k ) of several distinct physical components in the circumstellar environment ( the disk - star shear layer , the outflow and the accretion flow ) .",
    "moreover , the high temperature of the plasma makes thermal broadening very large ( @xmath7 km  s@xmath2 ) leaving ultraviolet high spectral resolution monitoring as the only technique to resolve the various contributions since variability time scales are expected to be very different for the various components ( see i.e. gmez de castro & verdugo 2007 ) .",
    "close pre - main sequence binaries are ideal targets to unveil some of the magnetospheric properties .",
    "circumstellar accretion disks are difficult to accommodate in these systems since the strong gravitational tides break them into rings .",
    "the inner boundary of the circumbinary disk is pushed outwards by the binary orbit thus the magnetosphere of each individual star is not locked to the disk rather , it is expected that a strong coupling between the gravitational tides and the stellar magnetic fields ought to be a major source of atmospheric / magnetospheric heating .",
    "the investigation of the atmospheric properties of close pre - main sequence stars provides important clues regarding the possible role of magnetospheric dynamos in pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "ak sco is a unique target for this purpose ; it is the only pre - main sequence binary known to date with small eccentricity and composed of two nearly equal stars that get as close as 11  r@xmath8 at periastron passage .",
    "no signs of enhanced accretion have been detected at periastron ( andersen et al . 1989 , alencar et al .",
    "polarimetric observations have reported the largest variations of percent polarization and position angle detected in a pre - main sequence binary ( manset et al . 2005 ) .",
    "variations are found to be periodical with period equal to the gravitational tide period ( half the orbital period ) .",
    "the main parameters of the binary are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] . in this letter , the profiles of the ( semiforbidden ) intercombination lines of the optically thin magnetospheric tracers : the ciii ] at 1908  and the si iii ] at 1892  spectral lines , are analyzed . from the analysis , it is concluded that there is an extended region of radius @xmath9r@xmath8 around each star containing hot ( @xmath10 ) and highly perturbed gas that produces a gaussian - like profile broadening with @xmath11  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "although this broadening is highly suprathermal it could be sufalvnic if ak  sco s magnetic field is similar or higher than that reported for other pre - main sequence stars ( see i.e. johns - krull , 2007 ) .",
    "ak  sco was observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on march 10 , 2001 .",
    "the observations were carried out with grating g230 m to target the semiforbidden lines of si  iii ] at 1892  and c  iii ] at 1908 .",
    "the spectra were obtained at phase 0.2814 according to andersen et al ( 1989 ) ephemeris ( see table  1 ) . at this phase ,",
    "the radial velocity of both components is the same thus the profiles represent the co - added contribution of both components in the same velocity space .",
    "as all indications are that the two components are equal in all respects , including spectral type , the contribution from both stars is expected to be the same .    ak  sco displays strong and very broad si  iii ] and c  iii ] profiles .",
    "the observed line profiles have been converted to velocity distribution using the doppler shift formula .",
    "data have been processed with the routine science data pipeline ( rsdp ) .",
    "the major source of inaccuracy in the calibration is the centering of the target in the aperture that can account for as much as 2.8  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the exposure duration was 1944  s that were splitted into three subexposures ; the average value for each pixel and the deviation from this average are plotted in fig .  1",
    ". a curve fit to a single gaussian plus a constant is also shown .",
    "the dispersion of the gaussians are @xmath12(c  iii])=109.5  km / s and @xmath12(si  iii])=106.8  km / s .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is 3.6 and 1.3 for this best gaussian fit to the si  iii ] and c  iii ] lines , respectively .",
    "the instrumental profile of hst / stis with the grating g230 m has a fwhm of 30  km / s and the stellar rotation velocity is @xmath14  km  s@xmath2 , thus line broadening)=251  km / s and fwhm(c  iii])=258  km / s . ] is more than one order of magnitude larger than expected from the rotational broadening of the atmospheric lines .",
    "the lines fluxes are : f(si  iii ] ) = @xmath15erg / s/@xmath16 and f(c  iii ] ) = @xmath17erg / s/@xmath16 , after correction for extinction using valencic et al .",
    "2004 uv law ( r= a@xmath18/e@xmath19=4.3 from manset et al . 2005 and",
    "a@xmath20 mag from alencar et al .",
    "the lines ratio is calculated to be f(si  iii])/f(c  iii ] ) = @xmath21 .",
    "this value is similar to that derived from earlier ( 1982 and 1988 ) low resolution observations obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) ( gmez de castro & franqueira 1997 ) . from the iue low dispersion spectra a c  iv(@xmath22 flux of @xmath23erg / s/@xmath16 and a ratio f(c  iv)/f(si  iii ] ) of @xmath24",
    "was derived .",
    "there are only three low resolution observations carried out with the iue , two of them during the same cycle at periastron ( phase=0.123 ) and at apastron ( phase=0.708 ) .",
    "no significant variations in the c  iii ] , si  iii ] and c  iv fluxes in the o  i ( @xmath25 ) and c  ii resonance multiplet at 1335 ; these lines trace cooler and lower density plasma . ]",
    "are found though the iue fluxes are about a factor of @xmath26 higher than that measured with the hst .",
    "assuming collisional equilibrium , the f(si  iii])/f(c  iii ] ) and f(c  iv)/f(si  iii ] ) ratios indicate that the physical conditions in this hot line emission region ( hler ) are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "an optically thin collisional plasma with these properties radiates @xmath29 of the total flux in the c  iii ] line ; thus the luminosity of the hler is 3.1@xmath30erg / s or 0.08@xmath31 ( 0.04@xmath31 per star assuming the same contribution per component ) ; a distance , @xmath32 , of 145  pc to ak  sco has been assumed . to account for this high luminosity",
    "an accretion rate  au ( three times the semimajor axis of the orbit ) is estimated for the gap of the circumbinary accretion disk based on numerical simulations of the evolution of binary systems ( artymovicz & lubow , 1997 ) .",
    "] of @xmath33 m@xmath34yr@xmath2 is required .",
    "the viscous release of this gravitational energy in the circumbinary disk would affect significantly the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) however , good fits are obtained with passive disk models suggesting that the accretion rate is not very much above @xmath35  m@xmath34yr@xmath2 ( see i.e. alencar et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion on the sed fit ) .    the characteristic size of the hler , @xmath36 , is given by , @xmath37 = \\frac { 3 f_l d^2 } { < j_l >",
    "r_*^3 } =    0.4\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the radius of an equivalent homogeneous spherical envelope around each star , with @xmath38 representing the average emissivity in the ( si  iii ] ) lines formation region , which for this study , has been assumed to be of the order of @xmath39erg  s@xmath2  @xmath4 using the atomic parameters from the chianti atomic data base ) .",
    "here @xmath40 represents the volume filling factor of the radiating plasma . for @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath36 reaches 1.7  r@xmath8 .",
    "this is an indication of the hler being significantly more extended than the atmosphere of a cool main sequence star .",
    "line broadening is highly suprathermal ( thermal broadening at @xmath42k generates a fwhm of 73  km / s , a factor of @xmath43 smaller than the observed ) . in principle , such a broad kinetic velocity distribution of the emitting ions could be produced , as in the sun , by resonances between alfvn waves propagating in the atmosphere and the giro - frequency of the ions , driving the si  iii ] and c  iii ] ions to the very high kinetic temperature of @xmath44k ( see i.e. cranmer 2002 ) .",
    "however , the strength of this broad component must correlate with the coronal x - ray surface flux produced by the bremsstrahlung radiation of the high velocity electrons , as shown for magnetically active stars by wood et al .",
    "1997 . though ak  sco x - ray surface flux , @xmath45  erg / s/@xmath16 ( derived from steltzer et al .",
    "2006 based on chandra observations ) is similar to the detected in class iv - v f5 stars ( see ayres et al .",
    "1995 ) , the civ flux exceeds by @xmath46 orders of magnitude the flux predicted by the active stars civ - x  ray surface flux correlation .",
    "thus , the hler radiation can not be accounted for solely by this mechanism .",
    "the high symmetry of the profiles is suggestive of them being formed in a rotating ionized ring or belt such as the observed around rw  aur ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2003 ) .",
    "however the characteristics of ak  sco orbit imposes severe constraints on the possible location of the material with keplerian - like orbits . on the one hand , circumstellar material",
    "is forced to be between the stellar corona ( @xmath47 ) and the location of the lagrange point at periastron ( 5.5@xmath48 ) .",
    "plasma in such a hypothetical ring systems surrounding each star would be orbiting with velocities in the range @xmath49 km  s@xmath2 and thus , could only contribute to the line wings . on the other hand , the binary cleans the inner region of the circumbinary disk to about 0.43  au thus , any ionized material in this boundary would be rotating at keplerian velocities @xmath50 km  s@xmath2 . as a consequence",
    ", the profile broadening can neither be accounted for by rotating rings around the stars nor by a circumbinary belt .",
    "moreover the low rotation velocity of the stars precludes that line broadening can be accounted by an extended magnetosphere , rigid - body like rotation as shown in fig  2 .",
    "line profiles have been simulated for various emissivity and density profiles for a corotating magnetospheric shell and belt .",
    "the energy radiated in the lines per unit volume , @xmath51 , at a given distance , @xmath52 , from the center of the star is given to first order as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the line emissivity and @xmath55 the density of emitting ions .",
    "as shown in fig  2 , simple spherical and cylindrical distributions ( simulating a shell - like or a belt - like structure , respectively ) can not account for the observed widths of the hler lines .",
    "the optimal fit is obtained by adding a _ maxwellian velocity distribution _ with variance from @xmath5674  km / s for a corotating ring peaking at d=5.5@xmath48 ( @xmath57 = 27.5 and @xmath13 = 1.44 ) to @xmath5688  km / s for a spherical envelope with @xmath58 ( @xmath57 = 19.5 and @xmath13 = 1.2 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the maxwellian velocity field is highly supersonic and blurs the possible kinematical signatures of rotating structures around the star .",
    "ak  sco has an uv excess that accounts by as much as 0.04  l@xmath34 per component . this energy can not be fed into the system solely by the gravitational energy lost by the accretion flow channelled by the surrounding disk since the accretion rates required are about one order of magnitude larger than that derived from the infrared properties of the disk . even if the contribution of the fresh deuterium to the nuclear reactions is taken into account ( siess et al 1997 ) , the accretion rate is a factor of ten smaller than that required to produce the observed luminosity  mev .",
    "the luminosity released is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mass fraction of deuterium in the accreting matter , @xmath61 the avogadro number and the factor of ( 1/2 ) is introduced to account for the deuterium mass number .",
    "assuming a mass fraction deuterium to hydrogen of @xmath62 , solar abundances and an accretion rate of @xmath63  m@xmath34yr@xmath2 , the luminosity excess will be 0.004  l@xmath34 . ] .",
    "the gravitational energy stored in the epicyclic motion of the relative orbit is @xmath64erg where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the masses of the two components of the system , @xmath67 the eccentricity , @xmath68 the semimajor axis and @xmath69 with @xmath70 the period .",
    "if the gravitational energy were dissipated through the hler radiation , it would be damped in a time scale of : @xmath71 which is rather close to the age of ak  sco derived from the evolutionary tracks and the system should be already circularized . henceforth , an additional source of energy needs to be hypothesized to power the hler .",
    "this source also , should be acting in other pre - main sequence stars and be partially responsible of the observed uv excess .",
    "finally , notice that the magnetic diffusivity in the hler , @xmath72 , is very small ( just 0.0045 @xmath16/s ) leading to very high reynolds magnetic numbers and magnetic flux freezing . this has two important consequences : ( 1 ) the tidal deformation wave induces magnetic multipoles into the stellar dipolar fields that can be responsible of the unusually strong periodic polarimetric variations of the system and ( 2 ) the alfvn waves induced by the tide will have very large damping lengths due to magnetic resistivity effects .",
    "the non - linear wave - wave interaction will lead to a turbulent cascade that will end at a scale determined by the dominant damping mechanism . for the hler physical properties",
    ", this will be collisions between the ionized hler material and the neutral infalling gas from the accretion flow that , in turn , strongly depends on the ill determined relative densities of these two components . if the observed broadening of the hler lines is interpreted as a sign of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence this would imply that the inferred mean - field strength of the turbulent component is @xmath73 g .",
    "this value is reasonable for the magnetosphere of a t tauri star where typical surface fields are 0.3 - 1  kg ( johns - krull , 2007 ) .",
    "however , this value would imply that the @xmath74 of the atmospheric plasma is as high as @xmath75!.    to conclude , the observations presented in this letter indicate that ak  sco is the first pre - main sequence binary for which evidence of a highly perturbed atmosphere has been reported .",
    "however , conclusive evidence on the source of the perturbation and the mechanism that drives it , can not be inferred solely from these data .",
    "further uv observations and monitorings are required .",
