    "the composition and the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter , possible phase transitions or condensates are widely discussed in several areas of nuclear physics .",
    "they attain an increasing importance in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "many of the systems under consideration have large charge asymmetries and cover a broad range of densities .",
    "therefore , a deeper understanding of the composition and the thermodynamical properties of nuclear matter , and , in particular , the density dependence of the symmetry energy , from very low to super - saturation densities is of great interest .",
    "let us mention three examples for systems where the knowledge of the symmetry energy in a broad range of densities is of crucial importance : ( 1 ) the surface structure of exotic nuclei with large neutron excess or new exotic collective modes , ( 2 ) the structure and composition of neutron stars from the ultra - dense core to the crust at subsaturation densities with varying asymmetry due to @xmath6-equilibrium , and ( 3 ) core collapse supernovae , where at high densities the symmetry energy determines the energy of the shock , and at low densities it affects the nuclear composition , neutrino interactions and aspects of nucleosynthesis .",
    "this wide spectrum of applications illustrates the importance of gathering reliable information on the eos of nuclear matter , and , specificially , the symmetry energy , since predictions of its density dependence differ strongly for different theoretical approaches .",
    "therefore , considerable efforts have been taken to obtain constraints from observational data on all aspects of the eos",
    ". a promising source of information arises from the study of heavy - ion collisions , where transient states of very different densities can be investigated and the asymmetry can be varied to a certain extent by choosing the collision system .",
    "central collisions at high energies yield large compressions and provide information from observations of nucleon flow @xcite and particle production as shown for kaons , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of studies of the symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions were given in @xcite .",
    "recently , particular interest has been devoted to the properties of nuclear and neutron matter at very low densities , down to the limit of zero density .",
    "below saturation density , correlations are expected to become important and nuclear matter can become inhomogeneous .",
    "an aspect of this is seen in fragmentation as a signature of the liquid - gas phase transition . at even smaller densities , down to one hundredth or one thousandth of saturation density and at moderate temperatures , few - body correlations remain important .",
    "this results from the fact , that at low densities the system can minimize its energy by forming light clusters such as deuterons , or particularly strongly bound @xmath0 particles . with increasing density",
    "such clusters will dissolve due to the pauli principle .",
    "thus there exists an interesting detailed evolution of the correlations and the composition in nuclear matter depending on the density and temperature , which presents a challenge to a theoretical description .    in the laboratory ,",
    "low - density matter occurs in the outer regions of heavy nuclei , in halo nuclei , in expanding hot matter from heavy - ion reactions , in the envelopes of core- collapse supernovae , and also in recently discussed low - density isomeres such as the hoyle state of @xmath7c @xcite .",
    "experimental information on the composition and behavior of very low density nuclear matter was recently obtained by kowalski et al.@xcite from the observation of the light particles emitted in low - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it was found that the fraction of light particles is substantial at very low densities , implying a finite symmetry energy in the limit of zero density .",
    "nonrelativistic skyrme hartree - fock and relativistic mean - field calculations revealed a tight correlation between the density derivative of the neutron matter eos near 2/3 of the saturation density and the neutron skin thickness @xmath8 of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "this observation translates into a correlation of the density dependence of the symmetry energy at saturation density with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the scheduled prex experiment at jlab is expected to provide a precise value of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath9pb from the observation of parity - violations in electron scattering @xcite , hence providing an independent constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .    at densities beyond nuclear saturation constraints on the eos",
    "are expected in increasing quality from neutron star observables as , e.g. , masses , mass - radius relations , gravitational binding energy and the cooling behavior of neutron stars . a recent review by klhn et al .",
    "@xcite discusses these constraints in confrontation with those from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it demonstates that at present it is far from trivial to obtain an eos which is consistent with all these available observational data .",
    "the study of exotic structures like pasta phases in the inner crust of neutron stars gives information on very neutron rich matter around normal densities @xcite .",
    "the actual composition of very low density matter is also relevant for the investigation of various stages in supernova explosions as pointed out in a number of recent publications .",
    "it is known to affect the effectiveness of the neutrino reheating of the shock wave @xcite .",
    "also , the stellar core collapse is mostly determined during the dynamical plunge phase at densities between @xmath10 and @xmath11 g/@xmath12 , where temperatures between @xmath13 and @xmath14 k are reached @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the collapse dynamics on the properties of matter in this density regime could strongly influence the structure and composition of the proto - neutron star @xcite and possible gravitational wave and neutrino signals emitted in various stages during and after core bounce",
    ".    only very few models for the eos are applicable in actual supernova simulations .",
    "the reason is found in the required wide range of temperatures , densities and asymmetries , which are either not available , e.g.  in tabular form , or not covered by the model .",
    "the most frequently used eos are those of lattimer and swesty @xcite and of shen , toki et al .",
    "the former one is based on an extended liquid drop model for the nuclei embedded in a nucleon and @xmath0-particle gas , while the latter one has been developed in the framework of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach with non - linear meson self - couplings @xcite .",
    "shen et al . use the thomas - fermi approximation to describe heavy nuclei embedded in a gas .",
    "they consider @xmath0 particles as a separate species , using an excluded volume prescription to model the dissolution of @xmath0 particles at high densities which accounts for medium effects only in a very global way .",
    "the model neglects other light clusters such as deuterons , tritons , and helions ( @xmath15he ) .",
    "the problem of cluster formation in low - density nuclear matter has been addressed recently based on a virial expansion @xcite to obtain the eos for nuclear matter at all asymmetries including nucleons and @xmath0 particles ( @xmath16he ) @xcite and in later work also tritons and helions @xcite ( see also @xcite for a closely related formulation in an s - matrix approach and the quasiparticle gas model @xcite ) .",
    "the virial coefficients in the beth - uhlenbeck approach @xcite are given by the cluster bound state energies and scattering phase shifts .",
    "@xcite these were taken directly from experiment , thus providing an exact limit for the eos at very low densities , where the scattering is not yet influenced by medium effects .",
    "these results are believed to be reliable for densities up to @xmath17 and not too small temperatures .",
    "they provide a benchmark for other calculations .",
    "the present paper emphasizes that correlations , in - medium modifications of cluster properties and mean - field effects have to be considered simultaneously in the description of low - density nuclear matter , since all these affect the thermodynamical properties of the eos .",
    "the occurence of clusters also changes the symmetry energy , since the cluster correlations depend on the asymmetry of the system . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to matter in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperatures @xmath18 mev and baryon number densities @xmath19 0.2 @xmath4 , where the quark substructure and excitations of internal degrees of freedom of nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) are not important and the nucleon - nucleon interaction can be represented by an effective interaction potential .    in this work , we explore two approaches to the problem : one is a quantum statistical ( qs ) formulation based on the thermodynamic green function method @xcite . this approach makes explicit use of an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it allows us to account for medium effects on the cluster properties .",
    "the second approach is a generalized relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model , where the medium modified clusters are introduced as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "the two methods have their strengths and deficiencies .",
    "the rmf method is reliable to determine the nucleon quasi - particle propagator in the medium , and this information is introduced into the qs model . the qs model , on the other hand ,",
    "can determine the medium modifications of the clusters , such as the mass shift and the ( momentum - dependent ) mott densities , where the clusters get dissolved .",
    "these are then introduced in parametrized form into the rmf method .",
    "the particle number density @xmath20 of protons ( @xmath21 ) or neutrons ( @xmath22 ) depends on the temperature @xmath23 and the chemical potentials @xmath24 . in the qs approach it",
    "is obtained from the single - particle spectral function , which can be expressed in terms of the self - energy .",
    "this is the main quantity to be evaluated . considering the ladder approximation @xcite",
    ", the formation of bound states is taken into account in a bethe - goldstone equation which in the low - density limit reduces to an effective schrdinger equation .",
    "effects of the medium can be included in a self - consistent way within the cluster mean - field approximation ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "the bound state energies are also modified due to pauli blocking in the correlated medium .",
    "an extended discussion of the two - particle problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "this generalized beth - uhlenbeck formulation accounts for medium effects suppressing correlations at high densities .",
    "it allows to determine the second virial coefficient and also contains the brueckner approach to matter near saturation density .",
    "the approach has been extended to three and four - particle bound states in refs .",
    "the medium dependent shift of the cluster binding energies has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize again that this quantum statistical approach avoids the introduction of semi - empirical concepts such as the excluded volume mechanism to mimic in - medium effects .",
    "however , since the quasi - particle propagator is introduced from the outside ( i.e. from the rmf model ) the back effect of the clusters on the mean field is not included .",
    "the rmf model , on the other hand , takes this back reaction fully into account . on the other hand ,",
    "only the bound state contributions of the clusters are included ( from the qs model ) .",
    "thus the continuum contributions are missing , which , as we shall see , leads to an overestimation of the two - particle correlations .",
    "thus , by investigating both these models we also obtain an estimate of the remaining uncertainties of theoretical approaches .",
    "also , in the present work , in both approaches , we have not yet included the contribution of heavier clusters , that should appear in the intermediate density range before the matter becomes homogenous again at densities near saturation .",
    "this problem will be treated in a later work .    extending the quasiparticle approach including the formation of light clusters enables us to describe the smooth transition from the low - density limit , where the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) or the virial expansion are applicable , to the region of the saturation density where",
    "mean - field concepts have been successfully applied .",
    "none of the existing approaches to model the eos gives satisfactory results in both regions simultaneously .",
    "more precisely , the eos of lattimer and swesty @xcite as well as the eos of shen , toki et al .",
    "@xcite fail to reproduce the nse in the low - density limit , while the eos in the virial expansion @xcite ignores medium effects on light clusters and can not describe the dissolution of clusters at high densities .",

    "all models show a decreasing @xmath0-particle fraction with decreasing total baryon number density . however , there are some subtle differences .",
    "the virial expansion ( black dash - dotted lines ) takes scattering contributions to the second virial coefficient into account .",
    "these are important at higher temperatures and cause a slightly higher prediction for @xmath158 at small @xmath50 .",
    "the effect of cluster dissociation is absent in this model and results in an monotonic increase of the cluster fraction with increasing density , which is unphysical since one does not expect to see clusters in nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "the nse approach ( green dotted lines ) compared to the virial approach shows a reduction of the @xmath0-particle fraction at all densities , due to the formation of heavier clusters .",
    "@xmath0-particles survive even beyond the nuclear saturation density , since medium modification and dissolution of clusters are absent in this model , which also fails to describe the transition from clusterized matter to cluster - free nuclear matter at high densities .",
    "the shen et al .",
    "eos ( blue dashed lines ) neglects the contribution of deuteron , triton and helion clusters .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the @xmath0-particle fraction at low densities where actually lighter clusters dominate the composition .",
    "in contrast to the above two approaches , there is a steep decrease of the @xmath0-cluster abundance when approaching the saturation density .",
    "however , one notes some irregularities which are understood as an effect of the excluded volume approach when the closest packing is reached .",
    "the generalized rmf model ( red solid lines ) developed in this work describes the decrease of the @xmath0-particle fraction at high densities by a reduction of their binding energy due to the pauli blocking which leads to the mott effect for vanishing binding .",
    "the maximum cluster density is reached around the mott density . due to the presence of strong correlations in the scattering state continuum which",
    "are effectively represented by one resonance , there is a nonvanishing cluster fraction above the mott density . among all models presented in the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] , the generalized rmf approach shows the strongest reduction of the @xmath0-cluster fraction .    in the qs approach the behavior of the density dependence of @xmath158 is similar to that of the generalized rmf model , but has for all densities a higher @xmath0-cluster fraction , which is accompanied by smaller light cluster abundances .",
    "as discussed in subsect .",
    "[ subsec : comp ] the difference in @xmath158 between the two models is mainly due to the overemphasis of the deuteron correlations in rmf , which suppresses the @xmath0-particle fraction . on the other hand ,",
    "the rmf takes into account the back - reaction of the cluster formation on the mean - field which is missing in the qs approach .    the difference between the two approaches of this paper , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] in direct comparison , also gives an indication of the effects of possible improvements in the models , apart , of course , from the inclusion of heavier clusters , resp .",
    "of nuclei embedded in a clusterized gas . on the other hand , the synopsis of fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] demonstrates the advantage of systematic many - body approaches to the description of cluster formation over alternative approaches which lack a microphysical mechanism to account for the cluster breakup , but which are extensively used , e.g. , in astrophysical applications .",
    "up to now there exist different strategies to model the eos of nuclear matter and , in particular , to extract the symmetry energy : ( 1 ) phenomenological density functional methods , such as non - relativistic skyrme or relativistic rmf functionals , ( 2 ) effective - field theory approaches based on density functional or chiral perturbation theory , or ( 3 ) _ ab initio _ approaches , such as brueckner - type methods , variational calculations or green function methods .",
    "a recent overview over these methods with references can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "these methods are developed to obtain reliable equations of state for nuclear matter for a range of densities and asymmetries .",
    "in particular , the density - dependent rmf model can be considered phenomenologically a very useful approach in this respect since it has been applied with great success in the simultaneous description of cold nuclear matter in finite nuclei and compact stars as well as of hot nuclear matter in heavy - ion collisions and supernova explosions",
    ". however , all these approaches fail in the low - density limit , where cluster formation becomes essential . in this region , simple approaches which take clusters into account , such as the nse or the beth - uhlenbeck formula of the virial expansion , show that clusters give a substantial contribution to the composition and the thermodynamic properties .",
    "on the other hand , models like the nse or the virial expansion fail at higher densities where in - medium effects become important leading to a dissolution of clusters and the transition to cluster - free nuclear matter .    here",
    "we propose , for the first time , a unified treatment that takes both limits into account describing the smooth transition from clusterized matter at low densities to pure nucleonic matter at high densities .",
    "we thus suggest a symbiotic framework which combines the merits of a qs approach in describing cluster properties in a medium with those of the rmf approach to model nucleonic self - energy effects , resulting in two hybrid approaches to the problem of cluster formation and dissolution . on the one hand we use a microscopic qs approach to describe the medium modification of cluster binding energies due to pauli blocking . in this approach",
    "we employ nucleon self - energies taken in parametrized form from a very recent version of the density - dependent rmf model . on the other hand , the results of the qs approach for the cluster properties inside the medium are incorporated into an effective hadronic field theory using a lagrangian formulation .",
    "such a theory already has the correct high - density behavior as deduced from comparisons to heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "we improve the low - density behavior by explicitly including light clusters , such as deuterons , tritons , helions and @xmath0-particles as explicit degrees of freedom taking into account the medium modification of their binding energies from the results of the qs approach .    in the numerical evaluation of both hybrid approaches developed in this work , we find that well - defined clusters appear only for densities below approximately @xmath159 to @xmath160 of the saturation density and get dissolved at higher densities",
    ". a direct confirmation of the given approach can be obtained from a comparison with recent results from heavy - ion collisions at low - energies @xcite .",
    "these investigations indicate larger values for the symmetry energy in comparison with the mean field results at low densities , which seem to be in agreement with our findings @xcite .",
    "realistic approaches to the clustering in low - density nuclear matter should include excited states such as resonances and also the contribution of the continuum of scattering states .",
    "this can be done for the second virial coefficient , as demonstrated by the generalized beth - uhlenbeck approach @xcite . in this way",
    "one can also reach the exact low - density limit of the virial approach @xcite .",
    "compared with the approaches of lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite and shen et al .",
    "@xcite , who employ phenomenological concepts such as the excluded volume , we have given in this work a description of medium effects on the clusters and of their breakup as a result of the fundamental pauli principle .",
    "the extension of the present framework to larger clusters beyond the @xmath0-particle is straightforward along the lines given in this work . for the evaluation of self - energies and pauli shifts of a - particle clusters in nuclear matter ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the given approach to account for clusters of arbitrary size would lead to an improvement in the low - density limit when comparing the nuclear statistical equilibrium as used , e.g. , in multifragmentation models @xcite .",
    "one can alternatively also introduce the formation of heavier nuclei @xcite in the presence of a nucleon and cluster gas , in a similar way as it was done in the thomas - fermi approximation in the shen et al .",
    "this will be relegated to a subsequent paper .",
    "we restricted our present work to that region of the phase diagram where heavier clusters with @xmath161 are not relevant .    in our models",
    ", we constructed the phase transition from clusterized , gaseous low - density matter to a cluster - free nuclear liquid at high densities .",
    "the coexistence region gives a hint about the range in temperature and density where the occurrence of inhomogeneities and the formation of heavy clusters become relevant .",
    "an issue for future investigations is an improved description near the phase transition taking into account effects of the coulomb interaction and charge screening .",
    "we are able to give the composition and the thermodynamic quantities in a large region of densities , temperatures and asymmetries as they are required , e.g. , in supernova simulations .",
    "we did not consider contributions from , e.g. , electrons , neutrinos or photons , to the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "in astrophysical applications of the eos , they have to be included .",
    "they will modify the properties of the system and affect , in particular , the occurence of inhomogeneities and of the liquid - gas phase transition .    as a long - range objective , we aim at a unified description of nuclear matter from very low density to , eventually , the deconfinement phase transition that is based on a more microscopic and self - contained description than previous approaches to the eos which are used up to now in astrophysical models .",

    "<S> the novel feature of this work is to include the formation of clusters as well as their dissolution due to medium effects in a systematic way using two many - body theories : a microscopic quantum statistical ( qs ) approach and a generalized relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model . </S>",
    "<S> nucleons and clusters are modified by medium effects . while the nucleon quasiparticle properties are determined within the rmf model from the scalar and vector self energies , the cluster binding energies are reduced due to pauli blocking shifts calculated in the qs approach . </S>",
    "<S> both approaches reproduce the limiting cases of nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) at low densities and cluster - free nuclear matter at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of the cluster dissociation is based on the mott effect due to pauli blocking , implemented in slightly different ways in the qs and the generalized rmf approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to somewhat different results in the intermediate density range of about @xmath2 to @xmath3  @xmath4 , which gives an estimate of the present accuracy of the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the numerical results of these models for cluster abundances and thermodynamics in the region of medium excitation energies with temperatures @xmath5 and baryon number densities from zero to a few times saturation density . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of cluster formation on the liquid - gas phase transition and on the density dependence of the symmetry energy is studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the parabolic approximation for the asymmetry dependence of the nuclear equation of state breaks down at low temperatures and at subsaturation densities due to cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> comparison is made with other theoretical approaches , in particular those , which are commonly used in astrophysical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are relevant for heavy - ion collisions and astrophysical applications . </S>"
