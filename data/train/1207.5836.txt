    "we investigate the stability of this model to the presence of magnetic interactions on the removed bonds of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic sign , and show that for small bond strengths the residual entropy in the spin system approaches that of the sorrel net to quite low temperatures prior to undergoing a secondary transition to a state still possessing a finite residual entropy in the @xmath19 limit .",
    "in this paper we introduce a 1/9th depleted triangular net as shown in fig.[figure1](a ) of symmetry p6 mm .",
    "one sees that the substitution of non - magnetic atoms ( which themselves form a triangular lattice@xcite ) for every third atom along each of the basis vectors of the triangular lattice leads to an edge - shared net with sites 6-fold and 5-fold coordinated .",
    "amazingly , the symmetric selective removal of 1/7 of the bonds on this lattice leads to a new highly frustrated _ corner - shared _ equilateral triangle two - dimensional net as shown in fig . [ figure1](b ) .",
    "this creates a net reminiscent of _ oxalis regnelli triangularis _ ( commonly known as wood sorrel ) leaves as pictured in fig.[figure1](c ) , and for this reason we will henceforth refer to this kagome - inspired net as the sorrel net .",

    "the regular substitution of non - magnetic atoms into a frustrated magnetic sublattice of a material is a useful way of predicting and perhaps generating new candidate exotic materials .",
    "one such material is the quantum spin liquid candidate na@xmath8ir@xmath10o@xmath11@xcite , which features @xmath26 ir atoms at three of the four corners of the corner - shared tetrahedral lattice ( common to the pyrochlore and b - site spinel geometries ) .",
    "the ir atoms in this material are arranged to create a three - dimensional corner - shared triangle hyperkagome lattice .",
    "non - magnetic na atoms sit at the fourth corner of each tetrahedron , and whether because of substantial size differences@xcite between na@xmath27 and ir@xmath28 ions or electrostatic interactions with surrounding atoms , the na ions spread throughout the lattice in a regular pattern .      in this context , it is interesting to note that triangular lattice depletions of the triangular lattice not only yield the ( @xmath0th doped ) sorrel lattice presented here , but also a number of frustrated lattices for which experimental candidates have already been found",
    ". an impressive collection of pictures of possible trigonally symmetric lattices derived by periodic site depletion is presented in the electronic supplementary information to ref . .",
    "most notably , the much studied kagome lattice , a @xmath29 doped triangular lattice , has recently been realized experimentally in the materials volborthite@xcite , herbertsmithite@xcite , kapellasite@xcite , haydeeite@xcite , vesignieite@xcite , and cs@xmath7cu@xmath10snf@xmath30@xcite .",
    "many of these minerals are cu based as experimentalists search for low spin quantum spin liquid candidates .",
    "additionally , artificial spin ice on the kagome lattice was first produced by qi _",
    "et al._@xcite    the @xmath1th depleted triangular lattice , the maple leaf lattice , was introduced in 1995 and has candidate materials : m@xmath31[fe(o@xmath7cch@xmath7)@xmath7nch@xmath7po@xmath10]@xmath33h@xmath70 where @xmath34 if m is na or k , and @xmath35 if m is rb@xcite and spangolite@xcite . even the triangular kagome lattice realized by the cu atoms@xcite in cu@xmath36x@xmath7(2-carboxypentonic acid)@xmath37@xmath38xh@xmath70 , where @xmath39 is f , cl or br , studied by loh _",
    "et al._@xcite is a triangular lattice @xmath17th depletion of a triangular lattice , where each point of the triangular lattice removes 7 spins .",
    "the natural extension of the doping of the triangular lattice from the kagome lattice ( which removes every second spin along the reciprocal lattice vectors ) , to the sorrel lattice ( which removes every third spin ) , would lead to the removal of every fourth spin along the reciprocal lattice vectors for a @xmath40th doping .",
    "interestingly , for such a lattice it is not possible to remove bonds to create a new corner - sharing triangle lattice .",
    "however , the selective removal of edge - sharing bonds analogous to setting @xmath6 on the sorrel lattice , would create an interesting potentially frustrated lattice  featuring a star of david decoration inside each empty hexagon of the triangular kagome lattice .",
    "is it possible to create a regular @xmath0th site depleted triangular magnetic lattice in an insulator ?",
    "we were pleasantly surprised to learn that this has indeed recently been achieved in a new cobalt hydroxide oxalate co@xmath30(oh)@xmath41(c@xmath7o@xmath8)@xmath10(c@xmath8n@xmath7h@xmath42 ) by keene _",
    "et al._@xcite . in this material",
    "the planar co atoms are octahedrally oxygen coordinated , with @xmath0 of the octahedra empty .",
    "unfortunately , above and below the empty ( in - plane ) octahedra are co atoms .",
    "three oxygen atoms from the tetrahedra forming the base of a tetrahedral coordination of these co atoms with nitrogen providing the apical atom of the tetrahedra .",
    "it is not immediately clear what effect couplings to such tetrahedral co atoms might create , although even a weak coupling between the tetrahedral co atoms might make a strong ( ferromagnetic ) perturbation on the hexagon of co atoms nearest to them .",
    "additionally , this layered material has a 2 dimensional honeycomb network of oxalate mediated couplings between co ions .",
    "magnetically , this material shows interesting , although perhaps not frustrated behavior , apparently antiferromagnetically ordering at @xmath43 despite an antiferromagnetic weiss constant of only about 3.6 k. given that the authors@xcite expect an antiferromagnetic coupling in the honeycomb layer of 18@xmath44k from previous work@xcite , it seems natural to ask whether or not the bonds of the sorrel layers in this material indeed have antiferromagnetic couplings , or are contributing to lowering the effective weiss constant .",
    "one expects that the predominant interaction between co atoms in the plane is via superexchange through the joining oxygen sites , and that as the co - o - co bond varies from 180@xmath45 to 90@xmath45 at some angle ( roughly 120@xmath45 in the cuprates ) ferromagnetic exchange will be favored over antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "of the four in plane bonds presented by the authors , @xmath46 involving planar co atoms , our j@xmath47 corresponds to the assumption of equal bond strengths on their @xmath48 and @xmath49 , our @xmath5 corresponds to their @xmath50 and their @xmath51 is a new bond to the tetragonal co atoms .",
    "while it would be interesting to carry out a detailed calculation of these exchange integrals in future work , navely from bond angle considerations@xcite one would say that @xmath51 is likely to be weakly antiferromagnetic , @xmath48 and @xmath49 may well be weakly ferromagnetic , and @xmath50 is likely to be weakly ferromagnetic . as such",
    ", one might expect that this system falls in a regime not covered in this work , of ferromagnetic @xmath2 and @xmath5",
    ". it would certainly also be interesting if a local probe such as oxygen nmr could be used to determine the signs of the magnetic couplings within the plane .",
    "if , on the other hand , it were shown that this material possesses an antiferromagnetic @xmath2 , one might hope to exploit the differences between the atomic sizes of octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated co@xmath52 ions to design a non - magnetic substitution .",
    "for example , according to shannon@xcite , tetrahedrally coordinated mg@xmath52 is very close in size to tetrahedrally coordinated co@xmath52 , while the octahedral coordinated ions of both species are of quite different sizes , suggesting that if it were possible to substitute mg atoms for co atoms , the mg atoms might preferentially enter the tetrahedral site , removing some complicating non - frustrated magnetic physics .      while we view the solution of the ising model on the sorrel lattice as a simple test whether or not antiferromagnetism would be frustrated on this net , it is interesting to speculate on how this , or related models might be realized in an experimental system . in particular , one might wonder how magnetic exchange processes could lead to an antiferromagnetic @xmath2 and a weak , non - existent , or ferromagnetic @xmath5 , even if the magnetic atoms of a crystal could be arranged into the @xmath0th doped triangular net .",
    "one could imagine@xcite superexchange pathways via say oxygen atoms living at the midpoints of the @xmath2 bonds leading to a strong antiferromagnetic coupling on these bonds alone .",
    "indeed even oxygen atoms lying at the center of the @xmath2 triangles would likely lead to weakly antiferromagnetic @xmath2 bonds .",
    "such interactions might be expected to produce at least roughly equal strength bonds around both the 6-coordinated and 4-coordinated spin sites , as we have assumed in this work . to additionally realize ising spins would likely require strong crystal field anisotropies in the out of plane direction , leading to a magnetically easy axis .      that the sorrel net is two - dimensional opens a host of possible realizations for further study .",
    "for example , recent advances in the study of spinless bosons trapped by optical lattices have allowed the simulation of models of frustrated magnetism on the triangular lattice with couplings of various magnitudes.@xcite could such studies be extended to the doped triangular lattices ? from soft condensed matter , the study of magnetic colloids interacting via the dipolar interaction offers the possibility of real time manipulation of a lattice using optical tweezers to perhaps create a mesoscopic frustrated lattice of choice.@xcite    while it may be currently unrealistic@xcite to expect the creation of a direct artificial realization of a dipolar ising model on the sorrel lattice with moments pointing out of the plane , the construction of a coplanar artificial spin ice structure should be feasible . as for ( lithographically etched ) realizations of artificial spin ice on the kagome lattice *",
    "* * , a permalloy island could be to chosen to point locally along the axis of symmetry of the triangle .",
    "while such islands could join the centers of the triangles about the 4-coordinated spins sites , a new and interesting feature for study would arise at the 6-coordinated spin sites .",
    "three overlapping ferromagnetic islands ( with a @xmath53 symmetry ) would mimic a multiorbital local ising spin at these vertices , producing a novel interplay between short range contact terms ( hund s coupling and ferromagnetic interactions ) with the long range dipolar interaction .",
    "we have begun @xcite the study of ferromagnetic interactions between such local ising spins in the presence of hund s coupling terms and find , at least to this approximation , that degeneracy remains in the ground state of the sorrel lattice .",
    "unfortunately , this multiorbital nature appears to prevent the creation of a macroscopic spin ice along the lines of that created by mellado _",
    "et al._@xcite    the question of what quantum magnetism will do on the sorrel lattice is left for future work . when considering frustrated quantum spin systems , perhaps the simplest model is that of the quantum transverse ising model@xcite , the study of which is considerably simplified for low dimensional lattices .",
    "we@xcite have begun to investigate classical dimer models on the sorrel lattice using the pfaffian approach .",
    "the hope is that as on the triangular lattice , the classical and quantum dimer models may be related , and there may be a mapping@xcite to the quantum transverse ising model .",
    "we have studied the antiferromagnetic ising model on a new corner - shared equilateral triangle net , finding a large finite residual entropy @xmath3 = 0.48185@xmath40.00008 , slightly larger than the corresponding pauling entropy @xmath54 .",
    "we have shown that the spin - spin correlations remain disordered to the lowest temperature , with the structure factor showing broad disperse peaks about @xmath55 and @xmath53 rotations .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility indicates that strong antiferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to short range ordering at low temperatures , with a curie tail with slope close to that one would expect were @xmath29 of the ising spins completely free .",
    "while we have not proposed an exact solution , our results are remarkably independent of system size , indicating that the thermodynamic limit is quickly reached .    to this corner - shared triangle sorrel net",
    "we have added edge - sharing bonds ( @xmath5 ) which are likely to remain present in physical realizations of the doped triangular lattice , and investigated the phase diagram produced by varying the magnitude and sign of this coupling constant .    for antiferromagnetic edge - sharing couplings ( @xmath56 ) , we have shown that at low temperatures our spin system adopts a partially ordered state with ising spins at the 6-coordinated sites completely free , and all other neighboring spins antiferromagnetically correlated , resulting in sharp magnetic bragg peaks at @xmath57 and @xmath53 rotations .",
    "this allows us to write exact solutions for the ground state entropy @xmath58 and the low temperature curie tail of the susceptibility , results which are supported numerically .    for ferromagnetic edge - sharing couplings ( @xmath59 )",
    ", we have shown that at sufficiently low temperatures all combinations of ferromagnetically aligned spins across edge - sharing ( @xmath5 ) bonds are equally realized , resulting in diffuse magnetic scattering about @xmath55 and @xmath53 rotations , similar to the pure sorrel net case .",
    "in contrast to this pure case , we have shown that the low temperature susceptibility shows a considerably stronger curie tail , which we have found to be consistent with exact @xmath60 results . knowing the ground state , we have found an exact expression for the residual entropy @xmath61 of the spin system which is supported numerically .",

    "<S> we study the antiferromagnetic classical ising ( afi ) model on the sorrel net , a @xmath0th site depleted and @xmath1th bond depleted triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our classical monte carlo simulations , verified by exact results for small system sizes , show that the afi model on this corner - shared triangle net ( with coupling constant @xmath2 ) is highly frustrated , with a residual entropy of @xmath3= 0.48185@xmath40.00008 . anticipating that it may be difficult to achieve perfect bond depletion , we investigate the physics originating from turning back on the deleted bonds ( @xmath5 ) to create a lattice of edge - sharing triangles . below a critical temperature which grows linearly with @xmath5 for small @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the nature of the unusual magnetic ordering and present analytic expressions for the low temperature residual entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the static structure factor and find evidence for long range partial order for antiferromagnetic @xmath5 , and short range magnetic order otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility crosses over from following a curie - weiss law at high temperatures to a low temperature curie law whose slope clearly distinguishes ferromagnetic @xmath5 from the @xmath6 case . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly comment on a recent report @xcite of the creation of a @xmath0th site depleted triangular lattice cobalt hydroxide oxalate . </S>"
