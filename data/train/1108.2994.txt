    "luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) are small , but vigorously star forming galaxies . the star formation rates ( sfrs ) per unit mass are high and the star formation activity involves up to @xmath4 of the total galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "lcbgs are a major contributor to the cosmic sfr increase in the last @xmath5 gyr @xcite and are related to distant lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the brightest blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , local hii and starburst nuclei galaxies ( sbns ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and intermediate - redshift compact narrow emission - line galaxies ( cnelgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "their presence at different redshifts denotes their cosmological relevance and implies that local starburst galaxies , when properly selected , are unique laboratories for studying the complex ecosystem of the star formation process over time .",
    "two key questions regarding the nature of lcbgs remain unanswered : ( i ) what is the role of mergers or other interactions in triggering the burst of star formation ? ; and ( ii ) what is the role of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and supernova ( sn ) driven galactic winds in quenching the star formation and limiting the stellar mass ?",
    "previous results show that while approximately 50% of local lcbgs are not isolated and have close optical companions ( some gas - rich companions are only revealed by means of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations ; e.g. , pisano et al . in preparation ,",
    "* ) , only @xmath6 of field galaxies are not isolated @xcite . a correlation between the kinematic signatures of recent interactions in lcbgs and their environment would imply that these interactions are responsible for triggering the enhanced star formation in lcbgs .",
    "kinematic signatures of recent interactions should be easy to identify by means of velocity and velocity width maps .",
    "in particular , major and minor mergers cause deviations from smooth rotation , which can be identified with high resolution data . as an example , @xcite studied whether a minor or a major merger in ngc 7673 was responsible for triggering the enhanced star formation in this particular galaxy .",
    "they , as well as @xcite , concluded that while its asymmetric outer features point to a major merger , the inner disk structure constrains the strength of the event to the scale of a minor one .",
    "we extend the study of @xcite to include 22 objects in this paper .    another interesting feature of lcbgs is that their typical stellar masses ( i.e. , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , place them at the location of the upper limit of galaxies belonging to the  blue cloud \" ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their stellar masses turn lcbgs into unique laboratories to investigate why the star formation and the stellar mass growth stop in blue galaxies .",
    "quenching mechanisms include massive halos , agns , and sn - driven galactic winds .",
    "halo mass measurements are needed to study the effects of massive halos , while both flux and kinematic signatures are needed to study the presence of agn and sn driven galactic winds in these galaxies .",
    "halo mass estimates can be inferred from hi dynamical masses . instead of ionized gas , neutral atomic gas is used because it traces the gravitational potential to larger radii .",
    "typical hi dynamical mass estimates of lcbgs are between @xmath10 and @xmath11 as shown by @xcite and pisano et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , by comparing resolved hi dynamical masses with dynamical masses derived from our optical analysis , we can infer the actual dynamical masses of distant lcbgs , where we can not measure neutral atomic gas fluxes .",
    "other quenching mechanisms include agns and sn - driven galactic winds @xcite . while the presence of quasars can be ruled out after investigating the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra of these galaxies , we can not rule out the presence of faint agns in lcbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , optical integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) has the potential of revealing the presence of low - level agn by means of unusually high line ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath12 and [ nii]/h@xmath13 @xcite , and spectrally resolved kinematic components with broad full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) . furthermore , the extent and strength of such kinematic subcomponents allows us to quantify the outflow / inflow of gas from / onto galaxies by means of the study of their line profiles@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that ifs can derive these properties as a function of position within the galaxy .",
    "in addition , we can use local lcbgs as a template for studies of distant blue starbursts at z@xmath141 .",
    "recent surveys aim to characterize the spatially resolved kinematics of distant ( i.e. , from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ) starbursts by means of ifs using instruments such as giraffe and sinfoni at the very large telescope of the european southern observatory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nearby lcbgs can be used as proxies for learning about the formation , nature , and evolution of distant starbursts , and to simulate observations of those in order to help us properly interpret the results of current and future distant surveys ( gruel et al . in preparation ) .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we showed the analysis of prototypical lcbg ngc 7673 .",

    "we focus on the optical kinematic properties of a sample of 22 lcbgs , and show their three dimensional optical spectroscopy observations .",
    "we use these to shed light on the questions highlighted above .",
    "flux related properties , such as sfrs , metallicities , and extinctions , are discussed in castillo - morales et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    throughout this paper we assume a flat universe with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we describe our sample selection , observations , data reduction , and measurements ; the analysis and discussion are carried on in section 3 ; and finally , in section 4 , we summarize our work .",
    "lcbgs are starburst galaxies which form a continuous distribution in luminosity , surface brightness , and color .",
    "our observational selection criteria @xcite select objects with ( i ) absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath20 ) brighter than @xmath21  mag ; ( ii ) effective surface brightness ( @xmath22 ) brighter than 21 @xmath23-mag  arcsec@xmath24 ; and ( iii ) rest - frame @xmath25 color bluer than 0.6  mag .",
    "these criteria ensure similarity between nearby lcbgs and distant blue starbursts seen in wide - field hubble space telescope imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "we selected 20 local ( @xmath26  mpc ) lcbgs from the data release 4 ( dr4 ; * ? ? ? * ) of the sdss and ucm catalogs .",
    "we completed our sample with ngc 7714 , and sdss 1703b ( companion to sdss 1703a , with properties within 1-@xmath27 of our selection criteria ) for a total of 22 objects ( table  [ table : sample ] ) .",
    "note that these sources cover the whole range of @xmath20 , @xmath28 , and @xmath25 of the complete sample of local lcbgs in the dr4 of the sdss ; their properties are listed in table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "for this purpose we refer to our sample as representative of the lcbg population .",

    "furthermore , weak contamination lines from the thar lamp used to illuminate the calibration fibers were also used for this purpose . despite our efforts to produce an arc frame by combining different arcs , the reduced , poor quality of the lines and the inability to produce this calibration frame at the same telescope position as the actual observations , the rms of the best fit polynomial ( @xmath55 ) translated into a higher uncertainty of at least 0.25   ( 15  km  s@xmath51 at 5000   ) .",
    "a better wavelength calibration was possible during the last two runs .",
    "it was performed using both he and cs lamps simultaneously with up to 12 lines within the considered spectral range .",
