    "this paper deals with the construction of the proper  wavelet  tools for the analysis of functions which are _ vector - valued_. such type of functions arises naturally in many applications where the data to be processed are samples of vector - valued functions , even in several variables ( e.g. electroencephalographic measurements , seismic waves , color images ) .    up to now , most signal processing methods handle vector valued data component by component and thus ignore the possible relationship between several of the components .",
    "in reality , on the other hand , such measurements are usually related and thus should be processed as `` complete '' vectors . while it is obvious that for vector valued signals a standard scalar wavelet analysis does not take into account the correlations among components , even an approach based on the well known _",
    "multiwavelets _ , introduced in @xcite , @xcite and widely studied ( see @xcite and the exhaustive references therein ) , is only apparently justified by the  vectorization  step required in order to apply them .",
    "indeed , multiwavelets still generate multiresolution analyses for the space of scalar - valued functions .    in @xcite , @xcite _ matrix wavelets",
    "_ have been proposed for the analysis of matrix valued signals while in @xcite the concept of _ multichannel wavelet _ ( mcw ) and _ multichannel multiresolution analysis _ ( mcmra ) have been introduced for processing vector - valued data .",
    "actually , the two concepts look very similar : the crucial point of both is the existence of a matrix refinable function , which satisfies the so - called _ full rank condition_. however , on one hand , the matrix analysis scheme proposed in @xcite , @xcite coincides with the applications of a fixed number of mcw schemes , on the other hand , only a very special characterization of filters is proposed , which gives rise to interpolatory orthonormal matrix refinable functions . thanks to this special structure , the corresponding wavelet filters are easily found as in the scalar situation .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite , @xcite the authors do not provide either any constructive strategy nor any example .",
    "some examples of @xmath0 matrix wavelets are derived in @xcite , but they strongly rely on the sufficient condition for convergence described in @xcite , and belong again to a very special class . in passing ,",
    "we also mention reference @xcite since , in spite of the title , it actually contains examples of wavelet filters specifically designed for vector - fields .    in some recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we investigated _ full rank interpolatory schemes _ and showed their connection to matrix refinable functions and multichannel wavelets .",
    "in particular we proved that there is a connection between _ cardinal _ and _ orthogonal _ matrix refinable functions which is based on the _ spectral factorization _ of the ( positive definite ) symbol related to the cardinal function , thus , as a by - product , giving a concrete way to obtain orthogonal matrix scaling functions .",
    "the corresponding multichannel wavelets , whose existence is proved in @xcite , can be found in terms of a symbol which satisfies _ matrix quadrature mirror filter _ equations .    in this paper",
    ", we show how the solution of matrix quadrature mirror filter equations can be found .",
    "in particular we give an efficient and constructive scheme which makes use again of spectral factorization techniques and of a matrix completion algorithm based on the resolution of generalized bezout identities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "all the needed notation and definitions are set .",

    "section  5 deals with the construction of multichannel wavelets and an explicit algorithm for such construction is presented . in section  6 , starting from some interpolatory full rank positive definite symbols , the associated multichannel wavelets with two and three channels are constructed and shown .",
