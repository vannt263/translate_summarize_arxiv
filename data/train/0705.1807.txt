    "in more recent studies , synchronization has been observed in fireflies , pacemaker cells , networks of neurons , etc@xcite . in brain activity , it has been found that cognitive acts , such as face perception , is associated with zero - lag ( i.e. , isochronal ) synchronization of gamma oscillations@xcite .",
    "other studies have shown neural synchronization in widely separated areas of cortical regions @xcite .    in a recent publication ,",
    "fisher _ et al._@xcite reported the phenomenon of zero - lag long range synchronization via dynamical relaying .",
    "that is , when one has two coupled systems , with delay between them , introducing a third one will allow synchronization between the two outer elements in regions of the parameter space where this was impossible without the middle element . in their letter",
    "they showed that this occurs for coupled lasers ( in experimental and numerical studies ) , coupled neurons and stated that they observed the same phenomenon in a large variety of dynamical systems ( such as excitable systems , oscillators and maps ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an explanation for this phenomenon .",
    "we find that this occurs because two identical systems lose synchronization as the delay between them is increased in such a way that they get in antiphase synchronization .",
    "that is , in the case of oscillators their phase separation is @xmath0 .",
    "when a third element is added between those elements , then the middle element will be in antiphase with the outer elements and therefore the outer elements will be inphase . here",
    "we call the attention to the fact that it is not any finite delay that will cause loss of synchronization between two coupled systems , as we will see below . for loss of synchronization to occur the delay has to be in a given range of values and",
    "therefore this phenomenon is only important in that region .    in their letter ,",
    "fisher _ et al . _",
    "studied bidirectional coupling between the middle and outer elements . here",
    "we show that nearly identical results can be obtained in a simpler configuration , that is , the subsystem coupling as studied in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate our results in quadratic maps@xcite , kuramoto@xcite and coupled rssler@xcite oscillators . in the case of kuramoto oscillators , we show analytically that when all the oscillators are identical , synchronization between the two outer elements always occur , independently of the delay and coupling values . although the synchronization properties do not depend on if the coupling is bidirectional or of the subsystem type , in both cases it is necessary that the parameters of the outer elements be the same .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we study zero - lag synchronization via dynamical relaying in a discrete time system , that is , the quadratic map .",

    "therefore , studying the region of synchronization for a given initial condition , may not give a full picture of the synchronization region .",
