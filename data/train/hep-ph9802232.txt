    "two of the most intriguing questions in particle physics are the the ewsb mechanism and the origin of fermion masses .",
    "although the sm remains a successful theory when compared with all the available data , it lacks predictability in the higgs sector , which determines the masses of gauge bosons , as well as of fermions through _ ad hoc _ yukawa couplings .",
    "this suggests the possibility that new physics beyond the sm might be associated with either of these questions . in general , the energy scales and dynamics behind the ewsb sector and",
    "the fermion masses may be unrelated . in order to avoid fine - tuning ,",
    "the scale associated with ewsb can not be much higher than a few  tev , whereas the scales where light fermion masses are generated could be much higher .",
    "if the mechanism responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry involves some new strong dynamics , deviations from the sm might be observable in low energy signals even at energies much smaller than the scale of new physics @xmath0 . reaching this new frontier by direct observation of new physical states or even of tree - level effects in the couplings of sm particles ,",
    "may require not only very large energies but also some previous knowledge of what ( and what not ) to expect .",
    "thus , low energy measurements might be of paramount importance in planning experiments and search strategies at high energy machines . among these low energy signals are electroweak measurements such as those at lep and the tevatron .",
    "on the other hand , processes involving flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) can play a complementary role , since the fact that these processes are largely suppressed or forbidden in the sm may compensate the suppression by factors of @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the low energy scale , e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . ) . here",
    "we address the potential of rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays as a complement to other low energy measurements in constraining models where strong dynamics is associated to either the ewsb sector and/or the origin of fermion masses . in the absence of a completely satisfactory theory of dynamical symmetry breaking and fermion masses , it is convenient to carry out a model - independent analysis that makes maximum use of the known properties of the electroweak interactions .",
    "this is the case with the ewsb sector , where an effective lagrangian approach allows us to parameterize the effects of the new strong dynamics in very much the same way chiral perturbation theory parameterizes low energy qcd . on the other hand , the effects from fermion mass generation",
    "can also be addressed by a general operator analysis . however , in addition , most theories predict the existence of relatively light states ( scalars , pseudo - goldstone bosons , etc . ) which generally couple to mass in one way or another . to exemplify the effects of such states ( which can not be integrated out ) we work with a particular set of models known as topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tatc ) .",
    "this provides a current example of how strong dynamics model building deals with the large top - quark mass and illustrates the distinct low energy phenomenology emerging from non - standard ewsb scenarios .",
    "in the absence of a light higgs boson the symmetry breaking sector is represented by a non - renormalizable effective lagrangian corresponding to the non - linear realization of the @xmath7 model .",
    "the essential feature is the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry @xmath8 . to leading order the interactions involving the goldstone bosons associated with this mechanism and the gauge fields are described by the effective lagrangian  @xcite @xmath9 + \\frac{v^2}{4}{{\\rm tr}}\\left[d_\\mu u^\\dagger d^\\mu u\\right ] , \\label{lo}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 $ ] are the the @xmath12 and @xmath13 field strengths respectively , the electroweak scale is @xmath14  gev and the goldstone bosons enter through the matrices @xmath15 .",
    "the covariant derivative acting on @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 . to this order",
    "there are no free parameters once the gauge boson masses are fixed .",
    "the dependence on the dynamics underlying the strong symmetry breaking sector appears at next to leading order . to this order ,",
    "a complete set of operators includes one operator of dimension two and nineteen operators of dimension four @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian to next to leading order in the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimension two custodial - symmetry violating term absent in the heavy higgs limit of the sm . if we restrict ourselves to cp invariant structures , there remain fifteen operators of dimension four .",
    "the coefficients of some of these operators are constrained by low energy observables .",
    "for instance precision electroweak observables constrain the coefficient of @xmath19 , which gives a contribution to the electroweak parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 limit requires @xmath22    the combinations @xmath23 and @xmath24 contribute to the electroweak parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , the constraint on @xmath25 translates into @xmath27    in addition , the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 modify the triple gauge - boson couplings ( tgc ) and will be probed at lepii and the tevatron at the few percent level @xcite .",
    "the remaining operators contribute to oblique corrections only to one loop and , in some cases , only starting at two loops . to the last group belong @xmath32 and @xmath33 given that their contributions to the gauge boson two - point functions only affect the longitudinal piece of the propagators .",
    "of particular interest is the operator @xmath32 defined by @xcite @xmath34 ,   \\label{defo11}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and the covariant derivative acting on @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath38 field strength imply @xcite @xmath39 where the @xmath13 current is @xmath40 , @xmath41 denote the left - handed fermion doublets .",
    "the dominant effect appears in the quark sector due to the presence of terms proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "after the quark fields are rotated to the mass eigenstate basis , the operator @xmath32 can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the @xmath45 are cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and the dots stand for terms suppressed by small fermion masses .    from the above discussion",
    "we see that the leading effects of the ewsb sector in fcnc processes are coming from the insertion of anomalous tgc vertices and four - fermion operators like ( [ ffo11 ] ) . in the rest of this section , we review the status and future impact of these constraints on the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "the effects of the four - fermion operators in ( [ ffo11 ] ) in rare b and k decays were considered in ref .",
    "the loop insertion will result in contributions to several fcnc processes , that are controlled by both the coefficient @xmath46 of the effective lagrangian ( [ lnlo ] ) as well as by the high energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "to one loop , only one parameter is needed , namely @xmath47 this parameter also governs the contributions of ( [ ffo11 ] ) to other neutral processes , both flavor changing and flavor conserving .",
    "for instance , the @xmath48 term in ( [ ffo11 ] ) gives a contribution to @xmath49 , whereas the terms like @xmath50 appear in @xmath51 mixing  @xcite .",
    "thus the measurements of @xmath52 and the rate of @xmath5 mixing ( together with all other ckm information ) can be used to derive a bound on @xmath53 .",
    "although the bound carries some uncertainty mainly associated with ckm quantities like @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we will take it to be , approximately  @xcite @xmath56 next , we use this as the allowed range for @xmath53 in order to explore the possible impact of this physics in rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays .",
    "the one - loop insertion of the terms @xmath57 induces new contributions to various fcnc vertices in @xmath5 decays ( the first two terms in ( [ rareo11 ] ) ) , as well as in @xmath6 decays ( third term in ( [ rareo11 ] ) ) .",
    "first , let us consider @xmath58 processes leading , for instance , to the inclusive @xmath59 , since this rate has been recently measured  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop insertion of the operator @xmath32 does not give a contribution to these processes given that it does not mix with the operator @xmath60 responsible for the on - shell photon amplitude .",
    "mixing only occurs at two loops , when qcd corrections are taken into account . as a result the effect , in all @xmath58 transitions is expected to be only a few percent of the sm branching ratios  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the off - shell amplitudes for photons , @xmath61 s and gluons are non - zero at one loop .",
    "they generate contributions to processes such as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; as well as to similar rare kaon decays like @xmath65 , etc . in order to asses",
    "the potential effects we define @xmath66 which is plotted in fig .  1 as a function of the parameter @xmath53 defined in ( [ ydef ] ) , for the allowed range of @xmath53 ( [ ybound ] ) .",
    "analogously , we can define the ratio @xmath67 , which tracks the effects in @xmath68 decays ; whereas the contribution to gluon penguin processes such as @xmath69 is represented by the ratio @xmath70 . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the effects of the operator @xmath32 are very similar in all three types of @xmath5 decays .",
    "we see that , even with the @xmath52 and @xmath71 mixing constraints , large deviations from the sm predictions for these modes are possible .",
    "the current experimental bounds on these processes are still not binding on @xmath53 .",
    "however , sensitivity to sm branching ratios will be reached in the next round of experiments at the various @xmath5 factories at cornell , kek , slac and fermilab .",
    "the distinct feature of this effect is that no significant deviation is expected in @xmath72 , even when large deviations are observed in all the other modes .",
    "the effects are very similar in rare @xmath6 decays such as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , etc . in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath75 , a quantity analogous to @xmath76 in ( [ defrat ] ) .",
    "again , large effects of up to factors of @xmath77 deviations , are allowed .",
    "the recently reported  @xcite observation of one event in @xmath73 roughly translates into @xmath78 , which is still not constraining .",
    "although in this model - independent approach we can not , as a matter of principle , calculate the size of the coefficients @xmath79 , we can use general arguments to estimate their approximate value .",
    "using naive dimensional analysis  @xcite we have @xmath80 with the scale of new physics obeying @xmath81 .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath82 , one would obtain @xmath83 . on the other hand , if @xmath84 , one has @xmath85 . in any case , these are meant to be order of magnitude estimates .",
    "therefore , the experimental relevance of the effect strongly depends on details of the dynamics we are not able to compute in a model - independent fashion .",
    "finally , we should note that rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays are the most sensitive signals for this effect .",
    "this is due to the fact that four - lepton operators are suppressed by the lepton masses , and that @xmath32 does not mix quarks and leptons .      imposing @xmath86 and @xmath87 conservation , the most general form of the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) couplings",
    "can be written as  @xcite @xmath90 with the conventional choices being @xmath91 and @xmath92  @xcite . in principle , there are six free parameters . making contact with the electroweak lagrangian ( [ lnlo ] )",
    ", these parameters can be expressed in terms of the next - to - leading order coefficients  @xcite @xmath93 and @xmath31 .",
    "conservation of the electromagnetic charge implies @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , to this order in the energy expansion ( [ lnlo ] ) @xmath95 . then we are left with @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "finally , when considering rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays , we can neglect the contribution of @xmath97 since it will be suppressed by powers of the small external momenta over @xmath99 .",
    "thus , in this simplistic approach , there are only two parameters relevant at very low energies .",
    "the sm predicts @xmath100 .",
    "the effects of anomalous tgc have been previously studied in the literature  @xcite . however",
    ", this hierarchical approach to the couplings has not been the one used in the various analyses and a more comprehensive study is needed . the experiments at lep  ii and the next tevatron run are going to be sensitive to deviations from the sm prediction at the @xmath101 level  @xcite .",
    "effects of this size might be also observed in rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 can produce enhancements in the branching ratios of @xmath103 decay modes of up to @xmath104  @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "@xmath5 factory experiments will have sensitivity to these processes at the sm level , turning these low energy measurements into an excellent complement of direct probes of the tgc .",
    "up to now , we have only considered the effects of the dynamics associated with the ewsb .",
    "these are encoded in the effective lagrangian ( [ lnlo ] ) , which only involves the goldstone boson and gauge fields . additionally , it is possible that the new strong dynamics may also affect some or all fermions .",
    "we first comment on the effective lagrangian approach for non - sm couplings of fermions to gauge bosons , and then examine the effects of a prototypical class of theories ( topcolor ) where the dynamical generation of fermion masses imply the existence of relatively light new states .",
    "the effects of new dynamics on the couplings of fermions with the sm gauge bosons can be , in principle , also studied in an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "for instance , if in analogy with the situation in qcd , fermion masses are dynamically generated in association with ewsb , residual interactions of fermions with goldstone bosons could be important  @xcite if the @xmath105 .",
    "thus residual , non - universal interactions of the third generation quarks with gauge bosons could carry interesting information about both the origin of the top quark mass and ewsb . in a very general parameterization",
    ", the anomalous couplings of third generation quarks can be written as @xmath106 where the parameters @xmath107 , @xmath108 contain the residual , non - universal effects associated with the new dynamics , perhaps responsible for the large top quark mass . then ,",
    "if we assume that the new couplings are cp conserving , there are six new parameters .",
    "they are constrained at low energies by a variety of experimental information , mostly from electroweak precision measurements and the rate of @xmath72 .",
    "several simplifications are usually made in order to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "for instance , in most of the literature , it is assumed that @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "a stringent bound on the right - handed charged coupling is obtained from @xmath72  @xcite : @xmath110 .",
    "the bounds obtained on a particular coupling from electroweak observables such as @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath26 and @xmath52 generally strongly depend on assumptions about the other couplings .",
    "for example , if @xmath111 , then the combination @xmath112 is strongly constrained since it contributes to @xmath20 . on the other hand , if @xmath113 , then @xmath114  @xcite since it is the only ( linear ) contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , although in general most parameters are confined to a few percent , some of them are allowed to be as large as @xmath115 under certain conditions .",
    "this `` model - dependent '' situation requires more experimental information . a global analysis of the effects of the couplings of eqn .",
    "( [ lfer ] ) in rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 processes such as @xmath103 , @xmath65 , etc . may help disentangle the various possible effects and perhaps will give constraints that may be of importance in interpreting data from higher energy experiments  @xcite .",
    "the description of the residual effects of strong dynamics at low energies on fermion couplings by using ( [ lfer ] ) corresponds to cases where the states associated with the new physics are heavy compared to the weak scale .",
    "thus , integrating out the heavy states , leaves us with effective couplings which might be generated at tree level or through loops in the full theory .",
    "however , most theories in which electroweak symmetry and/or fermion masses have a dynamical origin also contain states with masses comparable to the weak scale .",
    "such is the case , for instance , in technicolor models where the breaking of large chiral symmetries imply the presence of pseudo - goldstone bosons with masses of at most a few hundred gev .",
    "it is also the case in topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tatc ) models  @xcite , where a top - condensation mechanism generated by the topcolor interactions is responsible for the large dynamical top quark mass , whereas technicolor breaks the electroweak symmetry giving ( most of ) the @xmath116 and @xmath61 masses .",
    "the tatc scenario is designed to relief the problems of extended technicolor ( etc ) in generating a heavy top  @xcite .",
    "although the new gauge bosons associated with the tatc gauge group are heavier than @xmath117tev , the presence of several scalar and pseudo - scalar states with masses in the few - hundred  gev range , forces us to take these into account directly in our calculations . from the point of view of their impact in low energy observables ,",
    "the most important of these states are the top - pions @xmath118 , the triplet of goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of the top chiral symmetry .",
    "since top condensation does not fully break the electroweak symmetry ( @xmath119 ) , after mixing with the techni - pions , there will be a triplet of physical top - pions in the spectrum , with a coupling to third generation quarks given by @xmath120 they acquire masses of a few hundred gev due to explicit etc quark mass terms .",
    "additionally , in most models there are scalar and pseudo - scalar bound states due to the strong ( although sub - critical ) effective coupling of right - handed @xmath121-quarks .",
    "the closer the effective couplings are from criticality , the lighter these bound states tend to be .",
    "the spectrum and properties of these states , unlike those of top - pions , are not determined by model - independent features of the symmetry breaking pattern but depend on details of the model .",
    "finally , in all tatc models there will be pseudo - goldstone bosons from the breaking of techni - fermion chiral symmetries .",
    "however , their couplings to third generation quarks are reduced with respect to ( [ tpcop ] ) by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a small etc mass of the order of @xmath117gev .",
    "the presence of the relatively light top - pions , as well as the additional bound states , imposes severe constraints on topcolor models due to their potential loop effects in low energy observables , most notably @xmath52 and rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays .",
    "[ [ top - pion - effects - in - r_b ] ] top - pion effects in @xmath52 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    :   the one - loop contributions of top - pions to the @xmath124 process were studied in ref .",
    "there it was shown that they shift @xmath52 negatively by an amount controlled by @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath127gev the correction is about @xmath128 for @xmath129gev , and top - pions with masses in the expected @xmath130gev range give unacceptably large deviations .",
    "this value of the top - pion decay constant is obtained by using the pagels - stokar formula , which gives @xmath126 a logarithmic dependence on the topcolor energy scale , chosen here to be a few tev .",
    "potentially cancelling contributions by other states , such as the scalar and pseudo - scalar bound states , topcolor vector and axial - vector mesons , etc .",
    ", are either of the wrong sign or not large enough",
    ". possible ways out of this constraint are : larger top - pion masses or larger values of @xmath126 .",
    "the larger @xmath126 is , the smaller the coupling , and the top - pions are more goldstone - boson - like . for @xmath131gev , for instance , the shift of @xmath52 is well within the experimentally allowed region even for @xmath132gev .",
    "however , in order to obtain such an enhancement in the decay constant we must either assume large corrections to the pagels - stokar expression or introduce new and exotic fermion states .",
    "[ [ rare - b - and - k - decays ] ] rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    :   the top - pions and other scalar states , give one - loop contributions to fcnc processes .",
    "these depend not only on @xmath126 and @xmath125 but typically also on one or more elements of the quark rotation matrices necessary to diagonalize the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "the contributions of top - pions , as well as `` b - pions '' ( scalar and pseudo - scalar bound states in models where @xmath133 couples to the topcolor interaction ) to @xmath72 depend on @xmath134 , the @xmath135 element in the left or right down rotation matrix .",
    "furthermore , the two contributions tend to cancel .",
    "thus , the freedom in this model - dependent aspects of the prediction makes it possible to have quite low masses and still satisfy the bound from the experimental measurement of @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes drastically in @xmath103 processes , where the cancellations are much less efficient .",
    "although experiments have not yet reached sensitivity to sm branching ratios  @xcite , it will be soon achieved at both hadron and lepton @xmath5 factories .",
    "as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "3 the br@xmath136 as a function of the top - pion mass with no other contributions , for @xmath137gev .",
    "the @xmath72 constraint is in this case @xmath138 .",
    "however , one can see that , even for heavier top - pions the effect can still be a @xmath139 enhancement over the sm prediction of @xmath140 . on the other hand , in the presence of a @xmath141gev charged b - pion the curve changes little , but the @xmath72 bound is now @xmath142 . finally , to compare the potential of these fcnc transitions with the @xmath52 constraints , let us say that if we take @xmath131gev ( which avoids conflict with @xmath52 measurements ) , then the effect of a @xmath141gev top - pion in @xmath103 is still an enhancement of more than @xmath143 with respect to sm expectations .",
    "thus , the observation of these modes will further constrain topcolor models beyond the @xmath52 bounds .",
    "we expect similar effects due to top - pions and/or b - pions to be present in kaon processes such as @xmath73 .",
    "we have seen that a complete , model - independent analysis of the effects of strong dynamics in rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays could shed light on the nature of the ewsb mechanism and the origin of fermion masses .",
    "the signals are also likely to be important in models where relatively light scalars couple strongly to mass , like in the case of tatc . in most cases",
    ", the next round of experiments will have sensitivity to sm branching ratios .",
    "this will be the case , for instance , for the tevatron experiments , as well the kek and slac @xmath5 factories in the @xmath144 modes .",
    "it will also be the situation in the next generation of kaon experiments for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the amount and variety of experimental information from these processes is such that suggests a parallel to the role of electroweak measurements at the @xmath61 pole as not only a constraint on new physics sources but also as guidance in the searches to be carried out at high energy machines such as the tevatron in run  ii , the lhc and eventually the nlc and/or the muon collider .",
    "it is possible to imagine a scenario where deviations from the sm in @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 decays point to a particular source , e.g. corrections to goldstone boson propagators given by @xmath32 , anomalous tgc or anomalous couplings of third generation quarks to gauge bosons as in ( [ lfer ] ) .",
    "the nature of the deviation might dictate the road to follow at high energies .",
    "as an example , if the source of an effect is in one the top quark couplings @xmath145 , there would be a strong case for a lepton collider running at @xmath146 threshold .",
    "other scenarios may not be so clear , and may require a comprehensive and careful analysis of all the data to come ( including issues like hadronic uncertainties in @xmath5 decays ) .",

    "<S> we focus on models involving new strong dynamics and show that transitions involving flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) play an important role in disentangling the physics in these scenarios . in a model - independent approach to the ewsb sector , the information from rare decays is complementary to precision electroweak observables in bounding the contributions to the effective lagrangian . we compare the pattern of deviations from the standard model ( sm ) that results from these sources , with the deviations associated with the mechanism for generating fermion masses .    madph-98 - 1039 + </S>"
