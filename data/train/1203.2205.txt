    "in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the signal of interest @xmath2 represents the magnetization induced by resonance in the imaged tissues . in the standard setting , data acquired in mri provide complete fourier , or @xmath1-space , measurements of this signal @xmath2 . accelerating the acquisition process , or equivalently increasing the achievable resolution for a fixed acquisition time , is of major interest for mri applications .",
    "recent approaches based on compressed sensing seek to reconstruct the signal from incomplete @xmath1-space information , hence defining an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "the ill - posed inverse problem is regularized by the introduction of sparsity priors , acknowledging the fact that many mri signals are sparse in well - chosen bases ; i.e. , that their expansion contains only a small number of non - zero coefficients .",
    "such compressed sensing techniques have been developed for static and dynamic imaging @xcite , parallel mri @xcite , mr spectroscopic imaging @xcite , and many other applications .",
    "several algorithms have also been proposed to reconstruct mri signals from under - sampled @xmath1-space measurements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the framework of compressed sensing ,",
    "signals are usually measured through random matrices to ensure that any sparse signal can be recovered with overwhelming probability . the common approach in mri consists in also exploiting the fact that the energy of mri signals is usually concentrated at low spatial frequencies .",
    "therefore a variable density @xmath1-space random sampling where the under - sampling ratio increases at high frequencies is usually used @xcite .",
    "this method , heuristic in nature , was shown to be very effective in enhancing the signal reconstruction quality when random distributions optimizing the associated point spread function are used .",
    "other approaches that optimize the acquisition procedure have also been proposed : @xmath1-space sampling optimization by bayesian inference @xcite ; random @xmath1-space convolution with toeplitz matrices @xcite ; encoding by projection onto random waveforms with gaussian distributions @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose the use of a spread spectrum technique to accelerate single coil mri acquisition in the framework of compressed sensing .",
    "we study this method , coined spread spectrum mri or simply s@xmath0mri , theoretically , numerically via simulations , and empirically via real acquisitions .",
    "the essence of our strategy consists of pre - modulating the image by a linear chirp , which results from the application of quadratic phase profiles , and then performing random @xmath1-space under - sampling .",
    "images are then reconstructed with non - linear algorithms promoting signal sparsity .",
    "the enhancement of the signal reconstruction quality is linked to a decrease of coherence of the measurement system @xcite . in mri , this type of modulation is known as phase scrambling .",
    "it can be obtained by using dedicated coils or by modifying radio frequency ( rf ) pulses .",
    "it has been used for various purposes , such as improving dynamic range @xcite , or reducing aliasing artifacts @xcite , but never in a compressed sensing perspective .",
    "let us acknowledge that this spread spectrum technique was initially introduced by some of the authors for compressive sampling of pulse trains in @xcite .",
    "its transfer to a setting encompassing analog signals and modulations was studied in the context of radio interferometry @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the method for mri was briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spread spectrum principle ] , we explain the principle of the spread spectrum technique in a simplified analog setting . in section",
    "[ sec : mr measurements ] , we formulate the inverse problem for image reconstruction from under - sampled @xmath3-space measurements in the presence of chirp modulation and compare the s@xmath0mri technique to the variable density sampling method on the basis of numerical simulations of mr acquisitions of a brain image . in section [ sec : real acquisitions ] , we describe our implementation of the chirp modulation ( on a @xmath4 t scanner ) and show the effectiveness of s@xmath0mri using numerical simulations in this precise setting and real acquisitions of phantom and _ in vivo _ data .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss potential evolutions of the technique in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the essence of the recent theory of compressed sensing is the merging of data acquisition and compression @xcite . beyond mri ,",
    "it is well - known that a large variety of natural signals are sparse or compressible in multi - scale bases , such as wavelet bases . in the compressed sensing",
    "theory , signals are usually expressed as @xmath5-dimensional vectors : @xmath6 . by definition ,",
    "a signal is sparse in some orthonormal basis @xmath7 , called a sparsity basis , if its expansion contains only a small number @xmath8 of non - zero coefficients .",
    "more generally it is compressible if its expansion contains only a small number of significant coefficients .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath9 in @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 , and it satisfies @xmath12 the theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that a small number @xmath13 of linear and non - adaptative measurements @xmath14 suffices for an accurate and stable reconstruction of the signal @xmath9 .",
    "these measurements may , for example , be obtained by projection onto @xmath15 randomly selected basis vectors of an orthonormal basis @xmath16 , called a sensing basis .",
    "this selection process can be modeled by a multiplication with a rectangular binary matrix @xmath17 that contains only one non - zero value on each line , at the index of the basis vector to be selected . to model a non - perfect sensing process ,",
    "these measurements are assumed to be contaminated by independent and identically distributed noise @xmath18 .",
    "the measurement model thus satisfies @xmath19 where the matrix @xmath20 identifies the measurement matrix as seen from the sparsity basis ( @xmath21 denotes the conjugate transpose operation ) .    to reconstruct the signal @xmath9 from the measurements @xmath22 , the compressed sensing framework proposes , among other approaches , to solve the basis pursuit ( @xmath23 ) minimization problem @xcite",
    "this problem regularizes the originally ill - posed inverse problem related to ( [ cs2 ] ) with an explicit sparsity or compressibility prior on the signal . in the presence of noise , the @xmath23 problem is the minimization of the @xmath24 norm where @xmath25 is the @xmath26th entry of the vector @xmath27 .",

    "the compressed sensing theory shows that if the number of measurements satisfies @xmath34 for a universal constant @xmath35 , then @xmath27 is recovered accurately by solving the @xmath36 problem ( [ cs3 ] ) @xcite . in relation ( [ cs5 ] ) , @xmath37 is the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases .",
    "it is defined as the maximum projection , in absolute value , between the sparsity basis vectors @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and sensing bases vectors @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42     spread spectrum principle . a signal @xmath9 ( top left panel ) is modulated by a linear chirp ( top right panel ) . in @xmath1-space ,",
    "the modulation amounts to the convolution of the fourier transform of the signal ( middle left panel ) with that of the chirp ( middle right panel ) .",
    "the spectrum of the resulting signal ( bottom panel ) spreads out in @xmath1-space.,width=264,height=377 ]    the mutual coherence @xmath37 plays a crucial role in relation ( [ cs5 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the number of measurements @xmath43 needed to reconstruct @xmath44-sparse signals increases quadratically with its value : @xmath45 . in the worst case",
    "where @xmath46 , @xmath43 is of the order of the signal dimension @xmath5 and under - sampling is impossible .",
    "however , when the mutual coherence is at its minimum , @xmath47 , @xmath43 is reduced to the order of the sparsity level @xmath44 .",
    "this result can intuitively be explained with a simple consideration on the spread of the energy of the sparsity basis vectors in the measurement domain @xmath48 . in an incoherent orthonormal system ,",
    "the absolute value of the scalar product between the sensing basis vector @xmath38 and the sparsity basis vector @xmath40 is small for all pairs of indices @xmath49 . as @xmath50 , the energy of the sparsity basis vector @xmath40 spreads equally over the sensing basis vectors @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , whatever index @xmath26 is selected to perform a measurement , one always gets information concerning all the sparsity basis vectors describing the original signal .",
    "the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery thus decreases .",
    ".[tab : table nmu ] values of @xmath51 at different chirp rates @xmath52 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above considerations suggest that to reduce to the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of mri signals , one can try to modify the mri acquisition procedure in such a way that the energy of the sparsity basis vectors spreads all over the @xmath1-space .",
    "following this idea , the s@xmath0mri technique introduces a linear chirp modulation of the signal of interest before random selection of @xmath1-space coefficients ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ssp principle ] ) .",
    "indeed , this modulation conserves the energy of the input signal and corresponds to a convolution that generically spreads the spectrum .    to study theoretically the proposed acquisition scheme",
    ", we consider a simplified analog setting where the one - dimensional signal of interest is denoted by a complex - valued function @xmath53 of the position @xmath54 .",
    "this signal is limited on a finite field of view @xmath55 . for the sake of simplicity of the following theoretical result only",
    ", we assume that the energy of this signal beyond the spatial frequency @xmath56 is negligible , we will introduce a setting that properly takes into account the fact that , in general , mri signals are not band limited . ] .",
    "we thus sample this signal on a discrete uniform grid of @xmath57 points and represent the resulting discrete signal by a vector @xmath58 .",
    "the vector @xmath9 is assumed to be @xmath44-sparse in an orthonormal basis @xmath59 .",
    "we also consider a one - dimensional linear chirp , with chirp rate @xmath60 , that reads as a complex - valued function @xmath61 . on the field of view",
    "@xmath55 , this linear chirp is approximately band limited at its maximum instantaneous frequency @xmath62 .",
    "this band limit can be parametrized in terms of a discrete chirp rate @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 .    in this",
    "setting , the s@xmath0mri measurement model is given by equation ( [ cs2 ] ) with @xmath65 in the above equation , the matrix @xmath66 represents an up - sampling operator needed to avoid aliasing of the modulated signal due to a lack of sampling resolution in a digital description of the originally analog problem .",
    "indeed , the convolution in fourier space induced by the analog chirp modulation implies that the band limit of the modulated signal is the sum of the individual band limits of the original signal and of the chirp @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , an up - sampled grid with at least @xmath68 points needs to be considered and the modulated signal is correctly obtained by applying the chirp modulation on the signal after up - sampling on the @xmath69 points grid .",
    "the up - sampling operator @xmath66 , implemented in fourier space by zero padding , is thus of size @xmath70 and satisfies @xmath71 .",
    "the matrix @xmath72 is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation on the up - sampled grid and the matrix @xmath73 stands for the discrete fourier basis on the same grid .",
    "the s@xmath0mri sensing matrix @xmath48 is not orthogonal because of the presence of the matrix @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the recovery condition ( [ cs5 ] ) does not strictly hold .",
    "however , one can obtain a similar recovery condition @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath74 for some universal constant @xmath35 , then the vector @xmath9 is accurately recovered with high probability by solving the @xmath36 problem ( [ cs3 ] ) .",
    "this result shows that the number of measurements @xmath15 needed to reconstruct @xmath44-sparse signals is proportional to the product @xmath75 rather than to @xmath76 only .",
    "the s@xmath0mri technique is efficient only if this product decreases with the chirp rate @xmath52 . in other words ,",
    "the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of sparse signals decreases only for sparsity basis @xmath10 for which the mutual coherence @xmath77 decreases faster than @xmath69 increases .",
    "probability of recovery of the signal @xmath9 as a function of the number of measurements @xmath15 for @xmath78 ( dotted black curve ) , @xmath79 ( continuous blue curve ) , @xmath80 ( continuous red curve ) , @xmath81 ( continuous black curve ) , and three sparsity bases : the dirac basis ( left ) ; the haar wavelet basis ( middle ) ; the fourier basis ( right).,width=347 ]    we illustrate here the effect of the chirp modulation on the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of @xmath44-sparse signals .",
    "we consider a @xmath82-dimensional complex signal @xmath9 of size @xmath83 corresponding to one line of an mri brain image .",
    "this signal is decomposed into three different sparsity bases @xmath10 and hard - thresholded at a fixed sparsity @xmath84 .",
    "the sparsity bases considered are the dirac basis , the haar wavelet basis and the fourier basis .",
    "this signal is then probed according to relation ( [ cs2 ] ) with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and reconstructed from different numbers of measurements @xmath15 by solving the @xmath87 problem ( [ cs3 ] ) .",
    "each time , the probability of recovery - norm between the original signal @xmath9 and the reconstructed signal @xmath88 satisfies : @xmath89 of the signal is computed over @xmath90 simulations . in this experiment ,",
    "no noise is added to the measurements @xmath91 , and the indices @xmath26 of the selected fourier basis vectors @xmath92 are chosen uniformly at random from @xmath93 .    the @xmath23 reconstructions in the presence of chirp modulation with chirp rate @xmath52 are denoted by @xmath94 . for each sparsity basis and chirp rate",
    "considered , the curves of the probability of recovery as a function of the number of measurements @xmath15 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ssp ] .",
    "the corresponding values of the product @xmath95 are reported in table [ tab : table nmu ] .",
    "for the dirac basis , the number of measurements needed to reach a probability of recovery of @xmath82 slightly increases with the chirp rate , as suggested by the values of @xmath95 in table [ tab : table nmu ] and relation ( [ eq : analog recovery ] ) . on the contrary , for the haar and fourier bases , the values of @xmath95 in the table predict a drastic improvement of the results with an increase of the chirp rate .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ssp ] . note that for the haar and fourier bases , the value of the product @xmath95 decreases much less between @xmath96 and @xmath97 than between @xmath98 and @xmath96 , suggesting a smaller improvement in the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery .",
    "this is also in line with the curves of the probability of recovery in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ssp ] . in summary , as predicted by the theory , the effect of the s@xmath0mri technique depends on the sparsity basis .",
    "note that the decrease of the performance for the dirac basis ( optimally incoherent only at @xmath99 ) is negligible compared to the improvement obtained for the two other bases .",
    "note also that mri signals are usually sparse in wavelet bases @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with the haar wavelet basis therefore suggest strong efficiency of the technique in mri .",
    "one can wonder if the proposed encoding scheme can result in shift - variant reconstruction quality .",
    "indeed , the phase variation at the center of the chirp is less rapid than at the limit of the field of view .",
    "let us consider the case of a signal sparse in the haar wavelet basis .",
    "this signal can , roughly , be separated in large scale and fine scale sparsity basis vectors .",
    "the region where the chirp is oscillating slowly is limited to a small part of the field of view .",
    "consequently , large scale sparsity basis vectors are necessarily affected by the chirp modulation as they have a wide support in signal space .",
    "the energy of these basis vectors is thus spread in @xmath1-space thus improving the reconstruction quality of the low scale structures of the signal . on the other hand , the fine scale sparsity basis vectors at the center of the field of view remains not significantly modulated .",
    "however , these vectors are already incoherent with the fourier basis as their energy naturally spreads out in @xmath1-space .",
    "the fine scale structure of the signal are well recovered in absence and presence of chirp modulation . in summary ,",
    "almost no shift - variant reconstruction quality is to be expected .",
    "let us acknowledge that the idea of convolving the @xmath3-space to optimize the acquisition procedure in the context of compressed sensing can also be found in @xcite . in these works , the @xmath1-space is convolved by a random toeplitz matrices .",
    "we should also note that the spread spectrum technique can be related to the random convolution approach where the signal is convolved by a random sequence and under - sampled in _ real space _",
    "@xcite . in our case ,",
    "convolution and under - sampling occur in _",
    "@xmath3-space_. finally , let us mention that in a discrete setting , i.e. , in the absence of band limit extension , replacing the linear chirp modulation by a random modulation leads to a universal encoding strategy , i.e. , the reconstruction quality does not depend on the sparsity basis @xcite .",
    "the s@xmath0mri technique tries to emulate this universal encoding strategy .",
    "a universal compressed sensing strategy might as well be obtained by projecting the signal @xmath9 onto random waveforms with gaussian distributions @xcite . in the context of mri , an encoding strategy based on this sensing scheme was recently proposed in @xcite .",

    "moreover , fitting the effective chirp center and rates on the basis of the data could improve the measurement model and result in better reconstructions .",
    "let us also emphasize the potential interest of the s@xmath0mri technique from an enhanced resolution perspective as , in the presence of the chirp modulation , the original image is reconstructed at a high resolution in order to avoid any aliasing problems .",
