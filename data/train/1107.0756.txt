    "in an earlier paper @xcite we proposed an interference experiment with outcomes sensitive to the value of the theta angle in qed .",
    "as depicted in figure 1 , a combination of mirrors and beam splitters produces a superposition of two photonic states , which are then recombined to produce an interference pattern .",
    "the relative phase between the two states is equal to theta times the integral over @xmath0 , which is meant to be non - zero for the upper path ( on which the photon packet passes through a background field , or encounters another photon packet ) and zero for the lower path .",
    "this result can be deduced in two ways , either by considering a functional integral , or by solving the functional schrodinger equation in qed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the former case ,",
    "we use @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time evolution operator in the presence of a theta term . in the latter case",
    ", we note that the theta term does not alter the qed hamiltonian , but does shift the canonical momentum by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic field .",
    "solutions to the schrodinger equation in the presence of @xmath5 can be related to @xmath6 solutions as follows @xmath7 ~=~ \\exp \\left (    i \\theta \\int d^3x \\ , { a \\cdot b \\over 2 } \\right ) \\psi_{\\theta = 0 } [ a ] ~~.\\ ] ] we recall that the current @xmath8 has divergence @xmath9 , so the spacetime integral over @xmath10 can be re - expressed in terms the difference between spatial integrals at early and late times : @xmath11 ~ \\equiv ~ 8 \\pi^2 \\bigg [ h(a_f ) - h(a_i ) \\bigg].\\ ] ] note we work in minkowski space and restrict ourselves to configurations where the integral of @xmath12 at spatial infinity ( @xmath13 ) can be neglected .",
    "@xmath14 is the same density that appears in the exponent in ( [ psiphase ] ) .",
    "its integral over space is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnetic helicity ( or abelian chern - simons number ) @xcite of @xmath17 , which counts the linking number of magnetic field lines .",
    "is non - zero in the interaction region .",
    "could interference between the recombined packets depend on the parameter @xmath5?,width=377 ]    contrary to the author s expectations in the earlier paper @xcite , it is difficult to obtain a non - zero integral of @xmath10 in a laboratory setting . using ( [ eb ] ) , we see that it is necessary that the magnetic helicity be different at early and late times .",
    "typical configurations produced by , e.g. , lasers or atomic transitions , have zero magnetic helicity .",
    "we can reach a similar conclusion via a slightly different argument : consider any configuration that can be expressed in terms of a sum of waveforms : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the direction of propagation , @xmath20 are the perpendicular coordinates , and the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are assumed to be localized .",
    "since photons do not interact classically , these waveforms propagate undisturbed and become widely separated at early and late times .",
    "the magnetic helicity , which is the integral over all space of @xmath23 , decomposes into integrals over widely separated regions , each of which yields the same result at early and late times due to the form of the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the same is true if we consider wavepackets which pass through a static background field .",
    "thus , it seems quite challenging to produce , in a real experiment , an effect which is sensitive to theta .    in what follows",
    "we describe specific gauge configurations whose quantum interference does depend on theta .",
    "these configurations are necessarily non - perturbative , with potentials that fall off only as @xmath24 in some non - zero solid angle .",
    "they presumably only lead to exponentially small effects in qed , although their existence is evidence that the theta angle does have physical consequences .",
    "in the usual analysis of gauge theories potentials are required to fall off faster than @xmath24 .",
    "however , there does not seem to be any strong justification for this other than convenience ",
    "i.e. , such configurations are amenable to topological classification .",
    "we relax this condition , and investigate configurations with the following properties .    1 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath4 falls off as @xmath25 or faster at large @xmath26 2 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath27 is zero everywhere ( no monopoles ) 3 .",
    "they can be smoothly deformed into nearby configurations with faster ( e.g. , @xmath28 ) fall off , and also to the vacuum @xmath29 , without passing through configurations with infinite energy .    in euclidean space configurations with",
    "@xmath30 have infinite action , since the contribution to the action from @xmath31 diverges .",
    "however , there does not seem to be any good reason to exclude such configurations in minkowski space @xcite .",
    "indeed , exact solutions with @xmath24 behavior are known in @xmath32 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we make use of @xmath33 configurations constructed by jackiw and pi @xcite by projecting su(2 ) vacuum gauge fields ( given by spatially varying group elements @xmath34 su(2 ) ) onto a fixed ( @xmath35 electromagnetic ) direction in isospin space .",

    "the magnetic helicities of the two differ by [ hg ] h = h(a_f ) - h(a_f ) = d^3x   _ i b^i = d_i  b^i  , where @xmath44 is the surface at spatial infinity .",

    "in @xcite it was shown explicitly that configurations given in ( [ jp1 ] ) with @xmath48 non - integer have magnetic helicities which are not gauge invariant .",
    "for example , if one transforms to the coulomb gauge , so that potentials in ( [ jp1 ] ) are transverse , the magnetic helicity is modified as follows h ( a^t ) = h(a ) + ( 1 - f ) f |_r =  . as expected from equation ( [ hg ] ) , @xmath16 is not necessarily gauge invariant when the magnetic fields fall off only as @xmath25 , which in this case corresponds to @xmath49 non - zero .",

    "@xmath54 is simply a path parameter and need not be the time coordinate .",

    "joining the two paths together , we obtain a closed loop in configuration space , modulo a gauge transformation at @xmath57 .",

    "note that at intermediate times @xmath62 the two configurations @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not related by a gauge transformation , even though @xmath63 . for example , @xmath64 , whereas @xmath65 , so at intermediate times the @xmath66 fields of the two interpolations are not identical .",
    "we take @xmath67 to approach zero at early and late times .",
    "if the region where @xmath67 is non - zero has timelike extent @xmath68 , then ( assuming , e.g. , @xmath59 linear in @xmath54 ) the energy density at large @xmath26 from the electric fields is @xmath69 . if the timelike extent is taken to infinity appropriately ( e.g. , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the spacelike extent ) then all of the interpolating configurations will have finite energy .",
    "it is easy to check that there is no flow of topological charge through the surface at spatial infinity : @xmath62 and @xmath72 .",
    "the chern - simons current flowing through this surface is given by _",
    "0^dt   r^2 d   k^r = _ 0^dt  r^2 d  since the temporal component @xmath73 these are the only terms that contribute to @xmath74 ;",
    "the first and third indices of the epsilon tensor are fixed to be @xmath26 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath75 only acts on @xmath59 , so the form of the integrand above is ( the lower case @xmath76 denote jackiw - pi configurations @xmath77 ) : g(t ) a_(x ) g(t ) a_(x )   -   g(t ) a_(x ) g(t ) a_(x )  =   0  .",
    "thus , no net current flows through the timelike surface at @xmath78 .",

    "this difference in helicities is not quantized .",
    "because the difference in helicities @xmath80 is not quantized , the physical effects of theta are not @xmath81 periodic .",
    "this is surprising because of , e.g. , the following argument : in the presence of fermions we can use the anomaly relation to rotate theta onto the fermion mass matrix ; because a @xmath81 shift in the phase of a fermion mass leaves the mass invariant , physics should therefore be @xmath81 periodic in theta .",
    "how is this apparent contradiction resolved ?    a careful derivation @xcite of the anomaly equation in the presence of general background gauge fields @xmath82 ( i.e. , including those which approach zero as @xmath24 asymptotically ) yields a correction to the usual expression : [ anomaly ] _ j^= 1 16 ^2 f  -   j ( a )  .",
    "although we have written @xmath83 on the right hand side of the equation , it arises due to proper regularization of the fermion current @xmath84 . when the background @xmath17 has strong asymptotic behavior the @xmath29 subtraction used to regularize @xmath85 leaves a residual defined here as @xmath83 .",
    "note that d^4x   j  =   1 2 ( 0 )  =   1 2 ( 0 ) |^t = _ t = 0 so the spacetime integral of the anomaly equation ( [ anomaly ] ) yields the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem [ aps ] n_+ - n_- = d^4x  _ j^= 1 16 ^2 d^4x   f - 1 2 ( 0 )  . here",
    "@xmath86 is the change in the `` @xmath87-invariant '' @xcite ( s ) = _ 0   , defined in terms of eigenvalues @xmath88 of the dirac operator , and @xmath89 counts the level crossings ( spectral flow ) of these eigenvalues . for gauge configurations which interpolate between vacua ( or which approach vacua sufficiently rapidly at early and late times ) , @xmath90 , because the eigenvalues at early and late times are identical .",
    "however , for configurations such as ours , with @xmath30 behavior , @xmath91 does not vanish , because the eigenvalues of the dirac operator do not approach their vacuum values as @xmath92 .",
    "the left hand side of the aps theorem ( [ aps ] ) is an integer , whereas in our case both terms on the right hand side can take on fractional values . in the presence of such configurations , the effects of theta",
    "can not simply be rotated into the fermion mass matrix .    to demonstrate the equivalence of a phase @xmath93 in the fermion mass ( assume for simplicity a single flavor ) to the effect of a theta term , one makes a chiral rotation of the fermion fields , which cancels @xmath93 in the mass term , but shifts the action by s = d^4x   = d^4x  _ j^= ( n_+ - n_- )  .",
    "this shift is periodic under @xmath94 because @xmath89 is an integer .",
    "however , we see from the index theorem ( [ aps ] ) or the anomaly equation ( [ anomaly ] ) that the effect on the action from this chiral rotation is _ not _ equivalent to a shift in the theta term if the background field @xmath17 is one for which the eta invariant is non - zero : [ ds ] s = d^4x   . in background fields ( such as those with @xmath24 behavior ) for which the last term in ( [ ds ] ) is non - zero , a chiral rotation is not equivalent to a shift in theta ",
    "i.e. , to a shift in the coefficient of @xmath95 only .",
    "while the physical effects due to a phase @xmath93 in the fermion mass are invariant under @xmath94 , the effects due to theta are not periodic , because neither the magnetic helicity nor changes in the magnetic helicity are quantized ; both terms multiplying @xmath93 in ( [ ds ] ) can take on fractional or irrational values . in the presence of generic gauge backgrounds with @xmath24 behavior",
    "the theta term can not be rotated away in favor of a phase in the fermion mass matrix .",
    "we described an interference effect in qed which is sensitive to the theta angle .",
    "however , this effect required fields with @xmath30 or @xmath96 behavior , which are non - perturbative and hence presumably only lead to exponentially small effects ( e.g. , of order @xmath97 ) . in order to be explicit",
    "we used the example of the jackiw - pi configurations ( [ jp1 ] ) , but it is easy to construct other examples  the key requirement is simply that the magnetic field have sufficiently strong asymptotic behavior .",
    "if this asymptotic behavior is allowed , then these paths occur in the functional integral and their relative phase depends on theta .",
    "note that these configurations do not exhibit monopole magnetic charges ; all magnetic field lines form closed loops .    whether theta has physical consequences depends crucially on the boundary conditions imposed on the gauge fields .",
    "this is not surprising , as @xmath98 is a total derivative and the theta term can be rewritten as an integral over the boundary of spacetime .",
    "however , the situation is quite different from ordinary dynamics in quantum field theory , which usually does not depend on the choice of boundary conditions once the volume is taken to infinity ( special cases such as symmetry breaking excepted ) .    now consider pure gauge configurations in ( 3 + 1 ) qcd : @xmath99 .",
    "if the gauge function @xmath100 approaches a constant matrix , then these configurations can be classified topologically ( @xmath101 maps @xmath102 su(3)@xmath103 ) and have potentials @xmath17 that fall off faster than @xmath24",
    ". however , the condition that @xmath100 approach a constant matrix privileges a particular position in space , and seems inconsistent with translation invariance ( although the invariance is approximately good far from the boundary ) .",
    "instead , we can build a translation - invariant state by superposing configurations where @xmath101 is allowed to vary , even as @xmath104 .",
    "for such configurations , winding numbers and topological charges can be fractional , and physics is no longer periodic in theta .",
    "as in the discussion of the previous section , the physical effects of the theta term are then _ not _ equivalent to those of a phase in the quark mass matrix , which only captures the effects of fluctuations that lead to actual level crossing : integer @xmath89 .",
    "this observation calls into question the usual calculation relating the neutron electric dipole moment and theta , which proceeds by rotating the theta angle onto the quark masses , and then uses the chiral lagrangian .    while we do not expect the ordinary dynamics of qcd to depend on choice of boundary conditions at infinity",
    ", it seems that theta effects ( such as , but not limited to , strong cp violation ) are sensitive to whether one imposes integer or fractional topological charge .",
    "for example , suppose the topological charge @xmath105 is not quantized , and hence theta is not a compact variable .",
    "the vacuum energy density @xmath106 can be computed using the euclidean path integral [ rl ] z = ( - v ( ) )  =   da   ( - d^4x   1 4 f^2 + i 16 ^2 q )   _ 0^ dq  ( q )   2 ( 16 ^2 q )  .",
    "the reimann - lebesgue lemma implies that the integral above vanishes monotonically as @xmath107 , which implies that the energy density @xmath106 is not periodic in theta , but rather increases monotonically .",
    "it seems possible that at large enough theta phase oscillations suppress sectors with @xmath108 , rendering qcd nearly cp conserving .    1.0 cm * acknowledgments*@xmath103 the author thanks sean carroll and mark wise for useful discussions .",
