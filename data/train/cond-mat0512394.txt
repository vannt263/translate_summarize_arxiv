    "<S> a different approach to experimentally study the physics of efimov states is based on the unique properties of ultracold atomic quantum gases . </S>",
    "<S> such systems@xcite facilitate an unprecedented level of control to study interacting quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the ultra - low collision energies allow to explore the zero - energy quantum limit . </S>",

    "<S> [ efimov ] ) is given by the three - atom threshold ( @xmath11 ) for negative @xmath0 and by the dimer - atom threshold ( @xmath9 ) for positive @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> energy states below the continuum threshold are necessarily three - body bound states . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 approaches the resonance from the negative-@xmath0 side , a first efimov trimer state appears in a range where a weakly bound two - body state does not exist . when passing through the resonance the state connects to the positive-@xmath0 side , where it finally intersects with the dimer - atom threshold . </S>",
    "<S> an infinite series of such efimov states is found when scattering lengths and energies are increased in powers of universal scaling factors@xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> another type of efimov resonances@xcite is found at positive values of @xmath0 for collisions between a free atom and a dimer , when efimov states intersect with the dimer - atom threshold . while the latter type of efimov resonances corresponds to feshbach resonances in collisions between atoms and dimers@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> triatomic efimov resonances can be interpreted as a three - body generalization to feshbach resonances@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> striking manifestations of efimov physics have been predicted for three - body recombination processes in ultracold gases with tunable two - body interactions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three - body recombination leads to losses from a trapped gas with a rate proportional to the third power of the atomic number density . </S>",
    "<S> these losses are commonly described@xcite in terms of a loss rate coefficient @xmath15 . in the resonant case ( @xmath16 ) , it is convenient to express this coefficient in the form @xmath17 , separating a general @xmath18-scaling@xcite from an additional dependence@xcite @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> efimov physics is reflected in a logarithmically periodic behavior @xmath20 , corresponding to the scaling of the infinite series of weakly bound trimer states </S>",
    "<S> . for negative scattering lengths , the resonant coupling of three atoms to an efimov state opens up fast decay channels into deeply bound dimer states plus a free atom . </S>",
    "<S> triatomic efimov resonances thus show up in giant recombination loss . </S>",
    "<S> this striking phenomenon was first identified in numerical solutions to the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation of the three - body schrdinger equation assuming simple model potentials and interpreted in terms of tunneling through a potential barrier in the three - body entrance channel@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the free parameter @xmath22 for the resonance positions at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 depends on the short - range part of the three - body interaction and is thus not determined in the frame of the universal long - range theory . as a second free parameter , the dimensionless quantity @xmath25 describes the unknown decay rate of efimov states into deeply bound dimer states plus a free atom and thus characterizes the resonance width .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are based on the magnetically tunable interaction properties of cs atoms@xcite in the lowest internal state . by applying fields between @xmath26 and @xmath27 g </S>",
    "<S> , we varied the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 in a range between @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is bohr s radius . </S>",
    "<S> accurate three - body loss measurements are facilitated by the fact that inelastic two - body loss is energetically forbidden@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic range of the two - body potential is given by the van der waals length@xcite , which for cs is @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves us with enough room to study the universal regime requiring @xmath32 . for negative @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> a maximum value of @xmath33 is attainable for @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> efimov s estimate @xmath35 for the number of weakly bound trimer states@xcite suggests the presence of one efimov resonance in the accessible range of negative scattering lengths .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results ( fig .  [ rec_length ] ) , obtained with optically trapped thermal samples of cs atoms in two different set - ups ( see methods ) , indeed show a giant loss feature marking the expected resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we present our data in terms of a recombination length@xcite @xmath36^{1/4}$ ] , which leads to the simple relation @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the general @xmath18-scaling corresponds to a linear behavior in @xmath38 ( straight lines in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a fit of the analytic theory@xcite to our experimental data taken for negative @xmath0 at temperatures @xmath39nk shows a remarkable agreement and determines the resonance position to @xmath40 and the decay parameter to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced resonance behavior with a small value for the decay parameter ( @xmath42 ) demonstrates a sufficiently long lifetime of efimov trimers to allow their observation as distinct quantum states .    </S>",
    "<S> all the results discussed so far are valid in the zero - energy collision limit of sufficiently low temperatures . for ultralow but non - zero temperatures the recombination length is unitarity limited@xcite to @xmath43 . for @xmath44nk </S>",
    "<S> this limit corresponds to about @xmath45 and our sample is thus cold enough to justify the zero - temperature limit . for 250nk </S>",
    "<S> , however , unitarity limits the recombination length to about @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the efimov resonance is still visible at temperatures of 200 and 250nk ( filled triangles and open diamonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rec_length ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slight shift to lower values of @xmath1 suggests the evolution of the zero - energy efimov resonance into a triatomic continuum resonance@xcite . in further experiments at higher temperatures ( data not shown ) we observed the resonance to disappear above @xmath47500nk </S>",
    "<S> .    for positive scattering lengths , we found three - body losses to be typically much weaker than for negative values . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are consistent with a maximum recombination loss of @xmath48 , or equivalently @xmath49 , as predicted by different theories@xcite ( straight line for @xmath10 in fig .  [ rec_length ] ) . for @xmath0 below @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> the measured recombination length significantly drops below this upper limit ( inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic expression from effective field theory@xcite for @xmath10 reads @xmath51 + \\sinh^2\\eta_+ \\right ) + 16.8\\ , ( 1-e^{-4\\eta_+})$ ] with the two free parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term describes recombination into the weakly bound dimer state with an oscillatory behavior due to an interference effect between two different pathways@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second term results from decay into deeply bound states . </S>",
    "<S> we use this expression to fit our data points with @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this somewhat arbitrary condition is introduced as a reasonable choice to satisfy @xmath55 for the validity of the universal theory . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is quite insensitive to the value of the decay parameter and yields @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the theoretical assumption@xcite of the same value for the decay parameter for positive and negative @xmath0 , which in our case is @xmath57 . for maximum loss , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath58 . according to theory@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the trimer state hits the dimer - atom threshold at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic periodicity of the efimov scenario suggests adjacent loss minima to occur at @xmath60 and at @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> while the former value is out of our accessible range , the latter value ( @xmath62 ) is too small to strictly justify universal behavior in the resonance limit ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our experimental results ( inset to fig .  [ rec_length ] ) indicate a minimum at @xmath64 and the analytic expression for @xmath19 is found to describe our data quite well down to this minimum .    </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of the interference minimum in three - body loss is demonstrated more clearly in another set of experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ loss_fraction ] ) , where we simply measured the loss of atoms after a fixed storage time in the optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum is located at @xmath65 in addition to a second minimum close to zero scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the existence of the minimum at @xmath66 is very advantageous for efficient evaporative cooling of cs as it combines a large scattering cross section with very low loss . </S>",
    "<S> inadvertently , we have already benefitted of this loss minimum for the optimized production of a bose - einstein condensate of cs@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of our experimental results to available three - body theory shows remarkable agreement , although the collision physics of cs is in general a very complicated multi - channel scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the particular nature of the broad , `` open - channel dominated '' feshbach resonance@xcite that underlies the tunability of our system plays a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> for such a resonance , the two - body scattering problem can be reduced to an effective single - channel model . </S>",
    "<S> it is a very interesting question to what degree this great simplification of the two - body physics extends to the three - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> here we in particular raise question how the regions of positive and negative scattering lengths are connected in our experiment , where @xmath0 is changed through a zero crossing , i.e.  through a non - universal region , and not across the universal resonance region . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , there is no obvious connection between the efimov state that leads to the observed resonance for @xmath67 and the states responsible for the behavior for @xmath10 . in our analysis of the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we have thus independently fitted the data sets for negative and positive @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the resulting values for the two independent fit parameters @xmath22 and @xmath52 suggest a connection : for the ratio @xmath68 our experiment yields 1.25(9 ) , whereas universal theory@xcite predicts 0.96(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> . these numbers are quite close in view of the efimov factor of 22.7 . </S>",
    "<S> if not an accidental coincidence , we speculate that the apparent relation between @xmath52 and @xmath22 may be a further consequence of universality in a system where the resonant two - body interaction can be modelled in terms of a single scattering channel . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the multi - channel nature of three - body collisions near feshbach resonances@xcite leads to further interesting questions , like e.g.  possible resonance effects beyond the efimov scenario . </S>",
    "<S> advances in three - body theory are necessary to finally answer these questions and to provide a complete interpretation of our present observations .    in the past few years , applications of feshbach resonances in ultracold gases and the resulting possibility to create </S>",
    "<S> dimer states have set the stage for many new developments in matter - wave quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of an efimov resonance now confirms the existence of weakly bound trimer states and opens up new vistas@xcite to experimentally explore the intriguing physics of few - body quantum systems .    </S>",
    "<S> * methods *    * magnetic tuning of the two - body interaction * for cs atoms in their energetically lowest state ( quantum numbers @xmath69 for the total spin and @xmath70 for its projection ) the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 varies strongly with the magnetic field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> between 0 and 150 g the dependence can in general be well approximated by the fit formula @xmath71 except for a few narrow feshbach resonances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth variation of the scattering length in the low - field region results from a broad feshbach resonance centered at about @xmath72 g ( equivalent to @xmath73 g in the state @xmath69 , @xmath74 ) . in all our measurements we excluded the magnetic field regions where the narrow feshbach resonances influence the scattering behavior through coupling to other molecular potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the efimov resonance is centered at 7.5 g .    * </S>",
    "<S> trap setups and preparation of the cs gases * all measurements were performed with trapped thermal samples of cs atoms at temperatures @xmath75 ranging from 10 to 250nk . </S>",
    "<S> we used two different experimental setups , which have been described elsewhere@xcite .    in setup </S>",
    "<S> a we first produced an essentially pure bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with up to 250,000 atoms in a far - detuned crossed optical dipole trap generated by two 1060-nm yb - doped fiber laser beams@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then ramped the magnetic field to 16.2 g where the scattering length is negative with a value of @xmath76 , thus inducing a collapse of the condensate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after an equilibration time of 1s we were left with a thermal sample at typically @xmath77nk containing up to 20,000 atoms at peak densities ranging from @xmath78@xmath79 to @xmath80@xmath79 . alternatively , we interrupted the evaporation process before condensation to produce thermal samples at @xmath81nk in a crossed dipole trap generated by one of the 1060-nm beams and a @xmath82-@xmath83 m co@xmath84-laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> after recompression of the trap this produced typical densities of @xmath85@xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements in the region of the loss minima as displayed in fig.[loss_fraction ] were taken after a storage time of 200ms at initial densities of @xmath86@xmath79 .    in setup </S>",
    "<S> b we used an optical surface trap@xcite in which we prepared a thermal sample of 10,000 atoms at @xmath87nk via forced evaporation at a density of @xmath88@xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole trap was formed by a repulsive evanescent laser wave on top of a horizontal glass prism in combination with a single horizontally confining 1060-nm laser beam propagating along the vertical direction .    </S>",
    "<S> * determination of three - body loss rate coefficients * we measured three - body loss rates in setup a by recording the time evolution of the atom number @xmath89 and the temperature @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of this procedure has been given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in brief </S>",
    "<S> , the process of three - body recombination not only leads to a loss of atoms , but also induces `` anti - evaporation '' and recombination heating . </S>",
    "<S> the first effect is present at any value of the scattering length @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second effect occurs for positive values of @xmath0 when the recombination products remain trapped . </S>",
    "<S> atom loss and temperature rise are modelled by a set of two coupled non - linear differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> we used numerical solutions to this set of equations to fit our experimental data . from these fits together with measurements of the trapping parameters we obtained the rate coefficient @xmath15 . in setup </S>",
