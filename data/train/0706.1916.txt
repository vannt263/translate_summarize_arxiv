    "growth rates and spatial growth lengths obtained from the linearized equations or from the present relatively low resolution simulations only provide guidelines to the rate at which perturbations grow or damp .    a rapid decline in perturbation amplitudes in the sheath as a function of radius , governed by a hankel function in the dispersion relation , suggests that the present results will apply to sheaths more than about three times the spine radius in thickness .    where flow and magentic fields are parallel , current driven ( * cd * ) modes are stable ( isotomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ) . however , we expect magnetic fields to have a significant toroidal component",
