    "i would like the reader to pay attention to ( @xcite , sect .",

    "one of the sentences reads as follows .    *",
    "_  for level @xmath84 flows , the corresponding differential equation _ ( that is , ( [ f - eq ] ) )",
    "_ has a solution of the form @xmath85 , where @xmath79 is rational while @xmath86 is algebraic but not rational \" .",
    "_    we will soon see that this can be proved without appealing to reduction of vector fields , so all the results about rational flows , except those in ( @xcite , sect .",

    "this gives rise to a rational flow of level @xmath20 .",
    "this was explored in ( @xcite , sect .",
    ". the vector field can be easily integrated , and it gives rational projective flow @xmath90 .",
    "henceforth we assume @xmath91 .",
    "+ if this is the case , we will need one fact .",
    "let @xmath92 is any projective flow with a rational vector field .",
    "suppose that for every pair @xmath93 , the function @xmath94 , as a function in @xmath54 , is constant .",
    "then @xmath95 now , take the limit @xmath96 .",
    "this gives @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and this implies @xmath87 - a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath99      the logical mistake is contained in ( @xcite , subsection 4.1 step i , p. 301 ) :    * _  in fact , we do not need to worry about the linear change @xmath100 . with this trick in mind , we can , without loss of generality , consider @xmath101 and solve the problem of finding @xmath62 with an additional @xmath31 variables @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 in our disposition , with a single crucial restriction @xmath106 \" .",
    "_    in fact , if we are more careful and worry about the linear change , we arrive at the observation that a linear change does not add an additional freedom in the reduction : the equations ( 47 ) , ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) in @xcite are also subject to a linear changes . after contemplating some time ,",
    "this becomes obvious by the following two reasons .",
    "let @xmath107 , @xmath106 .",
    "as special examples show , the vector fields @xmath34 and @xmath108 are not in any way related .",
    "for example , take @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "this is a level @xmath2 rational flow , explicitly given by @xmath111 on the other hand , the flow with the vector field @xmath112 is a superflow over @xmath113 @xcite , linearly conjugate ( over complex numbers ) to the superflow over @xmath27 with the vector field @xmath22 ; the latter was explored in detail in @xcite . in particular , this flow can be integrated in terms of dixonian elliptic functions .",
    "thus , flows with vector fields @xmath114 and @xmath112 are not in any way related .",
    "the logic was that suitably conjugating a flow linearly in advance , we can afterwards find such a @xmath2-bir @xmath14 that a flow @xmath42 has a vector field whose denominator is of lower degree than that of @xmath41 .",
    "however , according to ( proposition 15 , @xcite ) , @xmath115 where homogenic polynomials",
    "@xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "suppose now that the flow on the left has a vector field whose common denominator has a lower degree than the vector field of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the flow on the left is equal to the flow on the right .",
    "now , it is obvious that linear conjugation does not alter the degree of the denominator , so already the flow @xmath118 has a vector field with the lower degree denominator .",
    "so , denominators can be lowered with @xmath2-bir transformations @xmath49 only , and linear conjugation should not be considered at all while carrying on a reduction .",
    "thus , reduction of vector fields are possible , as numerous examples in ( @xcite , sect .",
    "2 ) show , but in much more limited cases .",
    "the correct missing ingredient of the proof follows from techniques developed in @xcite . we know that if @xmath119 is a projective flow , then @xmath120 satisfies the system of ( in fact , two independent ) pdes @xmath121 these and the boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) uniquely determine the flow .",
    "+ on the other hand , as the consequence of results in @xcite , we get the following fundamental claim , which immediately lets to integrate the vector field @xmath34 in closed form in many cases , and replaces the differential system into the system of ( generally , transcendental ) non - differential equations .",
    "suppose , @xmath91 , and a pair of functions @xmath120 satisfies the system of pde ( [ pde - u ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "then the following system is satisfied : @xmath122 here @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the solutions of , respectively , ( [ f - eq ] ) and ( [ w - eq ] ) .",
    "[ thm1 ]    these , together with boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) , yield the flow . as we will soon see , this proposition is an example of  bootstrapping \" phenomenon .",
    "in fact , boundary conditions can also be accommodated into the system ( [ impl ] ) as follows .",
    "let @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "then the second equation of ( [ impl ] ) gives , after a substitution @xmath127 , @xmath128",
    "so , we choose the solution @xmath129 of this and @xmath130 which is equal to @xmath93 at @xmath131 . if fact , only when dealing with rational flows we have no question of ramification . in all other cases",
    "the second equation of the system ( [ impl ] ) should be interpreted in the sense just described .",
    "+ though theorem [ thm1 ] gives two equations , we can confine just to the second one due to the following fact .",
    "note that for any integer @xmath17 , the solution to the homogeneous differential equation @xmath132 is given by @xmath133 .",
    "so , if we take a look at the case @xmath134 , it implies that the general solution to ( [ f - eq ] ) is given by @xmath135 , where @xmath79 is any special solution .",
    "now , suppose that @xmath123 satisfies the second equation of ( [ impl ] ) . since @xmath136 is arbitrary , this gives the second equation of ( [ impl ] ) for @xmath137 , and the first equation of ( [ impl ] ) for @xmath67 .",
    "the formulas ( [ impl ] ) were worked out in detail for special examples in ( @xcite , sections 4.2 , 6 , 7 , 8) and also in ( @xcite , section 3 ) , but they hold in general .",

    "thus , @xmath143 finally , the last displayed line on ( p. 748 , @xcite ) , or the above formulas , too , show that @xmath144 .",
    "this gives ( [ impl ] ) .",
    "+ note that the formulas ( [ form ] ) do not depend which special solution @xmath123 to ( [ f - eq ] ) is being used . indeed , keeping @xmath145 fixed , and taking different @xmath76 changes it by a summand @xmath146 .",
    "let new values are denoted by adding @xmath147 : @xmath148 thus , @xmath149 does not change , and so @xmath150 does not change .",
    "further , we have : @xmath151 also , we can choose @xmath152 , @xmath153 , instead of @xmath67 .",
    "similar calculation shows that this also does not affect the final formulas , and so @xmath154 are defined uniquely .",
    "sure , we must be careful as far as ramification is concerned - for abelian flows , for example , @xmath102 is an abelian integral , and generally it is multi - valued . to avoid these problems",
    ", we must consider a pair @xmath129 for @xmath54 small enough .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "+ there exists the second , a direct but more tedious way to prove ( [ z ] ) .",
    "indeed , the boundary conditions show that at @xmath131 both sides of ( [ z ] ) coincide .",
    "now , let us take the derivative with respect to @xmath54 of the left side .",
    "this gives @xmath155 when @xmath131 , this becomes @xmath156 according to ( [ f - eq ] ) , this is equal to @xmath80 , exactly the value of the derivative at @xmath131 of the right hand side of ( [ z ] ) .",
    "we then act by an induction and verify that ( [ pde - u ] ) imply that higher derivatives at @xmath131 of the left hand side of ( [ z ] ) vanish .      now",
    ", suppose @xmath92 is an algebraic projective plane flow .",
    "then from ( [ z ] ) we infer that @xmath157 this is the same as the first displayed eq . on p. 756 in @xcite .",
    "we now repeat the same argument as the one given in @xcite , p. 755 . indeed , according to the fact ( [ not - constant ] )",
    ", there exists a pair @xmath93 such that the function @xmath94 is a non - constant algebraic function in @xmath54 . the right hand side of ( [ mono ] ) ,",

    "we know that @xmath159 is not a constant .",
    "we can write this as @xmath160 , or @xmath161 .",
    "the inverse of an algebraic function is an algebraic itself : if @xmath162 $ ] and @xmath163 , then @xmath164 .",
    "this shows that @xmath76 is also algebraic !",
    "this is a crucial consequence of the eq .",
    "( [ f - eq ] ) for algebraic ( and rational ) flows .",

    "first , assume that @xmath171 . if every solution to ( [ g - eq ] ) is rational , then the claim is obvious , and follows from general properties of non - homogeneous linear differential equations , @xmath172 in this case .",

    "it satisfies the monic minimal equation @xmath176 the function @xmath177 satisfies the ode ( [ g - eq ] ) too , but with the right side now equal to some rational function @xmath178 .",
    "there are two cases to consider - * ( i ) * this rational function is equal to @xmath20 , and * ( ii ) * it is not .",
    "+ * ( i ) * we need to show that if all solutions to @xmath179 are algebraic , then @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is a rational function , @xmath182 .",
    "this part follows easily from calculus routines .",
    "indeed , we have : @xmath183 expressing a rational function @xmath184 as a sum over integral part and primitive fractions , we see that the right hand side is algebraic only if @xmath185 thus , @xmath186 in fact , it belongs to @xmath173 : if @xmath187 and @xmath188 are non - real complex conjugates , the integers @xmath189 and @xmath190 coincide , since @xmath62 , @xmath191 are defined over @xmath27 .",

    "the conclusion is that investigation of projective flows is a more efficient way to study affine flows ! moreover , in projective flow case time parameter is integrated into a collection of space parameters , and so the questions of algebraic , rational flows is unambiguous , whereas the same questions for affine flows are ambiguous .",
