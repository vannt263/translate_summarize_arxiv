    "the idea , based on the work of casson and gordon @xcite , is to lift a heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold to a finite cover in which there are disjoint compressing disks on each side . by compressing the lifted heegaard surface along an appropriate choice of such disks ,",

    "we shall give a condition on the 2-handle which , if satisfied , ensures that in all large enough cyclic covers , the lifted heegaard splitting can be compressed to obtain an essential surface .",
    "there is also a statement about incompressibility after dehn surgery .",
    "freedman and freedman ( @xcite ) have already proved that , in _ any _ non - fibered knot manifold , all but finitely many cyclic covers are large ( i.e. contain closed essential surfaces ) .",
    "cooper and long @xcite then proved a result about virtually haken dehn surgery for these manifolds , and also obtained a bound on the number of excluded covers in terms of the genus of the knot .",
    "however , our results provide a computational benefit .",
    "we computed , for all of the 453 non - fibered , 2-generator knot manifolds in the snappea census , a covering degree past which all cyclic covers are large , and the bounds obtained are typically improvements over known bounds .    for other connections between heegaard splittings and virtually haken 3-manifolds ,",

    "we claim that @xmath376 has incompressible boundary .",
    "suppose otherwise , and let @xmath279 be a compressing disk . since @xmath193 has incompressible boundary , the maximal compression body for @xmath377 has a unique disk system consisting only of @xmath378 .",

    "suppose @xmath279 is separating , so it separates off a solid torus @xmath382 , with @xmath383 . since @xmath384 , we have @xmath385 .",
