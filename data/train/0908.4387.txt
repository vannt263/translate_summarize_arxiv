    "one needs to remove the top right corner of the rectangle and then collapse its top and right side .",
    "as we explain in more detail in @xcite , it also corresponds to a joint resolution of the two singularities of the toric variety corresponding to the _ complement _ of the triangle in the positive quadrant .",

    "the first dot is white , and the others are black .",
