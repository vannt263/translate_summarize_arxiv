    "one of the source of progress of the sciences depends on the study of the same problem from different point of view . besides their progress of the sciences",
    "those different point of views include a lot of mathematical tastes . over the years considerable",
    "attention has been paid to the solution of schrdinger equation .",
    "determination of eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation via asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) has recently attracted some interest , arising from the development of fast computers ciftci1,ciftci2,ciftci3,saad .",
    "this method have been widely applied to establish eigenvalues of the schrdinger type equations koc1,koc2,barakat , fernandez , soylu , olgar1 .",
    "although the aim formalism is very efficient to obtain eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation , it requires tedious calculations in order to determine wave function if the system is not exactly solvable .",
    "when schrdinger equation includes a non solvable potential , the calculation of wave function involved with a large number of terms will lose its simplicity and accuracy .    in this paper we will discuss new formalism based on the taylor series expansion method , namely asymptotic taylor expansion method ( atem).although , taylor series method @xcite is an old one",
    ", it appears , however , not has been fully exploited in the analysis of both in solution of physical and mathematical problems . yet ,",
    "even today , new contributions to this problem are being made @xcite .",
    "apart from its formal relation to aim , atem has also been easily applied to solve second order linear differential equations by introducing a simple computer program .",
    "we would like to mention here that the atem is a field of tremendous scope and has an almost unlimited opportunity , for its applications in the solution of the schrdinger type equations .",
    "one can display a number of fruitful applications of the atem in different fields of the physics .",
    "for instance , our formalism of atem gives a new approach to the series solution of the differential equations as well as interrelation between series solution of differential equations and aim .",
    "the method can also be applied to solve dirac equation and klein gordon equation . in this paper",
    "we address ourselves to the solution of the eigenvalue problems by using the atem .",
    "one of the fundamental advantage of atem is that ( approximate ) analytical expressions for the wave function of the associated hamiltonian can easily be obtained .",
    "we note that atem  also gives an accurate result for the eigenvalues when it is compared to aim .",
    "it should also be noted here that the determination of wave function by using aim require tedious calculations if the system is not exactly solvable . for non exactly solvable potentials ,",
    "the calculation of wave function by using aim involved with a large number of terms will lose its simplicity and accuracy .",
    "therefore , the method introduced here is useful to determine an analytical expression for the wave function of the non exactly solvable equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first main result of the paper is given in section by reformulating the well known taylor series expansion of a function .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the application of the main result for solving the schrdinger equation including various potentials . as a practical example , we illustrate solution of the schrdinger equation including anharmonic oscillator potential and the hamiltonian of an interacting electron in a quantum dot . in this section",
    "we present an approximate analytical expression for eigenfunction and numerical results for eigenvalues of the anharmonic oscillator potential and the hamiltonian of an interacting electron in a quantum dot .",
    "we also analyze asymptotic behavior of the hamiltonian .",
    "finally we comment on the validity of our method and remark on its possible use in different fields of the physics in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we show the solution of the schrdinger equation for a quite ample class of potentials , by modifying taylor series expansion by means of a finite sequence instead of an infinite sequence and its termination possessing the property of quantum mechanical wave function . in quantum mechanics bound state energy of the atom is quantized and eigenvalues are discrete and for each eigenvalues there exist one or more an eigenfunctions .",
    "when we are dealing with the solution of the schrdinger equation we are mainly interested in the discrete eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "the first main result of this conclusion gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the termination of the taylor series expansion of the wave function .",
    "let us consider taylor series expansion of a function @xmath0 about the point @xmath1:@xmath2where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 derivative of the function at @xmath1 .",
    "taylor series specifies the value of a function at one point , @xmath5 , in terms of the value of the function and its derivatives at a reference point @xmath1 .",
    "expansion of the function @xmath0 about the origin ( @xmath6 ) , is known as maclaurin s series and it is given by,@xmath7here we develop a method to solve a second order linear differential equation of the form : @xmath8it is obvious that the higher order derivatives of the @xmath0 can be obtained in terms of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 by differentiating ( a2 ) .",
    "then , higher order derivatives of @xmath0 are given by@xmath10where@xmath11of course , the last result shows there exist a formal relation between aim and atem . to this end",
    ", we conclude that the recurrence relations ( [ a4 ] ) allow us algebraic exact or approximate analytical solution of ( [ a2 ] ) under some certain conditions .",
    "let us substitute ( [ a4 ] ) into the ( a1 ) to obtain the function that is related to the wave function of the corresponding hamiltonian:@xmath12after all we have obtained an useful formalism of the taylor expansion method .",
    "this form of the taylor series can also be used to obtain series solution of the second order differential equations . in the solution of the eigenvalue problems , truncation of the the asymptotic expansion to a finite number of terms",
    "is useful .",
    "if the series optimally truncated at the smallest term then the asymptotic expansion of series is known as superasymptotic @xcite , and it leads to the determination of eigenvalues with minimum error .",
    "arrangement of the boundary conditions for different problems becomes very important because improper sets of boundary conditions may produce nonphysical results .",
    "when only odd or even power of @xmath5 collected as coefficients of @xmath13 or @xmath14 and vice verse , the series is truncated at @xmath15 then an immediate practical consequence of these condition for @xmath16 or @xmath17 in this way , the series truncates at @xmath15 and one of the parameter in the @xmath18 or @xmath19 belongs to the spectrum of the schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore eigenfunction of the equation becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath20 .",
    "otherwise the spectrum of the system can be obtained as follows : in a quantum mechanical system eigenfunction of the system is discrete . therefore in order to terminate the eigenfunction @xmath0 we can concisely write that@xmath21eliminating @xmath13 and @xmath14 we obtain@xmath22again one of the parameter in the equation related to the eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "we can state that the atem reproduces exact solutions to many exactly solvable differential equations and these equations can be related to the schrdinger equation .",
    "it will be shown in the following section atem also gives accurate results for non - solvable schrdinger equations , such as the sextic oscillator , cubic oscillator , deformed coulomb potential , etc . which are important in applications to many problems in physics .",
    "this asymptotic approach opens the way to the treatment of  schrdinger type equation including large class of potentials of practical interest .",
    "an analytical solution of the schrdinger equation is of high importance in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , because the wave function contains all necessary information for full description of a quantum system . in this section",
    "we take a new look at the solution of the schrdinger equation by using the method of atem developed in the previous section .",
    "let us consider the following eigenvalue problem ( @xmath23)@xmath24where @xmath25 is the potential , @xmath26 is wave function and @xmath27 is the energy of the system . the equation has been solved exactly for a large number of potentials by employing various techniques . in general , it is difficult to determine the asymptotic behavior of ( [ a51 ] ) in the present form .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to transform ( [ a51 ] ) to an appropriate form by introducing the wave function @xmath28 .",
    "thus , this change of wave function guaranties @xmath29 .",
    "we recast ( [ a51 ] ) and we obtain the following equation@xmath30 in this formalism of the equation coefficients in ( [ a2 ] ) can be expressed as:@xmath31using the relation given in ( [ a4 ] ) one can easily compute @xmath32 and @xmath33 by a simple mathematica program .",
    "our task is now to illustrate the use of atem to obtain explicit analytical solution of the schrdinger equation including various potentials .",
    "solution of the schrdinger equation including anharmonic potential has attracted a lot of attention , arising its considerable impact on the various branches of physics as well as biology and chemistry .",
    "the equation is described by the hamiltonian@xmath34 in practice anharmonic oscillator problem is always used to test accuracy and efficiency of the unperturbative methods .",
    "let us introduce , the asymptotic solutions of anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian when @xmath35 , then the wave function takes the form@xmath36and ( [ a61 ] ) can be expressed as@xmath37comparing the equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a71 ] ) we can deduce that@xmath38here we take a new look at the solution of the ( [ a71 ] ) by using the method of atem developed in the previous section . by applying ( [ a5z ] ) , the corresponding energy eigenvalues are calculated by the aid of a mathematica program .",
    "the term asymptotic means the function approaching to a given value as the iteration number tends to infinity . by the aid of mathematica program",
    "we calculate eigenvalues @xmath27and eigenfunction @xmath0 for @xmath39 using number of iterations @xmath40 .",
    "the eigenvalues are presented in table i and and are compared with results computed by the aim @xcite and direct numerical integration method @xcite by taking @xmath41    .eigenvalues of the ( [ o1 ] ) for different iteration numbers @xmath42 and @xmath41last two rows corresponds the comparison of eigenvalues computed by the aim @xcite , direct numerical integration method @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the basic features of our approach are to reformulate taylor series expansion of a function for obtaining both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger type equations .",
    "furthermore the technique given here has been applied to determine the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the anharmonic oscillator and the hamiltonian of two electrons in a quantum dot .",
    "we have shown that atem gives accurate results for eigenvalue problems .    as a further work atem",
    "can be developed in various directions .",
    "position dependent mass hamiltonians @xcite can be solved by extending the method given in this paper . in particular , lie algebraic or bosonic hamiltonians can be solved within the framework of the method given here . before ending this work a remark is in order .",
    "this extension leads to the solution of various matrix hamiltonians , dirac equation and klein - gordon equation .",
