    "the sz - effect is rapidly turning into an important astrophysical tool thanks to the progress of the observational techniques , which allow increasingly precise measurements . in view of these developments",
    "it is thus relevant to study further corrections to it , such as relativistic effects @xcite , the shape of the galaxy cluster and its finite extension or a polytropic temperature profile ( see e.g. @xcite ) , corrections induced by halo rotation @xcite , brillouin scattering @xcite , early galactic winds @xcite and the presence of cooling flows @xcite .",
    "these additional effects are of different relevance and often depend on the specific cluster values .",
    "+ whereas , e.g. cooling flows are not present in every cluster of galaxies , the need for relativistic corrections due to energetic non - thermal electron populations seems to be common in most clusters .",
    "these relativistic electrons produce a hard x - ray component in excess of the thermal spectrum by compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and by non - thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "their emission has been quite possibly detected in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite by rxte and bepposax satellites .",
    "the main evidence for the existence of relativistic electrons comes from radio synchrotron emission of extended intracluster regions @xcite and is , therefore , closely related to the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic fields in the intracluster gas lead to acceleration processes and modify the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the electrons , which might acquire a significantly non - thermal spectrum and thus account for the observed hard x - ray spectra @xcite . consequently , several authors @xcite derived relativistic corrections to the thermal sz - effect up to different leading orders . though the magnetic field is related to the relativistic electron population ,",
    "its own influence - as a non - thermal cluster component - on the sz - effect has not yet been investigated .",
    "whereas the importance of relativistic corrections to the sz - effect depends on the cluster temperature , the magnetic field seems to be ubiquitous with a mean field value of @xmath2 in the cluster cores @xcite .",
    "independently of the diffuse non - thermal radio emission , excess faraday rotation measure of polarized radio emission in radio sources within or behind the cluster can prove the existence of magnetic fields .",
    "this method was applied to the cluster , where @xcite found a large magnetic field of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite found a similar value ( @xmath2 ) for .",
    "@xcite derived magnetic field strengths of a few @xmath4 for their cluster sample by using a statistical faraday rotation measure technique .",
    "unfortunately , the structure of the magnetic field is presently poorly known .",
    "contrary to the static situation in non - cooling flow clusters , the magnetic field is believed to become dynamically significant in the cores of cooling flow clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a magnetic field strength of up to @xmath5 in the cluster . the converging cooling flow",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) causes a compression and enhancement in the magnetic field strength and finally reconnection might transfer the magnetic energy back to the plasma when the magnetic field pressure becomes comparable to the thermal gas pressure .",
    "+ as the ratio of the magnetic pressure ( @xmath6 ) to the gas pressure ( @xmath7 ) reaches @xmath8 for the quoted values of non - cooling flow clusters and even unity for the cores of cooling flow clusters , we consider the additional magnetic field pressure term to be significant and we will examine its influence on the sz - effect .",
    "we remark that all the quoted values refer to large scale magnetic fields with a coherence length of typically @xmath9 .",
    "there are essentially no useful limits on the strength of any small scale magnetic fields .",
    "our calculation is based on a macroscopic picture inferred from the existence of this additional ( large scale ) pressure component and we do not start our considerations at the level of the single particle movement in a magnetic field .",
    "the current cluster data reveal magnetic field values which result to be significant for a correct sz analysis , especially towards the cluster core where the electron density increases .",
    "+ the aim of the paper is to examine the influence of large scale magnetic fields on the thermal sz - effect .",
    "we , therefore , choose a phenomenological approach , where the addition of a magnetic field pressure to the gas pressure is well justified .",
    "for a given magnetic field model , we can then estimate the change in the electron density and the temperature profiles as compared to standard ones used in the literature in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the theoretical model for the magnetic field contribution .",
    "we derive new gas density profiles which are then used to calculate the sz - effect .",
    "we distinguish two situations according to whether a cluster harbours a cooling flow or not .",
    "section 3 shows our results and contains a discussion of how magnetic fields influence the sz signal and what are the observational consequences . as an illustration",
    "we apply our results to the non - cooling flow cluster .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "we suppose a standard spherically symmetric model for a cluster , which is assumed to be in a relaxed state with a static gravitational potential . thus , hydrostatic equilibrium can be expected .",
    "the intracluster plasma is treated as an ideal gas and thus the well known hydrostatic equilibrium equation has the form ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radius dependent gas density and pressure , respectively , and @xmath14 is the gravitating mass within the radius @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 is mainly determined by the dark matter profile , whereas the gas mass contribution is negligible .",
    "when taking into account magnetic fields , the hydrostatic equilibrium eq.([ncf1 ] ) has to be completed with a magnetic hydrostatic pressure term @xmath6 of the form :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the magnetic field strength , which is supposed to be spherically symmetric . thus , the magnetic field contributes to the total pressure opposing the gravitational force .",
    "the gas pressure @xmath13 in eq.([ncf1 ] ) is replaced by the sum of gas and magnetic field pressure :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 the mean molecular weight , @xmath21 the proton mass and @xmath22 the gas temperature at radius @xmath15 . + when deriving the mass distribution from eq.([ncf1 ] ) , either with only the gas pressure or with the magnetic field pressure added as in eq.([ncf3 ] ) , we obviously end up with the two different equations :    @xmath23 ,                         \\label{ncf4}\\\\ \\mathcal{m}_b(r)&=&-\\frac{k\\,t_b(r)}{g\\,\\mu\\,m_p}r\\left[\\frac{d\\ln\\rho_b(r)}{d\\ln r }                   + \\frac{d\\ln t_b(r)}{d\\ln r}\\right ] -                    \\frac{r^2}{g\\,\\rho_b(r)}\\frac{dp_b(r)}{dr } ,   \\label{ncf5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe the gas temperature and density , respectively , in the presence of the magnetic field . + as next we compare the eqs.([ncf4 ] ) and ( [ ncf5 ] ) . to find the cluster mass distribution we can either proceed our analysis according to eq.([ncf4 ] ) or , if we take into account magnetic fields , according to eq.([ncf5 ] ) .",
    "however , the true total gravitating cluster mass is unique and must be the same , thus @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the cluster limiting extension .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be different from @xmath22 and @xmath12 due to the magnetic field pressure gradient . in what follows ,",
    "we want to relate @xmath25 to @xmath12 , which is supposed to be known and to be a correct theoretical description for the gas density profile in absence of magnetic fields ( e.g. @xmath0-model , @xcite ) . + as dark matter is the dominant mass component in clusters of galaxies ( up to @xmath28 of the total mass ) and supposed not to be affected by magnetic fields , we expect in good approximation the equality between the eqs.([ncf4 ] ) and ( [ ncf5 ] ) to be satisfied for all radii @xmath15 :    @xmath29    clearly , this approximation is justified as long as the density profiles @xmath25 and @xmath12 do not differ substantially .",

    "physically , we do not expect the temperatures @xmath35 and @xmath36 to differ significantly .",
    "thus , in the sense of a first order development , we suppose @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be approximately equal , which simplifies the above equation .",
    "mathematically , the boundary condition and the assumption of isothermal temperature profiles even impose @xmath37 : at the limiting radius @xmath27 , the magnetic field pressure gradient in eq.([ncf5 ] ) vanishes and the densities are then equal .",
    "as the temperatures are isothermal , the second term in brackets in the eqs.([ncf4 ] ) and ( [ ncf5 ] ) drops , stating that @xmath38 at @xmath27 , which is then also true for the whole cluster . + to evaluate eq.([ncf7 ] ) we need a magnetic field model .",
    "various physical models have been invoked to explain the rotation measure in radio sources in clusters of galaxies @xcite . according to them ,",
    "the magnetic field distribution is correlated with the electron density of the thermal gas .",
    "recently , @xcite , based upon a correlation between x - ray surface brightness and faraday rotation measure , derived the following relation :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the electron number density and @xmath41 the slope of the @xmath42 relation , which depends on the specific cluster of galaxies .",

    "first , we discuss the solution of the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) with magnetic fields , and second , we give the results of our sz calculation for the magnetic cooling flow model described in section [ cfcluster ] .",
    "we distinguish the cooling flow region from the region outside @xmath74 .",
    "the later one is analysed following the result obtained in section [ noncfcluster ] .",
    "+ once the sonic radius @xmath95 is found from the eqs.([cf10 ] ) and ( [ cf11 ] ) , integrating away from @xmath95 requires then to find nonsingular expressions for the derivatives of the differential eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) .",
    "this is a non - trivial task with the additional magnetic field contribution .",
    "furthermore , this procedure ( shooting method ) requires an iterative process to match the hydrostatic boundary conditions at @xmath74 .",
    "if we want to separate the magnetic field influence , this gets even more complicated as we would have to match both @xmath164 and @xmath165 with the same cooling flow parameter @xmath98 .",
    "we would thus have to find possible values for @xmath166 and @xmath167 at the sonic radius - which differ by the magnetic field contribution in the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) - which must then lead to the required values for @xmath164 and @xmath165 at the cooling radius . since these values at @xmath74 are derived by the procedure described in section [ noncfcluster ] , they are not independent from each other neither , but related through the magnetic field strength @xmath168 .",
    "@xcite were already aware of how sensitive the integration of the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) , in the absence of magnetic fields , can be .",
    "not only three boundary conditions ( @xmath169 ) must be matched , but the possible values of them are additionally constrained by three physically motivated conditions like hydrostatic equilibrium , mass deposition rate and vanishing numerators in the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) for a regular remaining flow .",
    "not surprisingly that the range of allowed boundary conditions to find a transonic flow is extremely small .",
    "+ we stress that our goal is not to develop a sophisticated cooling flow model , but to get an estimate of how magnetic fields can modify the sz - effect in a cooling flow cluster .",
    "we therefore avoid the time consuming and complicated procedure as outlined above , and start our integration with physically reasonable parameters from @xmath74 towards @xmath95 .",
    "the transition at @xmath95 between subsonic and supersonic is always accompanied by shocks . moreover",
    ", this most inner part will also be under the influence of a central galaxy .",
    "since the interplay between cooling flows , central galaxy , shocks and the sz - effect is not clear , we do not attempt to find solutions to the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) inside the sonic radius @xmath95 .",
    "we will , therefore , cut out this supersonic region for our sz calculation . converging cooling flows",
    "amplify the magnetic field strength enormously until the magnetic field pressure ( @xmath6 ) becomes comparable to the thermal gas pressure ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "our numerical studies show that this occurs typically at @xmath170 .",
    "the ultimate fate of the magnetic field is still a matter of debate .",
    "field line reconnection or convective motions resulting in buoyantly rising regions might be possible answers .",
    "furthermore , @xcite pointed out , that more realistic magnetized models can in this region not be treated correctly in spherical symmetry .",
    "based on the above arguments we decided to stop the integration of the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) at the pressure equipartition radius @xmath171 , where @xmath172 .",
    "+ we briefly discuss the input values for our results .",
    "the gravitating cluster mass @xmath14 is fixed as described in section [ cfcluster ] .",
    "we assume that the cooling flow gas makes no significant contribution to the mass density of the cluster . for the region outside @xmath74",
    ", a standard isothermal @xmath0-model with @xmath173 , @xmath174 and a central gas density @xmath175 is consistently adopted .",
    "we choose a magnetic field strength @xmath176 , which reproduces the observed values of the order of @xmath177 for the cluster core , as found from the cooling flow model in the eq.([cf6 ] ) .",
    "assuming again @xmath178 , these values determine then with the eq.([ncf11 ] ) the density profiles @xmath12 and @xmath25 for the region outside @xmath74 , and define the starting values @xmath165 and @xmath164 for the cooling flow region .",
    "once the mass deposition rate @xmath98 is fixed , the continuity eq.([cf4.1 ] ) completely determines the initial velocities @xmath179 and @xmath180 for the integration of the eqs.([cf8 ] ) and ( [ cf9 ] ) . for these velocities at @xmath74 we must require that they are of the order of a few tens of @xmath181 , which corresponds to the turbulent velocity @xmath81 . from the difference between @xmath164 and @xmath165 , ( @xmath182 ) , it is obvious that @xmath183 .",
    "the initial sound speed squared , @xmath184 , is directly related to @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the so derived initial conditions and chosen parameters have to allow for the existence of a cooling flow : @xmath185 . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that the integration with possible values from @xmath74 towards @xmath95 is also limited by constraints , which can be summarized as follows :    @xmath186    these constraints have to be fulfilled with observationally reasonable values @xmath98 and @xmath45 . as a possible set of initial values and cluster parameters we have chosen : @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 . +    the influence of magnetic fields on the cooling flow velocity @xmath191 and the isothermal sound speed @xmath192 as a function of radius .",
    "the mass deposition rate is @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the initial conditions for the integration are : @xmath196 and @xmath190 . ]",
    "fig.[cfdynamics ] shows how the cooling flow dynamics are influenced by magnetic fields .",
    "the integration for the profiles with magnetic fields is stopped at the pressure equipartition radius @xmath197 , whereas the profiles in absence of magnetic fields are stopped close to the sonic radius @xmath95 where the mach number is @xmath198 .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields on the cooling flow gas number density .",
    "parameters and initial conditions as adopted in fig.[cfdynamics ] . ]",
    "fig.[cfdensity ] and fig.[cftemperature ] give the corresponding gas number density and temperature profiles for the cooling flow region .",
    "since the magnetic field strength at @xmath74 is very weak , but the cluster temperature high , the difference between @xmath165 and @xmath164 is completely negligible , as it results from eq.([ncf11 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the initial velocities @xmath199 and @xmath200 can be set equal for all practical purposes .",
    "the influence of the magnetic fields on the sz - effect is thus entirely determined by the cooling flow region .",
    "+ similarly to eq.([r4 ] ) , we define a ratio @xmath201 for the cooling flow @xmath202 region . for our parameters",
    "we find : @xmath203 where we cut out the most central part of the cluster and the lower integration limit is taken to be the pressure equipartition radius @xmath204 .",
    "if the above ratio is completed with the sz contribution from the isothermal region outside @xmath74 , ( @xmath205 with @xmath206 an isothermal @xmath0-model and @xmath207 ) , one finds @xmath208 .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields reduces thus only slightly the cooling flow correction to the sz - effect . when calculating the ratio @xmath209 between the magnetic field influenced profiles and the standard isothermal profiles , we find instead : @xmath210 compared to @xmath211 , which we get without taking into account the magnetic field in the cooling flow .",
    "this is not surprising because of the weakness of the initial magnetic field strength at @xmath74 , which leads to practically identical initial conditions .",
    "the magnetic field strength becomes only important towards the very center and there it then almost compensates the small cooling flow effect .",
    "for the chosen parameters , magnetic field and even cooling flow do not modify much the sz - effect .",
    "+ nevertheless , our numerical investigations showed that for a higher magnetic field strength , @xmath212 , and a higher temperature , @xmath213 , the ratio in eq.([rcf6 ] ) can reach @xmath214 .",
    "moreover , at variance with the above discussed example , a higher magnetic field strength at @xmath74 leads also to a sizeable lower gas density , as compared to the case without magnetic field , in the region outside @xmath74 .",
    "this fact , as discussed in section 3.1.1 , modifies accordingly the contribution to the sz - effect coming from the integration outside @xmath74 . for such cooling flow parameters ,",
    "@xcite expect an overestimation of the standard sz - effect by @xmath1 , due to the presence of a non - magnetized cooling flow .",
    "we instead find that this overestimation gets reduced to @xmath215 when the ( higher ) magnetic field is taken into account .",
    "finally we note that our results are conservative estimates since we always cut out the most central part of the cluster .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields on the cooling flow temperature . parameters and initial conditions as adopted in fig.[cfdynamics ] . ]",
    "in a phenomenological approach we added the magnetic field pressure to the gas pressure and for clusters without cooling flows we derived in a perturbative procedure a new gas density profile .",
    "this can be related to a standard @xmath0-profile and a function , which takes into account the radius dependent magnetic field strength , which is assumed to be correlated to the electron density . for reasonable cluster parameters",
    "we find that magnetic fields reduce the standard sz signal by @xmath1 . indeed",
    ", a reduction of up to @xmath216 seems possible .",
    "our perturbative approach based on the equal mass assumption , @xmath217 , turns out to be well justified by this order of magnitude correction : the corresponding decrease in the gas density is @xmath218 and , therefore , the change in the dark matter dominated total cluster mass profile is less than @xmath133 .",
    "the simplifying assumption of an isothermal temperature is adequate , because the interplay between temperature and a variable magnetic field strength is not yet very clear @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , our considerations showed that the central cluster gas density is probably overestimated by @xmath219 when fitted with a standard @xmath0-model .",
    "better data in future might reveal the need for a modified @xmath0-profile as discussed here .",
    "+ other possible causes of deviations from the ( standard ) @xmath0-model have been discussed in the literature in the context of the determination of the hubble constant ( @xcite and references therein ) . generally , the finite extension of a cluster ( already adopted in our calculation ) lowers the sz signal by @xmath220 compared to the case of an infinite isothermal @xmath0-model , and requires then a larger core radius @xmath101 in the @xmath0-model .",
    "other departures from the standard @xmath0-model include asphericity and small - scale clumping .",
    "the most extreme variation of geometry of the original spherical model is obtained if the unique axis of the prolate ( @xmath221 ) or oblate ( @xmath222 ) gas distribution is oriented along the line of sight .",
    "the sz signal scales then with the factor @xmath223 , which is the ratio of the length of the unique axis to the major or minor axis , respectively . typically , @xmath224 , and asphericity introduces thus a variation of a factor @xmath225 in the core radius @xmath101 .",
    "whereas this effect will be averaged out in a large enough cluster sample , all cluster atmospheres will be clumpy to some degree .",
    "this might result in an overestimation of the standard sz signal at the percentage level , but current simulations are limited in resolution and clumpiness might be more important . whereas all these effects modify the parameters of the standard @xmath0-model , the inclusion of magnetic fields requires an extended @xmath0-profile , which takes explicitly into account the magnetic field strength .",
    "unfortunately , in an integrated sz measurement all the effects will sum up and they can hardly be separated .",
    "precise future x - ray data might then help to reveal the inner cluster structure .",
    "for the cooling flow clusters , following the treatment by @xcite , we generalized the equations for the sound speed and infall velocity derived by @xcite such as to include also a magnetic field . for typical initial magnetic field values at @xmath74 , @xmath226 , we find an equipartition radius @xmath227 and we derive profiles which are in agreement with soker and sarazin . our somewhat larger sonic radius @xmath228 - though not irrealistic as it was found by @xcite , who derived sonic radii of @xmath229 for plausible cluster and cooling flow parameters - results probably from different initial conditions . as the integration for the equations of sound speed and",
    "infall velocity is very delicate or even impossible for any arbitrary combination of parameters , our results can not immediately be generalized .",
    "current discussions about the magnetic field model in the cooling flow region limit further our conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the gas density in the cooling flow gets somewhat smaller in the presence of magnetic fields as compared to the case without .",
    "this translates then into a weaker influence of the order of some percent of the magnetized cooling flow on the sz - effect . in special cases magnetic fields",
    "might almost compensate the cooling flow correction to the sz - effect .",
    "+ indeed , a precise calculation would require more sophisticated models which are adapted to the specific cluster parameters .",
    "for all these reasons , cooling flow clusters do not seem to be ideal targets for sz observations .",
