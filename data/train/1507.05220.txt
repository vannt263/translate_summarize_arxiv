    "reduced electromagnetic fluid models constitute versatile tools for the study of multi - scale phenomena including in particular the interaction of turbulence with magnetohydrodynamic perturbations exhibiting meso - scale structures.@xcite examples include magnetic islands,@xcite edge localized modes,@xcite resonant magnetic perturbations,@xcite as well as fishbone@xcite and alfvn modes.@xcite irrespective of the phenomenon that a particular fluid model aims to describe , the underlying system of charged particles interacting with electromagnetic fields is a hamiltonian system and in addition to energy and other invariants related to symmetry properties , it may possess approximate poincar or adiabatic invariants such as wave actions .",
    "it is highly desirable that a model giving a reduced description should retain this important property in the ideal limit . by ideal limit , we mean the limit of the model when all dissipative terms , such as collisions , landau damping and dissipative anomalous transport terms are neglected .",
    "thus , hamiltonian systems conserve energy for closed boundary conditions and the hamiltonian formulation is useful for investigating the local properties of the dynamics that are independent of the drive .    casting a system into its hamiltonian form@xcite",
    "confers several practical advantages .",
    "one of the most important is the existence of families of invariants , called casimir invariants , which are found in noncanonical hamiltonian systems due to the degeneracy of the cosymplectic matrix .",
    "the functional that results from the addition of the casimirs to the hamiltonian has non - trivial equilibrium states as stationary points . in the absence of a poisson bracket , by contrast",
    ", the existence of non - trivial equilibrium states is not guaranteed .",
    "for example , presents an example of a seemingly reasonable fluid model that lacks physical equilibria with closed streamlines because the equilibrium equations imply that some fields are multiple - valued on closed streamlines .",
    "we can also take advantage of the hamiltonian formulation to construct  energy principles \" for the investigation of the stability of such non - trivial equilibrium states by examining the second variation of the aforementioned functional.@xcite another advantage is that imposing constraints on a system is straightforward in the hamiltonian formalism.@xcite",
    "lastly , the hamiltonian formalism can be used to facilitate the calculation of the statistical average of the zonal flow growth rate.@xcite    among the several classes of fluid models , of particular importance are the ones that retain the effects of finite ion temperature , principally for describing instabilities with growth rates comparable to the ion diamagnetic frequency or modes with perpendicular wavelengths of the order of the ion larmor radius . whereas ",
    "cold ion \" models have been shown to possess noncanonical hamiltonian formulations,@xcite the task of formulating such  hot - ion \" models that satisfy the hamiltonian property has proven difficult .",
    "for example , efforts to identify the hamiltonian structure of the four - field model of were unsuccessful , even though it conserves energy .",
    "the main difficulty with such models lies in the nonlocality of the ion dynamics caused by larmor gyration .",
    "one way to approximate nonlocal terms is by a taylor - series , using @xmath0 as a small parameter .",
    "an example of such a so - called flr model was given in , where a hamiltonian four - field model is constructed , using the  gyromap \" technique to introduce finite ion temperature into the cold ion limit of .",
    "unfortunately , we are unaware of any numerical implementation of this model , possibly because it requires high - order derivatives and , consequently , additional boundary conditions .",
    "an alternative approach for constructing fluid models with a finite ion temperature is to truncate the moment hierarchy of the gyrokinetic equation.@xcite this leads to the use of nonlocal averaging operators that account for the full range of perpendicular wavelengths .",
    "the resulting models are called gyrofluid models .",
    "surprisingly , gyrofluid models are more readily amenable to hamiltonian formulations than flr models .",
    "examples of hamiltonian electromagnetic gyrofluid models are given in for an incompressible ( three fields ) and for a compressible ( four fields ) model .",
    "the four - field gyrofluid model advances the first two moments of the distribution function for each species , or the ion and electron densities and parallel momenta .",
    "zacharias _ et al . _",
    "have shown that simulations of magnetic reconnection using this model are in good agreement with gyrokinetic simulations,@xcite and comisso _ et al .",
    "_ have used it to bring to light the acceleration of magnetic reconnection by nonlocal gyrofluid effects.@xcite grasso _ et al . _ ,",
    "by contrast , have used it to examine the stabilizing effects of ion diamagnetic drifts on the growth and saturation of tearing modes in inhomogeneous plasma.@xcite    in the present paper , we propose a hamiltonian five - field electromagnetic gyrofluid model that is an extension of the model presented in .",
    "the new model , like its predecessor , is a truncation of a more complete one proposed by snyder and hammett , which advances six moments for the ions and two moments for the electron dynamics.@xcite we note that scott@xcite has shown that achieving energy conservation requires modifying several of the terms in involving higher order moments .",
    "we will likewise show that constructing a _ hamiltonian _ model requires modifying the terms involving the higher order moments in our model .",
    "the new model extends that in by the addition of the evolution of the ion temperature . as in the previous model , ion compressibility effects and field curvature",
    "are also included , allowing it to describe itg , kbm , drift waves and tearing modes . to demonstrate the properties of the model",
    ", we present a linear , local study of electrostatic slab itg and toroidal electromagnetic itg modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model equations ] we give the normalizations of our variables and present the ideal limit of the dynamical model . in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we give the hamiltonian formulation of the model equations by providing a conserved energy that serves as the hamiltonian and a lie - poisson bracket that satisfies the jacobi identity . in section [ sec : casimirs ] we calculate the casimir invariants of our system and from them , in section [ sec : normal fields ] we construct five  normal fields \" which are field variables in which the dynamical equations and the bracket take a very simple form .",

    "should be interpreted in terms of its series expansion . at this point , we note that only the ion guiding centers respond to the gyroaveraged value of the electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , we are required to use the gyroaveraged value of the electrostatic potential in the @xmath34 drift advecting the ions whereas , electrons are advected only by the local value of their @xmath34 drift since we neglect the electron larmor radius .",

    "after straightforward manipulations , we obtain a dispersion relation with real part given by @xmath136 and imaginary part by @xmath137 a simple picture of the dynamics of the itg instability , as determined by e.g.  , is given in , a picture that will be helpful for interpreting our results .",
    "a basic scenario for the development of the instability can start with a density perturbation , which is confined to variation along the field line because the @xmath138 velocity across the field lines is incompressible .",

    "we can infer two stability criteria .",

    "the electromagnetic perturbation creates a small component of * b * that is perpendicular to both the background magnetic field and the pressure gradient .",
    "this component then leads to the development of a force on the ions , parallel to the field lines that opposes the attraction from the pressure lowering of itg .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we follow the analysis of kim , horton and dong@xcite and compare our gyrofluid results with their local kinetic ones .",
    "we note , however , that complete agreement can not be expected since kim _",
    "_   has one extra parameter , namely @xmath166 .",
    "we also note that the eigenfrequencies for the model in lie within a few percent of the kinetic results , so that comparing our model to the kinetic results is effectively equivalent to comparing it to the snyder and hammett model .    because the dispersion relation becomes unwieldy and does nt provide much physical insight , we refrain from displaying it here . instead",
    ", we solve it numerically and present the results . figure [ em_growth ]",
    "shows the normalized growth rates for ( a ) the ideal and ( b ) the `` landau '' versions of our model as a function of @xmath1 when @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we also provide the kinetic and fluid model results from for comparison . by the `` landau '' version we mean of course the hamiltonian model augmented by dissipative terms modeling the damping caused by the wave - particle interactions . from fig .",
    "[ em_growth_without ] , it becomes immediately clear that the nonlocal treatment of the ion response in the gyrofluid model reproduces the main qualitative features of the kinetic result much better than the fluid model .",
    "compared to the fluid result , the gyrofluid one gives stronger stabilization of the itg modes and lower thresholds for the excitation of kbms .",
    "this is related to the toroidal resonance . in both fig .",
    "[ em_growth_without ] and fig .",
    "[ em_growth_with ] we observe the close connection between the stabilization of the itg mode and the excitation of the kinetic ballooning mode in accordance with what kinetic theory predicts .",
    "the addition of dissipative terms makes the curves shift closer to the kinetic result although we remark that at low growth rates the agreement is less satisfactory .",

    "toroidal itg is the black line while kbm is the red.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "all parameters are the same as in fig.4 ]    here , we pause to explain an interesting effect , the destabilization due to the addition of dissipation of two previously marginally stable modes ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "for example , for the gf model it is seen in fig .",
    "[ em_growth_without ] that without dissipation the kbm becomes unstable at @xmath172 , while in fig .",
    "[ em_growth_with ] it is seen for the same case with dissipation that this mode is destabilized for all values of @xmath1 . a similar shift from stability to instability can be observed upon comparing these figures for the itg mode , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ em_growth_without ] to transition to instability at a somewhat smaller value of @xmath1 . to understand these transitions consider fig .",
    "[ real_f ] , where we plot the real parts of the frequencies versus @xmath1 for four modes of the gf model without dissipation . in this figure",
    "the two upper most modes are marginally stable for small values of @xmath1 , then as @xmath1 approaches the transition value near @xmath173 they collide and produce instability .",
    "this bifurcation , which is standard in hamiltonian systems , is called the hamiltonian hopf ( or kre@xmath174n ) bifurcation@xcite .",
    "observe , the same bifurcation occurs when two marginally stable modes collide as @xmath1 is decreased to a value near to the kbm transition but closer to @xmath175 , producing the unstable itg mode .",
    "( after the transitions there are also damped modes that are not shown in the figures . )",
    "the dissipative destabilization observed in fig .  [ em_growth_with ] is a generic feature of hamiltonians systems with negative energy modes ( nems ) .",
    "indeed , in hamiltonian systems , whenever a hamiltonian hopf bifurcation occurs , one of the modes _ must _ be a nem , and such modes have the property of getting destabilized with the addition of dissipation ( see e.g.  ref .   for a hamiltonian version of the classical kelvin - tait theorem@xcite ) .",
    "one could perform a calculation like those of refs .",
    ", where the modal eigenvector is inserted into the perturbation energy in order to show explicitly that it is an nem and then show the dissipative terms remove energy from this mode , but such a calculation is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "( a similar situation happens when energy is added to a positive energy mode . )",
    "also note , the previously unstable itg and kbm modes of fig .",
    "[ em_growth_without ] become less unstable at the onset of dissipation , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ em_growth_with ] due to the fact that it becomes harder for a mode to grow when there is less available energy in the system , which is consistent with this scenario .",
    "we reiterate that the purpose of our model is to improve the _ nonlinear _ fidelity of fluid models . from that perspective",
    ", we view the quality of agreement in fig .",
    "[ em_growth ] as adequate .    in fig .",
    "[ em_kpar_with ] we display the dependence of the growth rates of the itg and kbm modes on @xmath145 for various values of @xmath1 for the model augmented with the dissipative terms , with all other parameters remaining the same as in fig .  [ em_growth ] .",
    "values of @xmath1 are in the range @xmath176 .",
    "we observe that the stabilization through the electromagnetic effect becomes more efficient with decreasing @xmath145 .",
    "further , we see again the near simultaneous stabilization of itg and destabilization of kbm as was noted above .",
    "[ em_kpar_with ]    for large values of @xmath145 the mode is stabilized by the large parallel ion transit term.@xcite intuitively , we can understand that the mode is limited by the fact that an appreciable initial density perturbation can not be created within an arbitrarily small length scale .",
    "even before this limit is reached , though , the negative compressibility mentioned above is proportional to the ratio of the ion diamagnetic to the sound frequency ( @xmath177 ) , so that coupling to the sound wave acts as a source of stabilization .",
    "on the other hand , the initial density and potential perturbations , as well as the resulting pressure lowering , are all proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , a finite @xmath145 is needed to overcome the stabilizing effect of curvature and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the mode becomes most unstable at some intermediate value .",
    "we remark that in practice a complete treatment of the effect of @xmath145 requires a nonlocal approach since @xmath178 normally applies , so that the wkb approach in insufficient .    in fig .",
    "[ em_kperp_with ] we illustrate the behavior of the growth rate versus @xmath141 for various values of @xmath1 , with the same parameters as those of the previous figures .",
    "we notice that the peak growth rate occurs around @xmath179 and does not change much with @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the stabilizing effect of @xmath1 is almost uniform for wavenumber values higher than this .",
    "this could be attributed to a very high phase velocity of the wave , which leaves few particles with the right thermal speed to resonate with it . for smaller wavenumbers",
    ", however , the stabilization due to @xmath1 becomes ineffective .",
    "this is because in this region the parallel ion transit term becomes significantly larger than the curvature term and becomes the dominant stabilizing effect .",
    "another important stabilizing effect at high @xmath141 comes from flr physics .",
    "namely , the ions respond to the gyroaveraged electrostatic field , thereby reducing the effective @xmath138 velocity .",
    "[ em_kperp_with ]    in figs .",
    "[ em_kpar_comparison ] and [ em_kperp_comparison ] we compare the hamiltonian model augmented by dissipative terms and the kinetic result from . both figures suggest some common features : again , the qualitative similarity between the hamiltonian and the kinetic curves is evident .",
    "however , there is a quantitative disparity since the hamiltonian result is roughly three times higher than the kinetic one at the peak value of @xmath26 .",
    "this deviation seems to be corrected by taking into account the dissipative terms which lowers the results to at most 30% off from the kinetic ones at peak growth rate .",
    "this amendment , though , does nt come without its own problems , namely the erratic behavior of the dissipative model at low values of @xmath26 .",
    "[ em_kpar_comparison ]     [ em_kperp_comparison ]",
    "we presented a hamiltonian , five - field , electromagnetic gyrofluid model that evolves three moments for the ions ( density , parallel momentum , and parallel temperature ) and two moments for the electrons .",
    "we gave the hamiltonian formulation of the model by providing a suitable hamiltonian and a lie - poisson bracket that satisfies the jacobi identity .",
    "for this system , we found the families of casimir invariants and , from them , we defined five normal fields in terms of which the equations of motion and the bracket take their simplest form .",
    "to evaluate the physical fidelity of the model , we performed a local , linear study of the dispersion relation .",
    "we began by comparing the electrostatic dispersion relation with known analytic results for a slab itg mode .",
    "we found that the critical @xmath140 for the onset of instability is unity for all @xmath141 .",
    "this is very close to the kinetic result for perpendicular wavelengths comparable to and greater than the ion gyroradius , but it is only half of the exact value ( two ) for long wavelengths .",
    "ordinary fluid models , by contrast , yield good agreement at long wavelength but predict negative values of @xmath180 at moderate and short wavelengths . by ordinary fluid models , we refer here to those that are derived from the braginskii model and other long wavelength expansion procedures .",
    "we subsequently examined the electromagnetic properties of the model , including toroidal curvature , by comparing the dependence of the growth rate on well known stabilizing factors and comparing them with the local kinetic result of .",
    "we found good qualitative agreement although the two models can not be directly compared since the latter includes the effects of the electron temperature gradient .",
    "we leave for future work the task of including in the model an electron temperature evolution equation in a manner that preserves the hamiltonian character .",
    "given the wide availability of several high - quality gyrokinetic ( gk ) codes that have been verified and validated in a broad array of contexts , it is appropriate to reflect on the value of gyrofluid ( gf ) models . due to its nature as a truncated moment expansions of the gk model , a gf model such as the one presented here can not aspire to compete with the latter in any but three domains : speed , ease of use , and by virtue of the first two , ability to generate physical insight .",
    "the success of the tglf code@xcite demonstrates that there is a strong demand for an agile quasilinear gf code to understand and interpret experimental observations of turbulent transport .",
    "the motivation for the development of the hamiltonian gf model presented here is similar but different : it is to provide an equally agile tool to investigate _ multi - scale nonlinear _ problems such as those listed in the introduction . in this context , the linear accuracy of the model is of secondary importance compared to assuring the proper conservation laws and providing a qualitatively correct picture of the nonlinear energy transfers .",
    "it is worth noting , in this context , that a poisson bracket for a gyrokinetic model , demonstrating its hamiltonian nature , has only recently been constructed@xcite using the newly developed technique of gauge - free lifting.@xcite    uncertainty quantification ( uq ) provides another application for reduced models that is worth mentioning .",
    "the large number of inputs to gyrokinetic codes make comprehensive uq impractical , but the existence of a reduced model opens up new avenues for charting model sensitivities and subsequently using bayesian inference with a smaller number of runs of the gk code to selectively refine the predictions and reduce the error bars .",
