    "remarkably , quantum corrections to the cherenkov angle @xmath237 and the amplitude square are suppressed because the refractive index @xmath149 , for large photon momenta @xmath238 , behaves as @xmath239 , with @xmath25 the mass scale of the mcs theory .",

    "in addition , the effects of the charged particle s spin are not negligible and change the coefficient of the leading term of the radiation rate . since the radiated mcs photons are typically circularly polarized , effects of angular momentum nonconservation play a role .",

    "the three special cases discussed here give an idea of what a bound of the type may or may not imply for the coupling constants @xmath270 .",
