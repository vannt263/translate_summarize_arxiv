    "on may 24 , 1997 ( day 3743 after core collapse ) , sonneborn _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) observed supernova remnant ( snr ) 1987a with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "they discovered very broad ( @xmath4 ) ly@xmath1  emission in the ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter m98 ) interpreted this emission as the result of excitation of neutral hydrogen atoms in the supernova debris crossing a reverse shock .",
    "the observed ly@xmath1  flux was close to the value predicted by borkowski _",
    "( 1997 , hereafter b97 ) for such a model normalized to account for the soft x - ray flux observed by rosat .",
    "m98 also pointed out that the broad ly@xmath1  emission should be accompanied by h@xmath1  emission that should be observable both from the ground and with stis .",
    "the observations reported by sonneborn",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) were taken with a @xmath5 aperture that included the entire inner circumstellar ring of snr 1987a . with 24   arcsec@xmath6 dispersion ,",
    "the resulting ly@xmath1  image seen on the stis detector is a convolution of the spatial ( @xmath7 ) and velocity ( @xmath8 ) structure of the emitting region .",
    "m98 found that they could fit the observed image with a model in which the shock surface was a prolate ellipsoid slightly elongated in the direction normal to the ring plane , but they found evidence for an additional source of diffuse emission inside the shock surface .",
    "this result was surprising , because the model in b97 , following chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) , implies that most of the emission should come from a ring shaped surface inside the inner circumstellar ring .",
    "here we report a new set of stis observations of the fast shocks in snr 1987a , this time taken with slits covering only part of the emitting region and including h@xmath1  as well as ly@xmath1 .",
    "these new observations enable us to distinguish the dynamics and morphology of the fast shocks more clearly .",
    "we now see that the shock emission is indeed concentrated in the equatorial plane , contrary to our interpretation of the earlier stis observations .",
    "we also see a diffuse component of emission that may indicate excitation and ionization by nonthermal particles .",
    "we have not yet detected an unambiguous signal from high velocity nv @xmath9  emission .",
    "the same set of observations also provides new information on the spectra of the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar ring , including a rapidly brightening `` hot spot '' that is apparently caused by the first encounter of the supernova blast wave with the ring .",
    "we will interpret those data in subsequent papers .",
    "the supernova intensive study ( sins ) collaboration obtained stis spectra of snr 1987a in ultraviolet and optical wavelengths in september and october 1997 respectively .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum , which covers the wavelength range 1130  1720  , was taken on jd 2,450,719.1 , or 3869.3 days since explosion , with the g140l low dispersion grating ( @xmath10 at ly@xmath1 ) .",
    "the resolution along the spatial direction is @xmath11 .",
    "five spectral images totaling 11200 sec of exposure were combined .",
    "the optical spectrum , which covers the wavelength range 5260  10260  , was taken on jd 2,450,727.8 , or 3878.0 days since explosion , with the g750l low resolution grating ( @xmath12 at h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath13 .",
    "two spectral images totaling 4800 sec of exposure were obtained .",
    "the two images were dithered along the orientation of the slit so that both cosmic ray hits and hot pixels on the stis / ccd were removed simultaneously in the final combined data .",
    "figure [ fig1]a illustrates the slit positions on the inner circumstellar ring for the two observations .",
    "a @xmath14 slit was used for ly@xmath1  and a @xmath15 slit was used for h@xmath1 .",
    "both slits were offset @xmath16 to the se of the centroid of the ring , with position angles of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  observations , respectively .",
    "= 0.5    figure [ fig2]a shows the ultraviolet spectrum in the vicinity of ly@xmath1 .",
    "it displays the following components : ( 1 ) bright stationary geocoronal ly@xmath1  emission filling the slit ; ( 2 ) a nearly horizontal streak of intense blue - shifted ly@xmath1  emission below the centerline but inside the lower ( ne ) side of the ring extending to @xmath19 ; ( 3 ) a fainter horizontal streak of red - shifted emission above the centerline but inside the upper ( sw ) side of the ring extending to @xmath20 ; ( 4 ) a vertical band at @xmath21 due to diffuse , nv @xmath9  emission from nearly stationary nv ions in the vicinity of the ring ; and ( 5 ) a broad component of diffuse emission extending from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig2]c shows the optical spectrum in the vicinity of h@xmath1 .",
    "it displays the following components : ( 1 ) pairs of bright spots above and below the centerline due to emission by the nearly stationary inner ring at [ oi ] @xmath24 , [ nii ] @xmath25 , h@xmath1 , and [ sii ] @xmath26 ; ( 2 ) broad horizontal bands along the centerline due to emission in these same lines from atoms in the inner supernova debris excited by radioactivity ; and ( 3 ) a nearly horizontal streak of blue - shifted h@xmath1  emission below the centerline but inside the circumstellar ring extending to @xmath27 .",
    "according to b97 and m98 , we expect to see ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  emission from hi atoms in the supernova ejecta that are excited by electron and ion impacts as they cross a reverse shock .",
    "( we do not expect to see ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  emission from the blast wave because it is entering a region where the hydrogen atoms are already nearly fully ionized . )",
    "since the hi atoms are freely streaming , with radial velocity @xmath28 , before they cross the shock surface , the doppler shifts of the ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  are determined by the geometry of the surface .",
    "m98 inferred from the earlier stis observations that the reverse shock surface was a slightly prolate ellipsoid .",
    "for such a model , they predicted that a stis observation of ly@xmath1  through a @xmath14 slit would appear as an elliptical image ( their fig .",
    "1d ) .    the actual stis images of ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]a , c ) do not agree well with the prolate ellipsoid model for the reverse shock . instead , they agree better with the model proposed by b97 , in which the reverse shock emission is confined primarily to an equatorial band .",
    "we find also that the position and shape of the reverse shock surface vary from the far to the near side of the remnant , and probably on smaller scales as well .",
    "we can fit both the blue - shifted ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  observations with a model in which the shock on the near side has a radius which ranges from @xmath29 on the left side of the @xmath14 slit to @xmath30 on the right side of the slit and extends in latitude from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .    to fit the red - shifted ly@xmath1  observations ,",
    "the shock surface on the far side must have a radius @xmath33 and extend in latitude from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the red - shifted h@xmath1  emission was too faint to measure .",
    "figure [ fig1]b illustrates the reverse shock surface and its orientation in the slits for the ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  observations .",
    "the surface outside of the slits is not constrained by the present data and is shown only as an extrapolation .",
    "figures [ fig2]b , d show the resulting model ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  stis images , respectively",
    ". lines of constant latitude are shown on the simulated ly@xmath1  image assuming that all the emission comes from the center of the slit ( see  4 ) .",
    "comparison of the model ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1  images demonstrates the advantage of a narrow slit in mapping the shock surface .",
    "when we subtract the simulated images from the actual observations , the streaks vanish , leaving residual emission in the ly@xmath1  observation , which we discuss below in  4 .",
    "the measured flux from the ly@xmath1  shock emission is @xmath36 on the blue side and @xmath37 on the red side .",
    "the measured flux from the h@xmath1  shock emission is @xmath38 on the blue side and @xmath39 on the red side .",
    "the blue - shifted ly@xmath1  flux from the shock is greater than the red - shifted flux by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "if we assume that the outer sn debris is spherically symmetric with a power law density profile given by @xmath41 ( eastman &  kirshner 1989 ) , we can attribute this asymmetry to : the difference in shock radius ( which contributes a factor @xmath42 ) ; the fact that the reverse shock has a greater surface area on the near side ( a factor @xmath43 ) , and the @xmath44 year difference in light - travel time from the near side of the shock surface to the far side ( a factor @xmath45 ) .",
    "this asymmetry should not come as a great surprise .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the nonthermal radio emission seen inside the inner circumstellar ring was much brighter on the northeast side than on the southwest side .",
    "the asymmetry in the reverse shock surface is not caused by an asymmetry in the supernova debris because then the red - shifted ly@xmath1  emission would be brighter due to the higher mass flux ( ram pressure ) required to drive the shock to a greater radius .",
    "the asymmetry therefore represents an asymmetry in the circumstellar gas distribution which the ejecta is encountering ( the circumstellar gas on the far side must be more tenuous than the near side ) .",
    "m98 calculated that , for the conditions behind the reverse shock , approximately 1 ly@xmath1  and 0.2 h@xmath1  photons will be emitted per hi atom entering the shock .",
    "we can infer this emissivity ratio from the observations and our model , which allows us to correct for the fact that the ly@xmath1  observation is taken through a wider slit than the h@xmath1  observation . correcting for interstellar extinction factors of 0.15 at ly@xmath1  and 0.63 at h@xmath1  ( fitzpatrick _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) we find , on the blue - shifted side , where the h@xmath1  streak is bright enough to measure , this ratio to be @xmath46 , consistent with our expectation .",
    "since we know the number of ly@xmath1  photons emitted per hi atom crossing the shock surface , we can infer the normalization [ @xmath47 , the density at @xmath48 and @xmath49 years ] of the sn envelope s density profile from our model for the shock surface .",
    "estimating that the reverse shock is propagating outward with velocity @xmath50 ( b97 ) and assuming a helium number density @xmath51 , we find @xmath52 , which may be compared with shigeyama & nomoto s ( 1990 ) model 14e1 ( @xmath53 ) and woosley s ( 1988 ) model 10h ( @xmath54 ) . if we had taken the value of @xmath55 inferred from radio observations of the remnant ( gaensler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , @xmath47 would be decreased by @xmath56 .",
    "when we subtract the model images from the actual images , a diffuse component of high velocity ly@xmath1  emission remains . this component was evident in the earlier slitless observation by sonneborn _",
    "( 1998 ) , and led m98 to interpret those data with a model in which the reverse shock surface had the shape of a slightly prolate ellipsoid . now , with the present observations",
    ", we can see clearly that the ly@xmath1and h@xmath1  emission from the reverse shock is confined to the equatorial plane , and that the residual ly@xmath1  emission comes from a volume interior to that surface . a corresponding diffuse component of h@xmath1presumably exists , but it is too faint to be seen with the present exposure .    to analyze the distribution of the diffuse ly@xmath1  emission , we assume that the emitting gas is everywhere in free expansion .",
    "if so , and if the slit were very narrow , there would be a unique mapping from the stis image to depth within the supernova debris .",
    "from such a mapping , we could reconstruct a two - dimensional image of the supernova debris intercepted by the slit .",
    "figures [ fig3]a - c are just such images , where the coordinates are radius and latitude measured from the equatorial plane of the inner circumstellar ring .",
    "the curves of constant latitude are not radial lines because the slit is off - center .",
    "=    figure [ fig3]a represents the ly@xmath1  data of figure [ fig2]a in such a coordinate system , in which we assume that the slit is a line centered in the actual slit .",
    "since the actual slit has width @xmath14 , the mapping is not unique ; this introduces a `` point - spread function '' for the mapping represented approximately by the error circles in figures [ fig3]a - c .",
    "since we can not distinguish the contribution of red - shifted ly@xmath1  from that of nv @xmath9  with the present data , we can not interpret the signal on the lower right hand side of figure [ fig3]a .",
    "figure [ fig3]b represents the model for ly@xmath1  emission from the reverse shock surface corresponding to figure [ fig1]b , including the broadening due to the @xmath14 slit . in this coordinate system , we can see clearly that the blue - shifted ly@xmath1  emission comes from a reverse shock surface that lies primarily above the equatorial plane .",
    "figure [ fig3]c shows the residual flux on the blue side of ly@xmath1after subtracting the contribution from the reverse shock from the data .",
    "this diffuse ly@xmath1  emission comes from supernova debris inside the reverse shock surface and appears to have a roughly uniform radial distribution . like the ly@xmath1  emission from the reverse shock surface ,",
    "the diffuse ly@xmath1  emission is strongest within latitudes @xmath57 to @xmath58 ; but we see significant diffuse emission from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the flux of diffuse blue - shifted ly@xmath1  seen through the @xmath14 slit is @xmath61 , or @xmath62 times the flux of blue - shifted ly@xmath1  from the reverse shock .",
    "each pixel in the spectrum observes a volume element in the debris so we are able to measure the volume emissivity of the diffuse interior emission . correcting for interstellar extinction and assuming a distance of @xmath63 to the remnant we find this emissivity to be @xmath64 .    what causes this diffuse emission ?",
    "since it is concentrated in the same latitude range as the reverse shock emission , one is tempted to look at the reverse shock itself as the source of the excitation .",
    "we can rule out one obvious candidate  soft x - rays emitted by the shock  because the soft x - ray luminosity observed by rosat ( hasinger et al .",
    "1996 ) is roughly an order of magnitude too faint to account for the diffuse ly@xmath1 .",
    "likewise , the hot spot is still too faint to cause significant diffuse ly@xmath1  emission .",
    "we suspect that the diffuse ly@xmath1  emission is caused by nonthermal particles that are accelerated at the reverse shock and diffuse into the freely expanding supernova envelope . we know that such particles are present from observations of nonthermal radio emission ( gaensler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . the reverse shock may be a fairly efficient source of nonthermal particles ( jones &  ellison 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , those nonthermal particles that diffuse into the supernova envelope and deposit their energy may produce ly@xmath1  photons with efficiency approaching @xmath65 .",
    "further observations with stis will give us a much clearer picture of the complex dynamics and kinetics of this extraordinary event .",
    "it would be valuable to observe the system again in the same slit configurations to measure the rate of brightening in ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1emission from the shock surface .",
    "we should map the high velocity emission from the entire system , especially near the east side where the radio lobes are brightest .",
    "as m98 have emphasized , observations of the line profile of high velocity nv @xmath9  emission will provide a unique probe of the kinetics of a collisionless shock .",
    "we believe that the emission seen on the red side of ly@xmath1  contains a significant contribution from nv @xmath9 , but we can not distinguish this emission from ly@xmath1  emission in the present observations . to do that , we must observe the high velocity emission from the same part of snr 1987a with stis in both ly@xmath1  and h@xmath1 .",
    "the exposure should be deep enough to see the diffuse emission clearly in h@xmath1  as well as ly@xmath1 , and the slit should be narrow in order to separate the spatial structure from the velocity structure and to isolate the nv @xmath9  emission from stationary gas . then , since the ratio of ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  should be constant , we would be able to subtract the h@xmath1image from the ly@xmath1  image , leaving a remainder that is due to nv @xmath9 .",
