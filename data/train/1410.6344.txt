    "quantum dots are nanoscopic artificial structures , somehow created within solid state devices , that contain a small number of charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) , and display quantum behaviour in the same manner that atoms or molecules do  @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is relatively easy to isolate even one single electron .",
    "the precise control over charge and currents on quantum dots was soon achieved and demonstrated , whereas the experimental techniques to measure and manipulate the spins followed later on  @xcite .",
    "these developments have contributed to the growth of the field of _ spintronics _",
    "@xcite , which consists of the control and manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom in solid state devices .    among the many foreseen applications of quantum",
    "dot based spintronics is quantum information processing : the spin of a single electron is the most typical example of a two - level system , and this fact soon suggested the possibility of using single - electron quantum dots as a physical realization of a _ qubit _  @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this to be conceivable is the long decoherence times observed for the spin degree of freedom in common quantum dots  @xcite ( other reason is the realization , at least at the level of proof - of - principle , of the devincenzo s criteria  @xcite ) .",
    "this decoherence time is to be compared with the time required for an _ operation _ ,",
    "i.e. the typical time used to change the state of the system in a controlled manner , with an external field .",
    "it is therefore essential to have a means to produce very fast operation times , specially since fault - tolerant operations require multiple possible manipulations within the coherence time .    in order to induce a spin flip in these systems ,",
    "one can of course use a time - dependent magnetic field , oscillating at the zeeman transition frequency ; the rabi oscillations will eventually induce full transitions from one state to another .",
    "this procedure is called `` electron spin resonance '' ( esr ) . however , this method is not particularly fast , and moreover it is not easy to produce and localize these magnetic fields individually on each quantum dot . recently ,",
    "the alternative use of electric fields has also been proposed and demonstrated  @xcite , since these can indirectly couple to the spin , for example through spin - orbit coupling .",
    "an electric field may be produced locally on chip through appropriate gates , or one may attempt optical manipulation via a thz laser pulse , which has the advantage of a very high frequency , and therefore promise very fast spin rotations .    in this work",
    "we will focus on this second option , the optical manipulation of spins  or , in any case , the use of high frequency electric fields , whatever its origin .",
    "the action of thz optical fields on quantum dots , and its coupling to the spin degree of freedom thorough spin - orbit coupling , has already been theoretically investigated for example by jiang et al .",
    "@xcite in this work , we inquire into how fast can a single spin in a quantum dot rotate when manipulated with a thz electric field , through the indirect coupling facilitated by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we will not limit the allowed external fields to quasi - mono - chromatic laser pulses ( that are typically tuned to some resonant frequency ) , but rather consider the possibility of shaping the temporal shape of the pulse , in order to find a path that produces the transition in a faster way than following rabi s oscillations . in order to find the shape that produces the optimal result , we will use quantum optimal control theory ( qoct )  @xcite .",
    "this theory provides a set of techniques to find the best external fields that , acting on a quantum system , produce the evolution that is optimal in a certain sense defined by the user .",
    "we have implemented qoct in the real - space , real - time , electronic structure code octopus  @xcite .",
    "this code focuses on the time - dependent many - electron problem , based on time - dependent density - functional theory  @xcite , although in this case this feature is not necessary since we deal with a single - electron problem .",
    "this implementation of qoct has already been employed in recent years to study dynamics of 2d quantum dots and rings in the presence of thz laser fields  @xcite . by including in the model a spin - orbit coupling term ( in this case",
    ", we have chosen the rashba term  @xcite , although this choice is not important for the conclusions that follow ) , we have learned what are the typical transition velocities that one may expect when manipulating the spin of a single electron quantum dot with this kind of electric fields .",
    "the goal has been to construct optimal laser pulses that drive a single - electron spin from a given initial orientation in the bloch sphere to any other _",
    "target _ spin orientation . within qoct",
    ", such physical goals have to be mathematically formalized with the definition of a `` target function '' that determines the degree of success achieved for the task that is pursued . in this work we have considered two possible target definitions : the first one corresponds to the projection into some pre - defined spin orientation :",
    "the control is exerted on the orientation of spin without specifying a priori which stationary states are involved .",
    "the second target corresponds to the transition from the ground state , which is known to have a dominant spin in one particular direction , to an excited eigenstate that has a dominant spin in an approximately opposite direction .",
    "we consider the quantum dots fabricated on top of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) that can be locked at the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "the most common case is perhaps that of the gaas / algaas heterostructure , and therefore we will consider this material in the following .",
    "the algaas layer is usually doped with si , which results in the liberation of free electrons , that accumulate at the gaas / algaas interface , and are trapped in a thin ( around 10  nm ) layer . the electronic system",
    "can then be considered to occupy a thin potential well in the direction perpendicular to the interface plane ( hereafter , the @xmath0-direction ) .",
    "this thinness ( to be compared to the fermi wave length of the electrons , large due to the low electronic density ) is the reason for the 2d character of the system , as the electrons can be considered to occupy only the lowest subband  at the low temperature that are necessary for these experiments to take place .",
    "once the 2deg is thus created , one may further constrain electrons in the @xmath1 plane , by placing _ gates _ ( metal electrodes ) on top of the semiconductor , and controlling their voltages .    the electronic islands created in this manner ( the _ quantum dots _ ) can then be modeled by considering an effective mass approximation in 2d , and assuming simple and smooth confining potentials in the @xmath1 plane - typically , as we will do below , of parabolic form . in addition , one may have an external magnetic field , a time - dependent external electric field ( originated by the variation of the potential applied on the gates , or by a laser source ) , and , as we will crucially consider in this work , one or more spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) terms .",
    "there are various forms of soc that can be present in this kind of zincblende materials .",
    "the bulk crystal lacks inversion symmetry , which leads to the dresselhaus term  @xcite , and in addition the heterojunction produces a structural inversion asymmetry along the growth direction that results in the rashba term  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the rashba effect can in fact be tailored with the application of external electric fields applied in parallel to the growth direction .",
    "because of this tunability , we have chosen to work exclusively with this rashba term , which is in many circumstances the dominant one  @xcite . however",
    ", the qualitative conclusions that we will draw out do not depend on this choice : these soc terms couple to the external electric fields in a similar manner .",
    "after all these considerations , the system can be modeled , in the absence of external time - dependent electric pulses , with the following static effective hamiltonian : @xmath2_z + \\frac{g^*}{2}\\mu_b \\left(\\hat{\\bm{\\sigma}}\\times\\bm{b}\\right)_z~~\\text{.}\\ ] ] the first term corresponds to the electron kinetic energy , where @xmath3 is the electron effective mass that we consider to be @xmath4 in a gaas semiconductor medium ( @xmath5 is the electron mass ) .",
    "the vector potential @xmath6 included in that term generates the static homogeneous magnetic field @xmath7 , normal to the @xmath1-plane where the system is confined . the second term",
    ", @xmath8 is the confinement potential .",
    "the third term correspond to the rashba soc , whereas the fourth is the zeeman term . in those expressions , @xmath9 is the vector of pauli matrices , @xmath10 is the rashba parameter that determines the soc strength , @xmath11 is the effective gyromagnetic factor ( we will use @xmath12 for gaas ) , and @xmath13 is the bohr magneton .    for the confinement potential , we have used @xmath14  mev , which is in the range of the typical values in common experimental realizations of qds . a rough corresponding estimate of the qd lateral extension is approximately @xmath15  nm , which also lies within the typical range of sizes for lithographically etched and gate - confined qds . in the following , we will express all the quantities in _ effective atomic units _ , that relate to usual atomic units ( defined by setting @xmath16 ) in the following manner : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the usual atomic units of length , energy , and time , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is @xmath24 for gaas .    in the presence of an external electric pulse ,",
    "the previous hamiltonian must be supplemented with a time - dependent term , and the system is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger s equation during a time interval [ 0 , t ] : @xmath25\\psi(\\bm{r},t)\\,,\\ ] ] where the electron - field interaction assumes the dipole approximation in the length gauge , being @xmath26 the dipole operator .",
    "the time - dependent electric field , @xmath27 is linearly polarized in some direction determined by the unit vector @xmath28 , contained in the @xmath1-plane .",
    "the precise direction is in fact irrelevant due to the circular symmetry of the rest of the hamiltonian .",
    "the specification of @xmath29 , together with an initial value condition , determines the full evolution of the system , via the propagation of schrdinger s equation .",
    "the questions that we wish to answer are the following : is it possible , by fine - tuning the form of @xmath29 , to manipulate at will the spin state of the system in a controllable manner ? how fast can this manipulation be performed , as a function of the characteristics of the system  the soc strength , the presence and magnitude of the external static magnetic field , etc . ?",
    "optimal control is a suitable tool to address this type of questions , reformulating them into the following problem : given a _",
    "target _ , defined as the maximization of a functional of the final state of the system ( or of its evolution ) , what is the time - dependent control function that best accomplishes it ?",
    "in our case , the target must obviously be related to the spin state of the system , whereas the control function is the time - dependent electric field @xmath29 .",
    "the set of possible control functions is the search space for the optimization algorithm . in practice",
    ", the control function must be discretized in order to proceed with the numerical computations : a set of parameters @xmath30 determines the shape of the function : @xmath31(t)$ ] , and therefore the domain of the parameters @xmath32 is the effective search space .",
    "regarding the target , it is typically defined through the expectation value of some operator @xmath33 , i.e. it is a functional of the final state of the system with the form : @xmath34 = \\langle \\psi(t)\\vert\\hat{o}\\vert\\psi(t)\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] since the parameters @xmath32 determine the shape of the control function , which in turns determines the evolution of the system , @xmath35 $ ] , the problem is reduced to the maximization of a function of @xmath32 : @xmath36 = f[\\psi[{\\bf u } ] ] = \\langle \\psi[{\\bf      u}](t)\\vert\\hat{o}\\vert\\psi[{\\bf u}](t)\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] this maximization is greatly eased if we have a feasible scheme to compute the gradient of this function , and this is provided by qoct : @xmath37 =   2\\text{im}\\;\\int_0^t\\!\\!{\\rm d}t\\;\\langle\\chi\\left[{\\bf u}\\right](t)\\vert\\;\\nabla_{\\bf    u}\\hat{h}[{\\bf u}](t)\\;\\vert \\psi\\left[{\\bf u}\\right](t)\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] note that , given the structure of our hamiltonian : @xmath38(t ) =   ( \\hat{\\bm{r}}\\cdot \\bm{\\pi } ) \\nabla_{\\bf u } \\varepsilon[{\\bf u}](t)\\ ] ] also note that a new auxiliary wave function @xmath39(t)$ ] has appeared ; it is defined as the solution of :    @xmath40(\\bm{r},t ) =   \\hat{h}^{\\dag}[{\\bf u}](t)\\chi[{\\bf u}](\\bm{r},t)~\\text { , and}\\ ] ]    @xmath41(\\bm{r},t ) = \\hat{o}\\psi[{\\bf u}]({\\bf r},t)\\,.\\ ] ]    these equations are similar to the equations for the true wave function @xmath42 $ ] , except for the fact that the boundary condition ( eq . ) is given at the final time @xmath43 , which implies that @xmath39 $ ] must be propagated backwards .",
    "therefore , the computation of the gradient of @xmath44 , that requires of both wave functions , is computed by first propagating eq .   forward in time and then eq .   backward .",
    "finally , the maxima of @xmath44 are found at the critical points @xmath45 ; in order to find these maxima we use the quasi - newton method designed by broyden , fletcher , goldfarb and shanno  @xcite .    it remains to specify the target operator , and the parameterization of the control functions . regarding the former , we consider two types of targets :    target a : : :    the goal is to maximize the spin projection onto some direction    @xmath46 , i.e. the operator @xmath33 is    defined as : @xmath47for    example",
    ", if @xmath48 , and @xmath49 the    goal is to maximize the @xmath0 spin projection .",

    "in addition , we enforce a _ fixed fluence condition _ :",
    "@xmath55(t ) = f_0\\,.\\ ] ] the idea is to find the optimal field within the set of fields with equal integrated intensity  this is the physical meaning of the fluence .",

    "the electronic levels undergo an energy shift due to the soc .",
    "this displacement is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the soc also lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states with the same orbital momenta ( those with equal @xmath65 ) .",
    "the separation between these previously degenerate states is also proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath62 , the energy levels remain doubly degenerate in spin ( kramer s degeneracy ) .    when a magnetic field is present ( @xmath56 t [ fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( b ) ] ) , the usual zeeman splitting appears .",
    "but in addition to this , we can observe the effect of the soc : an @xmath10-dependent spin splitting .",
    "as we increase the rashba soc strength , this splitting gives raise to an approach of energy levels with opposite magnetic moments .",
    "note , however , that due to the soc , the electronic states are no longer pure spin spin - up and spin - down states ( in other words , @xmath66 is no more a good quantum number ) .",
    "therefore , the labeling @xmath61 in figs .  [ fig-1](a ) and  [ fig-1](b ) must be understood only in terms of the spin - branches of each electronic state .",

    "[ fig-2](a ) , lifting spin degeneracy even at vanishingly small magnetic field .",
    "in addition , new crossings of several of the energy levels at low magnetic field regime appears , as well as anti - crossings at higher magnetic field strengths .",
    "these anti - crossings occur between neighbouring quantum levels with opposite magnetic moments  @xcite .    in the following sections",
    ", we will analyze the optimization calculations .",
    "as described above , these optimizations are iterative algorithms , and must depart from an initial electric pulse .",

    "the expectation value of @xmath76 is positive ( if no magnetic field is present , the ground state is two - fold degenerate in spin , and then we choose the branch with positive @xmath77 ) .",

    "when using a target of type a , we set @xmath78 , and @xmath49 . for target",

    "we have explored the time scales necessary to perform spin transformations , making use of optimized laser pulse shapes , found with the help of quantum optimal control theory .",
    "these time scales depend on the strength of the spin - orbit coupling , and of the presence or absence of an external magnetic field , helpful to fix a value for the initial spin orientation .    the search for an optimal pulse , within qoct , can be done in multiple ways , and the first choice to make is the design of a target functional . we have shown results for two types of targets . in the first type ,",
    "the functional only depends on the spin projection value , without placing explicit restrictions on the number of the qd eigenstates which can participate in the representation of the final state .",
    "the results show full spin rotations in about 1 or 2 ps , depending on the value of the spin - orbit coupling . in the second type of target ,",
    "the spin control is achieved indirectly through the control of a particular transition between the ground state and an excited state which has the desired spin orientation . in this case , if the target transition involves one of the lowest excited states , the pulse length must be at least an order of magnitude greater than those used in the case of the first target .    in conclusion ,",

    "<S> we have studied theoretically the possibility of ultra - fast manipulation of a single electron spin in 2d semiconductor quantum dots , by means of high - frequency time - dependent electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin degree of freedom is excited through spin - orbit coupling , and the procedure may be enhanced by the presence of a static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we use quantum optimal control theory to tailor the temporal profile of the electric field in order to achieve the most effective manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme predicts significant control over spin operations in times of the order of picoseconds  an ultrafast time scale that permits to avoid the effects of decoherence if this scheme is to be used as a tool for quantum information processing . </S>"
