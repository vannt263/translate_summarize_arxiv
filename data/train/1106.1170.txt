    "the spiral arms of our galaxy have been typically characterised by radio observations of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen , giant hii regions , co emission , and optical data of young o and b stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "used fir and nir emission from the cobe / dirbe to fit a model for the spiral arms in the stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite , based on infrared data from the spitzer / glimpse survey , and @xcite , using trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers in high - mass star - forming regions , reported new results about the spiral structure of the milky way ( mw ) . despite the effort ,",
    "there are still several caveats in the spiral arm properties in our galaxy , such as pattern speed , strength , orientation and even the number of arms or their stellar or gaseous structure .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the spiral arms themselves , i.e. their origin or their lifetime , are nowadays a matter of debate ( @xcite ) .    apart from direct methods to detect spiral arm over - densities , an alternative method is based on the analysis of kinematic groups that are induced by the spiral arms in the local velocity distribution .",
    "some of the moving groups in the solar neighbourhood were originally thought to be remnants of disrupted disc stellar clusters .",
    "however , the age or metallicity distribution of their stars are in contradiction with this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that a moving group could be a group of stars that crosses the solar neighbourhood following a certain type of orbit induced by the galactic bar gravitational potential .",
    "the demonstration that the bar resonances can produce a kinematic group , similar to the observed hercules group @xcite , has lead to the exploration of similar effects on the velocity distribution due to the spiral arms ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this type of kinematic structures could depend strongly on some characteristics of the bar and spiral arms and , therefore , they result useful for our understanding of the mw large - scale structure and dynamics in its present and past form .",
    "few studies , however , have focused on the spiral arm effects on the disc velocity distribution . by integration of test particle orbits",
    ", @xcite showed that few , but intense stochastic spiral density waves produce structures which are arranged in branches , resembling those from observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a method to quantify , through orbital integration , the velocity distribution that would result from the existence of spiral - induced families of periodic orbits in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "they found , for models with the sun in the outer limits of the 4:1 resonance and certain spiral arm orientation , two periodic orbits in the kinematic positions of coma berenices and hyades  pleiades .",
    "the test particle simulations by @xcite showed that the combined effect of a bar and 4 weak spiral arms , is necessary to reproduce the main local moving groups ( hercules , hyades , pleiades , coma berenices and sirius ) . in the spiral - only models , more structures but less bold than those with the bar simulations",
    "were obtained .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that the angle - action variables of the stars in the hyades stream could be consistent with the effects of a recent inner lindblad resonance of a multi - arm ( number of arms @xmath4 ) and transient pattern .",
    "all this work has shown that the spiral arms are able to induce kinematic groups in the local velocity distribution . however , there is no study that explores the influence of each spiral arm property using potential models designed according to the latest observational evidences for the mw spiral structure . on top of that",
    ", previous studies have modelled the spiral arm potential with a cosine function , following the tight - winding approximation ( twa , e.g. @xcite ) . however , it is not clear to us whether the mw spiral arms satisfy the conditions for self - consistency of this model , in particular , regarding their tightness and weakness .",
    "moreover , the twa implies that the spiral arms are a steady global mode of the disc but , as mentioned , it is still a matter of discussion whether the spiral arms are long - lived or transient structures .    motivated by the recent picture of the mw spiral arms and the possibility that the twa is not suitable for our galaxy , we study the spiral arm effects on the solar vicinity kinematics with the twa but also a different model , namely the perlas model @xcite .",
    "this is a 3d mass distribution from which more abrupt gravitational potential and the forces are derived .",
    "as proved in @xcite , this difference has far - reaching consequences on the gaseous dynamical behaviour .",
    "differences in the stellar response are expected too . in @xcite",
    "we presented a preliminary study of the kinematic effects of this model . here",
    "we aim to determine the conditions that favour the appearance of kinematic groups such as the ones that we observe near the sun .",
    "we explore the influence of the spiral properties and discuss to which extent we can use the kinematic imprints to constrain the spiral arm properties and nature .",
    "we also compare the local kinematic imprints of the perlas model with the ones of the twa to see whether these imprints are useful to test the spiral arm gravitational potential modelling .",
    "to do this , we first tune these two models to the latest observational determinations for the properties of the mw spiral arms .",
    "for some properties only a range of evidence is available in the literature .",
    "then we perform test particle simulations with both models considering these ranges , different initial conditions and integration times .",

    "we elaborate on the gravitational potential modelling of the spiral arms .",

    "maps of ob - associations and hii - regions , co emission , masers in high - mass star - forming regions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) show a 4-armed pattern , usually referred as sagittarius  carina , scutum  centaurus ( or scutum  crux ) , perseus and the outer ( or cygnus ) arms .",
    "however , according to cobe k - band observations @xcite and to the infrared spitzer / glimpse survey @xcite , only two of these four arms are major mw arms .",

    "also hydrodynamic models have shown that it is possible to form arms of compressed gas , without increasing the stellar surface density , as a response to a 2-armed pattern @xcite . here",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite consider that the stellar arm counterpart of scutum ",
    "centaurus is the perseus arm . but",
    "according to the model by @xcite , the counterpart goes far beyond the perseus arm in the anti - centre direction .",
    "because of these discrepancies , we will adopt two different locus : the one reported by @xcite ( hereafter locus 1 , solid black curve in fig .",

    "the spiral arms are added as an mass enhancement to the axisymmetric background on the imposed locus .",
    "because of this , for the perlas model the mass of the spiral arms ( @xmath8 ) is globally subtracted from the original disc of the a&s model ( @xmath9 ) , which guarantees that the total mass of the model do not change and neither does the mean circular velocity .",

    "the arm half - width and height above the plane are taken to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , according to the analysis of a sample of external galaxies @xcite and the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the perlas spiral arms and the twa falls on the construction itself . in the twa , the spiral arms are a small perturbative term of the potential .",
    "this produces a cancellation of the contribution from the distant parts of the pattern to the local force .",
    "the perlas spiral arms correspond to an independent mass distribution .",

    "some of the modes could be corotating with the bar at the bar s end , or coupled with the bar through their respective resonances .",

    "few studies have focused on the spiral arm effects on the local velocity distribution . moreover , all of them modelled the spiral arm potential following the twa .",
    "we have seen that , despite being uncertain , the observational evidences for the mw arms density contrast , and especially , the pitch angle , suggest that the assumptions for self - consistency of the twa in the mw case are , at least , doubtfully satisfied .",
    "here we have studied the spiral arm effects on the kinematics of the solar neighbourhood with the twa but also with a different spiral arm model , the perlas model . while in the twa ,",
    "the spiral arms are a small perturbative term of the potential , modelled as a cosine function , the perlas spiral arms correspond to an independent 3d mass distribution , from which the gravitational forces are derived .",
    "we have seen that both radial and tangential forces of this model present more abrupt features and different disc locations for the minima , maxima and 0 points .    here",
    "we aimed to determine the conditions that favour the appearance of kinematic groups , such as the ones that we observe in the solar neighbourhood . to do this ,",
    "first we have tuned these two models to the latest observational determinations for the properties of the mw spiral arms . for many of these properties only a certain range of evidence",
    "could be established .",
    "next , we have performed test particle simulations with both models considering these ranges , different initial conditions and integration times .",
    "our analysis indicates that :    1 .   a significant part of the allowed parameter space , especially for the perlas model , favours the triggering of kinematic groups with different shapes , sizes and inclinations , such as the observed ones in the solar neighbourhood",
    "this shows that it is feasible that some of the observed moving groups have a dynamical origin related with the spiral arms .",
    "the velocity distribution is certainly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and , especially , to the pattern speed .",
    "changes in the kinematic groups are significant if one moves only @xmath1 in radius .",
    "but the @xmath55@xmath56 plane changes more slowly with azimuth and @xmath100 are needed in this direction to detect important differences . due to this",
    ", the pattern speed could be better constrained using the observed kinematic groups ( within an error of @xmath134 ) than the relative spiral phase ( with a precision of @xmath135 ) .",
    "however , one would need to break the degeneracy mentioned below by other means such as reducing the free parameter space .",
    "3 .   for both models and for all density contrasts , within the observational mw range , the spiral",
    "arms induce strong imprints for pattern speeds around @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to regions close to the 4:1 inner resonance .",
    "no substructure at all is induced close to corotation or high order resonances ( @xmath111 ) , which corresponds to pattern speeds of 20.5 to 30 @xmath105 .",
    "changes in spiral strength produce no significant differences in most cases , which makes difficult to constrain this parameter .",
    "some groups in the extremes of the @xmath55@xmath56 plane are only populated for the maximum density contrast case , which could help to establish the spiral strength .",
    "the effects of a different pitch angle seem difficult to differentiate given the observational range for this parameter .",
    "the spiral arms induce groups in a large region of the @xmath55@xmath56 plane , including the low @xmath56 part .",
    "for instance , the arms , and not only the bar , can crowd the region of the hercules group .",
    "previous studies associated the spiral arm influence mainly to the central parts of the @xmath55@xmath56 plane , and the bar to low angular momentum structures , such as hercules @xcite . 6 .",
    "the kinematic groups that are dynamically induced by the spiral arms depend on integration time .",
    "the time of appearance is different for each group , ranging from 0 to 1200 @xmath92 .",
    "the structures at the extreme parts of the @xmath55@xmath56 plane require more integration time , i.e. a larger spiral lifetime .",
    "the early appearance of some groups demonstrates that even recent spiral arms ( @xmath136 ) may produce strong kinematic structures .",
    "structures also change shape , size and position in the @xmath55@xmath56 plane until a maximum time of @xmath113 , when the @xmath55@xmath56 plane becomes stationary . 7",
    "each of the structures seen in the @xmath55@xmath56 plane is composed by particles with a wide range of integration times and a different minimum time .",
    "this is encouraging as the study of the stellar ages in the observed moving groups also reveal similar characteristics . for instance , see evolution in the sirius and hyades groups particularly for stars younger than @xmath68 ( fig . 13 in @xcite ) or the wide age distribution and different minimum age in a particular group ( fig .",
    "14 in @xcite ) . 8 .",
    "models obtained from our simulations with the spiral arms that reproduce the local observed velocity distribution are degenerated .",
    "groups such as the ones that are observed in the solar neighbourhood can be induced by different model parameter combinations .",
    "for instance , several models create groups such as hyades , pleiades or sirius .",
    "9 .   in most of our simulations where both the spiral arms and the bar are included , individual imprints of the bar and the arms can still be identified in the final velocity distributions .",
    "this means that using simulations with spiral - only model is a valid first step to understand the isolated kinematic effects of this non - axisymmetric component .",
    "the stellar response near solar positions of the twa spiral arms and the perlas model is significantly different , both in configuration space and kinematics .",
    "both models are able to induce several kinematic groups but the velocity distributions and the groups are rather different .",
    "the perlas model gives more substructure than the twa given the same density contrast , and more substructure for a larger pattern speed range or , equivalently , a larger radius range .",
    "for the perlas model and both the maximum and minimum density contrast , we see clear and rich kinematic substructure near solar azimuth for pattern speeds from 15 to 19.5 @xmath105 ( regions near the inner 3:1 , 4:1 and 5:1 resonances ) . by contrast , this pattern speed range is smaller for the twa model even in the high density contrast case . on the other hand ,",
    "for the minimum density contrast , the twa model induces some substructure only for a narrow range of pattern speeds ( around 16.718 @xmath105 ) .    to conclude , the spiral arms induce strong imprints on the velocity distributions at solar regions and that these are sensitive to some arm properties .",
    "these indicate that kinematics can be used as one of the constraints on the current uncertainty about spiral structure of our galaxy , e.g. , in the pattern speed , strength , orientation and lifetime .",
    "the local distribution function is significantly sensitive to the used model , even if they are adjusted to reproduce the same observational constraints for the spiral structure of the mw .",
    "this stresses the importance of the specific spiral arm gravitational potential modelling for the mw studies , as this can induce significant deviations on their orbital dynamics .",
    "it is promising that the kinematic structures can help to improve this modelling or to test whether the mw spiral arms are weak and tightly wound , following the twa .",
    "the constraint of the mw spiral structure properties , however , is presently not straightforward .",
    "this is due , first , to the mentioned degeneracy .",
    "our simulations have shown that the parameters space is still too large to obtain a unique fitting to the observed velocity distribution .",
    "second , the uncertainty in the solar motion propagates to the velocities of the observed groups , making the fitting between observations and simulations imprecise .",
    "the problem is complex as , precisely , the presence of kinematic substructure complicates the solar motion determination .",
    "third , for this constraint we should take into account the other processes that have influenced and sculpted the real velocity distributions ( other non - axisymmetries , external accretion effects , dispersion by giant molecular clouds , etc ) . as an example , we have identified effects due to the combination of bar and spiral arms .",
    "for instance , structures that appear centred in the @xmath55 axis in the spiral - only models are shifted to negative @xmath55 due to the combined action , inducing a group similar to the observed hercules structure .",
    "nevertheless , none of the existing current galaxy models is complex enough to include all these processes at the same time .    to break the degeneracy and use the kinematic groups to constrain the mw large scale structure , a smaller parameter space for the spiral properties and/or data from velocity distributions at different positions of the mw disc are needed . with the increase of knowledge on the mw structure and evolution",
    ", we will have to cope with a more complex scenario and a variety of processes that can play a role in the formation of moving groups .",
    "future models will be more realistic but more complex to interpret .",
    "besides , while now the spatial study of the observed moving groups is limited by the extension and precision of the current observational samples , this will soon change with the advent of data from new surveys ( usno , ucac3 , 2mass , rave , segue , panstars , lamost , gaia ) .",
    "explorations of the spiral arm effects like the present study will help us to interpret more sophisticated future models as well as velocity distributions in nearby regions coming from surveys such as gaia .",
