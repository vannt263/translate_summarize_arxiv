    "rather turbulence is generated at the upstream front and then decays continuously as fluid parcels pass to the downstream front @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at high reynolds numbers slugs have a spatially extended bulk region between the upstream and downstream fronts , and in the bulk region turbulence shows no significant spatial variation , indicating that the interior part of slugs is in a persistent turbulent state ( see figure  [ fig : puff_slug]c ) . in their seminal experimental work @xcite investigated the energy budget of slugs .",
    "their measurements above reynolds number 4200 ( at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 based on the bulk velocity @xmath9 and pipe diameter @xmath10 ) showed that the upstream and downstream fronts of slugs have a similar , well - defined structure .",
    "they observed that within the bulk region there is sufficient turbulent kinetic energy production to sustain turbulence and hence that the bulk region corresponds to that of fully turbulent pipe flow .",
    "@xcite conducted detailed direct numerical simulations of slug formation and noted that slugs take multiple forms as manifested by different downstream front structures . at moderate reynolds numbers slugs have diffusive downstream fronts , not unlike the downstream fronts observed for puffs ( see figure [ fig : puff_slug]b ) , whereas at high reynolds numbers the downstream fronts are sharper , with a well - defined structure similar in intensity to the upstream fronts ( see figure [ fig : puff_slug]c ) .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "the focus of the current work is the distinction between weak and strong slugs .",
    "although the dynamics of weak and strong fronts was described within a model system , further study of real pipe flow is essential to elucidate the physical mechanisms distinguishing them .",
    "the issues are the following .",
    "firstly , the model is only one dimensional , whereas in reality fronts are evolving in a highly complicated fashion and are spatially convoluted @xcite .",
    "this complexity results from three dimensionality of the interface and intrinsic turbulent fluctuations and that can not be fully captured by the one - dimensional model .",
    "hence it is important to compare model fronts with those from full simulations of the navier  stokes equations .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , the model assumes certain physical properties of turbulent pipe flow that we establish as facts for the first time in the present work .",
    "specifically , here we carry out extensive direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier  stokes equations to analyse the physics of the laminar - turbulent fronts of slugs . through the analysis we elucidate the key distinction between weak and strong fronts , both in terms of the kinetic energy budget across the fronts and in terms of front motion relative to the advection speed turbulent structures within the bulk .",
    "for the numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations , we have used the pipe flow code of @xcite , based on the description in @xcite .",
    "simulations are started from a single localised disturbance in the form of a turbulent puff .",
    "the flow is then left to evolve naturally into an expanding slug . in order to obtain statistics ,",
    "we generate a sample of slugs ( typically 20 at each @xmath16 ) by using different initial disturbances .",
    "the numerical resolutions for the simulations performed here are the same as in table  1 of the extended data of @xcite .    in principle the simulations",
    "could be initiated in multiple ways , for example , by a forcing that mimics wall injection in the laboratory experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) , or by perturbing laminar flow with localised pair of streamwise rolls ( e.g. @xcite ) . in our case ,",
    "the initial conditions are all taken to be snapshots from turbulent puff simulations at a fixed reynolds number ( @xmath17 ) , so that initial conditions resemble the snapshots shown in figure  [ fig : puff_slug](a ) . in this way all initial conditions are already fully nonlinear turbulent states of nearly identical streamwise extent and amplitude .",
    "such initial conditions always transform rapidly into slugs in simulations at higher reynolds number .",
    "the initial transients corresponding to the transformation into slugs are excluded from the analysis . then 150 to 500 snapshots of each expanding slug are recorded .",
    "( we used a @xmath18-long pipe with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction for all simulations .",
    "the number of snapshots depends on how quickly the slug length grows and fills the whole domain .",
    "hence the number decreases with increasing @xmath0 . ) for further details , see @xcite . for the phase - plane plots that appear in  [ sec : sleeping_cap ] , we re - analyse the same data set generated by @xcite who used the data to obtain the front speeds shown in figure  [ fig : puff_slug](d ) . for the the energy budget analysis in  [ sec : energy ] and for the advection speeds computations in  [ sec : advection ] , further computations have been performed using the same computational techniques .    from the dns data , we use @xmath19 as an indicator of the local turbulence intensity along the pipe axis , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are radial , azimuthal , and axial coordinates , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the radial and azimuthal velocity components , ( non - dimensionalised by the bulk velocity @xmath9 ) .    as proposed by @xcite the turbulence intensity , @xmath6 , and the axial centreline velocity , @xmath25 ,",
    "provide a convenient and compact characterisation of the state of the flow . for fully developed laminar flow @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "while for a turbulent flow , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the lower value of @xmath30 in the turbulent case results from a plug - like velocity profile corresponding to a lower mean shear in the turbulent state .",
    "because turbulent slugs are not fixed structures but expand over time , for our analysis it is necessary to divide a turbulent slug into three parts : upstream front , _ bulk _ , and downstream front ( see figure  [ fig : sleepingcap_calculation ] )",
    ". a position for the laminar - turbulent fronts can be defined by setting a threshold in @xmath6 above which the flow is considered as turbulent .",
    "we have used the threshold value @xmath31 , but we have verified that none the results that are to follow are sensitive to the precise value of the threshold , for a substantial range of values .",
    "the upstream and downstream front regions are then taken to be of fixed streamwise extent ( @xmath32 ) , while the size of the bulk region varies with time . the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath30",
    "is numerically obtained separately in each of the three regions . to remove the effect of fluctuations and determine the mean dynamics of the fronts , we compute average over time ( the saved snapshots ) and the ensemble of runs .",

    "referring to figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap](a ) , starting from the parabolic laminar flow on the upstream side , there is a sharp increase in turbulence intensity @xmath6 across the upstream front while the centreline velocity @xmath30 remains almost unchanged .",
    "this is as expected since the modification of the mean shear must respond to the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "this rise in @xmath6 occurs both for slugs and for puffs . for puffs",
    "the rise is rather moderate ( see the cyan curve for @xmath17 in figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap]a ) , while for slugs , the rise is both larger and steeper . for slugs ,",
    "the value of @xmath30 decreases by less than 5   rise of @xmath6 , in agreement with the measurements of @xcite . following this sharp jump in @xmath6 ,",
    "the centreline velocity @xmath30 decreases , corresponding to a blunting of the shear profile in response to the high level of turbulence excitations .",
    "subsequently , both @xmath30 and @xmath6 gradually level off in the bulk part of the structure shown with points in the phase plot .",
    "the constant levels of @xmath6 and @xmath30 in the bulk indicate that turbulence production and dissipation are in balance .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath30 and @xmath6 indicated by points are identical to those obtained from simulations of fully turbulent pipe flow at the corresponding reynolds number .",
    "while the structure of the upstream front does not vary much with @xmath0 , the structure of the downstream front does .",
    "the distinction between weak and strong downstream fronts is quite evident in the phase - plane plot . at @xmath4 and @xmath35 ,",
    "as one traverses the downstream front , @xmath6 decreases almost monotonically from the bulk region towards zero at the downstream side of a slug .",
    "these are the weak downstream fronts . after the drop in @xmath6 , @xmath30 slowly increases in the absence of turbulence and approaches 2.0 ( the value in the parabolic laminar flow ) .",
    "in contrast , for slugs at @xmath36 , the shape of the downstream front in the phase plane is similar to that of an upstream front .",
    "these are strong downstream fronts . here",
    "@xmath6 does not drop directly from the bulk , rather it first shoots upward to a much higher level while @xmath30 slightly increases , followed by a sharp drop to a very low level while @xmath30 hardly changes . then @xmath6 vanishes while @xmath30 slowly approaches to 2 in the laminar flow on downstream of the slug .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the overshoot of @xmath6 across the downstream front becomes increasingly sharp and the shape of the curve @xmath37 becomes very close to that of the upstream front .",
    "( the upstream front is always of strong type . )",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite , who measured the streamwise velocity profile of upstream and downstream fronts for @xmath38 in an @xmath20-@xmath22 pipe cross - section and showed that they were similar .     for comparison , in figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap](b )",
    "we show phase plane trajectories for a model puff , weak slug , and strong slug typical of those from the model of pipe flow proposed in @xcite and discussed in detail in @xcite . while the model captures the qualitative essence of the three states ( a closed loop for a puff , a monotonic decay of @xmath6 for a weak downstream front and increase of @xmath6 before dropping for a strong downstream front ) , it is clear that the model fails to capture quantitatively the structure of fronts from full dns .",
    "the fact that the model value of @xmath6 do not agree with those from dns is not significant , as this could be accounted for with some straightforward rescaling .",
    "what is significant is that the strong overshoots in @xmath6 observed in the dns are missed by the model .",

    "black down - triangles show the mean turbulent advection speed in the bulk region of slugs computed using equation   and discussed in  [ sec : advection ] ]    the preceding description of the fronts is based on long - time and ensemble averaging . however , the intrinsic fluctuations that are smoothed out by averaging are of considerable interest as they can result in strong deviations from the mean behaviour .",
    "our simulations show that in fact substantial changes in the characteristics of the downstream front of slugs can occur during the evolution of a single turbulence structure .",
    "the space - time plots of two turbulent slugs at @xmath39 in figure  [ fig : re3000](a ) illustrate the type of switching between weak and strong downstream fronts that is frequently observed .",
    "such switching behaviour has not been reported previously and was not observed in modelling studies .",
    "the speeds of these two front types have been determined separately and are plotted on the speed diagram of figure  [ fig : re3000](b ) as separate circles .",
    "they lie almost perfectly on the weak and strong speed asymptotics predicted by the theory of @xcite , who considered the limit of infinitesimally thin fronts . in this limit",
    "@xmath6 is a discontinuous function of @xmath30 instead of a steep but continuous function as shown in figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap](a ) .",
    "as the front transiently takes one of the two forms , the ensemble average speed ( the red up - triangle at @xmath39 in figure[fig : re3000](b ) ) sits between the two asymptotic values .",
    "our dns data show that for @xmath40 dynamic switches in downstream front type are often observed . outside of this range",
    "we find almost entirely constant downstream front types , weak fronts at low @xmath0 and strong fronts at high @xmath0 .",
    "the marked differences in propagation speed and turbulent intensity between the two front types calls for a deeper investigation of the physical distinction between them , which we address in the following sections .",
    "@xcite analysed the turbulent kinetic energy of their experimental data , focusing on the radial distribution and the balance of all components of the energy budget .",
    "hot - wire measurements were made of the three velocity components in a @xmath41-plane , with limited spatial resolution ( around @xmath42=0.025@xmath10 , i.e. , 20 points on the radius ) , and hence they had to rely on approximations to obtain all the terms in the budget . from the dns performed in this work we have access to temporally and spatially resolved data , which motivates us to revisit their turbulent kinetic energy budget in order to shed light on the origin of the different turbulent intensity profiles at weak and strong fronts .    here",
    "we use the reynolds decomposition of the velocity field @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total velocity , @xmath45 is the mean velocity field averaged over time and over the homogeneous ( azimuthal ) direction , and @xmath46 is the fluctuation with respect to the mean .",

    "the einstein summation convention is used and @xmath52 is the fluctuating rate of strain .",
    "the production term and dissipation term are @xmath53    we note that @xcite defined the dissipation as @xmath54 which does not fully account for the viscous dissipation in turbulence and mixes viscous dissipation and energy flux ( transport ) due to diffusion . as a result their analysis underestimated dissipation .     kinetic energy budget ( integrated over pipe cross - section ) in the frame of reference",

    "figure [ fig : energy_budget ] shows the cross - sectionally integrated energy budget for turbulent fronts at @xmath4 ( a , b ) and @xmath55 ( c , d ) . in the figure , laminar flow is on the left for the upstream front ( a , c ) , and on the right for the downstream front ( b , d ) . in the formulation of @xcite used here , production and dissipation are the source and sink terms in the energy budget and our calculation shows that they are comparable in magnitude at all axial positions .",
    "this is in contrast to the calculation of @xcite , who reported that dissipation is orders of magnitude smaller than production at the fronts ( see table  1 and 2 in their paper ) .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy is due to their definition of the dissipation term .    at strong fronts ( a , c , d ) , as one looks into the fronts from the laminar side , turbulence production first increases sharply , whereas the increase in dissipation is significantly delayed with respect to the production .",
    "this is due to the fact that it takes time for the dissipation , which acts at small length scales , to take effect after the formation of large eddies at the front @xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that there are large eddies at the strong fronts extracting energy from the adjacent laminar flow ( see figure  [ fig : snaps ] and online supplementary movies ) .",
    "as one moves further towards the bulk , the energy production rate decreases and dissipation outweighs production . as a result the turbulence intensity decreases and the strong front eventually manifests an intensity peak ( see figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap ] and figure  [ fig : re3000 ] ) .",
    "production and dissipation eventually level off in the bulk and come into balance , while the energy flux and convection vanish as the equilibrium ( fully developed ) profile is reached .",
    "all terms in the energy budget for upstream and strong downstream fronts exhibit essentially the same streamwise variation , ( apart from the obvious streamwise reflection symmetry ) .",
    "this in turn is responsible for their very similar shape in the @xmath30-@xmath6 phase plane shown in figure  [ fig : sleeping_cap ] . at weak fronts no significant delay of dissipation with respect to production can be observed . here",
    "energy production and dissipation balance each other over any cross - section ( see figure  [ fig : energy_budget](b ) ) , and there is no significant transport of energy along the streamwise direction .",

    "the dynamics of these two specific vortices is representative of advecting structures at their respective reynolds numbers ( see supplementary online movie ) , and suggests that , in addition to the energy budget , weak and strong front can be distinguished by the speed at which vortices are advected relative to the downstream front speed .    in",
    "wall - bounded shear flows the advection speed of turbulent structures ( vortices and streaks ) depends on their size and distance from the wall @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that only small vortices exhibit a clear radial dependence in their advection speed , whereas relatively large vortices are in fact advected at a rather uniform speed ( also evidenced in @xcite ) .",

    "in such a frame of reference , the structures in the bulk of slugs overall stay still , while the fronts move .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : re3000](b ) , at low @xmath78 , mean turbulent advection speed @xmath77 is larger than the speeds of both upstream front ( cyan up - triangles ) and downstream front ( red up - triangles ) .",
    "hence , in the frame in which the bulk turbulent structures are stationary , both fronts move to the left ( upstream direction ) .",

    "the structure of the upstream front remains qualitatively unchanged over the whole reynolds number range and its dimensionless speed monotonically decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the main feature of this front is a sharp peak in turbulent intensity , which is due to the ability of the upstream front to extract energy from the upstream laminar flow . as a result",
    "turbulent production is at the upstream front much larger than in the bulk .",
    "dissipation within the upstream front is similar in magnitude to production , but the peak dissipation is reached downstream of the peak production .",
    "this effect has been missed in prior studies .",
    "this delay arises because the energy is transferred from the large eddies at the interface down to the smallest scales as the turbulent structures are advected downstream .",
    "the behaviour of the downstream front is more complex and changes drastically as the reynolds number increases . at low reynolds numbers the downstream front of slugs is weak , i.e.  consisting of a gradual relaminarisation toward the parabolic flow profile as seen in puffs .",
    "interestingly , we have found that turbulence is locally in equilibrium at weak fronts : at each streamwise location production and dissipation balance and there is no streamwise transport of kinetic energy by diffusion or convection . as @xmath16 increases , strong downstream fronts , characterised by a peak in turbulent intensity similar to that of upstream fronts , are found to dominate .",
    "weakly and strongly expanding slugs can be clearly seen in previous experimental work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the distinction was first noted by @xcite .",
    "a model analysis in the limit of sharp fronts gives a theoretical foundation for the distinction and suggests that at large reynolds numbers the strong downstream front becomes the symmetric image of the upstream front @xcite .",
    "our turbulent kinetic energy budget analysis confirms this prediction .",
    "our results are in line with the conclusions of the seminal experimental studies of wygnanski and co - workers @xcite , and provide a bridge between their analysis of the physics and the recent theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "note however that a different definition of dissipation was used by wygnanski , which does not fully account for the viscous dissipation in turbulence . as a result",
    "@xcite underestimated dissipation at the fronts , which led them to conclude that there is a large net production at strong fronts .",
    "based on a comparison between the advection speed of turbulence in the bulk of slugs and the speed of fronts , our study reveals the fundamental mechanism of transition between weak and strong fronts . for @xmath84 the downstream front travels slower than the bulk turbulent advection speed and so in the co - moving frame , turbulence relaminarises along the weak front . in contrast , for @xmath79 the downstream front travels faster than the bulk turbulent advection speed and so it can aggressively invade the laminar flow ahead , while extracting energy from it just as the upstream front does . in the intermediate regime around @xmath1 , fluctuations of turbulence production / dissipation , may cause temporal switching between the two types of front ( see figure  [ fig : re3000 ] ) . hence the transition from weak to strong fronts",
    "is of statistical nature , exactly as the transition from transient to sustained turbulence @xcite or the onset of weakly expanding slugs  @xcite .",
    "our study has been restricted to pipe flow , but we believe that the front dynamics and physical mechanisms shown here are generic to wall - bounded turbulent flows .",
    "experiments in square ducts display both types of fronts and hence support this hypothesis @xcite . in flows with",
    "two spatially extended dimensions , such as channel and couette flows , advection is possible in the spanwise and streamwise directions @xcite , resulting in substantially more complex front dynamics and challenging current modelling strategies .",
