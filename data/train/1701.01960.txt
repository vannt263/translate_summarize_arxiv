    "random numbers are used in many types of applications , such as cryptography , numerical simulations , and so on .",
    "however , it is not easy to generate `` truly '' random number sequences . pseudo - random number generators ( prngs ) generate the sequences by iterating some recurrence relation ; therefore , the sequences are theoretically not `` truly '' random .",
    "the binary `` truly '' random sequence is defined as the sequence in which each element has a probability of exactly @xmath0 of being `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' and in which the elements are statistically independent of each other .",
    "it is also difficult to ascertain if the sequence is truly random ; therefore , the randomness of the sequences is evaluated statistically .",

    "however , he could not derive the theoretical distribution of the test statistic , but he did make the problems in the dft test clearer . in 2005 , because of these reports , in nist sp 800 - 22 version 1.7 , the lempel - ziv test was deleted , and the dft test was revised according to the report of kim _",
