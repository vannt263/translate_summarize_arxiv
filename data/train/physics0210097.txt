    "towards the end of his life the great astrophysicist subrahmanyan chandrashekar wrote a very interesting , educational , and entertaining book which was a reader s guide to newton s principia (  newton s principia for the common reader  , clarendon press , oxford , 1995 ) .",
    "chandra characterized the nature of his project in the prologue as ",
    "an undertaking by a practising scientist to read and comprehend the intellectual achievement that the _ principia _ is  .",
    "the resulting book is a wonderful translation of newton s arguments into modern language and mathematical notation accompanied by historical and physical commentary .",
    "there is a section of chandra s book in which he claims to find a small error in the principia .",
    "this is the sort of claim that naturally draws one s attention .",
    "however we believe that there is a mistake of interpretation underlying chandra s claim and that the principia is correct as it stands .",
    "this short paper describes chandra s misinterpretation of a geometric construction of newton and gives an outline of newton s demonstration by following the standard english version of the _ principia _ line by line and converting it into modern mathematical notation in the spirit of chandra s book .",
    "first a brief description of the issue , which concerns newton s prescription for determining the orbits under an inverse cube force ( proposition xli , corollary , iii , page 132 , section 50 in chandrashekar ) which appears about a quarter of the way through the _ principia_. after newton has introduced his laws of motion and derived kepler s laws , he is in the midst of deriving properties of orbits for various types of centripetal forces , employing such ideas as energy conservation and the clear formulation of initial value problems . in corollary",
    "iii to proposition xli concerning the orbits under a centripetal force , newton outlines a geometric construction for determining the orbits under an inverse cube force .",
    "this construction relies on the use of an auxiliary conic section , the curves vrs in the figure shown below . according to newton s construction",
    "when the auxiliary curve is a hyperbola , the constructed orbit ( the curves vpq ) spirals in towards the center and when the auxiliary curve is an ellipse the constructed orbit is a hyperbola .",
    "this introduction of an auxiliary curve has led to some confusion and led chandrashekar to assert , in section 50 of his book , that the correct result is the other way around and that the statement in the _ principia _ must be a misprint .",
    "it seems that the introduction of an auxiliary curve led chandrashekar to a slight misinterpretation of the argument which it is the purpose of this note to clarify .    in this paper",
    "all  quotes  from the _ principia _ , which was of course originally written in latin , are from the english translation  sir isaac newton s mathematical principles of natural philosophy and his system of the world ",
    ", translated by a. motte , revised by f cajori , university of california press , berkeley , 1934 ) . @xcite    golubfig1.ps + fig .",
    "1 ) the curve vrs is tha auxiliary conic section used by newton to construct the orbit vpq . in fig .",
    "( a ) the auxiliary curve is an ellipse leading to an orbit , whose radius is given by ct ( rt is the tangent to vrs ) which grows continuously as the auxiliary point r(x , y ) moves down the ellipse to s. in fig .",
    "( b ) the auxiliary curve vrs is a hyperbola leading to an orbit vpq whose radius ( ct ) decreases as the auxiliary point r(x , y ) moves towards s.  the area vrc proportional to the angle along the orbit , vcp , is indicated .",
    "see text below .",
    "( adapted from chandrashekar )    in his discussion  chandra quotes the following passage from the principia :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  .. therefore if the conic section vrs be a , the body will descend to the centre ( _ along vpq _ ) ; but if it be an , it will ascend continually and go farther and farther _ in infinitum_. and on the contrary .",

    "we repeat chandra s calculation of the orbit and in section 3 we show that following newton s prescription leads to the same orbit .",
