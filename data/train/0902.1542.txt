    "since its discovery by sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , hd  149026b has been one of the most closely scrutinized planets outside the solar system .",
    "it is a close - in gas giant , orbiting a g star with a period of only 2.5  d. observations of transits ( sato et al .",
    "2005 , charbonneau et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "2008b , nutzman et al .  2008 ) , in combination with observations of radial - velocity variations of the parent star ( sato et al .  2005 ) , have shown that the planet has approximately saturn s mass but is considerably denser , despite the intense irradiation from the parent star that should inflate the planet and lower its density .",
    "there is consensus among theorists that the reason for the `` shrunken radius '' is a highly metal - enriched composition , although the total metal mass , its distribution within the planet , and the reason for the enrichment are debated [ sato et al .",

    "( 2006 ) , ikoma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , broeg & wuchterl  ( 2007 ) , burrows et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ] .",
    "the total metal mass , for example , ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 among the possible models . the latter estimate would represent 80% of the total mass of the planet .",
    "the planet s outer atmosphere is also of interest , given the possibly unusual composition and the strong heating from the parent star .",
    "models by fortney et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicated the possibility of a very hot stratosphere as a result of gaseous tio and vo opacity . by using the _ spitzer space telescope _ to observe a planetary occultation , harrington et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found the planet s 8  @xmath0 m brightness temperature to be much larger than the temperature that one would expect based on thermal equilibrium with the incident stellar radiation .",
    "this may be the result of the predicted tio and vo heating , although the details of whether and where these absorbers actually condense in the atmosphere are not yet understood ( fortney et al .",
    "2005 , harrington et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "fundamental to all these discussions are the measurements of the mass and radius of hd  149026b .",
    "these measurements are limited by the uncertainties in the stellar mass and radius .",
    "one way to improve the situation is to observe transits with greater photometric precision than has been possible before .",
    "as shown by seager & mallen - ornelas ( 2003 ) , with a good light curve and kepler s third law , one may determine the stellar mean density .",
    "if the mean density is known precisely enough , it is a key constraint that can be combined with the other stellar observables ( parallax , apparent magnitude , effective temperature , metallicity , etc . ) and stellar - evolutionary models to determine the stellar mass and radius .",
    "this technique has been put into practice for many other systems [ see , e.g. , sozzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , holman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ] but never to advantage for hd  149026b because of the limited precision of prior determinations of @xmath3 ( winn et al .",
    "2008b , nutzman et al .  2008 ) .",
    "observers must cope with the small transit depth of 2.5  mmag ( smaller than any other transiting exoplanet by a factor of two ) and the paucity of suitable comparison stars within the field of view of most telescopes .",
    "in this paper we present observations of transits of hd  149026b with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer [ nicmos , thompson  ( 1992 ) ] on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "we chose this instrument because a high precision in relative photometry is possible even without using comparison stars ( gilliland  2006 , swain et al .",
    "2008 ) and because the reduced stellar limb - darkening at near - infrared wavelengths is advantageous for the light - curve analysis ( carter et al .",
    "2008 , pl et al .",
    "2008 ) . we have organized this paper as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and data reductions leading to the final photometric time series . in ",
    "[ sec : nicanalysis ] we describe our photometric model and the results of the nicmos light - curve analysis . in ",
    "[ sec : stellar ] , we describe how the light - curve results were incorporated into stellar - evolutionary models to determine the parameters of the hd  149026 system . in ",
    "[ sec : joint ] , the light analysis is repeated using not only the nicmos data but also the most precise light curves that have been obtained at optical and mid - infrared wavelengths . in   [ sec : timing ] , all the available transit times are analyzed to produce a refined transit ephemeris and to search for possible period variations that could be indicative of additional bodies in the hd  149026 system ( holman & murray  2005 , agol et al .",
    "2005 , ford & holman 2007 ) . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the possible implications of our observations and analysis .",
    "we observed hd  149026 on four occasions ( `` visits '' in _ hst _ parlance ) when transits were predicted to occur , on 2007  dec  22 , 2007  dec  24 , 2008  feb  08 , and 2008  mar  20 .",
    "each visit consisted of five orbits spanning a transit . between each pair of orbits",
    "is an observing gap of approximately 45 minutes , when _",
    "_ s vision is blocked by the earth .",
    "the visits were scheduled in such a manner that the combined data set provides complete phase coverage of the transit , including redundant coverage of the critical ingress and egress phases .",
    "in particular , visits 1 and 3 covered the ingress phase , and visit 2 covered both ingress and egress phases .",
    "visit 4 captured the beginning of egress .",
    "we used camera 3 of the nicmos detector , a @xmath10 hgcdte array with a field of view of @xmath11 .",
    "we used the g141 grism filter , which is centered at @xmath12 m , spans 0.8  @xmath0 m and is roughly equivalent to @xmath13 band .",
    "an exposure was obtained every 13  s. the camera was operated in `` multiaccum '' mode , wherein five nondestructive readouts are recorded during a single exposure , and the first readout is subtracted from the final readout . after accounting for overheads , the effective integration time was 4  s per exposure .",
    "we deliberately defocused the instrument to give a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 5 pixels in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "this was done for two reasons : firstly , when focused , camera 3 undersamples the point - spread  function ( psf ) of point sources ; and secondly , the detector pixels exhibit intra - pixel sensitivity variations as large as 30% . defocusing the images",
    "causes the psf to be well - sampled and averages over the intra - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "approximately 220 exposures were collected during each _ hst _ orbit .",
    "experience with _ hst _ has shown that photometric stability is relatively poor during the first orbit of a given visit .",
    "our observations were scheduled under the assumption that the first orbit from each visit would not be utilized , and indeed we ended up omitting the first - orbit data from our analysis . at the start of each visit , we obtained a single non - dispersed image using a narrow filter centered at @xmath14  @xmath0 m in order to establish the pixel position corresponding to zero dispersion .",
    "we then adopted the relation from the _ hst _ data handbook for nicmos , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wavelength ( measured in @xmath0 m ) , and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 coordinate ( measured in pixels ) relative to the center of the undispersed image .    for completeness , we performed the steps of flat - fielding , background subtraction , and pixel flagging , as described below ; however , it is noteworthy that these steps in the data reduction made very little difference in the aperture photometry or in the final results .",
    "flat - field correction for grism images is not straightforward and is not done as part of the standard nicmos pipeline reductions , because the appropriate flat field depends both upon wavelength and upon the position of the source in the non - dispersed image . to accomplish the flat - field correction",
    ", we obtained seven flat fields , each using a narrow bandpass within the g141 bandpass , and fitted the data for each pixel with a quadratic function of wavelength @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we then applied @xmath20 $ ] as a multiplicative correction to each of our science images , using the wavelength - coordinate relation @xmath16 that was determined from the single non - dispersed image .",
    "the background level was estimated in each image based on the counts in a relatively clean region of the detector ( away from the spectral trace ) and subtracted from the entire image . to identify bad pixels ,",
    "all images from a given orbit were used to create a time series of counts specific to each pixel .",
    "pixels showing an anomalously large variance were flagged .",
    "the list of flagged pixels was appended to the list of hot or cold pixels that were identified in the standard nicmos pipeline reductions , and the values of all of those bad pixels were replaced by interpolated values of the neighboring good pixels .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the first - order spectrum , using a simple sum of the counts within a rectangular box centered on the spectral trace .",
    "the box had a width of 20 pixels in the cross - dispersion direction ( the @xmath21 direction ) , which was four times the fwhm of the psf .",
    "the box had a length of 120 pixels in the dispersion direction ( the @xmath18 direction ) , which was long enough the capture the entire first - order spectrum .    at this stage",
    "the data had been reduced to a single number per , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 good data points in visits 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "[ fig : raw ] shows the time series of the aperture - summed flux , after dividing by the mean flux . in each panel ,",
    "the zero point of the @xmath18-axis is the expected mid - transit time .",
    "the flux decrement during the transit is identifiable , but this decrement is superimposed on at least two other sources of variability : orbit - to - orbit discontinuities , and smooth intra - orbital variability showing a consistent pattern among all orbits of a given visit .",
    "the intra - orbital variability has been seen by all other investigators attempting precise _ hst _ photometry of single bright stars , since the pioneering work by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the flux discontinuities have been seen by other investigators using nicmos ( see , e.g. , swain et al .",
    "the origins of these systematic effects have not been established .",
    "the orbit - to - orbit consistency of the smooth variations suggests a phenomenon that is a function of the phase of the telescope s orbit around the earth , such as thermal cycling or scattered light .",
    "the discontinuities between orbits suggest a non - repeating event associated with the re - aquisition of the target star after each earth occultation , such as pointing changes or positional shifts of the grism filter .",
    "ideally , the underlying physical processes giving rise to these systematic effects could be ascertained , and this understanding would lead to either the recognition of an improved method for deriving the photometric signal or a physical model that could be used to correct the aperture - summed flux .",
    "given that we do not yet have such knowledge , what can be done ?",
    "the intra - orbital variations are very well - described by a smooth function of the _ hst _ orbital phase ; following other investigators we used a smooth function with several adjustable parameters as an _ ad hoc _ model for this variation .",
    "the parameters of this model are fairly well constrained by the out - of - transit data , for which all variations are assumed to be systematic effects .",
    "the inter - orbital discontinuities are more problematic . to investigate the systematic effects",
    ", we examined the spectral trace on each image .",
    "specifically we computed the flux - weighted mean @xmath21 position as a function of @xmath18 , giving a curve @xmath25 representing the centroid of the spectral trace ( the `` footprint '' of the spectrum on the detector ) .",
    "we also estimated the orientation of the spectral trace relative to the detector edges , by performing a linear fit to the previously calculated function @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : trace ] shows the results . within a single orbit , the position and orientation of the spectral trace",
    "are relatively constant , as compared to the larger movements that are observed between orbits .",
    "the largest variations of the spectral trace ( its position and width ) seem to coincide with the largest discontinuities in the flux time series .    given the correlations that are observed between the properties of the spectral trace and the aperture - summed flux , the approach taken by swain et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and other investigators is to `` decorrelate '' the flux against a number of measured parameters ( `` state variables '' ) such as the mean @xmath21 position , cross - dispersion width , orientation angle , and so forth .",
    "one way to achieve this decorrelation is to fit linear functions of the state variables to the out - of - transit data , for which all time variations are expected to be due to the systematic effects . then the best - fitting parameters are used to correct all of the data .",
    "alternatively , one could fit for the linear functions of the state variables simultaneously with the parameters describing the transit light curve .",
    "we attempted both of these procedures and found that while they do reduce the amplitude of the systematic effects , they still leave highly significant systematic variations .",
    "we also find this procedure to be undesirable because it is not clear which parameters to include in the fit ; because the fitted parameters are highly correlated ( the state variables do not vary independently ) ; and because we have no justification for the assumption of a linear function for any of these parameters , without an understanding of the underlying physical effect .",
    "an example of a possibly relevant physical effect that would not necessarily be described by a linear function is intra - pixel sensitivity variation , which could lead to a function that is periodic in the pixel coordinates of the spectral trace .",
    "we attempted to fit numerous physically - motivated models ( based on the premise of intra - pixel sensitivity variations , among others ) , and did not find any such model that provided a good fit to the data while also having only a few , nondegenerate adjustable parameters .",
    "ultimately we gave up on attempting to correct the intra - orbital discontinuities based on _ a priori _ information .",
    "instead we included in our model an adjustable multiplicative factor specific to each orbit .",
    "this might seem devastating to the goal of analyzing the transit light curve , but this is not so .",
    "it means that we can not make use of the relative flux between orbits to derive the transit depth ; but as we will show , the truly precious information is in the duration of ingress or egress , which is much less vulnerable to the problem of flux discontinuities . in addition , four of the orbits spanned a full ingress or egress .",
    "data from those four orbits does provide useful information about the transit depth , because the discontinuities appear between orbits and not within orbits .    all together ,",
    "our model for the flux variation due to systematic effects is @xmath26 ^ 2 + { c^{v}_{2}}[{\\phi}(t)]^3\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath27 index specifies the visit number ( 14 ) , the @xmath28 index specifies the orbit number ( 14 ) within each visit after omitting the first orbit , the 16 numbers @xmath29 are the multiplicative factors describing the inter - orbital discontinuities , @xmath30 is the _ hst _ orbital phase at time @xmath31 , and the 12 numbers @xmath32 ( 3 per visit ) are constants specifying a polynomial function of @xmath33 that describes the intra - orbital variation .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "orbital phase was defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35  hours is the orbital period of the _ hst _ around the earth and @xmath36 is the midpoint of each orbit s observations .",
    "the choice of a polynomial , as opposed to some other smoothly varying function , was arbitrary .",
    "we also tried using sinusoidal functions with an angular frequency of @xmath37 , with no significant differences in any of the results described below .",
    "for the transit model , we used the analytic formulas of mandel & agol  ( 2002 ) .",
    "our parameters were the planet - to - star radius ratio ( @xmath38 ) , the cosine of the orbital inclination ( @xmath39 ) , the semimajor axis in units of the stellar radius ( @xmath40 ) , the mid - transit time @xmath41 , and the two coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 of a quadratic limb - darkening law , @xmath44 where @xmath0 is the cosine of the angle between the observer and the normal to the stellar surface and @xmath45 is the specific intensity as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we allowed @xmath42 and @xmath43 to vary freely , subject to the conditions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "these conditions require the brightness profile to be everywhere positive and monotonically decreasing from limb to center . in practice ,",
    "the fitting parameters were actually @xmath49 because @xmath50 and @xmath51 are weakly correlated , unlike @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( pl  2008 ) . in computing the transit light curve we assumed the orbit to be circular , consistent with the findings of sato et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and madhusudhan & winn ( 2008 ) .",
    "we held the orbital period fixed at the value @xmath52 days based on the results of winn et al .",
    "( 2008b ) . here",
    "the period is used only to relate the measured transit durations and @xmath40 . the fractional error in @xmath53 is approximately @xmath54 times smaller than the fractional error in @xmath40 and is safely ignored ( carter et al .",
    "2008 ) .    our complete model of",
    "the photometric time series was the product of the transit model and @xmath55 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] ) .",
    "we fitted simultaneously for the parameter set @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the polynomial describing intra - orbital variations was specific to each visit , and the flux discontinuities were specific to each orbit , but the transit parameters were required to be consistent across all orbits and visits .",
    "we performed a least - squares fit to the unbinned data using a box - constrained levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( levenberg  1944 , marquardt  1963 , lourakis  2004 ) utilizing the jacobian calculation of pl  ( 2008 ) .",
    "box constraints were needed to enforce the restrictions on the limb darkening parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the goodness - of - fit statistic was @xmath59 where @xmath60 the calculated flux at the time of the @xmath61 data point during visit @xmath27 , @xmath62 is the @xmath61 flux measurement during visit @xmath27 , @xmath63 is the number of data points in visit @xmath27 , and @xmath64 was assumed to be a constant at this step . the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : raw ] shows the best - fitting model .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) residual between the data and the best - fitting model is 440 parts per million ( ppm ) .",
    "this is approximately @xmath65 times the expected noise level calculated within the nicmos calibration pipeline ( which is dominated by photon noise ) .",
    "[ fig : hist ] shows histograms of the residuals for all the data and for each visit individually .",
    "the residuals are not gaussian ; the flattened peak in the histograms indicates a nonzero kurtosis - like statistic that accounts for the skewness and kurtosis of the residuals ( see , e.g. , amendola et al .",
    "1996 ) . using this different fitting statistic",
    ", we found that the best - fit parameter values were unchanged .",
    "this was not surprising because bias is expected to arise from skewness ( as opposed to kurtosis ) and the skewness of the residuals is very small .",
    "however , the confidence intervals are affected by the kurtosis .",
    "we found that accounting for kurtosis leads to error bars that are _ smaller _ than the error bars quoted here , but only by a modest amount ( @xmath66 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the results quoted in this paper are based on the standard @xmath67 statistic given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) . ] .",
    "evidently the noise is not photon - limited , and is not gaussian , but at least it does not appear to be strongly correlated in time .",
    "we assessed the degree of temporal correlations ( `` red noise '' ) in two ways .",
    "first , we binned the residuals in time by a factor @xmath68 ranging from 1 to 100 , and calculated the standard deviation @xmath69 of the binned residuals .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] .",
    "they follow closely the expectation of independent random numbers , @xmath70^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath71 is the number of bins .",
    "second , we calculated the allan ( 1964 ) variance @xmath72 of the residuals , defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the residual of the @xmath75th data point , @xmath68 is the number of data points , and @xmath76 is the lag . the allan variance is commonly used in the time metrology literature to assess @xmath77 noise . for independent residuals ,",
    "one expects @xmath78 .",
    "the results for our data , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] , satisfy this expectation .",
    "there is no readily identifiable time - correlated component in the time series of residuals .    plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawperperts ] is the measured flux after dividing by the optimized function @xmath55 .",
    "this represents our best effort to correct for the systematic effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , we show the results of combining the data from all the visits ( after correcting for systematic effects ) into a single transit light curve . in this composite light curve ,",
    "the median time between samples is @xmath79  s. finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_binned ] we show a time - binned version of the composite light curve to allow a visual comparison with the best previously - measured light curves , at optical and mid - infrared wavelengths .    to determine the `` allowed range '' of each parameter",
    " or , more precisely , the _ a posteriori _ joint probability distribution of all the parameter values  we employed the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique ( see , e.g. , winn et al .  2007 ; burke et al .  2007 )",
    ". we produced 8 chains of length @xmath80 using a gibbs sampler and a metropolis - hastings jump condition such that each parameter had an effective chain length of roughly @xmath81 .",
    "this was accomplished by adjusting the scale of the jump - function distribution such that the probability of accepting a jump is roughly uniform and equal to approximately @xmath82 across all parameters . to establish initial estimates of parameter uncertainties ,",

    "2008 ) . in this sense ,",
    "the greatest value of the nicmos data is in the good coverage of the ingress and egress phases .",
    "the enhanced precision of the nicmos data relative to previous data sets does not lead to a correspondingly enhanced precision in the planet - to - star radius ratio .",
    "this is because we allowed the time series from each orbit to have its own adjustable flux multiplier .",
    "consequently , all of the information about @xmath38 comes only from those orbits that span an entire ingress or egress event .",

    "since we do not understand all of our noise sources with a physically - grounded model , we can not rule out the possibility that the discrepancy between our result and the previous results is due to a faulty model of the systematic effects .",
    "the culprit would probably need to be the polynomial function of orbital phase .",
    "we do find that our result is unaffected if we replace the polynomial function of @xmath33 with trigonometric functions , as mentioned previously ; and we also find that our results are unchanged if we use a linear limb darkening law or fix the quadratic limb darkening parameters to those tabulated by claret ( 2000 ) .",
    "these tests do not prove that our results are valid but they do suggest that our analysis procedure is robust to changes in the functional form of the model .",
    "however , to the extent that the intra - orbital variations are not strictly repeatable within a given visit , our model would produce biased results .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows the data after dividing by the optimized values of @xmath98 ( the orbit - specific flux multipliers ) and dividing by the optimized transit model .",
    "the purpose of the divisions is to isolate the intra - orbital systematic effects , which do appear consistent among the orbits within a given visit .",
    "another possibility for the discrepancy in the transit depth between our near - infrared result and the previous optical and mid - infrared results is differential absorption due to constituents in the outer , optically - thin portion of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "this interpretation is the basis of the `` transmission spectroscopy '' technique for identifying constituents of exoplanetary atmospheres pioneered by charbonneau et al .",
    "we consider this possibility at some length in sections [ sec : joint ] and [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "<S> . models of the planetary interior still require a metal - enriched composition , although the required degree of metal enrichment is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that the deeper nicmos transit is caused by wavelength - dependent absorption by constituents in the planet s atmosphere , although simple model atmospheres do not predict this effect to be strong enough to account for the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> we use the 4 newly - measured transit times to compute a refined transit ephemeris . </S>"
