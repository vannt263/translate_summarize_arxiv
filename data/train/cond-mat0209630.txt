    "the history of statistical mechanics begins with the gas kinetic theory of elastically interacting particles .",
    "it is well known that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) plays a key role in statistical mechanics@xcite , and the relaxation of nonuniform dilute gases to the equilibrium state is described by the boltzmann equation@xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic equations have also been derived from the boltzmann equation based on the chapman - enskog method@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when there are inelastic interactions among particles , the behavior of collections of particles is completely different from that of elastic particles : there are no equilibrium states and any spatially homogeneous states are no longer achieved .",
    "such a collection of the particles having inelastic interactions is called the granular gas whose physical realization can be observed in rings of planets , small planets , suspended particles in fluidized beds , and rapid granular flows _ etc._@xcite .",
    "a proper set of hydrodynamic equations for granular fluids depend on situations . in some cases , granular particles are condensate and",
    "the fluid obeys bagnolds scaling in which shear stress is proportional to the square of strains .",
    "this flow is called a frictional flow and achieved in many situations under the gravity@xcite .",
    "the derivation of bagnolds scaling is not difficult if we adopt a phenomenology@xcite but is complicated if we wish to derive it from a microscopic motion of particles . on the other hand , there are some flows dominated by binary collisions among particles .",
    "we call this flow a collisional flow or a rapid granular flow and its constitutive equation is similar to that of the navier - stokes equation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shear stress is proportional to the strains@xcite . for rough particles near the boundaries",
    ", we may need to consider the effects of spins of particles@xcite , but for smooth particles we do not need such the complications .    for collisional granular flows",
    ", we may have a standard procedure to derive hydrodynamic equations starting from the inelastic boltzmann equation .",
    "the most of papers assume inelastic hard - core collisions among particles .",
    "in fact , there are some important investigations along this line . jenkins and savage@xcite assume that the velocity distribution function obeys the local maxwellian , and derive a set of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "later , lun _",
    "et al._@xcite , and jenkins and richman@xcite remove the ansatz of the local maxwellian and derive hydrodynamic equations .",
    "recently , sela and goldhirsch@xcite indicate the insufficiency of the grad expansion by jenkins and richman@xcite , and they have developed a systematic expansion of spatial inhomogeneity and small inelasticity . in practical sense , the method developed by brey _",
    "et al._@xcite and garzo and dufty@xcite is the most useful , in which they have extended the chapman - enskog method to gas particles with inelastic hard - core collisions .",
    "their method seems to be reasonable and can be used for any inelasticities .",
    "however , the method adopted there contain some unclear points ; ( i ) all of methods contain two types of perturbations .",
    "one is for spatially inhomogeneity and another is for inelasticities .",
    "although the result by brey _ et al._@xcite is comparable with numerical results with any inelasticities , the logical support of their method for inelastic particles far from the elastic limit is unclear .",
    "in fact , they assume that the vdf in a homogeneous state obeys a function with the lowest order sonine expansion , which should be only valid for nearly elastic cases .",
    "( ii ) their analysis does not contain any information of tails in vdf which is believed to obey an exponential function and can not be described by the expansion by the sonine polynomials .",
    "the effect of tails may be small but it is unclear how it affects hydrodynamics .",
    "the difficulties in the analysis of inelastic hard - core particles come from the form of the collisional integral which is proportional to the relative speed of colliding two particles .",
    "it is known , however , that the collisional integral of the maxwell molecules which has the potential @xmath1 with the relative distance @xmath2 of colliding two particles is independent of the relative speed@xcite .",
    "thus , the maxwell model has been used for the analysis of the boltzmann equation as the simplest model .",
    "quite recently , this model is applied to kinetics of inelastic particles@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that a tail of the scaled velocity distribution function in a homogeneous cooling state of the inelastic maxwell model can be obtained analytically@xcite .",
    "the result of their analysis in which the tail of vdf obeys a power law is also interesting , because this result is consistent with the result of simulation in fluidized beds which has a long - ranged hydrodynamic interactions@xcite , and leads to some singularities in higher order moments .",
    "the objective of this paper is to derive a set of hydrodynamic equations from the inelastic boltzmann equation systematically . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the inelastic maxwell model , and the chapman - enskog method developed by brey _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow . in the next section",
    ", we explain the derivation of hydrodynamics from the inelastic boltzmann equation for the inelastic maxwell model .",
    "the result contains the transport coefficients such as the viscosity , the thermal conductivity , and the diffusion coefficient as a proportional constant to the density gradient in the heat flux . the detailed calculation for the homogeneous solution and the framework of the chapman - enskog solution , and explicit calculation of the transport coefficients",
    "are presented in appendices a , b , and c , respectively . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the linear stability of the homogeneous cooling state .",
    "this requires consideration of the explicit form of vdf at the first order and some transport coefficients in burnett order .",
    "appendices d and e provide the calculations of these quantities . in section iv",
    ", we discuss our result .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the scaling solution in a cooling state is equivalent to a steady state with the gaussian thermostat .",
    "so the generalization of the analysis developed in this paper and others is relevant to discuss a steady systems of particles suspended by fluid flows . in section",
    "v , we will conclude our results .",
    "in this section , we derive the chapman - enskog solution of inelastic boltzmann equation with inelastic maxwell particles . here",
    "we adopt the chapman - enskog method developed by brey _",
    "et al._@xcite which is the most useful in the practical sense .",
    "we also restrict our interest to the case of three dimensional dilute gases .",
    "thus , the argument is parallel to that by brey _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "let us assume low density gases of smooth identical particles with the mass @xmath3 , the velocity @xmath4 and the diameter @xmath5 .",
    "hydrodynamic variables to characterize the macroscopic behavior of the gas are the number density @xmath6 , the velocity field @xmath7 and the temperature field @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the position and velocity distribution function .",

    "the operator @xmath17 is the inverse of the collisional operator @xmath18 which are defined as @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the coefficient of restitution which is ranged @xmath20 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath0 is a constant for the simplification of our argument , though the actual coefficient of restitution depends on the impact velocity@xcite .",
    "the effects of the impact velocity dependence of @xmath0 to macroscopic hydrodynamics can be seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the operators @xmath18 and @xmath17 satisfy @xmath21 for an arbitrary function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is @xmath18 or @xmath17 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we indicate that our model is almost the same as that for inelastic hard - core particles .",
    "the difference appears through the simplification of the collisional integral : the term @xmath25 for hard - core model with the heviside function @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 with a constant @xmath28 . as mentioned in introduction this simplification",
    "is justified for the potential obeying @xmath1 with the relative distance of colliding particles for @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that many of inelastic maxwell models contain the factor @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 in eq.([b2])@xcite .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath30 leads to inconsistent results with the elastic maxwell model in the limit of @xmath32 , _",
    "e.g. _ the viscosity becomes proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "our choice ensures the consistent result with the elastic maxwell model .",
    "namely , the viscosity is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "our model may be interpreted as follows .",
    "particles feel the long - range repulsive interaction by the potential obeying @xmath1 , and the energy of colliding particles loses by eq.([b3 ] ) at the instance of changing the direction of the relative velocity .",
    "it is easily verified that the loss of kinetic energy in each collision is @xmath35 a useful identity for an arbitrary function for an arbitrary function @xmath22 is @xmath36 = \\chi \\sigma^2\\displaystyle\\sqrt{\\frac{t_0}{m}}\\int d{\\bf v}_1 \\int d{\\bf v } f f_1 \\int d\\vec{\\hat \\sigma}({\\bf g}\\cdot\\vec{\\hat\\sigma } ) ( b-1)h({\\bf v}),\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . from this identity",

    "it is , however , impossible to get the complete solution of the boltzmann equation which is a nonlinear and a differential integral equation .",
    "thus , we need a systematic perturbative scheme to obtain the solution",
    ".    one of the systematic methods to obtain an approximate solution is the chapman - enskog method@xcite .",
    "this method is regarded as a standard one in the gas kinetic theory of elastically interacting particles .",
    "the method assumes a solution of the boltzmann equation to the form @xmath52.\\ ] ] this means that space and time dependences appear through hydrodynamic variables @xmath53 .",

    "thus , we assume that the distribution function is represented by a series @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a formal expansion parameter and set to be unity after the calculation .",
    "the expansion parameter is assumed to be balanced with the spatial gradients .",
