    "both standard @xcite and inflationary cosmology @xcite suffer from the initial singularity problem and hence can not yield complete descriptions of the very early universe .",
    "if one were able to construct a non - singular bouncing cosmology , this problem would obviously disappear .",
    "however , in order to have a chance to obtain such a non - singular cosmology , one must either go beyond einstein gravity as a theory of space - time ( see e.g. @xcite for an early construction ) , or else one must make use of matter which violates the  null energy condition \" ( see @xcite for a review of both types of approaches ) .",
    "interest in non - singular bouncing cosmologies has increased with the realization that they can lead to alternatives to inflationary cosmology as a theory for the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "a specific scenario which can arise at the level of homogeneous and isotropic cosmology is the  matter bounce \" paradigm which is based on the realization @xcite that vacuum fluctuations which exit the hubble radius during a matter - dominated contracting phase evolve into a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations on super - hubble scales before the bounce .",
    "the key point is that the curvature fluctuation variable @xmath0 grows on super - hubble scales in a contracting phase , whereas it is constant on these large scales in an expanding phase . since long wavelength modes exit the hubble radius earlier than short wavelength ones",
    ", they grow for a longer period of time .",
    "this provides a mechanism for reddening the initial vacuum spectrum .",
    "it turns out that a matter dominated contracting phase provides the specific boost in the power of long wavelength modes which is required in order to transform a vacuum spectrum into a scale - invariant one .",
    "studies in the case of various non - singular bounce models @xcite have shown that on wavelengths long compared to the duration of the bounce phase , the spectrum of fluctuations is virtually unchanged during the bounce .",
    "thus , a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations survives on super - hubble scales at late times .",
    "provided that the bounce can occur at energy scales much below the planck scale , non - singular cosmologies solve a key conceptual problem from which inflationary cosmology suffers , namely the ",
    "trans - planckian \" problem for fluctuations @xcite : if the period of inflationary expansion of space lasts for more than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble expansion rate during inflation ( in order to solve the key cosmological mysteries it was designed to explain , inflation has to last at least @xmath3 ) , then the physical wavelengths of even the largest - scale fluctuation modes we see today will be even smaller than the planck length at the beginning of inflation and thus in the  zone of ignorance \" where the physics on which inflation and the theory of cosmological perturbations are based , namely einstein gravity coupled to semiclassical field theory matter , will break down .",
    "in contrast , in a non - singular bouncing cosmology the wavelength of modes which are currently probed by cosmological observations is never much smaller than @xmath4 ( the physical wavelength of the mode which corresponds to our current hubble radius evaluated when the temperature of the universe was @xmath5 ) and hence many orders of magnitude larger than the planck length .",
    "thus , the fluctuations never enter the  trans - planckian zone of ignorance \" of sub - planck - length wavelengths .",
    "possibly the simplest realization of the matter bounce scenario is the ",
    "quintom bounce \" model @xcite and is obtained by considering the matter sector to contain two scalar fields , one of them ( the  ghost field \" ) having the  wrong \" sign of the kinetic action .",
    "the potential of the ghost scalar field also has the opposite sign to that of regular scalar fields such that in the absence of interactions , the ghost field has a classically stable minimum .",
    "as has been noticed in @xcite , such a quintom bounce model also arises from the scalar field sector of the  lee - wick \" ( lw ) lagrangian @xcite which contains higher derivatives terms .",
    "the quintom and lee - wick bouncing cosmologies are obtained in the following way @xcite : we begin in the contracting phase with both the regular and the ghost scalar field oscillating homogeneously in space about their respective vacua .",
    "we assume that the energy density is dominated by the regular matter field , and that hence the total energy density is positive .",
    "once the amplitude of the regular scalar field exceeds the planck scale , the field oscillations will freeze out and a slow - climb phase will begin during which the energy density of the field only grows slowly ( this is the time reverse of the slow - roll phase in scalar field - driven inflation )",
    ". however , the ghost field continues to oscillate and its energy density ( which is negative ) continues to grow in absolute value .",
    "hence , the total energy density drops to zero , at which point the bounce occurs , as has been studied both analytically and numerically in the above - mentioned works . note that the energy density in this bounce model scales as matter until the regular scalar field freezes out .    a major problem of bouncing cosmologies realized with matter which scales as @xmath6 as a function of the scale factor @xmath7 is the potential instability of the homogeneous and isotropic background against the effects of radiation ( which scales as @xmath8 and anisotropic stress which scales as @xmath9 .",
    "if we simply add a non - interacting radiation component to the two scalar field system , then unless the initial energy density in radiation is tuned to be extremely small , then the radiation component will become dominant long before the bounce can arise , and will prevent the energy density in the ghost field from ever being able to become important , resulting in a big crunch singularity . similarly , unless the initial energy density in anisotropic stress is very small , it will come to dominate the energy density of the universe long before the bounce is expected . the anisotropies will destabilize the homogeneous background cosmology , and will prevent a bounce .",
    "note that at the quantum level , there is an additional severe problem for bounce models obtained with matter fields with ghost - like kinetic terms , namely the quantum instability of the vacuum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the radiation instability problem . for the purpose of this discussion we will simply assume that anisotropic stress is absent . in a recent paper ,",
    "two of us studied the possibility that a bounce could arise if radiation is supplemented with lee - wick radiation @xcite .",
    "however , we showed that this hope is not realized : the addition of lee - wick radiation does not prevent the big crunch singularity from occurring . in the presence of radiation ,",
    "the only hope to obtain a bounce is to introduce a coupling between radiation and ghost scalar field matter which could effectively drain energy density from the radiation field and prevent the energy density of radiation from becoming dominant .",
    "here we study this possibility .",
    "however , at least for the specific lagrangian which we consider , we find that a bounce only emerges for highly fine - tuned phases of the fields and their velocities in the initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the model we study , namely the scalar field sector of lee - wick theory coupled to radiation , and write down the general equations of motion . in section iii we set up the equations of motion linearized about the bounce background , treating the entire radiation field as an inhomogeneous fluctuation . in particular , we study the different terms which contribute to the energy - momentum tensor and identify those which could assist in obtaining a non - singular bounce . in section",
    "iv we study the solutions of the perturbed equations of motion , and in section v we analyze the evolution of the different terms in the energy - momentum tensor , identifying the conditions which would be required in order to obtain a non - singular bounce .",
    "we have also evolved the general equations of motion for the two inhomogeneous scalar field configurations and the classical inhomogeneous radiation field in the homogeneous background cosmology .",
    "section vi summarizes some of the numerical results .",
    "both the analytical and numerical results confirm that we need unnatural fine - tuning of the initial conditions in order to obtain a non - singular bounce . in the final section",
    "we offer some conclusions and discussion .",
    "the lee - wick scalar field model coupled to electromagnetic radiation is given by the following lagrangian : [ leewick ] l&=&-_^+(^2 ) ^2-m^2 ^ 2-v ( ) + & & - f _",
    "f^-f(,^2,f_f^ )  , where @xmath10 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is its potential . here we adopt the convention that ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) , where @xmath7 is the scale factor of the universe . since it is a higher derivative lagrangian in @xmath11 , the scalar field sector contains an extra degree of freedom with the ",
    "wrong \" sign kinetic term and with a mass set by the scale @xmath13 .",
    "we choose @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the planck mass , since we want the regular scalar field to dominate at low energies , but at the same time we do not want to worry about quantum gravity effects .",
    "the second line of the lagrangian ( [ leewick ] ) contains the kinetic term of the radiation as well as the coupling term , where we assumed both for the sake of generality and because of foresight that the radiation field couples not only to the scalar field @xmath11 itself , but also to the higher derivative term .",
    "the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath16 , is related to the radiation field @xmath17 through the usual definition f _ _ a_-_a _ , where @xmath18 is the covariant derivative .",
    "it is convenient to extract the extra degree of freedom as a separate scalar field . to do this",
    ", we use the field redefinitions & & _ 1-_2 , + _ 2 & & ^2 /m^2 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ leewick ] ) then takes on a simpler form : [ leewick2 ] l & = & -__1^_1+__2^_2-m^2 ^2+m^2 ^2 + & & - f _",
    "f^-f(_1,_2,f_f^ )  , where we have chosen the potential to be zero . in this new form , the lagrangian describes two massive scalar fields with one of them ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) behaving like aghost \" , and both of them coupled to the radiation field .    the coupling term @xmath20 should in principle be arbitrary , however , in this paper we will take a specific form for convenience .",
    "the form will be : [ f1 ] f(_1,_2,f_f^ ) = ( c^2+d^2)f _ f^  , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coupling constants which have mass dimension @xmath23 . the interaction terms are non - renormalizable . to make sure that such terms could be thought of as arising from an effective field theory which is consistent at the bounce",
    ", we must make sure that the coefficients are chosen such that the contribution of the interaction term to the lagrangian density is smaller than that of the other terms .",
    "this must be true even at energy densities at which the bounce occurs in the pure scalar field model .",
    "it is easy to see that this condition will be satisfied if the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are both of the order @xmath24 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the effects which these coupling terms have on the dynamics of the system .",
    "we know that in the absence of coupling , i.e. when @xmath25 , a bounce will only occur if the initial radiation energy density is tuned to a very small value compared to the scalar field energy density .",
    "this is because the positive definite energy density of radiation will scale as @xmath8 which is faster than that of the scalar fields , in particular the ghost scalar field .",
    "generically , it will dominate the energy of the universe after some amount of contraction , it will prevent the ghost scalar field energy density from catching up and will thus prevent a bounce , leading to a big crunch singularity instead . with non - vanishing values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , however , the scalars are in principle able to drain energy from the radiation .    from the lagrangian ( [ leewick2 ] ) , one can obtain the stress - energy tensor @xmath26 by varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath27 . in the hydrodynamical limit",
    ", we can take @xmath26 to be of the form of @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "for now , we consider the general form which is :    [ tmunu ] t_&=&g_l+__1__1-__2__2+(1-c_1 ^ 2-d_2 ^ 2)f_f_^  , + & = & g _   + & & + _ _",
    "1__1-__2__2+(1-c_1 ^ 2-d_2 ^ 2)f_f_^  .",
    "since we will be studying the contribution of plane wave perturbations of the scalar fields and we will treat radiation as a superposition of waves , we kept the space - derivative terms .    by varying the lagrangian with respect to the matter fields",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 , we also get the equations of motion for all three fields : [ phi1eom]&&_1-(m^2-f^2)_1=0  , + [ phi2eom]&&_2-(m^2+f^2)_2=0  , + [ amueom]&&(1-c_1 ^ 2-d_2 ^ 2)(_f^+3hf^0 ) + & & -2(c_1__1+d_2__2)f^=0   which will be analyzed in detail in the rest of the paper .",
    "since the equations of motion are nonlinear , we can not work in fourier space , and use plane wave solutions .",
    "however , we are interested in how initially small amounts of radiation build up and possibly transfer their energy to scalar field fluctuations .",
    "we treat radiation as a superposition of fluctuations .",
    "therefore it makes sense to linearize our equations about the homogeneous scalar field background .",
    "thus , we make the following ansatz for the scalar fields : [ ansatzphi ] _ 1(t , z)&=&_1^(0)(t)+_1^(1)(t , z)+^2 _",
    "1^(2)(t ) + _ 2(t , z)&=&_2^(0)(t)+_2^(1)(t , z)+^2 _ 2^(2)(t )  , where the expansion parameter @xmath32 is taken to be much smaller than @xmath33 . should be viewed as parameterizing the initial ratio of radiation energy to background scalar field energy .",
    "thus , the leading contribution of the radiation field is first order in @xmath32 . via the coupling terms in the lagrangian with coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the linear radiation field induces linear scalar field inhomogeneities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these corrections will contain a further suppression factor since @xmath21 and @xmath22 are small coefficients .",
    "similarly , the same coupling terms in the lagrangian will lead to a perturbation @xmath36 of the rescaled radiation field @xmath37 which is of linear order in @xmath32 but suppressed by factors of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . ]",
    "the first term on the right hand side of each line , i.e. @xmath38 correspond to the background fields , the terms @xmath39 are the fluctuations , and the second order terms @xmath40 describe the back - reaction of the fluctuations on the background and can be computed from the leading second order corrections ( averaged over space ) of the equations of motion .    to simplify the analysis , we describe radiation in terms of plane waves in a fixed direction ( which we take to be the @xmath41 direction ) . without loss of generality we can restrict attention to one polarization mode which we take to be the electric field in the @xmath42 direction and the magnetic field in the @xmath43 direction . in this case , the only non - zero components of the field strength tensor are @xmath44 and @xmath45 . using the temporal gauge where @xmath46 , we find that only the first component of the gauge field is non - zero . for a single wavelength fluctuation we can make the ansatz [ ansatzgauge1 ] a_1(k , t )",
    "= f(t)cos(kz ) ( k , t )  , or , equivalently , [ ansatzgauge2 ] a^1(k , t ) = a(t)^-2 ( k , t )  .",
    "since in the linearized equations of motion the fourier modes are independent , we can consider @xmath34 and @xmath35 also to be plane waves propagating in @xmath41 direction , so they depend only on @xmath41 and @xmath47 .    with eqs .",
    "( [ ansatzphi]-[ansatzgauge2 ] ) in hand , we can write down the energy densities of the various fields at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "first of all , we insert the above perturbative ansatz for the fields into the stress - energy tensor of the system . from the general expression ( [ tmunu ] ) for @xmath26",
    "we get :    [ tmunu2 ] t_&=&g _   + & & + _ _",

    ", we can also see that in order to analyze the behavior of the energy density up to second order , we need to know the evolution of scalar fields up to second order as well as that of the gauge field up to first order , while the behavior of the gauge field to second order is not required .",

    "if we only consider the energy density up to second order , these second order field perturbations give a contribution through their coupling to the background fields . in the following",
    "we find the solutions of ( [ eqn2 ] ) and study the effects of the induced terms in the stress - energy tensor on a possible bounce .",

    "this equation can be solved using the born approximation ( details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "the general solution is the sum of the general solution of the homogeneous solution plus the solution including the source which has vanishing initial data .",
    "the inhomogeneous term is suppressed by the coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 compared to the homogeneous solution , but , as shown in the appendix , it scales as a high power of @xmath99 . via the coupling to the background scalar fields , the above second order terms enter into the expression for the energy density to second order .",
    "the signs of the corresponding terms in the energy density are indefinite in the sense that they depend on the phases of the initial field configurations .",
    "since it is these terms that dominate the energy density near the bounce , we find that whether a bounce occurs or not depends sensitively on the phases in the initial conditions , and that in fact in the case of many plane wave modes initially excited , a bounce requires very special phase correlations .",
    "in the previous section we have solved all of the field equations up to second order in the amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "we have found the scaling in time of each field at each order .",
    "now we are ready to look at how all of the terms in the expression for the energy density @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 at various orders in perturbation theory ( namely , eqs . ( [ rho0])-([rho2 ] ) )",
    "scale in time .",
    "this analysis is straightforward but very important if we are to determine whether a bounce is possible , since in four space - time dimensional classical einstein gravity with flat spatial sections a bounce can only happen when the negative terms in the energy density catch up to the positive contributions @xcite .    in the following",
    "we give a table of how each term contained in @xmath29 scales with time as the background cosmology bounce point ( the bounce which is achieved in the absence of radiation and scalar field inhomogeneities ) is approached .",
    "we will identify the terms which dominate in this limit .",
    "this will give us a good indication under which conditions a bounce can occur .",
    "the tables are structured as follows : the first line `` terms '' , indicates which term we are considering , the next set of lines `` behavior '' gives the scaling in time in the various limits and in the two relevant ranges of the parameter @xmath30 which indicates the equation of state , and the last line gives the sign with which the term contributes to the energy density . note that we focus on the growing mode solution to each field ( which is constant for small @xmath62 in the case @xmath103 ) .",
    "we give separate tables for terms of zero - th , first and second order in @xmath32 .",

    "note that we have expressed the time dependence in terms of the dependence on the scale factor @xmath7 . at this stage",
    ", we only need to focus on the exponent of the power - law scaling .",
    "the more negative the power is , the more rapidly the term grows in a contracting phase ( since @xmath7 is decreasing with time ) .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the conditions for a bounce to occur in four space - time dimensional classical einstein gravity with flat spatial sections is that the total energy density reaches zero during the contracting phase .",
    "thus , there needs to be a negative definite term which starts out small but grows faster than the positive definite terms due to the regular scalar field and regular radiation . in the absence of radiation and scalar field inhomogeneities , it is the contribution to the energy density of the ghost field @xmath108 which plays this role .    from the table",
    "we see that there are three kinds of terms : positive definite , negative definite and indefinite ones .",
    "the first set contains the kinetic and potential terms of the normal scalar as well as the free energy density of the gauge field , the second set is made up of the kinetic and potential terms of the ghost scalar , while the third set contains terms which arise due to the coupling terms between scalars or between scalars and gauge fields .    looking first at the terms which are independent of the coupling term between the fields , we see from the first line of the `` behavior '' set of lines in the third table that , indeed , in the presence of radiation the energy density in radiation grows faster than that in the two scalar fields , thus preventing a bounce . in the presence of coupling between the fields , however , there are terms which scale with a larger negative power of @xmath7 .",
    "the signs of some of them , however , depend on the initial phases for the linear fields @xmath37 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "note that the signs of the scalar coupling terms are determined by the evolution of each field and thus are hard to be identified in a general analysis .",
    "the same is true for the gauge coupling terms ( the last two in the third table ) .",
    "however , the coupling terms between the scalar fields and the gauge field ( the third to last in the third table ) can be made negative / positive definite easily by setting the signs of the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be both positive / negative .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the contracting phase begins with the regular scalar field dominating the energy density , and that the contribution of the lee - wick scalar is much smaller . for single fourier mode initial conditions of the radiation field ,",
    "this can be achieved with the appropriate choice of the initial phase ( see example 1 in the following section containing our numerical results ) . however , for multiple initial radiation fourier modes excited any initial phase difference between the modes will produce a contribution with the wrong sign and will thus prevent a bounce ( see example 3 in the following section ) . in the presence of an infinite set of modes , the phase correlations required to obtain a bounce thus appear to have negligible measure in initial condition space .",
    "thus , even in the presence of coupling between scalar fields and radiation , the lee - wick bounce is unstable .",
    "the bounce , if it exists , will happen at a time which can be chosen to be @xmath109 .",
    "its duration ( the time interval lasting from the time the hubble radius stops decreasing in the contracting phase until when it starts expanding in the post - bounce phase ) will be denoted by @xmath110 . since the various components of the energy density scale with different powers of @xmath7 , it is clear that the duration of the bounce will be shorter or equal to the hubble radius @xmath111 ( which gives the time scale on which the ratios of energy densities in different components change ) at the beginning of the bounce phase .",
    "for the background bounce model , we have @xmath112 .",
    "there are two kinds of bounces according to the duration of the bounce phase i ) if the period @xmath113 , the bounce will go from the time t_b^- ~- ~- to the time t_b^+ ~ ~ with a low speed .",
    "we call this a `` slow bounce '' . in this case",
    ", the universe will enter the bounce period at the critical time @xmath114 , and only the @xmath115 approximate solutions of the previous tables will be applicable and not ones for the interval @xmath116 .",
    "ii ) if the period @xmath117 , the bounce will happen in a very short time with very fast speed .",
    "this can be called the `` fast bounce '' . in this case",
    ", the universe evolves from the far past ( @xmath118 with @xmath119 ) to @xmath109 , passing through the point @xmath120 , then entering into the region @xmath121 before finally reaching the bounce point . in this case , both of the two approximate solutions of the field evolution will be applied .",
    "let us now consider the necessary conditions for a bounce ( as we have indicated above and will see from the numerical analysis , these conditions are not sufficient - in addition to the conditions which follow , appropriate correlations in the initial phases are required ) .",
    "we start in the region of time @xmath115 .",
    "we study the conditions required to have the terms that might give a bounce grow relative to the other terms during this phase .",
    "if the conditions are not satisfied , or the bounce does not happen even if the conditions are satisfied , then a bounce may still occure in the @xmath116 region .",
    "the conditions for the terms in the energy which could compensate the positive radiation contribution to become dominant are then studied .",
    "if these conditions are not satisfied , either , then a bounce is impossible .",
    "a necessary condition for a bounce to be possible requires the growth rate of one of the indefinite sign terms in the third table above exceed all that of all of the positive definite terms . in the @xmath115 region , this requires @xmath122 , which equivalently constrains the equation of state parameter @xmath59 to be in the range @xmath123 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied in this region , then a slow bounce may happen depending on the choice of the initial phases .",
    "if the condition is not satisfied in the @xmath115 region , the universe may evolve into the @xmath116 region , in which the evolution of the fields are different , and new constraints on @xmath30 and @xmath59 will arise if a bounce is to be possible . following the above logic , we find that the conditions under which a bounce might happen are much looser , namely @xmath124 . to summarize this section : we have identified necessary conditions for a bounce to occur . whether one actually does occur even if the conditions are satisfied depends on the initial phases of the fields . this must be studied numerically . in the following section we will give one example of specially chosen phases for which a bounce is possible . however , when we look at a more general choice of phases , the bounce will not occur .",
    "in order to support the analysis in the last section , we performed numerical calculations .",
    "such numerical work is necessary because our analytical analysis is only approximate .",
    "in particular , we worked in perturbation theory up to order second order in @xmath32 .",

    "we choose the initial energy density of the gauge fields to be larger than that of the lee - wick scalar , but less than that of the normal scalar .",
