    "this problem is not simple , and even the calculation of the surface tension coefficient has many difficulties.@xcite at low temperature the quantum nature of the surface excitations becomes important . at very low temperature only few types of surface excitations with the energy less or of the order of temperature",
    "are relevant for the problem .",
    "this fact greatly simplifies the description of liquid surface in the low - temperature limit .",
    "an accurate calculation of the absolute value of the surface tension coefficient @xmath0 remains a challenge , but the calculation of its temperature dependence @xmath1 is much simpler . among all liquids ,",
    "the low - temperature limit is reached only in helium , and the surface of liquid helium has been studied experimentally in great detail.@xcite therefore , we apply our analysis mainly to the liquid helium .",

    ", one may calculate the deviation @xmath6 @xmath7 as the sum of the contributions from all types of surface excitations to the surface free energy per unit square . at low temperature",
    "the concentration of these excitations is low , and the interaction between the excitations can be neglected .",
    "then the surface excitations form an ideal two - dimensional gas of particles with the dispersion determined by the nature of these excitations .",
    "the free energy of this gas is well known@xcite [ see eq . ( [ omsigma ] ) below ] .    at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the only considered type of surface excitations are the quanta of surface waves , called ripplons .",
    "the ripplons lead to the temperature dependence of the surface tension of a liquid given by the atkins formula @xcite:@xmath8where the coefficient @xmath9 mdyn/@xmath10k@xmath11 for @xmath2he .",

    "the damping of the high - energy short - wavelength ripplons must lead to the strong modification of the dependence ( [ atkins ] ) above the @xmath12-point . on contrary",
    ", experiment@xcite gives only very weak change in the temperature dependence of the surface tension at the @xmath12-point , suggesting that the ripplon contribution is not the main one . in liquid",
    "@xmath3he the viscosity is much higher than in @xmath2he , and only the very long - wavelength ripplons with energy @xmath14 survive at @xmath15 .",
    "these long - wavelength ripplons give negligible contribution to the free energy because of the small number of quantum states , which is proportional to the phase volume .",
    "hence , the theory predicts a very weak dependence @xmath1 for @xmath3he in the whole temperature interval , which strongly contradicts the experimental observations@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between the theory and experiment on the liquid helium surface tension remained a puzzle for several decades , until the new type of surface excitations has been proposed.@xcite this new type of excitations , called the surface level atoms ( sla ) or _ surfons _ , allowed to explain the temperature dependence of the surface tension and to reach the very high agreement between theory and experiment.@xcite the surfons resemble the states of @xmath3he atoms on the surface of liquid @xmath2he in the @xmath3he-@xmath2he mixtures @xcite and the states of @xmath3he or @xmath2he atoms on the surface of liquid hydrogen.@xcite the surface states in the @xmath3he-@xmath2he mixtures , called the andreev states , were also introduced to explain the temperature dependence of the surface tension of these mixtures .",
    "the main difference between the andreev states and the surfons is that the latter exist even in the pure he isotopes .",
    "a thorough microscopic description of this new type of excitations is a rather complicated many - particle problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite the surfons were considered phenomenologically as the quantum states of helium atoms localized at the liquid helium surface .",
    "the surfons may propagate in the surface plane and have the quadratic dispersion@xmath16where @xmath17 is the 2d momentum of surfons along the surface .",
    "both the surfon energy @xmath18 and their effective mass @xmath19 depend on the he isotope @xmath3he or @xmath2he .",
    "the surfon energies @xmath18 are intermediate between the energy of a he atom in vacuum @xmath20  and the chemical potential @xmath21 of this atom inside the liquid .",

    "the role of surfons may be crucial for various properties of electrons on the liquid helium surface ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews of this area ) .",
    "electron scattering on surfons reduces the mobility of the electrons.@xcite this scattering also affects the electron transitions between the bound states on the surface , leading to the shift and the broadening of the transition line.@xcite this is particularly important for the physical realization of quantum bits and quantum computing with the use of electrons on the liquid helium surface.@xcite    in the present paper we microscopically substantiate the existence of surfons and study their properties .",
    "we estimate the energy ( [ slaenergy ] ) ant the effective mass ( [ m ] ) of surfons from the microscopic considerations . we show that taking into account the temperature dependence of the chemical potential of liquid helium allows to reach the agreement between theory and experiment on the dependence @xmath32 up to the accuracy of the existing experiments .",
    "we propose the theoretical curve of this dependence in the entire temperature interval from zero to the boiling temperature @xmath33 of liquid helium .",
    "this theoretical prediction explains the existing puzzles in the temperature dependence of the surface tension of liquid helium and other liquids , and stimulates further experiments .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove the existence of the surfons from the quantum - mechanical calculation and to give a rough estimate of its activation energy and effective mass . in the next section",
    "we find these values phenomenologically with higher accuracy from the comparison with experiment on the temperature dependence of the surface tension @xmath34 . in this section",
    "we use the simplified interaction between he atoms , which includes only the hartree term of the van der waals forces and neglects the exchange interaction .",
    "then we solve the one - particle schrdinger equation for the surface atom in the potential , formed by other atoms , taking into account possible formation of a dimple ( or polaron ) under the atom on the surface .",
    "the interaction potential between two helium atoms can be described by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential@xcite @xmath35 ,   \\label{lj}\\]]where the generally accepted coefficients @xmath36are the same for both he isotopes and obtained by fitting the he atom scattering experiments .",
    "this potential includes the van - der - waals attraction between atoms at long distance and the hard - core repulsion at short distance .",

    "the potential energy of an atom above the liquid can be calculated by the summation of the interatomic potential over all atoms in the liquid .",

    "first , the above model takes the liquid surface to be rigid and flat , while in fact this surface is very soft and subjected to deformation , which reduces the bound state energy ( [ slaenergy0 ] ) .",
    "second , the distribution of he atoms in the liquid is not uniform and is affected by an atom on the surface level .",
    "one expects the increase of liquid density around the surfons.third , the identity of the atom on the surface level with the atoms in the bulk liquid leads to the exchange energy correction and other many - body effects.@xcite    the similar problem appears in the calculation of the energy of andreev levels,@xcite i.e. of the bound states of @xmath3he atoms on the surface of liquid @xmath2he .",
    "the solution of 1d schr \" odinger equation with the potential ( [ vz ] ) gives the energy of bound state @xmath49 while the value of andreev energy levels , as obtained from the surface tension experiments , is about @xmath50 .",
    "various approaches have been developed to calculate the andreev energy levels more accurately,@xcite but the substantial disagreement between theoretical and experimental results still exists .      in this section",
    "we study the back influence of the surfons on the bulk liquid . in the first approximation",
    ", one must consider the formation of a dimple under the surfon , similar to the dimple under an electronshikin , edelman , monarkha or negative ion@xcite on the liquid helium surface . in the next approximation one also needs to account for the increase of liquid density in the vicinity of surfon .",
    "this adjustment of the liquid to the appearance of the surfon is similar to the polarons around electrons in solids.@xcite the surface deformation is a polaron of ripplons , while the increase of the liquid density under the surfon is a polaron of bulk phonons .",
    "this composite polaron propagates with  the surfon along the liquid surface , reducing the surfon activation energy and increasing its effective mass .",
    "since the relative variation of the liquid density around the surfon is small , the correction to the surfon activation energy from the density polaron is also small . on contrary , the surface deformation around the surfon may considerably change the van der waals potential at the surface , and this effect must be taken into account .    for the estimate of the correction to the surfon energy and its effective mass due to the dimple on the liquid surface ,",
    "we apply the methods similar to those in the theory of electrons@xcite and negative ions@xcite on the liquid helium surface , replacing the electrostatic attraction by the van - der waals forces .",
    "the formation of a dimple on the surface under the surfon gains the van - der waals energy @xmath51 but costs the surface tension energy @xmath52 and the quantum kinetic energy @xmath53 of the surfon due to the additional confinement of its wave function near the dimple .",
    "all these contributions depend on the shape of the dimple and determine this shape .",
    "their self - consistent calculation requires the solution of the axially - symmetric 3d schr \" odinger equation for he atom above the dimple .",
    "we do not perform the complicated calculation of the dimple profile , because the model of a classical static surface deformation itself is rather rough . instead , we estimate the energy gain due to the formation of the dimple taking its shape @xmath54 to be a spherical cap of radius @xmath55 and depth @xmath56 : @xmath57the loss in the surface tension energy @xmath52 of the shallow dimple of depth @xmath58 is approximately proportional to @xmath59 and depends weakly on the shape of the dimple .",
    "thus , for the spherical dimple ( [ xi1 ] ) @xmath60while for the much smoother gaussian shape @xmath61 with the same depth and curvature in the center , the surface energy loss reduces by one half : @xmath62 .",
    "the van der waals attraction is a very short - range one .",
    "therefore , the optimal dimple does not extend far from the surfon .",
    "the optimal dimple radius is determined from the competition between the van der waals attraction @xmath51 and the kinetic energy @xmath53 .",
    "this competition also happens in the bulk liquid , and leads to the mean inter - particle distance @xmath63 for @xmath2he and @xmath64 for @xmath3he .",
    "below , we take the dimple curvature radius @xmath65 in our estimate of the sla energy correction . the depth of the dimple is determined from the competition between the surface tension energy @xmath66 and the van der waals energy @xmath51 .    the van der waals energy gain from the dimple ( [ xi1 ] ) can be estimated by the integration of the lj potential ( [ lj ] ) over the region @xmath67 @xmath68the kinetic energy @xmath69 already implicitly enters eq .",
    "( [ ew ] ) through the surfon wave function @xmath70 and the minimal dimple radius @xmath71 .",
    "its additional contribution reduces the energy gain ( [ ew ] ) by the factor @xmath72 .",
    "however , we neglect this correction because we did not account for the similar factor in the surface tension energy loss .",
    "we also reduce the van der waals energy gain by similar factor by taking the wave function in the integral ( [ ew ] ) in the form of @xmath73-function : @xmath74 ,  where @xmath75 is the position of the center of surfon .",

    "minimization of @xmath85gives for @xmath2he the optimal dimple depth and energy gain@xmath86and for @xmath3he@xmath87the surfon effective mass increases due to the dimple .",
    "this increase can be roughly estimated assuming that during the surfon motion on the interatomic distance @xmath71 at least all adjacent atoms must also move by the distance of the order of the dimple depth .",
    "then , the surfon effective mass @xmath88the number of adjacent atoms @xmath89 , and we get @xmath90    the above rough calculation is aimed to show that the surface deformation under the surfon is essential both for the surfon activation energy .  for more accurate study of the surfon parameters , in the next section we compare with experiment the thermodynamical properties of liquid surface , calculated using the above model of surfons .",

    "this exchange energy correction is expected to be small and less important for the value of the surface energy level than the local adjustment of the atoms in the liquid to the surfon .",
    "the small value of the exchange energy comes from the very small overlap of the wave functions of he atoms due to their hard - core repulsion ."

    "<S> we investigate the new type of excitations on the surface of liquid helium . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations , called surfons , appear because helium atoms have discrete energy level at the liquid surface , being attracted to the surface by the van der waals force and repulsed at a hard - core interatomic distance . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of the surfons increases with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the surfons propagate along the surface and form a two - dimensional gas . basing on the simple model of the surfon microscopic structure </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the surfon activation energy and effective mass for both helium isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the contribution of the surfons to the temperature dependence of the surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution explains the great and long - standing discrepancy between theory and experiment on this temperature dependence in both helium isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved agreement between our theory and experiment is extremely high . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with experiment allows to extract the surfon activation energy and effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the values of these surfon microscopic parameters are in a reasonable agreement with the calculated from the proposed simple model of surfon structure . </S>"
