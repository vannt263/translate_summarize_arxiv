    "the study of exo - planets ( eps ) requires many different approaches across the full wavelength spectrum to both discover and characterize the newly discovered objects in order that we might fully understand the prevalence , formation , and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "the mid  ir and far  ir spectral regions are especially important in the study of planetary atmospheres as it spans both the peak of thermal emission from the majority of eps thus far discovered ( up to @xmath21000 k ) and is particularly rich in molecular features that can uniquely identify the chemical composition , from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres and trace the fingerprints of primitive biological activity . in the coming decades many space- and ground - based facilities",
    "are planned that are designed to search for eps on all scales from massive , young  hot jupiters \" , through large rocky super - earths down to the detection of exo - earths .",
    "few of the planned facilities , however , will have the ability to characterize the planetary atmospheres which they discover through the application of mid - ir and far - ir spectroscopy .",
    "spica will be realized within @xmath210 years and has a suite of instruments that can be applied to the detection and characterization of eps over the @xmath25210@xmath3 m spectral range ( see e.g.  our _ white paper _ ; goicoechea et al .",
    ".    the safari instrument @xcite will provide capabilities to complement spica studies in the mid - ir ( either coronagraphic or transit studies ) .",
    "indeed , safari could be the only planned instrument able to study eps in a completely new wavelength domain ( for safari s band 1 ) not covered by _ jwst _ nor by _ herschel _ ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this situation is often associated with unexpected discoveries . since cool",
    "eps show much higher contrast in the far - ir than in the near/mid  ir ( e.g.  jupiter s effective temperature is @xmath2110  k ) , if such eps are found in the next 10 years , their transit studies with spica will help to constrain their main properties , which are much more difficult to infer at shorter wavelengths . note that following _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) observations , jupiter seen at 5  pc will produce a flux of @xmath235  @xmath3jy at 37  @xmath3 m , but less than @xmath21  @xmath3jy at 15  @xmath3 m .",
    "safari band1 ( @xmath234  60  @xmath3 m ) hosts a variety of interesting atmospheric molecular features ( e.g.  h@xmath0o at 39  @xmath3 m , hd at 37  @xmath3 m and nh@xmath1 at 40 and 42  @xmath3 m ) . strong emission / absorption of these features",
    "was first detected by iso in the atmospheres of jupiter , saturn , titan , uranus and neptune @xcite ."
