    "dust is a ubiquitous feature of the cosmos . it is present in a wide variety of astrophysical systems , including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and starburst galaxies ( see wang et al .",
    "amorphous silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials ( e.g. , graphite , amorphous carbon , and hydrogenated amorphous carbon ) are thought to be the two dominant cosmic dust species .",

    "in addition to silicate dust , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules also display rich emission bands in the mid infrared ( ir ; tielens 2008 ) .",
    "these features are usually very weak or absent in agns because pahs are believed to have been destroyed by the harsh radiation field of agns ( e.g. , see roche et al .  1991 , voit 1991 , siebenmorgen et al .",
    "2004 ; but also see alonso - herrero 2014 ) .",
    "the 3.4@xmath1 c  h stretching absorption feature is also detected in agns which indicates the presence of aliphatic , chain - like hydrocarbon dust in agns ( e.g. , see imanishi et al .",
    "1997 , mason et al .",
    "compared to agns , starburst galaxies commonly display a low , _ red _ @xmath058@xmath2 emission continuum , strong pah emission features and silicate _ absorption _ features ( brandl 2006 , hao 2007 , smith 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , starbursts lack the 3.4@xmath1 absorption feature .",
    "this may be related to the fact that starbursts , particularly in their nuclear regions , are often heavily obscured by dust and ice . in the milky way ,",
    "the 3.4@xmath1 absorption feature is seen in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , but not in dense clouds where the 3.1@xmath1 h@xmath6o ice absorption feature is strong ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) .",
    "starbursts often exhibit strong h@xmath6o ice absorption at 3.1 and 6.0@xmath1 ( e.g. , see spoon et al .",
    "2004 ) , while these ice features are not seen in agns where it is too hot for ice to survive against sublimation ( see li 2007 ) .",

    "most of the circum - nuclear agn dust emission is generated in the near - ir , presumably in a geometrically and optically thick torus that surrounds the central engine .",
    "the torus exists between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath20 is the dust sublimation radius at which dust sublimates or evaporates ( which is typically a fraction of a parsec and set by the illuminating luminosity ) , and @xmath21 is the outer radius which is not well constrained . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the torus either gradually fizzles , or possibly connects to regions that are dynamically related to the host galaxy .",
    "this outer radius is still the matter of investigation , both in the light of theoretical differences between the smooth - density torus models ( e.g. , see pier & krolik 1992 , granato & danese 1994 , efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 , schartmann 2005 , fritz 2006 ) , and the clumpy torus models ( e.g. , see nenkova 2002 , 2012a+b , hnig 2006 , schartmann 2008 , stalevski 2012 , siebenmorgen 2015 ) , but also because with alma it may be at last possible to determine @xmath21 directly ( see nenkova 2008b , and preliminary alma observations by garca - burillo 2014 ) .",
    "very - high angular resolution interferometry of nearby agn suggests that the near- and mid - ir emission is spatially compact ( e.g. jaffe 2004 , poncelet 2006 , tristram 2007 , raban 2009 , burtscher 2013 ) , albeit this is only derived from simple geometric models of the 2d brightness distribution in the sky .",
    "the so - modeled mid - ir sizes , a few parsecs , suggest small tori indeed , which from the theory / modeling side favors clumpy dust distributions . acknowledging that the specific choice of preferred model is a question beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", we decided on clumpy  seds for modeling the near- and mid - ir spectra of our three galaxies .",
    "clumpy , first introduced by nenkova ( 2002 ) , and fully developed in nenkova ( 2002a , b ) , can compute the radiative transfer solution for an assumed axially - symmetric distribution of dusty clouds , each opaque with optical thickness @xmath22 , and illuminated by a central uv source .",
    "while probably all other models of clumpy tori are monte - carlo ( mc ) in nature , clumpy  is a model with analytically computed statistical properties .",
    "it is therefore fast .",
    "the downside is that it computes the mean solution of all clumpy representations of a system at once , and can by design not generate a single clumpy view .",
    "the single - shot views in mc - based codes , on the other hand , can of course be on occasion very far from typical .",
    "it is important to note that the gas and dust distributions in real systems are probably more complex than those in most simple 1d and 2d models .",
    "more recent 3d mc models allow for additional complexity , for instance by introducing a two - phase medium : a clumpy component , plus a smooth intra - cloud matter distribution ( e.g. stalevski 2012 , siebenmorgen 2015 ) .",
    "others have undertaken great efforts to compute in radiative - hydrodynamical simulations the distribution and flow of the interstellar molecular gas around a supermassive black hole , down to the very centers of agns ( e.g. wada & norman 2002 , wada 2009 , schartmann 2010 , hopkins 2012 ) .",
    "the formalism underlying the clumpy  model was in detail described in nenkova ( 2002 , 2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "we content ourselves with giving here the gist . in this model",
    "the agns torus is populated by dusty clouds , with matter - free space between them .",
    "radiation can propagate unimpeded between the individually optically thick clouds .",
    "the visibility of the nucleus along the line - of - sight ( los ) to an external observer is probabilistic , and , in stark contrast with smooth - density torus models , is governed not only by the torus angular width and the viewing angle , but also by the random clumpiness of the cloud distribution .",
    "an observer has a finite chance of seeing the unobscured nucleus even at edge - on views , if the photons generated in the central engine manage to avoid absorption by intervening torus clouds .",
    "because clouds located at different position angles around the agn show different phases of their hot and cool faces , an external observer always registers emission from a mix of different dust temperatures , originating from co - located regions around the agn .",
    "that these different dust temperatures co - exist at the same distance from the central engine is a hallmark characteristic of clumpiness",
    ". it has been confirmed observationally in ngc1068 , using the _ mid - infrared interferometric instrument _ ( midi ) on the eso s _ very large telescope interferometer _ ( vlti ) , where two co - located dust components at distinctly different temperatures of @xmath0800k and @xmath23300k have been found ( jaffe 2004 , raban 2009 , khler & li 2010 ) .",
    "notably , the hot component is missing in the resolved vlti observations of the circinus galaxy ( tristram 2007 , 2014 ) .",
    "more recently , in a much more complete sample of agns observed with vlti / midi , burtscher ( 2013 ) have modeled the observed radial brightness profiles with a resolved gaussian plus an unresolved point - source .",
    "they find that the fractional contribution of the unresolved component exceeds @xmath050% for 15 out of 23 detected agns .",
    "even with the extremely high spatial resolution afforded by vlti / midi , only two of the 20 + observable agns are close enough and luminous enough for their very central torus regions to be resolved .",
    "burtscher ( 2013 ) suspect that this may be the reason why so far only ngc1068 has revealed a very hot dust component .",
    "the simplest possible general makeup of an axially symmetric clumpy cloud distribution arguably requires no less than six free parameters .",
    "the radial torus size @xmath24 is a multiple of the scale - invariant dust sublimation radius @xmath20 , which is set only by the agn luminosity , with @xmath25 a free parameter .",
    "the mean number of clouds per radial ray in the equatorial plane clouds is @xmath26 . for radial rays",
    "@xmath27  degrees away from the equator the number of clouds along the line of sight(los ) falls off as a gaussian with width @xmath28  deg ( measured from the equatorial plane ) .",
    "our viewing angle @xmath29 onto the system is measured from the torus axis .",
    "the local cloud number density falls off radially as @xmath30 , with the power - law index @xmath31 . finally , the only property of a single cloud ( in this minimal model ) is its optical depth @xmath22 in the visual band .",
    "we consider a mixture of amorphous silicate ( ossenkopf et al .",
    "1992 ) and graphite ( draine & lee 1984 ) , with a mass mixing ratio of 0.53:0.47 .",
    "the dust grain size is assumed to follow a mrn - type power - law distribution for each dust species @xmath32 , where the power - index @xmath33 is fixed at 3.5 , and the lower and upper cut - off sizes are taken to be @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively ( mathis et al .  1977 ) .",
    "in this section we fit the starlight , pah- and gas - line - subtracted seds of the three galaxies , derived in  [ sec : data ] , by using the clumpy  model presented in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we then find the best - fit model parameters and their marginalized posteriors using the bayesian markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sed fitting code developed by nikutta ( 2012 ) .",
    "it performs a multi - dimensional interpolation of the model seds at the requested parameter values and wavelengths , and allows estimation of model parameters including their significance . as priors , we assume uniform probability density distributions for all parameters , in light of their unknown true properties.$ ] to ensure random distribution of orientations in the sphere of the sky .",
    "] the error bars for f10398 + 1455 and f21013 - 0739 are increased by a factor of 3 and 5 respectively , to aid the fitting algorithm which we think suffers otherwise under overly optimistic uncertainties on the data quality .",

    "one possible reason for the mismatches may lie in the specific interstellar dust properties that we used : the clumpy  model assumes a mass mixture of 53% silicate dust and 47% graphite dust , with the optical constants of silicate and graphite respectively sourced from ossenkopf ( 1992 ) and draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that among those agns exhibiting the silicate emission features , a vast majority have their `` 10@xmath1 '' feature peaking at a longer wavelength compared to that of the diffuse ism ( see hao 2005 , siebenmorgen 2005 , sturm 2005 , li 2008 , mason 2009 , smith 2010 , shi 2014 ) .",

    "_ features all peak at @xmath09.7@xmath1 and are comparable to that of the interstellar silicate .",
    "therefore , it is unavoidable for the clumpy  model which is based on the ossenkopf ( 1992 ) silicate opacity to predict too long a peak wavelength for the silicate emission feature .",
    "moreover , the @xmath018@xmath1 continuum opacity of the ossenkopf ( 1992 ) silicate is higher than that of the draine & lee ( 1984 ) `` astronomical silicate '' by a factor up to 2 .",
    "this explains the flat @xmath058@xmath1 continuum emission of the clumpy  model : with the 9.7 and 18@xmath1 silicate emission features remaining to be fitted , the ossenkopf ( 1992 ) silicate opacity would naturally result in a higher level of the @xmath058@xmath1 continuum emission than the draine & lee ( 1984 ) `` astronomical silicate '' ( but also see sirocky et al .",
    "also , the mismatch to the steep @xmath058@xmath1 continuum of f10398 + 1455 and f21013 - 0739 may be caused by the fixed mass ratio of silicate - to - graphite of @xmath62 . a higher @xmath63 ratio may lead to a steep @xmath058@xmath1 continuum . in paper",
    "i , we have qualitatively discussed the possible dust properties that may account for the steep @xmath058@xmath1 continuum while exhibiting the prominent silicate emission feature in terms of dust composition , size and temperature .",
    "based on the dust opacity characteristics presented in figure  4 of paper i , we proposed that sub-@xmath64m - sized , iron - poor silicate as well as the deficit of carbon dust could probably be responsible for the anomalous seds observed in these three galaxies . in xie ( 2015 , hereafter paper ii ) such dust properties have been explored in terms of a simple optically - thin model consisting of a mixture of warm and cold silicate dust , and warm and cold carbon dust .",
    "it was found that models consisting of `` astronomical '' silicate , amorphous olivine , or pyroxene , combined with amorphous carbon or graphite , are all capable of successfully fitting the observed ir emission .",
    "the dust temperature is the primary cause in regulating the steep @xmath058@xmath1 continuum and silicate emission , insensitive to the exact silicate or carbon dust mineralogy .",
    "more specifically , the temperature of the @xmath058@xmath1 continuum emitter ( which is essentially carbon dust ) of these galaxies is @xmath0250400@xmath65 , much lower than that of typical quasars which is @xmath0640@xmath65 .",

    ", one needs to incorporate these different dust compositions and mass ratios into the clumpy  radiation transfer model . in nikutta ( 2016 , in preparation ) , we will investigate these dust characteristics with the clumpy  model .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath058@xmath1 continuum observed in the three galaxies might be affected by an optically thick dust disk ( distinct from the clumpy component ) , which displays steeper @xmath058@xmath1 continuum emission in comparison with the clumpy models ( see siebenmorgen 2015 , figure 5c ) .    to further explore",

    "it is apparent that @xmath61 shows little correlation with @xmath25 , @xmath31 , @xmath22 and @xmath29 , while it appears that @xmath61 is related to @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "the weak correlation between @xmath61 and @xmath28 or @xmath26 is due to the fact that a _ larger _",
    "@xmath28 or @xmath26 results in _ more _ obscuration in the inner torus and therefore overall _ colder _ dust emission .",
    "we have modeled the _ spitzer_/irs spectra of three spectroscopically anomalous galaxies ( iras  f10398 + 1455 , iras  f21013 - 0739 and sdss  j0808 + 3948 ) by decomposing them via pahfit , subtracting the starlight , pah and atom - line components , and then modeling the residual dust component with the clumpy  torus model .",
    "the ir spectral characteristics of these galaxies are unique in the sense that they show silicate emission which is characteristic of agns , while they also show a steep @xmath058@xmath2 continuum and strong pah emission features typical for starburst galaxies .",
    "in contrast , agns exhibit a _ flat",
    "_ emission continuum at @xmath058@xmath1 and lack the pah emission features .",
    "the 9.7 and 18@xmath1 silicate features seen in emission in these three galaxies are seen in absorption in starbursts .",
    "we have investigated whether their anomalous seds could be explained by adjusting the dust cloud distribution and the viewing angle toward the agns torus .",
    "we find that the clumpy  model is generally successful in explaining the overall dust ir emission , although it appears to emit too flat a @xmath058@xmath1 continuum to be consistent with that observed in iras  f10398 + 1455 and iras  f21013 - 0739 . also , the peak wavelength of the model silicate emission feature is too long compared with that observed in all three sources .",
    "we argue that the problem of the model - predicted longward - shifted silicate emission peak could be solved by incorporating different silicate species other than the ossenkopf ( 1992 ) silicate opacity , and the problem of the model - predicted flat @xmath058@xmath1 continuum could be solved by incorporating iron - poor silicate dust and/or a higher silicate - to - graphite mass ratio than that currently adopted in the clumpy  model .",
    "other than modifying the dust minerology , the presence of an optically thick dusty disk might also produce a steep slope of @xmath058@xmath1 continuum as seen in the three galaxies .",

    "<S> the steep @xmath058@xmath1 continuum and strong pah emission features suggest the presence of starbursts , while the silicate emission is indicative of significant heating from agns . </S>",

    "<S> we employ the pahfit software to estimate their starlight contributions , and the clumpy  model for the components contributed by the agn tori . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the clumpy  model is generally successful in explaining the overall dust infrared emission , although it appears to emit too flat at the continuum to be consistent with that observed in iras  f10398 + 1455 and iras  f21013 - 0739 . </S>",
