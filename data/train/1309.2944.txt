    "comet 10p / tempel 2 is the second largest jupiter - family comet in existence ",
    "only 28p / neujmin 1 is known to be larger  and is comparable in size to 1p / halley .",
    "unlike halley , however , tempel 2 has a very small fraction of its surface that is still active ( @xmath11% ) and is therefore one of the most highly evolved comets .",
    "these two properties have made it possible to study its nucleus at both larger heliocentric distances @xcite and at favorable perihelion passages @xcite .",
    "it also exhibits a strong asymmetry about perihelion in brightness @xcite and production rates due to the seasonal effects associated with the orientation of the rotation axis and a small source region near one pole that dominates the outgassing @xcite .",
    "of particular interest here is that tempel 2 is one of the first comets to exhibit not just a change in its rotational period @xcite but a progressive spin - down over multiple apparitions .",
    "our lightcurve measurements obtained at the 1999 apparition gave a period of 8.941@xmath00.002 hr , about 32 s longer than the value of 8.932@xmath00.001 hr two orbits earlier in 1988 based on a reanalysis of all available data @xcite .",
    "we followed this with further measurements in 2010 , finding a period of 8.950@xmath00.002 hr , thereby strongly implying the spin - down is caused by progressive torquing associated with the outgassing from the near - polar source region @xcite .",
    "the situation , however , is somewhat more complicated than it first appears .",
    "while the measured spin - down was the same between 1988 and 1999 , and between 1999 and 2010 , the observations in the earlier apparitions were obtained several months prior to perihelion while the observations in 2010 were obtained between two and six months following perihelion .",
    "thus a somewhat larger change in period was expected in the second pairing if the amount of torque remained the same at every perihelion passage . while our 2010 result might be explained by a secular decrease in outgassing that we observed during the past quarter century , it remained unclear what period tempel 2 ultimately attained as it retreated from the sun in 2011 and activity dropped off .",
    "additionally , all of the reported values for its rotation period are synodic rather than sidereal . while some evidence has suggested that tempel 2 is in prograde rotation @xcite , a reanalysis of the same data gave conflicting results @xcite . since the spin - down of the nucleus adds a further complication to extracting the sense of rotation from varying synodic effects , we considered the direction of rotation as being unresolved , resulting in a pair of possible sidereal periods for each synodic result .",
    "for example , the 2010 synodic value of 8.950@xmath00.002 hr corresponds to a prograde sidereal solution of 8.948@xmath00.002 hr or a retrograde solution of 8.955@xmath00.002 hr , where these offsets are asymmetric due to the earth s orbital motion . since the difference between synodic and sidereal varies with orbital position and observer geometries , this results in an added ambiguity to the specific amount of torque delivered each apparition .",
    "fortunately , the sense of rotation can be resolved with additional measurements of tempel 2 at a more distant location in its orbit when the synodic / sidereal difference is much smaller than near perihelion .    with these motivations , and with access to our new 4-meter class discovery channel telescope ( dct )",
    ", we decided to again measure tempel 2 s rotation period but this time near aphelion .",
    "the specific timing of the observations was based not only on the observing geometries but also required waiting for the comet to move sufficiently far away from the galactic plane .",
    "the initial night of planned observation also proved to be the first successful night of science operations for dct , still early in its commissioning phase .",
    "we present here lightcurve data obtained over a 3-month interval , and the resulting derived period along with the implications of this result .",
    "lowell observatory s discovery channel telescope saw first light in april 2012 , less than 7 years after ground - breaking .",
    "the telescope , with a 4.3-m primary , is located near happy jack , az , at an elevation of 2337 meters ( cf .",
    "site testing yielded a median seeing of 0.84 arcsec @xcite and delivered images already routinely exhibit fwhm of @xmath20.8 arcsec when atmospheric conditions are good .",
    "the first instrument designed for dct is the large monolithic imager ( lmi ) , which began service in september 2012 . containing a newly developed 6.1k@xmath36.1k ccd by e2v",
    ", this camera yields a 12.3 arcmin on a side field - of - view at the f/6.1 ritchey - chretien focus @xcite .",
    "our observations were obtained using 2@xmath32 on - chip binning , resulting in a pixel scale of 0.240 arcsec , and we used a kron - cousins r band filter throughout .",
    "successful and useful observations were acquired on two nights in january 2013 , one in march , and two in april ; planned observations in february were snowed out while limited observations in may were interrupted by technical problems ( including a regional power failure ) making the remaining data useless for this project .",
    "observational circumstances for each of the five useful nights are given in table  [ table1 ] , including heliocentric distance ( @xmath4 ) , geocentric distance ( @xmath5 ) , and phase angle ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the january and march runs each immediately followed large storms , resulting in quite poor and variable seeing ( @xmath21.02.4 arcsec ) , while conditions were better in april ( @xmath20.91.3 arcsec ) ; image quality additionally degraded at high airmasses as we attempted to maximize the temporal coverage each night . as expected during the very early science phase of a new telescope undergoing commissioning , a variety of small issues emerged and some affected the observations .",
    "in particular , pointing map problems in january required us to use the sidereal rate and manually guide on stars rather than track at tempel 2 s rate of motion . four - minute integrations were used , resulting in 1.6 arcsec of trailing of the comet .",
    "we were able to use our preferred mode of tracking at the comet s rate of motion on the other runs , resulting in trailed comparison stars , though no tracking was actually required nor performed in april because the comet was within days of its stationary point . with a shorter exposure of 150 s and the slower rate of motion of the comet",
    "as it approached its stationary point , stellar trailing was quite small , 0.6 arcsec , in march while the comet trailed by @xmath10.1 arcsec in april .",
    "the choice of the aperture size for photometric extractions was , as usual , a compromise between a variety of factors , including trailing and seeing as just described , along with the contrast of the object to the sky , and how crowded the field was .",
    "the faintness of the comet and the occasional close passage of field stars argued for a small aperture while the other factors pushed for larger sizes , especially in january .",
    "fortunately , as discussed below , no coma was detected and so no removal was necessary .",
    "we ultimately chose to minimize the resulting scatter in tempel 2 s lightcurve each night , which resulted in aperture radii of 11 pixels ( 2.6 arcsec ) in january , 8 pixels ( 1.9 arcsec ) in march , and 6 pixels ( 1.4 arcsec ) in april ; sky measurements were obtained from the median value in an annulus between 30 and 60 pixels ( 7.214.4 arcsec ) .",
    "the effects of changing seeing were directly compensated for by using identical apertures for on - frame comparison stars ( see below ) , while the differential effects associated with trailing were minimized with these relatively large extraction apertures .",
    "calibration was performed using standard techniques with the interactive data language software package for removing bias and applying median twilight flat fields .",
    "an extinction coefficient of 0.098 mag per unit airmass was determined on jan 13 , and was applied to all of each nights data as a first - order correction for airmass .",
    "a minimum of seven comparison stars were used each night ; the relatively slow motion of the comet at aphelion coupled with the large field of view of lmi meant these stars remained in the field throughout the night .",
    "remaining variations from frame to frame due to cirrus , changing seeing , and second - order airmass effects were compensated for by determining and applying the median value of the deviations of all the comparison stars . in practice , though the resulting standard deviations for the comparison stars were quite small , the scatter for the much fainter comet became unacceptable when this correction was larger than 0.5 mag , and we therefore excluded data above this threshold .",
    "we additionally excluded frames for which the comet was adversely affected by nearby stars , cosmic rays , etc .",
    "the uncertainties on each resulting measurement of tempel 2 were based on the photometric uncertainties combined with the standard deviations of the comparison star corrections .",
    "absolute flux calibrations were applied by using sdss r filter catalog values of each of our comparison stars .",
    "the average nightly uncertainty in the absolute flux calibrations was 0.06 mag , which encompasses both the uncertainty in the catalog magnitudes themselves and color effects in the extinction correction . the resulting nightly instrumental correction varied by as much as 0.3 mag because several nights had no interval when the sky was photometric .",
    "while landolt fields were observed on the few photometric occasions , these measurements were too sparse to significantly improve the absolute calibration but did confirm that our calibration was good to better than 0.1 mag . assuming a solar color",
    ", we applied an average offset of 0.22 mag to convert from sdss r to cousins r. final lightcurve measurements and uncertainties of all 422 useful data points ( as defined above ) are listed in table  [ table2 ] , as well as the observed mid - times for each image .",
    "the reduced lightcurves are displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] as a function of time for each of the five nights .",
    "immediately evident is the large decrease in brightness during the apparition that will be shown later to be simply due to the combination of increasing distance and increasing phase angle .",
    "gaps in the data on jan 12 and the apparent late start on jan 13 are due to clouds and/or the comet passing too close to a star .",
    "series of images having the best effective seeing from jan 13 and again from apr 6 were stacked to search for evidence of a coma ; none was detectable on either night .",
    "comparison of the wings of the comet s radial profile to stellar radial profiles on apr 4 and apr 6 ( when the non - sidereal motion was negligible ) suggests than any non - stellar component had an upper limit of 5% of the total cometary flux .",
    "therefore no coma removal was required ( or possible ) from these observations , unlike observations near perihelion .    to remove the observed secular trend , we next performed a standard asteroidal normalization for these nuclear magnitudes to absolute values by correcting for heliocentric and geocentric distances and to zero phase angle , i.e.   from the reduced magnitude , @xmath7 , to @xmath7(1,1,0 ) .",
    "our first attempts at normalization used the same linear phase function that we applied in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "this failed , however , to yield consistent brightnesses among the three observing runs no matter what phase coefficient was used .",
    "in retrospect , this was not surprising due to the much smaller phase angles involved in 2013 and the typical asteroidal non - linear opposition effect . rather than empirically determining the needed curvature",
    ", we decided to use a model phase curve that best matched c - type asteroids , those with physical characteristics such as albedo most similar to comet nuclei .",
    "fitting and interpolating the values from table iv of @xcite , we computed phase adjustments ( @xmath5@xmath8 ) for each night as given in table  [ table1 ] . the resulting @xmath7(1,1,0 )",
    "values at lightcurve maxima were in remarkable agreement , indicating that the phase function for tempel 2 s nucleus is indeed well - represented by c - type asteroids , and no further adjustments were applied .",
    "we continue to use our interactive period search routine for period determinations .",
    "as described in more detail in @xcite , phase plots are instantaneously updated as we systematically step through possible periods and examine by eye the tightness of resulting lightcurves .",
    "data are color - coded by date , making it easy to see small offsets in either brightness or phase throughout the phased curve .",
    "this is particularly useful when the intrinsic scatter due to photometric uncertainties is larger than usual , as we have here ; a slightly incorrect period will only have a very slight increase in scatter and most period search algorithms will not `` see '' that one day is offset from another .",
    "in fact , we also used the phase dispersion minimization method @xcite and , while this gave the same result , its uncertainty is much greater than what can be easily estimated from the color - coded phase plots , i.e.   when clear shifts between observing runs is evident .",
    "note that standard routines can also misinterpret changes in the shape of the lightcurve , another factor here .",
    "our overall best observed period solution was 8.948@xmath00.001 hr , and the corresponding phase plot is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig2 ] . since there is no obvious preferred zero point for phasing , we choose 2013 jan 0.0 as this placed zero phase away from interesting features and the @xmath5@xmath9 values correspond to the day of the year ; prior to phasing , the @xmath5@xmath9 values were first corrected for light travel time from the observed mid - times in table  [ table1 ] . as with previous apparitions",
    ", we have a double - peaked light curve where the two maxima are nearly identical in brightness but the minima are quite different , with the deeper minimum nearly `` v''-shaped while the smaller minimum varied in depth and shape with changing viewing geometry .",
    "unfortunately , our phase coverage is incomplete in april and the shallower minimum is not sampled , so we can not determine if the change in depth from january to march continued . also evident is a @xmath20.02 mag shift of much ( but not all ) of the jan 12 lightcurve from that of a day later on january 13 , for which we have been unable to identify a cause .",
    "while this has no effect on the the period solution , it alters the perception of the shape for the first half of the lightcurve .",
    "we also phased subsets of the data to look for evidence of a change in the observed period associated with the changing viewing geometries . as expected , phasing jan / apr yielded the same result as the entire data set , while a minor change was evident for the other two pairings  jan / mar gave a slightly smaller value ( 8.947@xmath00.001 hr ) and mar / apr gave a slightly larger value ( 8.949@xmath00.002 hr ) with the higher uncertainty in the latter value directly caused by the shorter interval . within the uncertainties",
    ", this increase matches the predicted change of @xmath100.001 hr , caused simply by the earth s orbital motion between our earliest midpoint pairing and the latest ; the solar component to the synodic period near aphelion is both small and unchanging .",
    "these calculations all use the pole orientation from @xcite of r.a .",
    "= 162@xmath11 and dec .",
    "= @xmath1058@xmath11 ( and the diametrically opposite solution for retrograde rotation ) , but similar pole positions , such as from @xcite , would yield the same results .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , one goal of these observations was to uniquely discriminate between prograde and retrograde rotation for tempel 2 s nucleus .",
    "the sense of rotation always determines the sign of the solar component of the synodic period while the earth s component is unaffected by the direction of rotation . at the midpoint of our ensemble of measurements for 2013 , the solar and earth components are coincidentally nearly identical and in the prograde case have opposite signs that cancel out , resulting in the sidereal period being the same as the synodic ( 8.948@xmath00.001 hr ) , while in the retrograde case they compound yielding a sidereal value of 8.950@xmath00.001 hr .    to determine which solution is correct",
    ", we next re - examine the solutions from 2010 .",
    "our overall observed ( synodic ) value was 8.950@xmath00.002 hr with a corresponding midpoint time of 2010 oct 25 or 112 days following perihelion @xcite . based on our water production rates throughout the apparition , over 95% of the total outgassing",
    "had taken place by this date . with an observed change in period of about @xmath100.004 hr per perihelion passage",
    ", we concluded that further torquing late in the 2010 apparition should be negligible and that the sidereal period in 2013 would therefore be unchanged from the late 2010 result .",
    "the corresponding sidereal values at the 2010 midpoint are 8.948 hr ( prograde ) and 8.955 hr ( retrograde ) .",
    "note that these values are slightly different from those listed in @xcite which erroneously only included the solar component but not the earth s component . with the expectation that the sidereal value should be the same in early 2013 as in late 2010 , and the possible sidereal values in 2013 being 8.948@xmath00.001 hr ( prograde ) and 8.950@xmath00.001 hr ( retrograde ) ,",
    "we conclude that tempel 2 _ must _ be in prograde rotation , with a sidereal period in late 2010 and in early 2013 of 8.948 hr .    as further evidence that tempel 2 is in a prograde rotation",
    ", we also examined the retrograde scenario .",
    "if it was the retrograde case , then as already stated the sidereal period in 2010 would have been 8.955 hr .",
    "since the difference between the retrograde synodic and sidereal periods in 2013 would be @xmath120.002 hr , we should have measured a period of 8.953 hr . phasing with this value",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig2 ] and it is clear that this solution does not yield a viable lightcurve , therefore the comet must instead be in prograde rotation .",
    "looking back at the earlier apparitions requires disentangling the synodic effects from the actual changes in period due to torquing .",
    "an early attempt to derive the sidereal period from the changing synodic period during 1988 @xcite suffered from several problems , including the claim of a smoothly decreasing period which could not be reproduced during a detailed reanalysis @xcite and our new determination that his synodic / sidereal modeling only included the earth s motion but neglected the dominant solar component .",
    "having now definitively determined the sense of rotation as prograde , we can reexamine prior apparitions .",
    "the computed sidereal periods for each epoch are given in table  [ table3 ] ; for completeness and to illustrate the asymmetries of the pro- and retrograde solutions with respect to the observed synodic periods , we also tabulate the retrograde values .",
    "again , these values differ somewhat from the values given in @xcite since the earth component is now included along with the solar component , thereby causing the asymmetry .",
    "our conclusions regarding a decrease in the amount of spin - down remain unchanged from @xcite , with sidereal periods before perihelia in 1988 of 8.931 hr and in 1999 of 8.939 hr , for an average spin - down by 0.004 hr per apparition .",
    "the same rate of spin - down would have predicted a sidereal period of 8.951 hr in late 2010 , a larger change than we observe .",
    "we continue to think the most likely cause of this is the decrease in total water production from 1988 to 1999 and to 2010 , with lower production rates providing a smaller amount of torquing",
    ". however , within the uncertainties of the period determinations , the data are also consistent with no change in the rate of spin - down .",
    "the agreement between the late 1994 period with early 1999 also remains , with both yielding a sidereal period of 8.939 hr during an interval for which there was not an intervening perihelion passage .",
    "our 2013 lightcurves of tempel 2 revealed two unexpected findings .",
    "first , the amplitude within the lightcurve was smaller than we had assumed it would be and , second , the peak brightness was higher than predicted from earlier apparitions even after compensating for a non - linear phase function .",
    "after considering a variety of possibilities , such as removing too much or too little coma for differing apparitions or systematic effects when different filters were used , we think we have arrived at a self - consistent explanation . our expectations for 2013",
    "were based on assuming that tempel 2 is a prolate ellipsoid with similar dimensions for the small and intermediate axes while the long axis is about 2.1@xmath3 greater .",
    "this is based on the 1988 thermal ir lightcurve from @xcite and that the sub - earth latitude then varied between @xmath121@xmath13 and @xmath129@xmath13 , i.e.  the comet was viewed in 1988 nearly equator - on using our preferred pole solution . in early 2013 ,",
    "the sub - earth latitude was @xmath1247@xmath13 , yielding a predicted amplitude of 0.4 mag , significantly greater than the observed value of @xmath20.2 mag .",
    "if , however , the intermediate axis is actually intermediate in length rather than the same as the small axis , then the total cross - section will appear to increase as one views from more pole - on and the amplitude will become even smaller than the simple function of the cosine of the sub - earth latitude ( the intermediate axis begins to dominate over the small axis ) .",
    "note that in this tri - axial case , it is the ratio of the long axis to the intermediate axis that determines the amplitude for the equator - on view . therefore , to explain the 1988 amplitude , the intermediate axis remains the same as originally assumed for the prolate case , and it is the short axis which must be even shorter . for our observed amplitude in 2013",
    ", this requires the short axis to be less than one - third that of long axis , while the intermediate axis remains at about one - half of the long axis .",
    "this implies an even more elongated nucleus than the tri - axial solution with ratios of @xmath14 proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to explaining the observed amplitude , our tri - axial solution also naturally explains the increased brightness at lightcurve maxima in 2013 as being due to the increased total cross - section relative to the equator - on view .",
    "we strongly suspect , however , that the shape of the nucleus significantly departs from a tri - axial ellipsoid for several reasons .",
    "the lightcurve shape is not sinusoidal , but rather has one  v-shaped minimum and one rounded minimum . also",
    ", the shapes and depths of the minima change rapidly in 2013 with only a small change in viewing geometries even though the sub - earth and sub - solar latitudes did not vary . finally , as discussed below , the amplitudes are quite different when the comet was viewed from high positive latitudes as compared to high negative latitudes .",
    "thus , we conclude that the nucleus must have large - scale protuberances .    to first - order , the tri - axial ellipsoid explains most of the brightness and amplitudes measured at the other apparitions .",
    "most similar to 2013 were the circumstance in early 1987 with a sub - earth latitude of @xmath1252@xmath13 , and where jewitt & meech ( 1988 ) measured an amplitude of @xmath20.3 mag and a peak magnitude essentially identical to our 2013 value once adjustments are made for filter and phase angle .",
    "the 1999 apparition was nearly identical to that of 1988 , and the lightcurve characteristics are also essentially the same .",
    "the peak brightness in 1994 @xcite is also consistent with 1988 and 1999 but the amplitude is somewhat smaller ( by @xmath20.10.2 mag ) with no clear explanation since the sub - earth latitude was close to the equator .",
    "most different were our results from 2010 @xcite , where the peak brightness is @xmath20.20.3 mag fainter while the amplitude is larger than expected for a sub - earth latitude near @xmath1040@xmath13 .",
    "while an over removal of coma might partially explain both aspects , our methodology was the same used for the 1999 apparition which has no such issues , leading us to suspect that tempel 2 s actual shape characteristics are another significant factor ; this is supported by the fact that only in 2010 did the sub - earth latitude have a high positive value ( @xmath1040@xmath13 ) while all other apparitions were either near the equator ( 1988 , 1994 , 1999 ) or at high negative values ( 1987 , 2013 ) .",
    "the observations reported here represent some of the first science collected with lowell observatory s new discovery channel telescope . despite a few problems associated with a facility still in the early stages of commissioning",
    ", we were able to easily fulfill our major science objectives regarding comet tempel 2 s rotational state , in spite of a smaller lightcurve amplitude than expected .",
    "we obtained a precise measurement of its current rotation period that , when combined with our 2010 measurements , yielded a definitive determination of its sense of rotation . this result in turn allowed us to determine the correct sidereal period associated with observed synodic values at each prior apparition . for lowell observatory and its partners ,",
    "a new era has begun in which projects requiring time - intensive or long - duration observations can be accomplished for targets much fainter than have ever been possible . in the specific case of comet nuclei , we can now measure lightcurves of comet nuclei far from perihelion .",
    "the measured periodicity in a nucleus lightcurve depends on the changing cross - section both as illuminated by the sun and as seen from the earth , and in turn depends on the solar day as well as the earth s motion with respect to the comet and the sun .",
    "disentangling these effects from the change in the physical rotation due to torquing had been problematic at best .",
    "however , the relative importance of the solar component and earth s motion component are quite different far from the sun as compared to near perihelion .",
    "because of this , we planned and executed these new observations . the resulting synodic period , 8.948@xmath00.001 hr , matched that expected for the prograde scenario from 2010 while the nominal period associated with the retrograde solution is clearly ruled out .",
    "we therefore conclude that tempel 2 s rotation is prograde with respect to both the ecliptic and to its orbital plane . the sidereal period , 8.948@xmath00.001 hr , is coincidentally identical to the synodic value as the solar and earth components of the synodic period just cancel out during the interval of our 2013 observations .",
    "the new data also confirm that no additional spin - down took place following our late 2010 measurements , consistent with the water production curve showing a near - cessation of activity by that time .",
    "this lack of a change in the sidereal period very late in the 2010 apparition thereby implies that the smaller change in the period per perihelion passage between 1999 and 2010 as compared to 1988 to 1999 is real ( although a constant rate of spin - down can not be excluded within the uncertainties ) .",
    "note that the inferred changes match those given by @xcite for the prograde case .",
    "thus our hypothesis that a decrease in torquing is associated with the secular decrease in water production from 1988 to 2010 is probably correct .",
    "we note , however , that there is no strong evidence for a long - term decrease in activity over the past century , and the secular drop over the past two decades may reverse as the surface is eroded and varying proportions of ice are exposed from successive perihelion passages .    similar to prior apparitions , the light curve is double - peaked with near - equal maxima but quite differently shaped minima .",
    "the shape and depth of one of the minima also changed over the three - month interval , another trait observed in the past .",
    "both characteristics directly indicate that the shape of tempel 2 s nucleus is not a simple prolate ellipsoid or even a triaxial ellipsoid but must instead have large - scale protuberances to cause such clear changes in the lightcurve from such a small change in viewing geometries ( @xmath120@xmath13 ) and essentially no change in sub - earth and sub - solar latitudes .",
    "the unexpectedly small amplitude we measured in the lightcurve ( @xmath20.2 mag ) appears to also be due to peculiarities of the nucleus shape  our value is in good agreement with the only other data obtained at a similar sub - earth latitude @xcite , while data taken from near - equator on or from the other hemisphere all exhibit a much larger amplitude .",
    "the data further suggest that the length of the short axis is substantially shorter than that of the intermediate axis , though the shape is probably not as extreme as that of comet 103p / hartley 2 as imaged from epoxi @xcite .",
    "thus a more complete story of the properties of tempel 2 s nucleus is beginning to emerge . while determining the detailed shape must continue to await an upclose view ",
    "tempel 2 was the proposed target of the planned comet rendezvous asteroid flyby mission more than two decades ago  additional numerical modeling and new investigations from afar can continue to reveal clues to its physical structure and evolving behavior .",
