    "zwicky in 1933 ( @xcite ) found that unseen mass had to be assumed to exist to explain the observational data for the coma cluster .",
    "subsequently , it was discovered that this unseen mass called dark matter had to be incorporated into gravity to explain the rotation curves of galaxies  ( @xcite ) .",
    "underground experiments  ( @xcite ) as well as astrophysical searches have failed to detect dark matter particles .",
    "an alternative explanation for the missing dark matter is to modify newtonian and einstein gravity .",
    "one such fully covariant and lorentz invariant alternative theory is scalar - tensor - vector - gravity ( stvg ) , also know as mog  ( @xcite ) .    mog has passed successful tests in explaining rotation velocity data of spiral and dwarf galaxies  ( @xcite ) ,  ( @xcite ) , globular clusters  ( @xcite ) and clusters of galaxies  ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was claimed  ( @xcite ) that no modified gravity theory can fit the abell 1689 acceleration data without including dark matter or heavy ( sterile ) neutrinos .",
    "the cluster a1689 is important , for good lensing and gas data are available and we have data from 3kpc to 3mpc .",
    "we will show that mond ( @xcite ) does not fit the a1689 acceleration data , nor does the dark matter model based on an nfw mass profile .",
    "however , mog does fit the a1689 acceleration data without dark matter .",
    "we will use the weak field approximation of the theory at astrophysical scales to describe the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",

    "in order to see if mog fits the cluster a1689 data , we employ the normalized acceleration data given by nieuwenhuizen in his fig . 2  ( @xcite ) .",
    "nieuwenhuizen has obtained the acceleration data by using a1689 strong and weak lensing data . in particular , the two - dimensional mass density @xmath15 has been determined by limousin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . from x - ray observations",
    "the electron and gas mass density can be obtained .",
    "we use 59 data points with 12 data points from  ( @xcite ) at radii between 3 kpc and 271 kpc , 20 data points from  ( @xcite ) , which overlap with the data of limousin et al . in the window between 40 kpc and 150 kpc , and 27 data points from  ( @xcite ) , which cover the range between 125 kpc and 3 mpc .",

    "the gas density is  ( @xcite ) : @xmath21    background galaxies are far away from the cluster , so strong lensing can be treated as occurring due to mass projected onto the plane through the cluster center .",
    "the strong lensing yields data for the mass density along the line - of - sight : @xmath22",
    "we investigate the possibility of fitting the a1689 data with mog , mond and with a dark matter model using a nfw profile .",
    "although there are many galaxies in a galaxy cluster , the galaxy mass density of a1689 is dominated by the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in the center of the cluster .",
    "we will use the bcg density profile proposed in  ( @xcite ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the mass and the radial size of the central galaxy , respectively , while @xmath26 denotes its core size . in our calculations",
    ", we use in our bcg mass density profile @xmath27 kpc , @xmath28 kpc and @xmath29 from  ( @xcite ) .    because the bcg is spherically symmetric",
    ", we can use the mog point mass radial acceleration equation ( [ mogpointacceleration ] ) .",
    "we can express this acceleration by the effective equation for @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the baryon mass . by using @xmath33 and integrating @xmath34 over the volume of the cluster , we obtain the mass @xmath35 .",
    "we choose the parameter values : @xmath36 and @xmath37 or @xmath38 kpc .",

    "we have plotted the mog predicted acceleration in fig.1 .",
    "the acceleration data is from  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the acceleration curve for newtonian gravity without dark matter , determined by @xmath39 , is depicted in fig.1 . and does not fit the normalized acceleration data . in the case of mond , we use the following interpolating function @xmath40 to calculate the acceleration : @xmath41 this leads to the mond acceleration : @xmath42^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the predicted mond normalized acceleration curve shown in fig.1 , follows closely the newtonian acceleration curve without dark matter .    to obtain the a1689 dark matter normalized acceleration",
    ", we adopt the nfw profile  ( @xcite ) : @xmath43 the dark matter model acceleration is obtained from @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the dark matter mass .",
    "we have from lensing data for a1689  ( @xcite ) : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . after integrating the nfw profile and calculating @xmath48",
    ", we obtain the acceleration curve depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we have normalized the acceleration in all three cases to @xmath49 .",
    "as can be seen , mog can fit the data points from small to large radii . for the nfw profile dark matter model",
    ", just a part of the data can be fitted for radii @xmath50 200 kpc . to see",
    "if the data can be fitted for smaller radii , we change the value of @xmath51 to fit the model for smaller radii , but then for larger values of the radii the model no longer fits the data .",
    "these results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the mond prediction is the same as the newtonian prediction , and for mond there is no way to fit the data except to include dark matter or heavy sterile neutrinos .",
    "the lensing and the chandra x - ray data can determine the total baryon density for the cluster a1689 . the acceleration for newtonian , mond and mog models is then derived from the baryon mass @xmath35 by integrating the total baryon density , assuming that the bcg is the dominant mass in the a1689 cluster . the normalized acceleration for these models",
    "is then compared with acceleration data for a1689 .",
    "the newtonian and mond predictions without dark matter fall far short of fitting the data at all values of the radial distance @xmath52 . a dark matter model based on a nfw density profile with the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 determined by strong lensing data fits the acceleration data for @xmath55 kpc but not for @xmath52 below this value .",
    "the mog predicted acceleration without dark matter provides a good fit to the data at both small and large values of @xmath52 .",
    "modified gravity theories have been formulated to avoid the need for dark matter .",
    "experiments have failed to detect dark matter particles motivating studying the alternative gravitational theories .",
    "the fully covariant and lorentz invariant mog theory fits galaxy dynamics data and cluster data .",
    "it also fits the merging clusters bullet cluster and the train wreck cluster ( abell 520 ) without dark matter  ( @xcite ) .",
