    "the study of the relation between classical and quantum dynamical chaos has greatly improved our understanding of the behavior of quantum systems .",
    "an issue which may be of interest in several situations is the stability of motion . in this respect , even though liouville equation , which governs the evolution of classical distribution functions , is linear , the exponential sensitivity of classical trajectories with respect to perturbing the initial conditions leads to a strong dynamical instability , and characterizes classical chaos . like the classical liouville equation , the schrdinger equation is also linear .",
    "however , the quantum evolution of states is stable and this qualitative difference is clearly apparent in the loschmidt echo numerical experiments of ref .",
    "the problem of the stability of quantum motion under perturbations in the hamiltonian has recently gained a renewed interest @xcite , also in connection with quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the quantity of central interest in these investigations is the fidelity @xmath0 ( also called loschmidt echo ) , which measures the accuracy to which a quantum state can be recovered by inverting , at time @xmath1 , the dynamics with a perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the main interest has been focused on classically chaotic systems for which , besides numerical experiments , some theoretical tools are available , like random matrix theory and semiclassical methods . however , in the general case , the phase space structure is mixed with chaotic components and islands of stability . if the motion starts inside an integrable island , then it very much resembles the motion in integrable systems .",
    "contrary to chaotic systems , which are dynamically unstable but structurally stable , integrable systems are dynamically stable but very sensitive to external perturbations .",
    "therefore the analysis of the fidelity requires particular care and one may expect it to be dependent on initial conditions and on the type of perturbation .",
    "indeed , the decay of fidelity in integrable systems has been discussed in recent papers @xcite , and very different behaviors have been found .",
    "et al . _ have shown the existence of a regime in which the quantum fidelity for classically integrable systems decays as a power law , with an anomalous exponent of purely quantum origin @xcite .",
    "prosen and nidari have instead discussed a regime in which quantum fidelity exhibits a much faster gaussian decay @xcite .",
    "both regimes have been also discussed by eckhardt in his analysis of the decay of classical fidelity @xcite , in which the problem of the evolution of classical phase space densities has been addressed for linearized flows .    in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss the behavior of fidelity for integrable classical systems . besides being of interest on its own , our classical study will allow us to understand the main mechanisms for the fidelity decay and therefore will constitute a valuable reference point for the quantum analysis . here",
    "we show the existence of a critical border depending on the _ shape _ of the perturbation , which separates two different types of fidelity decay : a power law decay @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimension of the system , and a much faster decay of ballistic type .",
    "we stress that the type of decay depends on initial conditions and on the shape of the perturbation but , for small enough perturbations , not on its strength .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the critical border and our theoretical results are confirmed by a numerical analysis on three different models : the twist map , the rectangular billiard and the kicked rotor .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we develop a general theory for the decay of classical fidelity in integrable systems .",
    "section iii demonstrates numerically the validity of our theory in two different typical examples of integrable systems , the twist map and the rectangular billiard , and in an almost integrable system , the kicked rotor .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "finally , in the appendix a , we discuss the long - time relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "the quantum fidelity is defined as the overlap at time @xmath1 of the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , obtained by the evolution of the same initial state @xmath6 with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath7 and the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the fidelity is then given by @xmath9 this expression can be equivalently rewritten in terms of the wigner functions as @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the number of degrees of freedom . since the wigner functions can be considered as the quantum analogues of the classical phase space densities , we define the classical fidelity as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the square normalized classical phase space densities ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath14 is the classical limit of @xmath0 . as the density evolution is unitary in both classical and quantum mechanics , instead of evolving two densities forward in time and calculating their overlap",
    ", we may first evolve the initial density @xmath15 forward in time with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath7 , and then evolve this density backward in time with the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the density obtained in such a way as @xmath16 .",
    "the fidelity is then given by the overlap of the density @xmath16 with the initial density @xmath15 : @xmath17 such an approach is more convenient for our discussion of the classical fidelity of integrable systems .    for the following discussion",
    "we assume that the perturbation of the integrable system is of the kam type , namely that , for small enough perturbations @xmath18 , most of the tori of the system are only slightly deformed but not destroyed .",
    "therefore for most of the tori the transformation from old action - angle variables @xmath19 to new ones @xmath20 is possible , in such a way that the new actions are constants of motion of the perturbed system . to the first order in the perturbation strength @xmath21 the transformation can be written as @xmath22    after the forward unperturbed evolution up to time @xmath1 we have @xmath23 then we perform a backward evolution of the perturbed system from time @xmath1 to time @xmath24 , getting @xmath25 the frequency vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 characterize the linear ( in time ) evolution of the angle variables in integrable systems .",
    "expressed in the original action - angle variables , the overall evolution can be written as @xmath28 where the error term @xmath29 is due to the change from one set of variables to the other at time @xmath1 and the reverse change at time @xmath24 . since the perturbation is small , we may write the change in frequency as @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the change of frequencies on the unperturbed torus @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives the change of the action variables caused by the perturbation ( written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transi ] ) to the first order in @xmath21 ) .",
    "if we consider the angle variables to be uniformly distributed at the time @xmath1 at which the motion is inverted , we may introduce the distribution @xmath34 ,   \\label{eq : probaction}\\ ] ] which gives the probability density for the transition from the torus characterized by the action variables @xmath32 in the unperturbed coordinates to the torus with action variables @xmath35 in the perturbed coordinates .",
    "the @xmath21 scaling has been chosen in order for the function @xmath36 itself not to depend on @xmath21 in the linear approximation .    in the generic case ,",
    "the motion on a torus is ergodic .",
    "it is , however , not random and therefore , in order for the equation ( [ eq : probaction ] ) to well describe transitions between the tori , one needs to consider an ensemble of tori in the vicinity of the chosen actions @xmath32 , as only for an ensemble of tori with different frequencies we can expect the angle variables to be uniformly distributed after a sufficiently long time @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the spread of frequencies given by @xmath37 translates into the spread of angle variables @xmath38 .",
    "the time for this spread in the angle variable to become comparable to @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the characteristic width of the initial phase space density distribution @xmath15 along the action direction ( to simplify writing , we have given eq .",
    "( [ ttheta ] ) for the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "thus , our theory based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : probaction ] ) is valid for times @xmath42 .",
    "since the final angle variables , after the forward and backward evolutions , depend on the actions of the perturbed system , we compute the distribution of the angle variables from the distribution of the perturbed actions as @xmath43 using the expressions ( [ eq : theta2 t ] ) and ( [ eq : omegaexpand ] ) , we obtain @xmath44 @xmath45^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{{\\bf \\theta}_{0}- { \\bf \\theta}_{2t}+{\\cal o } ( \\epsilon ) } { \\epsilon t}-\\frac{\\delta { \\bf \\omega}}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : main}\\ ] ] this expression is the kernel for the combined forward and backward evolution of the phase space densities .",
    "we assume that the width @xmath41 along the action direction of the initial density @xmath15 is much larger than the change of the action variable induced by the perturbation , that is @xmath46 ( to simplify writing we have given the condition ( [ nui ] ) for the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "therefore the effects of the forward and backward evolutions are felt mainly in the change of the angles variable .",
    "this means that the evolution from the initial phase space density @xmath15 to @xmath16 is given , up to corrections of order @xmath21 , by @xmath47 the fidelity @xmath14 can then be computed by inserting @xmath16 into eq.([fidc2 ] ) .",
    "the kernel @xmath48 is stretched linearly in time , while at the same time it moves ballistically ( linearly with time ) with velocity @xmath49 . under the assumption that the perturbation of the shape of the tori is not divergent ( as it is the case for most of the tori in a kam regime )",
    ", the distribution @xmath50 has a bounded support which is determined by the change of the shape of the tori due to the perturbation .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) that at long times the argument of the function @xmath36 is given by @xmath51^{-1 } ( \\delta { \\bf \\omega}/\\epsilon)$ ]",
    ". therefore the long time behavior of @xmath52 depends on whether the value of @xmath51^{-1 } ( \\delta { \\bf \\omega}/\\epsilon)$ ] falls within the support of @xmath36 or not . in the first case , @xmath53^{-1 } ( \\delta { \\bf \\omega}/\\epsilon))$ ] is different from zero and therefore the kernel @xmath52 drops @xmath2 . in the latter case , @xmath54 , and therefore @xmath52 drops",
    "the transition between these two regimes is determined by the equality @xmath55^{-1 } \\frac{\\delta { \\bf \\omega}}{\\epsilon } , \\label{deltais}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are the coordinates of the border of the support of @xmath36 .",
    "we can therefore draw the following conclusions : if the perturbation of a classical integrable system is such that the primary effect is the change of the shape of the tori , then the expected decay of fidelity is @xmath2 . on the contrary , if the change of the frequencies of the tori is the dominant effect , then we expect a ballistic decay of fidelity , that is the center of mass motion of the phase space densities after the forward and backward evolutions is responsible for a drastic drop of fidelity .",
    "such a decay takes place as soon as the centers of mass of the densities @xmath16 and @xmath15 are separated in the angle variables @xmath57 by more than their characteristic width @xmath58 . as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ fidc2 ] ) , the exact form of the fidelity drop in the ballistic regime depends on the tails of the initial distribution @xmath15 : for instance , a gaussian tail gives a gaussian decay of fidelity , whereas a sharp border induces a sharp drop to zero of fidelity .",
    "finally , it is important to stress that the type of decay , power law or ballistic , depends on initial conditions and on the shape of the perturbation .",
    "however , it does not depend on the strength of the perturbation , provided that it is sufficiently small . indeed , eq .  ( [ deltais ] )",
    "shows that @xmath56 is @xmath21-independent ( to the first order in @xmath21 ) , since @xmath59 .",
    "as a first example we consider the perturbed twist map , defined by @xmath60 where the angle @xmath61 determines the mixture between purely perturbing the shape of the tori ( @xmath62 ) or purely changing their frequencies ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this parametrization allows us to change the type of the perturbation without changing its overall magnitude .",
    "the change of frequency associated with the perturbation is given by @xmath64 the conserved action variable of the @xmath21-perturbed system is , to the first order ( in @xmath21 ) approximation , given by @xmath65 indeed , inserting this expression into the mapping ( [ eq : skew2 ] ) , one can easily verify that @xmath66 .",
    "the transition probability function @xmath67 for this system can thus be obtained by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : probaction ] ) : @xmath68 @xmath69,\\ ] ] which gives",
    "@xmath70 the range of the support of the distribution @xmath67 is between @xmath71 .",
    "the critical value @xmath72 for which @xmath73 is therefore determined by @xmath74    in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew ] we show the numerically computed behavior of fidelity for this system as a function of time for various values of the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we take as initial phase space density a rectangle centered around the point @xmath75 with sides of length @xmath76 .",
    "the perturbation strength is @xmath77 . to compute fidelity",
    ", we follow the evolution of @xmath78 trajectories , which at @xmath79 are uniformly distributed inside the above rectangle .",
    "the fidelity is then given by the percentage of trajectories that return back to this region after the forward and backward evolutions . in all cases",
    "we observe an initial plateau during which the fidelity does not decay appreciably .",
    "this plateau persists until the time @xmath80 at which the width of the kernel ( [ eq : main ] ) or the shift of its center become comparable to the width @xmath81 of the phase space density along the angle variable . in either case",
    "this time is @xmath82 according to eq .",
    "( [ deltais ] ) , we expect the behavior to change from algebraic decay to ballistic one at the value of the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "for the chosen initial conditions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : critskew ] ) gives @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , the change from an algebraic fidelity decay @xmath85 when @xmath86 to a sharp drop of fidelity when @xmath87 is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew ] .",
    "an interesting feature is that , approaching the critical value @xmath72 , we observe that the fidelity decay , power law or ballistic , sets in after longer and longer times .",
    "this fact has a clear explanation : the value @xmath88^{-1 }   ( \\delta { \\bf \\omega}/\\epsilon))$ ] , which determines the long time behavior of the evolution kernel ( [ eq : main ] ) , diverges close to the critical value @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : distskew ] ) ) .",
    "when the fidelity decay is power law , we have @xmath89 , with the constant @xmath90 . since @xmath91 becomes larger and larger close to the critical point , the fidelity decay must be postponed to longer and longer times . on the other hand ,",
    "when the long time fidelity decay is ballistic , we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) that the argument of the function @xmath36 goes outside the support of @xmath36 after a time that becomes longer close to the critical point . only after this time",
    "the fidelity drops off .",
    "of course the decay can not be postponed indefinitely since the exact condition ( [ eq : critskew ] ) can be satisfied only for a single torus , while we always deal with a family of tori upon which the initial phase space density @xmath15 rests .",

    "we simply rescale the time @xmath94 after which the fidelity decay starts , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ tplateau ] ) .    to illustrate the fidelity decay in integrable systems with more than one degree of freedom , we consider the following system : @xmath95 where the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath96 describes the motion of a particle bouncing elastically inside a rectangular billiard and the perturbation is given by @xmath97 again , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath98",
    ", the perturbation mainly affects either the shape of the tori or their frequencies .",
    "we use the first order perturbation theory of hamiltonian systems ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) to determine the effects of the perturbation .",

    "is determined by the equality ( [ deltais ] ) in the direction of the @xmath128 variable .",

    "this theoretical expectation is confirmed by the numerical data of fig .",
    "[ fig : rect ] , which show a crossover from a power law fidelity decay ( for @xmath135 ) to a ballistic decay ( for @xmath136 ) .",
    "the results are very similar to the case of the twist map , including the fact that , close to the critical value @xmath137 , the decay is postponed to longer times .",
    "is should be stressed that the algebraic fidelity decay , differently from the twist map case , is now inversely proportional to the square of the time , in agreement with our theoretical expectation for a two - dimensional system ( see eq .",

    "the @xmath93 curve is shown as a thin dotted line.,width=302 ]    as a last numerical example , we consider the kicked rotor map that is given by @xmath144 @xmath145 as it is known , for @xmath146 the system is almost integrable , namely its phase space is dominated by invariant tori .",
    "there is a stable fixed point at @xmath147 and a separatrix which divides the phase space into two regions : a section of librational motion around the stable fixed point inside the separatrix , and a section of rotational motion outside the separatrix .",
    "we perturb the system by varying @xmath148 .",
    "the important point is that the type of the perturbation chosen strongly affects the frequencies of the tori in the librational section , while it mainly perturbs the shape of the rotational tori .",
    "therefore the same system and perturbation should lead to two completely different types of fidelity decays , power law or ballistic , depending on the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "[ fig : rotor ] confirms this expectation : if the initial density @xmath15 is inside the separatrix the fidelity decay is ballistic , otherwise it is power law .",
    "in this work we have studied the decay of the fidelity of classical motion for integrable systems .",
    "our main result is the following : for small enough perturbations , the type of the decay of fidelity for integrable systems depends not on the strength of the perturbation but on its shape and on initial conditions . more precisely , the fidelity exhibits two completely different behaviors , namely an algebraic decay if the perturbation mainly affects the shape of the tori , and a faster , ballistic decay , if the main effect of the perturbation is to change the frequencies of the tori .",
    "we have also given clear numerical demonstrations of the transition between the two types of behaviors , induced by changing the shape of the perturbation or the initial conditions .",
    "this result poses interesting questions with respect to the quantum mechanical picture . due to the correspondence principle",
    ", there should exist regimes where both types of decay may be observed .",
    "it is however expected that , for small perturbations , quantum mechanics would favor the ballistic type decay , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "indeed the algebraic decay is due to the transitions between tori which , for small perturbations , are suppressed in quantum mechanics , due to tori quantization and subsequent gaps between them .",
    "the classical - quantum correspondence will be the topic of further studies .",

    "the results of the previous sections do not tackle the asymptotic decay of fidelity for integrable systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , we neglected the contributions to the evolution kernel ( [ eq : main ] ) that stem from the fact that the angle variables are cyclic .",
    "this means that , after a time which is @xmath149 , we need to take into account the contributions to ( [ eq : main ] ) not only at @xmath150 but also at all @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is a vector of integer numbers .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of a single torus . of course the fidelity",

    "( [ asymptotic ] ) gives an overall @xmath178 fidelity decay together with a superimposed oscillatory behavior .",
    "this is the typical asymptotic relaxation of fidelity for a single torus in integrable systems with a single degree of freedom .",

    "<S> we study both analytically and numerically the decay of fidelity of classical motion for integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the decay can exhibit two qualitatively different behaviors , namely an _ algebraic decay _ </S>",
    "<S> , that is due to the perturbation of the shape of the tori , or a _ ballistic decay _ , that is associated with perturbing the frequencies of the tori . </S>",
    "<S> the type of decay depends on initial conditions and on the shape of the perturbation but , for small enough perturbations , not on its size . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate numerically this general behavior for the cases of the twist map , the rectangular billiard , and the kicked rotor in the almost integrable regime .    2 </S>"
