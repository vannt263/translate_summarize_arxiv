    "in the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation , gravitational evolution causes dark matter particles to cluster around peaks of the initial density field and to collapse into virialized objects ( haloes ) , which provide the potential wells in which galaxies subsequently form ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "it is therefore expected that the properties of a galaxy are correlated with the properties of its host halo .",
    "small haloes merge to form larger and more massive haloes , which tend to be located in dense environments and are expected to host groups of galaxies .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the mass of a dark matter halo determines how the galaxies it hosts form and evolve ; other halo properties are assumed to be less important at fixed mass .",
    "this assumption is usually made both by those who use halo models of galaxy clustering ( e.g. , zehavi et al .",
    "2005 ; skibba et al .   2006 ; van den bosch et al .  2007 ;",
    "moster et al .",
    "2010 ) and by those who use semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , bower et al .  2006",
    "; de lucia & blaizot 2007 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "2007 ; somerville et al .  2008 ) .",
    "many of such models have recently been able to provide a description , and perhaps a plausible explanation , of various galaxy statistics , such as the luminosity function , stellar mass function , colour - magnitude distribution , correlation function , and mark correlation functions , lending credence to claims about the importance of halo mass .    nonetheless ,",
    "although halo properties , such as their mass , spin , concentration , and shape are correlated with each other , there is considerable scatter in these correlations ( e.g. , avila - reese et al .  2005 ; macci et al .  2007 ;",
    "macci et al .",
    "2008 ; ragone - figueroa et al .",
    "in addition , recent studies of numerical simulations have shown that halo formation time is correlated with the environment at fixed mass ( e.g. , sheth & tormen 2004 ; gao et al .",
    "2005 ; dalal et al .",
    "some have argued that the halo occupation distribution ( used in models of galaxy clustering ) is correlated with formation time at fixed mass ( zentner et al .",
    "2005a ; wechsler et al .",
    "2006 ; giocoli et al .",
    "it has also been argued that such halo ` assembly bias ' affects the clustering of galaxies and that the effect varies with luminosity and colour ( croton et al .",
    "nonetheless , careful studies of the environmental dependence of galaxy luminosity and colour in the real universe have explained this dependence in terms of the environmental dependence of halo mass alone ( e.g. , tinker et al .",
    "2008a ; skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "such models are also encouraged by an analysis of a halo - based galaxy group catalogue , in which , given a halo s mass , the colours of the galaxies it hosts are not significantly correlated with the large - scale density field ( blanton & berlind 2007 ) . in addition , the halo model can reproduce the observed non - monotonic relation between clustering strength and density ( abbas & sheth 2007 ) ; note , however , that assembly bias effects are thought to be stronger for lower mass haloes ( e.g. , croton et al .  2007 ;",
    "wang et al .  2007 ) , which host fainter galaxies than the sdss can reliably probe .",
    "the results of these studies suggest that assembly bias affects the formation of observed galaxies only weakly , if at all , although the debate is not yet resolved .",
    "it is also commonly assumed that typical dark matter haloes are relaxed and in virial equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , macci et al .  ( 2007 ) have shown that many haloes are significantly unrelaxed , sometimes because they are experiencing or have recently experienced a merger or have not yet virialized .",
    "in addition , statistical studies of galaxy groups and clusters have shown that the most massive galaxy in these systems is often significantly offset from the centre of the potential well , which may be an indication that some of the systems are unrelaxed ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2005 ; skibba et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the relation between halo formation and galaxy formation is far from clear , and these issues are in need of further investigation .",
    "for example , to what extent halo mass determines other halo properties , and to what extent relaxed and unrelaxed haloes differ , remains to be seen .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the properties of dark matter haloes in numerical simulations , with principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "this type of analysis allows us to quantify the correlations between the halo properties , determine which properties are the most important , and to what extent halo mass is the dominant property .",
    "it also allows us to characterize the distinctive properties of relaxed and unrelaxed haloes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the dark matter halo simulations in section  [ sec : sims ] . in section  [ sec : pca ] , we describe our principal component analyses and our choice of halo properties to analyze .",
    "we then present the pca results in section  [ sec : res ] .",

    "are identified using a spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm .",
    "we use a time varying virial density contrast determined using the fitting formula presented in mainini ( 2003 ) .",
    "we include in the halo catalogue all the haloes with more than 1000 particles ( see macci 2008 for further details on our halo finding algorithm ) . note that we include only host dark matter haloes in our analysis ; halo substructures are not included .      for each so halo in our sample",
    "we determine a set of parameters , including the virial mass and radius , the concentration parameter , the angular momentum , the spin parameter and axis ratios ( shape ) .",
    "below we briefly describe how these parameters are defined and determined .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in macci ( 2007 , 2008 ) .      to compute the concentration of a halo we first determine its density profile .",
    "the halo centre is defined as the location of the most bound halo particle , and we compute the density ( @xmath19 ) in 50 spherical shells , spaced equally in logarithmic radius .",
    "errors on the density are computed from the poisson noise due to the finite number of particles in each mass shell .",
    "the resulting density profile is fit with a nfw profile ( navarro 1997 ) : @xmath20 during the fitting procedure we treat both @xmath21 and @xmath22 as free parameters .",
    "their values , and associated uncertainties , are obtained via a @xmath23 minimization procedure using the levenberg & marquardt method .",
    "we define the r.m.s . of the fit as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fitted nfw density distribution .",
    "finally , we define the concentration of the halo , @xmath26 , using the virial radius obtained from the so algorithm , and we define the error on @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fitting uncertainty on @xmath21 .",
    "the spin parameter is a dimensionless measure of the amount of rotation of a dark matter halo .",
    "we use the definition introduced by bullock ( 2001 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the mass , total angular momentum and circular velocity at the virial radius , respectively .",
    "see macci ( 2007 ) for a detailed discussion and for a comparison of the different definitions of the spin parameter .",
    "note that the concentration and spin parameters are not well - defined in unrelaxed haloes ; for this reason , most of our analyses in section  [ sec : res ] involve only relaxed haloes .      determining the shape of a three - dimensional distribution of particles is a non - trivial task ( e.g. , jing & suto 2002 ) .",
    "following allgood ( 2006 ) , we determine the shapes of our haloes starting from the inertia tensor . as a first step ,",
    "we compute the halo s @xmath34 inertia tensor using all the particles within the virial radius .",
    "next , we diagonalize the inertia tensor and rotate the particle distribution according to the eigenvectors . in this new frame (",
    "in which the moment of inertia tensor is diagonal ) the ratios @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 ) are given by : @xmath38    next we again compute the inertia tensor , but this time only using the particles inside the ellipsoid defined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . when deforming the ellipsoidal volume of the halo , we keep the longest axis ( @xmath39 ) equal to the original radius of the spherical volume ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we iterate this procedure until we converge to a stable set of axis ratios .    since dark matter haloes tend to be more prolate on average ( e.g. , kasun & evrard 2005 ; bett et al .  2007 )",
    ", a useful parameter that describes the shape of the halo is @xmath43 , with the limiting cases being a sphere ( @xmath44 ) and a needle ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "a related parameter is the triaxiality @xmath46 , which can also be used to quantify the prolateness of haloes , but we find that it yields nearly identical results as the shape parameter , so we choose to use only @xmath47 in section  [ sec : res ] .    note that for haloes that are not spherical , the nfw fit to the density profile could be affected , potentially inducing an ` artificial ' correlation between halo shape and the r.m.s . of the density profile fit . nevertheless ,",
    "although triaxial models are an improvement over spherical profile fits , jing & suto ( 2002 ) have shown that the differences between such fitted profiles are fairly small , and in any case , macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown that there is no significant correlation between halo shape and the r.m.s .",
    "of the spherical profile fit .",
    "we also consider the angle @xmath0 between the major axis of the halo ( @xmath39 ) and the angular momentum vector @xmath48 .",
    "the angle @xmath0 can be thought of as a proxy for the position of a possible stellar disk ( and for the orientation of satellite galaxies ) within the dark matter halo , assuming that the angular momentum of the disk and the one of the dark matter particles will be aligned ( e.g. , sharma & steinmetz 2005 ; zentner et al .",
    "2005b ; heller et al .",
    "2007 ; hahn et al .  2010 ) . nevertheless , it is difficult for simulations to reproduce the angular momentum distributions of observed disk galaxies ( van den bosch 2002 ; sharma & steinmetz 2005 ) .",
    "more recently , heller et al .  (",
    "2007 ) claim to reproduce many of the properties of observed galactic disks , and the angular momentum of their simulated disks follows that of the dark matter and does not decrease too much while the disks form .",
    "agertz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also can reproduce the angular momentum content of disk galaxies by assuming a lower star formation efficiency than other simulations and weaker feedback energy from supernovae .",
    "in contrast , governato et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue that strong outflows from supernovae are necessary to reproduce the angular momentum distribution of dwarf galaxies , and help to yield shallow dark matter profiles .",
    "we note that the shape parameter @xmath47 and @xmath0 are not estimated from all of the particles in a halo , but rather from the halo s best - fit ellipsoid .",
    "nevertheless , for the vast majority of the haloes , these parameters are computed using @xmath49 of the particles , so we expect that this does not affect or bias our results significantly . in addition , observational estimates of the position angles of galaxies also have large uncertainties ( e.g. , barnes & sellwood 2003 ) . in any case , although for a spherical halo @xmath0 will be poorly defined , this does not result in systematic uncertainties in our analysis or in artificial correlations between @xmath0 and halo shape .",
    "finally , in some of our analyses we also consider the overdensity ( @xmath50 ) , computed within a sphere of radius @xmath51 centred on the halo centre .",
    "such an overdensity within a fixed aperture allows us to quantify the large - scale environment of haloes . although most haloes are smaller than 2 mpc/@xmath52 in size ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , it is useful to focus on larger scales , in order to more clearly encompass nonlinear scales within the aperture ( e.g. , abbas & sheth 2007 ) .",
    "we use the 8 mpc/@xmath52 overdensity , @xmath50 , in our analyses in section  [ sec : res ] . in the appendix",
    ", we show similar results for smaller scale overdensities , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "our halo finder , and halo finders in general , do not distinguish between relaxed and unrelaxed haloes .",
    "( although there are recent exceptions , using halo phase - space densities : e.g. , zemp et al .  2009 ; behroozi et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "there are many reasons why we might want to remove unrelaxed haloes .",
    "first and foremost , unrelaxed haloes often have poorly defined centers , which makes the determination of a radial density profile , and hence of the concentration parameter , an ill - defined problem .",
    "moreover unrelaxed haloes often have shapes that are not adequately described by an ellipsoid , making our shape parameters ill - defined as well .",
    "following macci ( 2007 , 2008 ) , we decide to use a combination of two different parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 to determine the dynamical status of a given dark matter halo .",
    "the first quantity @xmath2 is defined as the r.m.s . of the nfw fit to the density profile ( performed to compute @xmath55 ) .",
    "while it is true that @xmath2 is typically high for unrelaxed haloes , haloes with relatively few particles also have a high @xmath2 ( due to poisson noise ) even when they are relaxed ; furthermore , since the spherical averaging used to compute the density profiles has a smoothing effect , not all unrelaxed haloes have a high @xmath2 .    in order to circumvent these problems ,",
    "we combine the value of @xmath2 with the @xmath1 parameter , defined as the distance between the most bound particle ( used as the center for the density profile ) and the center of mass of the halo , in units of the virial radius .",
    "this offset is a measure for the extent to which the halo is relaxed : relaxed haloes in equilibrium will have a smooth , radially symmetric density distribution , and thus an offset that is virtually equal to zero .",
    "unrelaxed haloes , such as those that have only recently experienced a major merger , are likely to reveal a strongly asymmetric mass distribution , and thus a relatively large @xmath1 .",
    "although some unrelaxed haloes may have a small @xmath1 , the advantage of this parameter over , for example , the actual virial ratio , @xmath56 , as a function of radius , is that the former is trivial to evaluate .",
    "in addition , the virial ratio can be quite noisy ( e.g. , macci , murante & bonometto 2003 ) , while the substructure fraction , another proxy for virialization , depends significantly on the simulation s resolution ( macci et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dens ] shows the correlation between @xmath1 ( lower panel ) , @xmath2 ( upper panel ) , and the virial mass of the halo for the w5 - 90.2 box . as already noted in macci ( 2007 ) ,",
    "there is a correlation between the @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) and @xmath2 , which simply reflects the fact that for low halo masses the density profiles are more noisy . in most of our analyses in section  [ sec : res ] , we use a dark matter particle threshold as well as a mass criterion in order to minimize any effect of this correlation on our results .",
    "finally , @xmath1 and @xmath57 are extremely weakly correlated , if at all , and we find no correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .     and @xmath2 and the virial mass @xmath57 .",
    "the two dotted lines represents the limit values used to define ` good ' haloes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    following macci ( 2007 ) , we split our halo sample into unrelaxed and relaxed haloes .",
    "the latter are defined as the haloes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "about 70% of the haloes in our sample qualify as relaxed haloes . in what follows",
    ", we will present results for two different samples of haloes : ` all ' , which includes all haloes with @xmath61 , and ` good ' or ` relaxed ' , which is the corresponding subsample of relaxed haloes .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) is a type of multivariate ( multidimensional ) statistics .",
    "the goal of such an analysis is to find a suitable representation of multivariate data , where representation here means that we somehow transform the data so that its essential structure is made more visible or accessible .",
    "pca belongs to the area of unsupervised learning , because the representation must be learned from the data itself without any external input from a supervising `` teacher '' .",
    "pca is a powerful technique that has been used in classification and dimensional reduction of large data sets , in order to decrease the complexity of the analysis .",
    "each member of a data set ( a dark matter halo , in our case ) is defined by an `` information vector '' , an @xmath62-tuple of numbers ( the halo s relevant properties , in our case ) .",
    "pca consists of de - correlating sets of vectors by performing rotations in the @xmath62-dimensional parameter space .",
    "the final result is a diagonal covariance matrix , with the eigenvalues representing the amount of information ( in the sense of variance ) stored in each eigenvector , which is called a principal component .",
    "the principal components can be considered a set of basis vectors that optimally filter the information hidden in the data .",
    "if most of the variance in the original data can be accounted for by just a few of the components , we will have found a simpler description of the original data set . by convention",
    ", the first principal component corresponds to the largest eigenvalue , the second principal component corresponds to the second largest eigenvalue , and so on .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that the first principal component ( pc ) is a minimum distance fit to a line in the space of the original variables .",
    "the second pc is then a minimum distance fit to a line in the plane perpendicular to the first pc , and so on .",
    "therefore , the properties that dominate the first pc are the properties that contain the largest amount of information and to some extent determine the values of the other properties .",
    "typically the eigenvalue for a pc must be @xmath63 to be significant ; less significant pcs tend to be dominated by noise ( e.g. , connolly & szalay 1999 ) . in any case , the amount of variance that a pc accounts for is more meaningful than the precise value of its eigenvalue . if the data have high signal - to - noise , and if the data are not very incomplete , then the amount of variance of the first few pcs can be associated with ` information ' contained in the data .    in astronomy ,",
    "pca applications in studies of multivariate distributions have been discussed in detail ( efstathiou & fall 1984 ; murtagh & heck 1987 ) .",
    "pca methods have been used to study stellar , galaxy , and quasar spectra ( e.g. , connolly et al .",

    "pca methods have not yet been exploited to analyze the properties of dark matter haloes .",
    "considering the increasing size and resolution of numerical simulations , pca is a useful tool to determine the relative importance of halo properties , and to determine how fundamental the masses of haloes are .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to use pcas to analyze a variety of halo properties , including those introduced in section  [ sec : sims ] .",
    "before we perform our principal component analyses on our simulation data , we subtract the mean from each halo property and normalize by the standard deviation .",
    "it follows that the distributions of the properties may be important : for example , choices about whether to take the logarithm of a property or whether to include objects whose properties are outliers in the distributions may be important .",
    "it is particularly useful to take the logarithm of halo mass , for example , because its range spans many orders of magnitude , and the spin parameter , because this makes its distribution more gaussian ; for consistency , however , we take the logarithms of all of the halo properties in our pca .",
    "we also choose to exclude the extreme outliers ( @xmath64 ) in the distributions of properties .",
    "in addition , some properties are so strongly correlated that one property almost completely determines another ( such as the virial mass , radius and velocity , or spin and angular momentum , or shape and triaxiality ) , and in such a case we include only what we believe is the more important property . by reducing the number of parameters , this tends to clarify the results of the pca .",
