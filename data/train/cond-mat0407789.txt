    "the langevin equation is widely used to describe the motion of stochastic particles.@xcite in a typical situation a brownian particle is driven by the random force originated from collisions of molecules in the environment and the friction force proportional to the velocity of the particle .",
    "the friction force is not always proportional to the velocity of particles .",
    "a well - known counter example can be found in the dry friction of macroscopic materials , _ so called _ coulomb friction in which the dynamical friction is independent of the speed of a material but depends on the direction of the motion.@xcite in general , the motion of such the material obeying coulomb friction is not affected by the thermal fluctuations , because the material is too large to be fluctuated by the thermal force . however , if the material we consider is enough small like a nanomaterial or the thermal fluctuation is replaced by the mechanical fluctuation force , coulomb friction force with fluctuating random force may be relevant . in a recent paper , in fact , kawarada and hayakawa@xcite",
    "suggest that langevin equation associated with coulomb friction can be an effective equation in a vibrating system of granular particles through their simulation of granular particles .",
    "they demonstrate that ( i ) granular particles in a quasi - two - dimensional container obey an exponential velocity distribution function ( vdf ) , ( ii ) the exponential vdf is produced by coulomb slip between particles and fixed scatters because their simulation without coulomb slip produces a gaussian - like vdf , ( iii ) langevin equation with coulomb friction produces an exponential vdf , and ( iv ) the relation between the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and the granular temperature @xmath1 in their simulation obeys @xmath2 as is expected from langevin equation with coulomb friction .",
    "their result may encourage us to look for relevancy of such langevin equation in physical systems , and investigate mathematical properties of the equation .    in this paper , we investigate mathematical properties of langevin equation with coulomb friction .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our model . in section 3 ,",
    "we obtain the steady vdf under the influence of the steady external field . in section 4",
    "we discuss our result through the comparison of our result with the simulation of driven granular particles in a quasi - two - dimensional box . in the final section",
    ", we conclude our results .",
    "let us consider the motion of a particle whose velocity is @xmath3 subjected to the dynamical coulomb friction force @xmath4 with the mass @xmath5 .",
    "when we assume that the motion is affected by the external force @xmath6 and the uncorrelated fast agitation by the environment , the equation of motion is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the random force whose @xmath9 component is assumed to satisfy @xmath10 here @xmath11 represents the average over the distribution of the random variable @xmath8 and the diffusion constant @xmath12 in the velocity space satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the temperature defined from the second moment of vdf as @xmath14 . since we assume that higher order correlations of @xmath15 vanish , langevin equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be converted into fokker - planck equation for the probability function @xmath16 : @xmath17 here @xmath16 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath18 kawarada and hayakawa@xcite indicate that eq.([eq3 ] ) without @xmath6 has the steady solution obeying an exponential vdf .",
    "namely , the vdf approaches @xmath19\\ ] ] as time goes on , where @xmath20 .",
    "thus , our system has completely different properties from those in the conventional langevin model .",
    "it is convenient to use dimensionless distribution function . for this purpose",
    ", we may introduce @xmath21 with the normalization @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dimension , and @xmath24 is the scaled vdf without @xmath6 .",
    "we adopt @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 in eq.([scale-2 ] ) , because the determination of the scaled factor is difficult if we use @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is the function of @xmath6 and can not be determined without the complete form of vdf .",
    "let us consider the situation that a particle is moving under the influence of @xmath27 with the unit vector @xmath28 parallel to the direction of the external force and coulomb friction force associated with the random force .",
    "we assume that the system is a two - dimensional one , because the particle is typically located on a substrate when coulomb friction is important .",
    "we are interested in the statistical steady state in the balance between the friction and the external force .",
    "let @xmath29 be the angle between the direction we consider and @xmath28 , the steady equation becomes @xmath30 = \\zeta\\{\\frac{p}{v}+\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v}\\}+ d[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2}+\\frac{1}{v}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v } + \\frac{1}{v^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}]p,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",
    "now we assume the expansion @xmath32 here the terms with @xmath33 are irrelevant , because the contribution of @xmath33 is orthogonal to those of @xmath34 , and the effect of gravity appears in the term of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the normalization ( [ eq - norm ] ) is reduced to @xmath36 and eq.([eq2 - 1 ] ) becomes @xmath37 = \\zeta[\\frac{p_0}{v}+p_0'+(\\frac{p_1}{v}+p_1')\\cos\\theta ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + d[p_0''+\\frac{p_0'}{v}+(p_1''+\\frac{p_1'}{v})\\cos\\theta   -\\frac{p_1}{v^2 } \\cos\\theta],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . from the integrations of eq.([eq2 - 3 ] ) multiplied by @xmath42 with @xmath34 over @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 equation ( [ eq2 - 4a ] ) can be integrated easily as @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "we can check that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the solution of ( [ eq2 - 4a ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 4b ] ) which correspond to the steady solution ( [ steady - sol ] ) at @xmath49 .    to solve eq.([eq2 - 4b ] ) we adopt the form @xmath50 and substitute this into ( [ eq2 - 5 ] ) , eq.([eq2 - 5 ] ) is reduced to @xmath51 with the aid of eqs.([eq2 - 6 ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) , eq.([eq2 - 4b ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .    since we do not know the general procedure to obtain the solution of the third order ordinary differential equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) and it may not be easy to get the numerical solution for eq.([eq2 - 8 ] ) around the singular point @xmath54 , we rewrite it as a set of the second order differential equations under the assumption of small @xmath55 . for this purpose ,",
    "we expand @xmath56.\\ ] ] here the prefactor is determined by the normalization ( [ eq2 - 2a ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the series of equations : @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we also assume @xmath59 which ensures that the normalization condition ( [ eq2 - 2a ] ) is satisfied for any @xmath55 .    equations ( [ eq2 - 10a ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 10b ] ) have a common homogeneous part supplemented by the inhomogeneous parts in the right hand sides .",
    "thus , at first , let us obtain the solution of the homogeneous equation : @xmath60 the solution of eq.([eq2 - 12 ] ) can be obtained by the method of a series - expansion around the singular point @xmath54 .",
    "the result is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is euler s constant @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the exponential integral function .",
    "here we use frobenius method and bessel s formula@xcite @xmath65    the general solutions of inhomogeneous equation ( [ eq2 - 10a ] ) or ( [ eq2 - 10b ] ) is given by the sum of a special solution of the inhomogeneous equation and the linear combination of the homogeneous solutions ( [ eq2 - 13a ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 13b ] ) .",
    "for @xmath66 it is easy to confirm that the special solution @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 on the other hand , the leading order contribution @xmath69 should be canceled in the linear combination of @xmath70 and @xmath71 to obtain the finite result for @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we obtain the solution as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant .",
    "we should note that @xmath75 approaches @xmath76 in the limit of @xmath77 .    from the integration",
    "we obtain the first order solution as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant and @xmath80 is meijer s g function@xcite which satisfies @xmath81 from the normalization condition ( [ eq2 - 11 ] ) constants @xmath74 and @xmath79 in eq.([eq2 - 18 ] ) become @xmath82 respectively . here",
    "we use @xmath83 from the formulae@xcite @xmath84    using this distribution function , the mobility @xmath85 defined through @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where we use @xmath88@xcite .",
    "now , we comment on the dimensionless forms of our result obtained here . with the aid of ( [ scale-1 ] ) and ( [ scale-2 ] ) , it is easy to check @xmath89 becomes @xmath90 in the scaling form .",
    "in addition , the prefactor @xmath91 in ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) becomes @xmath92 .",
    "figure 1 plots the scaled @xmath93 and @xmath94 as functions of @xmath95 .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath94 ( dashed line ) as functions of @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes @xmath93 or @xmath94 in the figure .",
    "for @xmath94 we plot @xmath97 to remove the effect of the expansion parameter @xmath55 .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "let us discuss our result .",
    "first , we can obtain higher order terms such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , because the homogeneous solutions in eqs.([eq2 - 13a ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 13b ] ) can be used in any order .",
    "however , these solutions may have complicated forms and we had better use numerical integrations to represent inhomogeneous terms . because of the limitation of the length of this paper , we have omitted to give the explicit forms of higher order terms here .",
    "second , kawarada and hayakawa@xcite assume that the diffusion coefficient in the real space is proportional to the diffusion constant in the velocity space , but this assumption may not be true for our case .",
    "let us briefly evaluate the diffusion constant in the real space as follows .",
    "the basic equation is @xmath100 where @xmath101",
    "now , we introduce the projection operator @xmath102 with the aid of mori - zwanzig projection method@xcite , in general , the distribution function obeys an identity @xmath103 where @xmath104 . it is easy to show that the first and the last terms of right hand side of ( [ projection ] ) are zero if the initial distribution is proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath106 can be regarded as the pertubation of @xmath107 because the distribution function is unchanged within the mean - free path of particles .",
    "thus , we may replace @xmath108 by @xmath109 in the second term of right hand side of ( [ projection ] ) . noting @xmath110 with @xmath111 , eq.([projection ] )",
    "may be reduced to @xmath112 in the long time limit @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the diffusion coefficient in the real space may be @xmath114 .",
    "we should note that this procedure is not exact because @xmath113 does not ensure the approximation @xmath115 for large @xmath116 .",
    "however , the treatment may be plausible and is contradicted with the previous result of simulation of granular particles .",
    "we also note that the behavior of vdf under the influence of @xmath117 in granular particles does not coincide with the theoretical prediction presented here quantitatively .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 have peaks around @xmath120 and become negative near @xmath121 .",
    "the behavior of the simulation for granular particles is qualitatively similar , but the peak position is located near @xmath122 and the negativity in the vicinity of @xmath121 is not large in the simulation .",
    "thus , we will have to check whether the connection between langevin equation with coulomb friction and the vibrated granular particles confined in a quasi - two - dimensional box is superficial .",
    "the detailed quantitative comparisons will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed the theory of langevin equation with coulomb friction and obtained the steady solution of vdf under the influence of a steady external field .",
    "we also discuss the relation between our system with the vibrated granular systems confined in a quasi - two - dimensional box    we would like to thank a. kawarada for fruitful discussion .",
