    "therefore , by measuring the total geo - neutrino flux , it is possible in principle , to determine the contribution of radiogenic heat released in radioactive decays , quoted in eqs .",

    "[ eq : geo1 ] , [ eq : geo2 ] , [ eq : geo3 ] .",
    "even though the geo - neutrino flux at the earth surface is some @xmath8@xmath9s@xmath10 , their detection is challenging as antineutrinos interact with matter only through the weak interaction , thus the probability of such interactions , and possible detection , is very small .",
    "the cross section of the main detectable interaction of electron - flavor antineutrinos , the inverse beta decay interaction : @xmath11 is @xmath12@xmath13 at 2mev  @xcite and increases by about an order of magnitude at 3mev .",
    "the kinematic threshold of this interaction is 1.806mev .",
    "thus , the geo - neutrinos produced in the @xmath3k decays can not be detected , as their end - point energy spectrum of @xmath71.31mev ( see fig .",

    "geo - neutrinos travel almost undisturbed through the earth with a finite , albeit small , probability to interact in scintillation liquids contained in kiloton - scale detectors installed in underground laboratories .",
    "therefore , these particles are unique direct probes , which bring information from the earth s internal regions not accessible by any other means .",
    "importantly , the measured flux at a detector is proportional to the abundance and distribution of u and th in the earth , critical inputs for many geological , geophysical , and geochemical models that describe the complex processes taking place inside the earth .",
    "the geo - neutrino signal is especially useful for providing insights into the radiogenic power of the deep mantle , which is not directly obtainable from other methods .",
    "some information on the chemical composition of the upper mantle can be obtained from samples brought to the surface through volcanic and tectonic processes .",
    "the chemical composition of such samples , however , can also be altered during their transport , particularly so for mobile elements like k , th and u. the lower mantle is completely inaccessible by means of direct sampling .",
    "a systematic study of geo - neutrinos can provide constraints on a broad range of questions in earth sciences , including defining the energy available to drive plate tectonics , critically testing compositional models of the present - day mantle , determining the contribution of the radiogenic heat to the total terrestrial surface heat flux , providing insights into the power generating the geo - dynamo , the earth s magnetic field , and establishing the relative abundance of th and u in the silicate earth and its th / u ratio , as compared to that in some meteorites ( useful contribution for the understanding of the solar system and the earth formation ) .",
    "as it is understood , observations of the chemical behavior of th and u over a wide range of conditions inside the earth are consistent with radioactive elements being absent from the earth s core .",
    "however , some authors  @xcite suggest the existence of a georeactor active in the earth s central inner core and such theories can also be tested by means of detecting electron antineutrinos .",
    "the very low neutrino cross section and the geo - neutrino relatively low energy require that the detectors have special properties , such as a large size and a very low radioactive background .",
    "these requirements necessitate advanced technologies and considerable efforts to achieve detection success .",
    "therefore the experiments capable to study the earth s geo - neutrino flux are few and it is not easy to set up other detectors in different regions of the world .",
    "such detectors are placed in underground laboratories to shield the experimental setup from cosmic radiations , which can mimic antineutrino interactions    the results of geo - neutrino measurements can be expressed in several ways .",
    "one such expression is the normalized event rate .",
    "it can be expressed using the so called terrestrial neutrino unit ( tnu ) , which is the number of antineutrino events detected during one year on a target of @xmath19 protons ( @xmath71kton of liquid scintillator ) and 100% detection efficiency .",
    "conversion between the signal @xmath20 expressed in tnu and the oscillated , electron flavor flux @xmath21 is straightforward and requires a knowledge of the geo - neutrino energy spectrum and the interaction cross section , which scales with the energy of the electron antineutrino : @xmath22 = 4.07 \\times \\phi ( ^{232}\\rm{th})~~[10 ^ 6   \\rm{cm}^{-2 } \\rm{s}^{-1 } ] \\label{eq : tnufluxth}\\ ] ] @xmath23 = 12.8 \\times \\phi ( ^{232}\\rm{th})~~ [ 10 ^ 6   \\rm{cm}^{-2 } \\rm{s}^{-1 } ] \\label{eq : tnufluxu}\\ ] ] this paper provides a state - of - the - art perspective on the new interdisciplinary field of neutrino geoscience , which involves , bringing together , communities of earth scientists and particle physicists . in sec .",

    "geo - neutrinos are electron antineutrinos that are naturally emitted during beta decays and their detection can in principle tell us about the amount of thorium and uranium inside the earth . in turn , measuring the earth s flux of geo - neutrinos will constrain the nature of materials that were available to construct the planet some 4.5billion years ago at one astronomical unit ( au ) out from the sun .",
    "collaboration between geologists and physicists has at least a 150year history that has yielded exciting new science discoveries .",
    "when lord kelvin began to consider the age of the earth and the rate of heat dissipation from the planet , a constrained but unsolved problem , he posed the problem as one of simple conductive dissipation of heat .",
    "a central question in geology today is what proportion of the present day surface heat flux of the earth is due to radiogenic heating and how much is due to the release of primordial heat left over from accretion and core differentiation ?",
    "the assembly of the earth from the initial solar nebular involved the accretion of many cosmic gas - dust fragments that accreted into planetesimals and into an ever increasing hierarchical accumulation of mass .",
    "there was a considerable amount of accretional energy that accompanied planet assembly .",
    "likewise , the settling of metal into the center of the earth during core formation involves the accumulation of gravitational energy that is later dissipated as thermal energy . collectively , this formative period of the earth produces a highly energetic thermal state whereby heat dissipation is regulated by the structure of the earth involving a thermally conductive , metallic core surrounded by an insulating oxide shell .",
    "understanding the age of the earth from the perspective of a simple cooling solid is not an accurate reference frame , as was assumed by lord kelvin .",
    "the dissipation of heat from the earth is in large part controlled by heat loss across a thermal boundary layer that surrounds at least two convective shells , the plastically deforming convecting mantle and the liquid outer core , shells with markedly different thermal properties .",
    "as later recognized by ernest rutherford , radiogenic heating plays an additional , albeit minor role in this story .",
    "thus , to understand the earth s energy budget requires an assessment of the relative contributions of primordial and radiogenic heat and defining of the rate of heat dissipation .    fortunately , geo - neutrino studies offer yet another opportunity for a fruitful collaboration between geology and physics to address the issue of how much radiogenic heat is contained in the earth .",
    "early results from this field are overwhelmingly positive , in that they define the earth as containing a complement of both primordial and radiogenic power , and are beginning to resolve the absolute amount of radiogenic power inside the earth .",
    "this latter information is important for critically evaluating models regarding the building blocks available to construct the earth .",
    "the new , interdisciplinary field of neutrino geoscience is now providing critical insights into the bulk composition of the earth , as well as the energy to power mantle convection , plate tectonic and geodynamo .",
    "additional recent reviews of this field , particularly from the perspective of the geological inputs and how different models of the earth influence the prediction of detected geo - neutrino signal , are also available  @xcite .",
    "there is considerable debate surrounding discussions on the age , origin and composition of the earth .",
    "increasingly , as we gain observational information from stellar nurseries , accretion disks , extra - solar planetary systems and meteorites , we are presented with a variety of potential processes and materials that can be envisaged for the building blocks and processes involved in planetary growth .",
    "today questions remain about whether or not the earth has a chondritic composition , and if so , which of the chondrites were the essential building block of the earth .",
    "chondrites are primitive , undifferentiated meteorites ( i.e. , a chaotic assemblage of rock and metal ) that are a collection of the earliest formed material in the solar system .",
    "studies of meteorites add much to our understanding of the age of the solar system and the nature of the building blocks that makes up the planets .",
    "the earliest formed fragments of the solar system ( i.e. , calcium - aluminum inclusions ) , found in some of these chondrites , are high temperature ceramic grains up to a cm across and represent nebular condensates , which experienced a series of post - formational histories that include chemical exchange in the nebular between gas and condensate , shock heating and melting events and oftentimes secondary mineral formation . from these fragments and other observations we know that the solar system formed 4.568 billion years ago  @xcite due to the gravitational collapse of a portion of a large molecular cloud that formed a pre - solar nebula , a rotating and collapsing disk where much of the mass collects into the central portion that becomes increasingly hotter . further out from the center of the disk",
    "the planets formed by collisional accretion and gravitational attraction , ultimately coalescing to form ever larger bodies .",
    "the how and when planets formed remains a subject of considerable debate .",
    "did jupiter form first and other planets later ? did the inner rocky and outer gas planets formed simultaneously or sequentially ?",
    "the grand tack model  @xcite envisages jupiter and the outer gas giants as having accreted in the first few million years of the solar system : these bodies then moved inward towards the sun , perturbed the region of the inner solar system , which lead to the formation of the inner rocky bodies , and later these gas giants returned to their more distant positions , after having gravitationally filtered this inner pool of planetesimals and initiating accretion of the rocky planets .",
    "theoretical studies envisage the hierarchical growth of the inner rocky planets from the aggregation of planetesimals into planets with the exchange of different components ( refractory versus volatile components , metals versus silicates , etc ) across different heliocentric zones .",
    "these processes can be modeled and the results having attributes consistent with the compositional heterogeneities seen in the inner solar system and with acceptable solutions for the distribution of planetary masses  @xcite .",
    "chondritic meteorites are a mixture of silicate and metal materials in proportions similar to that found in the terrestrial planet ( i.e. , the mass fraction of the metallic core and rocky shell of the mantle and crust ) .",
    "it has also been shown that the compositions of the most primitive of the chondritic meteorites , the c1 carbonaceous chondrite , matches that of the solar photosphere  @xcite , the outer `` surface '' layer of the sun , and that this match ranges over five orders of magnitude in element concentration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sunci ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the solar photosphere is significant , given that the mass of the solar system is the sun , with jupiter being a thousand times smaller than it and the earth being another thousand times smaller still .",
    "thus , chondrites represent a guide to the building blocks of the solar system .",
    "there are a various types of chondritic meteorites , with their classification being established on petrographic grounds that relate to their oxidation state of iron , their amount of iron , and metamorphic grade ( or degree of aqueous alteration ) of their constituent minerals .",
    "there are several varieties of chondritic meteorites , but the three dominant groups include the carbonaceous chondrites ( e.g. , with sub - groups labeled ci , cm , cv , co , cr , ck , with distinctions being due to mineral attributes ) , the ordinary chondrites ( i.e. , h , l and ll , distinguished by their high , low and very low iron contents ) and the enstatite chondrites ( i.e. , eh and el , and again distinguished by their high and low iron contents ) and these varieties are notable for their redox state of iron , being oxidized , intermediate and reduced , respectively .",
    "this redox state of iron also couples to a number of chemical and isotopic attributes of these chondrites  @xcite , where iron is in the oxide form and associated with silicates ( the major mineral family ) or iron is in the reduced or sulfide form , with enstatite chondrites having negligible iron in the silicates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ureycraig ] ) .",
    "a simple compositional model for the earth ( red star fig .  [ fig : ureycraig ] ) compared to chondrites is plotted given the mass of the core and the amount of iron in the core and the bulk silicate earth ( i.e. , the bse is the crust plus the mantle , which is the primitive undifferentiated silicate fraction of the earth , after core subtraction ) .",
    "importantly for the earth , the redox state of iron controls the size of the core , which is 1/3 the mass of the planet .",
    "moreover , the differentiation of the earth into the core , silicate earth ( mantle plus crust ) and hydrosphere / atmosphere , appears to have been a relative early earth process ( i.e. , mostly completed in the first 50million years or thereabouts ) .",
    "evidence for the timing of core formation comes from the short - lived @xmath24hf-@xmath24w isotope system ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 = 8.9million years ) , with both chondrites and iron meteorites having distinctly lower @xmath24w/@xmath27w isotopic compositions than the silicate earth , implying a young formation age ( order ten or a few tens of million of years after the formation of the solar system ) , which is based on the number and timing of separation steps of extracting w into the core and leaving hf in the silicate earth  @xcite .",
    "although the models differ on the exact timing and the number of multi - stage steps involved in its evolution , there is increasing consensus that core formation effectively occurred as early as 11million years after solar system formation or as late as @xmath74.50ga , with the latter being constrained by the ages of the earlier minerals on earth and the time of moon formation , which created a moon having an identical isotopic composition as that of the earth .",
    "the segregation of iron ( and ni ) into core is the single most important chemical differentiation event that occurred on earth and it established to a first degree the distribution of elements in the planet .",
    "historically , emil wiechert , a german physicist and geophysicist , envisaged the first order structure of the earth in 1897 , with the earth having a metallic core surrounded by a silicate shell . by 1913 ,",
    "his phd student beno gutenberg defined the depth to the core mantle boundary at 2900 km , roughly the same depth to which it is known today ( 2893 @xmath28 5 km ) . with this perspective , coupled with the planet s moment of inertia and an understanding of meteorites , scientists compared the earth to the heavenly objects falling upon it , the chondrites .",
    "however , these comparisons lead to much speculation about the appropriate analogs of planets .    at a simple level the bulk of the earth",
    "can be described by four elements ( i.e. , o , fe , si and mg ) , which make up about 93% by mass of the planet . in combination with al , ca and ni , these seven elements describe more than 98% of the mass of the earth and thus define the bulk of the system .",
    "of these seven elements , ca and al play a crucial role and their abundances can be directly linked to that of th and u , as these four elements , along with some thirty other elements are considered refractory elements .",
    "the refractory elements are those elements that condense out of a nebular disk at high temperatures and empirically are observed in equal proportion in the chondrites .",
    "thus , chondritic ratios are conserved for the refractory elements , whereas the relative abundances of the other five abundant elements in the earth ( i.e. , o , fe , si , mg , ni ) and the remaining non - refractory elements vary markedly between different types of chondrites . consequently ,",
    "if we can establish the absolute abundance of th and u in the planet , we can use chondritic ratios of refractory elements to set their abundances and from that model the remaining abundances of the other elements .",
    "importantly , if we could determine the absolute abundances of potassium , a moderately volatile element , in the earth , we could establish the volatility curve for the planet .",
    "( geo - neutrinos from @xmath3k have energies below the kinematic threshold of the current detection interaction , the inverse beta decay . )",
    "collectively , the abundance of the volatile lithophile elements establishes the planet s volatility scale and provides a constraint on the time - integrated nature of material accreted at1 au .",
    "relative to c1 carbonaceous chondrites the earth is strongly depleted in volatile elements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : volatility ] ) . not only does this include the ices ( i.e. , compounds of h , c , n and o ) , but also included are the alkali metals , s , and other non - refractory elements . the short - lived ( 3.7million years ) radioactive system @xmath29mn , which decays to @xmath29cr , has been used to document that the earth s volatile depletion signature , like that of various meteorites , was established within two million years of the start of the solar system  @xcite .",
    "thus , the earth s building blocks were likely volatile depleted and so much so that we do not have an analogous example among the chondritic meteorites .",
    "in addition to considering the behavior of elements ( i.e. , refractory versus volatile ) in the nebular disk , geologists classify elements according to their geochemical affinities during geological processes , with elemental affinities cast according to partition functions with metal ( _ siderophile _ ) , silicate ( _ lithophile _ ) , sulfides ( _ chalcophile _ ) , and water and gases ( _ atmophile _ ) .",
    "hence , inventories of siderophile elements are stored in the earth s core , with minor amounts in the mantle , while the chalcophile elements were divided between the core and mantle@xcite . core formation was likely protracted over one to a few million year time scale and it occurred over a range of conditions , but , on average , appears to have been established at mid - mantle pressure and temperature and a dominantly reduced oxygen fugacity  @xcite .",
    "this scenario of core formation is derived from combining data on the absolute and relative abundances of elements in the silicate earth and in chondrites , with experimental observations that establish the thermodynamic behavior of elements in analog material at controlled pressure , temperature and gas fugacity conditions in the laboratory .",
    "the depletion of siderophile and chalcophile elements in silicate earth is accounted for by their sequestering into the core . to different degrees",
    "the siderophile and chalcophile elements have dissimilar geochemical affinities , as can be observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : volatility ] ) from the distinctive depletions of the two refractory elements mo and w and the highly siderophile noble metals .",
    "the lithophile elements , those that partition into silicates and other oxides , are excluded from the core forming metals due to their chemical affinities for oxygen .",
    "however , these potentials are established by the ambient oxygen fugacity at the time of metal silicate equilibrium and it is possible that during core formation some nominally lithophile elements may have been reduced to their metallic state . therefore , a fraction of the inventory of some lithophile elements may be found in the core .",
    "experiments that mimic a range of core forming conditions even in the presence of sulfide bearing metal find that u has negligible affinities for a core forming metal  @xcite ; the conditions for forcing th into a metal phase are more extreme than that for u  @xcite and thus even less likely to be in the core .",
    "although debate surrounds the potential for th and/or u being partitioned into the core  @xcite , three significant observations are inconsistent with such assertions , given the earth has a chondritic th / u value of 3.9 @xmath28 0.3 : ( 1 ) the average mantle th / u ratio is @xmath73 based on ocean island basalts  @xcite and mid - ocean ridge basalts  @xcite , ( 2 ) the continents , the complementary reservoir to the mantle , has an average crustal th / u ratio of between 4 and 5 , based on studies of crustal rocks  @xcite , and ( 3 ) the time integrated @xmath30 value ( a measure of the @xmath2th/@xmath1u from the slope of @xmath31pb/@xmath32pb ) of mantle and crustal rocks is @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the earth is a differentiate planet made up of three shells : a metallic core , overlain by a rocky layer of mantle and crust , which is in turn surrounded by an outermost fluid layer of hydrosphere and atmosphere ( see table  [ tab : earth ] ) for further details ) .",
    "this structure is a consequence of the physical and chemical processes that occurred early in earth s history , particularly with an initial core formation .",
    "the fundamental result of planetary differentiation is that element distribution in the earth is not random , but controlled by a combination of chemical and physical potentials .",
    "although dense iron is at the earth s gravitational center , other heavy elements like uranium and thorium are concentrated upwards in the mantle and more so in the continental crust due to their chemical properties .",

    "the scintillator will be purified to reach a good radiopurity ( the goal would be @xmath7@xmath178g / g ) , but because the radiopurity of the vessel is not very high , a definition of a fiducial volume , lower than the scintillator sphere , seems needed .",

    "the expected geo - neutrino signal in sno+ is dominated by the contributions from the crust and the lithospheric mantle of the canadian shield . according to huang et al .",
    "@xcite the lithosphere produces a total signal @xmath183 = 36.7@xmath184tnu , which comes mainly from u and th of the local precambrian rocks and paleozoic sediments .",
    "rmek  @xcite recently proposed an exhaustive analysis of geo - neutrino rates from different mantle structures based on three classes of bse models ( i.e. cosmochemical , geochemical and geodynamical ) .",
    "a present depleted mantle produces in sudbury the minimum geo - neutrino signal , corresponding to 2.3 - 3.7 tnu .",
    "this contribution is less than 10% of the crustal geo - neutrinos and it will be unlikely investigable in sno+ . on the other hand , a mantle model having a high urey ratio ( e.g. 0.6 - 0.8 ) could be an intensive source of geo - neutrinos , which can reach rates of 11.2 - 16.1tnu in sudbury .",
    "such high contribution will not be hidden even in sno .",
    "on this ground the regional contribution to the geo - neutrino flux and its uncertainties needs to be determined including the geological , geochemical and geophysical information of the canadian shield . on the base of the refined reference crustal model  @xcite the u and th in the crust of @xmath185 region , surrounding the detector , gives a signal of @xmath186 = @xmath187tnu , which is more than that expected by the whole mantle based on a cosmochemical bse model .",
    "the main reason of such high contribution is the crustal thickness ranging between 44.2 km and 41.4 km : this reservoir is approximately 40% thicker than the crust surrounding the gran sasso and kamioka sites .",
    "moreover , excluding a thin layer ( @xmath653 km ) of paleozoic sedimentary rocks southward the grenville front , a large portion of crystalline basement ( e.g. grenville province , yavapai and mazatzal terranes ) contains significant quantities of felsic rocks , which are enriched in u and th comparing to most other lithologies .",
    "a possible enhancement of crustal geo - neutrinos is due to high concentration of u and th in the sudbury basin as reported in  @xcite on the base of geothermal arguments .",
    "in particular these authors focus on heat flux anomaly of 43 - 60mw m@xmath188 which is significantly higher than the average for the canadian shield ( 42mw m@xmath188 ) . assuming a homogeneous moho heat flux throughout the canadian shield  @xcite the higher heat flux measured in this area",
    "can be explained as a local enrichment in crustal radio - elements within a 50 km radius from sno lab .",
    "it could strongly affects the geo - neutrino signal expected in sno+ . in this framework a detailed calculation of the local geo - neutrino flux , relying on direct summation of the individual contribution of all the geological units , is desirable and partially anticipated by huang  @xcite .",
    "sno+ is expected to start the data taking in 2014 - 1015 .",
    "lena is an ambitious proposal for a large , 50 kton liquid scintillator detector  @xcite having the geo - neutrino measurement among one of their scientific goals .",
    "the project is a part of the european laguna design study and it identifies itself as a multipurpose neutrino observatory .",
    "a combination of an unprecedented volume with the high radio - purity comparable with that , which has been reached by borexino , would provide a unique tool for a wide variety of measurements both in neutrino physics and in testing possible physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the detector should be a vertical cylinder containing the target of 100 m height and 26 m diameter .",
    "the liquid scintillator would be separated from a 2 m thick not scintillating buffer liquid by a thin nylon vessel .",
    "the scintillation light would be viewed by 30 to 50,000pmts mounted on a steel cylinder containing the organic liquids . in the 100kton water cherenkov detector ,",
    "a muon veto system would surround the steel cylinder , being equipped with about 3000pmts , and an array of plastic scintillator panels necessary for the reconstruction of muon tracks in such a huge volume .",
    "the mostly discussed possible future locations are pyhsalmi in finland and frjus in france .    considering the @xmath189 crustal map and the mean chemical compositions of the main crustal layers , and the bse models for the estimation of the mantle contribution , the expected geo - neutrino signal at pyhsalmi is @xmath190tnu , while for the frjus site is @xmath191tnu . in both cases , a detailed analysis of the contribution from the local crust surrounding",
    "the detector would be important in order to further constrain the expected signal and to better interpret the possible measured signal .",
    "lena would detect about 1000 geo - neutrino events per year .",
    "the main antineutrino background , namely that from the nuclear power plants , would be several times smaller in the finland location : this would make it a preferable location from the point of view of the geo - neutrino measurement . in the geo - neutrino energy window",
    "the expected reactor antineutrino signal would be about 20 to 37tnu ( depending on the construction of several new power plants in finland ) , while it would be about 145tnu at frjus , based on the thermal power of nuclear power plants as reported in 2009 .    assuming @xmath192 target protons , a light yield of 400photons / mev , the chondritic th / u mass ratio of 3.9 , and the borexino radiopurity ( no - background approximation ) , the geo - neutrino flux would be determined with a few percent precision within the first few years , an order of magnitude improvement than the current experimental results .",
    "thanks to the high statistics , lena would be able to measure the th / u ratio of the local geo - neutrino signal with unprecedented precision , reaching , after 3 years , 10 - 11% precision in phyahsalmi and 20% precision in frjus .",
    "hanhano is a proposed 10kton liquid scintillator detector designed to be deployed in the deep ocean at 3 to 5 km depth  @xcite .",
    "a tank of 26 m in diameter and 45 m tall would be placed vertically on a 112 m long barge with 32 m beam .",
    "this proposal aims to measure geo - neutrinos and to have a potential to measure neutrino mass hierarchy if the neutrino mixing angle is relatively large ( as it was recently proven to be  @xcite ) .",
    "since the oceanic crust is thin and depleted in u and th with respect to continental crust ( on which all other existent and proposed projects able to measure geo - neutrinos are placed ) , the dominant contribution of about 75% of a measured geo - neutrino signal would come from the mantle .",
    "thanks to a large volume the expected rate would be about 100 detected geo - neutrinos per year .",
    "since the ocean sites are far away from nuclear power plants , only about 12 reactor antineutrinos per year would be detected , so the signal - to - background ratio would be high .",
    "this would in turn make possible to measure also the th / u ratio of the measured mantle signal at the level of 10% precision within few years .",
    "in addition , this detector should be portable in a sense that after an operation at one site , it could be brought to the surface and transported to a new site where it would be again lowered to ocean floor .",
    "as extensively supported by recent papers  @xcite a movable deep - ocean detector could be the next challenge for measuring anthropic and terrestrial antineutrinos , especially for testing mantle lateral homogeneity in composition and the thermochemical evolution of the earth .",
