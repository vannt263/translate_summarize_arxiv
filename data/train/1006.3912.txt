    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provides a very different view of the interstellar medium ( ism ) than is possible either from observations of the milky way ( mw ) or of other , more distant galaxies . at a distance of 50 kpc @xcite , it is far enough that we can get an overview of processes in the entire galaxy but close enough that we can distinguish between the different sources , particularly because of the low inclination angle of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the most comprehensive survey of dust and gas in the lmc has come from @xcite using a variety of sources including new observations with the _ spitzer space telescope_. they found that there was a modification of the dust population in the lmc as compared with the milky way , perhaps through the erosion of large grains in the ism .",
    "the first imaging observations of the lmc in the ultraviolet ( uv ) were by @xcite using the s201 far ultraviolet ( fuv ) camera during the _ apollo 16 _ mission followed by @xcite from a rocket experiment and @xcite from the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) _ on board the space shuttle _ columbia_. observations of the diffuse uv light track the transfer of radiation from the stellar radiation to the interstellar medium with the absorbed radiation re - emitted as thermal emission in the infrared .",
    "the diffuse uv radiation is about 25% of the total radiation emitted from the lmc @xcite and understanding its distribution is important to models of galactic evolution .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the rocket - borne _ wide - field imaging survey polarimeter ( wisp ) _ to map the scattered light in the near ultraviolet ( 2150  ) , finding that the scattered light is actually a complex combination of the relative geometry of the dust and the stars .",
    "it is not sufficient to merely have bright stars or to have dust : both must be present to show the scattered light . in this work",
    ", we use serendipitous observations made with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ to report , for the first time , measurements of the diffuse fuv ( 1000 - 1150  ) emission in an external galaxy .",
    "the _ fuse _ spacecraft and its mission have been described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of the mission was to take high resolution spectra ( @xmath1 @xmath2 20,000 ) of galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "_ fuse _   included 3 apertures : the hirs ( @xmath3 x @xmath4 ) ; the mdrs ( @xmath5 x @xmath4 ) ; and the lwrs @xmath6 x @xmath7 ) , all of which obtained data simultaneously .",
    "although only the lwrs with its relatively large field of view was useful for diffuse observations , there were many fields in which the primary aperture was either the hirs or the mdrs leaving the lwrs aperture ( separated from the other two apertures by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) to observe a nominally blank region of the sky .",
    "@xcite have described the analysis of these serendipitous background observations and we have followed their extraction of diffuse surface brightnesses from the _ fuse _ spectra , except that we have used the latest version of the data pipeline software ( calfuse v3.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this involved treating _",
    "fuse _ as a broad band photometer and collapsing the spectra into two wavelength bands per detector , excluding the terrestrial airglow lines ( primarily ly@xmath10 ) .",
    "this resulted in seven wavelength bands with effective wavelengths of 1004   ( 1a1 ) , 1058   ( 1a2 ) , 1117   ( 1b1 ) , 1157   ( 1b2 ) , 1159   ( 2a1 ) , 1112   ( 2a2 ) , 1056   ( 2b1 ) .",
    "the instrumental background was derived from strips off the spectrum and subtracted from the band fluxes .",
    "our wavelength bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] on top of a spectrum of the diffuse emission in n11 , one of the brighter diffuse regions of the lmc .",
    "the integrated flux of each band is marked by a solid circle at its effective wavelength .",
    "there are more than 600 _ fuse _ pointings in and around the lmc and we have examined all for suitability for diffuse measurements .",
    "we immediately rejected all observations which specifically observed a bright star in the lwrs aperture but there were others where a star was coincidentally in the aperture .",
    "these were identified and rejected through their fwhm , which is less than 20 pixels for a point source but about 30 pixels for an aperture filling diffuse source .",
    "we were finally left with 81 observations of the diffuse radiation in different parts of the lmc .",
    "these observations are from two classes of targets : observations of point sources through either the mdrs or hirs apertures ; or calibrations where the apertures were pointed at nominally blank areas of the sky in order to allow the spectrographs to thermalize before an instrumental realignment . as a result ,",
    "our locations were generally around popular targets in the lmc such as 30 doradus and n11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these are tabulated in table [ tbl-1 ] ( see the online version of the journal for the complete table ) .",
    "we have plotted the diffuse flux in one of the _ fuse _ bands ( 1b1 at 1117  ) as circles with areas proportional to the observed surface brightness in fig .",
    "there is an excellent correlation between the diffuse fuv flux observed in 1b1 and each of the other bands with linear correlation coefficients of better than 0.9 in each case and a similar plot would be obtained for any of the other bands .",
    "the intensities range from around @xmath11 photons @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 @xmath13 to as high as @xmath14 photons @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 @xmath13 near 30 doradus .",
    "although we have listed all the diffuse values for completeness , we note that the effective lower limit for the detection of diffuse radiation with fuse is about 2000 photons @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the lmc is at a high galactic latitude where the contribution from the galactic diffuse radiation will be relatively small and we have estimated it to be on the order of 500 photons @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 @xmath13 , based on nearby voyager observations by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that their diffuse light ( 2150  ) was dominated by the n11 complex in the northwest lmc with a surface brightness of 10@xmath15 photons @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 @xmath13 , which they identified as a giant reflection nebula .",
    "although , certainly bright in our _ fuse _ observations , by far the brightest of our observed regions is around 30 doradus ( the tarantula nebula ) , which was not observed by _",
    "wisp_. as mentioned above , the _ fuse _ targets have been selected for their proximity to bright stars and , as a result , almost all of our observed diffuse regions are also bright .",
    "the fuv diffuse emission in the lmc is predominantly due to the scattering of the star light from the ob associations and shows a large variation in a small angular scale , particularly in 30 doradus and n11 regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these regions are rich in hot ob stars of uv magnitudes less than 10 @xcite and show significant variation in stellar density in a small angular scale .    of the 81 _ fuse _ locations , 43 overlapped with 10 _ uit _ field of observations in the lmc and we have found a strong correlation between _ fuse _ and _ uit _ diffuse flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , where the uit fluxes have been integrated over the @xmath7 x @xmath7 fuse aperture .",
    "three points in the 30 doradus region have a relatively higher fuse flux because the radiation field is dominated by o stars in the nebula whereas one observation in n11 had a relatively higher uit flux because the stellar spectrum is much flatter than in other regions . rather than deal with absolute values ,",
    "a useful comparison is to find the fractional amount of diffuse radiation in the field defined as diffuse radiation over total radiation ( diffuse + stellar ) in each of the uit regions , as was done by @xcite .",
    "we used the stars from his catalog , translated them into the fuse spectral range assuming kurucz models @xcite and summed the fluxes in a given field . with the observed fuse / uit diffuse ratio",
    ", we could then calculate the total amount of diffuse radiation in each of the fuse bands and thus the fraction of total light emitted as diffuse emission .",
    "these fractions range from 5% to 20% of the total at 1100  , with a high of 45% in the superbubble n70 , with an observed error of 12  17% .",
    "the comparable estimate for the milky way is 10% @xcite .",
    "although some part of the variation of diffuse fraction in different regions of the lmc may be due to the dust distribution , it is likely that much of the stellar radiation is non - local , as noted by @xcite ; i.e. , the diffuse light may come from stars far away from the observed area . in our galaxy , this is seen as scattering of galactic plane star light by high latitude dust clouds @xcite ; in the lmc , light from the ob associations will be scattered by distant dust .",
    "the shape of the diffuse fraction ( diffuse radiation over total radiation ) is essentially the same in all the 10 regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) rising by a factor of about 5 from 1000 to 1500  , implying that most of the heating of the interstellar dust comes in the fuv .",
    "this is consistent with the lower albedo ( dashed line ) and higher cross - section ( dot - dash line ) of the grains in the fuv .",
    "@xcite have attempted to model the distribution of diffuse light in the _ wisp _ data by scattering the light of ob associations in the lmc from a dust distribution which decays exponentially with radius and with a hyperbolic secant with distance from the plane .",
    "they found that although their models did match the overall morphology of the observations , it was difficult to constrain the parameters because of the uncertainty in many of the physical properties of the ism in the lmc , particularly in its clumping .",
    "nevertheless they did find that 30 doradus dominated the diffuse emission in the eastern lmc , a conclusion borne out by our _ fuse _ observations in the fuv .",
    "we have obtained the first fuv ( 1000  1150  ) spectra of the diffuse radiation in an external galaxy using serendipitous _ fuse _ observations of targets in the lmc .",
    "most of these observations are near ob associations and the diffuse emission is bright , ranging from 5% to 20% of the total flux in the region .",
    "this fraction is much less than the corresponding fraction emitted at 1500    suggesting that the largest part of the heating of the interstellar dust occurs in the fuv .",
    "we are now building a more detailed model to use the wealth of data now available in the lmc , particularly the data from _ spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "the uv and ir data are complementary in that they probe different aspects of the radiative transfer between stars and the dust with the part of the radiation not scattered in the uv radiated in the ir and an understanding of the absorption and subsequent re - emission of the starlight in a nearby galaxy such as the lmc will provide templates for more distant galaxies where only the convolution of the two is seen .",
    "this research has made use of _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ data .",
    "_ fuse _ was operated by johns hopkins university for nasa .",
    "we acknowledge the use of nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) .",
