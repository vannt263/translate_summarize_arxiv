    "interstellar dust provides a source of attenuation of the light from galaxies , but also a source of information on their metal content , and , possibly , a tracer for the molecular gas content @xcite . on average ,",
    "about 50% of the uv  optical light from galaxies is re - processed by their own dust into the mid / far  infrared and mm wavelength range @xcite .",
    "determining accurate dust masses for galaxies has been , traditionally , a difficult step since measurements at infrared wavelengths shorter than @xmath9100200  @xmath0 m ( as accomplished by iras , iso , and the spitzer space telescope ) are sensitive to the inferred dust mean temperature(s ) and the adopted dust emissivity .",
    "wavelengths longer than a few hundred @xmath0 m probe the long wavelength tail of the modified planck function for typical galaxy dust emission , and the inferred dust masses are , therefore , less sensitive to the dust temperature .",
    "wavelength measurements also offer additional leverage for constraining , when used together with shorter wavelength infrared data , the dust temperature itself .",
    "recent applications of sub  mm data used to constrain the properties of the dust emission from galaxies include a nearby sample of about 100 galaxies observed at 450  @xmath0 m and 850  @xmath0 m with scuba ( the scuba local universe galaxy survey , a.k.a . , slugs , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and an additional @xmath920 galaxies from the sings sample ( the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where spitzer data in the range 3160  @xmath0 m have been combined with scuba 850  @xmath0 m detections @xcite .",
    "more recently , sub  mm data have been combined with spitzer data for 11 nearby galaxies from the slugs sample @xcite , thus increasing the total number of galaxies for which the dust masses are measured accurately from multi ",
    "wavelength spectral energy distributions , spanning from the mid  ir to the sub  mm .",
    "the slugs galaxies tend to have , on average , colder dust temperatures than the galaxies in the sings sample ( of which ngc 1512/1510 is part ) , as estimated by @xcite on the basis of the far  infrared / sub  mm colors .",
    "the spitzer data on nearby galaxies offer the unique opportunity to analyze the dust emission characteristics not only of whole galaxies , but also within sub  galactic regions , thanks to its angular resolution in the range 2@xmath1138@xmath11 for the 3160  @xmath0 m range .",
    "we combine the sings data on the interacting galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510 with data at 1.1  mm wavelength from aste / aztec , which has 28@xmath11 resolution , to investigate the infrared / mm spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust for those two galaxies , and for regions within the larger ngc 1512 .",
    "our goal is to derive accurate dust masses for the two galaxies , and to compare the seds between sub - regions .",
    "the interacting pair ngc 1512/1510 is of particular interest because its two member galaxies are remarkably distinct in nature : the primary galaxy , ngc 1512 , is a large , metal - rich barred spiral , while its companion , ngc 1510 , is a low metallicity blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy ( table  [ tab1 ] ) which is expected to have less ability of self - shielding for the dust .",
    "both galaxies are characterized by intense starburst activity in their central regions , and do not show evidence for presence of agns .",
    "this pair is thus ideal for investigations of dust seds , and their dependence on each galaxy s properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the data and , for the aste / aztec data , provides some detail on the observations and data reduction ; section 3 is devoted to the data analysis , including the photometry , and photometric corrections and uncertainties ; section 4 presents the dust model fitting and results ; the discussion and conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "spitzer maps with both the irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0 m ) and mips ( 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 m ) are available for both galaxies , through the high level data products of the sings legacy project ( spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although the sings observations targeted ngc 1512 only , its companion galaxy is serendipitously present and detected in the same maps .",
    "the sings observation strategy , data reduction procedures , and map sensitivity limits are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath92@xmath11 for the four bands and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m bands , respectively ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "aztec is a 144 element bolometer array currently configured to observe in the 1.1  mm atmospheric window  @xcite .",
    "observations of ngc 1512 were made with aztec on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using a network observation system n - cosmos3 @xcite , which provided a @xmath15 circular main beam . during the period",
    "711 october 2007 we performed 25 lissajous observations identical to those described in @xcite centered on ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the coaddition of the 25 observations results in a roughly circular map with uniform coverage over the central 18@xmath17 diameter with a depth of @xmath181.5 mjy .",
    "the structure of ngc 1512 is well resolved , with a maximum signal - to - noise ratio @xmath910 in the core , and @xmath98 on the arms ; its companion , ngc 1510 is detected with only marginal significance with a peak signal - to - noise of @xmath93.5 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "atmospheric emission at 1.1  mm is the dominant noise source in our aztec maps .",
    "previous images made with the standard aztec pipeline @xcite are optimized for point source recovery and consequently do not preserve extended flux in the image .",
    "we have developed our own iterative flux recovery technique that takes advantage of the fact that the atmospheric noise is not correlated between the 25 observations and that the atmosphere is transient in time while the astronomical signal is stationary .",
    "we begin by using a variant of the principal component analysis ( pca ) technique described in @xcite to remove atmosphere from the detector time streams . rather than the aggressive form of filtering described there  which would result in a sharp spatial filter applied to this map  we project just two eigenmodes from the detector ",
    "detector correlation matrix out of each 15 second span of time ",
    "ordered data .",
    "this relatively weak filter is comparable in strength to a subtraction of the array average and gradient from each detector timestream sample .",
    "once these initial `` cleaned '' data streams are produced we implement the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "a coadded image of the field is made from the cleaned data streams .",
    "the fluxes from pixels within 24@xmath11 of pixels with s / n@xmath102.5 are preserved in the cleaned image while all other pixels are set to zero .",
    "we call this the `` current best sky '' image since it is the best estimate we have of a ( noiseless ) sky .",
    "the `` current best sky '' image is recast into the time streams of the detectors and subtracted from the original detector time streams , creating a set of residual time streams that , in principle , have the same contamination from the atmosphere but less true astronomical signal .",
    "we call these the `` residual observations '' .",
    "the `` residual observations '' are cleaned and mapped .",
    "the resulting image is added to the `` current best sky '' image and a new `` current best sky '' realization is produced using the same pixel flux criteria as before .",
    "this iterative process continues until no new pixels in the realization pass the pixel flux criteria .",
    "6 .   at this point",
    "the severity of atmospheric filtering is increased .",
    "that is , another detector - detector covariance matrix eigenvector is projected out of the pca basis for the atmospheric cleaning and the iterations continue .",
    "iterations are complete when the full pca technique for optimal point source detection is realized ( in this case cutting 7 eigenmodes in the atmosphere cleaning step ) and no new pixels pass the pixel flux criteria @xcite .",
    "one benefit of this technique is that it results in a set of 25 residual timestreams that have been effectively `` cleared '' of astronomical signal while leaving a good approximation of the true atmospheric contamination behind .",
    "we take advantage of this by injecting various forms of simulated signals into these residual timestreams in order to perform tests on the effectiveness of the iterative flux recovery technique .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the results of injecting a flux ",
    "scaled version of the mips 24  @xmath0 m map of ngc 1512 , smoothed with a 28@xmath11 gaussian , into our residual timestreams and then repeating the identical analysis that was done for the aztec ngc 1512 observations . the residual map is consistent with the noise level in the aztec ngc 1512 image and shows only minor residual systematics of order 12 mjy at the locations of the cores of ngc 1510 and ngc 1512 .",
    "we perform the same aperture photometry analysis on the residual map shown in figure  [ fig2 ] as is done for the actual map ( see section 3.3 ) and find that our iterative flux recovery technique misses between 0.2% and 12% of the integrated flux depending on the scale - size of the aperture .",
    "these values are small compared to the total integrated flux and calibration uncertainty ( 17.1%  128% , see the next section ) .",
    "in addition to measuring the fluxes from the whole galaxies , the infrared and mm maps have sufficient angular resolution to allow us to isolate substructures within the larger of the two galaxies , ngc 1512 .",
    "we thus identify three separate subregions in this galaxy : the center , and two areas in the spiral arms ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) . for each of these regions , we define circular or ellipsoidal apertures , depending on the structure we are measuring .    for ngc 1512 as a whole ,",
    "we define an elliptical aperture ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , with major / minor axes @xmath19 and centered on the galaxy position defined in ned ; the aperture s major and minor axes are matched to the optical major and minor axes and the position angle extracted from the kpno / ctio _ bvri _ imaging campaign for the sings project ( table  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for ngc 1510 , which is unresolved in the mips and mm images , and",
    "only marginally resolved in the irac bands , we define a single , circular aperture , with diameter 108.4@xmath11 , centered again on the ned position of the galaxy .    the size and location of the photometric apertures for the substructures in ngc 1512 are more arbitrary in nature , and we define them based on the 1.1  mm map , taking also into account the lower resolution of the 160  @xmath0 m image .",
    "the central region is defined by a circular aperture centered on the ned galaxy center , and with diameter 73.6@xmath11 , delimited by the size of the central emission region which is similar in the maps of the two longest wavelengths .",
    "the location and size of the two apertures along the spiral arms ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) are chosen to encompass as much as possible of the northeastern and southwestern arm regions , while minimizing overlap with the central region .",
    "the arm apertures are thus elliptical in shape with major / minor axes 174@xmath11/78@xmath11 .",
    "a constant background is determined and subtracted from each spitzer image , using the peak value of the background pixels distribution ( see description in * ? ? ?",
    "the 1@xmath20 uncertainty of the background band is , in unit of mjy sr@xmath21 , [ 0.008 , 0.012 , 0.052 , 0.053 ] for irac [ 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 ]  @xmath0 m , and [ 0.039 , 0.36 , 0.48 ] for mips [ 24 , 70 , 160 ]  @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "after background subtraction , photometric values are determined for each of the five regions in each band .",
    "our photometric measurements require a few corrections , due to the presence of : mips flux non  linearities , psf wings outside the apertures , and , for irac , scattered light for extended sources .",
    "1.1mm aste / aztec data require no aperture corrections .",
    "mips 70  @xmath0 m pixels with surface brightness above @xmath966 mjy sr@xmath21 are subject to non  linearities that need to be corrected .",
    "the central pixel of ngc 1512 is above this threshold , and we adopt the non  linearity correction formula published in @xcite ( equation 3 ) , which is deduced from data given in @xcite .",
    "a correction factor of 1.011 is derived for the photometry of the whole galaxy , and 1.023 for its central region .",
    "the extended source aperture corrections provided by the science center for irac gives [ 0.911 , 0.941 , 0.798 , 0.745 ] for ngc 1512 , [ 0.928 , 0.960 , 0.901 , 0.791 ] for its central region , [ 0.919,0.949 , 0.866 , 0.770 ] for the north arm , [ 0.919 , 0.949 , 0.866 , 0.770 ] for the south arm and [ 0.920 , 0.950 , 0.869 , 0.771 ] for ngc 1510 at [ 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 ] @xmath0 m respectively , with an average uncertainty @xmath910% .",
    "we adopt the mips aperture corrections ( [ 1.04 , 1.05 , 1.06 ] at [ 24 , 70 , 160 ] @xmath0 m for ngc 1512 given in @xcite . for the other apertures we evaluate the corrections by measuring the wings of mips psfs for the relevant aperture sizes . the aperture correction for the central region of ngc 1512 and for ngc 1510",

    "we derive aperture corrections of [ 1.04 , 1.08 , 1.28 ] for the arm regions , which are roughly extrapolated from circular apertures inscribed and circumscribed to the minor and major axes , respectively , of the aperture ellipses .",

    "in this analysis we employ the upper limits of those ranges . for mips data , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are adopted at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath0 m respectively @xcite .",
    "the aztec / aste 1.1 mm image calibration has an uncertainty of @xmath98% .",
    "aperture corrections are @xmath910% uncertain for irac channels .",
    "for the mips bands , the aperture correction uncertainties are as small as a few percent , and our estimates of [ @xmath25 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 at [ 24 , 70 , 160 ] @xmath0 m are close to previous estimates @xcite .    the background noise levels in the images are found by performing a gaussian fit of the pixel - value distributions . for the millimetric image , we test for false detections and fluctuations by performing photometry of the background in the map using @xmath98000 slightly displaced consecutive apertures ( with the same area as each of the apertures used for source photometry ) to cover the whole image , but excluding sources and the map edges .",
    "a gaussian fit is then applied on the resultant histogram of `` background '' photometry and the dispersion of the background fluctuation is obtained accordingly .",
    "this strategy results in relative 1-@xmath20 total uncertainties at 1 mm ( errors in absolute flux calibration and background estimation added in quadrature ) of 17.1% ( whole ) , 20.9% ( core ) , 24.8% ( northeast arm ) , 26.7% ( southwest arm ) for ngc 1512 , and 128% for the entire ngc 1510 .",
    "total uncertainties computed in this fashion are listed in table  [ tab2 ] for all the irac , mips and aztec bands .",
    "the silicate  graphite  pah dust model of @xcite is used to fit , via @xmath27 minimization , the flux densities of the two galaxies and of three sub - galactic regions in all eight bands .",
    "parameters in the models are : the pah mass fraction @xmath28 , the lower cutoff of the starlight intensity distribution , and the fraction of the dust heated by starlight .",
    "the dust composition is assumed to be a mixture of carbonaceous grains and amorphous silicate grains , with size distributions consistent with the observed extinction curve in the local milky way @xcite , along with varying amounts of pah molecules .",
    "all charged pahs ( singly or multiply , positively or negatively ) of a given size are assumed to have the same cross sections , but those of neutral and ionized pahs are assumed to be different .",
    "this model employs a fixed shape for the pah size distribution , a fixed pah ionized fraction , and a fixed spectral shape of the illuminating starlight , which result in fixed ratios of pah emission band strength .",
    "the stellar continuum contributing to the mid  infrared emission is approximated by a 5000  k blackbody @xcite .",
    "the comparison between data and best - fit models are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , together with the resulting model parameters .",
    "the seds of ngc 1512 and its regions are well represented by the models , yielding dust masses @xmath29@xmath92.4@xmath210@xmath3  m@xmath4 for the whole galaxy , and in the range @xmath926@xmath210@xmath30  m@xmath4 for the regions within the galaxy ( see table  3 ) , using the distance listed in table  1 .",
    "ngc 1510 is less well fit by the model , mainly owing to the combination of a high 70/160  @xmath0 m ratio ( which implies a high effective dust temperature ) together with a highly uncertain 1.1  mm flux ( whose value would imply presence of large amounts of cooler dust , see below ) . despite the uncertainties , the models still provide a reasonable fit to the ngc 1510 sed , with a resulting dust mass @xmath29@xmath91.7@xmath210@xmath5  m@xmath4 , or about 150 times less dust mass than its companion galaxy",
    "this difference is reduced to a factor of 45 , if we use the upper bound of the large uncertainty in ngc 1510 s dust mass determination .    as a test",
    ", we have also fit the far  infrared ( 70 and 160  @xmath0 m ) and mm data to a very simple prescription of two modified blackbodies , with temperatures and relative intensities derived through @xmath27 minimization ( table  4 ) .",
    "the power - law index of the dust emissivity is fixed to the value @xmath31=2 , following the conclusions of both @xcite and @xcite who determine that this value produces better fits to the seds of the galaxies they consider than lower power - law index values .",
    "overall , this is a very crude prescription , with 4 free parameters ( warm dust temperature , @xmath8 , cool dust temperature , @xmath32 , the relative contribution of the two dust components to the observed infrared ",
    "mm sed , and the total luminosity ) , thus the fit is not constrained by our three data points ( 70  @xmath0 m , 160  @xmath0 m and 1.1  mm ) .",
    "indeed , we only derive these quantities for comparison purposes .",
    "however , in order to guide our physical intuition , we use the masses derived through the physical models of @xcite as our `` target values '' for the simple two  temperature prescription . for both galaxies and all regions ,",
    "we find that the colder of the two temperatures is in the range @xmath32@xmath91416  k ( table  4 ) . as a comparison , within the context of @xcite model , seeing that stronger radiation fields result in hotter dust grains , the lowest dust temperature can be inferred from the lower cutoff of the starlight intensity distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the best  fit model of the whole ngc 1512 is parameterized by @xmath33=0.7 , corresponding to a lowest dust temperature @xmath916  k , which is consistent with our result of two  temperature fittings as mentioned above .",
    "while for ngc 1510 , @xmath33=8.0 and therefore a lower temperature limit is found to be 24  k , which is somewhat higher than that of the cooler dust component ( @xmath915  k ) obtained with the two  temperature fitting strategy . however , we do not regard this as a discrepancy , given that the 1.1  mm data point of ngc 1510 is highly uncertain and that both temperature values are still consistent with the fact that active star  forming galaxies appear to have cool dust components with temperatures of  order 20  k ( see the discussion section ) . for the warmer dust component , we have a markedly different behavior for the two galaxies : ngc 1512 and its regions are described by `` warm '' dust temperatures in the range @xmath8@xmath92025  k , with the higher value being associated with the central region of the galaxy ; ngc 1510 requires a warmer temperature than ngc 1512 , @xmath8@xmath936  k , to fit its sed .",
    "this is a well  known result : low  mass galaxies tend to have higher effective dust temperatures than large spirals @xcite .",
    "the total dust masses derived with the two  temperature method are higher than those derived from the more accurate fits using the @xcite models , by a factor 1.62.5 in ngc 1512 , and by a factor @xmath99 in ngc 1510 , or 2.8 if the upper bound of its dust mass is applied ( table  4 ) .",
    "assumptions of lower dust emissivity would yield even higher dust masses from the two - temperature method than those derived with the @xcite method ( see the conclusions ) . for ngc 1512 as a whole",
    "the warmer dust component includes @xmath97% of the total dust mass in the galaxy , and the dominant contributor by mass is the cooler dust component ( table  4 ) .",
    "however , in the sub  galactic regions of ngc 1512 , the warm dust represents a larger fraction of the total dust mass , between @xmath917% and @xmath940% .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the sub ",
    "galactic regions have been selected to encompass actively star forming areas in the galaxy , and are likely biased towards higher warm dust contents than the average across ngc 1512 . in ngc 1510 the mass  dominant dust component is the cool one , with a mass that is about 36 times larger than that of the warmer component ; this is perhaps not surprising as the higher warm dust temperature for this galaxy relative to ngc 1512 naturally leads to a much higher emissivity , corresponding to much smaller warm dust mass .",
    "finally , we remark again that the results for this galaxy are highly uncertain , due to the low  significance of the mm flux determination .",
    "the availability of mm observations for the nearby , star  forming galaxy pair ngc",
    "1512/1510 indicates that the observed infrared / mm sed of both galaxies and of the three sub ",
    "galactic regions in ngc 1512 analyzed in this paper are consistent with the presence of a relatively cool dust component ( @xmath32@xmath91416  k , figure  [ fig3 ] ) , if a power - law index of the dust emissivity @xmath31=2 is assumed .",
    "presence of a non ",
    "negligible cool dust component with temperature below 20  k has already been suggested for nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite . in m31 ,",
    "a cold dust component with a temperature of 16@xmath12  k seems to be present as well @xcite . confirming the actual existence of this component in our case is difficult , due to the crudeness of the two  temperature models and to the sparseness of the sed sampling .",
    "in general , data between 160  @xmath0 m and @xmath91  mm are not available for galaxies , although a few galaxies ( including ngc 1512 ) have been recently observed at wavelengths between 250  @xmath0 m and 500  @xmath0 m with blast @xcite , and more will become available thanks to the observations with the herschel space telescope .",
    "interestingly , even very actively star forming galaxies , like lirgs and ulirgs , do seem to require some cool dust component , with temperature of  order 20  k , about a factor 22.5 smaller than the temperature of the warm dust component that dominates the total luminosity @xcite .",
    "the observed far  infrared / mm seds of the two galaxies can not be easily fit by a single modified blackbody , without requiring that the dust has a power ",
    "law index @xmath342 : ngc 1512 requires @xmath31@xmath91.3 and ngc 1510 @xmath31@xmath91.1 , the latter value being at the margin of the acceptable range for dust emissivity ( 1@xmath35@xmath31@xmath352 , seki & yamamoto 1980 ) .",
    "less stringent are the fits of the sub  galactic regions ,",
    "where the single  temperature assumption requires @xmath31@xmath91.51.8 , marginally consistent with @xmath31=2 ; indeed , these regions have been selected to be actively star  forming , so it is not surprising that their infrared emission is dominated by the warm dust component .",
    "dust emissivity values @xmath31@xmath342 have been derived for dust emitting regions in the magellanic clouds @xcite , assuming a single temperature for the modified blackbody ; however , two  temperature models with @xmath31=2 appear to produce equally good fits to the data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the multi  wavelength infrared / sub  mm data of ulirgs and slugs galaxies seem to indicate that better fits are obtained when multiple  temperature modified blackbody emission with emissivity having a power - law index @xmath31=2 @xcite . the presence of multiple temperature dust components is supported by the recent conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , who find evidence for dust self - absorption in the mid  infrared seds of lirgs , which then requires re - emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "these results provide ground for an `` onion  peel '' scenario , where different dust layers are heated at different temperatures .",
    "single  temperature fits yield values around 2025  k and @xmath936  k for the warm dust components of ngc 1512 ( and its sub  regions ) and ngc 1510 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with ngc 1510 being , on average , more actively star  forming than ngc 1512 ,",
    "when considering the star formation rate density ( table  1 ) , and also being less metal  rich , which leads to less ability of self  shielding for the dust @xcite .",
    "we also notice a higher temperature of the warmer dust in the center of ngc 1512 ( 25  k ) compared to that of the arm regions of the same galaxy ( 2021  k ) , implying a stronger radiation field in the galaxy center where more uv photons are reprocessed by dust grains .",
    "the combination of a long wavelength baseline for the dust emission ( thanks to the mm data ) and the physically  motivated models @xcite enables us to derive accurate dust masses for ngc 1512 and its subregions : typical 1  @xmath20 uncertainties are in the range 19%25% ( table  3 ) .",
    "less secure is the dust mass of the fainter ngc 1510 , with a factor @xmath93 uncertainty , due to its faint mm emission .",
    "we should stress that our quoted accuracy is within the context of the @xcite models .",
    "even with this uncertainty , we are in a position of deriving dust  to  gas ratios for the galaxy pair .",
    "the two interacting galaxies , located in the southern sky , do not have any co ( tracer of molecular gas ) observations ; therefore we will be limited to the derivation of @xmath7 ratio .",
    "interferometric vla observations exist for the pair @xcite , in addition to single  dish data from the parkes telescope ( as part of the hipass survey , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the latter data with low angular resolution to recover the diffuse emission in the galaxy pair which is missed by the interferometric data .",
    "the parkes data contain a total emission of 259@xmath117 jy km / s at 21  cm , and by comparing this figure with the total flux ( @xmath103@xmath20 ) contained in the vla map , we estimate that the interferometric observations miss @xmath952% of the total h i gas mass .",
    "we assume this `` diffuse '' component to be homogeneously distributed within the area occupied by the two galaxies ; this assumption is very simplistic , but we expect that its impact on the individual regions ( which are dominated by the clustered h i detected by the vla ) will not be large , except for the center of ngc 1512 where the h i flux is weak .",
    "we then measure the 21  cm emission within each of the five regions defined in table  2 from the vla image , include the correction for the `` diffuse '' gas derived above , and derive h i masses using the conventional formula @xmath36=",
    "2.36@xmath210@xmath5  @xmath37 , where the integrated intensity @xmath38 is in jy km / s and the distance in mpc .",
    "when enclosing the entire h i emission from the ngc 1512/ngc 1510 pair , we obtain @xmath7=0.0034@xmath10.0008 , consistent with the value 0.0028 found by @xcite .",
    "if only the h i emission inside our photometry aperture for ngc 1512 itself ( see description in the data analysis section ) is taken into account , the @xmath7 ratio becomes an order of magnitude higher ( 0.037 ) .",
    "significantly higher values are obtained for the northern ( @xmath7=0.089 ) and southern ( @xmath7=0.079 ) arm regions , and for the core ( @xmath7=0.13 ) .",
    "these values should be , however , considered upper limits to the actual dust  to  gas ratios , since we do not have @xmath39 measurements , and molecular gas is likely to be an important component in these three actively star  forming regions . based on spatially",
    " resolved co studies of other massive star  forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate the @xmath39 contribution to the gas content of the sub  galactic regions in ngc 1512 to be at least of the same order as the h i itself .",
    "using the expected proportionality between the dust  to  gas ratio and metallicity in galaxies , @xmath40@xmath180.010(o / h)/(o / h)@xmath41 , from @xcite , we can tentatively compare this formula with our derived dust and h i masses . using the metallicity value in table  1",
    ", we find for ngc 1512 , @xmath40=0.011 , which is lower than the @xmath7 value we determine the galaxy .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the absence of molecular gas data . for ngc 1510",
    ", we derive @xmath7=0.0027 , and , from its metallicity ( table  1 ) and @xcite s formula , an expected @xmath40=0.0042 .",
    "again , although the two numbers differ by about a factor of 2 , lack of molecular gas information hampers detailed comparisons .    while @xmath7 ratios for individual regions and/or the whole galaxies appear consistent or larger than what one would expect for @xmath40 as given by @xcite , the dust  to  gas ratio of the galaxy pair is lower , by about a factor of 3 , than what expected , based on the same formulae .",
    "this ` deficiency ' would be exacerbated by the presence of significant molecular gas in the system .",
    "we speculate this deficiency to be due to the presence of a large fraction of h i not associated with the star  forming disk(s ) and/or regions within the two galaxies .",
    "a solution to this issue will require both higher sensitivity h i maps and the availability of co maps to measure the contribution and distribution of the molecular gas .",
    "the combination of spitzer mid / far  infrared images with ground  based aste / aztec 1.1  mm data for the galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510 has enabled us to derive accurate ( @xmath919%25% uncertainty ) dust masses for the large spiral ngc 1512 and three of its subregions ( the center and the two spiral arms ) , and constrain the dust mass of the low ",
    "metallicity dwarf galaxy ngc 1510 to within a factor of 3 .",
    "the total dust mass of ngc 1512 is 2.4@xmath210@xmath3  m@xmath4 and it is about 150 times smaller in ngc 1510 , in agreement with the former being a large spiral galaxy and the latter a small compact dwarf galaxy .    in both galaxies ,",
    "when the seds are fitted with simplistic two - component modified planck functions , the majority of the dust mass is found to have a relatively cool temperature , @xmath91416  k , similar to what found for the nearby galaxy m31 .",
    "conversely , in the central region of ngc 1512 the cool and warm ( @xmath8@xmath925  k ) dust contribute close to equal mass , reflecting the larger specific sfr of the starbursting center relative to the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the two arm regions display properties that are intermediate between the central region and the whole galaxy in terms of ratio between the warm and cool dust mass , with values in the range 0.20.3 .",
    "the dust  to  gas ratio in ngc 1512 ( estimated using only h i , because of lack of co emission data for the pair ) is about 3 times below the expectation for a galaxy with a metallicity similar to the milky way , as already remarked in @xcite .",
    "the addition of @xmath39 to the gas census would only make the discrepancy worse .",
    "conversely , the subregions ( center and arms ) in the galaxy show high @xmath7 ratios , @xmath90.080.09 for the arms and @xmath90.13 in the center , thus about 20 to 30 times larger than the galaxy as a whole , and consistent with the lack of @xmath39 information .",
    "we speculate that much of the h i included in the @xmath7 ratio estimate of the galaxy as a whole is not related to the star  forming disk .",
