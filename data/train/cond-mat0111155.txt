    "quasicrystals ( qc)@xcite and their periodic approximants reveal unusual transport properties , e.g. , extremely low conductivity for alloys of metallic constituents@xcite , and it is generally believed that these properties are directly related to the long range but nonperiodic order . however , no coherent theoretical framework has been successfully established .",
    "for instance , previous calculations of the density of states ( dos ) revealed a set of peaks and gaps of small width ( @xmath2mev)@xcite but recent studies provide convincing arguments that these structures are numerical artifacts@xcite .",
    "most of the previous numerical studies of the conductivity were based on the landauer formula@xcite but only few studies were made in the framework of linear response theory@xcite .",
    "one  dimensional qcs , such as the fibonacci chain ( fc ) , have been studied in great detail by many researchers , because exact results and analytical treatments are possible .",
    "the most striking feature of this model is that quasiperiodicity induces long range correlations giving rise to an intermediate state of localisation .",
    "these so  called ` critical states ' are associated to singular continuous spectra of the hamiltonian@xcite , while all states are localized for randomly disordered systems in 1d .",
    "most progress in investigating 1d models has been made by methods based upon the trace  map and real  space decimation techniques . to the best of our knowledge",
    "nothing comparable has been worked out for the current  current correlation function which allows for a renormalization group approach of the frequency dependent conductivity .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 summarizes the physical model , in particular , the relation between the geometrical and the electronic structure which has been worked out in a preceding paper@xcite . in sec .",
    "3 , a suitable expression of the kubo conductivity is derived in terms of the known @xmath0 transfer matrices and additional @xmath1 matrices @xmath3 , which allow to set up a real  space renormalization scheme and its numerical implementation .",
