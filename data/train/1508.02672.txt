    "due to its low surface gravity , pluto has an atmosphere that extends to several radii ( @xmath2 ) and undergoes energy - limited escape .",
    "this means that a significant fraction of the solar euv radiation absorbed by the upper atmosphere powers mass loss @xcite . in this regard pluto , despite its large distance from the sun , is similar to many close - in extrasolar planets that undergo rapid , energy - limited escape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same escape regime may also have shaped the composition of the early atmospheres of venus , earth and mars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is likely to be important on many potentially habitable rocky exoplanets to be studied in the future ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this makes the observations of pluto s upper atmosphere by the new horizons / alice ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrograph especially interesting .",
    "the escape rate , that is constrained by the observed density and temperature profiles , is particularly important .",
    "it is the most pertinent test on the models , and a critical factor affecting the long - term evolution of the atmosphere .",
    "most of the recent models , however , focus on n@xmath1 , the dominant species .",
    "these models show that different escape mechanisms , hydrodynamic or jeans escape , that are controlled by the upper boundary conditions , lead to different density and temperature profiles that nevertheless correspond roughly to the same mass loss rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this means that , depending on the model , the same observed density profile can also be matched with different mass loss rates .",
    "furthermore , the models indicate that the density profiles in the upper atmosphere are sensitive to thermal structure and radiative balance in the lower atmosphere that are not directly related to the escape rate @xcite .",
    "these factors complicate the use of the n@xmath1 profile to constrain the escape rate .",
    "the alice spectrograph covers the wavelength range from 50 nm to 190 nm @xcite , including the ionization and dissociation continua of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 , as well as the n@xmath1 electronic bands , that probe the upper atmosphere above @xmath3  1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "thus the solar occultation measurements that will be obtained during the encounter provide simultaneous coverage of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 at radial distances of about 1.53 @xmath2 .",
    "the density profile of ch@xmath0 is controlled by both diffusion and the escape flux , and it can therefore provide further constraints on the escape rate . in this work we use a multi - species escape model , developed originally for extrasolar planets @xcite , to calculate the escape rates of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 from pluto at the conditions expected during the new horizons encounter .",
    "we note that early models of escape from pluto assumed that ch@xmath0 is the dominant species in the upper atmosphere , based on the argument that diffusive separation should lead ch@xmath0 to overtake n@xmath1 @xcite . in contrast , later work by @xcite , that included the effect of escape on ch@xmath0 and several other minor species in addition to diffusion , indicated that n@xmath1 is the dominant species at all altitudes .",
    "however , they also showed that the abundance of ch@xmath0 is potentially significant near the exobase .",
    "the purpose of this work is to revise the predictions for ch@xmath0 escape in light of the recent progress in models of atmospheric escape for pluto @xcite , and to study the sensitivity of the ch@xmath0 density profile to the escape rate , diffusion and surface mixing ratio .",
    "a detailed description of our escape model is given in @xcite .",
    "the model solves the time - dependent equations of continuity , momentum and energy in the vertical direction .",
    "we note that a time - dependent model passes smoothly through the critical point in transonic escape , although this is not important here because escape from pluto is subsonic .",
    "we solve common momentum and energy equations for the bulk flow , together with separate continuity equations for the different species i.e. , n@xmath1 , ch@xmath0 and co. the velocities of the these species are solved self - consistently by using the diffusion approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model is capable of including photochemistry in the upper atmosphere but this option is not used here because its influence on the density profiles should be negligible .    in order to calculate the solar euv heating rate in the upper atmosphere , we used a level 3 spectrum of the sun from the timed / see archive ( http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/see/ ) generated for 28 april , 2015 at a resolution of 1 nm . we calculated the absorption of radiation self - consistently in the model , and assumed euv heating efficiencies of 25 % and 50 % for n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this calculation differs from @xcite in that we used the full solar spectrum to calculate the euv heating rate instead of only 3 broad wavelength bins .",
    "we also used the parameterization given by @xcite to include infrared ( ir ) cooling from rotational lines of co. we did not include heating and cooling by the near - ir bands of ch@xmath0 that should be negligible in the upper atmosphere above our lower boundary at @xmath4  10@xmath5 bar .",
    "boundary conditions are of critical importance to the results . at the lower boundary we set the temperature to @xmath6  103.7 k and altitude to @xmath7  340.5 km , in agreement with the reference model of @xcite . for the composition",
    ", we varied the volume mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 by adopting surface values of 0.3 % , 0.44 % and 0.6 % for different simulations , based on the range derived from vlt / crires observations @xcite . in line with @xcite , we assumed a surface mixing ratio of 5  @xmath8  10@xmath9 for co in all of our simulations .",
    "the eddy mixing rate is currently unknown , and we adopted values of 10 , 100 , and 1000 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 for the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "the molecular diffusion coefficients were taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "our reference model assumes a ch@xmath0 surface mixing ratio of 0.44 % and @xmath13  100 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 .",
    "the ch@xmath0-n@xmath1 diffusion coefficient in the reference model varies from 34 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 at the lower boundary to 8.5  @xmath8  10@xmath14 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 at the exobase .",
    "we can use the above information to verify that the ch@xmath0 profile is not significantly affected by photochemistry .",
    "the photolysis of ch@xmath0 is dominated by the solar lyman @xmath15 photon flux , which is 3.8  @xmath8  10@xmath16 m@xmath17  s@xmath11 at 32.9 au based on the timed / see spectrum .",
    "the ch@xmath0 cross section at lyman @xmath15 is 1.85  @xmath8  10@xmath18 m@xmath10 and the subsolar optical depth based on our model reaches unity near 1.4 @xmath2 .",
    "the subsolar ( global minimum ) photolysis timescale at 1.4 @xmath2 is therefore 3.9  @xmath8  10@xmath19 s. the ch@xmath0n@xmath1 diffusion coefficient at that level is @xmath20  1.7  @xmath8  10@xmath10 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 and the scale height is 92 km .",
    "thus the subsolar photolysis timescale is longer than the diffusion timescale of @xmath21  5  @xmath8  10@xmath14 s. this difference increases rapidly with altitude and near the effective heating peak of about 1.8 @xmath2 ( see section  [ subsc : mloss ] ) the photolysis timescale is 50 times longer than the diffusion timescale .    at the upper boundary",
    ", we used the modified jeans ( type - i ) boundary conditions with an enhancement factor of 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the upper boundary is placed at the exobase ( where the knudsen number @xmath22  1 ) , the altitude of which is automatically adjusted by our model while the simulations approach steady state .",
    "we used the same boundary condition for the temperature gradient as @xcite .",
    "their model , however , did not consider co and ch@xmath0 separately whereas our model requires additional boundary conditions for the velocities and partial pressure gradients of the individual species .",
    "we set the velocities of the different species at the exobase to the jeans effusion velocity : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the escape parameter for a species with mass @xmath25 and @xmath26  1.5 .",
    "the pressure gradient for species @xmath27 at the upper boundary can then be derived from the diffusion equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath31 is the volume mixing ratio and @xmath32 is the mutual diffusion coefficient for species @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note that eddy diffusion does not need to be included in the upper boundary conditions because @xmath34 at the exobase .",
    "the ch@xmath0 abundance profile in pluto s atmosphere is controlled primarily by escape , with limited sensitivity to our range of surface mixing ratios or @xmath12 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : ch4profs ] that shows the ch@xmath0 profiles for 5 different simulations .",
    "the solid lines show results for models with @xmath13  101000 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 and a surface mixing ratio of 0.44 % , including the reference model , while the dashed and dashed - triple - dotted lines show models with @xmath13  100 m@xmath10  s@xmath11 and ch@xmath0 surface mixing ratios of 0.3 % and 0.6 % , respectively .",
    "the global escape rate in these models , which increases with the surface mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 , is 1.82.3  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 .",
    "this is the sum of the escape rates of the individual species ( hereafter , the total escape rate ) . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted and dash - dotted lines show the zero escape and reduced escape ch@xmath0 profiles , respectively , based on the t - p profile in the reference model .",
    "the reduced total escape rate here is 2.9  @xmath8  10@xmath36 s@xmath11 , based on a reduced jeans enhancement factor of @xmath26  0.15 .    in the absence of escape ch@xmath0",
    "would become the dominant species in the reference model around @xmath37  4.4 @xmath2 i.e. , well below the exobase , which is located at @xmath37  56 @xmath2 .",
    "with escape included , however , the ch@xmath0 mixing ratio is less than 1 % at all altitudes . near @xmath37  3 @xmath2 where",
    "solar occultations in the euv become sensitive to absorption by ch@xmath0 ( see section  [ subsc : obs ] ) , the mixing ratio in the reference model is only 0.46 % whereas in the zero escape case it is almost 50 times larger at 21.4 % .",
    "an escape rate of about 2  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 therefore leads to a nearly constant mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 below @xmath37  3 @xmath2 .",
    "the strong dependence of the ch@xmath0 mixing ratios on escape means that observations of the ch@xmath0 profile provide a means to constrain the escape rate and thus the first opportunity to partially validate a hydrodynamic escape model for a planetary atmosphere .",
    "the escape rate predicted by the current models is near the saturation value i.e. , the value that leads to a nearly constant mixing ratio , which is close to the surface mixing ratio , below 3 @xmath2 .",
    "as shown by figure  [ fig : ch4profs ] , a lower total escape rate of 2.9  @xmath8  10@xmath36 s@xmath11 with the reference model t - p profile leads to a higher ch@xmath0 mixing ratio of 1.5 % at @xmath37  3 @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the ch@xmath0 profiles in figure  [ fig : ch4profs ] are practically independent of @xmath12 , which further enhances their potential to constrain the escape rate .",
    "we note that our results differ from @xcite who also studied the diffusion and escape of ch@xmath0 on pluto .",
    "their model , which included an n@xmath1 escape rate of 2.6  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 , predicted that diffusive separation of ch@xmath0 takes place near @xmath37  2300 km , and that the mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 is about 19 % at @xmath37  3500 km . in our models",
    "the mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 at @xmath37  3500 km varies between 0.32 % and 0.61 % .",
    "the differences between our model and the earlier work are difficult to identify exactly .",
    "the exobase , however , was typically at a lower altitude in the model of @xcite , and their temperatures were generally cooler .",
    "our temperatures are significantly warmer due to the upper boundary condition based on the jeans energy flux .",
    "the temperature profiles based on our models are shown by figure  [ fig : temps ] .",
    "the differences in the predicted temperatures are within 5 k. the peak temperature increases with the abundance of ch@xmath0 , while the temperature near the exobase decreases slightly as the peak temperature increases .",
    "this is caused by more efficient absorption of lyman @xmath15 radiation by ch@xmath0 , which leads to both higher peak temperatures and a slightly higher escape rate . as a result , adiabatic cooling near",
    "the exobase is also more efficient , leading to a slightly lower temperature near the exobase . due to the nearly constant mixing ratio of less than 1 % for ch@xmath0 in the model ,",
    "however , the inclusion of diffusion does not significantly affect the results of @xcite who assumed that ch@xmath0 is uniformly mixed with the surface value of 0.44 % .",
    "our temperature profiles do differ slightly from their predictions , but this is mostly due to the co cooling parameterization in our work that leads to lower peak temperatures .",
    "our reference model predicts a total escape rate of 2.1  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 .",
    "this value is essentially identical to the previous estimates of the escape rate from pluto s atmosphere .",
    "we find that n@xmath1 and co escape from the exobase with an outflow velocity of 1.75 m  s@xmath11 , while the ch@xmath0 outflow velocity is much higher , about 18 m  s@xmath11 . due to the relatively low abundance of ch@xmath0 , however , the effective bulk outflow velocity i.e. , @xmath38 , is still only 1.82 m  s@xmath11",
    ". the predicted escape rate of ch@xmath0 in our models is 12  @xmath8  10@xmath36 s@xmath11 , or about 510 % of the n@xmath1 escape rate .",
    "these values are an order of magnitude lower than the diffusion limit of 2  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "thus our reference model agrees with recent work in that escape from pluto is strongly subsonic , and that the escape of n@xmath1 dominates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models also show that mass loss from pluto is energy - limited .",
    "this statement needs to be qualified , because of the efficiency factors that affect this conclusion .",
    "the energy limited mass loss rate based on globally averaged solar flux is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the integrated solar flux , in this case at wavelengths of 1145 nm , @xmath41 is the mass loss efficiency , @xmath42 is the heating efficiency , @xmath43 is the effective radius of the heating peak and @xmath44 is the gravitational potential difference that the escaping particles have to overcome .    at the distance of 32.9",
    "au , the integrated solar flux is @xmath45  1.18  @xmath8  10@xmath46 w  m@xmath17 , based on the timed / see spectrum . the global , effective heat flux in our reference model is @xmath47  3.01  @xmath8  10@xmath48 w  m@xmath17 , which is based on the net heating rate that includes co cooling , and @xmath49  1.78 @xmath2 .",
    "thus the heating efficiency is @xmath50  0.26 , and the energy - limited mass loss rate based on this efficiency would be 103 kg  s@xmath11 .",
    "the mass loss rate predicted by the reference model , on the other hand , is 96 kg  s@xmath11 , implying that the mass loss efficiency is @xmath51  0.93 .",
    "this means that , at least according to the models , escape from pluto is energy - limited i.e. , @xmath52  1 , in analogy to many close - in extrasolar giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and in contrast to the present planetary atmospheres in the solar system .",
    "boundary conditions for escape models have been discussed extensively in recent literature on pluto , but so far this discussion has received only cursory attention elsewhere .",
    "for example , many of the existing time - dependent exoplanet models rely on the so - called outflow boundary conditions i.e. , extrapolation of the density , temperature and velocity with a constant slope at the upper boundary ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these boundary conditions lead to unphysical outcomes on pluto , which has an exobase well below the altitude of the implied sonic point . in theory",
    ", the outflow boundary conditions may be valid above the sonic point , although this assertion probably deserves further attention in future studies .",
    "other exoplanet models have imposed jeans or modified jeans outflow velocities at the upper boundary with extrapolated temperatures , either with a zero gradient or a constant slope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach appears to be valid only if the atmosphere is rendered isothermal by conduction at the exobase , in which case the constant slope also reduces to the isothermal boundary condition and produces acceptable results . on pluto ,",
    "extrapolating the temperature with a constant slope leads to an almost adiabatic decrease in temperature with altitude , and a much cooler exobase . as a result , the conductive heat flux becomes larger than the jeans energy flux .",
    "zero gradient , on the other hand , leads to an overestimated temperature near the exobase . in general",
    ", the validity of the boundary conditions in the present models , and thus the escape solution , can be tested by matching the models with both the n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 density profiles that are , at least in theory , retrievable from the euv solar occultations .",
    "the model calculations show that the ch@xmath0 profile can be used as an indicator of the escape rate ; however , it is important to have coincident measurements of n@xmath1 because this enables calculation of the ch@xmath0 mixing ratio and the atmospheric temperature .",
    "we note that stellar and solar occultations observed by the cassini / uvis instrument in its euv channel have been used to retrieve coincident density profiles of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 in titan s upper atmosphere for the same range of slant column densities that is relevant for escape models on pluto .",
    "in particular , @xcite used the 58.4 nm and 63 nm solar emission lines in the ionization continuum of n@xmath1 , together with a wavelength bin around 108.5 nm in the ionization continuum of ch@xmath0 , to retrieve these density profiles from a solar occultation .",
    "in addition , @xcite used euv stellar occultations at 91.1110 nm , probing the n@xmath1 electronic band system , for the same purpose .",
    "for example , we used our models to calculate predicted transmission for pluto in the 108.5 nm bin , which includes a group of solar n ii and he ii emission lines @xcite . in this region absorption",
    "is by ch@xmath0 and the cross section is roughly constant with wavelength @xcite , allowing for a simple transmission calculation instead of a more complex forward model .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lcs ] , which indicates that the zero escape case is clearly distinguishable from our reference model .",
    "the difference in transmission between the reference model and the reduced escape model is less pronounced , peaking at about 0.09 around 1.9 @xmath2 where transmission is about 0.7 .",
    "this difference is detectable with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 8 or higher .",
    "we also used our reference model to calculate transmission in the 63 nm wavelength bin , which includes the solar o v line that is absorbed predominantly by n@xmath1 , with a small contribution from ch@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting light curve is limited to altitudes above 2.5 @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) . at lower altitudes the n@xmath1 electronic band system ( 80100 nm )",
    "can be used to retrieve the n@xmath1 profile . to illustrate this ,",
    "we calculated transmission at 8990.5 nm in the solar lyman continuum , in order to avoid uncertainties associated with the width of the solar emission lines . some of these lines are absorbed by the n@xmath1 bands while absorption by ch@xmath0 features strongly between the bands . a high resolution forward model is therefore required to calculate transmission , even when instrument broadening is significant . in our model we used a sumer spectrum of the sun @xcite and a high resolution n@xmath1 band cross section @xcite . in order to include the point spread function ( psf ) for alice , we used a gaussian with a fwhm of 0.4 nm @xcite .",
    "the resulting occultation light curves in figure  [ fig : lcs ] show that ch@xmath0 can be measured from 1.6 @xmath2 to 24 @xmath2 and n@xmath1 can be measured from 1.8 @xmath2 to 4 @xmath2 , assuming that densities can be retrieved for transmissions between 0.1 and 0.9 .",
    "the precise altitude range will , of course , depend on the noise characteristics of the data set .",
    "we adapted a multi - species model of hydrodynamic escape to calculate the escape rates of n@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 from pluto , and to quantify the effect of escape on the ch@xmath0 profile .",
    "the ch@xmath0 profile plays a critical role in the heating and photochemistry of the upper atmosphere , and under diffusive separation it should overtake n@xmath1 as the dominant species below the exobase . as we showed , it can also be used to constrain the escape rate .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to test models of hydrodynamic escape in an actual atmosphere .",
    "the total escape rate predicted by our reference model is 2.1  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 , in agreement with previous models . in terms of energy - limited escape",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath5324 % of the incident solar uv flux at 1145 nm with an effective heating peak around 1.78 @xmath2 .",
    "the ch@xmath0 escape rate in the model is about 510 % of the n@xmath1 escape rate .",
    "we find that the mixing ratio of ch@xmath0 in the upper atmosphere depends strongly on the escape rate and is almost independent of @xmath12",
    ". the total escape rate of 2.1  @xmath8  10@xmath35 s@xmath11 leads to a nearly constant mixing ratio that is close to the surface value below @xmath37  3 @xmath2 whereas lower escape rates lead to substantially higher mixing ratios .",
    "given an independent measurement of the surface mixing ratio , the ch@xmath0 and n@xmath1 profiles at @xmath54  1.83 @xmath2 that are retrievable from euv occultations can therefore constrain the escape rate .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions that have contributed to improve this paper .",
    "no data was used in producing this manuscript .",
    "we also thank m. j. harris for useful correspondence and support with the escape model .",
