    "advanced interferometric gravitational wave detectors , such as advanced virgo  @xcite , advanced ligo  @xcite , or geo - hf  @xcite are making first detections or are about to start observations .",
    "all these detectors are using a special case of homodyne detection called dc readout  @xcite to extract the differential arm length signal from the light at the interferometer output , that is the carrier light .",
    "a crucial element in the dc readout detection scheme is an output mode cleaner ( omc ) that removes light not containing the gravitational wave signal : high order modes caused by interferometer mirror defects and radio - frequency side bands used for the control of auxiliary degrees of freedom .",
    "the omc is a non - degenerate optical cavity that transmits only the gaussian beam at the carrier frequency .",
    "one drawback of this scheme is that any length noise of the omc cavity is imprinted on the transmitted light if the cavity length is not perfectly adjusted to the carrier frequency .",
    "the coupling factor is proportional to the root - mean - square of the difference between light carrier frequency and cavity resonant frequency .",
    "a very low cavity length noise of a few at has been obtained for rigid cavities  @xcite , however these have no means to tune the cavity length to follow the light frequency at the output of the interferometer . although a scheme has been proposed to remove the need for cavity length actuator @xcite , all current detectors have actuators on the omc length that may introduce additional length noise .    for advanced ligo and geo - hf",
    "the omc is a 4-mirror bow - tie cavity with one of the mirrors directly mounted on a piezo - electric actuator ( pzt )  @xcite , an upper limit of on the cavity length noise introduced by this pzt has been measured  @xcite .",
    "advanced virgo chose an alternative , more compact design with a single piece of fused silica forming a 4 surface bow - tie cavity  @xcite , based on previous experience from virgo  @xcite .",
    "the cavity optical length can be controlled with two actuators , a peltier cell that thermally changes the refractive index in the cavity and hence the optical length , and a pzt pressing the omc transversely and allowing a fast control of the refractive index but with a low dynamic range .",
    "this choice has the advantage of reducing noise from mechanical vibration and from the pzt , but has the drawback of light circulating in the substrate instead of vacuum , which among other things introduces additional thermal noise  @xcite . in order to obtain sufficient light filtering without introducing high thermal noise and large scattered light losses ,",
    "two monolithic cavities are placed in series instead of a single cavity with high finesse .    in this paper",
    "we present an upper limit on the advanced virgo omc length noise and the achieved precision of the omc length control in a table top measurement . by combining these two measurements",
    "we derive the expected contribution of the omc length noise to the advanced virgo measurement noise . in section",
    "[ sec : omc ] we discuss in detail the expected thermal length noise of the omc and its coupling to the gravitational wave measurement , then in section  [ sec : setup ] we describe the test measurement setup .",
    "section  [ sec : lengthnoise ] presents the length noise upper limit and section  [ sec : lockprecision ] the length control precision .",
    "the optimization of parameters for the advanced virgo omc led to a design composed of two monolithic fused silica cavities in series  @xcite , which allows good radio frequency filtering with low finesse and short cavities .",
    "each omc cavity is a single piece of fused silica with an elongated hexagon shape .",
    "the cavity has an effective length @xmath0 ( half of the round - trip length ) which corresponds to an optical path length @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fused silica refractive index .",
    "the cavity finesse was measured to be @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "one of the cavity surfaces is curved , with a radius of , and the beam resonating in the cavity has a waist @xmath4 located at the cavity input surface .    the cavity couples the fluctuations in optical path length @xmath5 to power fluctuations @xmath6 of the transmitted light @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the laser wavelength . in practice the optical path fluctuations",
    "are dominated by low frequency fluctuations , hence we decompose the cavity length fluctuations into a large dynamic , low frequency ( below ) component with root - mean - square ( rms ) @xmath9 and a small component @xmath10 in the sensing band of advanced virgo (  ) @xmath11 using this decomposition , can be approximated above by @xmath12    the corresponding noise on the gravitational wave signal is directly given by the power fluctuations in transmission of the omc divided by interferometer response transfer function @xmath13 .",
    "hence the omc length noise coupling into the gravitational wave signal is @xmath14 where the additional factor @xmath15 comes from adding in quadrature the length noise of the two omc cavities .",
    ".fused silica parameters for thermo - refractive noise calculation [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     statistical fluctuations of temperature cause fluctuation in the cavity length .",
    "compared to a 4 mirror cavity design , a monolithic cavity has additional thermal fluctuations from the medium in which light circulates .",
    "given that the thermal expansion coefficient of fused silica @xmath16 is small compared to the changes of the refractive index as a function of temperature @xmath17 , the dominant thermal length noise is thermo - refractive noise .",
    "there is also a contribution from brownian noise and from all coatings thermal noises , but these are also negligible compared to thermo - refractive noise .    thermo - refractive noise has been computed as a function of frequency @xmath18 for an infinite plane of thickness @xmath19 in appendix e of @xcite and can be rewritten as @xmath20^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath22 is the thermal path length and the values of the different parameters for fused silica are given in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "the integral term equates to 1 in the adiabatic limit where @xmath23 . at low frequencies where @xmath24 , the integral term is @xmath25 , hence the thermo - refractive noise remains bounded at low frequency .",
    "the same result has been obtained more recently for a finite cavity of cylindrical geometry @xcite , which restrains its validity to the range where @xmath26 is much larger than the wavelength and much smaller than the transverse size of the cavity ( ) .",
    "this corresponds to a valid frequency range of  , which covers well the frequency range of interest here .",
    "the principle of these computations has been confirmed by measuring thermo - refractive noise in a very different geometry of whispering - gallery mode of microspheres  @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : lengthnoise ] we measure that the cavity length noise at is not larger than the one predicted by .",
    "the omc cavity length fluctuations are measured using a dedicated optical test setup .",
    "the setup is located on a passively isolated optical bench , enclosed in aluminium and plexiglas covers placed on a tubular structure to prevent beam jitter from the clean room air flow .",
    "a schematic of the optical layout is shown on figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the light from a mephisto laser  @xcite at is picked - off to a photo - diode ( pd ) to measure the laser intensity noise ; the main part ( 90% ) of the beam is matched with a telescope to two cavities set in parallel .",
    "this is different from the advanced virgo case where the two cavities are placed in series , and allows a simple measurement where light seen by one cavity is not directly affected by the other . for each cavity",
    "two pds measure the transmitted power , which is between and depending on the pd .    to obtain an error signal for the cavity length ,",
    "a dithering sine - wave at a dozen khz is applied to each cavity by a pzt .",
    "the cavity length error point is the pd signal demodulated at the dither frequency .",
    "this signal is limited by the laser intensity noise at the dither frequency . with the active power stabilization loop enabled ( `` noise eater ''  @xcite ) ,",
    "the laser intensity noise at a dozen khz has a relative intensity @xmath27 .",
    "this laser intensity is measured by a pick - off pd and subtracted before demodulation .",
    "the length error point is calibrated by scanning linearly the laser frequency over several cavity free spectral ranges , each free spectral range corresponding to a cavity length change of @xmath28 , as can be seen from .",
    "the measurement has an absolute statistical error of 23% and the systematic error from using the cavity length as a reference is less than 1% .",
    "consequently the relative calibration is adjusted by several percent to obtain a good cancellation of common frequency noise between the two cavities .",
    "this cancellation is described in section  [ sec : lengthnoise ] .",
    "in our measurement the laser frequency noise is dominant .",
    "hence we lock the laser onto the length of omc1 with a bandwidth of @xmath29 to reduce the frequency noise , and leave the omc1 cavity length free .",
    "the omc2 length is locked onto the laser frequency using peltier cells and the pzt actuator with a loop unity gain frequency around @xmath30 .",
    "laser frequency noise @xmath31 couples to transmitted light fluctuation @xmath6 in the same way as cavity length noise as shown in .",
    "the spectra of the two cavities length error points are shown on figure  [ fig : lengthnoise ] and are dominated by laser frequency noise .",
    "this frequency noise is equivalent to cavity length noise @xmath32 using the relation @xmath33 with @xmath34 the light frequency . with this notation and dismissing other noise contributions",
    "the cavity calibrated error point can be written as @xmath35 hence the difference between the two cavities @xmath36 should be a good measure of the differential length , free of the common laser frequency noise . this is a true representation of the cavity differential length above as the omc1 length is free and the omc2 length control loop has a gain well below 1 .",
    "however , some of the laser frequency noise is re - injected by pzt feedback of the omc2 length control , as the loop gain at 10-@xmath37 is @xmath38 and not zero .",
    "this means that in addition to omc2 free cavity length noise there is a loop feedback contribution @xmath39 .",
    "the latter can be easily subtracted as the feedback voltage is known and the cavity has a flat response of @xmath40 at these frequencies , hence we define the loop corrected differential length as @xmath41    these noise curves are shown on figure  [ fig : lengthnoise ] along with the pd electronic and photon shot - noise that are one order of magnitude smaller . for comparison the thermo - refractive noise of the two cavities from [ eq : thermorefractive ] added in quadrature is also shown .",
    "the measured cavity differential length shows many lines due to mechanical resonances on the optical bench coupling through the omc pzt clamping .",
    "in particular the lines at @xmath42 and @xmath43 come from the tubular posts that hold plexiglas covers to prevent air - flow , and their coupling depends on the torque applied to the pzt clamping .",
    "below @xmath44 there are large fluctuations that are not understood . nonetheless in the 10-@xmath45 band",
    "the measured noise is within 10% of the thermo - refractive prediction , and is an upper - limit that no length noise is larger than this prediction .",
    "due to higher gain laser frequency control .",
    "below that frequency the out - of - loop length rms is .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the cavity length fluctuations couple to the gravitational wave detector sensitivity through [ eq : hnoise ] .",
    "a critical parameter is the lock precision @xmath46 . in section  [ sec : lengthnoise ]",
    "we used a low gain on the omc2 cavity length control to limit re - injecting frequency noise with the loop and to simplify the result interpretation . to improve the lock precision ,",
    "the omc is operated with a factor 10 higher loop gain and a unity gain at a few hz . as in the previous section",
    "the loop feedback is dominated by the peltier cells temperature feedback below and by the pzt feedback above this cross - over frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : lockprecision ] shows the omc2 error point spectrum for a high gain loop using the in - loop and out - of - loop pd .",
    "this achieves @xmath47 for the out - of - loop signal , over 3 times lower than the design requirement  @xcite .    in advanced virgo",
    "the precision of the laser lock onto the reference cavity is @xmath48  rms  @xcite , which through [ eq : freqlength ] is equivalent to @xmath49 , that is a laser frequency control orders of magnitude better that the one achieved here .",
    "therefore in the real case the laser frequency should not be dominant as in the test setup presented here , and the omc lock precision should be easily reproduced even with a lower control loop gain .    using [ eq : hnoise ] we combine the achieved lock precision @xmath46 and the measured upper limit on cavity noise @xmath10 shown in figure  [ fig : lengthnoise ] to obtain the expected contribution of omc length noise to the advanced virgo measurement noise shown on figure  [ fig : noiseprojection ] .",
    "below this expected noise is at least 10 times smaller than the advanced virgo design sensitivity  @xcite or the updated sensitivity expectation using more accurate suspension thermal noise models  @xcite . above the measured omc length noise upper limit",
    "is dominated by mechanical resonance of the measurement setup , nonetheless it remains below the design sensitivity curve .",
    "note that in the initial broadband configurations  @xcite the constraints on the omc length noise are @xmath50 weaker than in the configuration optimized for binary neutron star detection .",
    "indeed , without signal recycling or with signal recycling tuned the optical gain at is about an order of magnitude higher , hence the omc length noise coupling in these cases is 10 times smaller at low frequency than presented here .     onto the advanced virgo design noise curve assuming a lock precision of and a detuned signal recycling configuration .",
    "the original design and updated design advanced virgo noise curves are shown . ,",
    "we have measured an upper limit on the advanced virgo omc cavity length noise . in the 10- band",
    "this upper limit is consistent with the thermo - refractive noise prediction , confirming that there is no other significant length noise in this cavity design .",
    "we achieved a lock precision of @xmath47 , which is a factor 17 better than obtained previously for the virgo omc  @xcite . combining these two results",
    "we have shown that the omc length noise contribution to the advanced virgo measurement should be at least a factor 10 below other expected noise sources in the 10- band , which is most challenging for technical noises .",
    "this gives confidence that the omc noise should not be a limiting factor in the forthcoming advanced virgo observations .",
    "the achieved gap between the expected omc noise contribution and advanced virgo noise opens the prospects of further parameter optimization depending on the issues encountered during the first advanced virgo operations .",
    "for example the radio - frequency side - band filtering could be improved by an order of magnitude by increasing the omc finesse by a factor 2 .",
    "this would increase the thermo - refractive noise by a factor 4 but it would still remain a factor 10 below other expected noises .",
    "we would like to thank our advanced virgo collaborators for numerous discussions that lead to the design and optimization of the omc cavities discussed here ."
