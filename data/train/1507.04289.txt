    "unconventional superconductivity and other novel electronic behaviors in transition metal oxides continue to drive the study of strong electron correlations . doping which breaks translational invariance",
    "is generally required to obtain these novel behaviors , raising the question of how disorder affects strongly correlated systems . meanwhile , since the seminal work of anderson in 1958,@xcite localization of single - particle states by disorder has been the subject of intense study in a wide range of systems.@xcite experiments have suggested that electron - electron interactions might drive a delocalization transition,@xcite and there has been recent rapid progress in addressing the question of how interactions affect localized systems.@xcite in this paper we ask how electron - electron interactions affect several novel features recently pointed out in non - interacting disordered systems.@xcite after anderson first predicted localization , significant effort went toward establishing whether or not any feature in the density of states was associated with localization .",
    "edwards and thouless@xcite showed that the density of states is analytic in a wide energy range around the middle of the band for all continuous distributions , and wegner@xcite showed that the density of states neither vanishes nor diverges anywhere inside the band for gaussian distributed disorder .",
    "it therefore came as a surprise when johri and bhatt@xcite uncovered the existence of a non - analyticity in the density of states of systems with bounded disorder .",
    "their result does not contradict earlier work .",
    "rather , the non - analyticity they found occurs outside the energy range addressed by edwards and thouless .    beyond the novelty of this singularity , johri and bhatt showed that a corresponding singularity exists in the inverse participation ratio , a measure of localization , and demonstrated that these singularities mark the boundary of a region at the edge of the band dominated by resonant states , also known as lifshitz states .",
    "moreover , while this behavior persists in large systems and in two and three dimensions,@xcite johri and bhatt demonstrated that the key features can be seen and understood analytically in the simple case of an ensemble of two - site systems.@xcite    here we consider an ensemble of two - site anderson - hubbard systems and calculate both the density of states and a generalized form of the inverse participation ratio applicable to interacting systems .",
    "[ main ] summarizes our key results .",
    "the presence of local interactions results in a richer energy dependence of both quantities .",
    "in particular , the minimum in the inverse participation ratio no longer occurs at the band edge but instead moves closer to the fermi level .",
    "we present below an exploration of how these changes arise , highlighting two distinct types of resonance which can occur in interacting systems and their role in our results .",
    "the anderson - hubbard model is a tight - binding hamiltonian which includes nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 , on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 , and site potentials chosen from a uniform distribution of width @xmath2 .",

    "the width of the contribution from singly occupied sites grows with @xmath0 , matching that from empty and doubly occupied sites at @xmath31 and exceeding it at @xmath32 .    with hopping , the occupancy of each site is no longer integer , and there is an increase both in the number of distinct energies at which transitions can occur and in the range of weights associated with these transitions .",

    "therefore the overall magnitude of the dos at a given energy is simply proportional to the length of the constant energy curve at that energy . in the interacting case ,",
    "there is variation in the magnitudes of the dos contributions from different transitions , meaning that the line length alone is not the sole determinant of the dos magnitude at each energy .",
    "however , the main qualitative features of the dos contribution from each transition are still reflected in the changes in line length .",
    "consider , for example , the 1:2a transition .",
    "the constant energy curve has the same shape as the boundary between the 2-particle and the 1-particle ground state regions . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the constant energy curve coincides with this boundary , and the transition makes its maximum contribution to the dos .",
    "as the energy is increased , the constant energy curve moves to the right declining in length roughly linearly with energy . in this way",
    "the origin of the energy dependence of the dos contributions of each transition can be seen , and from these the structure of the dos as a whole .",

    "alternatively , the system at @xmath47 has a gipr of 0.5 for this transition . in this case , the ldos associate with the transition is roughly equal on the two sites , and the transition is as extended as it can be in a two - site system .",

    "[ table ] shows gipr values for each transition for a selection of systems at different values of @xmath48 along the constant energy curve shown in column 3 .",
    "the gipr values are independent of @xmath49 . for most transitions",
    "the gipr value increases as @xmath48 increases .",
    "for example , 2:3a transitions have gipr values of 0.5 at @xmath47 and these values increase rapidly to 1 at higher values of @xmath48 .",
    "the 2:3b transition is particularly interesting : there are two minima in the gipr , one at @xmath47 and one at @xmath50 .",
    "these two values represent the two distinct types of resonance which can occur in a strongly correlated system .",
    "the @xmath47 resonance is the one present in non - interacting systems : the potentials on the two sites are the same .",
    "the @xmath51 resonance is unique to strongly correlated systems : here the potential on one site is greater by @xmath0 than the potential on the other site .    from column 4 of fig .",
    "[ table ] it is clear that the transitions contributing to the dos at any given energy may have a wide range of gipr values , both because of contributions at the same energy from different transitions and because of variation in the gipr within a single transition . to obtain a single value at each energy we average over all the contributions . in the non - interacting case studied by johri & bhatt@xcite",
    ", the magnitude of the dos contribution from each transition is the same , so the ipr values can be directly averaged . in the interacting case we study here ,",

    "then , after reaching a sharp maximum there is an abrupt drop in the ipr at the edges of the band .",
    "this drop has been shown@xcite to come specifically from systems with extreme @xmath49 values but @xmath48 near zero .",
    "the states in these systems have been referred to as resonant or lifshitz states .    when @xmath0 is nonzero , the gipr , like the dos , has much more structure .",
    "one pattern is an overall lowering of the gipr over most of the width of the band as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this is consistent with weak interactions providing screening which reduces localization .",
    "a second pattern is the persistence of region of sharply suppressed localization . in",
    "particular this region moves towards the band center as @xmath0 increases .",
    "what causes this abrupt drop ?",
    "changes in the gipr can occur at frequencies at which a particular transition starts or stops making dos contributions or due to variations in the gipr value within a specific transition .",
    "the latter effect is generally smoother and smaller in magnitude .",
    "the sharp drops in gipr which move toward the center of the band with increasing @xmath0 are due to equal - site - potential resonances , as in the noninteracting case .",
    "there do not appear to be such dramatic features associated specifically with the @xmath51 resonances unique to strongly correlated systems .",
    "in non - interacting systems , sharp peaks in the dos were found to coincide with peaks in the ipr at the edge of an energy range dominated by resonant states .",
    "focusing on ensembles of two - site systems at half filling , we find that in interacting systems the same pattern persists . with available transitions dependent on the ground state of the system , both the dos and the gipr have more structure than in the non - interacting case .",
    "nonetheless , sharp peaks in the dos continue to be associated with abrupt drops in the gipr .    in non - interacting systems",
    "the decline in the ipr comes from resonant states in systems in which the potentials on both sites are similar . in strongly interacting systems",
    ", a distinction can be drawn between this matching of site potentials and a strongly - correlated resonance in which the site potentials differ by the onsite interaction strength @xmath0 . both types of resonance can be seen in the gipr spectra of individual systems . however , no feature in the ensemble average results can be uniquely associated with the strongly - correlated resonance .",
    "our results show a reduction of localization as interactions are turned on .",
    "when the interaction strength becomes greater than the disorder and a mott gap opens , the trend reverses , consistent with other work on interactions in disordered systems.@xcite it is of particular interest that interactions shift the regions of suppressed localization toward the fermi level , making this behavior more accessible to experiments .",
    "both the dos peaks and the gipr dips should be observable in quantum dot systems.@xcite there has been recent rapid progress in understanding the phenomenon of many - body localization , focusing mostly on spin systems .",
    "it can be shown that the hamiltonian of any system with a hilbert space of dimension @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of spinors.@xcite in this spinor picture , eigenstates differ in the flipping of individual spinors .",
    "therefore , the gipr presented here , which is a measure of the localization of transitions between many - body eigenstates , is providing information on the localization of these spinors . moving away from half filling and exploring larger systems will be important directions for further study .",
