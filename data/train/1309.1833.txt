    "galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) are high energy particles that pass through the interstellar space in our milky way galaxy .",
    "the most abundant components of gcrs are protons and @xmath0 particles .",
    "these energetic particles can interact with the matters both in the interstellar space and interplanetary space .",
    "the former can be used to investigate the origin and evolution of gcr itself@xcite , and the latter provide us an useful tool to investigate the cosmic ray exposure history of extraterrestrial bodies such as the planets and the meteorites@xcite . among these bodies",
    "the moon is an unique one in our solar system . due to the atmosphere",
    "free and old surface , the moon has recorded rich information about the solar system evolution and variations of the galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) in the past several billion years .",
    "gcrs can bombard directly the solid surface of the moon .",
    "the interactions of gcrs ( primary particles ) and the matters of the lunar surface can produce many protons , neutrons and mesons ( secondary particles ) and some nuclei that can not be synthesized by thermonuclear reactions .",
    "these nuclei are called cosmogenic nuclei .",
    "the materials returned by apollo and luna missions has provided good opportunities to study the cosmogenic nuclei with very high accuracy .",
    "it can be expected that the lunar samples returned by chinese lunar exploration program in the near future will promote enormously the development of lunar and planetary science including the investigation of cosmogenic nuclei . to provide reliable method to interpret the measured data in the near future , it is time to investigate this subject beforehand from theoretical points of view .    in principle ,",
    "if both the concentration and production rate of a stable cosmogenic nuclei are known , one can calculate the cosmic - ray exposure ( cre ) age of that material .",
    "the concentration of nuclei can be measured accurately in laboratory by accelerator mass spectrometer ( ams ) , but the calculation of the absolute production rate is much more difficult in general speaking .",
    "fortunately , there is an important exception .",
    "if the cre age is much longer than the half - life of a given radioactive cosmogenic nucleus , its production rate equals to the activity that can be measured directly ( see below ) . therefore , most of the cre ages are determined by using the radioactive - stable nuclei pairs , for instance @xmath1be-@xmath3ne , @xmath2al-@xmath3ne , @xmath4cl-@xmath4ar@xcite .",
    "the cre ages of lunar rocks on the rim of lunar craters are particularly important to date the impact events that excavated these rocks to gcr irradiation@xcite .",
    "these ages can be used to calibrate the relative ages of lunar surface determined by the morphology craters@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a monte carlo model based on geant4 software package to calculate the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei . before applying this model to extensive studies",
    ", it is needed to test the validity of it . to this end",
    ", we choose the apollo 15 long drill core as research object .",
    "it is because its chemical composition , location , shielding depth of samples are known clearly .",
    "in addition , apollo 15 drill core is the least disturbed sample among the three deep drill cores , apollo 15 , 16 and 17 .",
    "the production rates of long - lived nuclei @xmath1be and @xmath2al are calculated and compared with experimental data .",
    "this paper is oganized as follows : in section 2 we describe the theoretical model , and in section 3 we discuss the numerical results , a summary and outlook is given in section 4 .",
    "the shape and size of meteoroids ( i.e. , the precursor of the meteorites ) are difficult to determine directly from that of meteorites due to the unknown degree of ablation and fragmentation . for simplicity ,",
    "the meteoroids are usually regarded as a sphere with radius @xmath5 and uniform chemical composition . under this assumption , the general formula of the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei @xmath6 at the depth @xmath7 under the surface of a meteoroid",
    "is shown as follows@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the concentration of element @xmath10 in the meteoroid , @xmath11 is the differential flux of particle @xmath12 ( in this work we only consider protons and neutrons ) , @xmath13 is the excitation function of the involved nuclear reaction for the production of nuclide @xmath6 from element @xmath10 induced by particle @xmath12 at incident energy @xmath14 .    before the meteoroids impacting the earth s atmosphere , they are irradiated by galactic cosmic rays . in this work , we take the most abundant proton and @xmath0 particles in gcrs as primary particles , which bombard the surface of meteoroids isotropically .",
    "the fluxes of proton and @xmath0 particle are taken as follows@xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 in these two formulas @xmath14 denotes the energy per nucleon in mev , @xmath17 is the solar modulation parameter in mv , and @xmath18 mev is the rest mass of proton . in eq.(2 ) @xmath19(@xmath20 s mev)@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in eq.(3 ) @xmath24(@xmath20 s mev)@xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "these formulas are implemented into the geant4 code to sample the primary protons and @xmath0 particles .",
    "when the high energy protons and @xmath0 particles bombard the meteoroid , they will interact with the atoms and nuclei therein .",
    "the dominant processes are ionizing energy loss and spallation reactions . by ionizing energy loss",
    "the energy of primary particles will decrease continuously . and by the spallation reactions",
    "many secondary particles , such as protons , neutrons and mesons , are produced .",
    "the secondary particles , especially neutrons will induce lower - energy ( @xmath27 mev ) reactions , and the very low - energy neutrons will account for neutron capture reactions .    as shown in eq.(1 ) , in order to calculate the production rate one must search for a method to obtain the differential fluxes of proton and neutron in the irradiated body .",
    "the monte carlo simulation is a good choice for these calculations . among various monte carlo",
    "based software , the geant4@xcite has been used more and more widely in nuclear physics and space science@xcite . in our recent work@xcite",
    ", the neutron fluxes escaped from the lunar surface has been investigated using the geant4 software . in the present work",
    "we will also use this software to calculate the proton and neutron fluxes beneath the meteoroid surface . in order to obtain the differential fluxes of active particles ,",
    "the energies of primary and secondary proton and neutron at different depths are recorded and saved as root files .",
    "then we obtain the numerical differential fluxes of different particles by analyzing the root file .",
    "however , due to the statistical nature of the monte carlo method , there are statistical fluctuations in the fluxes . to calculate the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei by eq.(1 )",
    ", it is necessary to obtain the analytical expressions of proton and neutron fluxes by the best - fit procedure .",
    "once the analytical expressions for fluxes are obtained , one can calculate the production rate of interesting nuclei by combining these fluxes formulas with the nuclear reaction cross sections .",
    "the cross sections of proton induced reactions can be taken from experimental data .",
    "however , the cross sections for high energy neutron induced reactions are obtained in indirect ways , for instance the thick target irradiation experiment .",
    "it is because the neutron is a neutral particle that can not be accelerated to any energy . in this paper",
    "we will use the evaluated proton cross sections by nishiizumi et al.@xcite and neutron cross sections by reedy@xcite .    up to now , the physical model to calculate the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei has been established .",
    "after apply this model to extensive studies , it is needed to test the validation of this model . to this end , we choose the lunar drill core as research object .",
    "it is because its chemical composition , location , shielding depth of samples are known clearly .",
    "in addition , apollo 15 drill core is the least disturbed sample among the three deep drill cores , apollo 15 , 16 and 17@xcite . in this case",
    "the radius of moon can be regarded as infinite , and the surface can be seen as a plane . in simulations",
    "we establish a sufficient large box filled with the average chemical composition of apollo 15 drill core@xcite , the gcrs incident on the upper surface of it . in this work ,",
    "the box is taken as 100 m long @xmath28 100 width @xmath28 20 m thickness .",
    "this box is filled with uniform lunar soils .",
    "the chemical composition is : o ( 43.0% wt ) , si ( 22.1% wt ) , al ( 7.67% wt ) , ca ( 7.52 % wt ) , mg ( 5.89 % wt ) , fe ( 11.57 % wt ) , ti ( 1.12 % wt ) , na ( 0.332 % wt ) , and k ( 0.21 % wt ) . here",
    ", % wt denotes the weight percentage .",
    "the gcrs , sampled according to eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , incident on the upper surface of this box isotropically .",
    "considering both the statistical accuracy and time cost , 5 million particles are sampled .",
    "once the production rate is calculated one can derive the cosmic ray exposure ( cre ) age by using the relations as follows : for a stable cosmogenic nuclide @xmath29 and for a radioactive cosmogenic nuclide with the decay constant @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cre age and @xmath33 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are the concentration and production rate of stable ( radioactive ) nuclide .",
    "the basic unit of the cosmogenic nuclei concentration is the number of atoms per gram sample ( atoms/(g sample ) ) . in literatures ,",
    "the concentrations of radioactive nuclei are often reported as radioactive activity , in unit of disintegrations per minute per kilogram ( dpm kg@xmath21 ) .",
    "the relationship between the concentration and the activity is @xmath36 from this equation , one can see that if the cre age is much longer than the half - life of this nuclide , the radioactive equilibrium will be reached and the activity is approximately equal to the production rate . for this case",
    "the measured quantity can be compared directly with the calculated ones . in this paper",
    ", we will choose the nuclei whose half - lives are much longer than the time by which the lunar core are returned from the moon and much shorter than the cre age .",
    "@xmath1be ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath2al ( @xmath38 ) are good candidates .",
    "according to the theoretical model described in sec.2 , we write the geant4 code to simulate the transportation and interaction of gcrs in the lunar surface . in simulations ,",
    "the neutrons and protons at different depths are recorded and saved as root files , from which we obtain the differential fluxes for many energy bins .",
    "then the differential fluxes for neutron and proton at different energy ranges are fitted , respectively .",
    "after careful analysis we found that the proton and neutron fluxes can be expressed quite well by the following formulas : @xmath39 @xmath40    in these formulas the energy @xmath14 is in mev , and the @xmath41 s are depth and chemical dependent parameters .",
    "these formulas are much simpler than that used by arnold@xcite and reedy@xcite .",
    "the parameters are determined by the best - fit procedure using the root software . considering the limit of space we will not give the numerical results of theses parameters .",
    "the proton and neutron fluxes calculated using eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) at depths @xmath42 g/@xmath20 are shown in fig.1 . here",
    "the depth @xmath7 is the geometrical depth times the density , the unit is g/@xmath20 . in this figure",
    "the fluxes are not normalized to particles/(@xmath20 s mev ) since we are interested to the relative magnitude of proton and neutron fluxes . from this figure",
    ", one can see that at high energy range ( @xmath43 mev ) the proton flux is larger than that of neutron , but at low energy range ( @xmath27 mev ) the neutron flux is larger than that of proton .",
    "it is because the protons beneath the lunar surface include the primary and secondary ones , but the neutrons are purely secondary particles .",
    "the secondary protons will suffer ionizing loss and stop quickly .",
    "g/@xmath20.,width=377 ]    as for the cross sections for proton and neutron induced reactions , the most newly evaluated data are used .",
    "the proton cross sections are taken from@xcite , and the neutron cross sections are taken from@xcite .",
    "the numerical data for the cross sections involved are shown in figs.2 - 4 .",
    "be on target elements o , mg , al , si , fe .",
    "these data are taken from@xcite.,width=377 ]     the excitation function for proton induced reactions to produce @xmath2al on target elements mg , al , si , ca , ti , fe . these data are taken from@xcite.,width=377 ]    be on target elements o , si , and @xmath2al on elements al , si . these data are taken from@xcite.,width=377 ]    from these figures one can see clearly that the excitation functions for these reactions are not smooth .",
    "it is because the spallation reaction is a very complex process , the spallation cross sections are very difficult to calculate .",
    "therefore , these functions are obtained by interpolating the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , there are only a few data available , even for neutron induced reactions .",
    "be in apollo 15 drill core .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    ", width=377 ]    al in apollo 15 drill core .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    ", width=377 ]    finally , the production rates of cosmogenic nuclei @xmath1be and @xmath2al are calculated by integrating the depth - dependent fluxes of active particles with the excitation functions of nuclear reactions involved . by using this method , the production rate of @xmath1be and @xmath2al in apollo 15 drill core are calculated . in calculations ,",
    "the production rates result from proton induced reactions and neutron induced reactions are considered . as for proton induced reactions the target elements we considered are o , mg , al ,",
    "si , fe for @xmath1be , al , si , ca , ti , fe for @xmath2al .",
    "as for neutron induced reactions the cross sections are very scattered .",
    "the target elements we considered are o and si for @xmath1be , al and si for @xmath2al . in order to compare with experimental data , we introduce two normalization factors for the production rates for neutron and proton induced reactions : @xmath44 where @xmath35 is the total production rate of radioactive nuclei , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the contributions due to proton and neutron induced reactions , respectively , calculated using the theoretical model shown in sec.2 .",
    "the main reasons of introducing these factors are as follows : ( 1 ) the excitation functions are obtained by interpolating a small number of cross section data , particularly the neutron cross section data are obtained by indirect method ; ( 2 ) the secondary proton and neutron yields calculated by geant4 depend on the theoretical model of spallation reactions ; ( 3 ) the spectrum of primary cosmic rays are assumed to be the current mean value averaged during the solar activity cycle .",
    "that is to say the uncertainties on the primary gcr fluxes , secondary particle fluxes and excitation functions in the theoretical model are normalized by two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these two parameters can be obtained by the best - fit procedure .",
    "the theoretical and experimental results are shown in figs.5 - 6 . in these figures",
    "the dotted line and dashed line represent the contributions from proton and neutron induced reactions , respectively , and the solid lines denote the total production rate .",
    "the experimental data ( denoted by circles ) for @xmath1be are taken from @xcite , and the data for @xmath2al are taken from@xcite . from these two figures",
    "one can see that the theoretical production rate of @xmath1be and @xmath2al agree well with the measured data .",
    "in addition , the production rate from neutron induced reactions are larger than that of proton induced reactions . in other words , the neutron reactions dominate the production of cosmogenic nuclei , hence the high - energy neutron reaction cross sections play crucial roles .",
    "in summary , a physical model based on the monte carlo method is proposed to calculate the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei .",
    "a geant4 code has been developed to simulate the transport and interactions of the primary and secondary particles in the extra - terrestrial body . as a test of this model",
    "we calculate the production rate of long - lived nuclei @xmath1be , @xmath2al in the apollo 15 drill core .",
    "the information of neutrons and protons at different depths are recorded and saved as root file .",
    "then the neutron and proton differential fluxes are obtained by using root software . by combining the differential fluxes and the newly evaluated spallation cross sections",
    "the production rates of @xmath1be , @xmath2al are calculated and compared with experimental data .",
    "the results show that the theoretical production rates agree quite well with the measured data for the apollo 15 long drill core .",
    "it means that our model is suitable to investigate the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei in extra - terrestrial body .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that this model can be applied to the investigation of production rate of cosmogenic nuclei in meteorites and earth s atmosphere .",
    "furthermore , according to the chinese lunar exploration program , lunar samples will be returned 10 years later or so .",
    "when lunar samples are obtained the cosmic ray exposure history of the landing sites is an important subject of research .",
    "for instance , the cosmic ray exposure age of the crater rims can be used to date the impact events and to calibrate the geological age of that region defined by the counting rate of impact craters . to reach this goal ,",
    "it is needed to improve this model by using better physical model of high energy nuclear reactions and more accurate cross sections of proton and neutron induced reactions . as for the former",
    ", we can expect that with the improvement of the nuclear reaction model , for instance li@xmath47ge intranuclear cascade ( incl ) model@xcite , the proton and neutron spectrum can be calculated more and more accurate . in the next , we will study the influences of different nuclear reaction models on the proton and neutron fluxes . as for the latter , the neutron cross sections measured by using the quasi - monoenergetic neuron beams produced by @xmath48li(p , n)@xmath48be reaction within the european hindas ( high- and intermediate - energy data for accelerator - driven systems ) project@xcite will give us unprecedented opportunity to study the production rate of cosmogenic nuclei ."
