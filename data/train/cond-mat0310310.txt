    "in a recent paper [ 1 ] , following the suggestions of roddick and stroud [ 2 ] and of emery and kivelson [ 3 - 6 ] , we have examined the possibility that a classical xy - model might explain _ both _ the @xmath0-plane and the @xmath1-axis electromagnetic response of optimaly doped single crystal ybco [ 7 ] .",
    "a monte carlo study was applied to a bilayer model for ybco in which all the microscopic degrees of freedom are assumed to be integrated out except for the phase of the superconducting order parameter and all of the phase dynamics results from josephson couplings within the layers and between the layers grouped in a stack of bilayers .",
    "we calculated the temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence of the helicity moduli which in this model correspond to the inverse square of the magnetic field penetration depths @xmath4 , @xmath5 , i.e.  to the superfluid densities @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "our results were in sharp contrast with experiment [ 7 ] : while we found that both @xmath0-plane and the @xmath1-axis superfluid densities decrease linearly with @xmath2 at low temperatures , experimentally only the @xmath0-plane superfluid density drops linearly with temperature at low @xmath2 .",
    "the observed @xmath1-axis penetration depth @xmath5 never has the linear temperature dependence found in @xmath0-plane .",
    "here we extend the model of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] to include the quantum effects associated with the coulomb charging energy due to the excess number of cooper pairs within coarse - grained regions with linear dimensions on the order of the superconducting coherence length .",
    "as we are primarily interested in the low temperature helicity moduli of this anisotropic , but three - dimensional , model we apply the variational self - consistent phonon approximation of wood and stroud [ 8 ] .",
    "the inhomogeneity of josephson couplings and layer spacings perpendicular to the layers makes the calculation of the @xmath8-axis helicity modulus a nontrivial extension of the work by roddick and stroud [ 2 ] .",
    "moreover we specifically address the analytic form ( power law behavior ) of the temperature dependence in the in - plane and out - of - plane superfluid densities by calculating the relevant weighted phase - phonon densities of states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss our model and derive the expressions for the helicity moduli within the self - consistent phonon approximation .",

    "the model considered here differs from the one examined by roddick and stroud [ 2 ] in that the josephson coupling constant between two layers within a given bilayer @xmath20 and their spacing @xmath21 are different from the josephson coupling constant between layers in two adjacent bilayers @xmath22 and the bilayer spacing @xmath23 . as a result , the calculation of the helicity modulus @xmath24 along direction perpendicular to the bilayers",
