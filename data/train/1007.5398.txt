    "the recent theoretical prediction and subsequential experimental verification of the conducting surface state existing in a _ strong topological insulator _ ( ti ) has generated a burst of activity , reviewed in refs .   and .",
    "in a ti , strong spin - orbit couplings and band inversion conspire to produce a unique time - reversal invariant topological state different from a conventional band insulator . using bi@xmath0se@xmath1 as reference ti material",
    ", one finds a rather large bulk gap @xmath2  mev , and surface probe experiments have provided strong evidence for the topologically protected gapless surface state.@xcite the measured spin texture of the surface is well described by two - dimensional ( 2d ) massless dirac fermions , where the spinor wavefunction has precisely two entries corresponding to physical spin . under this `` relativistic '' description , spin and momentum",
    "are always perpendicular , and the surface state is stable against the effects of weak disorder and weak interactions due to the underlying topological protection.@xcite useful insights can then already be obtained from a noninteracting disorder - free description .",
    "massless 2d dirac fermions are also realized in single carbon monolayers of _ graphene _ , for reviews see refs .  , and .",
    "the limit of ballistic transport in this 2d material seems experimentally within reach,@xcite and graphene experiments have reported characteristic dirac fermion signatures , e.g. , klein tunneling.@xcite in most experiments performed so far , correlation effects turned out to be weak , and it is again of interest to examine the single - particle theory in the absence of disorder .",
    "in contrast to the ti surface case , the two entries of the spinor wavefunction in graphene correspond to the two atoms in the basis of graphene s honeycomb lattice .",
    "furthermore , there are four dirac fermion `` flavors '' in graphene , due to the physical spin and the @xmath3 ( `` valley '' ) orbital degeneracy.@xcite another condensed - matter realization of dirac fermions is given by the quasiparticles in @xmath4-wave superconductors,@xcite but to be specific , we here focus on the surface state in a ti and on monolayer graphene .",
    "the fact that the electronic properties of both these applications correspond to massless 2d dirac fermions calls for a unified description of their transport properties . in the graphene context , much theoretical effort has been devoted to advancing the scattering theory of dirac fermions in electrostatic potentials,@xcite in particular for the coulomb impurity.@xcite in this paper , we instead study the scattering of massless dirac fermions by a local _",

    "another possibility is to use a type - ii superconductor film instead of the fm layer.@xcite    previous theory work on tis in inhomogeneous magnetic fields has addressed only a few setups . for the transmission of an electron through a magnetic barrier ( assumed homogeneous in the transverse direction ) , as a function of either exchange field or applied bias voltage , mondal _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite predict an oscillatory behavior or even a complete suppression of the transmission probability , and hence of the conductance .",
    "a spin valve geometry with two adjacent magnetic barriers , characterized by non - collinear exchange fields , has also been studied.@xcite as a model for a classical magnetic impurity , the spin - resolved density of states was calculated for a disc - shaped magnetic field profile.@xcite    for graphene , a vector potential perturbation can again be due to external orbital fields , but may also describe the effects of strain@xcite and dislocations or other topological defects.@xcite several theoretical works have addressed aspects of the electronic structure and the transmission properties for dirac fermions in graphene in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the simplest case is encountered for effectively 1d problems with translational invariance in the ( say ) @xmath5-direction , e.g. , for a magnetic step or a magnetic barrier.@xcite for suitable 1d magnetic field profiles , it is possible to have magnetic waveguides ( along the @xmath5-direction),@xcite where electron - electron interaction effects play an important role.@xcite periodic magnetic fields , i.e. , 1d magnetic superlattices , have also been addressed.@xcite for radially symmetric fields , total angular momentum conservation again simplifies the problem and gives an effective 1d theory .",
    "this has allowed for studies of quantum dot or antidot geometries,@xcite where true bound states , not affected by klein tunneling , may exist . in quantum dot setups ,",
    "interaction effects become important for strong confinement.@xcite when the vector potential corresponds to an infinitely thin solenoid , we encounter an ultra - relativistic dirac fermion generalization of the celebrated aharonov - bohm ( ab ) calculation.@xcite this generalization was discussed before,@xcite and exact results for the transmission amplitude can be deduced .",
    "recent studies have also addressed the current induced by an ab flux@xcite and the behavior of the conductance when the chemical potential is precisely at the dirac neutrality point.@xcite such an ab conductance can be probed experimentally in ring - shaped graphene devices.@xcite    in this article , we formulate a general scattering theory approach for massless 2d dirac fermions in the presence of such magnetic perturbations . in sec .",

    "finally , some concluding remarks can be found in sec .",
    "in this section , we describe the 2d dirac fermion model for electronic transport in graphene or the ti surface studied in this work . as perturbations ,",
    "we first allow for an external static vector potential , @xmath6 with @xmath7 , which is included by minimal coupling and describes orbital magnetic fields and ( for graphene ) strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , for those applications we have @xmath8 , see below .",
    "in addition , for the ti case , we allow for a zeeman field or for exchange fields caused by nearby ferromagnets , whose components are contained in the field @xmath9 , where prefactors such as the bohr magneton or the land factor are included . with the pauli matrices",
    "@xmath10 and the momentum operator @xmath11 , the single - particle model reads ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 the fermi velocity in graphene is @xmath14  m / s , while for a ti surface state , a typical value@xcite for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is @xmath15  m / s . the low - energy hamiltonian in eq",
    ".   is valid on energy scales close to the neutrality level ( dirac point ) , well below the bulk band gap for the ti case and within a window of size @xmath16  ev for graphene .",
    "both the vector potential @xmath17 and the field @xmath18 can now be combined to a vector field @xmath19 which contains all considered `` magnetic '' perturbations .",

    "we have put @xmath35 , which is the case for all fields studied below .",
    "let us now discuss how eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) relates to the surface states in a _",
    "strong topological insulator _",
    ", where the spin direction is tangential to the surface and perpendicular to momentum .",
    "for a given two - component spinor wavefunction @xmath36 , the spin ( @xmath37 ) and particle current ( @xmath38 ) density operators are@xcite @xmath39 i.e. , both spin and current are confined to the surface and obey @xmath40 . under stationary conditions ,",
    "the continuity equation , @xmath41 , implies the relation @xmath42 which is linked to the unitarity property of the scattering matrix .",
    "equation ( [ dirac ] ) then allows to describe the following setups for the ti surface state .",
    "first , an orbital magnetic field has only effects when it is oriented perpendicular to the surface , @xmath43 . in cylindrical coordinates",
    ", we can then choose some gauge for the vector potential @xmath17 such that @xmath44 while @xmath45 drops out and is put to zero .",

    "@xmath46 , e.g. , due to the magnetization of a nearby fm layer , we write @xmath47 with @xmath48 , where we used the spin pauli matrices in eq .",
    "( [ spinpauli ] ) . for a zeeman field",
    ", we can proceed in complete analogy where @xmath49 now denotes the zeeman field .",
    "a zeeman or exchange field oriented along the @xmath27 direction can open a gap in the spectrum , and here we assume that such fields are not present . while the orbital field breaks time reversal invariance , the zeeman or exchange fields represent a time - reversal invariant perturbation",
    ". then @xmath50 is determined by the magnetic field itself , and hence is not a gauge field anymore .",
    "next we turn to _ graphene _ , where the pauli matrices @xmath51 are related to the two triangular sublattices constituting graphene s honeycomb lattice .",
    "we assume that no spin - flip mechanisms are relevant , i.e. , physical spin is conserved .",
    "we can then focus on one specific dirac fermion flavor with fixed valley index and spin direction .",
    "this excludes exchange or zeeman fields , i.e. , we put @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 for graphene . note",
    "that zeeman fields in graphene are generally small compared to orbital fields.@xcite moreover , we consider only smoothly varying vector potentials such that it is indeed sufficient to retain only one @xmath54 point.@xcite equation can then describe the following cases .",
    "first , we may have an orbital magnetic field , precisely as for the ti case .",
    "second , pseudo - magnetic fields generated by strain - induced forces,@xcite or by various types of defects , e.g. , dislocations,@xcite also correspond to a vector potential , where time reversal invariance implies that @xmath17 has opposite sign at the two @xmath54 points .",
    "@xmath55 can then be expressed explicitly in terms of the strain tensor,@xcite where the resulting pseudo - magnetic field is also oriented along the @xmath27 axis and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , strain causes a scalar potential @xmath21 , which is , however , strongly reduced by screening effects .",
    "the combination of orbital and pseudo - magnetic fields may allow to design a valley filter , since the total ( orbital plus pseudo - magnetic ) fields can differ significantly at both @xmath54 points.@xcite      our scattering theory approach considers magnetic fields [ described by @xmath20 in eq .  ]",
    "that smoothly vary on the scale of a lattice spacing and constitute a _ local _",
    "perturbation , i.e. , a well - defined cylindrical multipole expansion exists .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is assumed throughout . as we show below , for orbital fields we can choose a gauge where @xmath57 .",
    "for strain - induced fields , strictly speaking , the problem is not gauge invariant , and we can not impose gauge conditions . however , in a more narrow sense , a gauge degree of freedom still exists.@xcite for @xmath58 , with complex - valued coefficients @xmath59 , we then have the multipole expansion @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the total flux in units of the flux quantum @xmath62 .",
    "let us now address the orbital magnetic field case , @xmath53 , where we can exploit gauge invariance .",
    "we start from a more general situation with @xmath63 , expressed as in eq .   with coefficients @xmath64 , and",
    "also allow for nonzero coefficients @xmath65 .",
    "we now show that one can choose a gauge where @xmath57 and @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , gauge invariance implies that for arbitrary functions @xmath67 , we are free to replace @xmath68 . using a multipole expansion for @xmath69 with coefficients @xmath70 , an equivalent gauge choice thus follows by the replacement @xmath71",
    "we then choose the gauge function @xmath72 in the new gauge , we arrive at eq .",

    "for given energy @xmath79 , where @xmath80 throughout , the dirac equation , @xmath81 with eq .  , has scattering solutions that we wish to obtain in the presence of magnetic perturbations of the type in eq .  .",
    "the solution for @xmath82 follows simply by reversing the sign of the lower spinor component.@xcite we are then looking for a solution @xmath83 consisting , in the asymptotic regime @xmath58 , of a plane wave ( @xmath84 ) propagating along the positive @xmath85-direction , @xmath86 plus the scattered outgoing spherical wave,@xcite @xmath87 we adopt the same normalization conventions as novikov.@xcite from eq .",
