    "the thermonuclear explosion of a chandrasekhar mass c+o white dwarf is presently the most promising candidate to explain the majority of type ia supernova ( sn ia ) events ( hflich et al .",
    "however , the complex phenomenology of turbulent thermonuclear flames and deflagration - detonation - transitions ( ddts ) renders a self - consistent description of the explosion mechanism extremely difficult ( khokhlov 1995 , niemeyer et al .",
    "1996 , niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) .",
    "the open questions can be broadly classified as macroscopic ones , pertaining to the global structure of the flame front and the buoyancy - driven production of turbulence , and microscopic ones including turbulence - flame interactions on scales of the flame thickness and pre - conditioning for ddt . in this work , first results of an investigation of the latter will be presented , obtained from direct numerical simulations of a simplified flame model coupled to a three - dimensional incompressible turbulent flow .",
    "based on the observational evidence of intermediate elements in sn ia spectra , detonations can be ruled out as the initial combustion mode after onset of the thermonuclear runaway , as they would predict the complete incineration of the white dwarf to iron group nuclei .",
    "deflagrations , on the other hand , are hydrodynamically unstable to both flame intrinsic ( landau - darrieus ) and buoyancy - driven ( rayleigh - taylor , rt ) instabilities . while the former is stabilized in the nonlinear regime , the latter produces a growing , fully turbulent rt - mixing region of hot burning products and cold `` fuel '' , separated by the thin thermonuclear flame .",
    "driven predominantly by the shear flow surrounding buoyant large - scale bubbles , turbulent velocity fluctuations cascade down to the kolmogorov scale @xmath5 , which may , under certain conditions , be smaller than the laminar flame thickness ( section 2 ) .",
    "this regime is unknown territory for flame modeling ; although it has been speculated in the supernova literature that the effect of turbulence on the laminar flame structure is negligible as long as the velocity fluctuations are sufficiently weak , the existence of turbulent eddies on scales smaller than the flame thickness  regardless of their velocity  is in conflict with the definition of the `` flamelet regime '' in the flamelet theory of turbulent combustion ( peters 1984 ) .",
    "no numerical or experimental evidence to confirm and quantify this speculation has been available so far .",
    "as the explosion proceeds , the turbulence intensity grows while the flame slows down and thickens as a consequence of the decreasing material density of the expanding star . after some time",
    ", small scale turbulence must be expected to significantly alter the flame structure and its local propagation velocity with respect to the laminar solution . on the other hand , most subgrid - scale models for the turbulent thermonuclear flame brush in numerical simulations of supernovae depend crucially on the assumption of a ( nearly ) laminar flame structure on small scales ( niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 , khokhlov 1995 , niemeyer et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the intent of this work is to present a first approach to study the regions of validity and the possible breakdown of this `` thermonuclear flamelet '' assumption .",
    "specifically , a modification of peters ( 1984 ) flamelet definition suggested by niemeyer & kerstein ( 1997 ) will be tested .",
    "in addition to the verification of subgrid - scale models , this inquiry is relevant in the context of ddts which were suggested to occur in sn ia explosions after an initial turbulent deflagration phase ( khokhlov 1991 , woosley & weaver 1994 ) . a specific mechanism for ddt in sn ia explosions based on strong turbulent straining of the flame front and transition to the distributed burning regime has been proposed ( niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) .",
    "the ratio of laminar flame speed to turbulence velocity on the scale of the flame thickness , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the laminar thermal flame thickness , has been suggested as a control parameter indicating the transition to distributed burning when @xmath8 ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) .",
    "one of the main results presented below is that the transition to distributed burning was not observed in the parameter range ( @xmath9 ) that we were able to probe .",
    "thermonuclear burning fronts are similar in many ways to premixed chemical flames .",
    "the issues addressed in this work are motivated in the framework of supernova research , but our results apply equally well to premixed chemical flames with low prandtl numbers and small thermal expansion rates . in order to facilitate numerical computations , we modeled the flame with a single scalar reaction - diffusion equation that is advected in a three - dimensional , driven incompressible turbulent flow .",
    "the arguments justifying these simplifications are outlined in section 2 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we shall summarize the most important parameters and dimensional relations of thermonuclear flames and buoyancy - driven turbulence in section 2 , followed by a brief description of the numerical methods employed for this work ( section 3 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "the results of a series of direct simulations of a highly simplified flame propagating through a turbulent medium are discussed and interpreted in the framework of sn ia modeling .",
    "the laminar properties of thermonuclear flames in white dwarfs were investigated in detail by timmes & woosley ( 1992 ) , including all relevant nuclear reactions and microscopic transport mechanisms .",
    "the authors found that the laminar flame speed , @xmath1 , varies between @xmath10 and @xmath11 cm s@xmath12 as the density declines from @xmath13 to @xmath14 g @xmath15 .",
    "the thermal flame thickness , @xmath7 , grows from @xmath16 to @xmath17 cm for the same density variation .",
    "microscopic transport is dominated entirely by electrons close to the fermi energy by virtue of their near - luminal velocity distribution and large mean - free - paths . as a consequence , ionic diffusion of nuclei",
    "is negligibly small compared with heat transport and viscosity . comparing the latter two ,",
    "one finds typical values for the prandtl number of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the thermal diffusivity and viscosity , respectively ( nandkumar & pethick 1984 ) .",
    "further , partial electron degeneracy in the burning products limits the density contrast , @xmath21 , between burned and unburned material to very small values , @xmath22 .    to within reasonable accuracy , one may estimate the magnitude of large - scale turbulent velocity fluctuations , @xmath23 , from the rise velocity of buoyant bubbles with diameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the gravitational acceleration . inserting typical values , @xmath27 cm , @xmath28 cm s@xmath29 , and @xmath30 , one finds @xmath31",
    "cm s@xmath12 . for a viscosity of @xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath12 ( nandkumar & pethick 1984 ) ,",
    "this yields the integral - scale reynolds number @xmath34 and a characteristic kolmogorov scale @xmath35 cm .",
    "hence , it is clear that soon after the onset of the explosion , turbulent eddies are present on scales smaller than the laminar flame thickness . in conventional flamelet theory ( peters 1984 ) ,",
    "the `` flamelet regime '' is defined based on length - scale arguments alone ; that is , if the characteristic length - scale of the flame is smaller than the kolmogorov length , the turbulent flame is said to be in the flamelet regime .",
    "thus , according to conventional flamelet theory , the scaling arguments offered here would clearly indicate that these thermonuclear flames are not in the flamelet regime .",
    "therefore , flamelet - based models such as those used in almost all multidimensional sn ia simulations would not appear to be applicable for these flames .",
    "however , the low prandtl number of degenerate matter allows a situation in which the kolmogorov time scale , @xmath36 , is larger than the reaction time scale @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the fuel consumption rate ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) .",
    "this is readily seen by setting @xmath39 equal to the diffusion time scale @xmath40 for stationary flames ( where @xmath19 is the microscopic thermal diffusivity ) , yielding @xmath41 even if the length scale ratio on the @xmath42 is less than unity , the @xmath43 can be large for a sufficiently small @xmath44 . in this case ,",
    "small eddies are burned before their motion can appreciably affect the flame structure .",
    "an alternative , @xmath44-independent , criterion for flamelet breakdown has been proposed ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) , based on the relative importance of eddy diffusivity , @xmath45 , and microscopic heat conductivity on scales @xmath46 . as @xmath47 is , in general , a growing function of scale , the condition @xmath48 is sufficient and can be invoked to define the flamelet burning regime . using the relation @xmath49",
    ", one finds the more intuitive formulation @xmath50 . in other words , the flame structure on scales @xmath7 and below is dominated by heat diffusion as long as the characteristic velocity associated with eddies of a length scale the same order as the laminar flame thickness is smaller than the laminar flame speed . if heat diffusion is the only relevant microscopic transport process , the local flame speed is expected to remain comparable to @xmath1 despite the presence of eddies within the flame .",
    "this paper attempts to establish whether or not the newly proposed scaling relationship of niemeyer & kerstein is an appropriate definition of the flamelet regime for thermonuclear flames , and , more generally , whether or not these thermonuclear flames can be treated as flamelets in numerical simulations . in order to be able to efficiently address this question , we make three assumptions that greatly simplify the problem without violating the underlying physics .",
    "firstly , we note that nuclear energy generation is dominated by carbon burning which has a very strong dependence on temperature ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "therefore , the flame dynamics can be well approximated by a single , diffusive progress variable @xmath52 that is advected by the fluid and coupled to a strongly nonlinear source term that mimics nuclear burning .",
    "second , the small value of @xmath53 suggests that dilatation effects do not play a significant role and may be neglected for the purpose of this study .",
    "this , together with the small mach number of turbulent fluctuations on very small scales , justifies the use of the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "finally , we assume that the effect of the turbulent cascade from large scales can be adequately modeled by forcing the flow field on the lowest wavenumbers of the simulation .",
    "the code used to simulate the thermonuclear flame used the pseudo - spectral approach , where derivatives are taken in fourier space but non - linear terms are evaluated in real space ( ruetsch & maxey 1991 ) .",
    "the diffusive term is evaluated implicitly , such that the code provided stable , accurate solutions , even for very small prandtl numbers .",
    "all boundary conditions were periodic , and energy was added at every time step to the lowest wavenumbers by solving a langevin equation as described in eswaran and pope ( 1988a , 1988b ) . all of the simulations were carried out in a @xmath54 domain , and were run for several eddy - turnover times so as to obtain statistical stationarity .    as was mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the main reaction participating in thermonuclear flame is roughly @xmath55 .",
    "it was found that a source term @xmath56 ( where the @xmath57 arises from the dependence of the reaction on reactant concentration ) produced too narrow a reaction zone to be easily resolved in space in a three - dimensional simulation .",
    "instead , it was decided to use a source term of @xmath58 , which is still strongly non - linear , but produces a reaction zone that can be resolved in a practical three - dimensional simulation .",
    "one difficulty that arises in using a pseudo - spectral code to simulate premixed combustion is that the scalar field  in this case , the progress variable  must be periodic .",
    "this was achieved by separating the scalar field into two components  a uniform gradient in the direction of propagation of the flame was subtracted such that the remaining field was zero at each end of the periodic box in that direction .",
    "thus , where @xmath59 is the transport equation for the progress variable with constant properties , if a uniform gradient @xmath60 in the @xmath61 direction ( the direction of propagation of the flame ) is subtracted , @xmath62 then the transport equation for the periodic fluctuating component @xmath63 is : @xmath64    so long as the reaction zone remained relatively thin and did not approach the boundaries , @xmath52 remained bounded between 0 and 1 . in order to keep the reaction away from the boundaries , the mean velocity in the direction of propagation was set to the propagation speed of the flame .",
    "this propagation speed was determined at each time step from a volume integral of the source term .",
    "the need to keep the reaction away from the boundaries was found to restrict the simulation to a limited ratio of prandtl number to @xmath65  the flame speed could not be significantly lower than @xmath3 or wrinkles in the flame would become too large to be contained in the domain .",
    "the results of three simulations with varying laminar flame speeds and prandtl numbers are illustrated in figures ( 1 )  ( 6 ) ( see figure captions for the model parameters ) .",
    "note that @xmath66 , with the root - mean - square velocity fluctuation @xmath3 dominated in the simulation by eddies on the scale of the laminar flame thickness , corresponds roughly to the parameter @xmath67 employed in section ( 2 ) to describe the validity of the flamelet assumption based on dimensional analysis .",
    "therefore , one may expect noticeable deviations from locally laminar flame propagation for @xmath68 .",
    "conversely , the dimensional argument predicts that changes of the total burning rate are exclusively due to the growth of the flame surface area by turbulent wrinkling as long as @xmath69 .",
    "we define the turbulent flame speed in terms of the volume integral of the source term , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the grid length .",
    "the wrinkled flame surface area , @xmath72 , is measured by triangular discretization of the @xmath73 isosurface .",
    "for the three cases with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 we find @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) of 1.008 ( 1.008 ) , 1.31 ( 1.27 ) , and 1.51 ( 1.56 ) , respectively .",
    "hence , to within 5 % accuracy the ratio of turbulent and laminar flame speeds is identical to the increase of the flame surface area with respect to the laminar surface , implying that the local flame speed is , on average , equal to @xmath1 in all cases .    in conclusion",
    ", we confirmed  within the limitations of our simplified flame description  that the local propagation speed of turbulent low-@xmath44 premixed flames remains equal to @xmath1 if @xmath79 , even if eddies exist on scales smaller than the flame thickness .",
    "our results show no indication of a breakdown of the flamelet burning regime in the parameter range @xmath80 that was studied .",
    "lower values of @xmath81 were unattainable because large scale flame wrinkling forced regions with nonvanishing @xmath38 over the streamwise grid boundaries , violating the requirement of periodicity of the non - linear component of the progress variable .",
    "this outcome suggests that the conventional definition of the flamelet regime ( peters 1984 ) which is based on a length - scale argument alone should be generalized to a time - scale dependent definition in the sense of niemeyer & kerstein ( 1997 ) .    in the framework of supernova modeling , this result helps to formulate a subgrid - scale model for the turbulent thermonuclear flame brush in large - scale hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "specifically , it is possible to estimate @xmath82 from the filtered density and velocity strain , using an assumed spectrum for the turbulent velocity cascade .",
    "if @xmath83 , a subgrid - scale model based purely on the surface increase by turbulent wrinkling can be employed ( niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 ) . in practice , this is possible for densities above @xmath14 g @xmath15 , where most of the explosion energy is released . for lower densities ( in the late stages of the explosion ) , relevant for the nucleosynthesis of intermediate mass elements and a possible deflagration - detonation - transition ( niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) , a more detailed model accounting for small - scale turbulence flame interactions needs to be developed .",
    "all the currently discussed scenarios for deflagration - detonation - transitions ( ddt ) in the late stage of sn ia explosions require an earlier transition to distributed or well - stirred burning in order to allow pre - conditioning of unburned material .",
    "our results indicate that the flamelet structure of thermonuclear flames is more robust than previously anticipated , hence delaying or even preventing the formation of favorable conditions for ddt during the first expansion phase .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this question , extending the parameter range to lower @xmath82 , is underway ( young , niemeyer & rosner 1999 ) .",
    "we would like to thank joel ferziger , nigel smith , and dan haworth for interesting discussions .",
