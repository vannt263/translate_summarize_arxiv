    "while the final state of a ultrareativistic heavy - ion collision is to a large degree reflected in the measured distribution of hadrons there are different possible evolutions leading to this final state which leave a more subtle imprint on observables such as transverse mass @xmath1 spectra and two particle correlations .",
    "the two extreme assumptions are the boost - invariant model proposed by bjorken @xcite in which the incoming nuclei are nearly transparent and the landau scenario @xcite in which the incoming nuclei are completely stopped and the resulting extremely hot and dense system is assumed to undergo strongly accelerated expansion . in a bjorken expansion matter moves on free streaming trajectories from a source with negligible longitudinal extension ( the initial long .",
    "nuclear overlap ) , leading to rapidity @xmath2 being equal to spacetime rapidity @xmath3 . in this scenario",
    "a plateau in the multiplicity per unit rapidity @xmath0 is expected around @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , it has been argued that @xmath0 at rhic can reasonably well be described with landau hydrodynamcis @xcite . in this scenario , @xmath5",
    ", no plateau is expected and @xmath0 changes strongly in time as the system undergoes longitudinal acceleration .",
    "most 3d hydrodynamic calculations start with initial conditions close to bjorken - like free streaming ( albeit without a plateau in rapidity ) and consequently do not alter @xmath6 significantly during the evolution @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite i have suggested that a significant longitudinal acceleration seems to be necessary if a simultaneous description of transverse mass spectra and hbt correlation radii is required .    in a longitudinal free - flow scenario ( with @xmath0",
    "approximately unchanged ) , the effect dominating the rapidity dependence of hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) radii and @xmath7-spectra is the shape of @xmath0  the amount of thermalized matter at given @xmath8 governs the amount of expansion and flow that can be reached before decoupling .",
    "in contrast , in a scenario in which @xmath0 changes strongly over time , radiation from the expanding system will only contribute to the yield at forward rapidities in later evolution stages as matter accelerates outward .",
    "thus , e.g. the duration of the presence of thermalized matter at forward rapidities will be potentially be smaller than at midrapidity quite independent from variations in @xmath0 . however",
    ", spectra and hbt radii will only reflect this if emission of particles during the evolution time is a significant fraction of the total particle emission inlcuding final breakup .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study to what degree the rapidity dependence of hbt correlation radii is capable of reflecting the evolution history of the system .",
    "i use the model described in @xcite for the analysis .",
    "its main assumption is that an equilibrated system is formed a short time @xmath9 after the onset of the collision .",
    "this thermal fireball subsequently expands isentropically until the mean free path of particles exceeds the dimensions of the system and particles decouple at a timescale @xmath10 .    for the entropy density at a given proper time",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath11 with @xmath12 the proper time as measured in a frame co - moving with a given volume element and @xmath13 two functions describing the shape of the distribution and @xmath14 a normalization factor .",
    "woods - saxon distributions @xmath15\\right ) , \\quad h(\\eta_s , \\tau ) = 1/\\left(1 + \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\eta_s - h_c(\\tau)}{\\eta_{\\text{ws}}}\\right]\\right).\\ ] ] are used to describe the shapes for given @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the ingredients of the model are the skin thickness parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the parametrizations of the expansion of the spatial scales @xmath19 as a function of @xmath16 . for the radial expansion assuming constant acceleration one finds @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is obtained by integrating forward in @xmath16 a trajectory originating from the collision center which is characterized by a rapidity @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the longitudinal velocity of that trajectory . since the relation between proper time as measured in the co - moving frame and lab time",
    "is determined by the rapidity at a given time , the resulting integral is in general non - trivial and solved numerically ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath25 is determined in overlap calculations using glauber theory , the initial size of the rapidity interval occupied by the fireball matter .",
    "the set of model parameters then includes initial rapidity @xmath26 transverse velocity @xmath27 and rapidity at decoupling proper time @xmath28 .",
    "thus , specifying @xmath29 and @xmath10 sets the scales of the spacetime evolution and @xmath17 and @xmath18 specify the detailed distribution of entropy density .    for transverse flow a linear relation between radius @xmath30 and transverse rapidity @xmath31",
    "is assumed with @xmath32 .",
    "the model allows for the possibility of accelerated longitudinal expansion which in general implies @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this mismatch between spacetime and momentum rapidity can be parametrized as a local @xmath34 which is a function of @xmath16 and @xmath35 .    with the help of a quasiparticle equation of state ( eos )",
    ", one can find the local temperature @xmath36 from the entropy density @xmath37 and net baryon density @xmath38 .",
    "particle emission is calculated throughout the lifetime of the fireball by selecting a freeze - out temperature @xmath39 , finding the hypersurface characterized by @xmath40 and evaluating the cooper - frye formula @xmath41 = d^4 x s(x , p)\\ ] ] with @xmath42 the momentum of the emitted particle and @xmath43 its degeneracy factor .",
    "hbt correlation radii are determined as averages of coordinates with the emission function @xcite    @xmath44    where @xmath45    by choosing @xmath26 different from the measured width of @xmath0 it is possible to introduce longitudinal acceleration into the model .",
    "note that the model description can not be assumed to be valid in the target / projectile fragmentation  as one probes forward rapidities , thermal physics is less relevant , evident from the fact that a large fraction of matter is below @xmath46 _ ab initio_. thus , the model prediction beyond @xmath47 should be taken with some caution .",
    "we expect that the spacetime evolution of the emission source is reflected in the @xmath8 dependence of hbt radii only if the system is not dominated by the final breakup .",
    "since freeze - out is determined dynamically , there is no apparent parameter to adjust amount of hadrons released by the final breakup vs. the amount of particles continuously emitted before . from fig .",

    "since particles must move faster than the cooper - frye surface in order to be released , an inward - moving surface implies much more early emission than an outward moving one .",

    "note that the data seem to prefer the solution with expanding @xmath51 , i.e. a sharp surface , at least in the last stages of the evolution .",
    "shockwaves in the medium excited by hard parton energy loss as observed in two particle correlations @xcite could be a potential mechanism for creating such a sharply defined surface .",
    "i investigate rapidity dependence in three different scenarios designed to show the essential effects to be expected : 1 ) a longitudinal free - flow expansion where @xmath0 remains approximately constant during the evolution 2 ) a longitudinally accelerated scenario where the width of @xmath0 changes from 1.7 to 3.8 during the evolution and continuous particle emission occurs and 3 ) a longitudinally accelerated expansion with the same parameters as above but a sudden breakup in the end ( note that case 1 ) is also characterized by a sudden breakup ) . in all three cases single particle @xmath7 spectra",

    "the radii in the sudden breakup scenario are systematically larger than in the continuous emission one , reflecting the fact that freeze - out happens on average later and hence at larger spatial extension .",
    "the sudden drop at @xmath59 is probably an artefact of the model getting sensitive to the target / projectile fragmentation region which is not well described by thermal physics .",
    "the most remarkable finding is that to first order there is hardly any influence of the expansion and freeze - out scenario on the rapidity dependence of hbt correlations .",
    "the reason for this is that the measured single particle spectra and @xmath0 already provide rather stringent constraints on the expansion pattern .",
    "the most pronounced effect of a longitudinally accelerated expansion is the deviation from the scaling @xmath60 , ultimately leading to a smaller @xmath56 in the presence of acceleration while keeping the correct falloff in @xmath54 . for the most part changes in the sideward and outward correlation radii",
    "are minor . since the data practially rule out strong continuous emission throughout the lifetime by @xmath61 , the correlation radii are dominated only by the state of the system at breakup , not by the evolution path .",
