    "character varieties of @xmath1-manifold groups provide a useful tool in understanding the geometric structures of manifolds and notably the presence of essential surfaces . in this paper",
    "we wish to investigate @xmath2-character varieties of symmetric hyperbolic knots in order to pinpoint specific behaviours related to the presence of free or periodic symmetries .",
    "we will be mostly concerned with symmetries of odd prime order and we will concentrate our attention to the subvariety of the character variety which is invariant by the action of the symmetry ( see section  [ s : invariantch ] for a precise definition of this action and of the invariant subvariety ) .    as already observed in @xcite , the excellent component of the character variety containing the character of the holonomy representation is invariant by the symmetry , since the symmetry can be chosen to act as a hyperbolic isometry of the complement of the knot .",
    "hilden , lozano , and montesinos also observed that the invariant subvariety of a hyperbolic symmetric ( more specifically , periodic ) knot can be sometimes easier to determine than the whole variety .",
    "this follows from the fact that the invariant subvariety can be computed using the character variety of a two - component hyperbolic link .",
    "such link is obtained as the quotient of the knot and the axis of its periodic symmetry by the action of the symmetry itself .",
    "indeed , the link is sometimes much  simpler \" than the original knot , in the sense that its fundamental group has a smaller number of generators and relations , making the computation of its character variety feasible .",
    "this is , for instance , the case when the quotient link is a @xmath3-bridge link : hilden , lozano , and montesinos studied precisely this situation and were able to recover a defining equation for the excellent components of several periodic knots up to ten crossings .    in",
    "what follows we will be interested in the structure of the invariant subvariety itself and we will consider not only knots admitting periodic symmetries but also free symmetries .",
    "our main result shows that the invariant subvariety has in general a different behaviour according to whether the knot admits a free or periodic symmetry .",
    "[ thm : main ] if @xmath4 has a periodic symmetry of prime order @xmath5 , then @xmath6 contains at least @xmath7 components that are curves and that are invariant by the symmetry .    on the other hand , for each prime @xmath5 , there is a knot @xmath8 with a free symmetry of order @xmath9 such that the number of components of the invariant character variety of @xmath8 is bounded , independently of @xmath9 .",
    "the main observation here is that the invariant subvariety for a hyperbolic symmetric knot , or more precisely the zariski - open set of its irreducible characters , can be seen as a subvariety of the character variety of a well - chosen two - component hyperbolic link , even when the symmetry is free .    to make the second part of our result more concrete , in section  [ s : examples ]",
    "we study an infinite family of examples all arising from the two - component @xmath3-bridge link @xmath10 in rolfsen s notation ( with @xmath3-bridge invariant @xmath11 ) .",
    "our construction provides infinitely many knots with free symmetries such that the number of irreducible components of the invariant subvarieties of the knots is universally bounded .",
    "the invariant subvarieties of periodic knots over fields of positive characteristic exhibit a peculiar behaviour .",
    "it is well - known that for almost all odd primes @xmath9 the character variety of a finitely presented group resembles the character variety over @xmath12 . for a finite set of primes ,",
    "though , the character variety over @xmath9 may differ from the one over @xmath13 , in the sense that there may be  jumps \" either in the dimension of its irreducible components or in their number . in this case",
    "we say that _ the variety ramifies at @xmath9_. the character varieties of the knots studied in @xcite provide the first examples in which the dimension of a well - defined subvariety of the character variety is larger for certain primes . here",
    "we give an infinite family of periodic knots for which the invariant character variety ramifies at @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the order of the period . in this case",
    ", the ramification means that the number of @xmath14-dimensional components of the invariant subvariety decreases in characteristic @xmath9 .",
    "this gives some more insight in the relationship between the geometry of a knot and the algebra of its character variety , namely the primes that ramify .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section  [ s : quotientlink ] is purely topological and describes how one can construct any symmetric knot starting from a well - chosen two - component link .",
    "section  [ s : chvar ] provides basic facts on character varieties and establishes the setting in which we will work . in section  [ s : invariantch ]",
    "we introduce and study invariant character varieties of symmetric knots .",
    "the first part of theorem  [ thm : main ] on periodic knots is proved in section  [ s : periodic ] while in section  [ s : free ] we study properties of invariant character varieties of knots with free symmetries .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is achieved in section  [ s : examples ] , where an infinite family of free periodic knots with the desired properties is constructed .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : modp ] we describe how the character varieties of knots with period @xmath9 may ramify @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a knot in @xmath15 and let @xmath16 be a finite order diffeomorphism of the pair which preserves the orientation of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath17 acts freely we say that @xmath17 is a _ free symmetry of @xmath4_. if @xmath17 has a global fixed point then , according to the positive solution to smith s conjecture @xcite , the fixed - point set of @xmath17 is an unknotted circle and two situations can arise : either the fixed - point set of @xmath17 is disjoint from @xmath4 , and we say that @xmath17 is a _ periodic symmetry of @xmath4 _ , or it is not . in the latter case @xmath17",
    "has order @xmath3 , its fixed - point set meets @xmath4 in two points , and @xmath17 is called a _ strong inversion of @xmath4_. in all other cases @xmath17 is called a _ semi - periodic symmetry of @xmath4_.    note that if the order of @xmath17 is an odd prime , then @xmath17 can only be a _ free _ or _ periodic symmetry _ of @xmath4 .",
    "we start by recalling some well - known facts and a construction that will be central in the paper .",
    "let @xmath18 be a hyperbolic two - component link in the @xmath1-sphere such that @xmath19 is the trivial knot .",
    "let @xmath20 be an integer and assume that @xmath21 and the linking number of @xmath19 and @xmath22 are coprime .",
    "we can consider the @xmath21-fold cyclic cover @xmath23 of the solid torus @xmath24 which is the exterior of @xmath19 and contains @xmath22 .",
    "the lift of @xmath22 in @xmath25 is a ( connected ) simple closed curve @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be a meridian - longitude system for @xmath19 on @xmath28 and let @xmath29 be its lift on @xmath30 .",
    "the slopes @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , on @xmath30 are equivariant by the action of the cyclic group @xmath33 of deck transformations and the manifold @xmath34 obtained after dehn filling along @xmath35 is @xmath15 .",
    "the action of the group of deck transformations @xmath33 on @xmath25 extends to an action on @xmath34 which is free if @xmath36 is prime with @xmath21 and has a circle of fixed points if @xmath37 . for all other values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the action is semi - periodic , that is a proper subgroup of @xmath33 acts with a circle of fixed points .    for a fixed @xmath38 ,",
    "the image of @xmath26 in @xmath34 is a knot that we will denote by @xmath4 admitting a periodic or free symmetry of order @xmath21 according to whether @xmath37 or prime with @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath21 large enough , the resulting knot @xmath4 is hyperbolic because of thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem @xcite , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ r : surgery ] of course , the above construction can be carried out for arbitrary integer values of @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is not restrictive to require the value of @xmath38 to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the knot @xmath4 resulting from @xmath43 surgery along @xmath25 coincides with the knot @xmath44 obtained the same manner but starting from a different link @xmath45 and choosing @xmath46 as dehn filling slope .",
    "the link @xmath45 is obtained from @xmath47 by dehn surgery of slope @xmath48 along @xmath19 .",
    "the following proposition shows that periodic and free - symmetric knots can always be obtained this way .",
    "[ p : quotientlink ] let @xmath4 be a hyperbolic knot admitting a free or periodic symmetry of order @xmath21 . then there exist a two - component hyperbolic link @xmath18 with @xmath19 the trivial knot , and an integer @xmath49 such that the knot @xmath4 can be obtained by the above construction .    the statement is obvious if the symmetry is periodic : in this case the link @xmath47 consists of the image @xmath19 of the axis of the symmetry and the image @xmath22 of the knot @xmath4 in the quotient of @xmath15 by the action of the symmetry .",
    "hyperbolicity of the link is a straightforward consequence of the hyperbolicity of @xmath4 and the orbifold theorem .",
    "if the symmetry is free , some extra work is necessary .",

    "this is a consequence of the equivariant sphere theorem and the fact that @xmath54 is invariant , hence @xmath55 is irreducible and boundary irreducible .",
    "in addition @xmath56 is not seifert fibered , because a dehn filling on @xmath57 yields @xmath58 , which is hyperbolic .",
    "thus the only obstruction to hyperbolicity is that @xmath59 could be toroidal .",

    "in addition @xmath25 is not knotted , because @xmath57 is the trivial knot but also a satellite with companion @xmath71 .",
    "then the modification consists in replacing @xmath54 by the core of @xmath25 .",
    "this makes @xmath72 boundary parallel , and hence inessential .    finally , we get rid of the tori @xmath68 .",

    "replace equivariantly each @xmath78 by a solid torus .",
    "this does not change @xmath4 , because the balls @xmath79 which are disjoint from @xmath4 are replaced again by balls . on the other hand , this may change @xmath54 to @xmath80 , but since every knot exterior has a degree - one map onto the solid torus , we find a degree - one map from @xmath81 onto @xmath82 , and since @xmath54 is unknotted , so is @xmath80 .",
    "note that for a given @xmath4 the choice of @xmath47 is not unique .",
    "indeed , links are not determined by their complements , and there are infinitely many slopes on the boundary of a solid torus such that performing dehn filling along them gives the @xmath1-sphere ( see also remark  [ r : surgery ] ) .    note that if @xmath4 admits a semi - free symmetry , then either all powers of the symmetry that act as periods have the same fixed - point set or the union of their fixed - point sets consists of two circles forming a hopf link . in the first situation",
    "a hyperbolic link @xmath47 can be constructed as in the case of periodic knots . in the second situation",
    ", one can construct @xmath47 by choosing one of the two components of the hopf link , but @xmath47 will not be hyperbolic in general .",
