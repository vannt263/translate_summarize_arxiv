    "for @xmath3 , we consider a system of @xmath0 ( spinless ) fermions of mass @xmath2 , interacting with another particle of mass @xmath4 via point interactions .",
    "the latter are characterized by a parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is proportional to the scattering length of the pair interaction @xcite .",
    "purely formally , the hamiltonian of the system can be thought of as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represents an infinitesimal coupling constant .",
    "models of this kind have been studied extensively in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and can be defined via a suitable regularization procedure .",
    "due to translation invariance , it is convenient to separate the center - of - mass motion and to introduce relative coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 in the usual way . with their aid",
    "we can formally write the operator @xmath13 as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the latter operator acts on purely anti - symmetric functions of @xmath0 variables only .",
    "the formal expression can be given a meaning in terms of a suitable quadratic form @xcite , which will be introduced in the next section .",
    "however , only in case the quadratic form is stable , i.e. , bounded from below , does it give rise to a unique self - adjoint operator and hence gives a precise meaning to .",
    "we are interested in this question of stability .",
    "we shall show that there exists a critical mass @xmath1 , independent of @xmath0 , such that stability holds for @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is determined by a two dimensional optimization problem of a certain analytic function .",
    "a numerical evaluation of the expression yields @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the system under consideration is stable for @xmath20 .",
    "this latter case is of particular importance , in view of constructing a model of a gas of spin @xmath21 fermions in the unitary limit . for @xmath22 such fermions ,",
    "our result can be interpreted as proving the existence of such a model in the sector of total spin @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath2 less than the maximal value . of course stability holds trivially in the sector of total spin @xmath24 , since the particles do not interact in this case due to the total antisymmetry of the spatial part of the wave functions .",
    "we note that stability in other spin sectors is still an open problem , whose solution would be of great interest in view of the relevance of the model for cold atomic gases ( see @xcite and references there ) . for its solution ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the problem of stability for general systems of @xmath25 particles mutually interacting via point interactions . in the case",
    "@xmath26 ( and @xmath20 ) , a numerical analysis @xcite suggests stability .",

    ", we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 we introduced @xmath36 for short , and the function @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 one readily checks that both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are actually independent of @xmath41 for @xmath28 , even though @xmath42 and @xmath43 depend on @xmath41 .    the quadratic form @xmath27 can be obtained as limit of a suitably regularized version of , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "we note that follows immediately from in combination with the simple estimate @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , one simply chooses @xmath57 , using the independence of @xmath40 of @xmath41 .",
    "it is also not difficult to see that for @xmath53 , @xmath58 is closed ( compare with ( * ? ? ? * thm .  2.1 ) ) , and thus gives rise to a unique self - adjoint operator .",
    "the lower bound is sharp as @xmath59 . for @xmath56",
    ", @xmath60 equals the binding energy of the two - particle problem with point interactions . as @xmath59 ,",
    "only one of the fermions can be bound , hence the ground state energy becomes independent of @xmath0 in that limit .",
    "we emphasize that in contrast to the previous work @xcite we prove a bound on the critical mass that is independent of @xmath0 and , in particular , does not grow as @xmath0 gets large",

    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath78 where @xmath79 similarly , @xmath80 in particular , after a unitary translation by @xmath81 , the operator @xmath68 becomes the operator @xmath82 with integral kernel @xmath83    boundedness of @xmath82 was already shown in @xcite . for a simple proof , note that the cauchy - schwarz inequality implies that @xmath84 for any positive function @xmath85 .",
    "choosing @xmath86 for @xmath87 one easily checks that the right side of ( [ rss ] ) is finite ( and , in fact , independent of @xmath88 ) .",
    "let @xmath89 denote the reflection operator @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the operators @xmath89 and @xmath82 clearly commute .",
    "moreover , the product @xmath92 is easily seen to be positive definite , by writing @xmath93 noting that @xmath94 and that the gaussian has a positive fourier transform .",

    "we introduce @xmath102 for @xmath103 , and rewrite the term on the right side of as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 , as well as @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . to bound this last expression , we use the schwarz inequality , as in , to obtain @xmath112 for any positive function @xmath85 .",

    "inserting the special structure , the expression on the right side of then equals @xmath113    we shall choose @xmath114 in .",
    "the resulting bound is then @xmath115 where we again use the notation @xmath116 , as in the proof of lemma  [ lem1 ] .",
    "since @xmath117 is symmetric under exchange of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , for any @xmath107 , we can drop the maximum over @xmath120 when taking the supremum over @xmath118 and @xmath121 , and simply take @xmath122 ( or any other value of @xmath120 , in fact ) .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath123    to complete the proof , we need to show that the term multiplying @xmath124 on the right side of is bounded by @xmath48 .",

    "the supremum is attained at @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and equals @xmath178 . in particular , it is less than @xmath2 .",
