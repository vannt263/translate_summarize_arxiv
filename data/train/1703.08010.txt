    "<S> the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variational approach with davydov _ anstze _ is a sophisticated , yet efficient technique to obtain an accurate solution to many - body schrdinger equations for energy and charge transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates and light - harvesting complexes . we extend this variational approach to finite temperatures dynamics of the spin - boson model by adopting a monte carlo importance sampling method . in order to demonstrate the applicability of this approach , we compare real - time quantum dynamics of the spin - boson model calculated with that from numerically exact iterative quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison shows that our variational approach with the single davydov _ </S>",
    "<S> anstze _ is in excellent agreement with the quapi method at high temperatures , while the two differ at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> accuracy in dynamics calculations employing a multitude of davydov trial states is found to improve substantially over the single davydov _ </S>",
    "<S> ansatz _ , especially at low temperatures . at a moderate computational cost , our variational approach with the multiple davydov _ </S>",
    "<S> ansatz _ is shown to provide accurate spin - boson dynamics over a wide range of temperatures and bath spectral densities . </S>"
