    "there is a well - known positive correlation between galaxy luminosity and metallicity @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured this relation for 53400 star - forming galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 , @xcite ) , estimating the gas phase oxygen abundance , @xmath3 , from region emission lines as the surrogate for `` metallicity . '' using estimates of the galaxy stellar masses derived from the techniques of @xcite , @xcite showed that metallicity is better correlated with galaxy mass than with luminosity , which suggests that the observed relation arises from the fact that lower mass galaxies have lower escape velocities than higher mass galaxies and so lose metals more easily via , e.g. , supernova winds @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that even if a low - mass galaxy can selectively remove its metals via winds , subsequent star formation can essentially erase the effects on the gas - phase metallicity ; both a low star formation rate and a large gas fraction are needed to retain low metal abundances .",
    "other proposed origins for the mass  metallicity relation include lower star formation rates in less massive galaxies giving rise to fewer massive stars and therefore less metal production @xcite .    despite the locus of galaxies in the mass  metallicity plane having intrinsically high scatter ( e.g. , a 1-@xmath4 spread of @xmath5  dex in @xmath3  at @xmath6 ) , in the absence of good quality spectra",
    "it has become an increasingly common practice to deduce or assign metallicities to galaxies based simply on their luminosities . in particular , the idea persists that dwarf galaxies are always `` metal - poor , '' certainly a fair assumption in the local group . in this study however , we will show that there is a significant population of low - mass galaxies with high gas - phase oxygen abundances relative to the mass  metallicity relation defined by @xcite ; high - mass low - metallicity outliers from the mass  metallicity relation will be the focus of an upcoming paper . as shown in figure  [ fig : ohmb ]",
    ", we find 24 galaxies with @xmath7  mag and @xmath8 and 17 high - metallicity outliers with @xmath9  mag .",
    "we explain how we selected this sample in  [ sec : outliers ] and verified the galaxies high oxygen abundances in  [ sec : metal ] . in  [ sec : disc ] we discuss some of the possible explanations for the existence of such a population of galaxies and explain why we predict that these galaxies should have relatively low gas masses .",
    "specifically , in  [ sec : trans ] we discuss the evidence for our galaxies being so - called `` transition '' dwarf galaxies .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we began with the sample of @xmath10 star - forming galaxies with measured gas - phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses from @xcite .",
    "high - metallicity outliers from the mass  metallicity locus can be due to main three causes , and our cuts were taken with these in mind .",
    "first , some galaxies can spuriously appear to be underluminous for their mass .",
    "examples include highly inclined galaxies subject to strong internal extinction and regions in larger galaxies that sdss has mistakenly flagged as a galaxy .",
    "among relatively nearby galaxies ( e.g. , those in the virgo cluster ) some have large peculiar velocities relative to the hubble flow , leading to a misestimation of their distance modulus and thus absolute magnitude .",
    "secondly , rogue outliers can have spuriously high estimated metallicities ; the galaxy , for example , may not be at high enough redshift to have the strongly constraining [ ] @xmath11  emission line in the sdss bandpass .",
    "also , the strengths of the [ ] and [ ] lines paradoxically _ decrease _ with oxygen abundance , so at low signal - to - noise , the metallicity can be overestimated due to underestimated line fluxes . finally , the object can be an honest outlier ; these are the objects we want in our final sample .",
    "we found that a large number of cuts in different parameter spaces is useful for automatically rejecting many objects which would otherwise have to be thrown out by visual inspection .",
    "we ran two searches on the full @xcite  sample for high - metallicity outliers .",
    "for the first , we were very conservative with our cuts so as to be certain that the remaining galaxies are both statistically significant and not spurious .",
    "however , due to significant contamination at low luminosities , this `` main '' sample has no members with @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore did a separate , less stringent search for the lowest luminosity outliers ; to distinguish it from the main sample , we refer to this sample of lower mass galaxies as the `` very low mass '' sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : ohmb ] shows where our sample falls in the @xmath3@xmath13 plane ; all galaxy images are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] and summary information is presented in table  [ tbl : sample ] . for reference , in figure",
    "[ fig : ohmb ] we plot the small and large magellanic clouds and milky way using @xmath13 from @xcite .",
    "we recalculated @xmath3  for the smc and lmc using the line ratios reported by @xcite of six regions in the smc and four regions in the lmc and the relation @xmath14 , where @xmath15\\lambda6584/\\mbox{h}\\alpha)$ ] @xcite .",
    "we then transformed these abundances onto the @xcite scale using the formulae given by @xcite , resulting in average metallicities of 8.21 and 8.39 for the smc and lmc , respectively .",
    "the milky way is plotted also plotted for reference at the solar oxygen abundance of 8.86 @xcite .",

    "spiral galaxies are known to have radial metallicity gradients such that the nuclear abundances are higher than averages over whole galaxies .",
    "thus , if only a small fraction of the galaxy is within the sdss spectroscopic @xmath99  diameter fibers , the measured metallicity can appear to be artificially high relative to other galaxies .",
    "following @xcite , we make an initial cut by requiring that the fraction of the galaxy covered by the fiber to be greater than 10% .",
    "( in our final cut , we follow @xcite and change this lower bound to 20% , which only eliminates two of the galaxies contained in the penultimate sample listed in table  [ tbl : cuts ] . )",
    "we wanted the sample to be statistically significant , so outliers were then determined via a series of cuts in the @xmath3  versus absolute @xmath100-band magnitude ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath101-band ( @xmath102 ) , and stellar mass ( m@xmath103 ) planes , as demonstrated with m@xmath103 in figure  [ fig : cuts ] . for example , we divided the 52477 objects with sdss magnitude errors @xmath104  mag in all bands into bins of @xmath13 of width @xmath105  mag ; in each bin we kept the 2.5% with the highest @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath102 was calculated from the sdss @xmath101-band magnitude and the spectroscopic redshift , @xmath13 was calculated using the low - resolution spectral templates of @xcite , and the stellar masses from the @xcite  sample were measured using a combination of sdss colors and spectra as described by @xcite .",
    "only 58 objects survived this series of cuts .    at this point",
    ", we made a redshift cut : galaxies must have @xmath109 in order to have the [ ]  @xmath110  emission line pair in their sdss spectrum , and as this is a highly constraining line for the metallicity , we determined that it should be in the spectrum in order to remove a possible source of systematics and so that we can measure the metallicity with a diagnostic that uses this line .",
    "seven @xmath111 galaxies pass our subsequent @xmath3  error and visual inspection cuts ; after studying their spectra , as discussed below , we chose to keep these galaxies in our main sample .",
    "we also forced the cited @xmath112 error in @xmath3  to be less than 0.05  dex ; metallicities with large uncertainties are obviously more likely to be spurious than ones with small uncertainties .",
    "unsurprisingly , the @xmath113 redshift cut ( after all of the other cuts ) also removed any galaxies with fiber fractions @xmath114 which would have survived to that stage .",
    "we find , however , that this large number of cuts in various parameter spaces dramatically reduced the number of objects that had to be removed `` by eye . ''",
    "the final visual - inspection cut removed only two objects with nearby potential photometric contaminations .",
    "finally , we re - examined the fiber fraction cut ; following @xcite we allowed the lower - limit fiber fraction to be 20% ( excluding two objects from the sample ) .",

    "we therefore did a separate search for high - metallicity galaxies at extremely low luminosities and masses , as summarized in table  [ tbl : lowmcuts ] .",
    "we chose to not apply a fiber fraction cut for this sample because lower luminosity galaxies are preferentially closer and therefore subtend a larger angle on the sky , making it more difficult for a substantial fraction of the galaxy to be within the 3  sdss fiber diameter .",
    "we therefore began the selection with a magnitude error cut , like the one for the main sample .",
    "we also removed objects with fiber fractions @xmath126 occupying the parameter space already excluded by the main sample : any objects with @xmath13 brighter than @xmath127  mag , @xmath128 , and a high @xmath129  at the 95% level with respect to m@xmath103 were excluded .",
    "the cuts in @xmath3  relative to @xmath13 , @xmath102 and m@xmath103 are all less stringent than for the main sample , but because for this sample we are interested in the _ very _ low mass objects , we took a strong ( 99% level ) cut in m@xmath103 relative to @xmath3 .",

    "we note that there are several complications with measuring high metallicities using visible wavelength spectra ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "the main problem is that cooling is more efficient at high metallicities , which translates into lower nebular temperatures and hence weaker [ ] and [ ] visible - wavelength lines , with the primary cooling load shifting to the far - infrared fine structure emission lines that can not be readily observed .",
    "the result is that at high abundances the visible wavelength spectra become increasingly insensitive to changes in @xmath129 .",
    "in fact , some diagnostics , like the traditional r@xmath138 line index , effectively saturate at high metallicity @xcite , making it rather difficult to accurately measure even relative abundances . because we would like to verify the high estimated oxygen abundances and we can not reproduce the @xcite abundance calculations , which are based on a bayesian statistical method , we measured @xmath129  in our galaxies using two recommended methods from @xcite .",
    "another possible source of systematic inaccuracy in the abundance estimates is the treatment of extinction corrections .",
    "the corrections traditionally applied use the balmer decrement and assume a simple uniform foreground obscuring screen model like that used for stars to estimate @xmath139 and correct the other emission lines .",
    "it is expected , however , that extinction towards extended sources like regions is better described as a clumpy screen , for example the turbulent screen models of @xcite . in these , use of a simple screen tends to systematically _ overestimate _ the extinction correction for the @xmath1403727,29  emission line , leading to a systematic _ underestimate _ of the gas - phase oxygen abundance . in all of our galaxies",
    "the balmer decrement measurements are consistent with low @xmath139 ( @xmath141 ) for a simple screen extinction model , so this is not a big effect compared to other sources of measurement error given the attenuation curves in @xcite .",

    "in particular , while the seventeen @xmath109 galaxies in our main sample span @xmath145  dex on the @xcite scale , they span @xmath146  dex when their metallicities are calculated using the r@xmath138 methods of either @xcite or @xcite , reflecting the fact that the r@xmath138 parameter essentially saturates at high oxygen abundances @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundances for our 41 galaxies plotted against these adopted metallicities in figure  [ fig : convz ] .",
    "the dotted line indicates equal measurements ; the other two lines are the empirically determined relations from @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in our sample fall preferentially above the relation for the @xcite method , but surprisingly those galaxies for which it is measurable fall _ below _ the relation for the @xcite method .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that because [ ] and [ ] are widely separated in wavelength , a misestimation of the extinction or a poorly fitted continuum ( especially for the weak [ ] emission line ) can lead to underestimated abundances .",
    "specifically , there is often a degeneracy when fitting the stellar continuum between the extinction and the stellar population .",
    "while the continuum fitting for our spectra are fairly good ( i.e. , they exhibit low residuals after the stellar template is subtracted ) , we tested the sensitivity to the continuum level at [ ] @xmath147by calculating the @xcite  metallicity when the continuum is over- and underestimated ; the mean of these two extreme metallicities is still systematically larger than expected by the mean relation , implying that the shift is not due to continuum fitting error .",
    "we quantify the differences between the @xcite and @xcite methods by examining the product of the vertical displacement of each galaxy ( for an optimally fit continuum ) from the two @xcite  relations ; only one galaxy in the main sample has a significantly high @xcite metallicity relative to both of the other indicators .",
    "however , this @xmath3  was still high enough that even when the @xcite  metallicity was replaced with the one expected from either relation , the galaxy still passes the cuts in both the @xmath102- and m@xmath103-metallicity planes . while the @xmath148 galaxies do not have measurable [ ] ( and hence we can not use the @xcite  diagnostic for them ) , the low redshift sample occupies a similar part of the @xcite  versus @xcite  parameter space as the galaxies in the main sample . for the very low - mass sample of galaxies , out of the 22 galaxies which passed our visual inspection test , we excluded 6 because they were more than @xmath149  dex above the @xcite  relation from @xcite ; this is actually a more stringent cut than used for the main sample because several of the galaxies in the main sample with @xmath134  dex deviations from the @xcite  relation have compensating negative deviations relative to the @xcite  scale .",
    "we interpret these results to mean that the 41 galaxies we have identified are true high - metallicity low - mass outliers from the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "the 41 dwarf galaxies selected as described in  [ sec : outliers ] are surprisingly non - pathological .",
    "they have undisturbed stellar morphologies ( see figure  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "furthermore , given that by selection these galaxies have both low luminosities and high metallicities and that there is a trend for redder , brighter galaxies to have higher oxygen abundances ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) these metal - rich dwarfs do not occupy unexpected region of the color  magnitude diagram ( see figure  [ fig : cmd ] and also  [ sec : trans ] ) .",
    "how , then , did they come to have such high oxygen abundances ?",
    "one obvious possibility is that these metallicities are due to an environmental effect , but as we describe in  [ sec : enviro ] , the galaxies in our sample are non - interacting and rather isolated . though several models predict that these galaxies should have high specific star formation rates , we show in  [ sec : sfr ] , that these galaxies have normal star formation rates for their masses .",
    "we explain in  [ sec : gasfrac ] why we predict that these metal - rich dwarf galaxies should have relatively low gas fractions , and we discuss the implications of this prediction in the broader context of transition - type dwarf galaxies in  [ sec : trans ] .",
    "while the origin of scatter in the mass  metallicity relation is unknown , one popular proposal is that environment affects metallicity .",
    "recently , @xcite studied close pairs of star - forming galaxies in sdss with projected separations of @xmath150kpc and radial velocity separations of @xmath151kms@xmath152 .",
    "their results indicate that for minor mergers , the less massive galaxy is likely to be preferentially more metal rich than predicted by the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "likewise , @xcite , after accounting for correlations within the color  magnitude diagram , find a strong positive correlation between metallicity and overdensity for @xmath153 sdss - selected star - forming galaxies that can account for up to @xmath154% of the scatter in the mass  metallicity relation . in light of these results , we searched for nearby neighbors of the seventeen @xmath109 main sample metal - rich dwarf galaxies in a cylindrical volume of depth @xmath155kms@xmath152 and projected radius of 1  mpc .",
    "we find that our galaxies are relatively isolated ; none of them would have made it into the @xcite sample .",
    "seven out of these seventeen galaxies in our sample have no neighbors within this volume . of the 10 remaining galaxies , four have no neighbors within 500kms@xmath152 and 500kpc , and only two have any neighbors within 500kms@xmath152 and 100kpc .",
    "one of these two seems to be on the outskirts of a nearby cluster , but it is unclear whether or not it is physically associated with the cluster ( and there is only one small , faint , non - star - forming galaxy within the @xcite  volume ) .",
    "the other galaxy with a nearby neighbor is @xmath156kms@xmath152 and 85kpc from a less - massive relatively metal - poor ( @xmath157 \\approx 8.6 $ ] ) star - forming galaxy .",
    "we therefore conclude that interactions with neighbors do not explain the observed high abundances of our main sample of @xmath158 galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in the very low mass sample ( as well the @xmath123 galaxies in the main sample ) , however , are generally at low enough redshift that an automated search for neighbors in velocity and projected distance space is difficult . like the galaxies in the main sample , none of the lower - mass galaxies are in obviously interacting systems .",
    "only one has an clear companion ; it is a @xmath159 galaxy which appears to be a satellite of a non - starforming companion 33kpc and @xmath160kms@xmath152 away .",
    "also , while two of the seventeen galaxies in the very low mass sample may be in the virgo cluster , clearly a rich environment can not explain the high oxygen abundances observed in all of these galaxies .",
    "@xcite finds that for a galaxy to have a low metallicity , it must have both a low star formation rate and a high gas fraction ; she argues that the observed low star formation efficiency in galaxies with circular velocities @xmath161kms@xmath152 can explain the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite similarly suggest that the mass  metallicity relation could be due to a mass ",
    "star  formation rate relation : a galaxy with a lower rate of star formation will have relatively fewer massive stars , and therefore a lower oxygen abundance . in either of these scenarios",
    ", we might expect the mass  metallicity outliers to have high star formation rates for their masses .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find that at low stellar masses , galaxies with higher specific star formation rates tend to have _ lower _ oxygen abundances . as figure  [ fig : sfrm ] shows , the galaxies in the main sample do not have preferentially high or low instantaneous specific star formation rates , while typical star formation rates for the the very low mass sample galaxies are @xmath162dex _ lower _ than expected given their masses .",
    "so why do these galaxies have such high oxygen abundances ?",
    "consider a closed box star forming system ( i.e. , a system with no gas inflow or outflow ) .",
    "the metallicity @xmath163(mass of metals in gas phase)/(total gas mass ) is @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the gas fraction and @xmath166(mass of metals in gas)/(mass of metals in stellar remnants and main sequence stars ) is the metal yield .",
    "an immediately striking aspect of equation  [ eqn : closedbox ] is that there is no implicit dependence on the total galaxy mass ; the deviations from a universal metallicity in equation  [ eqn : closedbox ] is _ not _ the same as @xmath3it is a mass ratio of _ all _ metals rather than the abundance ratio of one element relative to hydrogen  the same arguments still qualitatively hold for observed abundances .",
    "] observed via the mass  metallicity relation are presumably then due to the fact that galaxies are not scaled closed box versions of one another : variations of the yield with mass , a dependence on the gas fraction with mass , or a combination of these effects plays a role . for a galaxy to have a higher metallicity than other galaxies of the same mass , equation  [ eqn : closedbox ]",
    "tells us that it must have either a relatively high yield or a relatively low gas fraction .",
    "observationally , the yield  which depends on both star formation physics as well as gas inflow and outflow  is a difficult quantity to measure ; one popular way to address this problem is to define an effective yield , @xmath167,\\ ] ] as the yield the galaxy _ would _ have were it actually a closed system .",
    "given the galaxy s metallicity and gas fraction , one can then easily calculate @xmath168 .",
    "a common explanation for the mass  metallicity relation is that the effective yield is positively correlated with galaxy mass , so that lower mass galaxies are able to preferentially lose metals to the intergalactic medium via winds because of their relatively shallow potential wells ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite tested this idea by comparing effective yields and baryonic masses .",
    "however , because when estimating the effective yield from equation  [ eqn : yeff ] , @xcite  use the measured @xmath3  values , outliers in the mass  metallicity relation are practically guaranteed to be outliers in the effective yield ",
    "baryonic mass relation .",
    "regardless , it is obvious from equation  [ eqn : closedbox ] that our metal - rich dwarfs must either have unusually high yields or unusually low gas fractions for their masses .",
    "galaxy yields can be affected by three processes : star formation , metal - deficient gas inflows , and metal - rich gas outflows .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sfrm ] and discussed in  [ sec : sfr ] , we find that the star formation rates for this population of galaxies are consistent with those of other galaxies of similar masses .",
    "@xcite has shown that metal - poor gas inflow is insufficient to explain the typically low metal abundances of low - mass galaxies ; we therefore conclude that a lower inflow rate is insufficient to explain the higher abundances of our galaxies .",
    "it is possible that these galaxies are less effective at driving outflows than other dwarfs .",
    "for example , @xcite find that , at fixed mass , galaxies with smaller half - light radii tend to have higher abundances ; this picture is consistent with the idea that it is more difficult to drive winds from deeper potential wells .",
    "( @xcite , on the other hand , find no correlation with how concentrated a galaxy s light is and its oxygen abundance . ) while the galaxies in our main sample do tend to have small radii for their masses ( half - light radii of less than 2kpc ) , the typical @xmath3  for galaxies of similar masses and radii is still @xmath162dex lower ( about @xmath169 ) than that of our galaxies . furthermore , the very low mass sample galaxies do not have preferentially small radii for their masses , leading us to conclude that while small radii may be a contributing factor to why some of these galaxies have been able to retain their metals , size alone does not tell the whole story .",
    "@xcite calculated that enriched gas outflows can only severely decrease a galaxy s effective yield if the gas fraction is sufficiently high ; that is , for low gas fractions , even a very strong outflow can not drastically decrease the effective yield  and thus measured abundance .",
    "likewise , if a galaxy has a relatively low gas fraction , then only a small amount of pollution is needed to enrich the gas and cause the measured abundance to be high .",
    "we therefore predict that these mass  metallicity outliers have anomalously low gas masses relative to other isolated galaxies of similar luminosities and star - formation rates .",
    "there are unfortunately no data in the literature for our galaxies that we can call upon to lend observational support to this prediction .",
    "however , @xcite have found that , in a sample of 27 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies , the gas - phase oxygen abundance is negatively correlated with the -measured gas - to - stellar mass ratio , which lends observational credence to our expectation .",
    "if these high - metallicity dwarf galaxies really do have relatively little gas , then they should be rapidly approaching the end of their star formation .",
    "specifically , these galaxies are likely to be transitioning from gas - rich dwarf irregulars ( dirr ) to gas - deficient dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) or the more massive dwarf ellipticals ( de ) . in general , so - called dirr / dsph transitional dwarfs have similar star - formation histories as their currently non - starforming dsph cousins : both galaxy types typically have a mix of old and intermediate - age stellar populations @xcite . in a study of five nearby star - forming transitional dwarfs",
    ", @xcite found that these relatively isolated galaxies seem to have unusually high oxygen abundances for their luminosities , much like our sample of mass  metallicity outliers . ) , highlighting the point that while our sample is rather pure , it is almost certainly incomplete . ]",
    "@xcite stress that the only difference between dsph galaxies and the transitional dirr / dsph galaxies is the absence of star formation and of gas in dsph galaxies .",
    "while much of this conclusion is based on galaxies in higher - density environments than ours are ( i.e. , the @xcite dwarf galaxies are mostly in the local group ) , we find it likely that our galaxies are part of a similar transition population : morphologically , they have smooth , undisturbed profiles ( see figure  [ fig : images ] ) , indicating a stronger relationship to dwarf spheroidals than to the dwarf irregulars .",
    "in particular , for all of our galaxies we note a lack of the irregular flocculent structures or spiral features often associated with dirr galaxies .",
    "in fact , the only remarkable morphology any of the galaxies in our sample displays are the bright  and often very blue  cores noticed in ten of the galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : blue ] and noted in table  [ tbl : sample ] . some of these cores appear to have merely much higher surface brightnesses than their surroundings , but some are decidedly blue : @xcite measure a difference of @xmath170  mag  arcsec@xmath171 from the center of ic  225 , ic  255 did not pass all of the cuts for our very low mass sample , and so we reinserted it into the sample by hand . ]",
    "relative to isophotes at @xmath172 .",
    "these bright cores are almost certainly not a signature of active galactic nuclei ; as mentioned in  [ sec : metal ] , these galaxies fall squarely within the star - forming locus of the normal bpt line - ratio diagnostic diagrams @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that for similar transitional dwarf galaxies with blue centers in the virgo cluster ( including vcc  1855 , the least massive galaxy in our sample with @xmath173\\sim 7.4 $ ] ) , star formation is limited to these central blue nuclei .",
    "( @xcite  attribute this centralized star formation to the effects of ram pressure stripping preferentially removing gas from the outer regions of the galaxies . however , not all of the galaxies in our sample with bright nuclei are in the kinds of rich environments like the virgo cluster where ram pressure stripping expected to play an important role . ) intriguingly ( yet unsurprisingly ) , most of our galaxies which appear to be approaching or on the red sequence ( see figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) also have bright and/or blue cores , implying that their colors are already dominated by their non - starforming regions . furthermore",
    ", having star formation limited to a relatively small region of the galaxy supports the idea that there is relatively little fuel available for forming stars , and thus that these galaxies are on their way to becoming standard dwarf spheroidal or dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have identified a sample of 41 low - luminosity high  oxygen abundance outliers from the mass  metallicity relation .    1 .",
    "these galaxies are fairly isolated and none show any signs of morphological disturbance .",
    "it is likely , however , that the handful of galaxies in this sample which are possible group or cluster members have disturbed _ gas _ morphologies , due to e.g. , ram - pressure stripping .",
    "however , environmental effects can not account for the large gas - phase oxygen abundances observed in all of these galaxies .",
    "2 .   based on the effective yield considerations of @xcite and various related observational results @xcite",
    ", we predict that these galaxies should have low gas fractions relative to other dwarf galaxies of similar stellar masses and star formation rates in similar environments but with more typical ( i.e. , lower ) oxygen abundances .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario , the _ stellar _ metallicities should be consistent with that of other dwarfs of similar luminosity , i.e. , the stellar metallicities should be lower than the measured gas - phase abundances .",
    "3 .   these mass  metallicity outliers appear to be `` transitional '' dwarf galaxies : because they are running out of star - forming fuel , they are nearing the end of their star formation and becoming typical isolated dwarf spheroidals .",
    "this conclusion is most sound for the @xmath174 galaxies which are observed to have low specific star formation rates .",
    "more data  specifically , gas fractions and stellar metallicities  are needed to help elucidate the situation for the higher mass galaxies .",
