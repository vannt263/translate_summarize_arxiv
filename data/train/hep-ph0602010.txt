    "the possibility that excited hadrons occur in nearly degenerate pairs of opposite parity  a phenomenon known as parity doubling  has been considered from time to time since the 1960 s .",
    "early arguments were based on regge theory  @xcite .",
    "there have been speculations that dynamical symmetries , not appearing in the underlying qcd lagrangian , might be responsible for this phenomenon@xcite .",
    "most recently it has been suggested that parity doubling can be explained by `` restoration '' of the underlying @xmath3 chiral symmetry of qcd at high energies @xcite and/or in specific sectors of the spectrum@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed analysis , both phenomenological and theoretical , of parity doubling among the baryons made of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 quarks .",
    "we do not consider mesons here because there is less data and more controversy .",
    "given a concordance on meson resonances , our methods could easily be applied .",
    "we address three questions : first , what is the experimental evidence for parity doubling ?",
    "second , could a symmetry of the underlying qcd lagrangian be responsible for parity doubling ? and third ,",
    "even if the origins of parity doubling lie elsewhere , @xmath1 is of fundamental importance for qcd , and is widely discussed in connection with spectroscopy .",
    "what , if any , are its implications for the classification of hadrons ? on the first question , we find significant evidence for parity doubling among non - strange baryons ( nucleons and @xmath7s ) , but only weak evidence among hyperons ( @xmath8s and @xmath9s ) with strangeness ( @xmath10 ) minus one .",
    "there is not enough data to carry out an analysis for @xmath11s ( @xmath12 ) or @xmath13s ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "better information on the existence and classification of baryon resonances would help significantly here .",
    "turning to the possible origins of parity doubling , the most elegant explanations proposed make use of the fundamental symmetries of the qcd lagrangian : chiral @xmath15 and the singlet axial symmetry @xmath16 .",
    "any underlying symmetry behind parity doubling must involve charges that transform as pseudoscalars , since the multiplets involve states of opposite parity .",
    "the natural candidates are the charges of the isospin axial currents , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and the flavor singlet axial charge , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath0 connects states of opposite parity , but the same flavor and spin .",
    "@xmath1 charges change both parity and isospin , so multiplets in general contain states of opposite parity and different isospin .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration has been proposed as a mechanism for parity doubling for high excitations in the baryons spectrum @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was given the name `` effective chiral restoration '' , which we also use in the following for ease of comparison with the literature .",
    "it is equivalent to realizing chiral symmetry linearly on the excited states . as we pointed out in a recent paper  @xcite , @xmath1 chiral symmetry , when applied to the effective lagrangian describing the interactions of excited baryons and matter ,",
    "does not , by itself , lead to parity doubling .",
    "one can write down what appear to be wigner - weyl representations , where hadrons of equal mass and opposite parity transform into one another under the action of the @xmath20 axial charges .",
    "however @xmath1 _ invariant _ operators that couple the would - be parity doublets to pions can be added to the effective lagrangian describing these particles .",
    "these operators have the effect of removing the degeneracy of the previously degenerate states and spoiling any relationship between their axial charges .",
    "non - linear field redefinitions make the situation clear ( and do not change the physics ) : the only irreducible representations are multiplets of definite isospin and parity that transform according to the non - linear realization  @xcite . to obtain degenerate pairs of opposite parity ( and",
    "hence to achieve parity doubling ) it is necessary to suppress the families of @xmath1 _ invariant _ pion couplings that split them .",
    "the existence of these operators and the need to suppress them dynamically has not been systematically examined in work on effective chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different approach is taken in refs .",
    "@xcite , where hadrons are assigned to specific representations of @xmath1 in the context of a linear sigma model .",
    "chiral symmetry is subsequently broken when the sigma field takes a vacuum expectation value . by assigning hadrons to minimal ( though not irreducible ) @xmath1 representations , and allowing only low dimension operators in the linear sigma model lagrangian , a phenomenological framework for describing baryon resonances is constructed . in some examples , refs .",
    "@xcite take parity doubling as an input when they choose representations and interactions .",
    "in fact the example we discuss at length in sec .",
    "iii was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a `` mirror '' model of opposite parity baryons .",
    "because refs .",
    "@xcite do not attempt either to marshall evidence for parity doubling in the data or explain it in terms of some more fundamental dynamics , we do not discuss them further here .",
    "if `` effective chiral symmetry restoration '' is responsible for parity doubling , then states , to the extent they are parity doubled , must decouple from pions .",
    "this prediction can be tested experimentally .",
    "furthermore , only the simplest @xmath3 multiplets involve only parity doubled pairs of states .",
    "generic representations include states of different isospin as well as parity , which should be characteristic of this mechanism for parity doubling .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 symmetry of qcd is broken explicitly by a term in the quantum action induced by instantons @xcite and , of course , by quark masses .",
    "thus , its generator , @xmath21 , the associated singlet axial charge , does not commute with the qcd hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "it is also not a symmetry of the qcd vacuum , since , as coleman showed long ago@xcite , a charge that does not commute with the hamiltonian can not annihilate the vacuum . thus @xmath22 .",
    "note , however , that this _ does not _",
    "mean that @xmath0 is `` spontaneously broken '' .",
    "in a theory like qcd with a non - perturbative @xmath23 condensate in addition to instantons and quark masses , the question of whether a chiral symmetry is explicitly or spontaneously broken is _",
    "a matter of degree_. at one extreme , for zero up and down quark mass , @xmath1 is clearly spontaneously broken .",
    "as an example of the other extreme , consider qed : since @xmath24 , the axial @xmath0 associated with the current @xmath25 is not a symmetry of qed .",
    "its charge does not commute with the hamiltonian and does not annihilate the vacuum .",
    "in fact one can compute the @xmath26 condensate in perturbation theory . specifically , in the @xmath27 scheme this is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the renormalization point @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath32 , we say this symmetry is _ explicitly broken_. in qcd with three colors , the importance of _ explicit _ @xmath0 symmetry violation can be gauged by the magnitude of the @xmath33 mass , which comes entirely from explicit symmetry violation and is much greater than the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath34 . therefore , as discussed by t hooft@xcite , @xmath0 behaves like an explicitly broken symmetry .",
    "this is one place where it is _ not _ useful to take the large @xmath2 limit in qcd .",
    "there the situation becomes reverses because the source of explicit @xmath0 symmetry violation disappears and the @xmath33 becomes a ninth pseudoscalar goldstone boson ( when @xmath35 ) . in that limit the @xmath0 symmetry",
    "should be regarded as spontaneously broken .",
    "however , we live in a world with @xmath36 and explicit breaking of @xmath0 dominates .    like any _ explicitly broken _ symmetry ,",
    "if the matrix elements _ that violate @xmath0 symmetry _ are small in a sector of the spectrum , some of its consequences will follow . in the case at hand",
    ", parity doubling will be seen in a sector of the spectrum if the matrix elements of the divergence of the flavor singlet axial current are dynamically suppressed in that sector @xcite .",
    "other consequences of the symmetry are not obtained : for example the parity doubled states do not necessarily form representations of @xmath0 . for the sake of clarity , we refer to this phenomenon as `` dynamical suppression of @xmath0 symmetry violation '' rather than `` @xmath0 symmetry restoration .",
    "'' violation would be less likely among strange baryons .",
    "we no longer believe this to be required .",
    "we thank a.  manohar for discussions on this point . ]    to summarize , either chiral symmetry or @xmath16 could be responsible for parity doubling . in both cases extra dynamical mechanisms",
    "must be at work . for @xmath1 , _ chirally invariant _",
    "operators must be suppressed .",
    "if so , hadrons form chiral multiplets , not necessarily limited to parity doublets , and they decouple from pions .",
    "@xmath0 is more conventional : parity doubling can result if operators that _ violate the symmetry _ are suppressed .",
    "we also briefly explore some other proposed dynamical origins for parity doubling .",
    "we consider the possibility that parity doubling is not directly associated with a symmetry of the underlying lagrangian , but instead is a consequence of an intrinsic deformation of excited hadrons . if baryons can be accurately described as intrinsically deformed systems , if the intrinsic state spontaneously violates parity , and if the intrinsic state is rigid , _ i.e. _ the matrix element between the state and its parity image is small , then when collectively quantized , the spectrum would exhibit parity doubling .",
    "this is , in fact , an old idea@xcite , developed in early geometrical models of baryons .",
    "the arguments in support of this mechanism seem to apply best to states of high angular momentum , and there is evidence for parity doubling at high @xmath37 among non - strange baryons .",
    "however we also find strong evidence for parity doubling among baryons with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is hard to motivate from this point of view .",
    "we also discuss the arguments given by shifman  @xcite that the chiral invariance of perturbative qcd , valid at short distances , together with certain dynamical assumptions motivated by the @xmath40 ( @xmath2 is the number of colors in qcd ) limit , lead to parity doubling among mesons , and perhaps by extension , baryons .",
    "finally , although @xmath1 is in general not apparent in the spectrum , it is not devoid of implications for the spectrum of baryons .",
    "weinberg has shown that hadrons can be classified into multiplets under an @xmath1 symmetry where the axial generators are associated with pion - hadron vertices , provided hadron - hadron scattering amplitudes obey certain constraints at asymptotic energies @xcite .",
    "weinberg s `` mended ''",
    "chiral symmetry does not naturally lead to parity doubling , but it can accommodate it for special choices of the hadrons assignments into @xmath1 representations .",
    "we explore the possible spectroscopic consequences of chiral symmetry in the context of weinberg s work on `` mended symmetries '' , and comment on the relation of this approach to the contracted spin - flavor symmetry emerging in the large @xmath41 limit @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we examine the experimental situation . despite all the theoretical work , we know of no systematic attempt to quantify the evidence for parity doubling .",
    "typically papers on the subject include graphs or tables where the reader is invited to see some evidence for a correlation between states of opposite parity ( for a recent example , see ref .",
    "it is difficult , however , to factor in the ( often large ) widths of states and the fact that some states are much better established than others .",
    "also it is not clear which state to pair with which .",
    "some previous attempts to quantify the evidence for ( or against ) parity doubling can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we introduce a measure of the correlation between states of opposite parity , @xmath42 , that has some statistical basis . specifically , we test the hypothesis that two functions , positive and negative parity spectral densities for each isospin ( @xmath43 ) , strangeness ( @xmath10 ) , and spin ( @xmath37 ) , are identical within a tolerance @xmath44 , which measures the extent of symmetry breaking .",
    "we construct the spectral functions for each @xmath43 and @xmath37 from the baryons accepted by the particle data group  @xcite , including widths , and weighting resonances to reflect their reliability .",
    "we have no _ a priori _ standard with which to compare nature s value of @xmath42 .",
    "instead we construct a set of `` alternative realities '' by scrambling the parities of the known states . as an ensemble ,",
    "this set is free from correlations , so the comparison between @xmath42 computed over this ensemble with the value obtained from nature s assignment of parities gives a measure of the significance of the correlation .",
    "the method and our results are discussed in detail in section ii .    in section iii",
    "we look at the fundamental symmetries of qcd to see which , if any , could be responsible for the phenomenon of parity doubling .",
    "we review the realizations of chiral symmetry and briefly summarize the arguments of our recent paper @xcite on the way that massless goldstone bosons transforming non - linearly undermine the predictions of linearly realized chiral symmetry for baryon masses and couplings .",
    "we go on to state the conditions on the chiral effective lagrangian that must be satisfied in order to obtain parity doubling , irrespective of the underlying dynamical mechanism responsible for it .",
    "we describe the phenomenon of `` dynamical suppression of @xmath16 breaking '' , and show that it can lead to parity doubling in a sector of the hilbert space of qcd .",
    "we also summarize and review arguments for parity doubling from chiral symmetry restoration at short distances , and due to intrinsic hadron deformation . for completeness",
    "we summarize the spectroscopic predictions of weinberg s approach in section iv , where we introduce a new example that reproduces naturally some of the predictions of @xmath1 restoration , without fine tuning of the coefficients in the chiral lagrangian . finally in section",
    "v we summarize our results and discuss areas for further work .",
    "in this section we evaluate the experimental evidence for parity doubling among the baryons .",
    "we have chosen to study the baryons as listed by the particle data group@xcite .",
    "there is still much uncertainty concerning the spectrum of light ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) baryons and mesons , and other authors have chosen to study different data@xcite .",
    "we chose the pdg listings because they provide a critical summary of many experiments over many decades , and also because they treat baryon states uniformly , assigning masses , widths , and `` reliabilities '' using their famous `` star '' system .",
    "data on the meson spectrum accepted by the pdg is less complete , more controversial and lacks the reliability assignments .",
    "this point requires some discussion .",
    "the pdg has assigned reliabilities to 44 non - strange baryon resonances@xcite . for each angular momentum",
    "there are _ two _ isospin channels , @xmath45 ( nucleon ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the pdg non - strange meson listings are harder to interpret .",
    "the `` meson summary table '' lists ( coincidently ) 44 well - established non - strange mesons",
    ". however those states are distributed over _ four _ channels , @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "many more states appear in the full meson listings : 70 states can be found in the non - strange meson listings and another 96 ( ! ) can be found under the heading `` other light unflavored mesons '' .",
    "the latter list includes some that have been seen in only one experiment and some that other groups have claimed to exclude .",
    "recently , bugg@xcite has made an independent analysis of the meson spectrum including an attempt at assigning reliabilities , with results quite different from the pdg analysis .",
    "it would be very interesting to repeat our statistical analysis on a well - defined set of meson resonances .",
    "we find that there is reasonably strong evidence for parity doubling among the non - strange baryons ( @xmath45 nucleons and @xmath50s ) , and weaker , inconclusive evidence among the @xmath51 baryons ( @xmath52s and @xmath53s ) .",
    "there is not enough data on cascades ( @xmath12 ) or @xmath54s ( @xmath14 ) to perform our analysis .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ pointsnd ] , [ pointssl ] , [ deltatotal ] and [ sigmatotal ] , which should be consulted after an explanation of our method",
    ". it will be clear that the study of parity doubling is hampered by our incomplete knowledge of baryon resonances , especially those with strangeness .",
    "certainly a new experimental attack on hadron spectroscopy could greatly improve matters .",
    "despite many papers on the subject over many years , we know of no attempt to make a ( semi- ) quantitative evaluation of the evidence for parity doubling . typically authors simply show the spectrum of states with the same flavor and spin quantum numbers and opposite parity , and rely on the eye of the reader to recognize a propensity for states of opposite parity to cluster nearby in mass .",
    "such an `` eyeball '' approach has several shortcomings ,    * baryon resonances have large widths that are hard to display graphically . *",
    "different resonances have different statistical significance .",
    "overlap of two well established resonances should be given more weight than overlap of two doubtful states .",
    "* there is no reason to expect parity doubling to be an exact symmetry , so spectra must be compared with an allowance for symmetry breaking . * because of symmetry breaking and resonance widths , in channels with many states it is often not clear which states are to be compared .",
    "recently glozman and klempt@xcite have made more quantitative analyses , which however still suffer from some of the shortcomings listed above . in our analysis",
    "we will address all of these difficulties .",
    "we know of no way to obtain a rigorous measure of the significance of parity doubling in the physical spectrum , which perhaps explains the absence of work in this direction .",
    "however we do believe it is possible to improve on the eyeball . to do",
    "this one needs two ingredients : 1 ) a measure of how much correlation there is between negative and positive parity states ; and 2 ) a control set of `` alternative worlds '' on which the correlation can be measured and compared with our own",
    ".    a realistic approach to generating control spectra has to respect several features of the baryon resonance spectrum : a ) states are sparse at low mass , where there is no evidence for parity doubling ; b ) the data in each channel show roughly equal numbers of positive and negative parity states ; c ) reliabilities decrease and widths increase in general with resonance mass .",
    "reference spectra that ignore these features would not give fair comparisons with the real world .",
    "we do not know an algorithm that would generate _ a priori _ satisfactory comparison spectra free of these problems .",
    "instead we have chosen to use the physical spectrum itself to generate comparisons .",
    "specifically , in each channel of definite @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath10 , we keep the masses , widths , and reliabilities fixed , and reshuffle the the parities , keeping the number of positive and negative parity states fixed .",
    "this method generates comparison spectra which respect the characteristics listed in the previous paragraph , but which , as an ensemble , is free from any additional parity correlation beyond the desirable feature that the number of states of opposite parities is roughly equal in each channel . comparing the real world with these alternative realites tests whether the correlation between states of opposite parity in the real world beats a random ensemble with otherwise similar spectroscopic features .",
    "we consider `` channels '' of specific total angular momentum , @xmath37 , isospin , @xmath43 , and strangeness , @xmath10 . in each channel",
    "we define positive and negative parity spectral functions , @xmath55 , which we take to be a sum over normalized breit - wigner resonances with masses and widths taken from the pdg .",
    "specifically , we include only the states listed in the `` note on nucleon and @xmath7 resonances''@xcite .",
    "we weigh the resonances by a confidence factor , @xmath56 , proportional to the number of stars designated by the pdg , because we believe more weight should be given to correlations between well established states , @xmath57 the sum ranges over _ all _ states with a definite @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath10 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 resonances respectively .",
    "we have also performed the analysis with an exponential weighting , @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the effect on our results is negligible except for the @xmath8s ( @xmath48 , @xmath51 ) , where the shape of the distribution shifts significantly enough to warrant comment ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the factor @xmath64 assigns a parity to the @xmath65 state : @xmath66 for positive parity , and @xmath67 for negative parity .",
    "of course , nature prescribes a parity for each state as a set of @xmath64 s .",
    "notice that the @xmath68 are normalized , @xmath69 so the norm measures the number of states weighted by our confidence that they are real .",
    "we do not expect parity doubling to be an exact symmetry of qcd .",
    "instead we expect it to be approximately valid , parameterized by some symmetry breaking scale @xmath44 , which is expected to be of order ( say ) 50200 mev .",
    "our aim , then , is to test the hypothesis that the masses of positive and negative parity states are compatible within fluctuations with a variance @xmath44 .",
    "a simple indicator we can use to test the above hypothesis is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the complementary error function . @xmath72 and @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "( [ statistic ] ) then can be interpreted as follows . for a given @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the probability that a gaussian random number @xmath31 with average @xmath75 and variance @xmath44 gives a @xmath78 , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability that @xmath76 is closer to @xmath75 than a randomly generated number ( with variance @xmath44 ) .",
    "we can interpret @xmath44 as the order of magnitude of the breaking of the symmetry ( the argument is symmetric in @xmath79 ) .",
    "the possible values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are then distributed according to @xmath82 , normalized not to unity , but to @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 measures the correlation of the spectral functions with a `` forgiveness factor '' @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath54 is going to be larger in channels with more states , greater reliability , and , of course , better correlation between states of opposite parity . since @xmath85 the maximum possible value of @xmath86 occurs if the typical separations @xmath87 and widths @xmath88 are much smaller than the chosen @xmath44 . in that case",
    "we can set @xmath89 for all @xmath80 and @xmath81 and the two integrals decouple giving and @xmath90=n^{+}_{ijs}(\\{c\\})n^{-}_{ijs}(\\{c\\})$ ] .",
    "some other features of @xmath86 are worth noting : there is no penalty for the absence of parity doubling low in the spectrum .",
    "a state like the nucleon with no parity partner simply does not contribute .",
    "any overlapping states of opposite parity ( and the same @xmath91 ) contribute to @xmath86 .",
    "no choice of multiplet assignments is needed .",
    "the contribution of broad states is insensitive to shifts correlations on scales small compared to their widths .",
    "we do not know how to judge the _ a priori _ significance of the experimental value of @xmath86 because the underlying distributions @xmath68 are not normalized to unity , but instead weighted by the number and reliability in that channel  features that we regard to be important in the analysis .",
    "so we are led to check the value of @xmath54 realized in nature against an ensemble of control spectra generated by scrambling the parities among the otherwise fixed states for each @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the crucial feature of these control spectra is that the parities are reassigned randomly .",

    "such questions could be addressed for example using lattice qcd methods , as discussed recently in ref .",

    "we both evaluate the empirical evidence for parity doubling and consider some possible theoretical explanations .",

    "finally , the value of the overlap integral @xmath86 in the real world is compared against the statistical distribution on the ensemble , which assigns a probability measure ( @xmath331-value ) to the statement of parity doubling .",

    "larger spins the number of states decreases , and we do not expect the control samples to be representative statistically .",
    "still , there is good evidence for parity doubling among high spin , non - strange baryons as can be seen from table  [ table1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlations between positive and negative parity _ strange _ baryons are not significant .",
    "however , some of the states with strangeness expected in the quark model have not yet been seen , which could partly be responsible for the weaker correlations observed in these sectors .",
    "a new experimental attack on baryon spectroscopy could shed significant light on the systematics and origins of parity doubling .    in principle",
    "our statistical test could be used to search for more complex correlations , such as those expected in models of `` chiral symmetry restoration '' . in such schemes , additional degeneracies involving hadrons of different isospins",
    "( but the same spin ) are expected on top of parity doubling .",
    "the pattern of the mass spectrum in this case depends on the representation , @xmath333 , of @xmath15 assumed to be realized .",
    "for example , in the @xmath334 scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite one expects the baryons to be grouped into `` quartets '' of the form @xmath335 with the same spin @xmath37 .",

    "this would require higher dimensional integrals analogous to eq .",
    "( [ statistic ] ) . in any case",
    "no general correlations of this form are observed by eye .",
    "however , it is possible that more complicated chiral representations may not appear uniformly in the spectrum , but be localized in some mass region .",
    "this would render our method inapplicable , due to the sparseness of the corresponding control sample .",
    "we have examined a number of possible explanations of parity doubling .",
    "first we have tried to clarify the relationship between the usual @xmath1 chiral symmetry of qcd and parity doubling .",
    "the terminology used in the literature discussion has been confusing . in an important sense ( for massless @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks )",
    "@xmath1 is not broken at all , but instead represented in the nambu - goldstone form by massless pions and isospin multiplets of hadrons that transform non - linearly under chiral transformations .",
    "there is nothing to `` restore '' .",
    "instead , we frame the question as follows : `` what is needed in order that baryons fall into wigner - weyl representations of @xmath336with the usual degeneracies and relations among couplings '' ?",
    "the answer , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and reviewed here , is that a set of @xmath1 _ invariant _ operator matrix elements must be suppressed , basically amounting to decoupling the pion from the parity doublet states .",
    "if this decoupling were complete , it would , in effect , leave _ two independent _ @xmath1 symmetries : one under which the pion and non - parity - doubled states transform _ non - linearly _ , and the other under which the parity doubled states transform _ linearly_. a toy model of this type has recently been proposed by cohen and glozman  @xcite .",
    "the question is what dynamics are responsible for suppressing these operator matrix elements and giving rise to this additional symmetry ?",
    "if the dynamics behind effective chiral symmetry restoration applies generically to hadrons high in the spectrum , as advocated , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , then parity doubling should be universal in that domain",
    ". it would be puzzling if , for example , some ( _ e.g. _ ) highly excited mesons are parity doubled , but some are not .",
    "a search for such exceptions would be a particularly effective way to test this explanation of parity doubling .",
    "we emphasize that parity doubling alone is not conclusive evidence for effective chiral symmetry restoration . as discussed in sec .",
    "3a , chiral symmetry realized linearly on a set of baryons requires that pions decouple from the parity doubled states .",
    "in addition , one would have to check the validity of certain relations for axial couplings between the members of the putative chiral multiplet implied by the symmetry algebra implemented in the wigner - weyl mode .",
    "next we considered the possibility that parity doubling is a consequence of dynamical suppression of @xmath16 symmetry breaking in a subsector @xmath337 of the hilbert space of qcd .",
    "note that this is not equivalent to @xmath16 restoration , as realized for example in large @xmath41 qcd .",
    "for example , the effects of the anomaly are still present , and give the @xmath338 the masses observed in nature .",
    "rather , we require only that the matrix elements of the divergence of the axial singlet current are very small on a subset of baryon states @xmath339 , with @xmath340 .",
    "this condition is satisfied if the matrix elements of the gluon anomaly term taken between non - strange baryons of opposite parity are very small .",
    "the hypothesis that the matrix elements of @xmath341 are suppressed among excited baryons may be amenable to study using lattice qcd methods .",
    "although it predicts parity doublets , the mechanism of dynamical suppression of @xmath16 symmetry breaking does not make predictions for the pion couplings to the doublet states ( except that the pions must decouple from parity doubled states at zero momentum , as required by the goldberger - treiman relation ) .",
    "such relations would be obtained , for example , if we required the doublet to be left invariant under @xmath16 and parity transformations .",
    "in addition to suppression of @xmath0 symmetry violation , we review two other possible origins for parity doubling . first we examine arguments recently put forward that parity doubling in the spectrum can be related to chiral symmetry restoration at short distances , a phenomenon well grounded in perturbative qcd .",
    "the only input from short distance chiral symmetry is the superconvergence relation , eq .",
    "( [ super ] ) .",
    "the rest of the argument requires input from phenomenological models ( _ e.g. _ linear excitation spectra ) and large @xmath2 implemented in an unusual way  examining the large @xmath342 ( excitation ) limit , but taking @xmath343 first .",
    "@xmath344 corrections seem capable of invalidating the conclusions . in any event",
    "this exercise provides an example of the extent of additional dynamics required to obtain effective chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "finally we look at the possibility that parity doubling may be a consequence of an intrinsic deformed state that spontaneously violates parity . a mechanism familiar from nuclear and molecular physics ,",
    "this leads one to expect parity doubling at high spin for both strange and non - strange baryons , but gives little insight into why spin 1/2 and 3/2 nucleons and @xmath7s should show statistically significant evidence for the symmetry .    an alternative way of obtaining relations among masses and axial couplings which adds dynamical input in a minimal way is offered by the mended chiral symmetry approach of weinberg @xcite .",
    "in this approach the set of all pion couplings among baryon states @xmath225 ( in sectors of given helicity ) , together with the isospin operators @xmath113 , are shown to satisfy the @xmath1 algebra .",
    "however , input from regge theory shows that the mass operator is not a singlet under this symmetry , but contains in addition also a chiral 4-vector term .",
    "this implies that the hadrons transform in _",
    "reducible _ representations of the @xmath345 symmetry .",
    "models of hadrons can be constructed by postulating a representation content , and the corresponding mixing angles .",
    "even minimal models containing one or two such representations can reproduce the properties of the lowest lying baryons remarkably well @xcite .    as examples of this approach we presented two such models . first , to introduce the ideas we describe a model containing a @xmath346 degenerate pair of the same parity , which reproduces the quark model predictions for pion couplings .",
    "this model was previously considered in refs .",
    "the second model is new and contains two nucleons of opposite parity and spins @xmath38 .",
    "their masses and couplings are determined by just three mass parameters and one mixing angle among chiral representations .",
    "we show that , for a particular value of the mixing angle , the pion couplings to the parity doublet take precisely the same values as those expected if chiral symmetry were realized linearly on the two states , but without mass degeneracy in the spectrum .",
    "this illustrates a natural realization of such relations which does not require chiral symmetry restoration .",

    "<S> the parity doubled states should decouple from pions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss other explanations including connections to chiral invariant short distance physics motivated by large @xmath2 arguments as suggested by shifman and others , and intrinsic deformation of relatively rigid highly excited hadrons , leading to parity doubling on the leading regge trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> finally we review the spectroscopic consequences of chiral symmetry using a formalism introduced by weinberg , and use it to describe two baryons of opposite parity .     </S>",
