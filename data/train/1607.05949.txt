    "in the present paper , we present the foundations of the new mathematical model of thermodynamics for the values of the energy for which the molecules do not split into ions and are in the pre - plasma state .",
    "the new mathematical model constructed by the author in the cycle of papers @xcite@xcite , differs somewhat from the commonly accepted model of phenomenological thermodynamics ( see section  [ concl ] ) and allows us to construct the equation of state for a wider class of classical gases .",
    "we mainly study the metastable states in the case of gases and in the case of fluids up to the critical isochore @xmath0 .",
    "the liquid isotherms are divided into two parts : the region with temperatures near the critical temperature @xmath1 and the region of the `` hard '' liquid whose isotherms pass through the point of zero pressure .",
    "further , the distributions in the van - der - waals model are compared to the distributions appearing in the author s new model for classical gases with given critical temperatures , in particular , with van - der - waals critical temperature .",
    "the precision with which the isotherms constructed from the author s theory coincide with the van - der - waals isotherms turns out to be less than the accepted precision in experimental studies .",
    "the probability of such a coincidence being accidental is `` infinitely small '' .",
    "all the distributions of energy levels for classical gas considered in the present paper have been established mathematically , see  @xcite@xcite and references therein ) and have met with approval ( see , for example , the review  @xcite , published in the journal `` probability theory and its applications '' in connection with the state prize of the russian federation in science and technology granted to the author in 2013 ( for developing the mathematical foundations of modern thermodynamics ) .",
    "the correct choice of units of measurement for different gases allowed van - der - waals to compare the parameters of the gases to dimensionless quantities , thus obtaining the famous `` law of corresponding states '' .    for every gas",
    ", there exists a critical temperature @xmath1 and a critical pressure @xmath2 such that if the temperature or the pressure is greater than their critical values , then gas and liquid can no longer be distinguished .",
    "this state of matter is known as a fluid .",
    "the van - der - waals `` normalization '' consists in taking the ratio of the parameters by their critical value , so that we consider the reduced temperature @xmath3 and the reduced pressure@xmath4 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the diagrams of the state of various gases resemble each other ",
    "this a manifestation of the law of corresponding states .",
    "the equation of state for the van - der - waals gas in dimensionless variables has the form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the dimensionless concentration ( density ) @xmath8 is chosen so that @xmath9 in the critical point .    in thermodynamics ,",
    "the dimension of the internal energy @xmath10 is equal to the dimension of the product @xmath11 of the pressure by the volume . on the other hand",
    ", temperature plays the role of mean energy @xmath12 of the gas ( or of the liquid ) . for that reason , when the dimension of temperature is given in energy units , the parameter @xmath13 , known as the _ compressibility factor _",
    ", is dimensionless . for the equation of state of the gas or liquid , the most natural diagram is the @xmath14-@xmath15 diagram , in which the dimensionless pressure @xmath14 is plotted along the @xmath16-axis and the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 , along the @xmath17-axis .",

    "in the physics literature , the notion of number of degrees of freedom is used for ideal gases , in which particles do not interact . in probability , the number of degrees of freedom is also considered independently of any interaction .",
    "when physicists speak of the number of degrees of freedom , they usually have in mind the number of degrees of freedom of a single molecule .",
    "normally , a one - atom molecule will have 3 degrees of freedom , a two - atom molecule , 5 . in a gas ,",
    "the molecules move with different speeds and different energies ; although their mean energy  temperature  is the same , their individual energies may be different , and the number of degrees of freedom of different molecules can also differ .",
    "thus a two - atom molecule with very high energy may have a number of degrees of freedom greater than than 5 , and this will affect the mean value ( average over all molecules ) of the number of degrees of freedom of the given gas . this mean value is called the _ collective number of degrees of freedom _ of the gas , and is a fractional rather than a whole number .    a one - atom molecule has 3 degrees of freedom , a two - atom molecule , 5 .",
    "two - atom molecules are regarded in  @xcite as molecules of ideal gas .",
    "nevertheless , saying that the number of degrees of freedom of a molecule is 5 means that we are implementing an exclusion rule : we are saying that one of the degrees of freedom is excluded .",
    "more precisely , we regard the molecule as a dumbbell , and exclude its oscillations as a rod . however , if the temperature increases , these `` rod '' oscillations will take place and so , for sufficiently high temperatures ( energies ) , the molecules will have a greater fractional number of degrees of freedom .    in the author s model , the number of degrees of freedom is an important independent parameter , so that the notion of exclusion need not be defined by means of some internal considerations .",
    "although the collective number of degrees of freedom of a classical gas can be determined by the initial interaction between its particles , in the probabilistic description of the generalized ideal gas ( a notion that we present in section 5 ) , this parameter is introduced independently .",
    "if nuclear forces are taken into consideration , it can be shown that a wide class of two - atom molecules have 5 degrees of freedom , but this is difficult to establish .",
    "and so we prefer to stipulate axiomatically , as in probability theory , that on a given energy level there can be only one or , say , no more than @xmath23 particles .",
    "another important consideration is that we do not take into account the number of particles and the volume separately , we consider their ratio  density ( concentration ) .",
    "the consideration of density alone leads to the following important consequence in thermodynamics : density does not depend on the numeration of particles contained in the given volume .",
    "whatever the numeration of the particles , the density remains the same .",
    "it is commonly believed ( in particular , it is stated in the book  @xcite ) that classical particles differ from quantum particles in that they can be numbered and then the motion of any individual particle can be followed by keeping track of its number .",
    "this is correct , but if the behavior of a multi - particle system is described by equations involving density , e.g. via a probability distribution , then such a description does not depend on the numbering of particles .",
    "therefore , all the results from quantum mechanics that follow from the remarkable fact that the solution does not depend on numeration can be carried over to the description of any classical multi - particle system by means of equations containing density .",
    "the exclusions that we impose will lead us to a more general distribution in which we stipulate that no more than @xmath23 particles are on the same energy level .",
    "the natural number @xmath23 will be called the _ maximal occupation number _ or _",
    "maximal admissible size of clusters_.    the corresponding energy distribution , often called parastatistical  @xcite@xcite , will be described in the next section .    in the landau ",
    "lifshits textbook  @xcite , two relations are given as the basic equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy , @xmath26 is the number of particles and @xmath27 is a discrete family of energy levels ( see @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the values @xmath28 in equation   are related to the existing interaction potential for the particles .",
    "it turns out that if we use the interaction with collective number of degrees of freedom equal to @xmath29 , then we must put @xmath30 i.e. , @xmath31 this statement is a theorem proved in the author s paper  @xcite .",
    "in the simplest version of thermodynamics , one considers the conjugate extensive - intensive pairs pressure - volume , temperature - entropy , chemical potential - number of particles .",
    "one of the main notions of thermodynamics is the equation of state . in 6-dimensional phase space , where the intensive thermodynamical variables @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 , and @xmath34 play the role of coordinates and the corresponding extensive variables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath26 play the role of momenta , the equation of state is described by a 3-dimensional surface on which several additional identities , corresponding to the so - called thermodynamical potentials , hold .",
    "this results in the fact that this 3-dimensional surface is a lagrangian manifold , and the thermodynamical potential corresponds to action in mechanics .",
    "if one does not consider the number of particles and the volume separately , and only considers their ratio , i.e. , density , then one variable turns out to be redundant , and we can consider 4-dimensional phase space and the 2-dimensional lagrangian surface .    if the volume @xmath35 is given , we can use a single thermodynamical potential @xmath37 that can be expressed as follows : @xmath38    besides , since the internal energy is @xmath39 , it is customary in thermodynamical diagrams to plot the pressure @xmath32 along the abscissa axis , as this was done in the hougen  watson diagram .    on the @xmath14-@xmath15 diagram ,",
    "the _ spinodal _ is defined as the curve which is the locus of all points where the tangents to the isotherms are perpendicular to the @xmath14 axis ( see figures  [ mas_000 ] and [ mas_00 ] ) .",
    "the mathematical model constructed by the author in the papers  @xcite@xcite , which uses the density `` effect '' mentioned in section 3 above , shows that    \\1 ) if the spinodal in the gaseous region for any gas with non - polarized molecules is given , then all the gas isotherms can be constructed ;    \\2 ) if we know the slope of the isotherm for @xmath40 on the @xmath14-@xmath15 diagram ( this is equivalent to knowing the value of the second virial coefficient  @xcite ) as well as the critical isochore for any fluid ( the supercritical state for any collection of non - polarized molecules ) , then we can construct all the isotherms of the fluid up to the critical isochore ;    \\3 ) if we know the liquid binodal for any gas consisting of non - polarized molecules , and also know the pressure @xmath14 and the density @xmath41 on the line @xmath42 ( the zeno line ) , then we can construct the liquid isotherms passing through the point @xmath40 , @xmath43 for so called `` hard '' liquid consisting of non - polarized molecules on the interval @xmath44 .",
    "for an arbitrary liquid , by the _ temperley temperature _ we mean the minimal temperature of the set of liquid isotherms passing through the point @xmath40 , @xmath43 . this temperature ( corresponding to @xmath45 ) , calculated by the physicist temperley for the van - der - waals gas , equals @xmath46  @xcite .    as proved by the author in  @xcite@xcite , the corresponding distribution can be expressed in terms of the polylogarithm and @xmath47 , @xmath48 is riemann s zeta function . ] @xmath49 this distribution yields the following expressions for the thermodynamical potential @xmath37 , the density ( concentration ) @xmath41 and the reduced pressure @xmath14 : @xmath50 @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath23 is the maximal occupation number , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is called the activity ) , @xmath55 , @xmath29 is the collective number of degrees of freedom , @xmath56 is a normalizing constant .    for each type of gas ,",

    "we denote the admissible size of clusters ( maximal occupation number ) can be observed experimentally .",
    "] at the energy level of the critical point .    using   and",
    "the fact that @xmath63 where @xmath64 , we derive @xmath65 .",
    "we pass to the definition of the new classical ideal gas .    note that in the description of the behavior of multi - particle systems it is possible that the initial conditions involve interactions .",
    "consider the following analogy .",
    "there is a battery of canons .",
    "the gunners position the canons and interact with each other in the process . at some moment the command `` fire ! ''",
    "is heard ( it means `` all interactions ( all conversations ) must stop '' ) . at the initial situation interactions took place , but once the canon balls are fired , they fly without interacting with each other",
    ". however elastic collisions between the balls are possible .",
    "this model can be regarded as a model of ideal gas in the traditional understanding only if the initial data is given at time `` minus infinity '' .    _",
    "a generalized classical ideal gas is a classical multi - particle system , where interactions can not occur only inside certain open regions of the diagram , although at the initial moment of time or on the boundary of a region interactions between particles are allowed . in the region itself , only elastic collisions between particles are possible .",
    "_    why is it important to specify the open regions where no interaction ( more precisely , no attraction ) occurs ? obviously , if one must rapidly mix ball bearings of different sizes , it is easier to do this if the balls are not magnetized .",
    "the solution of this problem has several practical applications .",
    "thus the speed with which two gases mix influences the driving force of jet engines : the higher the speed , the higher the driving force .",
    "if there is no attraction between molecules of a mixture of gases moving in a pipeline , the probability of the appearance of liquid bottlenecks is considerably less .",
    "thus the parameters of the van - der - waals gas coincide closely enough with the parameters of the new ( generalized ) gas in the following open regions of the parameters : 1 ) the region from the critical isotherm ( @xmath22 ) to the critical isochore ( @xmath0 ) ; 2 ) the region outside the gas spinodal ; 3 ) the region of hard liquid ( below the temperley temperature , see section  [ tem ] ) .",
    "the van - der - waals model gave rise to the notion of `` van - der - waals force '' .",
    "these forces are long - range forces .",
    "we will consider the van - der - waals forces for the example of the so - called lennard jones potential , which is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the depth of the potential well , @xmath54 is the effective radius , and the attraction is also equal to @xmath68 . for this potential , long - range van - der - waals forces exist .",
    "the quantum dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite ,  @xcite gives an attraction force of the order of @xmath68 .",
    "in the lennard ",
    "jones potential the attraction is also of the form @xmath68 . thus the purely quantum force of attraction smoothly passes into the classical attraction .",
    "this was rigorously proved by the author in  @xcite .",
    "but such forces do not exist for all gases .",
    "experiments tell us that particles must be near each other in order to attract each other .",
    "this means that attraction is either a quantum effect of dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite , or a casimir effect , which is also purely quantum .",
    "this interaction disappears as @xmath69 ( in the classical limit ) , see  @xcite .",
    "the long - range van - der - waals force is true for the lennard ",
    "jones potential , but certainly it is not true for all potentials . let us present an analogy . in quantum mechanics , the quasiclassical solution coincides with the exact solution for certain potential , but such potentials are rare , albeit very important .",
    "thus the theory constructed by the author in  @xcite@xcite and other papers is not based on `` van - der - waals forces '' , but on combining boundary data with the notion of ideal gas as a gas without interaction of particles with a given number of degrees of freedom .    in other words , in the author s approach , which is valid for non - polarized molecules",
    ", interactions can occur only on the boundary or for densities above the critical level .",
    "the critical density is the one above which the molecules are so close to each other ( `` liquid fluids '' ) that the van - der - waals attracting forces come into play ( compare figures  [ mas_03 ] and [ mas_10 ] ) .",
    "[ tem ]    the main practical results that follow from the author s theory are related to metastable states . in that sense ,",
    "the main notion of the thermodynamics described here is not the binodal : the curve on the diagram that indicates the stable phase transition `` vapor - to - liquid '' ( the gas binodal ) and the phase transition `` liquid - to - vapor '' ( the liquid binodal ) .",
    "the main notion is the spinodal  the curve on the diagram that delimits the regions of stable and metastable states ( a more precise definition of the spinodal was given above ) .",
    "it is practically impossible to reach values of the thermodynamical parameters on the spinodal experimentally , because that requires `` infinite time '' .    from relations   as @xmath70 we obtain the following equations : @xmath71 @xmath72    for @xmath73 , we obtain the spinodal defined above .",

    "the figure shows that the isotherms practically coincide except at points near critical values . in regions with less than critical parameter values ,",
    "the coincidence is up to 0.006% , while at points near critical values the error is of the order of 0.01% .",
    "note the important point @xmath96 . at that point , the maximal discrepancy between the isotherms is observed .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath93 .    for isotherms corresponding to temperatures less than the temperley temperature ( `` cluster - free liquids '' ) ,",
    "we obtain a very precise coincidence between the isotherms constructed according to the distribution   and the isotherms coming from the van - der - waals model .",
    "the temperature @xmath97 specifies a boundary above which the number @xmath23 ( maximal occupation number ) becomes infinite .",
    "we introduce an additional parameter , the integer  @xmath23 , specifying the maximal occupation number for clusters when particles do not interact with each other except at the boundaries of the regions .",
    "first of all , this is the open region of ordinary ideal gas , where the density vanishes @xmath98 .",
    "the boundary conditions are well determined by the second virial coefficient , which can be found from the van - der - waals equation .. this coefficient , as we indicated above , gives the slope of the isotherm on the hougen ",

    "if we consider the situation for temperatures above the temperley temperatures , then we have to specify one more constant , i.e. , the initial conditions on the spinodal do not suffice .",
    "this second condition can also be found from the critical isochore of the van - der - waals gas .",
    "we are dealing with ideal gas , i.e. , a gas without interaction ( attraction ) of particles for @xmath98 .",
    "however , in those regions where the density is high , i.e. , @xmath99 , attraction between particles can occur .",
    "it is on the isochore @xmath0 that we must take the second initial condition .",
    "so what we are doing is imposing boundary conditions on the derivative on one of the boundaries and imposing ordinary boundary conditions on the other .    .",

    "on the other boundary , one can find two constants : the number of degrees of freedom and the maximal occupation number @xmath23 .",
    "after that we can compare the isotherms of the ideal parastatistical ( noninteracting ) gas with the corresponding van - der - waals gas isotherms .",
    "see figure  [ mas_03 ] .",
    "now let us consider liquids .    in liquids collisions of molecules occur so often that they limit the number of collective degrees of freedom of the molecules to two and hamper their arbitrary motion .",
    "the system of prohibitions for the collection of molecules can be considered in a more detailed and complicated way in the framework of their quantum - mechanical description ( see  @xcite )    we will call _ congestion _ any state of a system of molecules for which the collective number of degrees of freedom is less than two . the liquids that we consider are systems of molecules in the state of congestion .",
    "let us consider some analogies .",
    "in a normal state , an individual locust has 3 degrees of freedom ( in the sense that it can move in three independent directions ) .",
    "the uniting of locusts into a dense flock is similar to the phase transition of gas into liquid  @xcite .",
    "another analogy has to do with human beings .",
    "a person in a crowd is subjected to a number of exclusions related to the people near him and to the psychology of crowds .",
    "the above analogies correspond to the new notion of liquid consisting of noninteracting particles ( balls ) with less than two degrees of freedom  a generalization of the notion of hard liquid .",
    "a very similar model of liquid without attraction as a dense incompressible ideal gas was considered earlier by some physicists  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the value @xmath106 ( or , what is the same , the value 2 for the number @xmath29 of degrees of freedom ) is in a certain sense critical .",
    "the author proved in  @xcite , that if @xmath107 , the spectrum near zero becomes very sparse ( compare  ) .",

    "[ concl ]    caratheodory proposed an approach in which thermodynamics is described as a `` limiting '' theory .",
    "that approach is very important because it indicates the directions in which this `` limiting '' model can be extended .",
    "caratheodory introduced the notion of equilibrium quasi - statical process in thermodynamics ; in such a process , equilibrium is achieved by damping forces such as friction ( viscosity ) , after which the damping forces are considered negligible .",
    "his idea is that the damping forces ( viscosity ) are needed to achieve equilibrium , and after that must be disregarded , so that an invertible process ( a quasi - statical process ) begins .",
    "as shown by the author in  @xcite , the definition of quasi - statical process given by caratheodory requires additional constraints or additional properties that consist in the following . at the beginning of a quasi - statical process , besides the damping effects , an important role is played by the gravitational attraction of the earth .",
    "this attraction is small , but nevertheless it plays its role in bringing the process to a state that may be described in the framework of phenomenological thermodynamics .",
    "if we try to carry out this procedure with mathematical accuracy , we must first argue in the framework of hydrodynamics , where viscosity occurs , and , after a long period of time , make viscosity tend to zero .",
    "but it turns out that this ca nt always be done .",
    "it can not be done on the spinodal , in particular , near the critical point . in a small region near the critical point",
    "( in which the temperature differs from the critical one by @xmath126 degrees or less ) a phenomenon akin to turbulence sets in .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ opalescence _ because besides turbulence and vortex effects , a change in the color of light takes place .",
    "let us return to the role of earth s gravitation .",
    "the so - called _ dew point _ is the state of the gas in which little droplets ( tiny balls ) appear ( they will form what in everyday language is called dew ) .",
    "these little balls are not stable until their radius reaches a certain critical value .",
    "in that situation the pressure inside the droplet will be greater than the pressure outside it .",
    "if additional relations due to surface tension are not introduced , then we come to a contradiction with one of the most important laws of equilibrium . in order to overcome this contradiction ,",
    "sometimes additional equations are given , thus making the mathematical model more complicated .",
    "but once we take the earth s gravitation into account , the following picture arises .",
    "the amalgamation of droplets leads to an energetically more favorable state .",
    "hence all the droplets , falling to the bottom of the test tube , will merge , and an almost flat boundary of the water appears ( provided the test tube is not too narrow ) .",
    "we then obtain the correct `` gas - liquid '' equilibrium relations that were formulated in the past by the great physicists .",
    "therefore we must take into account the long period of time needed for the droplets to reach the bottom . and",
    "so the earth s gravitation must play its role in this process as well .",
    "the role of the earth s gravitation is also important in the following situation.when heaters are turned on in a house , after a while equilibrium will be reached and a uniform temperature will be established in the house , so that the temperature in different rooms will be approximately the same .",
    "however , this happens because of _ convection _ : warm air from the heater will rise because of the laws of gravitation ( the earth s attraction ) .",
    "whirling flows of hot air circulate and finally , because of viscosity , equilibrium sets in .",
    "the fact that we consider a process which is limiting with respect to viscosity allows the introduction of corrections that take into account viscosity near the critical point .",
    "similarly , by taking into account earth s gravitation , we can put the clusters into a certain order when @xmath127 ( where @xmath62 is the maximal occupation number at the energy level of the critical point ) . can be observed experimentally .",

    "one with a minimal ( zero ) energy level and the other with positive values of minimal energy .",
    "particles with energies from the second series move with relatively high velocities even when their energy is near the minimum energy for that series .",
    "the mean number of particles in each series can be determined .",
    "the mean energy corresponds to the mean value of all the energy levels and includes both series ( see also  @xcite ) .              as the result ,",
    "a picture similar to the tissa  landau two - liquid model arises ; in it , the superfluid component flows through the normal liquid without any resistance .",
    "for this reason , the second series can be called superfluid . in our case , this is not a quantum effect , it is the consequence of the caratheodory axioms , leading to an invertible process , which require that we put viscosity equal to zero .",
    "it is similar to the `` superfluid '' motion of gas without resistance .",
    "as the author has proved , for @xmath128 , the supercritical fluid splits into two series : a cluster sponge , consisting of clusters of liquid type and gas monomers with viscosity equal to zero that interact with each other , see  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "obviously , in such a two - fluid system , the pressure in both components is the same .",
    "hence the distribution of pressure does not change , while the spectrum will accumulate near zero as density increases because of the gravitational attraction of earth . by comparing to van - der - waals gas",
    ", we find the value of the cut - off parameter @xmath130 ( from momenta ) of the form   for each point of the isotherm .",
    "the value of the cut - off parameter  @xmath136 is the smaller when the density of the normal series is the greater  because of the law of the earth s attraction .",
    "the parameter @xmath130 may be chosen so that the isotherms  - will coincide with the isotherms of the van - der - waals isotherms , see figure  [ mas_09 ] .",
    "naturally , the pressure does not depend on the series .",
    "figure  [ mas_10 ] shows the coincidence of the isotherms in the van - der - waals model with the isotherms obtained by the author for the case where the value of @xmath136 is chosen due to the van - der - waals model .",
    "thus , by taking into account the earth s gravitational attraction , we split the fluid obtained when @xmath132 into two dispersive regions .",
    "sometimes experimenters actually see a surface film , as in the gas - liquid picture . to justify this model , the law of conservation of the number of degrees of freedom and the tissa  landau model are used .    at",
    "@xmath138 liquids turn into solids . this fact is not taken into account in the van - der - waals model",
    ". therefore the comparison of the isotherms of the van - der - waals model with the isotherms derived by the author can only be made near the temperley temperature  @xcite , see figure  [ mas_11 ] .",
