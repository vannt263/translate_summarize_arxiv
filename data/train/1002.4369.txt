    "de sitter ( ds ) space is one of the curved spacetime which has attracted more attention in quantum field theory during the past two decades .",
    "one of the main reason resides in the fact that it is maximally symmetric and several physical problems can be exactly solvable on this background ; moreover in great number of inflationary models , approximated ds spacetime is employed to solve relevant problems in standard cosmology . during an inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities and may affect the transition toward the true vacuum .",
    "these fluctuations play important role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "it is well known that different types of topological defects may have been formed in the early universe after planck time by the vacuum phase transition @xcite .",
    "depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold , @xmath1 , these are domain wall , strings , monopole and texture .",
    "cosmic strings and monopoles seem to be the most probably to be observed .",
    "cosmic strings are linear topologically stable gravitational .",
    "the gravitational field produced by a cosmic string may be approximated by a planar angle deficit in the two - dimensional sub - space perpendicular to the string .",
    "although recent observations data on the cosmic microwave background have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbation , they are still candidate for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma ray burst @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "recently , cosmic strings have attracted renewed interest partly because a variant of their formation mechanism is proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "global monopoles are spherically symmetric topological stable gravitational defects which appear in the framework of grand unified theories . these objects could be produced as a consequence of spontaneous breakdown of a global @xmath2 gauge symmetry to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field produced by global monopoles may be approximated by a solid angle deficit in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the analysis of quantum vacuum fluctuations associated with matter fields in curved spacetime are relevant in a semiclassical theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the validity conditions under which the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 , can act as sources for a semiclassical gravitational field are discussed in @xcite . in this context , as the first steps in this direction , here we shall investigate the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the square of quantum fields , @xmath0 , on the background of four - dimensional de sitter spacetime considering the presence of a cosmic string and global monopole in it .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present backgrounds associated with the geometries under considerations and the solutions of the klein - gordon equations admitting an arbitrary curvature coupling .",
    "also we present the corresponding wightman functions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we calculate the vacuum expectation values of the field squared .",
    "finally we leave for the section [ sec4 ] our more relevant conclusions about this paper .",
    "although gravitational topological defects have been first introduced in a minkowski bulk , they can also considered in ds background :    * for a cosmic string in ds spacetime , the geometry can be given by the following line element @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 $ ] define the coordinates on the conical geometry .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , is related with the linear mass density of the string , and the parameter @xmath9 is related with the cosmological constant and ricci scalar by the formulae @xmath10 * for a global monopole in ds spacetime , the geometry can be given by the following line element @xcite : @xmath11 where the coordinates , @xmath12 , are defined in the intervals @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , which codifies the presence of the global monopole , is associated with the energy scale where the defect is formed . for this geometry",
    "the curvature scalar reads @xmath17    in addition to the synchronous time coordinates @xmath18 , we may use the conformal time @xmath19  defined according to @xmath20 to express the above line elements . in this new coordinate system the line elements ( [ ds1 ] ) and ( [ ds0 ] )",
    "read :    * for the cosmic string , @xmath21 * for global monopole , @xmath22    as we can see , both line elements above are conformally related with the corresponding cosmic string and global monopole geometries by the function factor @xmath23 .      an important quantity to calculate vacuum polarization effects is the positive frequency wightman function . because in this paper we are more interested to analyse the vacuum polarization effects due to a cosmic string and a global monopole in ds space , the main objective of this subsection is to calculate the positive frequency wightman functions associated with a quantum massive scalar field in a four - dimensional ds spacetime taking into account the presence of the defects . in order to do that we first obtain the complete set of eigenfunctions for the klein - gordon equation below , admitting an arbitrary curvature coupling : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the arbitrary curvature coupling constant .",
    "the complete set of solutions of ( [ kg ] ) in the coordinate system defined by ( [ ds - cs ] ) is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the hankel and bessel functions , respectively , and @xmath30 this solution is characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 can be found by the orthonormalization condition @xmath35=\\delta _ { \\sigma , \\sigma ^{\\prime } } \\ , \\label{normcond}\\ ] ] where the integral is evaluated over the spatial hypersurface @xmath36 , and @xmath37 represents the kronecker - delta for discrete index and dirac - delta function for continuous ones .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath38 for the normalization coefficient .",
    "we shall employ the mode - sum formula to calculate the positive frequency wightman function : @xmath39 substituting ( [ sol1 ] ) , with respective coefficient ( [ coef ] ) , into ( [ modesum ] ) we obtain @xmath40^{\\ast } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the analysis of vacuum polarizations in ds spacetime , have been developed by many authors in literature .",
    "here we are mainly interested in quantum effects induced by the presence of the cosmic string . in order to investigate these effects",
    "we introduce below the subtracted wightman function @xmath43 as the presence of the string does not change the curvature for the background manifold for @xmath44 , this function does not present additional divergences in the calculations of vacuum polarizations . hence , for these points the function @xmath45 is finite in the coincidence limit .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider only the particular case where the parameter @xmath46 is an integer number .",
    "for this case the wightman function given in ( [ green1 ] ) can be expressed by the sum of @xmath46 images of ds wightman function @xcite @xmath47 with @xmath48 being @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the associated legendre function of first kind .",
    "we can see that only the @xmath51 component of ( [ greenk ] ) is divergent in the coincidence limit , @xmath52 .",
    "finally we have that @xmath45 is given by @xmath53 which is finite at the coincidence limit .",
    "the complete set of solutions of ( [ kg ] ) in the coordinate system defined by ( [ ds - gm ] ) is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 represents the spherical harmonics of degree @xmath57 . in ( [ sol11 ] ) , @xmath58 denotes the set of quantum numbers , being @xmath59 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 can be found by the orthonormalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) .",
    "it reads @xmath60 employing the mode - sum formula ( [ modesum ] ) to calculate the positive frequency wightman function , after many intermediate steps , we obtain @xcite : @xmath61 where the variable @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63",
    "having obtained the positive frequency wightman functions the next steps is the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the field square .",
    "formally this value is obtained by computing the wightman function at the coincidence limit : @xmath65 however this procedure provides a divergent result . to obtain a finite and well defined result we shall apply in this calculation the point - splitting renormalization method .",
    "this procedure is based upon a divergence subtraction scheme in the coincidence limit of the wightman function .",
    "this will be done in a manifest form , by subtracting from the wightman function the singular part of the hadamard expansion , @xmath66 , before applying the coincidence limit , as shown below : @xmath67 \\ .\\ ] ]    this calculation will be developed separately in this section specifying the physical situation under consideration .      according to our previous analysis",
    "we may write the complete wightman function as the sum of a pure ds part plus the subtracted one as shown below : @xmath68 consequently @xmath69 the divergence is contained only in the part corresponding to the pure ds spacetime .",
    "the part induced by the cosmic string is finite for points outside the string .    due to the maximal symmetry of the ds spacetime ,",
    "@xmath70 does not depend on the spacetime point . in the special case of @xmath46 being an integer number @xmath71 is essentially simplified and can be given by ( [ gsubk ] ) : @xmath72^{1/2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 note that the vev ( [ phi ] ) is a function of the ratio @xmath74 which is the proper distance from the string , @xmath75 , measured in the units of the ds curvature radius @xmath9 .    in figure @xmath76",
    "we have plotted the string induced part in the vev of the field squared versus the ratio @xmath77 for minimally coupled scalar field ( @xmath78 ) with @xmath79 ( left panel ) and @xmath80 ( right panel ) .",
    "the numbers near the curves correspond to the values of the parameter @xmath46 . for the left panel",
    "the parameter @xmath81 is real and for the right one this parameter is imaginary . in the latter case the oscillatory behavior of the vev",
    "is seen at large distances from the string .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have revisited the quantum effects associated with massive scalar fields in four - dimensional ds space in presence of two specific gravitational topological defects : @xmath82 an idealized cosmic string and @xmath83 point - like global monopole .",
    "in fact in these analysis we were more interested to calculate the contributions induced by the gravitational defects themselves on the vev of the field square .",
    "the reason is because the vacuum polarization effects associated with a quantum scalar quantum fields in ds spacetime have been investigated by many authors in literature , and the corresponding results do not depend on the spacetime point . in this way we can compare the influence due to the defects on the vacuum polarization effects with the ds contribution .    in order to develop these analysis we have presented the complete wightman functions as the sum of two contributions :",
    "@xmath82 the first ones correspond to the wightman function on the bulk in the absence of the defects and @xmath83 the second ones are induced by the presence of the defects . as consequence of this formalism ,",
    "we have obtained , for the vev of the field square , the following result : @xmath84 where @xmath85\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left.\\frac{(6\\xi-1)^2}{m^2\\alpha^2}+\\frac1{30m^2\\alpha^2}-6\\xi+\\frac23\\right\\ } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponds to the ds spacetime contribution , in ( [ pds ] ) corresponds the logarithmic derivative of the gamma - function . ] and the second term on the right hand side of ( [ pp ] ) , @xmath86 , corresponds to the induced gravitational defects contributions . by the results obtained in ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ phid4 ] ) , for the latter , the corresponding results become more relevant than ( [ pds ] ) near the defects . at large distance",
    "the situation is the opposite , @xmath87 becomes dominant .",
    "the results found for @xmath86 are divergent at the defects position , i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "these facts are consequence of the idealized models adopted for them . in a realistic point of view , cosmic strings and global monopoles have a non - vanishing radius . taking into account a nontrivial inner structure for these defects ,",
    "the vev associated with quantum fields should be considered in both , external and internal regions , separately . regarding to this fact ,",
    "considering these defects in a minkowski bulk , the vev associated with scalar field in global monopole spacetime have been analysed in @xcite and @xcite for scalar and fermionic fields , respectively . in these analysis",
    "we have obtained that the vacuum polarization effects in the region inside the defect are regular at @xmath88 .",
    "we expect that assuming a more realistic model for cosmic string and global monopole in ds spacetime , similar results will also be found .",
