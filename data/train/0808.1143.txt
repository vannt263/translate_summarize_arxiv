    "the heavy quarkonium is a good object to study the nonperurbative nature of qcd , see  @xcite for a review . at zero temperature , for example",
    ", the charmonium spectrum reveals important information about confinement and inter - quark potentials in qcd@xcite .",
    "the heavy quarkonium is one of main probes that provides us with information about thermal properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations indicate that the charmonium states will remain bound up to about 1.6 to 2 times the critical temperature @xmath0 of the deconfinement transition@xcite .",
    "recent studies based on a qcd sum rule approach have claimed that the change in the properties of heavy quarkonia around @xmath0 could _ effectively _ be an order parameter of the deconfinement transition  @xcite .",
    "the claim is based on the following observation . at @xmath0 , the energy density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 of the qcd system increase drastically , which closely related to a drop of the thermal gluon condensate @xmath3 since g^2(t ) g^2(0)-(-3p ) .",
    "for instance , lattice results on the gluon condensate at finite temperature  @xcite indicate that the value of the gluon condensate shows a drastic change around @xmath0 regardless of the number of quark flavor .",
    "the change in the gluon condensate leads to a dropping heavy quarkonium mass around @xmath0 when we ignore shift in the width of the quarkonium  @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite , the mass drops significantly at or just above @xmath0 . from these studies",
    "@xcite , we see that the gluon condensate is very sensitive to the deconfinement transition of qcd and could serve as a messenger for deconfinement transition , which could be observed through the heavy quarkonium in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) .",
    "we note here that dropping heavy quarkonium mass at @xmath0 has previously observed in a study based on a ads / qcd model . in the study  @xcite based on the soft wall model  @xcite ,",
    "the dropping is due to a hawking - page transition , and so deconfinement transition , which is qualitatively consistent with qcd sum rule results .",
    "we remark here that although the deconfinement transition transition is driven by the temperature , the drastic change in the value of the gluon condensate is mostly due to the deconfinement transition itself since the value of the temperature does not change much near the transition point .    in this work we study the effect of the gluon condensate on a heavy - quark potential in ads / cft  @xcite . to this end",
    ", we adopt a deformed ads background with back - reaction due to the gluon condensate  @xcite .",
    "for a deformed ads with a non - trivial dilaton potential , we refer to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "we observe that as the gluon condensate decreases in deconfined phase , the potential becomes deeper .",
    "since the mass of a heavy quarkonium @xmath4 is roughly @xmath5 , we could associate the deepening of the potential with dropping of the heavy quarkonium mass . to see this more clearly",
    ", we solve schrdinger equation with our heavy quark potential in the framework of potential model approach .",
    "our observation could be interpreted as the dropping of the heavy quarkonium mass right after the deconfinement transition , which may be a reminiscence of the deconfinement transition since the value of the gluon condensate decreases much with the deconfinement transition .",
    "through the ads / cft correspondence , we can easily evaluate the potential between heavy quark and anti - quark with a given background metric  @xcite . to obtain the heavy quark potential",
    ", we consider a wilson loop living on the boundary of the five - dimensional ads space where the heavy quark and anti - quark are set at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , see fig .",

    ", we find the relation between inter - quark distance @xmath14 and @xmath15 r=2_0^z_0 dz .",
    "the regularized energy is e_adsbh^r = _ 0^z_0 dz -_0^z_h dz [ eadsbh ] , where @xmath16 , and the second term is corresponding to the masses of two free heavy quarks at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "( [ eadsbh ] ) is nothing but the energy , equivalently potential , of heavy quark pair minus two free quark masses .",

    "we remark here that to be more realistic , we should be able to distinguish the dissociation temperature of charmonium from that of bottomonium . for this we may need to introduce an energy scale such as an infrared cutoff other than the temperature to fix the scale of the system at hand .",
    "to study the effect of the gluon condensation on the heavy quark potential , we consider the 5d gravity action in euclidean with a dilaton coupled s = d^5 x ( -r - + _ m ^m ) , where @xmath21 is the 5d newton constant , and @xmath22 is the ads curvature . by solving the coupled equations , dilaton equation of motion and the einstein equation , with a suitable ansatz , we obtain two relevant backgrounds .",

    "thus , the dilaton - wall background is for confined phase , and the dilaton black hole describes deconfined phase .",
    "first , we consider the euclidean dilaton - wall background  @xcite ds^2= ( ( dx^2 + dt^2 ) + dz^2 ) [ dads ] . from now on we will take @xmath30 for simplicity . with the gauge fixing ^0=t , ^1=x   z = z(x ) , the nambu - goto action on the background metric ( [ dads ] ) becomes s_dads & = & _ -t/2^t/2 dt _",

    "the first integral , hamiltonian , is then [ ham1 ] h = - . due to the conserved hamiltonian , after comparing the hamiltonian in ( [ ham1 ] ) with that evaluated at @xmath31 h = - , we can easily find the integral relation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 r=2 _ 0^z_0 dz , where =( ) ^ ,   _ 0= ( ) ^ .",

    "another way to fix the value of @xmath37 is to fit a heavy quarkonium mass . in @xcite , @xmath37 is fixed by the lowest @xmath38 mass , @xmath39 , and it is given by @xmath40 .",
    "the regularized energy is given by e^r_dads & = & _ 0^z_0 dz & & - _ 0^z_c dz , [ econfined ] where @xmath37 behaves as an ir cutoff , so @xmath41 and @xmath15 should be defined in the region smaller than @xmath37 .",

    "this metric is for deconfined phase . for discussion on the phases associated with the dilaton black hole background in other context , we refer to @xcite .",
    "as discussed , @xmath28 is the gluon condensation . although the metric does not allow to define the hawking temperature  @xcite by requiring absence of conical singularity as long as @xmath43 , we could associate @xmath25 with a temperature  @xcite . for more details about thermodynamics on the dilaton black hole background ,",

    "r&=&2 _ 0^z_0 dz z^2 , where =( ) ^ , _ 0= ( ) ^ .",

    "[ fig : dadsbh ] , we plot the heavy quark potential with a fixed @xmath25 for a few values of @xmath28 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dadsbh ] , we can see that the heavy quark potential becomes deeper as @xmath28 decreases , implying the value of the gluon condensate drops in deconfined phase , the mass of heavy quarkonium decreases .",
    "for the heavy quarkonium , this is so since the mass of it is roughly equal to the masses of two heavy quarks plus the potential .",
    "noting that the value of the gluon condensate suddenly drops near @xmath0 of qcd deconfinement transition  @xcite , we may conclude that our study predicts dropping quarkonium mass just after the deconfinement transition .",
    "finally , we study the @xmath25 dependence of the potential with fixed @xmath28 . note that @xmath25 is related to a temperature , @xmath49 ,  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ c02 ] , the potential becomes shallow as @xmath25 ( temperature ) increases .",
    "this means that the mass of heavy quarkonium increases as we increases the temperature , which is consistent with the result in  @xcite . as expected the value of @xmath17 becomes smaller with increasing temperature , and so easy dissociation of heavy quarkonium at high temperature .    .",
    "here we take @xmath50 . ]      using the heavy quark potential obtained in section [ ssdbh ] , we estimate the mass of heavy quarkonium by solving the schrdinger equation , following potential model approach . in potential models",
    ", it is assumed that the interaction between two heavy quarks in a heavy quarkonium could be described by a heavy quark potential .",
    "since the mass of heavy quarks are much larger than a typical scale of qcd , @xmath51 , the heavy quark system is generically non - relativistic .",
    "our aim in this section is not to give exact numbers for the masses , but to see the role of gluon condensate in the heavy - quark system . to this end",
    "we follow an approximate method given in @xcite and consider only the leading order in @xcite for simplicity . here",
    "we briefly summarize the method and refer to @xcite and references there in for details . to use the method",
    ", potentials should satisfy the following conditions : & & v(r)=-ar^-+r^+v_0 ,  , > 0 , & & v^(r)>0v^(r)0 where @xmath52 is a constant , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are positive constants .",
    "we confirmed that our potential in section [ ssdbh ] satisfies these requirements .",
    "then the binding energy is given by e_n , lv(r_0)+r_0v^(r_0 ) , [ bef ] where higher orders are neglected for simplicity .",
    "@xmath55 is determined by 1 + 2l+(2n_r+1)^1/2=^1/2,n_r , l=0,1,2,3 , .",
    "finally , we arrive at the mass of bound state : m_|qq=2m_q+2 e_n , l .",
    "now , as examples , we consider charm and bottom quarks .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "bottom - quark system and gluon condensate .",
    "here the charm quark mass is @xmath56 and @xmath57 + 0.3 cm in table 3 , we consider the bottom - quark system .",
    "as expected , the mass of bottomoinum decreases as the gluon condensate is to be smaller .",
    "with an observation  @xcite that the gluon condensate is an useful quantity to characterize the qcd deconfinement transition , we calculate the holographic heavy quark potential on deformed ads backgrounds with gluon condensate included .",
    "we also solved the schrdinger equation approximately to estimate the mass of heavy quarkonium , following the potential model approach .",
    "our analysis of the dilaton black hole metric with fixed @xmath25 reveals that the potential becomes deeper as the gluon condensate decreases in deconfined phase .",
    "we associate this with the dropping of the heavy quarkonium mass in deconfined phase . with the deconfinement transition ,",
    "the value of the gluon condensate drops much , and therefore the dropping mass is most likely to occur just after the deconfinement transition .",
    "finally , we study the @xmath25 dependence of the heavy quark potential and show that the potential becomes shallow as we increase @xmath25 .",
    "if we interpret @xmath25 as a temperature  @xcite , our result indicates that the mass of the heavy quarkonium increases with temperature in deconfined phase .",
    "as we increase the temperature right after the deconfinement transition , the mass of a heavy quarkonium increases with temperature , while it decreases with a decreasing gluon condensate . just after the deconfinement transition , although the gluon condensate is not an order parameter of the deconfinement transition , its value does change dramatically with the deconfinement transition . even though the deconfinement transition is driven by the temperature ,",
    "the drastic drop in the value of the gluon condensate is from the deconfinement transition itself since the value of the temperature changes very little around the transition point .",
    "therefore , right after the deconfinement transition , the effect of the gluon condensate should dominate over the temperature .    in conclusion , based on the drastic drop of the gluon condensate right after the deconfinement transition observed in lattice qcd  @xcite ,",
    "our study predicts that the mass of heavy quarkonium just after the deconfinement transition decreases with decreasing gluon condensate , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "as we increase the temperature further above @xmath0 , gluon condensate reduces to increase the mass of heavy quarkonium , while increasing @xmath11 will make it heavier .",
    "therefore , to reach a concrete conclusion on the mass of heavy quarkonium at high temperature , except very close to @xmath0 , we have to perform detailed study on the competition of the two effects : effects of the gluon condensate and temperature ( pure thermal ) . to this end",
    ", it is essential to calculate the temperature dependence of the gluon condensate in ads / cft .",
