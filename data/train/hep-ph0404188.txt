    "recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor ( kamland @xcite and chooz @xcite ) and accelerator ( k2k @xcite ) neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . in the framework of three lepton families , a full description of the lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing at low energies needs twelve physical parameters :    * three charged lepton masses @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which have precisely been measured @xcite ; * three neutrino masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , whose relative sizes ( i.e. , two independent mass - squared differences @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) have roughly been known from solar ( @xmath10 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath11 ) neutrino oscillations ; * three flavor mixing angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whose values have been determined or constrained to an acceptable degree of accuracy from solar ( @xmath15 ) , atmospheric ( @xmath16 ) and reactor ( @xmath17 ) neutrino oscillations ; * three cp - violating phases @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are completely unrestricted by current neutrino data .    the future neutrino oscillation experiments are expected to fix the sign of @xmath21 , to pin down the magnitude of @xmath14 and to probe the `` dirac - type '' cp - violating phase @xmath18 . the proposed precision experiments for the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double beta decay will help determine or constrain the absolute scale of three neutrino masses . some information about the `` majorana - type '' cp - violating phases @xmath19 and @xmath20 may also be achieved from a delicate measurement of the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "however , it seems hopeless to separately determine @xmath19 and @xmath20 from any conceivable sets of feasible neutrino experiments in the foreseeable future .",
    "the phenomenology of lepton masses and flavor mixing at low energies can be formulated in terms of the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath22 and the ( effective ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 .",
    "while the former is in general arbitrary , the latter must be a symmetric matrix required by the majorana nature of three neutrino fields .",
    "hence we diagonalize @xmath22 by using two unitary matrices and @xmath23 by means of a single unitary matrix : @xmath24 the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 , which describes the mismatch between the diagonalizations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the flavor basis where @xmath22 is diagonal and positive , @xmath25 directly links the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath27 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath28 : @xmath29 a convenient parametrization of @xmath25 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have known that @xmath34 holds , but how small @xmath14 is remains an open question .",
    "a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data shows that @xmath14 is most likely to lie in the range @xmath35 @xcite . in this case , we are left with a _ bi - large _ mixing pattern of @xmath25 , which is quite different from the _ tri - small _ mixing pattern of the quark flavor mixing matrix .    to interpret the observed hierarchy of @xmath36 and @xmath21 as well as the bi - large lepton flavor mixing pattern ,",
    "many phenomenological ans@xmath37tze of lepton mass matrices have been proposed in the literature @xcite . a very interesting category of the ans@xmath37tze focus on the vanishing entries or _ texture zeros _ of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in a specific flavor basis , from which some nontrivial and testable relations can be established between the flavor mixing parameters and the lepton mass ratios .",
    "we argue that texture zeros of lepton mass matrices might result from a kind of new ( abelian or non - abelian ) flavor symmetry beyond the standard electroweak model .",
    "such zeros may dynamically mean that the corresponding matrix elements are sufficiently suppressed in comparison with their neighboring counterparts . from a phenomenological point of view , the study of possible texture zeros of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at low energies _ do _ make sense , because it ought to help reveal the underlying structures of leptonic yukawa couplings at a superhigh energy scale .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to analyze the six - zero textures of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in a systematic way . to be specific ,",
    "we take @xmath22 to be symmetric , just as @xmath23 is .",
    "this point is true in a number of so(10 ) grand unification models , in which the group symmetry itself may dictate all fermion mass matrices to be symmetric @xcite .",
    "then a pair of off - diagonal texture zeros in @xmath22 or @xmath23 can be counted as one zero .",
    "we further require that each mass matrix contain three texture zeros , such that the moduli of its three non - vanishing elements can fully be determined in terms of its three mass eigenvalues . and @xmath23 .",
    "] because there exist 20 different patterns of @xmath22 or @xmath23 with three texture zeros , we totally obtain @xmath38 combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with six texture zeros .",
    "a careful analysis shows that only 24 of them , which can be classified into a few distinct categories , are consistent with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath0 level .",
    "we find that the lepton mass matrices in each category have a peculiar feature : they do not have the same structures , but their phenomenological consequences are exactly the same .",
    "character makes the six - zero textures of lepton mass matrices especially interesting for model building .",
    "it is noticed that those 24 patterns of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are difficult to agree with today s experimental data at the @xmath1 level , mainly due to a potential tension between the smallness of @xmath39 and the largeness of @xmath40 .",
    "taking account of a very simple seesaw scenario for six parallel patterns of the charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrices with six zeros , we demonstrate that it is possible to fit the present neutrino data at or below the @xmath1 level .",
    "in particular , the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) can be reconciled with a strong neutrino mass hierarchy in the seesaw case .",
    "specific numerical predictions are also obtained for the neutrino mass spectrum , flavor mixing angles , cp - violating phases and effective masses of the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the remaining part of this article is organized as follows .",
    "a classification of the six - zero textures of lepton mass matrices is presented in section ii , where a few criteria to select the phenomenologically favorable patterns of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are also outlined .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analytical and numerical calculations of 24 patterns of lepton mass matrices with or without the structural parallelism between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a simple application of the seesaw mechanism to the charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrices with six texture zeros is illustrated in section iv .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results in section v.",
    "a symmetric lepton mass matrix @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) has six independent entries . if three of them are taken to be vanishing , we totally arrive at @xmath43 patterns , which are structurally different from one another .",
    "these twenty patterns of @xmath42 can be classified into four categories :    1 .",
    "three diagonal matrix elements of @xmath42 are all vanishing ( type 0 ) : @xmath44 where those non - vanishing entries are simply symbolized by @xmath45 s .",
    "2 .   two diagonal matrix elements of @xmath42 are vanishing ( type i ) : @xmath46 which are of rank three ; and @xmath47 which are of rank two .",
    "one diagonal matrix element of @xmath42 is vanishing ( type ii ) : @xmath48 which are of rank three ; and @xmath49 which are of rank two .",
    "three diagonal matrix elements of @xmath42 are all non - vanishing ( type iii ) : @xmath50    we see that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the well - known zee @xcite and fritzsch @xcite patterns of fermion mass matrices , respectively .",
    "both of them are disfavored in the quark sector @xcite . while the original zee ansatz is also problematic in describing lepton masses and flavor mixing @xcite , the fritzsch ansatz is found to be essentially compatible with current neutrino oscillation data @xcite .    allowing the charged lepton or neutrino mass matrix to take one of the above three - zero textures",
    ", we totally have @xmath38 combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we find that 141 of them can easily be ruled out .",
    "first , the pattern in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is not suitable for @xmath22 , because three charged leptons have a strong mass hierarchy and the sum of their masses ( i.e. , the trace of @xmath23 ) can not be zero .",
    "second , the rank - two patterns in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) are not suitable for @xmath22 , because the former must have one vanishing mass eigenvalue .",
    "third , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can not simultaneously take the pattern in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , otherwise there would be no lepton flavor mixing .",
    "we are therefore left with @xmath53 combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    to pick out the phenomenologically favorable six - zero patterns of lepton mass matrices from 259 combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", one has to confront their concrete predictions for the lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing angles with current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the strategies to do so are outlined below :    1 .   for each combination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "we do the diagonalization like eq .",
    "( 1 ) . because @xmath22 has been specified to be symmetric",
    ", @xmath54 must hold .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath55 can be given in terms of two mass ratios ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite ) and two irremovable phase parameters . ( or @xmath23 ) to be positive .",
    "we are then left with two free phase parameters in @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) . ] a similar treatment is applicable for the neutrino sector .",
    "the ratio of two independent neutrino mass - squared differences reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath61 ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) must hold , but it remains unclear whether @xmath63 ( normal mass hierarchy ) or @xmath64 ( inverted mass hierarchy ) .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath36 and @xmath65 , which are obtained from a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , have been listed in table i. we are therefore able to figure out the allowed range of @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath67 can then be obtained .",
    "its nine elements depend on four mass ratios ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and two irremovable phase combinations , which will subsequently be denoted as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the standard parametrization of @xmath25 , as shown in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one has @xmath74 the experimental results for @xmath75 , @xmath40 and @xmath76 are also listed in table i. 3 .   with the help of current experimental data , we make use of eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) to look for the parameter space of each pattern of lepton mass matrices .",
    "the relevant free parameters include two neutrino mass ratios ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and two cp - violating phases ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the latter may in general vary between 0 and @xmath77 . in our numerical analysis",
    "the points of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be generated by scanning their possible ranges according to a flat random number distribution .",
    "thus the density of output points in the @xmath78 and @xmath79 plots will be a clear reflection of strong constraints , imposed by the neutrino oscillation data and the model ( or ansatz ) itself , on these parameters .",
    "a combination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be rejected , if its parameter space is found to be empty .    of course , whether the parameter space of a specific pattern of lepton mass matrices is empty or not depends on the confidence levels of relevant experimental data .",
    "we shall focus on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 intervals of @xmath36 , @xmath21 , @xmath75 , @xmath40 and @xmath76 given in ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a plain scan of the unknown parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 is empirically simple and conservative , provided the reasonable ranges of @xmath36 _ etc _ have been fixed . in this approximation",
    "the error bars of those observables need not be statistically treated .    examining all 259 combinations of the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices",
    "is a lengthy but straightforward work .",
    "we find that only 24 of them , whose @xmath22 and @xmath23 both belong to type i given in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath0 level .",
    "the detailed analytical and numerical calculations of those 24 patterns will be presented in sections iii and iv .",
    "once the parameter space of a given pattern of lepton mass matrices is fixed , one may obtain some predictions for the neutrino mass spectrum and leptonic cp violation .",
    "for example , the absolute values of three neutrino masses can be determined as follows : @xmath80 three cp - violating phases in the standard parametrization of @xmath25 are also calculable . as for cp violation in neutrino - neutrino or antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations ,",
    "its strength is measured by the jarlskog invariant @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath81 reads @xmath82 where the subscripts @xmath83 and @xmath84 run respectively over @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath81 depends on both @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath87 is achievable , then leptonic cp- and t - violating effects could be measured in a variety of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite in the future .",
    "in addition , interesting predictions can be achieved for the effective mass of the tritium beta decay @xmath88 and that of the neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath89 : @xmath90 the present experimental upper bound on @xmath88 is @xmath91 ev @xcite , while the sensitivity of the proposed katrin experiment is expected to reach @xmath92 ev @xcite . in comparison , the upper limit @xmath93 ev has been set by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration @xcite at the @xmath94 confidence level . at the @xmath95 confidence level . ]",
    "the sensitivity of the next - generation experiments for the neutrinoless double beta decay is possible to reach @xmath96 mev to 50 mev @xcite .",
    "the 24 patterns of lepton mass matrices , which are found to be compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath0 level , all belong to the type - i textures listed in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . to make our subsequent discussions more convenient and concrete , we rewrite those type - i textures of @xmath22 or @xmath23 and list them in table ii .",
    "two comments are in order .    *",
    "each type - i texture of @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) can be decomposed into @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes a diagonal phase matrix and @xmath99 is a real mass matrix with three positive non - vanishing elements .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath99 requires an orthogonal transformation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 ) stand for the physical masses of charged leptons ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) or neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) .",
    "then the unitary matrix @xmath105 ( i.e. , @xmath55 or @xmath106 ) used to diagonalize @xmath42 takes the form @xmath107 . * note that the matrix elements of @xmath99 and @xmath108 can be determined in terms of @xmath101 .",
    "this calculability allows us to express the rank-3 ( or rank-2 ) patterns of @xmath42 in a universal way , as shown in table ii .",
    "it turns out that the relation @xmath109 holds for those rank-3 textures , where @xmath110 as for three rank-2 textures , we have @xmath111 it is easy to check that @xmath112 is a real orthogonal matrix ; i.e. , @xmath113 holds .",
    "in addition , @xmath114 and @xmath115 hold .",
    "we have six parallel patterns of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath116 which are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath0 level . given @xmath117 being diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 ) can then be diagonalized by @xmath121 as a result of eq .
