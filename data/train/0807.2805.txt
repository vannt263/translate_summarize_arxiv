    "<S> we study the micromechanics of collagen - i gel with the goal of bridging the gap between theory and experiment in the study of biopolymer networks . </S>",
    "<S> three - dimensional images of fluorescently labeled collagen are obtained by confocal microscopy and the network geometry is extracted using a 3d network skeletonization algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> each fiber is modeled as a worm - like - chain that resists stretching and bending , and each cross - link is modeled as torsional spring . </S>",
    "<S> the stress - strain curves of networks at three different densities are compared to rheology measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows good agreement with experiment , confirming that strain stiffening of collagen can be explained entirely by geometric realignment of the network , as opposed to entropic stiffening of individual fibers . </S>",
    "<S> the model also suggests that at small strains , cross - link deformation is the main contributer to network stiffness whereas at large strains , fiber stretching dominates . </S>",
    "<S> since this modeling effort uses networks with realistic geometries , this analysis can ultimately serve as a tool for understanding how the mechanics of fibers and cross - links at the microscopic level produce the macroscopic properties of the network . while the focus of this paper is on the mechanics of collagen </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate a framework that can be applied to many biopolymer networks .    </S>",
    "<S> collagen is the most abundant animal protein @xcite and its mechanics have been studied in great detail @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it takes on many morphologies , including skin , tendons , ligaments , individual fibers , and gels . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the mechanics of collagen - i gels , shown in figure  [ fig : summary]a . </S>",
    "<S> these gels provide a relatively simple structure that can be noninvasively observed by confocal microscopy @xcite and used as a scaffold for growing artificial tissues @xcite , and as a 3d environment for studying cell motility @xcite and tumor invasion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a critical first step in understanding these systems is to develop a model for the collagen gel alone . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give a successful theoretical model of the micromechanics of realistic networks .    </S>",
    "<S> collagen - i gels belong to a class of materials known as biopolymers . </S>",
    "<S> other examples include actin , found in the cytoskeleton and fibrin , a component of blood clots . </S>",
    "<S> a common feature of biopolymer networks is their ability to strain stiffen by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude at large strains ( figure  [ fig : summary]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cause of this strain stiffening is not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> storm et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite attributed strain stiffening in all biopolymer networks to the pulling out of entropic modes of individual filaments . </S>",
    "<S> their calculation required the assumption that deformations are affine . </S>",
    "<S> later , heussinger et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed how one could deconstruct the network deformation into a set of floppy modes . </S>",
    "<S> they concluded that accounting for the non - affinity was necessary in describing the elastic properties of the network . </S>",
    "<S> onck and colleagues @xcite have proposed the alternative hypothesis that strain stiffening is due to the rearrangement of the fibers as the network is strained ( figures  [ fig : summary]d and [ fig : summary]e ) . resolving this debate has been difficult since almost all theoretical analysis has been on artificially generated networks . </S>",
    "<S> the few examples of quantitative comparisons to experiment in the literature @xcite are not able to quantitatively fit the full stress - strain response of the gel at varying densities using a single set of parameters .    </S>",

    "<S> f ) comparison of the stress - strain response between the model and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : summary],width=288 ]    in this paper , we bridge the gap between model and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> three dimensional images of fluorescently labeled collagen gels at different densities are imaged by confocal microscopy ( figure  [ fig : summary]a ) and the network geometry is extracted using a custom fiber extraction ( fire ) algorithm ( figure  [ fig : summary]b ) @xcite . the gel is modeled as a random network of cross - linked fibers , as described below , and the stress - strain response is compared to that measured by an ar - g2 rheometer . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement between model and experiment is obtained by fitting a single parameter , the cross - link stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are described in detail in @xcite .    in the model for the collagen gel , </S>",
    "<S> each fiber is treated as a discrete worm - like - chain ( wlc ) @xcite which resists stretching and bending , and each cross - link is treated as a torsional spring , thus more stiff than a freely rotating pin joint but less stiff than a welded joint of fixed angle . </S>",
    "<S> the stretching modulus of an individual fiber is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the young s modulus and @xmath4 is the cross - sectional area . </S>",
    "<S> the young s modulus of a fiber in aqueous conditions has been estimated to be between 30 - 800 mpa @xcite and we use a modulus of 50 mpa , which fits the data well and is also close to the value chosen by stylianopoulous et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 79mpa ) to fit their model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that a single fiber will stiffen by a factor of 2 - 4 when strained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose here to use a constant @xmath3 both to reduce the number of parameters in the model and to see if geometric reorientation of the network is enough to explain strain stiffening . </S>",
    "<S> stylianopoulos and barocas @xcite also explored the bilinear and exponential constitutive relations for the individual fibers and observed only minor effects on the macroscopic network behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of each fiber is @xmath5 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bending modulus of the fiber is given by @xmath6 pn-@xmath1m@xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no cross - linking agent has been added to the gel and very little is known about the nature of the naturally formed collagen cross - links . </S>",
    "<S> we find that we can fit all the data by setting the torsional spring stiffness to @xmath9 pn-@xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> to compare @xmath10 to @xmath11 , we consider @xmath12 , where the mean cross - link spacing is given by @xmath13 @xmath1 m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we find that @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason for a larger @xmath11 could be an increase in fiber radius near the cross - links by a factor of 2 , since bending stiffness scales by @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that in the undeformed state of the network , there are no internal stresses . </S>",
    "<S> thus the fibers have an innate curvature and the cross - links have an equilibrium angle equal to that in their initial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore entropic contributions to the fiber mechanics . while the geometric persistence length of these fibers has been measured to be 20 @xmath1 m @xcite , the thermal persistence length is much longer @xmath16 cm . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the case that the strain stiffening is dominated by thermal compliance , one would expect to see a decrease in the yield strain with increasing concentration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> collagen gels , however , have been shown to have a constant yield strain of about 60% for a wide range of concentrations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total energy in the network for a given configuration is given below . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the number of elements of type @xmath19 , which denotes stretching , bending , and cross - link , @xmath20 is the length of stretching element , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the bending and cross - link angles respectively , and @xmath23 indicates the difference between the deformed and undeformed state . to calculate the stress - strain relationship of our model network </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a series of 18 incremental strain steps by imposing a small deformation on one face , @xmath24 while holding the opposite face , @xmath25 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> we impose two types of deformations : tension ( figure  [ fig : summary]d ) and shear ( figure  [ fig : summary]e ) . in a tensile deformation </S>",
    "<S> , we allow the vertices on @xmath25 and @xmath24 to move freely in directions perpendicular to the imposed strain to allow for perpendicular contraction that is seen to occur in these experiments @xcite . in experiments of this type </S>",
    "<S> , the distance between @xmath25 and @xmath24 is on the order of centimeters and the simulated network represents a small region near the center of a sample . in shear , we do not allow the boundary nodes on @xmath25 and @xmath24 to move freely . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the shear results to cone - plate rheometer experiments , where the shear faces are bound to the rheometer . here </S>",
    "<S> , the distance between @xmath25 and @xmath24 is 109 @xmath1 m , and the simulated network is one fourth the length of the experimental sample between the boundaries . in both deformations , all other nodes , including those on the four remaining faces of the network , are free to move .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimum energy state of the network at an imposed strain @xmath26 is found using a conjugate gradient method developed by hager and zhang @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stress required to hold the network in its current configuration is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath4 denotes the area of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in figures  [ fig : strainsweep ] and [ fig : ge ] are averaged over all four extracted networks and over all 6 principle shear deformations in the sheared network and all 3 principle tensile directions in the stretched network .    </S>",
    "<S> the results from our shear cell experiments are given in figures  [ fig : strainsweep ] and [ fig : ge]a . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in figure  [ fig : ge]b , we also present the previously reported tensile modulus of large samples that are centimeters in length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : strainsweep]a shows a strain sweep from 0.5% to 100% shear strain in both the model and cone - plate rheometer experiments . at small strains , </S>",
    "<S> the stress - strain response is linear , as expected , and at larger shear strains , the stress - strain response appears cubic . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ge]a , we show that the small strain modulus scales by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the collagen density . at this time , </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to verify the power law scaling in the model since only densities of 0.5 , 1.2 , and 1.4 were observed . </S>",
    "<S> the fluorescent labeling of the network changes the polymerization properties of the network , causing it to clump at higher densities . </S>",
    "<S> we use this scaling relationship to collapse the curves in figure  [ fig : strainsweep]b . </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement between model and experiment indicates that strain stiffening due to the geometric rearrangement of the collagen fibers is enough to explain the strain stiffening seen in experiments .    , </S>",
    "<S> and the number denotes the collagen density . </S>",
    "<S> a ) unscaled results . </S>",
    "<S> note the good agreement between model and data at small and large strains . </S>",
    "<S> b ) when the curves are scaled by @xmath30 relatively good data collapse is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we denote lines of slope @xmath31 and @xmath32 to guide the eye . at large strains , </S>",
    "<S> scaling breaks down and the low density curves overtake the high density curves because at large strains , stiffness scales linearly with density . </S>",
    "<S> thus this rescaling serves mainly as a visualization tool and does not represent a true data collapse . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strainsweep],width=192 ]     is observed for the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> b ) the large strain tensile modulus from the model and from the experiments of roeder et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results differ by a factor of 2.5 , which is reasonable since the two experimental protocols were different @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ge],width=288 ]    at large strains ( @xmath33 in tension , @xmath34 in shear ) , the stress - strain curve of the model becomes linear again , though with a much steeper slope . in figure  [ fig : ge]b , we compare the large strain tensile behavior of the model to the experiments of roeder et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while our model underestimates their experimental measurement by a factor of 2.5 , we find this to be reasonable since the two experiments used different collagen protocols . in particular , different buffers were used . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strainsweep ] , we also explore the case where @xmath35 , such that we have only a network of springs connected at freely rotating pin joints . at low strains , </S>",
    "<S> the network can be deformed without exerting any stress , but at strains higher than 25% , we see that this simplification adequately describes the gel .    </S>",
    "<S> a topic of investigation explored by many is the validity of the assumption that these networks deform affinely @xcite . for brevity </S>",
    "<S> , we state only that the deformations are highly nonaffine in these simulations , as evidenced by a visual inspection of figure  [ fig : summary]d and [ fig : summary]e where it is obvious that many fibers leave the volume defined by an affine deformation .    in summary , we have presented a microstructural model of a 3d biopolymer gel using a network geometry that is based on the true network architecture . </S>",
    "<S> it differs from previous work in that we use realistic network architectures that have been extracted using the fire algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we specifically focus on the mechanics of collagen - i networks , but emphasize that this modeling approach is generalizable to other biopolymer networks . </S>",
    "<S> the model has three parameters : @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the fiber radius and tensile modulus can be measured experimentally and the model uses realistic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - link torsional spring constant must be fit to the data and we used @xmath14 . fitting this single parameter </S>",
    "<S> gives the right strain stiffening behavior for networks at three different densities at strains that vary from 0.5% to 50% . </S>",
    "<S> this result lends support to the hypothesis put forward by onck et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that strain stiffening in polymer networks , and particularly collagen - i gels , is governed by rearrangement of the gel .    </S>",
    "<S> another finding of the model is that at strains greater than 25% , the stiffness of the gel is governed almost entirely by stretching of the fibers . </S>",
    "<S> this result is relevant for collagen because cells embedded in these gels are seen to produce deformations of this order of magnitude @xcite . in modeling large systems of this type where the strains are large </S>",
    "<S> , it may be sufficient to treat each fiber as a spring rather than a wlc in order to reduce the computation time . </S>",
    "<S> this work also demonstrates that an understanding of the cross - link mechanics in these systems is critical to understanding their mechanical properties , as has been seen previously @xcite . in much of the theoretical work that has been done on random stick networks , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - links are treated either as freely rotating pin joints , or welded joints of fixed angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while these are sensible simplifying assumptions in developing a theory , they are not adequate for describing actual networks .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that this model has been designed to capture the short time scale ( @xmath37 1 hr ) behavior of the network , where it behaves as an elastic solid . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior requires that the cross - links be relatively fixed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this simplified model provides a starting point in the development of a more complete model of collagen gel . ultimately , a more sophisticated approach , such as that taken by rodney et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will be necessary to capture the full dynamic behavior of the gel , where cross - links are allowed to slip and break . </S>"
