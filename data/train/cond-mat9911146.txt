    "high-@xmath2 cuprates are regarded by many as essentially a doped mott - hubbard insulator@xcite . at half - filling such an insulator",
    "is a pure antiferromagnet with only the spin degrees of freedom not being frozen at low energy . and a metallic phase with gapless charge degrees of freedom emerge after holes are added to the filled lower hubbard band . to characterize the doped mott - hubbard insulator in the metallic regime ,",
    "two important ideas were originally introduced by anderson : spin - charge separation@xcite and unrenormalizable phase shift effect@xcite .",
    "the first one is about elementary excitations of such a system and the second one is responsible for its non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the spin - charge separation idea may be generally stated as the existence of two independent elementary excitations , charge - neutral spinon and spinless holon , which carry spin @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it can be easily visualized in a short - range resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state@xcite and has become a widely used terminology in literature , often with an additional meaning attached to it .",
    "for example , a spin - charge separation may be mathematically realized in the so - called slave - particle representation@xcite of the @xmath0 model @xmath5 where the no - double - occupancy constraint , reflecting the hubbard gap in its extreme limit , is handled by an equality @xmath6 which commutes with the hamiltonian . here",
    "one sees the close relation of the spin - charge separation and the constraint condition through the counting of the quantum numbers .",
    "but the spin - charge separation also acquires a _ new _ meaning here : if those holon ( @xmath7 ) and spinon ( @xmath8 ) fields indeed describe elementary excitations , the hole ( electron ) is no longer a stable object and must decay into a holon - spinon pair once being injected into the system as shown by fig .",
    "this instability of a quasiparticle will be later referred to as the _ deconfinement _ , in order to distinguish it from the narrow meaning of the _ spin - charge separation _ about elementary excitations .",
    "we will see later that these two are generally _ not _ the same thing .",
    "the second idea , the so - called `` unrenormalizable phase shift''@xcite , may be described as follows . in the presence of an upper hubbard band , adding",
    "a hole to the lower hubbard band could change the whole hilbert space due to the on - site coulomb interaction : the _ entire _ spectrum of momentum @xmath9 s may be shifted through the phase shift effect .",
    "it leads to the orthogonality of a bare doped hole state with its true ground state such that the quasiparticle weight @xmath10 , the key criterion for a non - fermi liquid . in general",
    ", it implies @xmath11 where @xmath12 is related to elementary excitation fields , e.g , @xmath13 in a spin - charge separation framework .",
    "such an expression means that in order for a bare hole created by @xmath14 to become low - lying elementary excitations , a _",
    "many - body _ phase shift @xmath15 must take place in the background . in momentum space , it is easy to see how such a phase shift changes the hilbert space by shifting @xmath9 values .",
    "note that @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 belong to the _ same _ set of quantized values ( for example , in a 2d square sample with size @xmath19 , the momentum is quantize at @xmath20 under the periodic boundary condition with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 integer ) .",
    "but because of a nontrivial @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 generally may no longer be described by the same set of @xmath17 s , or , in the same hilbert space , which thus constitutes an essential basis for a possible non - fermi liquid .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model serves a marvelous example in favor of the decomposition ( [ slave2 ] ) over ( [ slave ] ) .",
    "the quantitative value of the phase shift was actually determined by anderson and ren@xcite using the bethe - ansatz solution@xcite in large @xmath27 limit , and @xmath28 was shown to decay at large sample size with a finite exponent .",
    "an independent path - integral approach@xcite without using the bethe - ansatz also reaches the same conclusion which supports ( [ slave2 ] ) as the _ correct _ decomposition of _ true _ holon and spinon .",
    "another important property of the mott - hubbard insulator , which is well - known but has not been fully appreciated , is the _ bosonization _ of the electrons at half - filling .",
    "namely , the _ fermionic _ nature of the electrons completely disappears and is replaced by a _ bosonic _ one .",
    "this is one of the most peculiar features of the mott - hubbard insulator due to the strong on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "in fact , under the no - double - occupancy constraint , the @xmath0 model reduces to the heisenberg model in this limit . its ground state for any _ finite _ bipartite lattice is singlet according to marshall@xcite and the wave function is real and satisfies a _ trivial _ marshall sign rule as opposed to a much complicated `` sign problem '' associated to the fermionic statistics in a conventional fermionic system .",
    "this bosonization is the reason behind a very successful bosonic rvb description of the antiferromagnet : the variational bosonic rvb wave functions can produce strikingly accurate ground - state energy@xcite as well as elementary excitation spectrum over the whole brillouin zone@xcite . a mean - field bosonic rvb approach@xcite , known as the schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) , provides a fairly accurate and mathematically useful framework for both zero and finite temperature spin - spin correlations .",
    "starting from either the slave - boson@xcite or slave - fermion@xcite representation , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of the decomposition ( [ slave2 ] ) has been previously constructed such that the electron bosonization can be naturally realized at half - filling to restore the correct antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations . in the 1d case",
    ", this decomposition also recovers the aforementioned spinon - holon decoupling and reproduces the correct luttinger liquid behavior@xcite .",
    "even in the two - leg ladder system where holons and spinons are recombined together to form quasiparticles in the strong rung case@xcite , a many - body phase shift field in this decomposition still exists at finite doping , playing a nontrivial role .",
    "such a decomposition form can be generally written as @xmath29 it may be properly called a _ bosonization _",
    "formulation as the holon operator @xmath30 and spinon operator @xmath31 are both _ bosonic _",
    "fields here .",
    "they still satisfy the no - double - occupancy constraint @xmath32 .",
    "nature of @xmath14 is to be represented through the phase shift field @xmath33 which replaces the description of fermi surface patches _ and _ fermi - surface fluctuations in the usual bosonization language@xcite .",
    "the phase shift field in 2d is related to a nonlocal vortex - like operator by @xmath34 ( the sign @xmath35 keeps track of the marshall sign just for convenience ) with the vorticity given by@xcite @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is an arbitrary closed loop without passing any lattice site except the sit @xmath38 and the summation on the r.h.s . of ( [ thetap ] ) runs over lattice sites @xmath39 within the loop @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are spinon and holon number operators , respectively .",
    "such a vortex - like phase shift originates from the fact that a doped hole moving on an af spin background will always pick up sequential @xmath42 and @xmath43 signs , @xmath44 , first identified in ref .. these signs come from the marshall signs hidden in the af background which are scrambled by the hopping of the doped hole on its path , determined by simply counting the index @xmath45 of each spin exchanged with the hole during its hopping@xcite .",
    "the significance of such a phase string is that it represents the _ sole _ source to generate phase frustrations in the @xmath0 model ( at finite doping , the only additional signs coming from the fermionic statistics of doped holes in the original slave - fermion representation are also counted in ) .",
    "namely , the ground - state wave function would become real and there should be no `` sign problem '' only if such a phase string effect is absent ( like in the zero - doping case ) .",
    "the phase shift field in ( [ mutual ] ) precisely keeps track of such a phase string effect@xcite and therefore can be considered to be a general consequence of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) _ defines _ a unique spin - charge separation theory where the relation between the physical electron operator and the internal elementary excitations , holon and spinon , is explicitly given .",
    "the thermodynamic properties will be obtained in terms of the energy spectra of holon and spinon fields , while the physically observable quantities will be determined based on ( [ mutual ] ) where the singular phase shift field with vorticities is to play a very essential role in contrast to the conventional spin - charge separation theories in the slave - particle decompositions of ( [ slave ] ) .",
    "note that the total vorticity of ( [ thetap ] ) is always equal to @xmath46 due to the no - double - occupancy constraint such that the phase shift factor @xmath47 is single - valued .",
    "such a phase shift field will play different roles in different channels .",
    "for example , in the spin channel one has @xmath48}$ ] where the total vorticity @xmath49 it obviously vanishes at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the doping concentration ) so that the aforementioned bosonization is naturally realized . and",
    "at finite - doping , the vorticity shown in ( [ spinp ] ) reflects the recovered fermionic effect and is responsible for a doping - dependent incommensurate momentum structure@xcite in the dynamic spin susceptibility function which provides a unique reconciliation of neutron scattering and nmr measurements in the cuprates . on the other hand , in the _ singlet _ pairing channel , the phase shift field appearing in the local pairing operator will contribute to a vorticity @xmath52,\\ ] ] which decides the _ phase coherence _ of cooper pairs . according to ( [ pairp ] ) , besides a trivial @xmath53 flux quantum per site , each spinon also carries a fictitious @xmath54 flux tube . to achieve the phase coherence or superconducting condensation , @xmath55 and @xmath56 spinons have to be _ paired _ off to remove the vorticities associated with individual spinons in ( [ pairp ] ) , which then connects@xcite @xmath2 to a characteristic spinon energy scale , in consistency with the experimental result of cuprate superconductors and resolving the issue why @xmath2 is too high in usual rvb theories .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to explore the consequences of the bosonization decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) in 2d _ quasiparticle _ channel .",
    "first of all , we show that the phase shift field indeed causes the quasiparticle weight @xmath28 to vanish .",
    "namely , this spin - charge separation state _ is _ a 2d non - fermi liquid , a fact almost trivial in such a particular formulation .",
    "a surprising `` by - product '' of this phase shift field is that it also plays a role of _ confinement force _ to `` glue '' spinon and holon constituents together inside a quasiparticle , as illustrated in fig .",
    "in other words , a hole injected into this system generally does _ not _ break up into spinon - holon elementary particles , even though the background is a spinon - holon sea .",
    "such a quasiparticle may be regarded as a spinon - holon bound state or more properly a _ collective _ mode but will generally remain _ incoherent _ due to the same phase shift field .",
    "= 5.0 cm    due to the confinement , an equation - of - motion description of the quasiparticle excitation is constructed , in which the dominant `` scattering '' process is described as the `` virtual '' decay of the quasiparticle into holon - spinon composite . in the superconducting phase ,",
    "the composite nature of the quasiparticle predicts a unique non - bcs structure for the single - electron green s function which is consistent with the experimental measurements .",
    "in particular , we find the restoration of the quasiparticle coherence with regard to the incoherence in the normal state .",
    "a true deconfinement or instability of the quasiparticle only happens in the zero - doping limit where an injected hole indeed can decay into a holon and spinon pair , which provides@xcite a consistent explanation of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements@xcite .",
    "the contrast of a large band - structure - like fermi surface in the confinement phase to the four fermi - points in the deconfinement phase at zero - doping limit may provide a unique explanation for the arpes experimental measurements in cuprate superconductors . in a weakly - doped regime , a `` partial '' deconfinement of the quasiparticle between full - blown deconfinement and confinement",
    "will be reflected in the single - electron green s function which may explain the `` spin gap '' phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first briefly review the effective spin - charge separation theory based on the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) . then in sec .",
    "ii b , we show that the phase shift field leads to @xmath57 , i.e. , a non - fermi liquid state . in sec .",
    "ii c , we demonstrate how the phase shift field causes the confinement of the holon and spinon within a quasiparticle except in the zero - doping limit . in sec , ii d ,",
    "we study the single - electron propagator in both normal and superconducting states based on an equation - of - motion approach .",
    "we then discuss an underdoped case as a crossover regime from a fermi - point structure in one - hole case with the holon - spinon deconfinement to a large fermi - surface in the confinement case .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iii is devoted to discuss some of the most influential ideas proposed in literature related to the mott - hubbard insulator and high-@xmath2 cuprates and offer a unified view based on the present consistent theory .",
    "the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) determines an effective spin - charge separation theory of the @xmath0 model in which spinon and holon fields constitute the elementary particles . before proceeding to the discussion of the quasiparticle properties in next subsections ,",
    "we first briefly review some basic features of this theory based on refs ..    in the operator formalism , the phase shift field @xmath58 satisfying ( [ thetap ] ) can be explicitly written down in a specific gauge as follows@xcite @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 here @xmath62 is defined as an angle @xmath63 with @xmath64 representing the complex coordinate of a lattice site @xmath38 .    in 2d ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian based on the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) after a generalized mean - field decoupling@xcite in the @xmath0 model can be written down : @xmath65 where the holon hamiltonian @xmath66 and the spinon hamiltonian @xmath67   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sum_{ij \\sigma } j_{ij}^s \\left(e^{i\\sigma a_{ij}^h}\\right)b_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}b_{j\\sigma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in the second term of @xmath70 , @xmath71 only for @xmath72 and @xmath73 on the same sublattice sites , which originates from @xmath74 where a phase shift occurs@xcite in the spinon mean - field wavefunction and results in the same - sublattice hopping of spinons .",
    "the lattice gauge fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the specific gauge choice of ( [ phib ] ) and ( [ phih ] ) are given by @xmath77\\left(\\sum_{\\sigma}\\sigma n_{l\\sigma}^b-1\\right)\\equiv a_{ij}^s-\\phi_{ij}^0,\\ ] ] and @xmath78n_l^h.\\ ] ] in general , @xmath79 and @xmath76 can be regarded as `` mutual '' chern - simons lattice gauge fields as , for example , @xmath76 is determined by the density distribution of holons but only seen by spinons .",
    "the above effective theory is based on a rvb pairing order parameter@xcite @xmath80 which in zero - doping limit @xmath50 reduces to the well - known bosonic rvb order parameter@xcite as @xmath81 . and",
    "@xmath82 recovers the schwinger - boson mean - field hamiltonian@xcite of the heisenberg model .",
    "so this theory can well describe af correlations at half - filling . at finite doping ,",
    "the `` mutual '' chern - simons gauge fields , @xmath75 and @xmath83 , will play important roles in shaping superconductivity , magnetic and transport properties , and some very interesting similarities with cuprate superconductors have been discussed based on this model@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the slave - fermion approach@xcite , @xmath84 remains the only order parameter at finite doping , controlling the short - range spin - spin correlations as @xmath85 for nearest - neighboring @xmath38 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is noted that due to the presence of the rvb pairing ( [ deltas ] ) , the conventional gauge fluctuations@xcite are suppressed as the gauge invariance , @xmath86[b_{i\\sigma}e^{- i\\theta_i}]$ ] , is apparently broken by @xmath84 . here",
    "spinons no longer contribute to transport and are really charge - neutral particles .    in the ground state of the uniform - phase solution ( ref .",
    ") , @xmath75 and @xmath76 both become simplified : @xmath75 simply describes a @xmath87-flux per plaquette : @xmath88 since @xmath89 is suppressed due to the spinon pairing in the ground state ; @xmath76 describes a uniform flux @xmath90 due to the bose condensation of holons .",
    "self - consistently , @xmath91 [ ( [ hh ] ) ] determines a bose - condensed ground state of holons where the @xmath87 flux produced by @xmath75 merely enlarges the effective mass near the band edge by @xmath92 . on the other hand , @xmath93 in @xmath70 [ ( [ hs ] ) ] leads to a `` resonance - like '' energy structure in the spinon spectrum and the corresponding dynamic spin susceptibility function at the af vector ( @xmath87 , @xmath87 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . note that @xmath94 in fig .",
    "2 is twice bigger than the corresponding spinon energy @xmath95 .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath94 is shown in the inset .",
    "finally , the superconducting order parameter @xmath96 has a finite value ( for nearest - neighboring @xmath38 and @xmath73 ) in the ground state@xcite @xmath97 due to the bose condensation of holons as well as the pairing of spinons which leads to @xmath98 and the vortex - antivortex confinement in @xmath99 .",
    "thus the ground state is always superconducting - condensed with a pairing symmetry of d - wave - like@xcite .",
    "besides the above uniform ground state , possible non - uniform solutions characterized by the coexistence of the bose condensations of holons and spinons have been also discussed in ref . where the spinon spectrum has only a pseudo - gap .",
    "in any case , the ground state can be regarded as a spinon - holon sea , and low - lying elementary excitations are described in terms of spinons and holons .",
    "what we are mainly interested in this paper is to answer the question how a hole ( electron ) as a composite of spinon and holon behaves in this spin - charge separation state .",
    "this is one of the most fundamental questions not only because it can be directly tested in an arpes measurement , but also because it will make crucial distinction between a conventional fermi liquid and a non - fermi liquid .",
    "let us begin with the question : if this spin - charge separation state is a non - fermi liquid .",
    "= 8.0 cm      the definition of the quasiparticle weight @xmath100 at momentum @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 , and it measures the overlap of a bare hole state at momentum @xmath17 , created by @xmath25 in the ground state of @xmath103 electrons , with the ground state of @xmath104 electrons . for a fermi liquid state ,",
    "one always has @xmath105 at the fermi momentum @xmath106 .",
    "if @xmath107 for any @xmath17 , then the system is a non - fermi liquid by definition . in the following",
    "we will show that the bare hole state @xmath108 acquires an `` angular '' momentum due to the vorticities in @xmath109 in the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) .",
    "due to such a distinct symmetry , it is always orthogonal to the ground state @xmath110 , leading to @xmath10 .",
    "one can construct a `` rotational '' operation by making a transformation @xmath111 it corresponds to a simple change of reference axis for the angle function @xmath112 defined in ( [ angle ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the hamiltonians ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) are invariant since the gauge fields , in which @xmath62 appears , are obviously not changed : @xmath113 .",
    "both the ground state @xmath114 as well as single - valued @xmath115 and @xmath31 fields are apparently independent of @xmath116 . but a bare hole state will change under the transformation ( [ transf ] ) as follows : @xmath117 due to the phase shift factor @xmath47 with @xmath118 which remains an integer for a bipartite lattice ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 denote total spin and hole numbers , respectively , and n is the lattice size ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath121 indeed has a nontrivial `` angular '' momentum in contrast to @xmath114 which carries none .",
    "it is probably more transparent to see the origin of the angular momentum if one rewrites , for example , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 denote the complex coordinates of @xmath55 , @xmath56 spinons , and holons , respectively .",
    "and @xmath126 is a constant ( which is obtained by using the no - double - occupancy constraint ) .",
    "it is important to note that despite the fractional ( `` semion '' ) exponents of @xmath3 in ( [ z ] ) , it can be directly verified that the phase shift field @xmath127 remains _ single - valued _ under the no - double - occupancy constraint .",
    "generally the vortex field ( [ z ] ) introduces an extra angular momentum which can be easily identified as @xmath128 here @xmath39 is always an integer .",
    "then one has @xmath129 due to the _ orthogonal _ condition@xcite as @xmath130 [ @xmath131 , @xmath132 at finite doping ] for @xmath133 . by extending the same argument , one can quickly see that the bare hole state @xmath134 has no overlap not only with @xmath135 .",
    "so @xmath14 is more like a creation operator of a `` collective '' mode whose quantum number @xmath39 is different from a simple spinon - holon pair .",
    "the difference in symmetry between a quasiparticle and a holon - spinon pair implies that the former can not simply decay into the latter even though they share the same quantum numbers of charge and spin . in this section",
    ", we demonstrate that generally the holon and spinon constituents will be _ confined _ by the phase shift field within a quasiparticle although the background is a spinon - holon sea .",
    "intuitively such a confinement is easy to understand : if the holon and spinon constituents inside a quasiparticle could move away independently by themselves , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "3 , the vortex - phase - shift field @xmath136 left behind would cost a logarithmically _ divergent _ energy as to be shown below .",
    "but a quasiparticle state @xmath121 as a local excitation should only cost a finite energy relative to the ground state energy .",
    "such a discrepancy can be reconciled only if the holon and spinon constituents no longer behave as free elementary excitations : they have to absorb the effect of the vortex - like phase shift and by doing so make themselves bound together .",
    "let us consider @xmath137 and compute the energy cost for the vortex - like phase shift : @xmath138 we first focus on the contribution from the holon part @xmath91 [ ( [ hh ] ) ] .",
    "define @xmath139 .",
    "one has @xmath140 for any nearest neighbor link ( lm ) due to the translational symmetry .",
    "then a straightforward manipulation leads to @xmath141/2\\right\\}.\\ ] ] notice that if the ( lm ) link ( say , along @xmath142-direction ) is far away from the site @xmath38 , then one has latexmath:[$|\\theta_i(l)- \\theta_i(m)|\\rightarrow a    center of the link and the site @xmath38 and @xmath144 is the azimuth angle . then it is easy to see that the summation over those links on the r.h.s . of ( [ eh ] )",
    "will contribute as @xmath145 ( @xmath146 denotes the sample size ) .",
    "namely , the vortex - like phase shift will cost a logarithmically diverged energy if it is left alone .",
    "similar logarithmically divergent energy contributed by @xmath70 [ ( [ hs ] ) ] can be also obtained .",
    "it should be noted that the same conclusion still holds if one replace @xmath82 by the exact @xmath0 model in the representation of ( [ mutual ] ) ( ref . ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    hence the vortex - like phase shift field has to be absorbed by the holon and spinon fields in order to keep the quasiparticle energy finite . in the following ,",
    "let us illustrate how this will happen .",
    "we first use the vortex phase @xmath147 in ( [ theta ] ) as an example .",
    "let us write down the following identity @xmath148 in which @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , ... , @xmath152 are sequential lattice sites on an arbitrary path @xmath153 connecting @xmath38 and @xmath73 . and @xmath154\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha}\\alpha n_{m_s\\alpha}^b-1\\right)$ ] which is a string - like field only involving spinons on the path @xmath153 .",
    "by contrast , the line summation @xmath155 is contributed by spinons from the whole system nonlocally .",
    "note that , according to @xmath91 [ ( [ hh ] ) ] , holons see the gauge field @xmath156 in the hamiltonian and if a holon moves from site @xmath38 to @xmath73 via the same path @xmath153 it should acquire a phase factor @xmath157 which can exactly compensate the similar phase in ( [ lineh ] ) .",
    "in other words , if the vortex phase factor @xmath158 is bound to a holon to form a new composite object @xmath159 , then there will be no more vortex effect as it moves on the path @xmath153 shown in fig .",
    "3 , except for a phase string field @xmath160 left on its path , and the new object should cost only a finite energy .    similarly , for the vortex field @xmath161 in ( [ theta ] ) one can rewrite @xmath162 in which @xmath163 where the line summation runs over a sequential lattice sites on an arbitrary path @xmath164 connecting @xmath38 and @xmath165 shown in fig . 3 .",
    "and then we can similarly see that the spinon constituent of the quasiparticle also has to be bound to @xmath166 in order to compensate the logarithmically divergent energy cost by the vortex structure , and the new composite will only leave a phase string behind given by @xmath167n_{m_s}^h$ ] .    however , there is one problem in the above argument about the absorption of the vortex phase factors @xmath168 and @xmath169 by the holon and spinon constituents .",
    "namely , these two phase factors are not single - valued except in the zero doping limit .",
    "in fact , only the total phase factor @xmath170 is always well - defined and single - valued as mentioned before .",
    "it thus means that both holon and spinon constituents have to be bound to the total phase shift fields together to eliminate the divergent energy while maintain single - valued .",
    "there is another way to see this .",
    "note that @xmath171 describes the angle between the nearest - neighboring links ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) and ( @xmath174 , @xmath173 ) , it can have an uncertainty by @xmath175integer , and it is easy to see that the phase string factors @xmath176 and @xmath177 in ( [ lineh ] ) and ( [ lines ] ) are not well - defined by themselves as they are multi - valued except at @xmath178 . on the other hand , if one chooses @xmath179 in fig .",
    "3 , the mathematical ambiguity is eliminated in the total phase string field @xmath180   \\frac 1 2 \\left(\\sum_{\\alpha}\\alpha n_{m_s\\alpha}^b-1-\\sigma n^h_{m_s}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since by using the no - double - occupancy constraint , one can show @xmath181 which is an integer such that @xmath182 remains single - valued .",
    "physically , it is because a _ fermionic _",
    "quasiparticle may not decay into two _ bosonic _ holon and spinon elementary excitations in 2d .",
    "the only exception is in the _ zero - doping _ limit .",
    "we have pointed out in introduction that at half - filling the `` fermionic '' nature of the electrons essentially disappears and is replaced by a `` bosonic '' one due to the no - double - occupancy constraint .",
    "then it is not surprising that in the one - hole doped case which is adjacent to the half - filling , the deconfinement of holon - spinon can happen as a result of the electron `` bosonization '' .",
    "indeed , in the zero - doping limit @xmath183 defined in the gauge ( [ phih ] ) _ vanishes_. without @xmath184 , the original reason for inseparable @xmath185 and @xmath186 in @xmath47 is no longer present : in this case , the phase shift field @xmath47 reduces to @xmath187 which itself becomes well - defined , and can solely accompany the holon during the propagation . as for the spinon part , @xmath70 in ( [ hs ] ) reduces to the well - known sbmft hamiltonian with @xmath188 and the corresponding line summation @xmath189 is also absent in the propagator . without leading to the multi - value ambiguity , the quasiparticle will break into a spinon and a composite of holon - vortex phase which can propagate independently .",
    "more discussions of the one - hole problem can be found in the sec .",
    "how a quasiparticle behaves in a spinon - holon sea as a single entity at finite doping will be the subject of discussion in the next subsection . in the following",
    "we will make several remarks on some implications of the confinement before concluding the present subsection .",
    "first of all , we note that a quasiparticle generally remains an incoherent excitation in contrast to the coherent spinons and holons and we assume that it will not contribute significantly to either thermodynamic and dynamic properties . in the equal - time limit @xmath190",
    ", the single - electron propagator can be expressed as @xmath191 at finite @xmath192 , temporal components have to be added to the line summations , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , as well as in the phase string field @xmath195 above . even though mathematically the path @xmath196 can be chosen arbitrarily in ( [ prop1 ] ) ,",
    "a natural choice is for @xmath196 to coincide with the real path of the quasiparticle such that the line summations can be precisely compensated by the phases picked up by the holon and spinon constituents as mentioned above . in this case",
    ", all the singular phase effect will be tracked by @xmath197 which is nothing but the previously - identified phase string effect@xcite , where it has been shown that the phase string effect is nonrepairable and represents the dominant phase interference at low energy .",
    "physically , it reflects the _ fermionic _ exchange relation between the quasiparticle under consideration and those electrons in the background .",
    "such a phase string field accompanying the propagation of the quasiparticle is a many - body operator in terms of elementary holon and spinon fields . even in the one hole case , such a phase string effect results in the incoherency of the quasiparticle as has been discussed in ref . .",
    "one may also see how a fermi - surface structure is generated from the phase shift @xmath33 in some limits .",
    "for example , in the 1d case ( where @xmath198@xcite ) , since one may always define @xmath199 , the phase string factor @xmath182 in ( [ prop1 ] ) can be written as @xmath200 which produces the 1d fermi surface at @xmath201 ( here @xmath202 denotes fermi - surface fluctuations with @xmath203 which is crucial to the luttinger liquid behavior@xcite ) . in the 2d one - hole case , @xmath33 also leads to a `` remnant '' fermi surface structure in the equal time limit while gives rise to four fermi points @xmath204 _ at low energy _ as discussed in ref .. at finite doping , the doping - dependent incommensurate peaks in the dynamic spin susceptibility function has been also related to such a phase shift field@xcite . in general , the luttinger volume theorem may even be understood based on @xmath197 as it involves the counting of the background electron numbers .",
    "nevertheless , the _ precise _ fermi - surface topology will not be solely determined by the phase shift field in 2d and one must take into account of the dynamic effect .",
    "finally , a stable but incoherent quasiparticle excitation in which a pair of holon and spinon are confined means that a photoemission experiment , in which such a quasiparticle excitation can be created through `` knocking out '' an electron by a photon , does not directly probe the _ intrinsic _ information of coherent elementary excitations anymore , and the energy - momentum structure of the single - electron green s function is no longer a basis as fundamental and useful as in the case of conventional fermi liquid metals to understand superconductivity , spin dynamics , and transport properties in other channels .",
    "now imagine a bare hole is injected into the ground state of @xmath103 electrons . by symmetry ,",
    "such a state should be orthogonal to the ground state of @xmath104 electrons .",
    "its dissolution into a holon and a spinon is also prohibited by the symmetry introduced by the phase shift field [ ( [ mutual ] ) ] and the latter would otherwise cost a logarithmically divergent energy if being left alone unscreened .",
    "therefore , one has to treat a quasiparticle as an _ independent _ collective excitation in this spin - charge separation system .    involving _",
    "infinite - body _ holons and spinons , a quasiparticle can not be simply described by the mean - field theory of individual holon and spinon .",
    "the previously discussed confinement is one example of _ non - perturbative _ consequences caused by the infinite - body phase shift field .",
    "but such a confinement of the holon and spinon inside a quasiparticle will enable us to approach this problem from a different angle .    here",
    "it may be instructive to recall how a low - lying collective mode is determined in the bcs theory .",
    "in the bcs mean - field theory , quasiparticle excitations are well defined with an energy gap .",
    "but quasiparticle excitations do not exhaust all the low - lying excitations , and there exists a collective mode in the absence of long - range coulomb interaction , which may be also regarded as a `` bound '' state of a quasiparticle pair due to the _ residual _ attractive interaction . a correct way@xcite to handle this `` bound ''",
    "state is to use the _ full _ bcs hamiltonian to first write down the equation of motion for a quasiparticle pair and _ then _ apply the bcs mean - field treatment to linearize the equation to produce the gapless spectrum , which is equivalent to the rpa scheme@xcite . including the long - range coulomb interaction @xcite will turn this collective mode into the well - known plasma mode .",
    "similarly we can establish an equation - of - motion description of the quasiparticle as a `` collective mode '' , which moves on the background of the mean - field spin - charge separation state .",
    "for this purpose , let us first write down the _ full _ equation of motion of the hole operator in the heisenberg representation : @xmath205 $ ] , based on the _ exact _ @xmath0 model , either in the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) or simply in the original @xmath196-operator representation , as follows @xmath206&= & \\frac{t}{2}(1+n_i^h)\\sum_{l = nn(i)}c_{l\\sigma }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & t\\sum_{l = nn(i)}\\left(c_{l\\sigma } \\sigma s^z_i+ c_{l-\\sigma}s^{-\\sigma}_i\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath207&= & \\frac{j}{4 } c_{i\\sigma}\\sum_{l = nn(i ) } ( 1-n_l^h )   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{j}{2}\\sum_{l = nn(i)}\\left(c_{i\\sigma } \\sigma s^z_l+ c_{i-\\sigma}s^{-\\sigma}_l\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the above equations hold in the restricted hilbert space under the no - double - occupancy constraint : @xmath208 .",
    "there are many papers in literature dealing with the @xmath0 model in the @xmath196-operator representation , in which the no - double - occupancy @xmath209 is disregarded . as aconsequence",
    ", there is only a conventional _ scattering _ between the quasiparticle and spin fluctuations as suggested by ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ cj ] ) .",
    "this leads to a typical spin - fluctuation theory , which usually remains a fermi liquid theory with well - defined coherent quasiparticle excitations near the fermi surface in contrast to the @xmath57 conclusion obtained here .",
    "the problem with the spin fluctuation theory is that the crucial role of the no - double - occupancy constraint hidden in ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ cj ] ) has been completely ignored which , in combination with the rvb spin pairing , is actually the key reason resulting in a spin - charge separation state in the present effective theory of the @xmath0 model .",
    "in such a backdrop of the holon - spinon sea , the scattering terms in ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ cj ] ) will actually produce a virtual `` decaying '' process which is fundamentally different from the usual spin - fluctuation scattering in shaping the single - electron propagator .    by using the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) and the mean - field order parameter @xmath84 defined in ( [ deltas ] ) , the high - order spin - fluctuation - scattering terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ cj ] )",
    "can be `` reduced '' to the same order of linear @xmath210 , and we find @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the modified ( but not an independent ) order parameter for the hopping term introduced in ref . . in the following",
    "we will discuss some unique quasiparticle properties based on this equation .",
    "so in the spin - charge separation ( mean - field ) background , the leading order effect of the `` scattering '' terms correspond to the decay of the quasiparticle : the terms in the second line of ( [ cc ] ) clearly indicate the tendency for the quasiparticle to break up into holon and spinon constituents .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional _ scatterings _ between the quasiparticle and spin fluctuations , as ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ cj ] ) would have suggested .",
    "generally , the quasiparticle is expected to have an intrinsic broad spectral function extended over the whole energy range @xmath213 because of the decomposition process .",
    "but the presence of the phase factor @xmath214 in these `` decaying '' terms of ( [ cc ] ) prevents a real decay of the quasiparticle since such a vortex field would cost a logarithmically divergent energy as has been discussed before .",
    "thus , even in the case of ( [ energy ] ) , the decaying of a quasiparticle remains only a virtual process which is an another way to understand the confinement discussed in sec .",
    "ii c.    without the `` decaying '' terms , the equation - of - motion ( [ cc ] ) would become closed with an eigen spectrum in momentum - energy space ( besides a constant which can be absorbed into the chemical potential ) : @xmath215 with @xmath216 generally the `` decaying '' terms do not contribute to a coherent @xmath17-dependent correction due to the nature of the holon and spinon excitations as well as the `` smearing '' caused by @xmath217 in ( [ cc ] ) .",
    "but in the ground state , which is also superconducting , the `` decaying '' terms in ( [ cc ] ) do produce a coherent contribution due to the composite nature of the quasiparticle which will modify the solution of the equation - of - motion .      in the mean - field ground state ,",
    "the bosonic holons are bose condensed with @xmath218 and the superconducting order parameter @xmath219 ( see sec . ii a ) .",
    "the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) then implies that the electron @xmath196-operator may be rewritten in two parts : @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 with @xmath223 .",
    "correspondingly , a coherent term will emerge from the `` decaying '' terms in ( [ cc ] ) which is linear in @xmath224 : @xmath225 in obtaining the r.h.s . of the above expression , the superconducting order parameter",
    "defined in ( [ sc ] ) is used .",
    "note that the @xmath192-scattering term in ( [ cc ] ) gives rise to a term @xmath226 which can be absorbed by the chemical potential @xmath227 added to the equation .",
    "then one finds @xmath228 where the connection between @xmath229 and @xmath230 has been assumed to be in high order and thus is neglected in the leading order approximation to get a closed form in linear @xmath229 and @xmath224 .",
    "finally , introducing the bogoliubov transformation in the momentum space @xmath231 we find that ( [ cbar ] ) can be reduced to @xmath232 where @xmath233 represents the creation operator of an eigenstate of quasiparticle excitations with the energy spectrum @xmath234 here @xmath235 is defined by @xmath236 with @xmath237 . like in the bcs theory , @xmath238/2 $ ] and @xmath239/2 $ ] .",
    "the large `` fermi surface '' is defined by @xmath240 and @xmath241 then represents the energy gap opened at the fermi surface .",
    "note that @xmath235 changes sign as @xmath242 with @xmath243 , by noting @xmath244 in ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "it means that @xmath235 has opposite signs at @xmath245 and @xmath246 , indicating a d - wave symmetry near the fermi surface .",
    "in fact , since the pairing order parameter @xmath247 is d - wave - like@xcite , @xmath248 should be always d - wave - like with node lines @xmath249 according to ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "comparing to the conventional bcs theory with d - wave order parameter , there are several distinct features in the present case .",
    "first of all , besides the d - wave quasiparticle spectrum illustrated in fig . 4 by the `` v '' shape lines along the fermi surface , there exists a discrete spinon excitation level at @xmath250 ( horizontal line in fig .",
    "4 ) which leads to @xmath251@xmath252 ( if @xmath253@xmath252 ) magnetic peak at @xmath254 as reviewed in sec .",
    "ii a. this latter spin collective mode is _ independent _ of the quasiparticle excitations at the mean - field level .",
    "= 8.0 cm    secondly , even though the superconducting _ order parameter _ @xmath255 and the _ energy gap _ @xmath235 in the quasiparticle spectrum have the same symmetry : both are d - wave - like , they can not be simply identified as the same quantity as in the bcs theory .",
    "for example , while @xmath256 apparently scales with the doping concentration @xmath51 ( @xmath257 ) and vanishes at @xmath258 , the gap @xmath235 defined in ( [ gap ] ) is not , and can be _ extrapolated _ to a finite value in the zero doping limit where @xmath259 .",
    "it means @xmath260 at @xmath50 , whereas the bcs theory predicts a constant @xmath261 ( d - wave case@xcite ) .",
    "the result ( [ pred1 ] ) is consistent with the arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "thirdly , the quasiparticle gains a `` coherent '' part @xmath262 which should behave similarly to the conventional quasiparticle in the bcs theory as it does not further decay at @xmath263 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in this sense",
    ", the quasiparticle partially restores its coherence in the superconducting state .",
    "such a coherent part will disappear as a result of vanishing superfluid density . according to ( [ c ] )",
    "one may rewrite the single - particle propagator as @xmath264 where @xmath265 denotes the propagator of @xmath229-particles with omitting the crossing term between @xmath266 and @xmath267 which is assumed negligible .",
    "then @xmath268 emerges as the `` coherent '' part of the green s function in superconducting state against the `` normal '' part @xmath269 : @xmath270 correspondingly , the total spectral function as the imaginary part of @xmath271 in our theory can be written as @xmath272 so at @xmath273 , even though @xmath274 does not scale with @xmath275 , the superconducting coherent part @xmath276 vanishes altogether , with @xmath277 reduces to the normal part @xmath278 at @xmath279 .",
    "finally , in the present case , @xmath280 as a normal part has nothing to do with the procedure that leads to the spectrum ( [ ek ] ) with a d - wave gap , which is different from the slave - boson approach where the fermionic spinons are all paired up such that even the part of the spectral function corresponding to @xmath281 should also look like in a d - wave pairing state",
    ". due to the sum rule @xmath282 , the `` normal '' part @xmath283 is expected to be sort of suppressed by the emergence of the `` coherent '' @xmath284 part , but since the latter is in order of @xmath51 , @xmath285 should be still dominant away from the fermi surface at small doping .",
    "it implies that even in superconducting state , a normal - state dispersion represented by the peak of @xmath285 may still be present as a `` hump '' in the total spectral function @xmath277 .",
    "recent arpes experiments have indeed indicated@xcite the existence of a `` hump '' in the spectral function which clearly exhibits normal - state dispersion in the fermi - surface portions near the areas of ( @xmath286 , @xmath287 ) and ( @xmath287 , @xmath286 ) where the d - wave gap is maximum .      in the normal state , without any coherent contribution ,",
    "the scattering terms in ( [ cc ] ) only give rise to the virtual process for a quasiparticle to decay into the holon - spinon pairs .",
    "based on ( [ cc ] ) , the propagator can be determined according to the following standard equation of motion for the single - particle green s function @xmath288 : @xmath289c^{\\dagger}_{j\\sigma}(0)\\rangle -\\theta(-t)\\langle c^{\\dagger}_{j\\sigma}(0)[h_{t - j } , c_{i\\sigma}(t)]\\rangle - i\\delta ( t)\\delta_{i , j}.\\ ] ] if we simply neglect the scattering terms in zero - order approximation , a closed form for @xmath271 can be obtained in momentum - energy space : @xmath290    here the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath291 [ defined in ( [ epsilon ] ) ] is essentially the same as the original _ band - structure _ spectrum except for a factor of @xmath292 enhancement in effective mass .",
    "it is noted that in the @xmath0 model if the hopping term described by the tight - binding model is replaced by a more realistic band - structure model , like introducing the next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms , the above conclusion about the factor-2 enhancement of the effective mass still holds , in good agreement with arpes experiments@xcite . here",
    "the reason for the mass enhancement is quite simple : at each step of hopping , the probability is roughly one half for a hole not to change the surrounding singlet spin configuration , which in turn reduces the `` bandwidth '' of the quasiparticle by a factor of two .",
    "the expression ( [ gns ] ) shows a `` quasiparticle '' peak at @xmath293 and defines a large `` fermi surface '' as an equal - energy contour at @xmath240 . here",
    "@xmath294 is determined such that @xmath295@xcite .",
    "so the `` fermi surface '' structure should look like similar to that of a non - interacting band - structure fermion system as long as the virtual decaying process in ( [ cc ] ) does not fundamentally alter it .",
    "[ as mentioned before , we do not expect such `` decaying '' terms to significantly modify the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath296 since , for example , the spinon no longer has a well - defined spectrum in momentum space ( see sec . ii a ) and in particular , the vortex phase @xmath217 in ( [ cc ] ) will further `` smear out '' the @xmath17-dependent correction , if any , from ( [ cc ] ) . ]",
    "so far we have not discussed the finite life - time effect of a quasiparticle due to the `` decaying '' terms in ( [ cc ] ) . even though the true break - up of a quasiparticle is prevented by the phase shift field as discussed before , the virtual decaying process should remain a very strong effect since the phase shift field only cost a logarithmically divergent energy at a large length scale .",
    "the corresponding confinement force is rather weak and the virtual decaying process should become predominant locally to cause an intrinsic broad feature in the spectral function at high energy .",
    "such a broad structure reflecting the decomposition in the one - hole case has been previously discussed in ref . .",
    "at finite doping , how the `` decaying '' effect shapes the broadening of the quasiparticle peak will be a subject to be investigated elsewhere .",
    "the existence of a large fermi surface , coinciding with the _ non - interacting _ band - structure one , can be attributed to the integrity of the quasiparticle due to the confinement of spinon and holon .",
    "but as pointed out in sec .",
    "ii c , such a confinement will disappear in the zero - doping limit .",
    "the fermi surface structure will then be drastically changed .    in this limit",
    ", the single - electron propagator may be expressed in the following _ decomposition _",
    "form @xmath297 where @xmath298 and @xmath299 without the multi - value problem because @xmath184 in ( [ phih ] ) vanishes and @xmath300 becomes well - defined as discussed in sec .",
    "ii c. at @xmath50 , @xmath70 in ( [ hs ] ) reduces to the sbmft hamiltonian with @xmath188 and @xmath301 becomes the conventional schwinger - boson propagator .",
    "such a deconfinement can be also seen from the equation of motion ( [ cc ] ) by noting that @xmath302 can be absorbed by @xmath7 , while @xmath303 , so that the scattering term becomes a pure decaying process for the quasiparticle without any confining force . due to such a true decaying ,",
    "equation ( [ cc ] ) actually describes in real time the first step towards dissolution for the quasiparticle .",
    "in particular , the large fermi surface structure originated from the _ bare _ hopping term in ( [ cc ] ) will no longer appear in the decomposition form of the electron propagator ( [ decomp ] ) , where the residual fermi surface ( points ) will solely come from the oscillating part of the phase shift field @xmath300 in @xmath304 .",
    "the single - electron propagator for the one - hole case has been discussed in detail in ref .. here the large fermi surface is gone except for four _ fermi points _ at @xmath305 with the rest part looking like all `` gapped '' .",

    "once the density of holes becomes finite , the `` confining force '' should remain _ weak _ at small doping , and one expects the virtual `` decaying '' process in ( [ cc ] ) to contribute significantly at weakly doping to bridge a continuum evolution between the fermi - point structure in the zero - doping limit to a full large fermi surface at larger doping .",

    "_ quasiparticle : spinon - holon confinement .",
    "_ in conventional spin - charge separation theories based on slave - particle schemes , a quasiparticle does not exist at all : it always breaks up and decays into spinon - holon elementary excitations .",
    "this deconfinement has been widely perceived as a logical consequence of the spin - charge separation in literature .",
    "but in the present paper , we have shown that the phase shift field actually _ confines _ the spinon - holon constituents ( at least at finite doping ) , which means the integrity of a quasiparticle is still preserved even in a spin - charge separation state .",
    "it may be considered as a @xmath329 version of quark confinement , but with a twist : the stable quasiparticle as a collective mode is generally not a _ coherent _ elementary excitation since during its propagation the phase shift field also induces a nonlocal phase string on its path . in other words ,",
    "the quasiparticle here is not a landau quasiparticle anymore .",
    "the confinement and nonrepairable phase string effect both reflect the fermionic nature of the quasiparticle , namely , the _ fermionic _ quasiparticle can not simply decay into _ bosonic _ spinon and holon ; and the phase string effect comes from sequential signs due to the _ exchange _ between the propagating quasiparticle and the spinon - holon background  the latter after all is composed of fermionic electrons in the original representation .",
    "the issue of the possible confinement of spinon and holon was already raised by laughlin@xcite along a different line of reasoning .",
    "he has also discussed numerical and experimental evidence that the spinon - holon may be seen , more sensibly , in high - energy spectroscopy like the way quarks are seen in particle physics . in the recent su(2 )",
    "gauge theory@xcite , an attraction between spinon and holon to form a bound state due to gauge fluctuations is also assumed in order to explain the arpes data .",
    "but in the present work the essential point is that the holons and spinons are not confined in the ground state but are only bound in quasiparticles as a kind of incoherent ( many - body ) excitations which have no overlap with elementary holon and spinon excitations as guaranteed by symmetry .",
    "these incoherent quasiparticle excitations should not have any significant contribution to the thermodynamic properties ( at least above @xmath2 ) . at short distance and high - energy , the composite nature of a quasiparticle",
    "will become dominant which may well explain the broad _ intrinsic _ structure in the spectral function observed in the arpes experiments .",
    "the composite structure of the quasiparticle can even show up at low - energy when one navigates through different circumstances like the superconducting condensation , underdoping regime , etc .",
    ", with some unique features different from the behavior expected from landau quasiparticles",
    ".    _ fractional statistics .",
    "_ laughlin@xcite had made a compelling argument right after the proposal of the spin - charge separation that the holon and spinon should carry fractional statistics , by making an analogy of the spin liquid state with a fractional quantum hall state .",
    "even though the absence of the time - reversal symmetry - breaking evidence in experiment does not support the original version of fractional statistics ( anyon ) theories@xcite , the essential characterization of fractional statistics for the singlet spin liquid state is , surprisingly , present in our theory in the form of the phase string effect as discussed in ref .. but no explicit time - reversal symmetry is broken in this description@xcite .",
    "a fractional statistics may sound strange as we have been talking about `` bosonization '' throughout the paper .",
    "but as pointed out in ref .",
    ", if the phase shift field @xmath58 is to be `` absorbed '' by the bosonic spinon and holon fields , then the expression ( [ mutual ] ) can be regarded as a slave - semion decomposition with the new `` spinon '' and `` holon '' fields being `` bosonic '' among themselves but satisfying a _ mutual _ fractional statistics between the spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the origin of mutual statistics can be traced back to the nonrepairable phase string effect induced by a hole in the antiferromagnetic spin background . at finite doping",
    ", the order parameter @xmath84 in ( [ deltas ] ) actually describes the rvb pairing of spinons with _ mutual - statistics _ which reduces to the bosonic rvb only in the half - filling limit .",
    "furthermore , in the bosonic representation of ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) the lattice chern - simons fields , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , precisely keep track of mutual statistics@xcite , which are crucial to various peculiar properties exhibited in the model .    _ gauge theory . _ based on the slave - boson decomposition , it has been shown@xcite that the gauge coupling is the most important low - energy interaction associated with spin - charge deconfinement there . the anomalous linear - temperature resistivity@xcite has become the hallmark for anomalous transport phenomenon based on the scattering between charge carriers and gauge fluctuations . in the present theory ,",
    "the holons are also subject to strong random flux fluctuations , in terms of the effective holon hamiltonian ( [ hs ] ) , in a uniform normal state where it leads@xcite to the linear - t resistivity in consistency with the monte carlo numerical calculation@xcite .",
    "other anomalous transport properties related to the cuprates may be also systematically explained in such a simple gauge model based on some effective analytic treatment@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the slave - boson gauge theory , however , the spinon part does not participate in the transport phenomenon due to the rvb condensation ( @xmath98 ) persisting over the normal state , and besides the chern - simons gauge fields @xmath330 , the conventional gauge interaction between spinons and holons is suppressed because of it .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath87-flux phase@xcite and commensurate flux phase@xcite in the mean - field slave - boson theory , and the recent su(2 ) gauge theory@xcite at small doping have a very close connection with the present approach : a _ fermionic _ spinon in the presence of @xmath87 flux per plaquette is actually a precursor to become a _ bosonic _ one at half - filling under the lattice and no - double - occupancy constraint . in ref .",
    ", how such a statistics - transmutation occurs has been discussed , and in fact the bosonization decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) was first obtained there based on the fermionic flux phase . in spite of physical proximity ,",
    "however , the detailed mathematical structure of gauge description@xcite for the fermionic flux phase and the present bosonic spinon description are obviously rather different .",
    "_ superconducting mechanism .",
    "originally conjectured that the superconducting condensation may occur once the rvb spin pairs in the insulating phase start to move like cooper pairs in the doped case .",
    "the superconducting condensation in the present theory indeed follows suit .",
    "but there is an important subtlety here . since the rvb paring order parameter @xmath84 covers the normal state as well",
    ", there must be an another factor controlling the superconducting transition : the _ phase coherence_. indeed , the vortex phase @xmath331 appearing in the superconducting order parameter ( [ sc ] ) is the key to ensure the _ phase coherence _ at a relatively low temperature compatible to a characteristic _ spin _ energy@xcite .",
    "in other words , the phase coherence discussed by emery and kivelson@xcite is realized by the _ phase shift field _ in the present theory which effectively resolves the issue why @xmath2 is too high in previous rvb theories .",
    "furthermore , the interlayer pair tunneling mechanism@xcite for superconductivity is also relevant to the present theory from a different angle . recall that the quasiparticle does exist in the present theory but is always _ incoherent _ just like the blocking of a coherent single - particle interlayer hopping conjectured in ref .. on the other hand",
    ", a pair of quasiparticles in the singlet channel can recover the _ coherency _ due to the cancellation of the frustration caused by the phase string effect .",
    "thus if one is to construct a phenomenological theory based on the _ electron _ representation , the superconductivity can be naturally viewed as due to an _ in - plane _ kinetic mechanism@xcite .    _ phase string and @xmath332 gauge theory _",
    "as pointed out at the beginning of this section , our whole theory is built on the phase string effect identified in the @xmath0 model .",
    "namely , the main phase frustration induced by doping is characterized by a sequence of signs @xmath333 on a closed path @xmath196 where @xmath334 denotes the index of spins exchanged with a hole at a link @xmath335 during its hopping .",
    "thus , instead of working in the vortex representation of ( [ mutual ] ) where the singular phase string effect has been built into the wave functions with the non - singular part described by the chern - simons - like lattice gauge fields@xcite , one may also directly construct a 2 + 1 @xmath332 gauge theroy@xcite to deal with the singular phase string @xmath333 .",
    "a discrete @xmath332 gauge theory here seems the most natural description of the phase string effect as the sole phase frustration in the @xmath0 model , in contrast to the conventional continuum gauge field description@xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize the close connection between the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity as both occur in a unified rvb background controlled by @xmath336 .",
    "the relation between the af insulating phase and the superconducting phase here is much more intrinsic than in conventional approaches to the @xmath0 model .",
    "especially , the coexistence of holon and spinon bose condensations in the underdoped regime@xcite makes a group theory description of such a phase , in a fashion of the so(5 ) theory@xcite , become possible but with an important modification : inhomogeneity must play a crucial role here in the bose condensed holon and spinon fields in order to describe this underdoped regime .",
    "detailed investigation along this line will be pursued elsewhere .",
