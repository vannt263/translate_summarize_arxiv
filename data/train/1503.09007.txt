    "the investigation of the @xmath5 meson mass in nuclear matter and the strength of its inelastic interaction with nucleons has received considerable interest in recent years ( see , for example , [ 121 ] ) in the context of obtaining valuable information both on the partial restoration of chiral symmetry at a finite density and on the behavior of the @xmath6 anomaly in the nuclear medium as well as in view of the possible existence of such exotic nuclear systems as @xmath5-mesic nuclei .",
    "recent inclusive @xmath5 photoproduction measurements of the cbelsa / taps collaboration show [ 20 , 21 ] that the @xmath5-nucleus optical potential @xmath7 is @xmath8 mev , which is equal to the @xmath5 meson mass shift in the medium , and @xmath9 mev at the saturation density @xmath10 and for average @xmath5 momenta of @xmath11 1 gev / c .",
    "the @xmath5 in - medium mass shift , determined by the cbelsa / taps collaboration , is very similar to that of -37 mev , calculated within the quark meson coupling model [ 79 ] , and disfavors the larger @xmath5 mass shifts , downwards by up to 80200 mev , predicted in [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 1215 ] .",

    "it can be seen that there are clear correlations between the peaks in the @xmath0 kinetic energy distributions , shown in these figures , and the @xmath0 in - medium mass shift , namely : the peaks move to lower energies with decreasing this shift down to -150 mev .",

    "the highest sensitivity to this shift we have for the photon energy range of 1.52.2 gev , but because of the expected higher statistics the largest bin of 1.32.6 gev is preferred .",
    "the reason for the different slopes in the correlations shown in figure 5 is the following .",
    "let us start with the initial photon energy interval of 1.52.2 gev .",
    "if we increase upper energy limit to 2.6 gev , maintaining the lower one of 1.5 gev , we add , as calculations showed , events mainly with low @xmath0 kinetic energies from the kinematic branch with @xmath0 mesons going backward and protons going forward in cm system .",

    "this shifts the maxima again to higher kinetic energy values .",
    "therefore , a comparison above results with the experimentally determined peak position in the @xmath0 kinetic energy distribution under consideration will allow one to determine a possible @xmath0 meson mass shift in cold nuclear matter . it should be noted that an analogous possibility was recently realized for the @xmath222 mesons in [ 31 ] .     vacuum kinetic energy for photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons in the full solid angle off the carbon target nucleus from primary channel ( 1 ) in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220 as well as feeling and not seeing a momentum - dependent nuclear potential ( 8) inside the nucleus ( solid and dashed lines ) , respectively , after averaging over the incident photon energy range of 1.52.2 gev in the scenario without @xmath0 in - medium mass shift.,width=453 ]    in addition , we have investigated the influence of the scalar momentum - dependent potential ( 8) , which the outgoing participant proton sees inside the carbon nucleus , on the @xmath4 yield .",
    "figure 6 shows that the inclusion of this potential results in a reduction of the @xmath0 kinetic energy distribution on carbon by a factor of about 1.3 at low @xmath0 kinetic energies as well as in a shift of the peak of this distribution by about of 50 mev to higher energies .",
    "this is due to the fact that in a ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction on a nuclear target the low - energy @xmath0 mesons are produced in the kinematics of our interest together with the high - energy protons to balance the momentum of the incident photon beam ( see the second footnote given above ) . in view of equations ( 7 ) and ( 8)",
    ", these protons feel in the interior of the nucleus a repulsive potential , which leads to the above effects .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that to extract the reliable information on the @xmath0 in - medium modification from the analysis of the measured @xmath0 kinetic energy distributions on nuclei , like those just considered , it is important to account for the impact of the momentum - dependent nuclear potential on the participant protons emerging from the nucleus .",
    "mesons in the full phase space off the carbon target nucleus from the primary channel ( 1 ) in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220 and feeling inside the nucleus a momentum - dependent nuclear potential ( 8) , in the scenario with an @xmath0 in - medium mass shift at normal nuclear density of -50 mev.,width=453 ]     kinetic energy for photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons in the full solid angle off a free target proton at rest in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220 , after averaging over the incident photon energy ranges of 1.451.8 gev and 1.452.2 gev ( solid and dotted lines , respectively).,width=453 ]     mesons in the full phase space off a free target proton at rest in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220.,width=453 ]    in figure 7 we show the excitation function for photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons in the full phase space off @xmath2c from the primary channel ( 1 ) in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220 .",
    "it was calculated on the basis of equation ( 19 ) in the scenario with @xmath0 in - medium mass shift @xmath24 mev , which we believe is close to the reality [ 21 ] .",
    "it is seen that the calculation shows a peak at an incident photon energy of 1.7 gev . in view of the expected data from the cbelsa /",
    "taps experiment , the results presented in figure 7 can be also used as an additional tool to those given before for determining the possible @xmath0 in - medium mass shift .    finally , we consider the kinetic energy distribution and excitation function for @xmath0 mesons produced on a free target proton being at rest in reaction ( 1 ) in coincidence with protons , going into the laboratory polar angular range of @xmath219@xmath220 .",
    "they were calculated on the basis of equation ( 28 ) , and are given in figures 8 and 9 , respectively .",
    "the importance of these predictions lies in the fact that their comparison with the corresponding data from the cbelsa / taps experiment will provide a simple consistency check of the data analysis and our calculations .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the considered above exclusive observables can be useful to help determine the @xmath0 in - medium mass shift in cold nuclear matter .",
    "with the aim of studying a possible shift of the @xmath0 meson mass in the nuclear medium we have developed in this article an approach for the description of the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction on nuclei near the threshold in the kinematical conditions of the crystal barrel / taps experiment , recently performed at elsa .",
    "the approach accounts for both a direct knock out process and a two - step mechanism where the knock out reaction ( @xmath3 , @xmath70 ) with @xmath223 is followed by an elastic rescattering of an intermediate nucleon @xmath224 from another nucleon in the medium , leading to the emission of the detected proton , as well as different scenarios of the @xmath0 in - medium mass shift .",
    "calculations within this approach have been performed for the @xmath2c(@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reaction for which the respective data were collected by the cbelsa / taps collaboration .",
    "it was found that the considered two - step mechanism plays a minor role in @xmath4 photoproduction off a carbon target in the chosen kinematics and , hence , it can be ignored here .",
    "the calculated exclusive @xmath0 kinetic energy distributions from the primary @xmath1 channel show a strong sensitivity to the @xmath0 in - medium mass shift in the studied ranges of the initial photon energy .",
    "this provides the opportunity to determine it from a direct comparison of the results of our calculations with the upcoming data from the respective cbelsa / taps experiment .",
    "it was also shown that the above distributions are strongly sensitive as well to the momentum - dependent optical potential , which the outgoing participant proton sees inside the carbon nucleus and , therefore , it should be accounted for in the analysis of these data with the purpose to get information on the @xmath0 in - medium mass shift in cold nuclear matter .",
