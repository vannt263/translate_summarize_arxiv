    "in this paper , we obtain an upper bound for the number of solutions of the equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a complex parameter , and @xmath2 is a real parameter .",
    "our motivation for doing so is that solutions of ( [ lens2 ] ) in fact correspond to virtual images observed when the light from a distant source passes near an isothermal , ellipsoidal galaxy . indeed , using the complex formulation of the thin - lens approximation ( @xcite ) , the lensing equation is calculated by finding the cauchy transform of the mass distribution projected to the `` lens plane '' .",
    "this was carried out in @xcite with the following result ( we also sketch the derivation in the last section for the reader s convenience ) .",
    "@xmath3    here , we take the principal branch of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real constants depending on the elliptical projection of the galaxy onto the lens plane , and @xmath7 is the position of the source ( projected to the lens plane ) , and values of @xmath8 which satisfy ( [ lens1 ] ) give positions of the observed images . changing variables to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 puts ( [ lens1 ] ) into the form of equation ( [ lens2 ] ) while preserving the number of solutions .",
    "we should mention that the anti - analytic potential in the lensing equation considered here ( and , also , in @xcite and @xcite ) differs from the potential in the lensing equation in the model often used by astrophysicists ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , where the projected mass density is supported in the entire complex plane .",
    "both models use the `` isothermal '' density proportional to @xmath12 on ellipses @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 fixed ) .",
    "the model considered here that yields equation ( [ lens1 ] ) assumes that the density is zero for all @xmath16 greater than some value ( see appendix ) . letting the density have infinite support",
    "assumes that the galaxy has infinite mass and fills the universe , yet it is the simplest way to avoid giving the galaxy a `` sharp edge '' and astronomers have found that the model behaves reasonably in the region where the lensed images occur .",
    "we consider the model with physically realistic compact support but less realistic `` sharp edge '' for a mathematical reason : in that setting , lensed images described by solutions of equation ( [ lens2 ] ) correspond to zeros of a _ harmonic _ function ( we note that models with `` sharp edges '' have been considered by astrophysicists as well , cf .",
    "the recent preprints @xcite and @xcite ) .    for gravitational lenses consisting of @xmath17 point masses , mao , petters , and witt @xcite suggested ( 1997 ) that the bound for the number of images was linear in @xmath17 ( bezout s theorem provides a bound quadratic in @xmath17 ) .",
    "rhie refined this in 2001 , conjecturing that a gravitational lens consisting of @xmath17 point masses can not create more than @xmath18 images of a given source @xcite . in 2003 , she constructed point - mass configurations for which these bounds are attained @xcite .",
    "the first author and g. neumann @xcite settled her conjecture by giving a bound of @xmath19 zeros for harmonic mappings of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is rational of deg @xmath22 .",
    "( see @xcite for the exposition and further details . )",
    "solutions of ( [ lens2 ] ) are zeros of a _ transcendental _ harmonic function , so extending the techniques used in @xcite will require some care ( a priori , it is not even clear that the number of zeros is finite , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "still , our approach draws on the same two main results : ( i ) the argument principle generalized to harmonic functions and ( ii ) the fatou theorem from complex dynamics regarding the attraction of critical points . in the next section ,",
    "we will formulate ( i ) .",
    "( ii ) will have to be modified for our purposes , so ideas from complex dynamics are worked from scratch into the proof of lemma [ sp ] in the third section .",
    "* acknowledgement : * we would like to thank walter bergweiler , alex eremenko , and charles r. keeton for stimulating discussions and for sharing some of their unpublished work with us .",
    "in order to state the generalized argument principle ( see @xcite for a complete exposition and proof ) , we need to define the order of a zero or pole of a harmonic function .",
    "a harmonic function @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are analytic functions , is called _ sense - preserving _ at @xmath26 if the jacobian @xmath27 for every @xmath28 in some punctured neighborhood of @xmath26 .",

    "we note that if @xmath29 is sense - reversing on a sufficiently small circle around the pole , then the order of the pole will be negative .",
