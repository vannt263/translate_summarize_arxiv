    "it is important to notice that this random field has slowly decaying correlations:@xmath54    for @xmath55 the thermodynamic limit does not exist , and in fact@xmath56 for @xmath35 the variance grows of course like @xmath57 in the bulk .",
    "the harmonic surface is therefore localized for @xmath58 but not for @xmath59    many of these properties carry over to non - harmonic cases with a convex and symmetric interaction function @xmath60 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . of particular importance",
    "is that there is a generalization of the representation ( [ rwrepresentation])@xmath61 the helffer - sjstrand representation , see @xcite .",
    "the random walk @xmath62 has to be replaced by a random walk in a dynamically changing random environment . using this representation ,",
    "many of the results for the harmonic case can be generalized to the case of a convex @xmath63 although often not in a quantitatively as precise form as in the harmonic case . for a probabilistic description of the helffer - sjstrand representation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main topic of this paper are effects arising from interactions of the random surface @xmath64 with a `` wall '' .",
    "the simplest case of such a wall is the configuration @xmath65 there are many type of interactions which had been considered in the literature , both in physics and in mathematics .",
    "the simplest one is a local attraction of the surface to this wall .",
    "it turns out that an arbitrary weak attraction localizes the random field in a strong sense , and in all dimensions .",
    "this will be discussed in a precise way in section [ chap_pinning ] .",
    "interesting localization - delocalization phenomena may occur when mixed attractive and repulsive interactions are present , with phase transitions depending on the parameters regulating the strength of the interactions .",
    "naturally , these phenomena are best understood for the one - dimensional case .",
    "a simple example is the following one , which is discussed in details in @xcite : let @xmath66 be a discrete time @xmath10-valued , and tied - down , simple random walk , i.e. @xmath67 is simply the uniform distribution on all such paths which satisfy @xmath68 introducing an arbitrary pinning to the wall in the form@xmath69 p_{n}\\left (   \\phi\\right )   , \\;\\beta>0\\ ] ] strongly localizes the `` random string '' , i.e. @xmath70 holds for all @xmath71 furthermore , the correlations @xmath72 are exponentially decaying in @xmath73 uniformly in @xmath74 these facts are easily checked .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the string is confined to be on one side of the wall , the situation is completely different .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 then there is a critical @xmath77 such that the above localization property holds for @xmath78 but not for @xmath79 where the path measure converges , after brownian rescaling , to the brownian excursion . for a proof of this",
    "so called `` wetting transition '' , see @xcite . more precise information has been obtained recently in this one - dimensional situation in @xcite .",
    "there are similar phase transitions for more complicated models .",
    "some of them will be discussed in section [ chap_entropicrep ] and section [ chap_copolymer ] .",
    "we begin in the next section by discussing the pinning effect alone mainly in the difficult two - dimensional case .",
    "-5 mm    we consider now a gradient field ( [ def_pv ] ) , but we modify it by introducing an attractive local pinning to the wall @xmath80 this is often done by modifying the hamiltonian in the following way : let @xmath81 be symmetric and with compact support .",
    "then we put@xmath82 evidently , the corresponding finite volume gibbs measure favours surfaces which have the tendency to stick close to the wall .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is a much weaker attraction than in a so - called massive field , where one takes @xmath21 to be convex , for instance @xmath83 a formally slightly easier model can be obtained by not changing the hamiltonian , but replacing the lebesgue measure as the reference measure by a mixture of the lebesgue measure and a dirac measure at @xmath84 this corresponds to the following probability measure on @xmath85@xmath86 \\prod_{x\\in v}\\left (   d\\phi_{x}+\\varepsilon\\delta_{0}\\left (   d\\phi_{x}\\right ) \\right )   , \\;\\varepsilon>0.\\label{def_pv - pinned}\\ ] ] this measure can be obtained from measures defined by the hamiltonian ( [ bump - pinning ] ) via an appropriate limiting procedure .",

    "the case of @xmath93   } \\left (   x\\right )   $ ] is discussed in @xcite .",
    "probably , more general cases could be handled with the help of the brydges - frhlich - spencer random walk representation ( see @xcite ) , but the results presented here have not been derived in this more general case . for the sake of simplicity , we stick here to the @xmath94-pinning case ( [ def_pv - pinned ] ) .",
    "the above representation easily leads to a representation of the covariances of the pinned field .",
    "this is particularly simple in the harmonic case @xmath95 where one gets@xmath96 the problem is therefore reduced to a problem of a random walk among random traps : the distribution @xmath97 defines a random trapping configuration , let s denote it by @xmath98 i.e. @xmath99 and the covariances of our pinned measure are given in terms of the discrete green s function among these random traps which are killing the random walk when it enters one of these traps .",
    "a difficult point is a precise analysis of the distribution of @xmath98 and a crucial step is a comparison with bernoulli measures .",
    "the two - dimensional case is the most difficult one . in three and more dimensions ,",
    "a comparison of the distribution of @xmath100 with a bernoulli measure is quite easy .",
    "it turns out that the pinning localizes the field in a strong sense .",
    "first of all , the variance of the variables stay bounded as @xmath101 secondly , there is exponential decay of the covariances , uniformly in @xmath22 results of this type have a long history . for @xmath58 and for the harmonic case with pinning of the type ( [ bump - pinning ] ) , the localization has been obtained in @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "what is the effect of the presence of the wall on the surface ?",
    "the crucial point is that the surface has local fluctuations , which push the interface away from the wall . on the other hand ,",

    "the energetically best way for the surface to leave some room for the local fluctuations is to move away from the wall in some global sense .",
    "this effect is called `` entropic repulsion '' and is well known in the physics literature .    the first mathematically rigorous treatment of entropic repulsion appeared in the paper by bricmont , frhlich and el mellouki @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",

    "let @xmath287 with probabilities @xmath288 and independently , @xmath289 one strategy of the path could be just to stay on the negative side all the time , i.e. @xmath290 for all @xmath291 this leads to a trivial lower bound of the free energy@xmath292 which is easily seen to exist , and is non - random:@xmath293   1_{\\left\\ {   \\phi_{i}<0,\\;\\forall i\\leq n\\right\\ } } \\right )   \\\\ & = \\exp\\left [   \\beta\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_{i}\\right ]   p\\left ( \\phi_{i}<0,\\;\\forall i\\leq n\\right )   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this we get@xmath294 it is quite plausible that localization dominates in the case where there is a strict inequality , and that delocalization holds if @xmath295      the phase separating function @xmath300 is certainly very much model dependent , but we expect that the tangent at @xmath19 is model independent , and would be the same for any random law of the @xmath267-sequence which has variance @xmath301 and a expectation @xmath302 , and has exponentially decaying tails , but this is not proved in @xcite . in physics literature , there are non - rigorous arguments claiming that the tangent is @xmath303 but we neither have been able to prove or disprove it , yet .",
    "we prove that the tangent at @xmath19 can be described in terms of a phase separation line for a continuous model , where the random walk is replaced by a brownian motion , and the random environment @xmath267 is replaced by ( biased ) white noise . in this case",
    ", the phase separation line is a straight line , and we prove that this line is the tangent at @xmath19 of our model . it should be remarked that the @xmath304 situation , can not be handled by simple perturbation techniques .",
    "a natural question is if in the localized region @xmath305 the path measure is really localized in the sense described in the paper of sinai .",
    "this is indeed the case and has been proved by biskup and den hollander @xcite .",
    "one might also wonder if in the localized region @xmath306 or at least in the interior of it , the path measure is really delocalized , which should mean , that it converges , after brownian rescaling , to the limit of a random walk conditioned to stay negative , which is the negative of the brownian meander .",
    "this seems to be a rather difficult question and has not been answered , yet .",
    "let @xmath307 where @xmath308 is periodic , i.e. such that there exists @xmath208 with @xmath309 for all @xmath310 and @xmath311 then there is a function @xmath312 such that ( [ copolymer_loc ] ) and ( [ copolymer_deloc ] ) hold . in this",
