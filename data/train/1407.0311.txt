    "much recent effort in graphene research has focused on attempts to introduce a bandgap into the otherwise semi - metallic electronic band structure of graphene .",
    "such a feature would allow the integration of graphene , with its many superlative physical , electronic , thermal and optical properties , into a wide range of device applications .",
    "@xcite in particular , the presence of a bandgap is a vital step in the development of a graphene transistor capable of competing with standard semiconductor - based devices .",
    "initial investigations into gapped graphene were primarily based around graphene nanoribbons , with the electron confinement induced by the presence of crystalline edges predicted to introduce a bandgap similar to that found in many carbon nanotubes.@xcite more recent efforts have turned towards graphene superlattices , where the imposition of a periodic perturbation of the graphene sheet is also predicted to open up a bandgap .",
    "the periodic perforation of a graphene sheet , to form a so - called graphene antidot lattice ( gal ) or nanomesh , is one such implementation of the latter technique . @xcite",
    "periodic gating@xcite and strain@xcite are other possible routes that have been suggested .",
    "theoretical studies of gal - based systems have suggested that the bandgap behaviour in many cases follows a simple scaling law relating the period of the perturbation and the antidot size.@xcite in other cases , more complex symmetry arguments involving the lattice geometry@xcite or the effect of edge states@xcite can be employed to predict the presence and magnitude of the bandgap .",
    "furthermore , it is predicted that only a small number of antidot rows are required to induce bulk - like transport gaps@xcite , suggesting the use of gals in finite barrier systems which do not suffer from the klein - tunnelling driven barrier leakage expected for gated systems.@xcite indeed , the potential barrier efficacy of gals suggests application in electron wave - guiding@xcite , in analogy with photonic crystals where antidot lattice geometries have also been considered.@xcite    however , many of these potential device applications are predicated on atomically precise graphene antidot structures , whereas experimental fabrication ( primarily involving block copolymer etching@xcite or electron beam lithography@xcite techniques ) will inevitably introduce a degree of imperfection and disorder into the system .",
    "it may however be possible to control the antidot edge geometries to some extent by heat treatment@xcite or selective etching@xcite .",
    "much like the properties of nanoribbons were found to be greatly affected by disorder,@xcite recent studies suggest that the electronic and optical properties of gals may also be strongly perturbed.@xcite we should therefore expect that the transport properties and device fidelity of the systems described above will depend on the degree of disorder present in the antidot lattice .    motivated by this concern we have simulated a wide range of finite gal devices , in both simple - barrier and waveguide geometries , with various disorder types and strengths .",
    "we find that the geometries predicted to give the largest bandgaps , namely those with a dense array of small holes , are particularly susceptible to the effects of disorder and that transport gaps are quickly quenched as leakage channels form at energies in the bandgap .",
    "geometric disorder , consisting of fluctuations in the positions and sizes of the antidots , is found to have a particularly dramatic effect .",
    "however , for larger antidots the signatures of such disorders are found to be strongly dependent on the edge geometry of the individual antidots .",
    "we observe different behaviour when the antidot edge atoms have armchair or zigzag configurations , or alternating sequences of both .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : section [ section_model ] introduces the geometry of the systems under consideration , the details of the electronic model and transport calculations and the types of disorder that will be applied .",
    "section [ sec_barrier_results ] examines in detail the transport properties of finite - length barrier geometry devices , starting with pristine systems ( [ subs_sec_clean ] ) .",
    "small antidot systems with edge roughness ( [ subsec_edge_roughness ] ) and geometric disorders ( [ subsec_geo_dis ] ) are presented , before we consider larger antidot systems and edge geometry effects with and without the presence of disorder ( [ subsec_edge_effects ] ) .",
    "section [ sec_wg ] considers devices with waveguide geometries and with the various types of antidots and disorders discussed previously for barrier devices .",
    "finally , section [ sec_conclude ] summarizes and discusses the implications of our results in the context of device optimization and recent experimental progress .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it is worth comparing the antidot geometry and disorder levels considered in this work to those reported by experiment .",
    "lattices of circular antidots with feature sizes on the order of @xmath0 have been reported and the level of geometric disorder in these cases is given by the standard deviation ( @xmath1 ) in the distribution of neck widths between neighbouring antidots@xcite .",
    "this quantity is easily extracted from the geometries generated in this work , and we can associate each @xmath1 with a particular strength of position ( @xmath2 ) or radial ( @xmath3 ) disorder applied either individually or in combination .",
    "table [ table_experiment ] shows the approximate antidot geometry parameters and disorder strengths corresponding to the experimental data in references [ ] and [ ] .",
    "we note that systems tabulated here are generally much larger than those simulated in this work and have greater levels of disorder",
    ". however , set d has feature sizes only three times larger than the @xmath4 antidots examined in section [ subsec_edge_effects ] .",
    "the relative level of disorder in this system is also similar to that studied in this work , so that our large antidot system results should hold for experimentally realisable structures .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is some experimental evidence of transport gaps in gal systems@xcite .",
    "the systems investigated in these works are composed of antidot lattices which , in comparison to the systems studied here , are strongly disordered .",
    "the effective bandgap in these systems is generally extracted from the temperature dependence of the conductance .",
    "it should be noted that it is difficult to differentiate transport gaps emerging from periodicity - induced confinement , or from purely disorder - induced localisation effects .",
    "highly disordered antidot lattices essentially consist of a random network of disordered nanoribbons , and these have been shown to be particularly susceptible individually to disorder - induced transport gaps@xcite .",
    "the bandgap sizes extracted from these experiments also fit reasonably well with nanoribbon bandgap scaling laws .",
    "furthermore , we note that only triangular lattices aligned correctly with the underlying graphene lattice are predicted to induce a bandgap for all lattice spacings",
    ". other lattice geometries may be metallic or semiconducting depending on the lattice spacing , and antidots with zigzag edges follow different bandgap scaling laws .",
    "the experimental results were based on square@xcite and triangular@xcite lattices , but in the latter case it is unclear how the antidot lattice aligns with the underlying graphene lattice .",
    "thus it is not even clear whether the associated pristine lattices necessarily would produce a bandgap , and it is thus very difficult to conclude that the experimental bandgaps reported to date are due to the periodic modulation of graphene outlined in ref . .",
    "even in atomically precise gal systems , long - range potential disorder arising from , for example , substrate impurities may play an important role in determining transport properties .",
    "studies of such disorder in graphene nanoribbons@xcite and quantum dots@xcite have shown that the strength of intervalley scattering depends strongly on the edge geometries and underlying symmetry classes of these structures .",
    "we expect similar effects to arise in antidot systems , and that the magnetoconductance and universal conductance fluctuations will display a strong dependence on the antidot size , shape and edge geometry .",
    "this work has demonstrated that the electronic structure features predicted for periodically modulated graphene systems can be extremely sensitive to atomic scale imperfections and defects .",
    "furthermore , we have outlined a strategy to optimise the performance of antidot based barrier devices based on these features .",
    "however , there are other features of nanostructured systems whose interplay with disorder may prove very interesting .",
    "the magnetic properties of zigzag - edged antidots have been investigated for the pristine case@xcite , but the effect of randomised edge lengths may introduce new features by breaking the equivalency of neighbouring edges and thus the overall spin degeneracy of hexagonal antidot systems .",
    "the effect of chemical functionalisation@xcite on graphene antidot lattices is also of keen interest , particularly in the light of recent results suggesting that the conductance variation of highly disordered perforated graphene sheets allows for gas sensing at extremely low concentrations@xcite .",
    "future investigation of nanostructured graphene along these lines is bound to yield many intriguing results and extend the applicability of graphene - based materials .",
