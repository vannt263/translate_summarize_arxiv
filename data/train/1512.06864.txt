    "<S> bosonic symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) states are gapped disordered phases of matter possessing symmetry - preserving boundary excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that , at long wavelengths , the universal properties of an spt system are captured by an effective non - linear sigma model field theory in the presence of a quantized topological @xmath0-term . by studying lattice models of bosonic spt states , we are able to identify , in their euclidean path integral formulation , ( discrete ) berry phases that hold relevant physical information on the nature of the spt ground states . these discrete berry phases are given intuitive physical interpretation in terms of instanton effects that capture the presence of a @xmath0-term on the microscopic scale . </S>"
