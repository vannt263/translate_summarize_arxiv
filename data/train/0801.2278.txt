    "in addition , a number of regular type iin sne have developed at some stages clear evidence of narrow ( from a few @xmath2100 km s@xmath0 to @xmath12000 km s@xmath0 ) he i lines although , contrary to sne ibn , they are always less prominent than h@xmath3 .",

    "the narrow lines ( both of h and he i ) are thought to originate in a slowly - moving circumstellar medium ( csm ) which is photoionized either by early uv flux or interaction with the sn ejecta .",

    "this comparison highlights a rough similarity between the spectra of sn  2005la ( especially at 20 - 21@xmath8 after the discovery ) and that of sn  2006jc .",
    "however , h@xmath3 is prominent in sn  2005la ( although much weaker than in sn 1995 g ) .",
    "its h@xmath3 is comparable with the most prominent he i lines ( i.e. @xmath95876 and @xmath97065 ) at early epochs and is stronger than the he i lines only in the last spectrum . fig .",

    "the relative strengths of the h and he i lines may change as a result of abundance and , possibly , ionization effects .",
    "the latter is mostly expected in objects whose ejecta are interacting with a csm .    unlike sn 2005la , the spectrum of sn  2006jc shows a very weak ( practically invisible ) h@xmath3 during the first 3 months @xcite .",
    "this line becomes more prominent only at very late epochs @xcite .",
    "instead , in type iin sne , a narrow ( typically with v@xmath11 1000 km s@xmath0 ) h@xmath3 dominates in strength at any phase over the he i lines .    in tab .",
    "[ tab4 ] we report the velocities of sn  2005la as derived from measuring the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a number of lines ( h and he i ) .",
    "while the he i lines show a clear p - cygni profile , this is not obvious for the h lines .",
    "the velocities derived from the position of the p - cygni minima of the he i lines are quite consistent ( @xmath1 2000 - 2200 km s@xmath0 , see also tab .",
    "[ tab4 ] ) with the fwhm velocities ( v@xmath12 ) of the same lines .",
    "we find that in the 7th december spectrum the v@xmath12 derived for the h lines is about 1500 km s@xmath0 , while it is slightly higher for the he i lines ( v@xmath12 @xmath13 2150 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "these lines are probably produced in an unshocked csm surrounding the sn .",
    "once the sn ejecta reach the csm , this material is expected to accelerate .",
    "a bump near 7800  is tentatively identified as a proper sn ejecta feature , probably o i @xmath97774 .",
    "the low s / n does not allow us to properly measure the velocity of this feature , but ( despite the uncertainty ) it is significantly higher ( v@xmath12 = 4900@xmath51200 ) than the other lines identified in the december 7th spectrum .",
    "this velocity can be considered as representative for the ejecta velocity .",
    ", width=325 ]    the two subsequent spectra ( december 10 and 11 ) show that the line velocities are increasing ( v@xmath12 @xmath13 1900 km s@xmath0 for the h lines ; v@xmath12 @xmath13 3150 km s@xmath0 for the he lines ) , indicating an evident acceleration of the he- and , more marginally , of the h - rich cs region . in the last spectrum of sn  2005la , obtained about two weeks later , all lines are in pure emission ( see fig . [ fig3b ] ) , as expected when driven by the high - energy radiation resulting from the interaction of the ejecta with the dense csm close to the sn . moreover , the velocity of both the h and he i lines is much higher , being v@xmath12 @xmath13 4200 km s@xmath0 , which is close to that estimated for the o i @xmath97774 line .",
    "no extended wings are observed for the emission features , as one would expect if the line broadening was a result of scattering of photons of the narrow lines by the thermal electrons of the circumstellar gas ( as was observed in sn 1998s , * ? ? ?",
    "it is remarkable that the absorption features in the region between 4600 and 5200  ( possibly due to fe ii lines and detected with comparable widths also in sne ib / c ) , the overall blue colour and the drop of the flux beyond 5400 , seem to be common characteristics of most interacting core - collapse sne ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "sn  2005la shows clear evidence of the presence of csm produced by the precursor star before the sn explosion .",
    "the sn spectra indicate that this material is rich in both h and he .",
    "however there are some spectroscopic indications that the inner csm is more he - rich , while h is more abundant in more external regions of the csm . from the available data ,",
    "it is very difficult to understand if this material was produced through a dense , continuum wind or via major outburst episodes similar to those observed in a number of lbvs ( or , alternatively , in luminous outbursts of wr stars analogous to the transient ugc 4904-v1 which preceded by two years",
    "the explosion of sn  2006jc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    up to now",
    ", it was commonly accepted that core - collapse explosions occur substantially ( @xmath1 a few times 10@xmath14 years ) after the last major mass - loss episode",
    ". however , the precedent of sn  2006jc should give impulse to the efforts of finding evidence for similar luminous outbursts occurring only a few years before the explosion of interacting core - collapse sne .",
    "unfortunately , the host galaxy of sn  2005la was not frequently monitored in the past , and very few images are currently available in public archives .",
    "we analysed b and sloan r band images of kug 1249 + 278 ( with exposure times of 3@xmath2300s and 600s , respectively ) obtained on 2002 march 10th with the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope in la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the data have been downloaded from the ing archive .",
    "another set of images were obtained making use of the smoka science archive .",
    "the host of sn  2005la was observed at the 1.05-m schmidt telescope of the kiso observatory ( university of tokyo , japan ) on 2003 march 11th ( 4@xmath2300s and 3@xmath2300s in the v and r bands , respectively ) .",
    "finally , the texas sn search has intensively ( almost daily ) monitored the region of kug 1249 + 278 ( from november 20 , 2004 to july 7 , 2005 ) , but no evidence of pre - sn outbursts was found ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is not really unexpected since the deepest magnitude limits registered for the rotse - iiib telescopes are near magnitude 20 . with the assumptions on the distance and extinction discussed in sect .",
    "[ general ] , only outbursts more luminous than m@xmath15 @xmath1 -14.5 would be detected , which is an absolute magnitude very close to the brightest eruptions reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and only @xmath12.7 magnitudes fainter than the peak magnitude registered for sn  2005la .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the pre - explosion images do not provide any useful information on the mass loss processes that occurred in the last years of life of the progenitor of sn  2005la .",
    ", width=326 ]",
    "the spectroscopic properties of sn  2005la , especially the peculiar intensity ratio between h@xmath3 and the most prominent he i lines ( @xmath95876 and @xmath97065 ) suggest that this object could be classified as lying somewhere between the classical type iin sne @xcite and the type ibn events @xcite . however , the rapidly evolving light curve of sn  2005la , and the very fast decline of the optical luminosity ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) is more typical for the family of sn  2006jc .",
    "there now appears to be strong observational evidence that normal type ii - p sne have red supergiant progenitors which have fairly moderate initial masses @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are no discoveries of any red supergiants with masses definitely more than 20m@xmath16 .",
    "the case of the blue supergiant exploding as sn 1987a is still not well understood from the stellar evolutionary point of view , but binarity is the most likely explanation @xcite . hence one might conjecture that higher mass stars explode as some other type of event .    there is a reasonable probability that wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars of type wn and wc / o are the direct progenitors of at least some sne  ib and ic .",
    "recent modelling of the light curves of type ic sne have yielded ejecta masses ( c and o dominated ) that have some overlap with the core masses of wc stars determined from luminosity measurements and stellar evolutionary models . for example , ejecta masses of 2.5 - 5m@xmath16 for sn 2002ap @xcite and 3.5 - 8m@xmath16 for sn 2004aw @xcite were determined , while suggest masses of 7 - 19m@xmath16 for wc stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the galaxy .",
    "while these mass ranges just about overlap , the fact that the explosion of sn 2002ap was asymmetric and lack of a large sample of sn ib / c ejecta or progenitor mass estimates still leaves open the question of the origins of these events .",
    "there is also mounting evidence that type ib / c sne are associated with environments which show stronger h@xmath3 emission and have higher surface brightness than do the environments of type ii - p sne .",
    "this would suggest the progenitors are more likely from higher mass stars , and hence above 15 - 20m@xmath16 .",
    "although rather unexpectedly the spatial type ib sn distribution of @xcite resembles the type ii sn distribution .",
    "there is one possible detection of a type iin sn progenitor , that of sn 2005gl @xcite , although the object is exceptionally bright for a single star and it remains uncertain if it is actually one of the most luminous stars that can exist , a very high - mass lbv or if it is actually an unresolved stellar cluster .    in the case of the type iin sn 2005gl ,",
    "the ejecta started to interact early with the material likely lost through major eruptions a short time before the explosion of the star . from this point of view",
    ", there is a remarkable analogy with the sequence of events that led to sn 2006jc in ugc 4904 , as a luminous pre - sn outburst followed two years later by the real sn explosion @xcite .",
    "in such a case , if the precursor of sn 2006jc was a single massive star , it was responsible for the outburst observed on october 2004 @xcite , in which a significant amount of material was likely expelled .",
    "sn 2006jc was monitored in detail for several months after october 2006 , and the spectra showed relatively narrow he i emission lines , indicating that the sn ejecta were interacting with a slower moving he - rich csm . as a consequence ,",
    "the 2004 luminous outburst was probably produced by a wr star transiting between the wn and wc / o phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps _ all _ precursor stars of the interacting type ibn sne are rare objects @xcite which lie in the region between more typical wn and wc / o stars ( which should produce sne ib and sne ic , respectively ) .",
    "one might draw a parallel between this argument and that used to relate the lbv progenitors of sne iin to the rsg / bsg progenitors of non - interacting sne ii .    in this context ,",
    "sn  2005la is unique , because it shares properties with both sne iin and sne ibn .",
    "hence we suggest that sn  2005la might have been produced by the explosion of a star which was transiting from the lbv to the wr ( wn - type ) phase . from the analysis of the sn properties , the young wn precursor of sn  2005la should have suffered a major mass loss episode ( or possibly several episodes ) a few years before the sn explosion .",
    "one would expect that during these episodes a significant amount of he - rich material ( with residual h ) was lost .",
    "the detection of outbursts similar to that seen for sn 2006jc and other similar sne would be an exciting discovery as it would hint that the instability may be directly related to the imminent core - collapse .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of the available pre - sn archive images for sn 2005la ( see sect . [ outburst ] ) does not provide any direct confirmation for this scenario although , of course , it does not exclude it .",
    "wide field transient searches which sample low - mass and hence low metallicity galaxies are the obvious way forward to discover more of these peculiar and interesting sne .",
    "for example the blank - field strategy of the texas supernova search has discovered a large number of peculiar sne ( e.g. the weird sn  2005ap , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the future pan - starrs project @xcite will have the capability of increasing these discoveries further and more extensive monitoring of the events will help to shed light on the post - main - sequence evolution of the most massive stars .",

    "<S> we present photometric and spectroscopic data of the peculiar sn  2005la , an object which shows an optical light curve with some luminosity fluctuations and spectra with comparably strong narrow hydrogen and helium lines , probably of circumstellar nature . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing full - width - half - maximum velocity of these lines is indicative of an acceleration of the circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> sn  2005la exhibits hybrid properties , sharing some similarities with both type iin supernovae and 2006jc - like ( type ibn ) events . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the progenitor of sn  2005la was a very young wolf - rayet ( wn - type ) star which experimented mass ejection episodes shortly before core collapse .    </S>",
