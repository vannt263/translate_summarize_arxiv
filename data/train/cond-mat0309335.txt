    "a metal - insulator transition is one of the most important topics in solid - state physics @xcite . in case of a conventional semiconductor , donors ( acceptors ) supply electrons ( holes ) in a band insulator .",
    "a metal - insulator transition takes place at a critical carrier density , where the average carrier - carrier distance is comparable with the effective bohr radius of the doped impurity atom .",
    "the critical carrier density has been quantitatively discussed for various semiconductors @xcite .",
    "metal - insulator transitions in strongly correlated systems are completely different from that in a band insulator @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable example is that in high - temperature superconductors , where the metallic state is accompanied by high temperature superconductivity .",
    "as the second example , the colossal magnetoresistive manganites exhibit a peculiar transition where the metallic state is stabilized by ferromagnetism . actually , there are many types of insulating state ( mott insulator , charge ordering , and stripes ) for strongly correlated systems , and accordingly there are so many ways how these insulating states collapse upon doping , pressure , temperature , and external field .",
    "since transition - metal oxides are often insulating due to the strong correlation , they can be a good playground for studies of metal - insulator transitions . in this sense",
    ", we have paid special attention to capd@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 shows the crystal structure of capd@xmath2o@xmath3 known as a napt@xmath2o@xmath3-type structure .",
    "the divalent pd@xmath4 of ( 4@xmath5)@xmath6 is surrounded with four o@xmath7 anions , and the pdo@xmath3 clusters stack one another to form a column . because of the cubic symmetry , the pdo@xmath3 column runs along the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 directions to make a thee - dimensional network .",
    ", width=226 ]    the first interesting point is that capd@xmath2o@xmath3 shows a metal - insulator transition by substitution of na for ca , as was found by itoh et al @xcite .",
    "secondly , the ground state of capd@xmath2o@xmath3 might be exotic .",
    "hase and nishihra @xcite claimed that capd@xmath2o@xmath3 was a possible candidate for an excitonic insulator , in which electrons and holes bounded as excitons exhibit a bose - einstein condensation at low temperatures .",
    "thirdly , a pd ion is more stable as pd@xmath4 and pd@xmath11 than pd@xmath12 .",
    "such a kind of ion is called `` valence skipper '' .",
    "thus the doped holes are most likely to exist as pd@xmath11 , where two holes are on the same pd site .",
    "varma @xcite predicted that doped carriers in the valence skipper form on - site pairs to exhibit a possible high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "in this paper we report on measurement and analysis of the transport properties of li doped capd@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we have found that capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is essentially a degenerate semiconductor of low carrier concentration ( 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) . with increasing li content , the resistivity , the seebeck coefficient , and the hall coefficient systematically change , from which the carrier concentration and the effective mass are reasonably evaluated .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath8=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 and 0.6 ) were prepared by a solid - state reaction aided with nacl addition .",
    "stoichiometric amount of pdo , caco@xmath2 , and lico@xmath2 of 99.9% purity were thoroughly mixed .",
    "nacl was then added with the mixture in a mass ratio of 2:1 , thoroughly mixed again , and fired at 1073 k for 24 h in air .",
    "the product was finely ground , and nacl was rinsed out in hot distilled water .",
    "the dried powder was then pressed into pellets , and was sintered in air at 1223 k for 48 h for @xmath8=0 , and at 1103 k for 12 h for @xmath15 .",
    "we think that nacl acts as a kind of flux . at an early stage of this study ,",
    "20% of metal pd appeared as an impurity phase in the powder sintered above 1173 k without nacl , suggesting that the sintering temperature was too high to keep pd oxidized .",
    "we then decreased the sintering temperature , but found that the prepared samples were loosely sintered , too fragile to handle .",
    "added nacl was effective to decrease the sintering temperature without reducing pdo .",
    "( a ) @xmath16 , and ( b ) @xmath17 , width=264 ]    the samples were characterized through the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) with fe k@xmath18 as an x - ray source in a @xmath19 scan mode .",
    "the resistivity was measured by a four - terminal method from 4.2 to 300 k in a liquid he cryostat , and from 300 to 700 k in a cylinder furnace in air .",
    "the seebeck coefficient was measured using a steady - state technique with a typical temperature gradient of 1.0 k / cm from 4.2 to 300 k in a liquid he cryostat , and from 300 to 500 k in a cylinder furnace in air .",
    "the seebeck coefficient of the voltage leads was carefully subtracted .",
    "the hall coefficient was measured in a closed refrigerator from 10 to 150 k. a cernox resistive thermometer was placed at 45 cm above the magnet core , which successfully suppressed the magnetoresistance of the thermometer to keep the accuracy of the measured temperature within 0.01% at 7 t. an ac - bridge nano - ohmmeter was used to measure the resistivity by sweeping magnetic field from -7 to 7 t in 20 minutes at constant temperatures .",
    "an unwanted signal occurring from a misalignment of the voltage pads was carefully removed by subtracting negative - field data from positive - field data .",
    "the hall voltage was linear in magnetic field , and the hall coefficient was determined by the data at @xmath207 t.",
    "figure 2 shows typical xrd patterns of the prepared samples . for @xmath16 ,",
    "all the reflection peaks are indexed as a napt@xmath2o@xmath3-type structure with an a - axis length @xmath21 of 5.74 @xcite . as is shown in the inset , @xmath21 decreases systematically with @xmath8 , which clearly indicates that li@xmath22 ( 0.76 ) and ca@xmath4 ( 1.00 ) make a solid solution . for @xmath17 , however , a tiny ( 5% ) trace of reduced pd is observed near @xmath2351 deg .",
    "the amount of the reduced pd gradually increases with @xmath8 for @xmath24 , and exceeds 10% for @xmath25 .",
    "li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 , width=245 ]    figure 3(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity ( @xmath26 ) of the prepared samples .",
    "the resistivity changes systematically with @xmath8 , whose magnitude at 4.2 k decreases by four orders of magnitude from @xmath16 to 0.6 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the substituted li supplies carriers into the sample . towards 0 k , @xmath26 for @xmath16",
    "divergingly increases while @xmath26 for @xmath27 remains a finite value .",
    "this means the metal - insulator transition takes place between @xmath16 and 0.1 .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath28 ) of the prepared samples .",
    "all the seebeck coefficients are positive , indicating that the majority carrier is a hole in this system .",
    "@xmath28 for @xmath16 is roughly proportional to temperature below 100 k , which is a hallmark of a conventional metal . in the sense",
    "that a finite carrier concentration remains as @xmath29 0 , capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is essentially a metal . considering the large thermopower",
    ", it would be more appropreate to regard capd@xmath2o@xmath3 as a degenerate semiconductor rather than a metal .",
    "with increasing @xmath8 , @xmath28 systematically decreases , which indicates that the substituted li supplies holes to ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the doped samples also show a similar @xmath30-linear seebeck coefficient at low temperatures to the @xmath16 sample . at high temperatures for smaller @xmath8",
    ", the seebeck coefficient takes a maximum and decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this means that the minority carriers ( electrons in this case ) are thermally excited , and also means that the band gap of capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is smaller than hundreds of k.    figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ( @xmath31 ) of the prepared samples . as is similar to the seebeck coefficient , the sign of the hall coefficient is positive for all the samples , indicating the majority carriers are holes .",
    "the magnitude systematically decreases with increasing @xmath8 , and @xmath31 s for @xmath27 and 0.2 are essentially independent of temperature .",
    "these results are what is expected in a conventional metal , magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration .",
    "li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 , width=226 ]    we should note that @xmath31 for @xmath16 saturates as @xmath32 .",
    "this clearly indicates that capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is essentially a degenerate semiconductor with a low carrier concentration of 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , which is consistent with the @xmath30-linear @xmath28 .",
    "contrary to the theoretical prediction by hase and nishihara @xcite , capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is unlikely to be an excitonic insulator having the charge gap of the order of an exciton binding energy at low temperatures .",
    "thus we conclude that the nonmetallic @xmath26 for @xmath16 is due to localization effects .",
    "@xmath31 for @xmath16 exhibits remarkable temperature dependence , which implies the existence of the additional carriers activated thermally .",
    "this further suggests that the activation energy is smaller than a few tens of k , because @xmath31 is clearly dependent on temperature down to 10 k. the small activation energy can also explain the 170-k peak in @xmath28 for @xmath16 , where the thermally activated electrons dominates at high temperatures .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath31 and @xmath28 show different temperature dependences .",
    "according to a two - band model consisting of electrons and holes , @xmath31 and @xmath28 are averaged with different weights of electron ( @xmath33 ) and hole ( @xmath34 ) conductivities .",
    "a more quantitive analysis would be difficult , unless @xmath33 and @xmath34 were experimentally determined .",
    "a possible candidate for the small activation energy is the band gap of capd@xmath2o@xmath3 . according to the intuitive explanation by doublet et al .",
    "@xcite , the valence band of capd@xmath2o@xmath3 consists of pd 4@xmath35 , while the conduction band consists of pd 4@xmath36 hybridized strongly with o 2@xmath37 . owing to the large dispersion of the pd 4@xmath35 band ,",
    "the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands is expected to be small .",
    "in fact , the band calculation @xcite showed that capd@xmath2o@xmath3 was a semi - metal with zero band - gap .",
    "now we will make a quantitative discussion on the metal - insulator transition in capd@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "as already mentioned , li substitution supplies holes in capd@xmath2o@xmath3 , and the doped holes seem `` normal '' , in the sense that they give the @xmath30-linear seebeck coefficients and the @xmath30-independent hall coefficients at low temperature .",
    "thus we employ the simplest formula of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the hole concentration .",
    "then @xmath31 s for @xmath27 ( 7.7@xmath4010@xmath41 @xmath42/c ) and @xmath43 ( 3.7@xmath4010@xmath41 @xmath42/c ) correspond to 0.08 and 0.16 holes per unit formula , respectively . in spite of the rough estimation ,",
    "the hole concentration obtained from @xmath31 is in good agreement with @xmath8 , and we can roughly assume that the li content @xmath8 supplies @xmath8 holes per li cation .        in the lowest order approximation ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient of a conventional metal is expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fermi energy .",
    "then @xmath45 can be experimentally determined from the @xmath30-linear part of the seebeck coefficient as @xmath46 [ ev ] . figure 5(a ) shows @xmath47 for the prepared samples .",
    "all the data are roughly independent of temperature at 80 k , from which we evaluate @xmath45 for each sample .",
    "we think that @xmath48 at low temperatures is less reliable , owing to the small magnitude of @xmath28 and low sensitivity of the copper - constantan thermocouple below 10 k.    figure 5(b ) shows the evaluated @xmath45 plotted as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "we further assume a nearly free hole with an effective mass of @xmath49 , the fermi energy is written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bare mass of an electron ( note that a unit cell includes two unit formulae ) .",
    "the dotted and solid curves show the calculated @xmath45 with @xmath524 and 6 , respectively , between which the evaluated @xmath45 lies .",
    "this means that the effective mass of ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 is nearly independent of @xmath8 , and is moderately ( 4 - 6 times ) enhanced from the bare mass , possibly owing to the 4d nature .",
    "finally we will make brief comments on remaining issues .",
    "( i ) ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 is a possible candidate for a p - type thermoelectric oxide @xcite .",
    "a thermoelectric material is a material that converts heat into electric power , and electric power into heat , through the thermoelectric phenomena in solids .",
    "the thermoelectric power factor @xmath53 is 1.6 @xmath54w / cm k@xmath55 for @xmath56 at 300 k , which is comparable to the value for the polycrystalline naco@xmath57o@xmath3 known as a promising candidate for a thermoelectric oxide @xcite .",
    "( ii ) at present , we have no direct evidence that the doped holes form on - site pairs like pd@xmath11 .",
    "the charge transport observed in the present paper is quantitatively explained in terms of nearly free holes with the enhanced mass . in other words ,",
    "this system is highly robust against charge disproportionaltion and/or charge density wave .",
    "the orthogonally entangled pdo@xmath3 columns may play an important role , as was suggested by doublet et al.@xcite another reason would be that the carrier concentration was too low to observe the `` valence skipper '' effects . in the case of bi oxides ,",
    "the valence skipper effects are most remarkable in babio@xmath2 , where the charge ordered state of bi@xmath12 and bi@xmath58 are stabilized . with doping , the bi@xmath12-bi@xmath58 state collapses and the band picture gradually recovers . in the present study ,",
    "the pd@xmath11 content is less than 10 % , and this corresponds to bapb@xmath0bi@xmath59o@xmath2 ( @xmath60 ) which can be explained by the band picture @xcite .",
    "thus it would be more tempting to synthesize a pd oxide consisting of ( formally ) pd@xmath12 to search for the valence skipper effects .",
    "( iii ) the small band gap implies that electrons can be doped in the conduction band .",
    "preliminarily we succeeded in electron doping by substitution of a trivalent ion ( la@xmath12 , y@xmath12 , and bi@xmath12 ) for ca@xmath4 .",
    "( iv ) the present results are quite different from @xmath26 and @xmath28 for ca@xmath0na@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 by itoh et al.@xcite we prepared na substituted samples , but found that @xmath26 and @xmath28 were essentially the same as those for ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we employed `` nacl flux '' technique to suppress reduction of pdo , but itoh et al .",
    "used conventional solid state reaction .",
    "thus the different preparation method might give different samples .",
    "the resistivity , the seebeck coefficient , and the hall coefficient for ca@xmath0li@xmath1pd@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath8=0 - 0.6 ) have been measured and analyzed . since the parent material capd@xmath2o@xmath3 is a degenerate semiconductor with a finite carrier concentration of 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , it is unlikely to be an excitonic insulator as suggested by hase and nishihara @xcite .",
    "the metal - insulator transition in this system is thus basically driven by localization effects .",
    "the carrier concentration dependence of the hall and seebeck coefficients is consistently explained in terms of a simple one - band picture , where a hole with a moderately enhanced mass ( @xmath614 - 6 ) is itinerant three - dimensionally ."
