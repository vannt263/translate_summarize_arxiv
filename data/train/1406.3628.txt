    "there has been much interest over the last decade in the possibility that fundamental dimensionless constants may evolve or in some way be a product of the history of the region in which they lie @xcite . in the case of the fine - structure constant , @xmath0 ,",
    "one group has claimed to see such time variation @xcite and spatial variation @xcite using the `` many multiplet '' ( mm ) method of analyzing quasar absorption line spectra , which they pioneered @xcite .",
    "however , this positive result is limited to one group and more stringent null results , using the same methodology , have been reported @xcite .",

    "these results provide an alternative source of evidence for a non - varying @xmath0 that has different systematic effects to the mm method , though the interpretation depends on assuming a low value for the change in @xmath11 for which there is direct evidence at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a summary of results at higher redshift ) .",
    "the discrepancy in published results could be reconciled if systematic effects dominate the measurements , leading to underestimates of the errors . in the present paper",
    "we consider both systematic uncertainties in spectrograph wavelength calibration and also velocity offsets introduced by complex velocity structure in even apparently simple and weak narrow lines and analyze their effect on claimed variations in @xmath0 .",
    "the current observational situation regarding variation in @xmath0is far from clear . terrestrial laboratory and geophysical measurements show no sign of any time variation on both long and short time scales .",
    "laboratory measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the stability of atomic clocks are consistent with no instantaneous time variation at the present time , while analysis of the oklo natural fission reactor places a limit of @xmath13 over a time span of 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "astronomical measurements , on the other hand , have so far given both null results and also the first reported detections of variation .",
    "a number of groups have looked for variation in @xmath0  over cosmic time in quasar absorption lines at high redshift using various methodologies .",
    "all such measurements based on comparing the relative wavelength separation of the two members of an alkaline doublet observed at high redshift in a quasar absorption system @xcite are consistent with no evolution @xcite .",
    "it was only with the advent of the more sensitive mm method @xcite that a significant change at the level of @xmath14  was claimed over the redshift range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the enormous advantage of the mm method is its sensitivity : it is sensitive to @xmath16  at a level of about @xmath17 in an individual quasar absorption line system , making it about an order of magnitude better than the alkaline doublet method . on the other hand ,",
    "this sensitivity is bought at the price of much greater required control of systematic effects , among the most important of which are the accuracy of the wavelength calibrations in the echelle spectrographs being used for the measurements , and the assumptions of uniform velocity structure in the various ion species being compared and uniform spatial abundance patterns @xcite .",
    "the wavelength calibration is particularly critical since , in contrast to the alkaline doublet method , the lines being compared in the mm method can have wide wavelength separations .",
    "while these systematic effects have been extensively investigated and modeled @xcite , it is still likely that they do in fact dominate the measurement error and are responsible for the discrepancies in published results .",
    "a suitable choice of ionic species can minimize or exclude some of the potential systematic errors associated with the mm method .",
    "in particular , concerns about systematics in the wavelength calibration can be reduced by using lines of singly ionised cr and zn to measure individual offsets since these lines are neighboring and interspersed with one another ( figure  [ fig : lines ] ) . since the effect of a change in @xmath0 is large and in the opposite sense for the two species @xcite",
    ", these two ions also provide an optimally sensitive measurement . for",
    "the neighboring @xmath18and the @xmath18  lines , a change of @xmath19 produces a relative offset of @xmath20  @xcite",
    ". this is large enough that with a simple sharp absorption line we can hope to measure the offset directly .",
    "a crucially important estimate of the magnitude of systematic errors in the mm method comes from having the required sensitivity and spectral resolution to fully analyze a _",
    "single _ system at one redshift and map the velocity shifts from ion to ion @xcite .",
    "this is what we do here for two such systems , at @xmath21 in the quasar hs1946 + 7658 and at @xmath7   in the quasar he1104@xmath221805a .",
    "however , suitable cr and zn systems are rare and most of the mm measurements have been made using and lines , which have two disadvantages .",
    "first , the offset between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the @xmath25 doublet is smaller ( @xmath26 for @xmath19 ) than for the cr and zn lines ; and second , these systems have a much wider wavelength separation .",
    "we shall show here that it is extremely hard using the hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope to obtain the necessary wavelength accuracy for this type of measurement .",
    "the full spectrum covers the wavelength range from 4000 to @xmath27 with a resolution of 72,000 measured from the sky lines .",
    "the wavelength was calibrated with a 4th - order polynomial fit to a thar calibration lamp taken before and after the exposure and absolutely calibrated using night sky lines in the spectrum as discussed in the text .",

    "for the present study we chose three quasars from our existing data base of high resolution quasar spectra @xcite which appeared optimal for measuring the fine structure variation .",
    "these are he1104 - 1805a ( @xmath28 ) , hs1700 + 6416 ( @xmath29 ) , and hs1946 + 7658 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these three quasars are very bright , allowing us to obtain high signal - to - noise observations even at very high spectral resolution ( @xmath1 ) and their spectra all contain narrow , strong ( but not saturated ) lines with corresponding strong . in addition he1104 - 1805a and hs1946 + 7658",
    "contain damped lyman @xmath0  ( dla ) absorbers with simple sharp and unsaturated metal lines that are ideal for measuring the fine structure variation with multiple lines and , in particular , znii and crii .",
    "he1104 - 1805 is a gravitationally lensed system with multiple images @xcite , of which the brightest ( image `` a '' ) is extremely luminous .",
    "the @xmath7  dla absorber has intermediate strength and lines in its spectrum ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; figure  [ fig : lines ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the dominant feature in the weaker singly - ionized absorption lines of the @xmath7 system is extremely sharp ( @xmath33 ) and was only marginally resolved in our earlier moderately high resolution ( @xmath34 ) observations .",
    "these earlier observations already suggested there was a velocity offset between the and lines in this system .",
    "hs1946 + 7658 also has an isolated narrow system corresponding to the dla absorber at @xmath6 which is seen in the , and lines , though this system is weaker than that in he1104 - 1805a and some useful lines lie in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the upgrade of the ccds in hires spectrograph on the keck  i 10 m telescope in 2004 provided finer pixel sampling and allowed the instrument to achieve proper sampling of the high spectral resolution that could be obtained with narrow slits .",
    "we therefore began an intensive observing program on these three quasars using a slit width of @xmath35 , corresponding to a spectral resolution of @xmath1 , in which we paid careful attention to the wavelength calibration .",
    "the seeing was generally larger than the slit width so the slit illumination should be uniform .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in  [ secwave ] .",

    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration is a crucial constraint in achieving the sensitivity necessary to measure evolution in the fundamental constants , particularly if widely separated lines such as and are being used , and requires the adoption of very careful observing techniques and attention to systematics .",
    "this has previously been discussed for the hires spectrograph by @xcite , who used iodine cell exposures to evaluate the systematics of thar lamp calibration techniques , and @xcite , who presented a calibration procedure for the vlt / uves spectrograph that removes systematics previously noted in the pipeline procedure by @xcite . to obtain the wavelength calibration , we made thar lamp exposures before and after each object exposure , and also took a number of exposures each night of white dwarf standards with the iodine cell in place . since griest et al .",
    "have made a thorough study of the iodine cell calibration , we will not discuss this issue any further here but concentrate on how well the calibration can be made using only thar lines .",
    "it should be noted that many of the archival observations used in previous analyses of the variation in the fine - structure constant did not aim for precision calibration .",
    "the present discussion relates to observations specifically designed to obtain the most accurate calibrations possible with the thar lamp .",
    "we first discuss the drift in wavelength calibration exhibited by the before and after thar lamp spectra , and then analyze the accuracy of the best possible thar calibrations using night sky lines that are present in the object spectra , and also using the multiple measurements of the various lines furnished by the independent observations , and comparing the velocities of doublets seen in the spectra .",

    "[ fig : drift_orders ] , width=480 ]              a preliminary wavelength calibration was made using the thar calibration lamp exposures made before and after each quasar exposure ( i.e. with a typical 80 minute separation ) . in each order we fitted gaussians to between 15 and 20 lines uniformly covering the wavelength range .",
    "we then used a fourth - order polynomial to obtain the wavelength fit .",
    "the typical dispersion in the thar lines relative to the wavelength solution is 0.0016 .    in order to measure the drift in the calibration we measured the shifts in individual thar lines between the before and after calibrations .",
    "examples of these measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : drift ] .",
    "the most pronounced effect is an overall wavelength offset , up to 0.025  at 6000  over an 80-minute observing period in an extreme case though the more typical value is @xmath42 . in figure",
    "[ fig : drift ] we show that the effect is smoothly increasing as a function of time for a sequence of exposures , suggesting that it is caused by a regular change in the optical path , possibly driven by changes in the environment of the instrument .",
    "these overall shifts have no effect on the measurement of @xmath43 , which depends on the relative offset of line pairs",
    ". however , the shifts also result in differential offsets along the orders and in the cross - dispersed direction ( figure  [ fig : drift ] ) .",
    "the relative offset of the orders as a function of wavelength is shown in figure  [ fig : drift_orders ] for all of our thar pairs .",

    "typical end - to - end wavelength shifts are @xmath45  along the orders though in the most extreme case the value rises to @xmath46 .    under most conditions",
    "these offsets will scatter equally to negative and positive values and contribute only to the systematic errors .",
    "however , depending on the cause of the drift and the observer procedure , they could result in systematic effects .",
    "for example , if the offset were driven by temperature changes , which are more often negative through the night , and if observers normally take thar exposures prior to the on - sky observation , then there could be a systematic shift in @xmath47 .",
    "however we assume here that the offsets simply add to the error budget .",
    "the actual errors will depend on the observing procedure but if we assume that the data are being calibrated with a thar exposure taken 80 minutes away from the observation ( which may be fairly typical ) then we can use the current data to estimate the systematic error . for a system at @xmath48 , the dispersion in the measured offset between 2344  and 2800  corresponds to an r.m.s .",
    "error of @xmath49  in @xmath43  for an individual measurement .",
    "we can also use the night sky lines in the spectra of the quasars to test the accuracy of the final wavelength solution and to check if there are residual distortions in the solution arising from the different optical path followed by the thar calibration lamp versus sky objects illuminating the slit .",
    "since we used a very narrow slit ( in all cases narrower than the typical seeing ) the slit was approximately uniformly illuminated , and the sky lines should provide a good calibration . for our thar wavelength scale we used the average of the wavelength solutions computed from the before and after thar wavelength fits , which should remove much of the drift discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we selected appropriate night sky lines from the list tabulated by @xcite in the wavelength range @xmath50  @xmath51 . to obtain sufficient accuracy , we recalculated the wavelengths of all lines from the term values in @xcite .",

    "the offset is measured from the wavelength position expected from the final wavelength solution , as described above .",

    "@xcite have also found large systematic errors in the hires wavelength calibration between 5000     and 6000   , using the iodine cell to track wavelength shifts , and @xcite , using similar methods , report similar though smaller systematics for the vlt / uves spectrograph . by comparing solar and asteroid spectra , @xcite found wavelength - dependent offsets for uves , though with the opposite slope to our result for hires .    in what follows we used the average thar line measurement for the wavelength solution . in section  [ sec_mg2 ]",
    "we then apply the correction to the wavelength solution based on the sky line fits to correct the measured results so that we can see the comparative size of the effect .",

    "however for the strong lines the statistical error is small and is dominated by the systematic error which is approximately @xmath64 in each individual measurement .",

    "[ fig : lines2 ] , width=374 ]    the simulation technique , which was also used by chand et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , has the advantage of automatically including the effects of continuum fitting and line contamination in the spectrum as well as the effects of non - gaussian noise , and is therefore considerably superior in these respects to estimates that rely on only the local statistical noise to estimate the error .",

    "we have also measured the offset which would be obtained from restricted subsets of the lines . if we include only the and lines we obtain @xmath75 , whereas if we use the , and lines this reduces to a null result of @xmath79 . including the systematic errors discussed in @xcite and section  [ errortest ] would significantly increase the errors from @xmath80  to @xmath81 but still leave a highly significant difference between the fits based on the and lines .",
    "this result shows that there can be serious systematic problems in determining @xmath82 using measurements of just and .",
    "it strongly suggests that , even in a very simple narrow system like the present one , abundance variation in substructure in the sharp feature ( the most likely systematic ) can produce an apparent offset between the species .",
    "zn and cr are well known to have very different abundance patterns , an effect which has traditionally been ascribed to dust depletion but may also reflect variations in nucleosynthesis @xcite . if a positive subcomponent of the narrow absorption line had a high cr / zn ratio relative to a negative subcomponent this could pull the relative offsets of and to negative values .",
    "this is consistent with the observed velocity pattern : the weakly refractory and have the most negative velocities , shown by the filled symbols in figure  [ fig : velshift ] , while the refractory elements ( , , and ) have more consistent positive velocities .",
    "it appears that using with is more secure than using with since both and are refractory elements .",
    "changes in the isotopic mix are unlikely to produce significant changes in the results .",
    "the isotopic effect may be largest in the lines but even here the maximum shift which could be obtained by changing the isotope mix from the local uniform mix of isotopes to being predominantly @xmath83zn is only about @xmath64 , which is small compared with the measured shifts .",
    "as long as @xmath84cr remains the dominant isotope we expect the lines to have relatively small isotopic shifts @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 system has a very similar structure and we adopted the same fitting procedure .",
    "the measured offsets shown in figure  [ fig : velshiftb ] yield a consistent solution for both and relative to , albeit with larger errors for this weaker system .",
    "the regression analysis gives @xmath85 with an acceptable @xmath78 , and consistent results between and and and .",
    "again , including the systematic error from section  [ errortest ] raises the error from @xmath80 to @xmath86 . adopting the values based on , and ions and correcting for the systematic errors , we consider that the most reliable measurements are @xmath87   for the @xmath68  system in he1104@xmath221805a and @xmath88   for the @xmath21  system in hs1946 + 7658",
    ". however , systematic errors remain a concern even when using the more consistent ions and in particular abundance variations may cause velocity shifts .",
    "large numbers of systems would be required to average out the latter effect .",

    "here the fit to all the measured lines gives @xmath89 ( solid line ) , while fitting only and gives @xmath90 ( dotted line ) , and fitting only and gives @xmath91 ( dashed line ) .",

    "we next analysed the eight narrow absorption systems seen in the three quasars .",

    "the lines are separated from neighboring absorption features and at least some of the lines are strong enough for accurate measurements . the doublet ratio can be used to estimate the degree of saturation , and there are four systems in which the lines appear unsaturated and four in which at least the lines show saturation effects .",

    "when we correct for the wavelength bias discussed in section  [ skycal ] and for the systematic errors discussed in section  [ errortest ] this becomes @xmath96 .",

    "mm measurements of the evolution of the fine structure constant are generally based on either comparison of and lines or ( at higher redshifts ) on measurements of , , and lines .",
    "both have significant problems which have to be dealt with in order to obtain an accurate limit .    in the case of the widely separated and lines",
    ", extreme care must be taken in the wavelength calibration .",
    "as has previously been discussed in @xcite , we see drift in the hires wavelength calibration with time together with a significant systematic error in the thar calibration of each order of the spectrum and , using the sky lines as a calibrator , a significant linear deviation between the sky line based calibration and the thar line calibration . the latter effect will produce a negative deviation in the measurement of @xmath4 for hires observations .",
    "the exact shift depends on the redshift and line pair used but is around @xmath97 for typical observations and would reduce the significance of the @xcite evolution from @xmath98 to about @xmath99 , assuming that the sky offset on hires remains at a fixed level over the course of time and has not changed between the observations of @xcite and those presented here .",
    "similar effects have been noted for the uves spectrograph on the vlt @xcite . in particular , @xcite found wavelength - dependent offsets of a similar magnitude to those discussed here for hires by comparing solar and asteroid spectra in the wavelength range 3300 3900 .",
    "however , these offsets vary with wavelength in the opposite sense to the slope we find for hires , and so will produce a positive deviation .",
    "if a consistent negative slope is found in further tests of the hires wavelength accuracy , the opposite signs of the hires and uves observations could provide a natural explanation of the apparent spatial variation in @xmath0  claimed by @xcite .",
    "we have measured the variation using our present high s / n and high resolution observations of eight systems in and , obtaining a value of @xmath100 when we correct for the systematic bias and allow for systematic errors in the line fitting .",
    "this null result is consistent with most previous measurements using a variety of techniques .",
    "measurements based on the neighboring lines of , etc . occur in higher column density systems where abundance variation in unresolved subcomponents can cause measurement errors . in the present work we have argued that , and",
    "may give the most robust results for @xmath4 and that and measurements should be avoided . using the and measurements for two weak and narrow systems we found limits of @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath4 when we allow for systematic wavelength calibration errors .",
    "combining the and results with the and results gives us a final null result of @xmath103 .",
