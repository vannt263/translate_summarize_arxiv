    "the be / x - ray binaries represent the largest subclass of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "about two - thirds of the identified systems fall into this category .",
    "these systems consist of a be star ( i.e. , a b star with an equatorial disc ) and , generally , a neutron star .",
    "the orbit is wide ( several tens of days @xmath2 several hundred days ) and eccentric ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "most of the be / x - ray binaries show only transient x - ray activity due to transient accretion of the circumstellar matter of the be star , while some show persistent x - ray emission . each be / x - ray binary exhibits some or all of the following three types of x - ray activity :    1 .",
    "periodic ( type  i ) x - ray outbursts , coinciding with periastron passage ( @xmath4 ) , 2 .",
    "giant ( type  ii ) x - ray outbursts ( @xmath5 ) , which show no clear orbital modulation , 3 .",
    "persistent low - luminosity x - ray emission ( @xmath6 )    ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these features imply a complicated interaction between the be - star envelope and the neutron star .",
    "a be star has a two - component extended atmosphere , a polar region and a cool ( @xmath7 ) equatorial disc .",
    "the polar region consists of a low - density , fast ( @xmath8 ) outflow emitting uv radiation .",
    "the wind structure is well explained by the so - called line - driven wind model , in which the radiative acceleration results from the scattering of the stellar radiation in an ensemble of spectral lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , the equatorial disc , which is geometrically thin and nearly keplerian , consists of a high - density plasma from which the optical emission lines and the ir excess arise .",
    "the radial velocity of the disc is smaller than a few @xmath9 , at least within @xmath10 stellar radii ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although there is no widely accepted model for discs around be stars , the viscous decretion disc model proposed by @xcite explains many of the observed features and thus seems promising ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the matter supplied from the equatorial surface of the star drifts outwards because of the viscous effect and forms the disc .",
    "the basic equations for viscous decretion discs are the same as those for viscous accretion discs , except that the sign of @xmath11 ( mass decretion / accretion rate ) is opposite .",
    "the boundary conditions for decretion discs , however , are different from those for accretion discs",
    ". therefore , the decretion disc has a structure different from that of the accretion disc @xcite .    until quite recently",
    ", models for type  i x - ray outbursts in be / x - ray binaries had assumed a large disc around the be star so that the neutron star can accrete gas when it passes through the disc near periastron .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite recently performed a semi - analytical study based on the viscous decretion disc model for be stars and showed that the be disc in be / x - ray binaries is truncated at a radius smaller than the periastron distance , as long as @xmath0 , where @xmath12 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bex ] for a schematic view of a be / x - ray binary ) .",
    "the truncation of the disc is due to the resonant torque exerted by the neutron star , which removes the angular momentum from the disc .",
    "the disc radii they obtained for seven particular systems ( 4u0115 + 63 , v0332 + 53 , a0535 + 262 , exo2030 + 375 , 2s1417@xmath13624 , groj1008@xmath1357 , and 2s1417@xmath13624 ) are consistent with the x - ray behaviour of those systems . moreover , the result is in agreement with the result of @xcite that there is a positive correlation between the orbital size and the maximum equivalent width of h@xmath14 ever observed in a system , a measure of the maximum disc size around the be star in the system .",
    "the truncation of the be disc in be / x - ray binaries is not surprising .",
    "the resonant interaction is important in various contexts even in a fly - by encounter with a perturber . in fly - by encounters between a disc galaxy and a point mass perturber ,",
    "the energy is always transported from the disc to the perturber through the resonant interaction , except for overhead encounters where the energy transfer is small @xcite . in distant encounters between a circumstellar accretion disc and a perturbing mass with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the periastron distance and disc radius , respectively , the disc material loses energy and angular momentum to the perturber s orbit through a resonance feature @xcite .    in the case of",
    "be / x - ray binaries , the surface density of the be disc is expected to increase more rapidly than that for isolated be stars , as a consequence of truncation .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with the result found by @xcite that the be discs in be / x - ray binaries are about twice as dense as those around isolated be stars .",
    "the disc may finally become optically thick , and become unstable to radiation - driven warping ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "multi - wavelength , long - term monitoring observations of v635  cas , the optical counterpart of 4u0115 + 63 , revealed that the be disc in 4u0115 + 63 undergoes a quasi - cyclic ( @xmath18 ) dynamical evolution @xcite : after each disc - loss episode , the disc starts reforming , grows until it becomes unstable to warping , and after that a type  ii outburst occurs .",
    "although a direct link between the warped disc and the type  ii outburst is still missing , the dynamical evolution of the be disc is likely to be the agent that controls the x - ray behaviour of the system .",
    "this way , the truncated disc model , at least qualitatively , explains many of the observed features of be / x - ray binaries . the semi - analytical model adopted by @xcite and @xcite , however , only compares the resonant torque integrated over the whole orbit with the viscous torque to determine at which radius the disc is truncated .",
    "hence , it can not make a quantitative prediction about how perfect or imperfect the truncation is .",
    "moreover , it predicts nothing about phase - dependent features , such as the disc deformation and the change in the mass capture rate .",
    "therefore , in order to study the efficiency of the resonant truncation and the orbital - phase dependence of the interaction , we simulate the interaction between the be - star disc and the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , using a 3d sph code . in a general context",
    ", such simulations will also enable us to study the interaction between the viscous disc and the companion in an eccentric orbit . in this paper , which is the first of a series of papers dedicated to understanding the interaction between the",
    "be disc and the neutron star , we study the effects of viscosity on disc truncation in a coplanar system .",
    "simulations presented here were performed with a three - dimensional , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "the sph code is based on a version originally developed by benz ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the smoothing length is variable in time and space .",
    "the code uses a tree structure to calculate the nearest neighbours of particles .",
    "the sph equations with the standard cubic spline kernel are integrated using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator with individual time steps for each particle @xcite , which results in an enormous computational saving when a large range of dynamical time - scales are involved .    in our code , the be disc is modelled by an ensemble of gas particles , each of which has a negligible mass chosen to be @xmath19 with a variable smoothing length . for simplicity",
    ", the gas particles are assumed to be isothermal at the temperature of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the effective temperature of the be star . on the other hand ,",
    "the be star and the neutron star are modelled by two sink particles @xcite with corresponding masses .",
    "gas particles which fall within a specified accretion radius are accreted by the sink particle .",
    "we assume that the be star has the accretion radius of @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the radius of the be star . for the neutron star",
    ", we adopt a variable accretion radius of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the roche - lobe radius for a circular binary .",
    "this is because having a small accretion radius is time - consuming and it is unphysical to adopt an accretion radius smaller than the smoothing length of the particles near the disc outer radius .",
    "an approximate formula for @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the mass ratio @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the masses of neutron star and be star , respectively , and the distance between the stars , @xmath30 .",
    "the sph artificial viscosity , @xmath31 , between particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 enters the momentum equation as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity , @xmath36 is the mass , @xmath37 is the pressure , @xmath38 is the density , @xmath39 is the standard cubic spline kernel , @xmath40 is the distance between particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath41 is the mean of the smoothing lengths of particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath31 has the following standard form , @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the linear and nonlinear artificial viscosity parameters , respectively , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .    in the continuum limit ,",

    "the strength of the mode in the steady state is larger for a smaller value of @xmath12 .    on the other hand , in the high - resolution simulation with @xmath72 ,",
    "the eccentric mode undergoes prograde precession at some point .",
    "the precession period is about @xmath294 .",
    "the precession rate is not constant .",
    "it accelerates for @xmath295 and decelerates for @xmath296 , where @xmath188 is the angle between the eccentric vector of the disc and that of the binary orbit .",
    "the precession rate is radius - dependent . it is larger at a larger radius .",
    "since the eccentric mode is leading for @xmath297 and trailing for @xmath298 , the twist of the mode increases with time for @xmath295 and decreases for @xmath298 .",
    "the strength of the eccentric mode , which anti - correlates with the twist of the mode , decreases for @xmath295 and increases for @xmath299 .    as the mode precesses , the mass capture rate , @xmath253 , by the neutron star modulates .",
    "it is a maximum at @xmath300 .",
    "even for an eccentricity of 0.1 , @xmath253 at maximum is about a factor of three higher than the level before precession .",
    "if the disc had a much stronger disturbance , the enhancement in @xmath253 is likely to be much larger .",
    "such a system may temporarily show periodic x - ray outbursts .    in our model for be / x - ray binaries , in which the disc material overflows toward the neutron star via the @xmath301 point , the mass capture rate by the neutron star becomes strongly phase dependent . the dependence is stronger for a smaller value of viscosity . in the disc with @xmath72 ,",
    "the mass capture rate decreases by two orders of magnitude between periastron and apastron passages , and after apastron passage , no disc mass is captured by the neutron star . note",
    "that our model gives a much stronger contrast in the mass capture rate than that expected for the stellar wind accretion .",
    "we have also compared the simulated mass capture rate with the observed x - ray behaviour of 4u0115 + 63 , considering two extreme situations , in which @xmath279 or @xmath288 , where @xmath281 is the accretion time - scale .",
    "we found that the disc model for @xmath72 gives a result consistent with the observation for both situations , whereas the higher viscosity models for @xmath105 and 0.3 are ruled out unless @xmath280 .",
    "analysing multi - wavelength long - term monitoring observations of 4u0115 + 63 , @xcite found that the be star undergoes quasi - cyclic ( @xmath302 ) activity , losing and reforming its circumstellar disc .",
    "they also found that , at some point , the growing disc becomes unstable to warping and then tilts and starts precessing .",
    "type ii x - ray outbursts take place after the warping episode . as shown in this paper",
    ", our @xmath72 model explains many of the observed features of 4u0115 + 63 in the phase before the warping occurs .",
    "our simulation , however , showed no dynamical instability , and therefore is incapable of explaining the warping episode . including the effect of radiation from the be star may turn out to be essential to have a model that explains the whole cycle of the disc evolution , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    in this paper , we have concentrated our study on the viscous effects on star - disc interaction in a coplanar system with fixed orbital period and eccentricity .",
    "this was done not only as a first step to have a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the be disc and the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , but also to have an archetypal model with which we can compare the results from our future simulations . in the next paper , we will study the effects of the misalignment angles between the be disc and the binary . we will discuss the effects of the orbital eccentricity in the third paper , and the fourth paper will conclude the series by studying the effects of the orbital period .",

    "<S> we find that the be - star disc is effectively truncated if the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath0 , which confirms the previous semi - analytical result . in the truncated disc , the material decreted from the be star accumulates , so that the disc becomes denser more rapidly than if around an isolated be star . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant truncation of the be disc results in a significant reduction of the amount of gas captured by the neutron star and a strong dependence of the mass capture rate on the orbital phase . </S>",
