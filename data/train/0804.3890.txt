    "the response of noisy nonlinear systems driven by weak external driving terms is frequently analyzed with the powerful tools of linear response theory ( lrt)@xcite . the amplification of the amplitude of the average response with the noise strength as well as the non - monotonic behaviors of the amplitude and of the output signal - to - noise ratio are manifestations of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "these behaviors have been indeed rationalized using the ideas of lrt @xcite . within the linear regime described by lrt",
    ", the response of the non - linear system is necessarily very noisy .",
    "the output noise level is much higher and the decay time of the fluctuations much longer than those present in a linear system subject to the same noise and driving terms .",
    "consequently , the signal - to - noise ratio of the nonlinear system in that regime is very small , even at its peak value , and the gain does not exceed unity @xcite .",
    "if one is interested in obtaining large average amplitudes and large signal - to - noise ratio , one must find a way to control the output fluctuations and this is only possible in a nonlinear regime .",
    "a possible way to reduce the output fluctuation levels in noise induced sr is to use external driving terms with amplitudes so large that , even though they are still subthreshold , they alter significantly the potential relief of the dynamics and render invalid the lrt assumptions @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to concentrate on the global response of a set of nonlinear oscillators . in @xcite",
    "the enhancement of sr effects in arrays of bistable systems were studied .",
    "more recently @xcite , we have analyzed the collective response of a finite set of globally coupled bistable systems .",
    "we demonstrated that sr is indeed much enhanced with respect to sr in single bistable units .",
    "indeed , gains larger than unity were observed for subthreshold sinusoidal driving forces .",
    "those findings indicated that the arrays were indeed operating in nonlinear regimes .",
    "another aspect of the stochastic response of the system refers to its noise induced synchronization with the driving term . by a suitable definition of a phase associated to the random output process , one can define an output average phase frequency and a phase dispersion .",
    "the matching of the phase frequency with the driving frequency for a range of noise values is what is termed noise induced frequency synchronization .",
    "it has been analyzed with a variety of analytical and numerical procedures @xcite , even in circumstances where quantum tunneling effects are relevant @xcite . in @xcite noise",
    "induced phase synchronization of the collective variable for wide ranges of noise values were also observed when the array was driven by subthreshold inputs .",
    "the results reported in the above mentioned work were obtained with driving terms that , even though they were unable to produce the cited effects in the absence of noise , they were large enough to invalidate lrt when applied to a single bistable system .",
    "the question we address in the present work is whether the enhancement of sr and synchronization effects in the collective response of finite arrays of bistable units still persist when the driving external force is rather weak . by weak , we will mean here that : i ) the sr effects induced by the external driving in a single bistable unit can be satisfactorily described , even at a quantitative level , by the lrt approximation ; and ii ) noise induced phase frequency synchronization in a single bistable unit does not properly exist .    in the next section , we introduce the model system and define the relevant quantities that characterize the phenomenon of sr and phase synchronization . in section [ results ]",
    "we show the results obtained by numerically solving the dynamical stochastic equations .",
    "comparison with the predictions of recently formulated approximate descriptions of the collective dynamics @xcite is carried out in section iv .",
    "the last section concludes with some remarks .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 identical subsystems , each of them characterized by a variable @xmath1 satisfying a stochastic evolution equation ( in dimensionless form ) of the type @xcite @xmath2 the external driving force is periodic in @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents a white noise with zero average and @xmath6 .",
    "we define a collective variable , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and concentrate on its long time response when the system size , @xmath0 , is kept finite and the amplitude of the driving term is weak ( in the sense that when the driving force acts on a single isolated unit , sr is well described by linear response theory ) . we define the one - time correlation function , @xmath9 the notation @xmath10 indicates an average over the noise realizations and the subindex @xmath11 indicates the long time limit of the noise average , i. e. , its value after waiting for @xmath3 large enough that transients have died out . as shown in our previous work , @xcite we have that @xmath12 = c_{coh}(\\tau ) + \\frac 1n c_{incoh}(\\tau).\\ ] ] where the coherent part , @xmath13 , is periodic in @xmath14 with the period of the driving force , while the incoherent part , @xmath15 arising from the fluctuations of the output @xmath7 around its average value , decays to zero as @xmath14 increases .",
    "the output signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fundamental frequency of the driving force @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the corresponding fourier coefficient in the fourier series expansion of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the fourier transform at frequency @xmath23 of @xmath24 .    for a set of @xmath0 coupled linear oscillators driven by an external driving force @xmath19 and subject to the noise terms @xmath5 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) , the snr of the corresponding collective process , @xmath25 , coincides with that of the random process formed by the arithmetic mean of the individual noise terms @xmath5 plus the deterministic driving force @xmath19 , namely , @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",

    "the snr of the collective output is @xmath0 times larger than that of a isolated unit driven by the same force .",
    "nonetheless , as discussed in @xcite , the gain associated to the collective output is just the same as the one of a single , isolated , unit .",
    "thus , for the weak forces that we are considering here , we expect that the collective gain will not exceed unity .",
    "as seen below , our numerical results will confirm that result .",
    "another aspect of the response is the noise induced phase frequency synchronization .",
    "we note that for low noise strengths and driving forces with sufficiently large periods , a random trajectory of @xmath7 contains essentially small fluctuations around two values ( attractors ) and random , sporadic transitions between them . for each realization of the noise term",
    ", we then introduce a random phase process , @xmath34 , associated to the stochastic variable @xmath7 as follows .",
    "we refer to a `` jump '' of @xmath7 along a trajectory , when a very large fluctuation takes the @xmath7 trajectory from a value near an attractor to a value in the neighborhood of the other attractor .",
    "we count @xmath35 , the number of jumps in the @xmath36 trajectory of the process @xmath7 within the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "a trajectory of the phase process is then constructed as @xmath38 so that @xmath34 increases by @xmath39 after every two consecutive jumps .",
    "the first two moments of the phase process are estimated as @xmath40 @xmath41 ^ 2\\right\\rangle -\\left\\langle \\phi(t)\\right\\rangle^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\mathcal m } \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\mathcal m } \\left[\\phi^{(\\alpha)}(t)\\right]^2-\\frac{1}{\\mathcal m^2 } \\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\mathcal m } \\phi^{(\\alpha)}(t)\\right]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath42 is the number of generated random trajectories .",
    "the instantaneous phase frequency is easily determined from the time derivative of @xmath43 .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of periods of the driving force , @xmath44 , the system forgets its initial preparation , but the instantaneous phase frequency is still a function of time .",

    "those expressions can not be applied to the collective variable of an @xmath0-particle problem ,",
    "in general , nonlinearities preclude exact analytical solutions of eqs .",

    "we will use numerical simulations to obtain useful information about the stochastic process @xmath7 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath50 ,",
    "desai and zwanzig showed that the statistical properties of the model could be analyzed in terms of a nonlinear fokker - planck equation which allows the coexistence of several stable probability distributions for some ranges of noise strengths and @xmath51 . in the same asymptotic limit",
    ", we analyzed a few years ago the stochastic resonant behavior of the first moment , @xmath52 , when the system is driven by a time dependent sinusoidal force , using a combination of analytical and numerical procedures @xcite .",
    "in particular , for very weak input amplitudes , a linear response theory analysis showed that a huge amplification in the amplitude of the average output @xmath52 with respect to that of the driving force could be achieved .",
    "in this work we concentrate on situations where : i ) the number of subunits is finite ; ii ) the amplitude of the driving force is rather weak .",

    "the dependence of the initial value of the corresponding incoherent part @xmath76 with @xmath71 is shown .",
    "one observes that both quantities show non - monotonic behaviors with the coupling strength .",
    "even though the peak in the lower panel and the minimum in the higher panel are obtained for @xmath69 , the largest signal - to - noise ratio is reached at the slightly larger coupling strength @xmath74 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cinco ] , the decay of the incoherent part of the correlation function at @xmath74 is faster than at the other coupling values .",
    "indeed , the key behavior is that of the incoherent part of the correlation function .",

    "the driving force in all cases is a rectangular input with amplitude @xmath61 and fundamental frequency @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that for this weak driving force and for a single unit system , the range of noise values at which the phase frequency matches the driving fundamental frequency is extremely narrow to consider that there is a proper synchronization . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath65 coupled particles , the range of noise values leading to proper frequency matching and small phase diffusion coefficients is substantial .",
    "optimum synchronization is obtained for @xmath74 with a dip at the diffusion constant for @xmath82 .",

    "note that as the value of @xmath71 increases above @xmath78 , the range of noise values for synchronization to take place reduces and it shifts to higher values of @xmath60 .",
    "perhaps , the most surprising result is that for uncoupled units , synchronization between the collective variable and the driving term is lost .",
    "this is indeed in sharp contrast with the results reported in @xcite for the same system with a driving force with a much larger amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "the range of noise values for stochastic resonance and noise induced phase synchronization do not have to coincide .",

    "does the gaussian approximation lead to results in good agreement with those obtained from the full set of equations .",

    "has the attractive feature of reducing the dynamics for the collective variable to a single langevin equation in a one - dimensional potential .",
    "unfortunately , by contrast with the parameter values for @xmath71 and @xmath60 considered in those works , for the parameter values used here the effective potential evaluated as indicated in the above mentioned references might not be bounded or it might not even exist .",

    "<S> we analyze the stochastic response of a finite set of globally coupled noisy bistable units driven by rather weak time - periodic forces . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the stochastic resonance and phase frequency synchronization of the collective variable , defined as the arithmetic mean of the variable characterizing each element of the array . for single unit systems , </S>",
    "<S> stochastic resonance can be understood with the powerful tools of linear response theory . </S>",
    "<S> proper noise induced phase frequency synchronization for a single unit system in this linear response regime does not exist . for coupled arrays , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations indicate an enhancement of the stochastic resonance effects leading to gains larger than unity as well as genuine phase frequency synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> the non - monotonicity of the response with the strength of the coupling strength is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with simplifying schemes proposed in the literature to describe the random response of the collective variable is carried out . </S>"
