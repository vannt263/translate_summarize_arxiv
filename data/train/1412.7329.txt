    "@xcite we observed that only the magnetic field component perpendicular to the superconducting @xmath20 plane gives rise to an enhanced ic scattering , whereas the field component in the plane does not affect the magnetic ic signal .",
    "further , the field - induced intensity was modulated along the @xmath18-axis , indicating that inter - planar spin correlations develop in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "the observation of enhanced @xmath18-axis correlations raises a concern : parts of , or in principle all of , the field - induced signal observed in measurements using the more common @xmath20 plane crystal orientation may be due to the induced correlations , and not to an increase of static magnetism in the superconductor , as commonly believed . in the present work ,",
    "we perform a comprehensive study of the field - induced signal of a lsco crystal of a slightly larger doping level , @xmath21 .",
    "our results confirm the earlier findings of both field - induced magnetism and field - induced @xmath18-axis correlations in this system . in particular , we find that much of the observed ic signal in our experiments arises from an actual increase of magnetism in the system .",

    "the resolution ellipsoid is elongated out of the scattering plane .",
    "this means that in common experiments , where the @xmath20 plane is in the scattering plane , the intensity is enhanced by resolution integration along the @xmath18-axis , along which the ic signal is broad . in the present crystal alignment with the @xmath18-axis in the scattering plane",
    "we do not gain intensity by these resolution effects and optimization of the experimental setup is required .",
    "sample rotation scans are optimal in this situation since this limits distinct background contributions from e.g. powder lines arising from 2nd and 3rd order neutrons reflected by the monochromator .",

    "the effect of applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the copper oxide planes is twofold .",
    "first , weak correlations between the cuo@xmath4 planes develop in agreement with the observations of lake _",
    "et al . _ in lsco @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite secondly , and more pronounced , an overall enhancement of the magnetic signal takes place for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "a fit of the field data to three gaussians with same width and fixed centers at @xmath59 and @xmath32 gives a broad modulation with @xmath60 r.l.u .",
    "this corresponds to a very short correlation length of 4  , smaller than the distance between neighboring cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "as a measure of the true enhanced intensity we integrate the signal measured in field along @xmath5 and compare to the @xmath5-integrated zero - field signal . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_ritaandflexx ] we get an @xmath5-integrated enhanced intensity of @xmath61% . for a comparison",
    "we calculate the enhancement effect at @xmath52 from fig .",

    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_panda ] we show the results of the panda experiment , which was done at zero field , but under different experimental conditions since the crystal was quenched - cooled by 4  k / min .",
    "we observe a small correlation between the cuo@xmath4 planes even when no magnetic field is applied . in this case",
    "a fit to a gaussian function at even @xmath5 gives a width of @xmath63 r.l.u .",
    "similar to the broad modulation observed in field .",
    "this leaves us with the interesting observation that quench - cooling has the same qualitative effect of enhancing inter - planar correlations as the application of an external magnetic field in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "in the previous section we reported that @xmath18-axis correlations are absent when the system is cooled slowly from room temperature to base temperature .",
    "further , we observed that a magnetic field as well as quench - cooling can lead to the development of clear , but short - range , @xmath18-axis correlations .",
    "now we turn to a discussion of the magnetic signal and how it is affected by an applied magnetic field and quench - cooling the system .",
    "finally , we discuss our experimental findings in the framework of theoretical microscopic models .",
    "we observe an ic signal at all values of @xmath5 in field as well as in zero field . in field",
    "the position is at @xmath64 with a weak @xmath5 dependence as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ritadata ]  ( c ) . under the assumption that this ic signal belongs to the dominating structural twin",
    ", the mean ic position corresponds to a displacement angle of @xmath65 away from the high symmetry axis of the underlying cuo@xmath4 plane .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of kimura _",
    "et al._@xcite on a crystal of similar doping . in zero field",
    "the mean peak position is the same as in field with a slightly larger uncertainty due to the very weak signal . in zero field",
    "there is no discernible variation in peak position along @xmath5 .",
    "the signal structure along the @xmath5 direction for different twin components of the ic order in lsco has not been measured previously .",
    "our expectations stem from the parent compound la@xmath4cuo@xmath2@xcite and super - oxygenated la@xmath4cuo@xmath66.@xcite the parent compound la@xmath4cuo@xmath2 displays long - range three - dimensional antiferromagnetic order with spins aligned mainly along the orthorhombic @xmath67-axis .  @xcite with this spin structure the magnetic signal is peaked at _ even _",
    "@xmath5 for scattering at @xmath68 and at _ odd _",
    "@xmath5 for scattering at @xmath69 . in the work by lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the three - dimensionality of the ic signal in super - oxygenated la@xmath4cuo@xmath66 was investigated .",
    "a clear splitting of the incommensurate signal allowed measurements of ic signals centered at @xmath68 and @xmath69 simultaneously .",
    "lee and coworkers report a broad @xmath5-dependence of the ic signals ; for the ic signal centered at @xmath68 the peak is at even @xmath5 while it occurs for odd @xmath5 for the ic signal centered at @xmath69 .",
    "thus in la@xmath4cuo@xmath66 the arrangement of the spins in the inter - planar direction bear resemblance to the spin arrangement in the parent compound with the spins being correlated across two to three cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "@xcite    in our case the orthorhombicity of the crystal is much smaller than in la@xmath4cuo@xmath66 which makes it harder to identify a possible twinning of the ic signal . from scans through the structural peaks",
    "three structural domains are visible as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ritadata ]  ( c ) .",
    "the sub - dominant second order peak close to @xmath70 is displaced from the dominant peak by @xmath71 % in both directions .",
    "this corresponds to a rotation of @xmath72 between the two twins . in ref .",
    "the twin splitting was reported to be @xmath73 .    by a rotation of @xmath74 and a rescaling of the vector length , the structural peak of the dominant twin",
    "is brought to the same position as the structural peak of the sub - dominant twin . performing the same transformation on the ic peak at @xmath75",
    "we might expect an ic twin at the position @xmath76 .",
    "this predicts a larger deviation in peak center than expected from the lower value of the fitted peak center shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ritadata ]  ( c ) for @xmath42 which is @xmath77 .",
    "note , however , that the difference in peak position is of the order of the resolution limitation of @xmath50 r.l.u .. therefore , it is likely that resolution limitations cause both ic twin signals to contribute for all values of @xmath5 with one twin @xmath75 dominating at even @xmath5 and the other twin dominates for odd @xmath5 .",
    "we measure the ic signal centered at @xmath68 defined with respect to the dominant structural domain .",
    "if the magnetic structure of lco is partially maintained also in its sr - doped offspring we expect inter - planar correlations from the dominant twin to be peaked at even @xmath5 . by resolution effects the ic signals from the two sub - dominant structural twins",
    "are also picked up , and since these are both centered at @xmath69 part of the signal will be peaked at odd @xmath5 .    as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_ritaandflexx ] and  [ fig : ampl_vs_l_panda ] , the largest component of the signal shows a peak at even @xmath5 , but as proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3scan ]  ( b ) we might expect part of the signal to be peaked at odd @xmath5 . if the signal was peaked only at even @xmath5 a fit to two gaussians ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_ritaandflexx ] ) is appropriate .",
    "however , if part of the signal is peaked at odd @xmath5 , the data should rather be fitted to three gaussians as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_ritaandflexx ] by the red curve . in this interpretation",
    "the correlations along the @xmath5 direction is equally well - developed for all twins , so the width of the gaussian at @xmath42 is equal to the width at @xmath52 and @xmath32 . since the twin which shows correlations peaked at even @xmath5 is more pronounced than the twins with correlations peaked at odd @xmath5 we see only the peaks at even @xmath52 and @xmath32 whereas the peak at @xmath42 is masked by the tails of the other two . due to the broadness of the signals the peak position is an average over both twins at all values of @xmath5 which is",
    "probably why we observe only a very small shift in the peak center at odd @xmath5 compared to even @xmath5 .",
    "our observations are consistent with this picture .      from the two independent field experiments done at rita - ii and flexx we find that the ic signal at @xmath78 is enhanced by a magnetic field at all values of @xmath5 , but in particular for even @xmath5 .",
    "the results of both experiments agree on the magnitude of the magnetic field enhancement at even @xmath5 which is close to a factor of two in both cases .",
    "although the flexx experiment provided less data points , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_ritaandflexx ] that both experiments agree on the development of weak inter - planar correlations in a field as reflected in the @xmath5-dependence of the amplitude of the ic intensities .",
    "the peaks which are centered at even values of @xmath5 are very broad and the correlation length is smaller than the inter - planar distance of @xmath79  .",
    "this deviates from the correlation length of more than @xmath80   as found in ref .   for lsco @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the correlation length determined in ref",
    ".   is likely uncertain due to the sparse data .",
    "however , we can not rule out a real difference in the field - induced inter - planar correlation length between these two crystals of different doping levels .",
    "since our crystal displays enhanced magnetic order in zero field compared to smaller doping values , it might be harder to change the inter - planar correlations by a field .",
    "the primary effect of an applied magnetic field is to enhance the magnetic signal either by enlarging the magnetic volume fraction or the ordered magnetic moments .",
    "our neutron scattering experiment does not allow for distinguishing between these two possible scenarios .",
    "muon spin rotation studies on the same crystal show that magnetic order is present throughout the entire volume of the sample with a resolution of 20   given by the range of sight of the muons inside the sample  @xcite and we conclude that the main effect arises from enlargening of the ordered magnetic moments",
    ".    in addition , development of weak inter - planar correlations occurs as a response to the applied magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "the field effect reported in the literature on magnetism in the cuprates that has been measured in the usual configuration @xmath31 must be re - interpreted .",
    "a common interpretation of the field effect has been that it increases either the magnetic moments or the magnetic volume fraction . in the @xmath31 setup",
    "this effect is either over - estimated or under - estimated , depending on whether the dominant ic peak belongs to a `` @xmath81 '' or `` @xmath82 '' ic quartet . for our crystal measuring at the ic peak at @xmath83 with @xmath31 would cause an over - estimation of the field effect . at",
    "the amplitude enhancement is roughly @xmath84% whereas the real increase of magnetic order measured from the @xmath5-averaged intensity is only @xmath85% .",
    "thus the field effect is over - estimated by 30% .",
    "another new finding in this work is the fact that inter - planar correlations are also found in zero field under different experimental conditions where the crystal is quench - cooled from room temperature down to base temperature below 4  k. in contrast to the experiments on rita - ii and flexx , where the structural phase transition as well as the ordering of possible excess oxygen were traversed slowly , both processes were passed extremely fast in the panda zero - field experiment .",
    "this is likely to have resulted in finite inter - planar correlations as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl_vs_l_panda ] , qualitatively similar to the result of an applied magnetic field .    to understand this behaviour",
    ", we first compare our sample to super - oxygenated crystals where the excess oxygen order in a three - dimensional structure upon slow cooling .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that fast cooling leads to an oxygen - disordered state displaying enhanced spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order compared to the oxygen - ordered state .",
    "in fact , in this work it was observed that disordering the excess oxygen has the same enhancement effect of the sdw signal as the application of a 7.5 t field .",
    "however , it remains unknown how disordered oxygen ions or applied magnetic field affect the magnetic correlations between the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "in general , the cooling history is known to be important for the strength of the ic signal and reproducibility of the signal strength is obtained only when cooling slowly through the transition temperature of the oxygen - ordered state .",
    "sensitivity to the cooling procedure is also likely to exist in the sr - doped samples , even though this has been less discussed in the literature .",
    "following this line of thought we put forward two possible explanations for our observations in 12 % doped lsco .",
    "first , our sample might have a small amount of excess oxygen since this is not easily avoided during crystal growth .",
    "fast cooling through the temperature regime where ordering of possible excess oxygen takes place , which occurs down to @xmath86  k , might cause random positions of the excess oxygen ions .",
    "such impurities could act as pinning centers enhancing the magnetic correlations between the planes .",
    "second , the crystal has a tendency towards domain formation when cooled through the structural transition from high - temperature - tetragonal ( htt ) to low - temperature - orthorombic ( lto ) at @xmath87  k.  @xcite domains form in the ( @xmath88 ) plane due to the small difference of these two lattice constants in the orthorhombic phase . when slowly cooled , the crystal shows at three discernible domains out of four possible .",
    "the fast cooling procedure done in the panda experiment might change this domain formation and result in a different twin pattern , which is likely to contain a larger number of smaller domains than with slow cooling .",
    "these domains could act as pinning centers along the inter - planar direction since they penetrate the sample through this direction .",
    "such a pinning center that penetrates the sample perpendicular to the cuo@xmath4 planes might result in enhanced correlations along this direction in a similar way as pinning centers arising from vortices in an applied field .",
    "theoretically , the slowing down and subsequent pinning of static magnetic order by disorder sites and twin boundaries,@xcite and vortices@xcite has been previously discussed extensively in the literature . from the microscopic studies ,",
    "it is clear that the modulations of charge density and/or electron hopping amplitudes induced by impurities and twin boundaries can lead to local magnetic instabilities which nucleate magnetic order in the vicinity of the perturbing sites .",
    "the vortices , on the other hand , typically induce local magnetic order due to the suppressed superconducting gap and an associated enhanced local density of states near the fermi level in the cores .",
    "it has been shown that even in strongly disordered situations vortices enhance the in - plane magnetic moments.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , the out - of - plane induced magnetic order by disorder or by vortices has not been described by microscopic models , and constitute an interesting future study . for the pure superconducting system , flux lines along the @xmath18-axis should lead to substantially enhanced spin correlations along @xmath5.@xcite the weak coupling between the cuo@xmath4 planes will lead to short - ranged vortex - induced magnetic order , but the extremely short @xmath18-axis correlations found here points to additional effects . certainly , the full magnetic volume fraction already in zero field indicates that there is hardly any `` room '' for vortices to induce coherent spin correlations along the @xmath18-axis . instead",
    ", the vortices lead to local enhancements of the magnetic moments and presumably adapt to the many pre - existing pinning centers and strongly meander along @xmath18 , leading to only very weak @xmath18-axis field - induced correlations in qualitative agreement with our observations . within this scenario , higher doped samples with less static magnetic order in zero field , should lead to longer - ranged and more pronounced @xmath18-axis correlations in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we have studied the field dependence of the inter - planar magnetic correlations in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the primary effect of an applied magnetic field is an enhancement of the magnetic moments .",
    "further , there is an effect of increased inter - planar correlations in the presence of an applied field .",
    "the inter - planar correlation length is very small and imply correlations only between neighbouring planes .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic order is already strongly pinned by impurities in the sample and that vortices tend to bend rather than go perpendicular to the cuo@xmath4 planes on the way through the sample .",
    "we observe that a fast cooling procedure results in the same feature as application of a magnetic field , namely development of weak inter - planar correlations .",
    "two possible scenarios - caused by excess oxygen or micro - domains - could lead to pinning of the magnetic order between the cuo@xmath4 planes thereby explaining why a quench - cooled system behaves similarly as a system subjected to an external field .",

    "<S> we present neutron scattering studies of the inter - planar correlations in the high - temperature superconductor la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( @xmath3 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations are studied both in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the cuo@xmath4 planes , and in zero field under different cooling conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effect of the magnetic field is to increase the magnetic scattering signal at all values of the out - of - plane wave vector @xmath5 , indicating an overall increase of the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , weak correlations between the copper oxide planes develop in the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is not taken into account in previous reports on the field effect of magnetic scattering , since usually only @xmath6 is probed . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the results of quench - cooling the sample are similar to those obtained by applying a magnetic field . finally , a small variation of the incommensurate peak position as a function of @xmath5 provides evidence that the incommensurate signal is twinned with the dominating and sub - dominant twin displaying peaks at even or odd @xmath5 , respectively . </S>"
