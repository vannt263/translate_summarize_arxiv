    "the algorithm shows how quickly convex subsets grow in networks .",
    "it resembles the cluster growing approach used as a counterexample in the study of fractal networks  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we here do not restrict the maximum distance between the nodes .",
    "the nodes in @xmath0 can be on any distance as long as @xmath0 is a convex subset .    before looking at the results , it is instructive to consider the evolution of @xmath0 in the first steps of the algorithm .",
    "initially , @xmath0 contains a single node @xmath16 , which is a convex subset .",
    "next , one of its neighbors @xmath21 is added , which is again convex . on the next step ,",

    "as anticipated above , convex subsets grow very slowly in sparse technological networks with tree - like structure such as road networks or power grids ( upper part of  table  [ tbl : nets ] ) .",
    "although somewhat counterintuitive , the same slow growth is observed also in coauthorship network that is locally clique - like ( bottom of  table  [ tbl : nets ] ) .",
    "in other networks , convex subsets expand rapidly in early steps of the algorithm whereupon the growth settles after a certain fraction of nodes have been included . in the case of protein networks , this occurs after including @xmath28 of the nodes in _ c.  elegans_network , while over @xmath29 in _ s.  cerevisiae_network , which can be attributed to much higher density of the latter  @xcite ( see  table  [ tbl : nets ] ) . finally , the growth in food web is almost instantaneous , where convex subsets increase by entire trophic levels on each step  @xcite .",
    "expansion of convex subsets is thus very sensitive to a specific topology of a network .",
    "random graph models fail to reproduce convexity in these networks ( circles in  fig .  [",
    "fig : expans ] ) .",
    "convex subsets grow much faster in a random graph and settle only after including ( almost ) all nodes , which is substantially different from what is going on in the networks studied above .",
    "we consider this as an important finding as it shows that convexity is an intrinsic property of networks .",
    "moreover , convexity is explained by network degree distribution only in particular cases with _ c.  elegans_network being the most striking example ( squares in  fig .",
    "[ fig : expans ] ) .    according to our perception of convexity ,",
    "a convex network is such in which every connected subset of nodes is convex .",
    "convexity is therefore associated with extremely slow growth of convex subsets as in technological networks and social collaboration graphs , whereas non - convexity can be identified by instantaneous growth as in food webs . by measuring this growth",
