    "color superconductivity ( cs ) in quark matter @xcite is one interesting aspect of the physics of compact star interiors @xcite .",
    "since calculations of the energy gap of quark pairing predict a value @xmath2 mev and corresponding critical temperatures for the phase transition to the superconducting state are expected to follow the bcs relation @xmath3 , the question arises whether diquark condensation can lead to remarkable effects on the structure and evolution of compact objects .",
    "if positively answered , cs of quark matter could provide signatures for the detection of a deconfined phase in the interior of compact objects ( pulsars , low - mass x - ray binaries ) along the lines of previously suggested strategies @xcite .",
    "diquarks gained popularity in astrophysics about a decade ago , when they were suggested to influence the supernova collapse and `` bounce - off '' @xcite , and to enhance the neutrino cooling of quark - stars .",
    "the latter effect is now subject to much research within improved scenarios refs .",
    "possible consequences for the magnetic field and glitch - type phenomena are discussed in @xcite .",
    "hong , hsu and sannino have conjectured @xcite that the release of binding energy due to cooper pairing of quarks in the course of protoneutron star evolution could provide an explanation for the unknown source of energy in supernovae , hypernovae or gamma - ray bursts , see also @xcite .",
    "their estimate of energy release was based on the simple formula @xmath4 which did not take into account the change in the gravitational binding energy due to the change in the structure of the stars quark core . in the present work we will reinvestigate the question of a possible binding energy release due to a cs transition by taking into account changes in the equation of state ( eos ) and the configuration of the quark star selfconsistently .    as a first step in this direction we will discuss here the two flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) quark matter phase which occurs at lower baryon densities than the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) one , see @xcite .",
    "studies of three - flavor quark models have revealed a very rich phase structure ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , for applications to compact stars the omission of the strange quark flavor within the class of nonlocal chiral quark models considered here may be justified by the fact that central chemical potentials in stable star configurations do barely reach the threshold value at which the mass gap for strange quarks breaks down and they appear in the system @xcite .",
    "therefore we will not discuss here first applications to calculate compact star configurations with color superconducting quark matter phases that have employed non - dynamical quark models @xcite .",
    "their results depend on the somewhat arbitrary choice of the strange quark mass @xmath5 , the diquark gap @xmath6 , and the bag constant .",
    "dynamical calculations like the one we are going to present here fix their model parameters with the constraint to describe observable hadron properties .",
    "they include a selfconsistent solution of the chiral and diquark gap equations which shows that the bulk of a compact star interior does not contain strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "we will investigate the influence of the formfactor of the interaction on the phase diagram and the eos of dense quark matter under the conditions of charge neutrality and isospin asymmetry due to @xmath0-equilibrium relevant for compact stars .",
    "finally we consider the question whether the effect of diquark condensation which occurs in the earlier stages of the compact star evolution ( @xmath7 s ) @xcite at temperatures @xmath8 mev can be considered as an engine for exposive astrophysical phenomena like supernova explosions due to the release of a binding energy of about @xmath9 erg , as has been suggested before @xcite .",

    "after bosonization and integrating out the quark fields , the mean field approximation introduces the following order parameters : the diquark gap @xmath6 , which can be seen as the gain in energy due to diquark condensation , and the mass gaps @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which indicate chiral symmetry breaking .",

    "( [ thp ] ) , we subtract the term @xmath49 in order to define the thermodynamic potential such that the vacuum pressure vanishes , @xmath50 on the mean - field level the present approach is analogous to a flavor- asymmetric generalization of the instanton - motivated model of ref .",

    "the phase transition to the 2sc phase coming from the hot normal state of matter by cooling the system occurs as a second order phase transition without a jump of concentrations , whereas the phase transition from an isospin asymmetric state to a superconducting one by decreasing the asymmetry is of first order and has a jump in the densities ( in particular in the electron fraction ) .",

    "the critcal chemical potential @xmath91 for the chiral transition and for the onset of diquark condensatuion does depend on the type of the formfactor .",
    "the value of the diquark gap reaches @xmath92 mev in the range of densities relevant for compact stars .",
    "it is rather insensitive to changes of the formfactor of the quark interaction .",

    "the figure displays the defect of nonconfining quark models : at nonzero temperature quasifree quarks contribute to the pressure at low chemical potentials @xmath79 ( corresponding to energy densities @xmath103 mev/@xmath104 ) .",
    "the dot - dashed curve in fig . [ fig4 ] shows that the presence of a diquark condensate stabilizes the quark matter system and entails a hardening of the eos .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the matter distribution inside the quark star and the accumulated mass for quark stars with the same central baryon density @xmath105 for different temperatures .",
    "we have cut the density distribution at finite temperatures for @xmath106 due to the following reason . at nonzero temperatures the mass gap decreases as a function of the chemical potential already in the phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "hence the model here gives unphysical low - density excitations of quasi - free quarks .",
    "a systematic improvement of this situation should be obtained by including the phase transition construction to hadronic matter . however , in the present work we circumvent the confinement problem by considering the quark matter phase only for densities @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is nuclear saturation density .",
    "here we compare configurations with and without cs , in order to investigate the effect of diquark condensation on the total energy of a quark star and to decide whether the corresponding phase transition could serve as an engine for explosive phenomena like supernov and gamma ray bursts .",
    "the cs transition can occur during the cooling evolution of a hot protoneutron star @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the approximation of an isothermal temperature distribution @xcite in the star interior is sufficient for the estimate of the mass defect . in the present paper we consider selfbound configurations of pure quark matter as models for quark cores in hybrid stars which should be the general case to be discussed in a separate paper , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath51 configurations .",
    "the extrapolation from pure quark star configurations to hybrid ones , however , is strongly model dependent and can not be done without a calculation .",
    "quark matter effects are expected to be still valid in hybrid stars when rescaled with a monotonously rising function of the ratio of the quark core volume to the quark star volume .",
    "the spherically symmetric , static star configurations are defined by the well known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations @xcite for the mechanical equilibrium of self - gravitating matter ( see also @xcite ) @xmath109[m(r)+4\\pi r^{3}p(r)]}{r[r-2m(r)]}~.\\ ] ]    here @xmath110 is the energy density and @xmath111 the pressure at the distance @xmath112 from the center of the star .",
    "the mass enclosed in a sphere with radius @xmath112 is defined by @xmath113    these equations are solved with the boundary condition of a given central baryon number density @xmath114 defining a configuration . in fig .",
    "[ fig4c ] we show the results for the dependence of the masses on the central energy density as well as on the radius of the configurations for different temperatures and two formfactor models : a gaussian and a lorentzain one .",
    "stable configurations correspond to the rising branch on the mass - central density plane . in tab .",
    "[ mass ] we give for fixed temperatures @xmath115 mev the values of maximal possible mass , corresponding radius , central baryon number density and energy density for a gaussian and a lorentzian formfactor , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we have included @xmath51 configurations for a small coupling constant @xmath116 , for which the diquark condensate does not occur .",
    "the comparison shows that the maximum mass decreases with increasing temperature due to a softening of the eos .",
    "also the disappearance of the diquark condensate ( in our case due to lowering of the coupling @xmath11 ) softens the eos and lowers the maximum mass .",
    "the gaussian formfactor has the lowest critical baryochemical potential when compared with the lorentzian and the njl model .",
    "therefore the gaussian quark star configuration can extend to larger radii where the density is lower and can thus carry more mass than the lorentzian model with the same central baryon density , see fig.[fig4c ] .",
    "since in our calculations we do not consider the existence of a possible hadronic shell of the star where the transition to the phase with broken chiral symmetry and confinement occurs , we introduce a phenomenological cutoff in the baryon number density at the value @xmath117 , see fig [ fig5 ] . with this condition",
    "we define the radius of the quark core @xmath118 .",
    "the total mass @xmath119 of the object is defined by the sphere with that radius @xmath120 .",
    "it is easy to see from that figure that temperature plays no role for the mechanical equilibrium of the quark core close to the center of the configuration due to its high density .",
    "it has an influence , however , on the peripheral region and changes the total mass for a given central density , see figs .",
    "[ fig4c ] .",
    "we have checked numerically , that a change of the somewhat arbitrary cutoff density does not change the qualitative result for the energy release reported below .    for the discussion of evolutionary variations of the internal structure during the cooling it is important to take into account the conservation of the total baryon number of the star .",
    "therefore , one has to compare configurations with different central densities , but with the same baryon number @xmath121 , see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] .    here",
    "we will discuss two scenarios for the protoneutron star cooling which we denote by @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath122 stands for cooling of a star configuration with sc whereas @xmath123 is a scenario without sc .",
    "the initial states for both scenarios are chosen to have the same mass @xmath124 for a given initial temperature of @xmath125 mev .",
    "the final states at @xmath51 , however , have different masses @xmath126 while the total baryon number is conserved in the cooling evolution .",
    "the resulting mass differences are @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 for the gaussian and lorentzian models , respectively .",
    "we make the observation that , contrary to naive expectations of the mass defect as a result of the binding energy from cooper pairing @xcite , @xmath131 erg , the mass defect in the cooling evolution with diquark condensation ( a ) is about @xmath132 smaller than in the scenario without sc ( b ) , regardless of the choice of formfactor .",
    "the difference amounts to @xmath133 for initial configurations with masses of about @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that general relativity effects play an important role in the estimate of the mass defect since the effects of diquark condensation on the mass of configurations via the change in the equation of state overcompensate effects due to the occurence of the diquark gap in the one - particle energies .",
    "we have investigated the influence of diquark condensation on the thermodynamics of quark matter under the conditions of @xmath0-equilibrium and charge neutrality relevant for the discussion of compact stars .",
    "the eos has been derived for a nonlocal chiral quark model in the mean field approximation , and the influence of different formfactors of the nonlocal , separable interaction ( gaussian , lorentzian , njl ) has been studied .",
    "the model parameters are chosen such that the same set of hadronic vacuum observables is described .",
    "we have shown that the critical temperatures and chemical potentials for the onset of the chiral and the superconducting phase transition are the lower the smoother the momentum dependence of the interaction formfactor is .    the phase transition to color superconducting",
    "quark matter from the lower density regions at small temperatures ( @xmath135 mev ) is of first order , while the melting of the diquark condensate and the corresponding transition to normal quark matter at high temperatures is of second order .",
    "the flavor asymmetry in neutral quark matter increases when the electron fraction drops .    when the diquark coupling constant is large enough ( @xmath136 ) then the asymmetry which is present in the system due to the @xmath0-equilibrium condition",
    "does not destroy the diquark condensation .",
    "the electron fraction under these conditions does not exceed @xmath137 .",
    "the masses of the quark core configurations could be up to @xmath138 for the gaussian and up to @xmath139 for the lorentzian formfactor models .",
    "the quark core radii with lorentzian formfactors are up to @xmath140 km , while for gaussian models could extend up to @xmath141 km .",
    "diquark condensation makes the eos harder , which leads to an increase in the maximum mass of the quark star configuration when compared to the case without diquark condensation . for finite temperatures the masses are smaller than at @xmath99 . for asymptotically high temperatures and densities",
    "the eos behaves like a relativistic ideal gas , where the relation pressure versus energy density is temperature independent .",
    "in contrast to the bag model where this behavior occurs immediately after the deconfinement transition , our model eos has a temperature dependent @xmath142 relation also beyond this point .",
    "it has been shown for a hybrid star model which uses the quark matter eos presented in this work that the possibility to obtain a stable star configuration with 2sc quark matter core depends on the formfactor of the quark interaction @xcite .",
    "the gaussian and lorentzian formfactor models do allow a quark matter core , whereas the njl formfactor model does not .",
    "other njl model calculations @xcite confirm this conclusion .",
    "a mass defect of about @xmath143 occurs in the cooling of a hot configuration to a cold one already without diquark condensation .",
    "it is mainly determined by the change of the configuration due to changes in the eos .",
    "cooling the star with diquark condensation results even in a lowering of the mass defect contrary to naive expectations .",
    "for a more realistic calculation of the cooling evolution one has to start from isentropic initial temperature profiles , which may change the size of the mass defect but not our main conclusions .",

    "<S> we calculate the quark star configurations by solving the tolman- oppenheimer- volkoff equations and obtain for the transition from a hot , normal quark matter core of a protoneutron star to a cool diquark condensed one a release of binding energy of the order of @xmath1 erg . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this energy could not serve as an engine for explosive phenomena since the phase transition is not first order . </S>",
