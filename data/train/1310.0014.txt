    "introductory astronomy textbooks usually contain artist impressions of what our galaxy looks like as viewed by an observer located well above its central plane ( e.g. , wikipedia entry for milky way ) .",
    "such images vary from source to source , but normally picture the milky way as a two - armed or four - armed spiral with a prominent central bar inclined by @xmath7 from the line of sight towards the galactic centre .",
    "yet the complete delineation of the galaxy s spiral arms remains a challenge [ 1,2 ] , despite the many years that have elapsed since the early evidence from the distribution of ob - type stars presented by morgan [ 3 ] .",
    "a mapping of rr lyrae variables in the direction of the galactic bulge [ 4 ] displays no evidence of a bar , for example , at the same time generating a very reasonable estimate of @xmath8 kpc for the distance to the galactic centre , @xmath9 .",
    "independent support for that conclusion has recently been provided [ 5 ] , with a similar estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "no hint of a central bar is seen in sergei gaposhkin s fanciful sketches of the milky way from australia [ 6 ] .",
    "arguments for the presence of a bar at the galactic centre mostly postdate the 1964 introduction of the density wave model for spiral structure by lin & shu [ 7 ] , and its existence appears to be generally accepted ( e.g. , [ 8,9,10 ] ) . the question remains whether or not the actual picture is like the four - armed barred spirals depicted by russeil [ 11 ] and valle [ 12 ] .",
    "all arguments about the exact nature of the milky way as a galaxy assume that its gravitational potential is described in standard newtonian fashion , specifically the general relativistic model of einstein .",
    "however , a more recent development linking the physical formulations for electromagnetism and gravitation has been developed [ 13 ] that has interesting consequences if extended to the galaxy .",
    "a cosinusoidal gravitational potential implies a different distribution of mass in the galaxy than is the case for a strictly newtonian potential [ 13,14,15,16,17 ] , and it is of interest to explore potential observational clues that can test the hypothesis .",
    "recent arguments for missing mass and dark matter haloes in galaxies are directly affected by the manner in which mass in the galaxy is linked to its gravitational potential field .",
    "do observations of the various components of the galaxy provide any information pertinent to the question ?",
    "the galaxy s spiral arms have been mapped in two independent ways using objects projected on the galactic plane : ( i ) young stellar objects ( supergiants , long period cepheids , ob stars ) and young open clusters , and ( ii ) density peaks for clouds of neutral ( h i ) and ionized ( h ii ) hydrogen , as well as from the mapping of giant molecular clouds ( sites of star formation ) using co. the former relies on the open cluster and cepheid distance scales , which appear to be in good agreement [ 18 ] , although there is a worrisome dependence on corrections for interstellar extinction at optical wavelengths , which can cause systematic effects . a case in point",
    "is the anomalous reddening towards carina , described by a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath11 [ 19,20 ] , which makes objects in that direction appear more distant than they are .",
    "arguments have also been made for a value of @xmath12 towards the galactic bulge [ 21 ] .",
    "the latter technique relies mainly on inferring distances to hydrogen and molecular clouds from their radial velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , in conjunction with a simple model for galactic rotation .",
    "a source of current problems with our knowledge of galactic rotation is evident from a 1986 review for the international astronomical union ( iau ) [ 22 ] , in which the lsr velocity for the sun is assumed to be the standard solar motion .",
    "the newtonian version of galactic dynamics approximates roseate stellar orbits about the galactic centre by epicycles , in which the epicycle frequency @xmath13 is typically greater than the orbital frequency @xmath14 [ 23,24 ] .",
    "elliptical orbits for which @xmath15 do not match the observed motions of old disk stars , which are best described by @xmath16 .",
    "such an approximation is not restrictive and accommodates a flat rotation curve and the observed velocity ellipsoid for old disk stars .",
    "the latter describes the peculiar motions of stars in the galactic plane , which are most `` ellipsoidal '' for old disk stars . a distinct vertex deviation , a tilt of the velocity ellipsoid from the direction towards the galactic centre , is observed for young stars , and is a matter of active debate .",
    "kinematic solutions tied to proper motion and/or radial velocity measures have been made for the sun s motion relative to various groups of stars [ 23,25,26 ] .",
    "the standard solar motion is defined by the sun s motion relative to the majority of catalogued stars , and amounts to @xmath17 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the basic solar motion is defined by the most frequently occurring velocity components of the sun s motion , and amounts to @xmath18 km s@xmath1 .",
    "although the standard solar motion has for many years been accepted as the motion of the lsr for velocity mapping of the galaxy in h i [ e.g. , 27,28,29 ] , neither it nor the basic solar motion is related to the solar motion relative to the dynamical standard of rest , which is much smaller , in the range @xmath19",
    "km s@xmath1 [ 30,31 ] . although the mayor [ 30 ] and oblak [ 31 ] results are frequently overlooked , there is some support for the smaller velocity from recent results for the sun s motion relative to the interstellar medium [ 32 ] , which amounts to only @xmath20 km s@xmath1 in the direction of galactic orbital motion .    a new solution for the sun s motion relative to the dynamical lsr",
    "was made many years ago by the author , and made use of the standard epicyclic approximation used to describe the drift of any kinematic group relative to the lsr .",
    "that should depend upon the velocity dispersion of the group in the direction towards the galactic centre , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of galactic dynamics [ 23,30 ] predict a drift between the kinematical and dynamical lsr that depends directly upon the square of the velocity dispersion of the group relative to the direction to the galactic centre , namely @xmath22 .",
    "an extrapolation to zero dispersion of the trend in the observed differences relative to the squares of their _ u-_component velocity dispersions should therefore yield the sun s motion relative to the dynamical lsr . such analyses in earlier years always produced a dependence that led to solutions for the _ v-_component of the sun s motion of @xmath23 km s@xmath1 , so that the overall solution for the sun s motion was @xmath17 km s@xmath1 , close to more recent solutions for the standard solar motion [ see 22 ] . that was",
    "the conclusion reached in the kerr & lynden - bell review [ 22 ]",
    ".    a closer look at the data available from [ 25,26 ] and [ 33 ] suggests a different solution , as displayed in fig .",
    "1 . as noted by mayor [ 30 ] and oblak [ 31 ] , young stellar groups with a small _ u-_component dispersion display an offset from the trend displayed by older stellar groups with ages in excess of @xmath24 yr ( 2 galactic orbits ) .",
    "such an offset is predicted by density wave models of the galaxy [ 34 ] , and also explains the increase in the vertex deviation with decreasing age for stellar groups [ 30,31 ] . a solution from fig .",
    "1 that incorporates groups of all ages would indeed generate a solution for @xmath25 of order 15 km s@xmath1 , consistent with the conclusions of kerr & lynden - bell [ 22 ] .",
    "however , a solution for @xmath26 implied by older , well - mixed kinematic groups of galactic stars is @xmath27 km s@xmath1 . a formal solution , i.e. , for @xmath28 using linear fits to the data by combining least squares and non - parametric techniques ( fig .",
    "1 ) , for the solar motion tied to kinematic groups of stars with ages in excess of @xmath29 yr is : @xmath30 giving a solar motion of @xmath31 km s@xmath1 towards galactic coordinates @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the solution is very similar to previous results by mayor [ 30 ] and oblak [ 31 ] , as well as to the lsr solution for neighbouring stars found from hipparcos proper motions [ 35 ] , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "the residual motions for young , recently - created stars ( less than 2 orbits ) exhibit a `` kick '' of @xmath34 km s@xmath1 in the direction opposite galactic rotation , likely associated with the mechanism of their creation , involving an interaction of the parent cloud of gas and dust with a spiral density wave [ 34 ] .",
    "such dynamical effects also help to explain the streaming motions observed along the edges of prominent spiral arms [ e.g. , 34,36 ] .",
    "but earlier maps of galactic spiral structure derived from the radial velocities of hydrogen clouds may be inherently biased because they are tied to invalid corrections for the lsr velocity of the sun .",
    ".motion of sun relative to lsr . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    a compilation of other recent estimates for @xmath9",
    "is given in table 2 .",
    "all are consistent with a distance to the galactic centre close to 8 kpc , although the recent trend is towards values slightly larger .",
    "a weighted mean of all table 2 estimates is @xmath35 kpc , which can probably be adopted as the best estimate presently available .",
    "it is very similar to the value of 8.2 kpc advocated by many astronomers in recent years .",
    "the point to be made , however , is that radial velocity mapping of galactic h i , h ii , and co clouds is certain to generate biased results for galactic spiral structure for two reasons .",
    "first , the constants for galactic rotation adopted by the iau in 1985 [ see 22 ] are incorrect , being too small for @xmath36 ( 220 km s@xmath1 vs.  251 km s@xmath1 ) , too large for the solar motion relative to the lsr ( 20 km s@xmath1 vs.  14 km s@xmath1 ) , and slightly large for @xmath9 ( 8.5 kpc vs.  8.24 kpc ) .",
    "second , the implied offset or `` kick '' from standard galactic rotation expected [ 34 ] and observed for young objects associated with a spiral density wave implies that a simple model for galactic rotation is insufficient for correlating velocity with distance for the galaxy s gas clouds .",
    "the main basis for spiral arm mapping is therefore through distances to young objects observed optically , where other systematic effects can be important .",
    "the difference between the galaxy s gravitational potential for standard newtonian dynamics and a cosinusoidal potential is significant enough to produce observable effects .",
    "star clusters appear to be one means of testing such differences .",
    "a good case in point is the cluster bica 6 , at @xmath37 , which has an observed radial velocity of @xmath38 km s@xmath1 [ 52 ] , @xmath39 km s@xmath1 larger than expected for galactic rotation with a flat rotation curve ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for a newtonian galactic gravitational potential that implies an orbital velocity for the cluster and its associated planetary nebula of @xmath40 km s@xmath1 , very close to escape velocity .",
    "it is then a mystery how the cluster obtained such a large boost in its orbital speed relative to other open clusters in this direction . in a cosinusoidal potential , however , it is possible to consider the cluster s radial velocity as mainly the result of an excess velocity of @xmath41 km s@xmath1 in a direction away from the galactic centre , a bit large , perhaps , but not inordinately so , for the cluster s oscillatory motion away from the 400 pc turning points [ 14,53 ] . in this scheme ,",
    "bica 6 lies less than 0.15 kpc beyond such a turning point .",
    "a galactic cosinusoidal potential produces much stronger tidal effects than does a newtonian potential [ 54 ] .",
    "such effects are particularly relevant to clusters lying above or below the galactic plane by less than 400 pc .",
    "an interesting example is the cluster collinder 464 , shown in fig .",
    "4 . collinder 464 is little studied , mainly because of a high declination and the fact that collinder made a small typo in his coordinates for the cluster [ 55 ] .",
    "it is actually a degree further north than the value originally published by him .",
    "the cluster is little reddened , if at all ( @xmath42 ) , and only @xmath43 pc distant .",
    "its location places it just above the galactic plane , but what is most striking is the elongation towards the galactic plane displayed by its member stars , which comprise nearly all of the objects lying within the ellipse plotted in fig .",
    "strongly tidally distorted star clusters are rare in the galaxy , but collinder 464 appears to be a good case .        for many years , astronomers have used a newtonian version of the virial theorem suitable for galactic objects to estimate masses for star clusters .",
    "the relevant formula is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the velocity dispersion of the group in km s@xmath1 and @xmath46 is the average radius of the group in parsecs ( pc ) .",
    "the milky way subgroup of the local group used in fig .",
    "2 has a velocity dispersion of @xmath47 km s@xmath1 and an average radial extent of 123,000 pc , yielding @xmath48 , a reasonable result for a group containing the milky way and and all of the other galaxies in the milky way subgroup of the local group .",
    "the m31 subgroup is more difficult to analyze .",
    "the group appears to have a velocity dispersion of @xmath49 km s@xmath1 and an average radius of 50,000 pc , yielding @xmath50 , implying an overall larger mass for the galaxies in the m31 subgroup .",
    "such a result seems reasonable .",
    "the difference between a newtonian gravitational potential and a cosinusoidal potential is the cosine term with its putative universal `` wavelength '' of 400 pc [ 53 ] .",
    "since the average radius of most star clusters of @xmath20 pc is much smaller than 400 pc , the formula cited above should be unchanged in a cosinusoidal potential field .",
    "likewise , the typical radius of @xmath51 pc for a small cluster of galaxies estimated above is much larger than 400 pc , so the formula should be equally suitable on galaxy cluster scales .",
    "the masses estimated here for the milky way and m31 subgroups of the local group , taken in isolation , are therefore unable to discriminate between cosinusoidal and newtonian gravitational potential relations .",
