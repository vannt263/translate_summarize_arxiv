    "in this paper , we study site percolation on the triangular planar lattice . recall that this can be viewed as a random coloring of the hexagonal cells of a honeycomb lattice , where the color ( black or white ) of each cell is chosen independently of the others : each of these cells has a probability @xmath6 to be black and @xmath7 to be white , for some parameter @xmath6 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in percolation theory ,",
    "one is interested in the connectivity properties of the set of black hexagons ( or the set of white ones ) .",
    "they can be regrouped into connected components ( or clusters ) .",
    "the phase transition for percolation on this lattice occurs at @xmath10 .",
    "often , it is described mathematically as follows , in terms of almost sure properties of percolation in the infinite lattice : when @xmath11 , there exists with probability @xmath9 no infinite cluster of black sites ( subcritical regime ) and an infinite cluster of white sites , and conversely when @xmath12 , there is an infinite cluster of black sites ( supercritical regime ) but no infinite cluster of white sites . in the critical case where @xmath10 , there exists neither an infinite white cluster , nor an infinite black cluster ",
    "but if one takes a finite large piece @xmath13 of the lattice , one will see white and black clusters of size comparable to that of @xmath13 .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for an introduction to percolation .",
    "a lot of progress has been made recently in the understanding of the large - scale behavior of critical percolation : in particular , smirnov @xcite proved conformal invariance of the connection probabilities , which allowed to make the link @xcite with the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) with parameter 6 introduced in @xcite , and to use the sle technology and computations @xcite to derive further properties of critical percolation , such as the value of some critical exponents , describing the asymptotic behavior of the probabilities of certain exceptional events ( arm exponents ) @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey .",
    "one precise relation to sle goes as follows : we consider the large equilateral triangle @xmath14 with even side length @xmath1 on the triangular grid such that the middle of the bottom part is the origin and the top point is the point at distance @xmath15 above the origin .",
    "we decide to color all cells on the boundary of the triangle , in white if their @xmath16-coordinate is positive and in black if their @xmath16-coordinate is negative , and we perform critical percolation in the inside of @xmath14 .",
    "then , we consider the interface @xmath17 ( viewed as a path on the hexagonal lattice dual to the triangular lattice ) between the set of black sites attached to the left part of the triangle and the set of white sites connected to the right part of the triangle ( see figure [ triangle ] ) . when @xmath18 , the law of the rescaled interface @xmath19 converges ( in an appropriate topology ) to that of the sle(6 ) process from @xmath20 to @xmath21 in the equilateral triangle with unit side length .",
    "see @xcite for details , and e.g. @xcite for an introduction to sle .",
    "thanks to this convergence result , one is able to deduce properties of critical percolation from the properties of sle . for instance ( and we shall come back to this later ) , one can prove that the typical number of steps of the path @xmath17 is of the order @xmath22 ( more precisely , for each @xmath23 , the probability that the number of steps is between @xmath24 and @xmath25 goes to @xmath9 as @xmath18 ) .     and the interface @xmath17 ( sketch).,width=340 ]    understanding the behavior of critical percolation allows also to derive some properties of percolation when the parameter @xmath6 is very close to @xmath26 .",
    "these are the scaling ( and hyperscaling ) relations that were first developed in the physics literature ( the names of fischer , kadanoff and wilson are often associated to these ideas ) , and later rigorously derived in the case of percolation by kesten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . before explaining these relations in a little more detail ,",
    "let us first make a trivial observation to help the newcomer to get a feeling of what goes on .",
    "suppose that we consider the percolation interface in the large equilateral triangle as before , but choose @xmath27 in such a way that @xmath28 .",
    "then , one can couple it with a critical percolation interface ( i.e. with the case when @xmath10 exactly ) in the same triangle in such a way that the two paths are identical except on an event of probability that goes to @xmath8 as @xmath29 ( this is just because the probability that one of the neighbors of the interface changed its color is bounded by @xmath30 times the number of neighbors of the interface  and we have just seen that this number is @xmath31 ) . hence ,",
    "if one lets @xmath1 go to infinity , the scaling limit of the interface is still sle(6 ) . in particular , the probability",
    "that the interface @xmath32 hits the right side of the triangle before the left side of the triangle  let us call @xmath33 this probability  goes to @xmath26 as @xmath18 .    on the other hand , for any fixed @xmath34",
    ", one can define @xmath35 for this choice of @xmath36 , if one looks at the possible limiting behavior of @xmath32 , it is clear that the law can not be exactly sle(6 ) anymore because it will hit the right side of the triangle before the left one with probability at least @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask what can happen to the scaling limit of this curve when @xmath18 in this regime , and to see how it is related ( or not ) to sle(6 ) .",
    "one can equivalently define the so - called correlation length @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( note that for @xmath42 fixed , @xmath43 as @xmath18 ) .",
    "kesten @xcite has shown that it is possible to deduce from the arm exponents of critical percolation the behavior of @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "this derivation relies on the `` four - arm exponent '' : the crossing probability increases exactly when `` pivotal '' sites are flipped . combining kesten s results with the exponents computed using sle",
    ", one gets @xcite that @xmath46 when @xmath47 , for any fixed choice of @xmath34 .",
    "this is ( see @xcite ) a crucial step in the rigorous proof of the fact that the `` density '' @xmath48 of the infinite cluster for percolation with parameter @xmath6 decays like @xmath49 as @xmath6 decays to @xmath50 .",
    "we shall see ( and this is quite easy ) that in order to get a non - trivial limit for @xmath32 ( i.e. neither sle(6 ) nor a path that just sticks to the boundary of @xmath51 ) , one has to take @xmath52 in such a way that @xmath1 is of the order of the correlation length @xmath44 i.e. that @xmath53 $ ] for some @xmath54 . the terminology to describe this regime depends on the circumstances and the papers : near - critical , off - critical , finite - size scaling .",
    "it is also very closely related to the scaling and hyperscaling relations .",
    "anyway , it has been the subject of numerous and interesting works , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one general rule behind the derivation of these results is that as long as @xmath55 , the behavior remains roughly the same as at criticality .",
    "we will remind some related results in the next sections , but for example , the probabilities of existence of crossings of annuli for near - critical percolation are bounded by constant times those at criticality .",
    "this implies that the exponents describing critical percolation also describe off - critical percolation and lead to kesten s scaling relations . in @xcite , camia ,",
    "fontes and newman have suggested that the scaling limit of the near - critical picture could be obtained from that of the critical picture by just opening a poissonian family of `` pivotal '' points .",
    "we understand that @xcite have succeeded in proving this fact .",
    "a consequence would be that the subsequential limits that we are discussing in the present paper are in fact limits , and that they are all related to each other by scaling .",
    "let us also mention that near - critical percolation is closely related to the questions concerning the noise - sensitivity of percolation , such as studied in @xcite .    before describing the results of the present paper ,",
    "let us just emphasize the relevance of such near - critical models for physical applications .",
    "suppose for instance that one is considering a percolation model in a large box , and that one `` heats '' progressively the system i.e. that cells become progressively black one after the other ( and independently ) .",
    "then , we know that the percolation parameter at which a left - to - right crossing of the big box will appear is ( with a large probability ) close to the critical one .",
    "but , if one looks at it more precisely , it is easy to see that the value at which the crossing occurs will be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a uniform random variable in @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "hence , at this moment , the picture and its fine properties are that of near - critical percolation .",
    "another example where this near - critical picture appears spontaneously is that of gradient percolation , an inhomogeneous percolation model introduced in @xcite and studied mathematically in @xcite",
    ".        our focus here will be on the scaling limits of near - critical interfaces .",
    "here is a list of results that we shall derive in the present paper . choose a sequence @xmath59 and study the behavior of the law of @xmath32 as @xmath18 :    * for any @xmath34 , if we choose @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath0 is close to @xmath60 , then there exist subsequential limits for the law of @xmath32 . * the limiting laws are all singular with respect to the law of sle(6 ) . * the only other possible scaling limits are sle(6 ) itself ( when @xmath0 is too close to @xmath2 ) or a degenerate case where @xmath61 follows ( the right part of ) the boundary of the triangle ( this is when @xmath0 is too large ) . * the critical exponents associated to these non - degenerate scaling limits are the same as those of sle(6 ) .",
    "in particular , the hausdorff dimension of the curves is almost surely @xmath5 .     and",
    "at @xmath62 of figure [ nicepic ] depicted separately.,width=384 ]    the first result is a rather direct application of the tightness arguments of aizenman and burchard @xcite and the definition of the correlation length .",
    "the last two statements follow from the ideas of kesten s paper @xcite .",
    "our main result is probably the second one , the fact that the laws of non - trivial scaling limits are singular with respect to sle(6 ) .",
    "one way to explain it is the following . in the off - critical regime , one sees on a macroscopic scale a difference between the law of the interface and that of the critical percolation interface ( i.e. the non - critical interface is more to the `` right '' for instance ) .",
    "if one zooms in by a factor @xmath63 , one still sees a difference , but this difference tends to disappear , because one is not looking at a picture of size ca . @xmath44 any more , but at a picture of size @xmath64 .",
    "the question is whether this difference disappears sufficiently fast when @xmath65 or not .",
    "note that one can show that ( just as for the critical interface ) the number of boxes of size @xmath66 visited by the path is of order @xmath67 when @xmath63 is large ( and @xmath1 very large ) .",
    "either this difference vanishes fast with @xmath63 and one is not able to almost surely detect a difference between the two macroscopic interfaces , or the difference between these two behaviors can be detected by averaging them out over the @xmath67 parts of the path . in the end",
    ", one has to compare certain critical exponents to decide which scenario is correct and it turns out that it is the second one .",
    "a `` flavor '' of supercritical percolation is therefore still present in the scaling limit .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we do not really use any complex analytic sle technology to derive our results .",
    "our considerations are based on percolation techniques , kesten s scaling ideas and the knowledge of the exact value of the critical exponents ( the derivation of which however used sle ) .",
    "this paper will build on earlier results on near - critical percolation , and in particular on kesten s paper @xcite . in this section",
    ", we recall some results that we shall use .",
    "all these results are stated and derived in @xcite .",
    "see also the last section of @xcite for a rough survey . throughout the paper , we will use the notation @xmath68 to say that the ratio between two quantities remains bounded away from @xmath8 and @xmath69 .    recall our definition of the correlation length @xmath70 note that @xmath71 is non - increasing with respect to @xmath6 and non - decreasing with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "we define the event @xmath73 that there exist four paths of alternating colors ( when ordered clockwise around the origin ) , each of them joining a neighbor of the origin to the circle of radius @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , we define the event @xmath75 ( resp .",
    "@xmath76 ) that there exist two paths of different colors ( resp .",
    "one black path ) from a neighbor of the origin to the circle of radius @xmath74 .",
    "we will use the following properties , that hold for any fixed @xmath34 :    1 .",
    "the russo - seymour - welsh estimates remain valid below @xmath77 : for all @xmath78 , there exists @xmath79 such that for all @xmath6 , for all @xmath80 , the probability ( for @xmath81 ) that there is a black ( resp .",
    "white ) horizontal crossing of a @xmath82 parallelogram is at least @xmath83 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath84 denote the event that there exist two arms of different colors joining the circles of radii @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then ( this follows from the `` arm - separation lemmas '' ) , @xmath87 uniformly for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( this is known as the _ quasi - multiplicativity _ property ) .",

    "shows that @xmath103 uniformly for @xmath94 , @xmath104 ( and similarly for @xmath90 ) .",

    "analogous statements hold for any number of arms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the correlation length introduced here differs slightly from the usual one  let us denote it here by @xmath112  that is defined in terms of crossing probabilities of rectangles or rhombi ( the one introduced in @xcite , and used for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "using russo - seymour - welsh considerations ( and also the fact that for any @xmath100 , @xmath113  see @xcite ) , these two definitions can easily be shown to be equivalent : for any @xmath99 , @xmath114 .",
    "we are thus allowed to use for @xmath71 results established for @xmath115 .",
    "alternatively , we could have chosen to work with rhombi instead of triangles and then , we would have used directly the usual definition of correlation length .",
    "these two definitions are also known to be equivalent to other `` natural '' correlation lengths , describing for example the mean radius of a finite cluster or the rate of decay of connectivity properties ( see e.g. the discussion in section 2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity of presentation , we will stick to the setup that we described in the introduction , even if the shape of the considered domain ( in our case , it is the triangle ) could be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "let us describe this setup more precisely .",
    "we follow here the definitions of @xcite , and refer the reader to this paper for more details .",
    "we consider @xmath51 the ( filled ) equilateral triangle of unit side length , with corners @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath21 .",
    "the rescaled interfaces will be elements of @xmath118 , the space of curves in @xmath51 : these are equivalence classes of continuous functions from @xmath119 $ ] to @xmath51 , where two functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 represent the same curve if and only if there exists a continuous increasing bijection @xmath122 \\to [ 0 , 1]$ ] such that @xmath123 .",

    "we call @xmath127 the law of the rescaled interface @xmath128 of percolation with parameter @xmath6 in our triangle ( with mesh size @xmath129 ) : this is a probability measure on @xmath118 .",
    "endowed with the previous metric , @xmath118 is a complete separable space , so that tightness and relative compactness are equivalent ( by prohorov s theorem ) .",

    "* let us consider a sequence @xmath132 in this family .",
    "our goal is to find a converging subsequence :    * by symmetry , we can assume that @xmath133 for all @xmath134 .",
    "* if @xmath135 remains bounded along a subsequence , proving convergence of a subsequence of @xmath136 is trivial .",
    "* we can therefore restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath137 .",
    "suppose that for all @xmath34 , @xmath138 along a subsequence ; then it is easy to check ( using russo - seymour - welsh arguments ) that along that subsequence , @xmath139 converges in law to the concatenation of the two parametrized segments @xmath140 \\cup [ 1 / 2 ,    \\sqrt{3 } i / 2]$ ] . *",
    "we now suppose that for some @xmath141 , @xmath142 remains bounded . in particular , we get that for some fixed @xmath143 , @xmath144 for all large enough @xmath145 ( indeed , by russo - seymour - welsh , one can increase @xmath71 by at least any constant factor by choosing a larger @xmath146 ) .",
    "we can then use the machinery developed by aizenman and burchard ( theorem 1.2 in @xcite ) : russo - seymour - welsh estimates hold uniformly for all @xmath6 and @xmath147 , so that for any annulus @xmath148 , @xmath149 for two universal constants @xmath150 ( traversed means here that it visits the inner and the outer boundary of the annulus ) .",
    "the bk inequality ( see e.g. @xcite ) then leads to the fact that @xmath151 which is exactly the hypothesis ( h1 ) of @xcite ( uniform power bounds on the probability of multiple crossings in annuli ) . + for the sake of completeness , let us just sketch why tightness can be derived from this .",
    "first , the hypothesis ( h1 ) implies regularity properties ( theorem 1.1 in @xcite ) for the random curves @xmath152 : for any @xmath153 , there is some hlder continuity bound such that for each @xmath145 , there is a probability at least @xmath154 that @xmath152 can be parametrized and satisfy this bound .",
    "in particular , we can exhibit some equicontinuous set such that for each @xmath145 , @xmath152 belongs to this set with probability at least @xmath154 .",
    "tightness follows ( theorem 1.2 in @xcite ) using ( a slight adaptation of ) arzela - ascoli s characterization of compactness for continuous functions on a compact set .",
    "hence , in all cases , one can find a converging subsequence of @xmath155 .",

    "in fact , for each fixed triangle , the probability that its status for @xmath61 is not identical to its status for @xmath219 goes to zero as @xmath206 .",
    "indeed , if we suppose for instance that @xmath298 is good for @xmath61 but not for @xmath219 , then it means that a three - arm event occurs for @xmath61 and a priori bounds do exclude this .",

    "so , the domains @xmath328 ( with obvious notation ) converge in carathodory topology towards @xmath310 almost surely .",
    "we now couple each realization of @xmath219 with a realization @xmath329 of critical percolation on the same lattice , in such a way that the realization used to define @xmath219 dominates @xmath329 ( _ i.e. _ its set of black sites is larger ) .",
    "then ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it follows that the probability @xmath330 that there exists a crossing from @xmath331 to @xmath332 in @xmath328 for @xmath329 ( with natural notation ) converges almost surely to @xmath318 .",
    "suppose now that the triangle @xmath298 is good for @xmath219 and consider the configurations as depicted on figure [ pivotal ] : we restrict ourselves to the case where there exist sites in a smaller rhombus of size comparable to @xmath333 from which four arms of alternating colors originate .",
    "for each such site @xmath16 , and conditionally on @xmath326 $ ] , the probability that this four - arm configuration exists for percolation of parameter @xmath334 $ ] in the domain not yet explored by @xmath219 is bounded from below by a constant @xmath239 times @xmath335 , uniformly over @xmath6 , @xmath145 and the choice of @xmath6 ( this follows from the uniform estimates for four arms , the separation lemmas and russo - seymour - welsh ) .",
    "the probability that this site is flipped from white to black when one increases @xmath6 from @xmath2 to @xmath247 , and that at this value @xmath6 the configuration is as described above , is therefore larger than @xmath336 finally , note that this event can happen for only one site ( when @xmath6 increases , since the crossing event is increasing , there can exist only one value of @xmath6 and therefore one site @xmath16 such that the state of @xmath16 is flipped exactly at @xmath6 and @xmath16 at that moment is pivotal ) .",
    "hence , we can sum over all sites @xmath16 in the small rhombus , and deduce that the conditional probability given @xmath337 $ ] that @xmath298 is very good is bounded from below by @xmath338 ( we have used the quasi - multiplicativity to estimate the ratio on the second line ) for all small @xmath198 and uniformly with respect to @xmath145 and to the good configurations @xmath326 $ ] . letting @xmath206 , we conclude that for any good triangle @xmath298 , the conditional probability given @xmath339 $ ] that @xmath298 is very good for @xmath61 is at least @xmath340    we now want to estimate the number of good triangles @xmath298 .",
    "we divide the triangle @xmath51 into @xmath341 small deterministic triangles . using the same method as when studying the dimension of @xmath61 ( and the arm - separation ideas that allow to estimate the probability that a triangle is good i.e. to say that the probability for a triangle @xmath298 to be good is comparable to the probability to be hit ) , we see that with probability going to @xmath9 as @xmath342 , the number of good triangles is at least @xmath343 .",
    "we now count how many triangles are very good among the first @xmath344 good ones , and we subtract the sum of the @xmath345 for these good triangles . if @xmath61 was an sle(6 ) , the obtained quantity @xmath346 would satisfy @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "but , in our case , we see that @xmath349 and @xmath350 .",
    "if the sequence @xmath351 has been chosen to converge sufficiently fast to zero , we see that almost surely ( using borel - cantelli ) , for all sufficiently large @xmath176 , @xmath352 whereas if @xmath61 had been an sle(6 ) , we would almost surely have had @xmath353 for infinitely many @xmath176 s .",
    "we thus found an event that holds with probability one for @xmath61 , but with probability zero for sle(6 ) .",
    "seemingly , the fact that the laws of near - critical interfaces are singular with respect to the law of sle(6 ) surprises some theoretical physicists who work on this topic .",
    "recall that one important aspect of the sle approach to critical systems was precisely to show that critical conformally invariant models in the same `` universality class '' give rise to exactly the same curves in the scaling limit . for near - critical models that are not strictly conformally invariant such as near - critical percolation here",
    ", this strong `` universality '' can fail to be true .",
    "suppose that a random curve @xmath61 is the scaling limit of a near - critical percolation interface .",
    "the tightness arguments , together with the estimates for existence of multiple arms indicate that the curve @xmath61 is almost surely a loewner chain , and that it can be defined via its random driving function @xmath354 .",
    "it is of course a natural question to ask what this driving function could be ( recall that in the case of sle(6 ) , @xmath355 is a standard brownian motion ) .",
    "note that after each ( fixed or stopping ) time , we expect the curve @xmath61 to turn `` more right '' as what a sle(6 ) would do in the same situation .",
    "this leads naturally to the conjecture that ( if one extends properly the probability space ) one can couple @xmath354 with a standard brownian motion @xmath356 in such a way that @xmath357 is an increasing continuous process adapted to the filtration generated by the processes @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "one may think that this contradicts the fact that the law of @xmath360 is singular with respect to that of @xmath292 ( since the curves are generated by the driving functions , this is equivalent to say that the law of @xmath61 is singular with respect to that of sle(6 ) ) because the law of brownian motion with drift is known to be absolutely continuous with respect to that of brownian motion .",
    "but this last fact is only valid under some regularity properties for the drift , and in the present case , one can expect this drift to be quite complicated ( its derivative measure might be supported on a set of exceptional times i.e. a fractal - type set ) .",
    "we have seen that important properties ( such as the dimension of the curve ) are shared by the critical interfaces and the near - critical interfaces in the scaling limit , so that the technology based on conformal invariance of the critical model still provides the correct description of the near - critical interfaces in terms of exponents ( this was used in @xcite to describe the `` percolation front '' ) .",
    "in fact , the near - critical percolation technology allows to prove the following result ( this is a direct consequence of the quasi - multiplicativity property and the fact that arm probabilities are comparable uniformly to the arm probabilities at @xmath4 ) : for any @xmath145 , there exists a constant @xmath361 , such that for any @xmath362 in @xmath51 , and for any sufficiently small @xmath72 , the ratio between the probability that @xmath61 visits the @xmath72-neighborhood of these @xmath145 points and the probability of the same event for sle(6 ) stays in @xmath363 for all small @xmath72 and uniformly over the choices of @xmath364 . loosely speaking ,",
    "the `` finite - dimensional marginals '' of the law of @xmath61 are uniformly comparable to those of sle(6 ) ( even when the @xmath365 s are very close to each other ) .",
    "note that this is the type of functions that is computable via the conformal field theory technology .",
    "but this result does not contradict the fact that the law of @xmath61 is singular with respect to that of sle(6 ) .",
    "note for instance that the constant @xmath361 does depend on the number of considered points .",
    "our proof used the fact that we did not zoom on the behavior of the curve at just one point , but that we detected the asymmetry by looking at the mean of the behavior of the curve near to more and more points .",
