    "<S> we point out that although there is an established literature as far as the mean heat current is concerned , there are few results available about its statistics @xcite .    at the same time , a variety of real structures such as biological systems @xcite and artificial networks in thin - film transistors and nano - sensors @xcite do not fall into the categories of standard one- or two - dimensional lattice geometries . </S>",

    "<S> we find that in the large @xmath28 limit the transmittance , as a function of frequency of the incident wave , exhibits stop bands ( total reflection ) and pass bands ( only partial reflection ) . </S>",
