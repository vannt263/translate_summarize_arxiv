    "blue straggler stars ( bsss ) are commonly defined as stars brighter and bluer than the main - sequence ( ms ) turnoff in the host stellar cluster .",
    "they are thought to be central h - burning stars , more massive than the ms turnoff stars ( shara et al .",
    "1997 ; gilliland et al .",
    "1998 ; de marco et al . 2004 ; fiorentino et al . 2014 ) . in stellar systems with no evidence of recent star formation",
    ", their origin can not be explained in the framework of normal single - star evolution and two main formation channels are currently favored : ( 1 ) mass transfer ( mt ) in binary systems , possibly up to the complete coalescence of the two stars , and ( 2 ) stellar collisions .",
    "both these processes can potentially bring new hydrogen into the core and therefore `` rejuvenate '' a star to its ms stage ( e.g. , lombardi et al .",
    "1995 , 2002 ; chen & han 2009 ) .",
    "the scenario of physical collision was originally presented by hills & day ( 1976 ) , and then different colliding encounters including single - single ( benz & hills 1987 ) , single - binary , and binary - binary processes ( leonard 1989 ; ouelette & pritchet 1998 ) have been investigated in subsequent work .",
    "collisions are believed to be important especially in dense environments , such as the cores of globular clusters ( gcs ; bailyn 1992 ; ferraro et al 1995 , 1997 , 2003a , b ) and even the center of some open clusters ( leonard & linnell 1992 ; glebbeek et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "mccrea ( 1964 ) first proposed that bsss can be formed through mt in close binaries .",
    "the process starts when the primary fills up its roche lobe and then transfers material to the secondary through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "the secondary increases its mass and shows up as a bss when its luminosity exceeds that of the ms turnoff stars .",
    "there are three cases of mt , defined according to the evolutionary stage of the primary when it starts to transfer mass to the secondary ( kippenhahn & weigert 1968 ) : case - a when the primary is on the ms , case - b when it is in post - ms but before helium ignition , and case - c during central he - burning and thereafter .",
    "tian et al . ( 2006 ) reveal that the bsss in m67 can be effectively generated in short - period binaries via case - a and case - b mt .",
    "( 2011 ) pay close attention to bss populations in the intermediate - age star clusters , where they find that both case - a and case - b mt can produce bsss , and bsss via case - b are generally bluer and even brighter than those from case - a .",
    "mt in binaries might be the dominant formation channels in all environments ( e.g. , knigge et al .",
    "2009 ; leigh et al .",
    "2013 ) , and most likely it is so in low - density gcs , open clusters and the galactic field ( ferraro et al .",
    "2006a ; sollima et al .",
    "2008 ; mathieu et al . 2009",
    "; preston & sneden 2000 ) . in the case of case - b or case - c binary origin",
    ", a bss with a white dwarf companion is expected .",
    "this has been recently confirmed for three objects in the open cluster ngc 188 , thanks to hst ultraviolet observations ( gosnell et al .",
    "mt can also produce anomalous surface composition on the accretor s surface .",
    "indeed c and o depletion has been observed in the atmosphere of a sub - sample of bsss in the gcs 47 tucanae , m30 and @xmath3 centauri ( ferraro et al .",
    "2006b ; lovisi et al .",
    "2013 ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "2014 ) , thus likely indicating the mt origin of these stars .",
    "because of their large number of member stars , gcs are the ideal environment for bss studies .",
    "nominally all the gcs observed so far have been found to harbor a significant number of bsss ( piotto et al .",
    "2004 ; leigh et al .",
    "moreover , the stellar density in gcs varies dramatically from the central regions to the outskirts , and since bsss in different environments ( low- versus high - density ) could have different origins ( e.g. , fusi pecci et al . 1992 ; davies et al .",
    "2004 ) , these stellar systems allow to investigate both formation channels simultaneously .",
    "however a clear distinction is hampered by the internal dynamical evolution of the parent cluster ( ferraro et al .",
    "in fact , having masses larger than normal cluster stars , bsss are affected by dynamical friction , a process that drives the objects more massive than the average toward the cluster center , over a timescale which primarily depends on the local mass density ( e.g. , alessandrini et al . 2014 ) . hence ,",
    "as the time goes on , heavy objects ( like bsss ) orbiting at larger and larger distances from the cluster center are expected to drift toward the core : as a consequence , the radial distribution of bsss develops a central peak and a dip , and the region devoid of these stars progressively propagates outward .",
    "ferraro et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used this argument to define the so - called `` dynamical clock '' , an empirical tool able to measure the dynamical age of a stellar system from the shape of its bss radial distribution .",
    "this appears indeed to provide a coherent interpretation of the variety of bss radial distributions observed so far : gcs with a flat bss radial distribution ( ferraro et al .",
    "2006b ; dalessandro et al . 2008a",
    "; beccari et al . 2011 ) are dynamically young systems , gcs with bimodal distributions ( e.g. , ferraro et al . 1993 , 2004 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007a ; dalessandro et al .",
    "2008b ; beccari",
    "2013 , and references therein ) are dynamically intermediate - age systems ( their actual dynamical age being determined by the distance of the dip of the distribution from the cluster center ) , and gcs with a single - peaked bss distribution ( ferraro et al . 1999a ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007b ; contreras  ramos et al .",
    "2012 ; dalessandro et al .",
    "2013 ) are dynamically old systems .",
    "following this view , in the cluster center we expect a mixed bss population : collisional bsss produced by stellar interactions and mt bsss drifted to the center because of dynamical friction .",
    "a recent discovery has potentially opened the possibility to photometrically distinguish collisional bsss from mt bsss in the same cluster .",
    "two well distinct bss sequences , almost parallel and similarly populated , have been found in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m30 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter f09 ) .",
    "similar features have been detected also in ngc  362 by dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and ngc  1261 by simunovic et al .",
    "the blue - bss sequence observed in m30 is nicely reproduced by collisional isochrones ( sills et al .",
    "2009 ) with ages of 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "in contrast , the red - bss population is far too red to be consistent with collisional isochrones of any age , while it seems to well correspond to the `` low - luminosity boundary '' outlined by the mt binary populations simulated by tian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the open cluster m67 ( with an age of 4 gyr ) , once `` extrapolated '' to the case of a much older ( @xmath4 gyr ) cluster as m30 .",
    "however , given the large difference in age between these two systems ( which implies significantly different mass regimes for their current binary systems and bsss ) , such an extrapolation can be risky and it was made only because no specific models of mt binaries were available at that time for the case of m30 .    with the aim of finally providing a firm conclusion about the true nature of the red - bss sequence observed in m30 , here we present mt binary models specifically calculated for this cluster .",
    "we also used monte - carlo simulations to study the distribution of synthetic mt - bsss in the cmd .",
    "the details of the binary evolution models are described in sect .",
    "the results of the monte - carlo simulations are presented and compared with the observations in sect .",
    "4 gives summary and discussion .",
    "we use the stellar evolution code originally written by eggleton ( 1971 , 1972 , 1973 ) and then updated several times ( e.g. , han et al . 1994 ; pols et al . 1995 , 1998 ) to calculate the evolution of primordial binaries .",
    "the detailed description of the version we used can be found in han et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and lu et al .",
    "in particular , for this work we adopted the radiative opacity of iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) and the molecular opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) , and conservations in both mass and angular momentum are assumed .",
    "roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is used as a boundary condition in the code . when rlof takes place , the mass transfer rate ( @xmath5 ) between the two components is described as : @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the radius of the donor ( primary star ) , and @xmath8 is the effective radius of the corresponding roche lobe .",
    "we use @xmath9 yr@xmath10 to keep the rlof steady .",
    "the donor may overfill its roche lobe , but the condition of @xmath11 must be satisfied ( han et al . 2000 ) . in order to avoid numerical instabilities , the calculation stops if the rlof is unstable .",
    "we assume the initial orbital eccentricity to be zero ( @xmath12 ) for all the models .",
    "convective overshooting is not considered as it can barely influence the evolution of low - mass stars ( pols et al .",
    "after all the fundamental ingredients are prepared , instead of simply approximating the major parameters at each time step by interpolating between corresponding evolutionary tracks , we performed the calculation in a more precise way , exactly following the evolution of both components .",
    "eggleton s code provides details for both components of a binary , but it loses the information of the secondary during the rlof .",
    "we made minor modifications to the code , so that the mass - loss history of the donor is recorded , and it is used to compute the subsequent evolution of the accretor . such a treatment keeps the evolution of both components synchronized .",
    "the accreted material from the donor is assumed to be deposited onto the surface of the accretor and instantly distributed homogeneously over its outer layer .    in this work",
    "we initially considered both case - a and case - b mt .",
    "however we found that most of the case - a mt binaries did not survive until the current cluster age .",
    "moreover , the mt was often unstable , thus making the code stop and preventing us to follow the complete evolutionary paths of these systems .",
    "hence , in the following we focus only on case - b mt ( and binary mergers ) . in any case , bsss generated by case - a mt have been found to lie on the red side of the case - b locus ( lu et al .",
    "2011 ) , and they are therefore expected to not affect the main result of this work . given the age and the metallicity of m30 ( @xmath1313  gyr and z=0.0001 ) , its current turnoff mass is @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the currently observable bsss generated from case - b mt in primordial binaries should come from donor stars with initial masses roughly between 0.7 and 1.1  @xmath15 .",
    "we can trace case - b mt only if the donor is evolving along the sub - giant branch when the rlof occurs .",
    "the code stops if it is on the red giant branch phase due to numerical instability .",
    "it also stops if the sum of the two components radius is equal to or larger than the orbital radius , which marks the moment when a merger occurs . as",
    "the modifications of internal structure and chemical profile are quite complicated during a merging process and still unclear in knowledge , we consider the merger product as a single star with mass equal to the sum of the two components masses and evolved from its zero age main sequence ( zams ) to an age equal to 13 gyr minus the time of the merger .",
    "the hydrogen fuel in its core is calculated as the sum of the central hydrogen left in the two components when merging happens .    as an illustrative example of a binary system experiencing mt and producing a bss in m30 , we calculated a binary with metallicity appropriate for the cluster ( @xmath16 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1999b ) , composed of a primary ( donor ) with @xmath17 and a secondary ( accretor ) with @xmath18 , and having an initial orbital radius of @xmath19 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolutionary tracks of the two components ( dashed and dotted lines for the primary and the secondary , respectively ) .",
    "both tracks are interpolated using the time step of the component for which the calculation stops first .",
    "we also report a few symbols along the evolutionary tracks to flag reference events in the evolution of the two components : ( 1 ) the beginning of the mt process ( open squares ) , ( 2 ) the epoch at which the mass ratio ( @xmath20 ) is equal to one ( open stars ) , ( 3 ) the end of the mt process ( solid squares ) , and ( 4 ) the location at 13 gyr ( open circles ) .",
    "it is shown that the two components severely depart from the regular evolutionary tracks after mt begins . actually , according to case - b mt",
    ", the primary is just leaving its ms when the rlof occurs , at the age of @xmath21 gyr ( open square along the dashed line ) .",
    "after mt stops at the age of @xmath22 gyr ( filled square along the dashed line ) , the primary follows the evolutionary behavior of a single star again and eventually evolves into a white dwarf . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the secondary gains mass and becomes progressively more luminous .",
    "mt stops while the secondary is still in its ms phase ( solid square in the dotted line ) .",

    "hence , in order to perform an appropriate comparison with the observations , for each synthetic bss we computed the total light as the sum of the luminosities of the two components , at each evolutionary step . to this end",
    ", we used our set of models , which describe the properties ( e.g. , effective temperature , luminosity , mass and surface gravity ) of each component of the binary system along their evolutionary tracks .",
    "in particular , from the effective temperature and gravity we constructed synthetic spectrum for each component by linearly interpolating between relevant spectra from the @xmath31 library ( castelli & kurucz 2004 ) .",
    "then , the magnitudes have been obtained by convolving the spectrum with the throughput curves of the photometric filters . specifically for this work ,",
    "as the observational data for m30 have been acquired in the f555w and f814w filters of the wfpc2 on board the hst , the throughput curves have been directly downloaded from the @xmath32 website .",
    "the zero - points have been calculated by making the @xmath33-band magnitude of vega equal to 0.03 , and all its colors equal to 0.00 . also the vega spectrum has been extracted from the @xmath34 library .",
    "the synthetic magnitude of two components is calculated with the following formula : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the @xmath38-band magnitudes of the binary , the primary , and the secondary , respectively .    the evolutionary track of the selected binary system in the absolute cmd ( m@xmath39m@xmath40 , m@xmath41 ) is presented in figure 2 in thick solid line . as in figure 1 ,",
    "the dashed and the dotted lines are the tracks of the primary and the secondary , respectively .",
    "the two thin solid lines are the 7.54 and 13 gyr isochrones .",
    "the figure clearly shows that before the inversion of the mass ratio ( star symbols ) , the ( higher luminosity ) primary component dominates the synthetic track of the binary system , but after that moment , the secondary becomes dominating and the binary system evolves towards the bss region in the cmd .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the color of the synthetic binary as a function of time .",
    "the combined analysis of figures 2 and 3 suggests that , after a short initial period during which the luminosity of the binary decreases because the ( dominant ) primary component is losing mass , the system starts to become progressively brighter and bluer with time . at an age of @xmath42 gyr the binary is brighter and bluer than the ms turnoff point of the cluster population , thus finally appearing as a bss .",
    "the system remains in the bss region of the cmd for the following 3 - 4 gyr , before deviating toward the red giant branch .",
    "in order to construct a population of synthetic bsss originated from mt binaries and compare its distribution in the cmd with the observations of m30 , we adopted the following procedure :    * we build a grid of binary evolution models formally including all possible binary systems able to generate a bss currently observable in m30 ; * we randomly generated a large number of binaries by extracting the values of the three basic parameters characterizing each system ( the masses of the two components and the orbital separation ) from appropriate distribution functions ; * for those binaries generated in step @xmath43 and covered by the grid constructed in step @xmath44 , we identified their most appropriate stellar models by multi - dimensional interpolation within the grid ; * all such binaries ( from step @xmath45 ) that appear to be brighter and bluer than the ms turnoff of m30 have been retained as bsss and included in what we call the `` synthetic bss reservoir '' , and that is used for the comparison with the observations .",
    "the following sections provides the details of such a procedure .      in order to investigate how bsss originated via mt in primordial binaries populate the cmd of an old gc ( as m30 )",
    ", a grid including all the models of primordial binaries that have started mt and/or merging process and can survive at least for 13  gyr is required .",
    "we therefore calculated binary models assuming suitable combinations of their basic parameters , each model ( either `` pure '' mt , or binary merger ) representing a node of the grid .",
    "as the work focuses on the contribution of case - b mt to the bss population in a star cluster like m30 , and the turnoff mass of a 13  gyr isochrone is @xmath46 , the range of initial mass for the primary is set to 0.7 - 1.1 @xmath15 , with steps of 0.1 @xmath15 .",
    "the upper limit , @xmath47 , is used because a binary system with 1.2 @xmath15 primary can barely survive 13  gyr .",
    "the initial mass range of the secondary is wider : we use 0.3 - 1.1 @xmath15 , with steps of 0.1 @xmath15 .",
    "the lower limit is set by the minimum mass of a secondary that , in 13  gyr , can experience mt from a primary in the adopted mass range .",
    "the orbital separation ranges from 1.0 to 10 @xmath28 , with intervals of 0.1 @xmath28 .",
    "the ranges set for these three parameters cover all the possibilities of making a bss from a case - b mt binary in an old cluster as m30 .",
    "note that in a few cases the code stops because the evolutionary stage is numerically unstable .",
    "thus a few nodes of the grid can be missed .",

    "then , the binaries covered by the grid were extracted , and their corresponding stellar evolutionary status at 13  gyr were determined by means of a multi - dimensional interpolation among the nodes of the grid confining the values of initial @xmath66 and @xmath62 . since some of the grid nodes are merger models ( see section 3.1 ) , we flag as `` merger - important '' those binaries for which at least half of the nodes used during the interpolation corresponds to mergers .",
    "for a proper comparison with the observations , we took into account only synthetic binaries that , at the age of 13  gyr , show photometric properties consistent with the actual definition of bss in m30 , i.e. , that appear bluer and brighter than the current location of the cluster ms turnoff point in the cmd . for each monte - carlo simulation",

    "according to the evolutionary tracks shown in figure 2 , the synthetic mt - bsss cover a wide strip in the cmd corresponding to various stages of mt activity during the bss formation process .",

    "according to f09 , this boundary well corresponds to the cmd location of the @xmath16 zams shifted by 0.75 in magnitude .",
    "very interestingly , this low - luminosity boundary follows the red side of the gap between the two observed bss sequences , thus demonstrating that no mt - bsss can reach the location of the blue - bss sequence . in turn , this provides further support to the fact that the two bss sequences found in m30 are generated by two distinct formation mechanisms .",
    "the overall distribution of synthetic bsss shown in figure 4 provides a nice view of the mt - bss domain in the cmd of an old star cluster . as the next step , in order to have a more direct comparison with the observations ( where 25 bsss are counted along the red sequence ) , we performed random extractions of sub - samples of 25 objects from the synthetic mt - bss reservoir and studied their distribution in the cmd . to evaluate the relative contribution of mt and binary merging to the total population , in this analysis we also distinguished mt - produced bsss from merger - important bsss .",

    "the populations of 25 synthetic bsss are presented in the other 8 panels , where the red solid circles represent mt - produced bsss , and the red open stars are merger - important bsss . a grey strip corresponding to the observed blue sequence is also marked for reference in all the panels . as can be seen from figure  5 , the mt - produced bsss dominate the red population , providing at least @xmath72 of the total observed number in all cases .",
    "m30 is the first star cluster where two distinct sequences of bsss have been observed and have been interpreted as the result of the two bss formation channels ( f09 ) : blue - bsss are generated by stellar collisions , red - bsss derive from mt activity in close binaries .",
    "indeed the blue sequence was found to be nicely reproduced by collisional isochrones ( sills et al .",
    "2009 ) , while only a preliminary guess about the mt - origin for the red - bsss was provided in f09 on the basis of binary evolution models calculated by tian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the open cluster m67 . in this work we presented binary evolution models specifically computed for m30 and finally provided convincing evidence that the red - sequence is indeed populated by mt - bsss .",
    "we calculated a grid of binary evolution models covering the parameter space ( in terms of masses of the components and orbital separation ) appropriate for the bsss currently observed in m30 ( age=13  gyr and @xmath16 ) .",
    "we used monte - carlo simulations to randomly generate large numbers of binary systems , we extracted those binaries that can be covered by the grid , we got their physical and photometric properties at 13  gyr by interpolating within the model grid , and finally we obtained a `` reservoir '' of synthetic bsss by taking into account all the grid - covered mt - binaries that are bluer and brighter than the ms turnoff of m30 .",
    "the distribution of these objects in the cmd has been compared to the observed location of the blue- and red - bss sequences .",
    "random extractions of 25 such bsss from the overall reservoir have been used to investigate the relative importance of mt and merger processes for the formation of bsss .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the distribution in the cmd of the synthetic mt - bsss is consistent with the location of the observed red sequence in m30 and never reaches the region occupied by the blue - bsss .",
    "this evidence demonstrates that mt processes are unable to produce such  blue \" objects .",
    "the result also supports the suggestion ( f09 ) that the two parallel sequences observed in m30 are indeed formed by bsss generated by the two distinct formation channels .",
    "* random extractions of 25 synthetic binary - bsss ( the same number of observed red - bsss ) show that the models always nicely reproduce the observed red sequence . *",
    "mt - produced bsss contribute to at least @xmath72 of the total sample , while the remaining @xmath73 bsss may require assistance from binary mergers .",
    "of course , the bss formation mechanisms are far more complex than those investigated in the present paper .",
    "in fact , the internal dynamical evolution of gcs certainly plays a significant role in mixing bsss generated by the different channels , especially in the cluster cores .",
    "hence , distinguishing the two populations is not an easy task . in m30 and",
    "a few additional clusters ( ngc  362 and ngc 1261 ; see dalessandro et al .",
    "2013 and simunovic et al .",
    "2014 , respectively ) , two populations of bsss appear separated by a gap in the cmd , thus opening the possibility to investigate them in more details . indeed the evidence collected to date and the work presented here suggest that this is a very promising way to distinguish collisional from mt bsss . however , as pointed out in f09 , the gcs in which the bss populations are distinguishable can be rare , since the gap separating the two sub - populations is not a permanent feature .",
    "in fact , the future evolution of the bsss currently observed along the blue - sequence will move these stars toward the red in the cmd , thus cleaning up the gap in a few gyr . for this reason , a recent burst of collisions ( possibly driven by the collapse of the core ) has been suggested to be at the origin of the tiny and well distinct blue - sequence observed in m30 ( f09 ) .",
    "thoughtful n - body calculations , including internal cluster dynamical evolution , are needed to further investigate the properties of the bss populations in gcs and better clarify the physical processes that play the most relevant roles in shaping their observed characteristics .",

    "<S> two separated sequences of blue straggler stars ( bsss ) have been revealed by ferraro et al . </S>",
