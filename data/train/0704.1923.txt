    "considerable attention has been paid to the relatively strong optical second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in thin films ( @xmath0 symmetry ) and bulk ( @xmath1 symmetry ) of cuprous oxide crystals . which was first addressed in the pioneering work of shen @xcite .",
    "this effect is attributed to the electric - quadrupole @xmath2 exciton effect .",
    "the quadrupole exciton has very small oscillator strength but it possess rather narrow line - width @xmath3 .",
    "so the effect is well pronounced when the exciting laser energy is close to one @xmath4 or two photon resonance @xmath5 . in the dipole approximation",
    "this effect disappears @xcite .",
    "we propose to amplify the shg characteristic of the @xmath6 quadrupole wannier exciton ( we ) in cuprous oxide by making a hybrid with an organic frenkel exciton ( fe ) ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "the idea of resonant enhancement of some non - linear properties generic to semiconductor dipole - allowed wannier - mott ( we ) excitons was presented in pioneering work of @xcite for the layered organic - inorganic heterostructures .",
    "it was also developed for quantum wires and dots embedded into organic shell @xcite,@xcite or attached to dendrimer structure @xcite,@xcite .    in our previous work @xcite",
    "we demonstrated considerable enhancement of another non - linear effect in cuprous oxide , photo - thermal bi - stability @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated a considerable enhancement in the hysteresis - like region size ( from @xmath7 for bulk cuprous oxide to @xmath8 for the hybrid ) .",
    "the enhancement was attributed to the large oscillator strength of the hybrid exciton inherited from the organic part and still rather narrow line - width of the same order as the coupling .",
    "analogous enhancement can be expected for the shg , which is the subject of this paper .    in section 2",
    "we propose a pump - prob experiment to reveal the shg enhancement due to the resonant dynamical hybridization and briefly discuss relevant quadrupole hybrid exciton properties . in the next section 3 we address the question how this resonant enhancement depends on such parameters of the system as oscillator strengths and damping of the fe and we constituting the hybrid . using a classical model of nonlinear coupled oscillators ,",
    "we demonstrate that while the big ratio of the hybrid oscillator strength suggests many orders of the enhancement magnitude it is actually somehow reduced by the rather small coupling parameter and density of the fe .    because the fe is dynamically brought into resonance with the we there is an important hybridization time @xmath9 parameter .",
    "hence , in the section 4 , we develop more sophisticated quantum mechanical model to address the dynamics of the hybrid shg .",
    "namely we show that the signal enhancement drastically depends on the either the one probes the system before or after the hybridization occurred .",
    "in this work we adopt the concept of a layered organic - inorganic heterostructure .",
    "the inorganic component of the hybrid is a thin layer of @xmath10 ( quantum well , latter in the text referred to as qw ) grown upon a film of the organic composite ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) . due to the small radius of both the we and fe exciton part of the hybrid",
    "one can neglect the effect of confinement . in this case",
    "one can not tune the two types of excitons in resonance by adjusting the confinement ( @xmath11 to the cuprous oxide unit cell @xmath12 ) .",
    "the qw confinement just assures the we propagate along the interface and is the subjected to the electric field gradient of the fe propagating along the adjacent chain of the dcm2 molecules .",
    "quantum well provides the @xmath6 quadrupole we .",
    "the dcm2 part of the organic solid state solute provides dipole allowed fe ( set of small arrows ) ; the ps host prevents wave function overlapping between organic and inorganic excitons ; ca under proper concentration allows tuning of the excitons into the resonance.,width=325 ]    to provide resonance between we in cuprous oxide and fe in the organic , we proposed utilization of solid state solvation ( sss ) of the dcm2 - quinolizin - 9 - yl ) - ethenyl ] - 4h - pyran - 4 - ylidene ] propane dinitritle . ] molecules in transparent polystyrene ( ps ) host doped with camorphic anhydride ( ca)@xcite . the sss is a type of solvatochromism manifesting itself as some change in the spectral position of the absorption / luminescence band due to change in the polarity of the medium .",
    "the frster dipole - dipole non - resonant interaction between dcm2 and ca modifies the energy structure of the involved molecules .    during the slow phase ( @xmath13 ) the energy of the fe experiences a red shift linear with the ca concentration due to non - resonant dipole - dipole interaction with the ca molecules . not that our model capitalizes on the fact that dcm2 molecules form a 2d layer rather than been diluted in the ps : ca solvent which is the case of currently manufactured optical light emitting devices ( oled )",
    "this allows us to neglect rather complicated problem of the inhomogeneous broadening of the fe energy by utilizing a _",
    "mean field _ approximation . for the mean field approximation the red spectral shift of the fe energy in resonance with the quadrupole",
    "we can be accomplished with @xmath14 ca concentration .    to avoid complicated problems of time dependent hybridization and",
    "stay within the analytical model framework , we assume that the fe and we are in exact resonance once the dcm2 energy is in close proximity to the we energy i.e. @xmath15 . we introduced the quadrupole - dipole coupling parameter @xmath16 @xcite",
    "( see also appendix ( [ eq:1_1 ] ) ) .",
    "this resonant coupling gives rise to the upper and lower branches of the quadrupole - dipole hybrid ( qdh ) dispersion : ) or the hamiltonian ( [ eq:3_2 ] ) ] @xmath17 . to populate both of the branches one needs a second pumping photon tuned into resonance with the @xmath6 transition .",
    "the radiation field interacts through both dipole and quadrupole part of the hybrid .",
    "the dipole interaction can be utilized to produce linear response signal due to the pumping @xcite . by using the non - linear response to the prob signal",
    ", the second harmonic can be generated through the quadrupole part of the hybrid .",
    "different shg regimes can be achieved by changing the timing between pumping and prob signals ( see section [ quantum ] for more details ) .    according to the selection rules for the quadrupole - dipole hybrid the pumping signal , running along the organic - inorganic interface of the heterostructure ,",
    "induces the linear polarization in the @xmath18 direction @xcite .",
    "the prob signal induces the second order non - linear response in the cuprous oxide . which is perpendicular to the interface , and defined by the second order polarization along the @xmath19 direction ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the net polarization is given by a second rank tensor through the following expression : @xmath20 here @xmath21 are the electric field of the pumping and prob lasers correspondingly .",
    "the @xmath19 component of the prob signal wave vector is taken to be close to zero to avoid possible interference in momentum conservation . for the sake of simplicity we are going to omit , @xmath19 and @xmath22 indexes of the tensor keeping in mind that the wave vector of the pump signal has only @xmath19 component and",
    "the sh signal is perpendicular to it and the prob signal polarization : @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we develop both classical and quantum mechanical models , which can be used to find a specific form of the hybrid second order nonlinear susceptibility . in section [ anharmonic ]",
    "we demonstrate that the second order non linearity ( generic to the cuprous oxide and introduced through a small parameter @xmath24 ) is enhanced due to the resonant quadrupole - dipole hybridization with the organic ( see ( [ eq:2_7 ] ) ) . in section [ quantum ]",
    "we develop quantum theory of the enhanced shg .",
    "it allows investigation of different regimes of the process defined by the time ordering between the prob pulse and the time when the fe and we energies are close enough to form the hybrid .",
    "we generalize the concept of the double - sided feynman diagrams @xcite to include non radiative processes of the energy exchange between dcm2 and ca as well as resonant qdh between dcm2 and cuprous oxide .",
    "as a first step , we will use the simplest classical model neglecting the non - local effects of the linear @xmath25 and non - linear susceptibility @xmath26 to describe the hybrid shg .",
    "namely , we adopt an extension of the anharmonic oscillator model @xcite generalized for the case of resonant coupling between two distinct sets of oscillators .",
    "this simplified picture only covers the case when the pumping field is polarized along @xmath27 $ ] axis ( @xmath28 ) and we prob the hybrid system ( @xmath29 ) with a signal perpendicular to the interface and polarized along @xmath30 $ ] direction ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we consider the we in cuprous oxide as an assembly of the oscillators with the oscillator strength per unit cell given by @xmath32 ( see for example reference @xcite ) .",
    "the second set of the oscillators with the oscillator strength given by @xmath33 corresponds to the fe in the organic .    treating the wave vector @xmath34 as just another parameter unless we put an emphasis on it ] ,",
    "the polarization @xmath35 due to we and fe can be written in terms of the effective electron - hole displacements @xmath36 as : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the area of the interface and @xmath39 are the we and fe bohr radius , @xmath40 is the electron charge .",
    "the surface density of the we and fe excitons are @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspondingly and @xmath43 is the total number of the oscillators .",
    "here we also took into account the low density ( @xmath44 ) of the dcm2 molecules in the organic to avoid the aggregation effect @xcite .    in the time frame of the hybridization @xmath45",
    ", the we and fe energies are at perfect resonance .",
    "hence , the system of equations governing the oscillators dynamics can be written in the form : @xmath46 the nonlinear factor @xmath47 appears due to the prob signal .",
    "it is defined such that @xmath24 has dimensions of reciprocal length and is considered to be small in a sense that it is much less than the reciprocal of the maximum displacement of fe ( @xmath48 ) and we ( @xmath49 ) oscillator .",
    "the exact value of @xmath24 can be obtained either from an experiment or from the microscopic quantum theory ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath50 describe the qdh damping .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath51 describe the quadrupole - dipole coupling .",
    "hence , the eigenvalues of the linearized system of equations ( [ eq:2_2 ] ) give both branches of the qdh .",
    "the system is driven dominantly by the light - dipole interaction in the organic and the quadrupole - light interaction is neglected ( @xmath52 is the electron mass ) .    using standard perturbation theory with respect to the small parameter @xmath24 in zero order ( neglecting the quadratic term ) and combining equations ( [ eq:1_3],[eq:2_1],[eq:2_2 ] ) one has the linear response of the hybrid and bulk cuprous oxide given by the following expressions : @xmath53 including the nonlinear term as a source for the shg to first order in the perturbation parameter , there is a displacement at @xmath54 .",
    "the shg response is given by a solution of the following system : @xmath55 using the definitions ( [ eq:1_3 ] ) and ( [ eq:2_1 ] ) one gets the following non - linear second order response function for the hybrid and bulk cuprous oxide correspondingly : @xmath56 straightforward comparison of the expressions above evinces the resonant rise of the second order nonlinearity owing to hybridization .",
    "there are several competing factors involved .",
    "the enhancement by means of big oscillator strength ratio @xmath57 is reduced by rather small coupling parameter @xmath58 and small dcm2 density @xmath59 ( see more numerical details in section 5 ) .",
    "although the system of non - linear susceptibilities ( [ eq:2_7 ] ) in principle solves the problem of shg due to the hybrid it does not clarify the origin of the nonlinearity @xmath24 .",
    "also , such an important parameter as the hybridization time @xmath9 is left out of the classical description .",
    "hence , in this section we propose a unified quantum theory of the hybrid shg .",
    "the linear response of the hybrid is due to dipole transitions from the ground @xmath60 state to the fe @xmath61 in the organic and due to quadrupole transitions to the we @xmath62 in the cuprous oxide .",
    "the non - linearities are the result of some intermediate inter - band transitions in the cuprous oxide @xcite .    in cuprous oxide the nearest state in energy to the quadrupole",
    "ortho - exciton @xmath63 is the @xmath64 dipole allowed excitonic band @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "hence it plays the main role in formation of the non - linear response and can be excited by the properly tuned prob signal .",
    "we neglect all the rest of inter - band and intra - band transitions . therefore , the states above form a complete basis for the shg problem : @xmath67 inversion symmetry of the dcm2 is also broken by the ca induced local field and the interface effect . therefore , unlike in classical model",
    ", the contribution from the organic to the shg has to be consider as well .",
    "but due to the smallness of the symmetry breaking local field it contributes a little to the shg enhancement .    using the basis above",
    "let us introduce creation operators for the fe and the @xmath6 and the @xmath68 we exciton @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the commutation algebra of the operators is presented in the appendix ( [ algebra ] ) .",
    "the net polarization of the sample is defined as @xcite : @xmath72 here @xmath73 is an effective dipole moment @xcite due to the quadrupole transitions associated with the oscillator strength ; @xmath74 is the resonant wave vector for bulk cuprous oxide ( appendix ( [ eq:1_0 ] ) ) .",
    "the dipole moment of the transitions from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is defined by @xcite : @xmath77 finally , the dcm2 dipole moment of the transition from @xmath78 to @xmath79 per unit area of the interface is given by @xcite : @xmath80    using equation ( [ eq:3_1 ] ) and the rotating wave approximation for the resonant wave vector @xmath34 , the hybrid hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath81 the linear response from _ both _ branches of the hybrid may be observed by pumping the hybrid with two signals @xmath82 .",
    "the first photon @xmath83 excites dcm2 molecules . during the time period @xmath84 the system relaxes to the fe exciton energy close to @xmath85 thus providing resonance between we and fe .",
    "then the second pumping photon @xmath86 enters and excites quadrupole we so that both qdh branches are populated .",
    "the qdh exciton lives for @xmath9 nano - seconds and then both branches of the hybrid relaxes to the ground state emitting photons of the energy @xmath87 .",

    "a strong sh signal was detected at @xmath109 which has to be attributed not only to the narrow line - width of the quadrupole exciton but to the fact that @xmath110 as well . from the last expression it follows that in this case no increment in the outgoing signal can be expected due to the hybridization effect .",
    "the third order nonlinearity is responsible as well for some small contribution to the shg due to the non - zero ground state dipole moment of the dcm2 molecules @xcite . in the local electric field created by",
    "the polar ca molecules on the interface @xmath111 , the sh signal is due to the third order susceptibility @xmath112 .",

    "in order to make a numerical comparison of the hybrid and bulk shg the life - time of the hybrid plays a major role .",
    "considering the bi - stability effect in the hybrid @xcite we assumed that the cuprous oxide has purity of @xmath113 with the reported line - width of @xmath114 ( pico - second lifetime ) @xcite . therefore the hybrid life - time",
    "is dominated by its inorganic part @xmath115 . to compensate for such big line - width we also assumed that the dcm2 is presented as a thin film embedded into ps host close to the interface with the cuprous oxide . for the non - linear absorption experiment",
    "this assumption can be justified as it makes the absorption length of the hybrid equal to the narrow region around the interface , of the size of the hybrid itself .",
    "but there is a drawback in that model due to possible aggregation of the dcm2 .",
    "hence in this article we adopted the picture of disordered organic and higher purity of the inorganic crystal . this will bring the line - width and the coupling parameter to the same order .",

    "asymmetry between this two branches is a result of quantum effects and not present in the classical anharmonic oscillator picture .",
    "we also included the corrections due to interface effect in the organic in our numerical simulation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity let us consider two distinct cases .",
    "first , the pump laser is perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the states up to @xmath125 are populated thermally .",
    "no hybridization occurs and it is equivalent to the bulk case shg ( see fig.[fig:2 ] dotted curve ) . the maximum power generated by the second - harmonic is proportional to the square of the following expression : @xmath126 the small relative value of the shg is due to the narrowness of the cuprous oxide quantum well .",

    "finally , comparing the last expression ( [ eq:4_2 ] ) to the bulk cuprous oxide ( [ eq:4_1 ] ) the second order response of the hybrid is amplified by the factor : @xmath134 therefore the amplification can be adjusted by manipulating the organic composition ( dcm2 and ca densities ) or changing the pump laser incidence angle .    finally , we would like to note that there is another merit in using the hybrid structure for the shg .",
    "namely the fact that the optical pumping can be replaced by an electrical pumping .",
    "for this the hybrid sample has to be placed between alq3 and a - npd @xcite semiconductor plates .",
    "the bond structure and offset of these materials provide electrons and holes to form the hybrid exciton on the interface .",

    "in this paper we addressed possibility to enhance shg signal @xmath135 generic to a cuprous oxide bulk crystal as the lowest excitation in this material has quadrupole origin . to demonstrate the concept we proposed to consider a pump - prob experiment performed on cuprous oxide sandwiched between the organic composite .",
    "an intense pump signal excites one part of the organic known as dcm2 ( fe ) .",
    "non - resonant ( frster ) energy transfer in the organic layer ( `` solid state solvation '' effect ) provides dynamical red shift of the fe .",
    "when the fe energy is close enough to the quadrupole allowed 1s exciton in the adjacent cuprous oxide the quadrupole - dipole hybridization occurs due to the fe induced gradient of the electric field penetrating into the inorganic layer .",
    "the prob signal is designed to reveal the shg signal .",
    "the resonant enhancement of the @xmath135 occurs for the hybrid exciton shares properties of both quadrupole we ( long radiative lifetime ) and organic fe ( big oscillator strength ) .",
    "it quadrupole part allows @xmath135 to be non - vanishing . while it s fe part provides the enhancement of the shg signal compared to the bare cuprous oxide crystal due to more efficient absorption of the pump signal by means of large oscillator strength of the hybrid .    however , as we demonstrated in the classical coupled oscillator model framework , the enhancement is determined not only by the big ratio of the corresponding organic / inorganic oscillator strengths but somehow quenched by the small coupling parameter and low dcm2 density . by varying those parameters one the hybrid shg signal",
    "may be enhanced by orders of magnitude compared with the generic ( cuprous oxide ) one .    to reveal the enhancement dependence on such an important parameter of the hybrid as the hybridization time @xmath9 we proposed more sophisticated quantum theory .",
    "it suggests that there is substantial difference in the hybrid shg signal provided one probes the system before or after the hybridization occurred . in the first case the sh",
    "is generated at @xmath136 frequency .",
    "hence it is vastly suppressed by the short life time of the dipole - allowed 2p we in cuprous oxide .",
    "nevertheless , if one probes the system after the hybridization had happened , the sh is generated at @xmath137 and is heightened by the big oscillator strength of the hybrid and it s small damping coefficient .",

    "<S> we report calculated substantial enhancement of the second harmonic generation ( shg ) in cuprous oxide crystals resonantly hybridized with an appropriate organic material ( dcm2:ca : ps solid - state solvent ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole origin of the inorganic part of the quadrupole - dipole hybrid provides inversion symmetry breaking and the organic part contributes to the oscillator strength of the hybrid . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the enhancement of the shg , compared to bulk cuprous oxide crystal , is proportional to the ratio of the dcm2 dipole moment and the effective dipole moment of the quadrupole transitions in the cuprous oxide . </S>",
    "<S> it is also inversely proportional to the line - width of the hybrid and bulk excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement may be regulated by adjusting the organic blend ( mutual concentration of the dcm2 and ca part of the solvent ) and pumping conditions(varying the angle of incidence in case of optical pumping or populating the minimum of the lower branch of the hybrid in case of electrical pumping ) . </S>"
