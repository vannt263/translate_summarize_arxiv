    "heavy baryons provide a testing ground to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "experiments are accumulating more and more data on heavy baryons @xcite . for the theoretical calculation ,",
    "the task is to apply model - independent methods of the nonperturbative qcd . for the heavy hadrons containing a single heavy quark , the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite",
    "can be applied successfully . after combining the chiral symmetry , the low energy effective theory of hqet , the heavy hadron chiral lagrangian ( hhcl )",
    "@xcite extends the application area further .",
    "recently , the @xmath1 expansion approach @xcite incorporates in more understanding of qcd to the baryon sector .",
    "the heavy baryon decays @xmath0 @xcite are interesting from the point of view of the above mentioned approaches . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the most interesting weak transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are simplified greatly .",
    "the numbers of the independent form factors are reduced to one and two , respectively in these two transitions .",
    "the decays @xmath14 @xcite however , are predicted to be both @xmath15 and @xmath1 suppressed .",
    "they provide a test to the hqet .",
    "the decays @xmath0 , on the other hand , are neither @xmath15 nor @xmath1 suppressed",
    ". they may be the dominant modes of the decays @xmath16 , although they are phase space suppressed .",
    "we will calculate them in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the calculation involves in the hhcl by assuming the pion being soft .",
    "it also needs the three form factors of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the large @xmath11 limit",
    ", there is a light quark spin - flavor symmetry in the baryon sector .",
    "this leads to the fact that only one form factor is independent among the three @xcite .",
    "it is argued that this result is true until to the order of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , after a brief review of the hhcl , the invariant matrix elements of the decays are calculated in this framework with the help of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "iii describes necessary kinematics for the phase space integration and presents the numerical results .",
    "the discussion and summary are made in sec .",
    "the dynamics of the decays @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "1 , which includes both the strong and the weak interactions .",
    "the strong interaction is described by the hhcl in the case of the pion being soft .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory is the low energy effective theory of qcd for the light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "these mesons are regarded as the goldstone bosons due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xmath18 in qcd .",
    "the eight goldstone boson fields , namely the pion , the kaon and the @xmath19-meson fields , can be represented in the nonlinear exponential form @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the pion decay constant , @xmath23 . it is convenient to introduce @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 transform under the chiral symmetry as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the special unitary matrix @xmath29 is a complicated nonlinear function of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . to the leading order of the derivative expansion , the effective lagrangian for these goldstone bosons is @xmath33    heavy baryons can be included in the chiral lagrangian formalism . the ground state heavy baryons can be classified into two categories .",
    "one is the @xmath34 sextet field @xmath35 which describes the heavy baryons whose light quarks have one unit of angular momentum .",
    "the resulting total angular momentum of these baryons is either 1/2 or 3/2 .",
    "@xmath36 is written as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath3 is the 4-velocity of the heavy baryon .",
    "@xmath38 is the dirac field and @xmath39 is its spin-3/2 counterpart .",
    "@xmath38 represents the following @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 and @xmath39 has a similar form .",
    "the superscripts denote the charge and the isospin . under the chiral symmetry",
    ", @xmath42 transforms as @xmath43 under the heavy quark spin @xmath44 symmetry , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 generator and @xmath48 is an infinitesimal parameter .",
    "the other component in the classification is the @xmath34 anti - triplet field @xmath49 corresponding to the baryons whose light quarks have zero angular momentum . the resulting total angular momentum of the baryons is 1/2 . it can be expressed as @xmath50 where the dirac field @xmath51 stands for @xmath52 under the chiral symmetry , it transforms as @xmath53 under the @xmath44 , it transforms just like ( [ su(2 ) ] ) .    to the leading order of the derivative expansion , the effective lagrangian of the strong interaction of @xmath42 and @xmath49 with the goldstone bosons , which is invariant under the chiral symmetry and the heavy quark symmetry is @xcite @xmath54     + \\delta \\bar{s}^{\\mu}_{ij } s^{ij}_{\\mu }    \\big\\}~ , \\label{int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 s ( @xmath56 ) denote the coupling constants and the covariant derivatives are @xmath57 and @xmath58 the mass difference between the sextet and the anti - triplet baryons is @xmath59 we have neglected the mass differences between the @xmath60 and @xmath61 which is @xmath15 suppressed .",
    "the weak interaction of @xmath62 is described by @xmath63 and the hadronic current in the heavy quark limit can be re - expressed by the matter fields as @xmath64    { \\bar s}^\\alpha_c(v^\\prime)\\gamma_\\mu\\frac{1-\\gamma_5}{2 } s^\\beta_b(v )    \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\eta(v\\cdot v^\\prime){\\bar t}_c(v^\\prime)\\gamma_\\mu       \\frac{1-\\gamma_5}{2}t_b(v)\\big\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the isgur - wise functions . and",

    "to get the decay rate distributions , the following values are used , @xmath87 the value of @xmath88 is @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we adopt two forms for @xmath90 .",
    "one is a linear fitting of the result from qcd sum rule @xmath91 @xcite ; and the other is an exponential function from large @xmath11 qcd @xmath92 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the numerical results of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are given in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the decay rate distributions on @xmath67 , pion energy and lepton energy are shown .",
    "the results of the two kinds of isgur - wise function are compared .",
    "the total decay rates are obtained as @xmath95 and hence the branching ratios are @xmath96 for the linear ( exponential ) @xmath90 . compared with the result of @xmath97 @xcite , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "they are less dependent on the isgur - wise function because of the partial cancellation of it in the ratios .",
    "we have calculated the decays @xmath0 in the heavy quark , chiral and large @xmath11 limits .",
    "the differential decay spectra are presented .",
    "the branching ratios are obtained as @xmath100 1.21  ( 0.971 )  % , and @xmath101 0.798  ( 0.640 )  % with @xmath90 from qcd sum rule ( large @xmath11 qcd ) .",
    "let us discuss the accuracy of these approximations .",
    "first , consider the finite heavy quark mass correction .",
    "we have taken @xmath102 .",
    "generally the size of the @xmath15 correction can be around @xmath103 .",
    "the detailed consideration indicates that the correction maybe smaller . in the calculation , there are two places where the heavy quark limit is applied .",
    "one is in the weak transition where the quark current was replaced by the baryonic matrix elements . for the @xmath12 transition ,",
    "the @xmath15 correction was calculated to be @xmath104 @xcite . however , there is no estimation for the @xmath15 correction to the @xmath13 transition .",
    "it is experiential to guess that the correction in this case is also at the @xmath105 level .",
    "the other place where the heavy quark limit was used is in the description of the strong interaction , namely in the hhcl .",
    "the difference between the coupling @xmath88 for the bottom quark and that for the charm quark , and the difference between the masses of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , have been neglected .",
    "theoretically these differences are both @xmath15 and @xmath17 suppressed @xcite .",
    "note that practically @xmath106 mev @xcite which is smaller than the pion mass .",
    "hence the correction in the second place is very small @xmath107 . from the above discussion",
    ", we expect that the @xmath15 correction to our results is less than @xmath108 , and is probably around @xmath105 .",
    "second , the validity of the soft pion limit should be addressed .",
    "the calculation is valid in the phase space region where the pion energy is smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale which is argued to be at @xmath109 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore for a large part of phase space , the calculation is expected to be reliable .",
    "however , the subleading terms in the derivative expansion in the effective lagrangian have been omitted . and because of the unknown coefficients of the subleading terms , it is still not possible to include them in the calculation .",
    "the correction due to these terms is at the order of @xmath110 or @xmath111 which is less than @xmath112 if the pion is really soft , say @xmath113 gev . for the total decay rate ,",
    "the results we have obtained maybe subject to larger correction .    finally , the @xmath1 expansion used in the calculation needs to be explicated .",
    "the calculation needs the information of the three isgur - wise functions of the transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the large @xmath11 limit ,",
    "the three form factors are related to each other @xcite .",
    "these relations are argued to be valid to the order of @xmath17 @xcite due to the light quark spin - flavor symmetry in the baryon sector in the large @xmath11 limit .",
    "the argument goes like that as in ref .",
    "it is the relation among the form factors , not the knowledge about the form factor itself , that we are considering .",
    "therefore the application of these relations causes @xmath114 uncertainty .    up to the above approximations ,",
    "the calculation is in principle model - independent . to get the final numerical results , the model result for the @xmath12 isgur - wise function has to be used",
    "this step brings one more source of uncertainty . according to the model results we adopted ,",
    "the uncertainty is at @xmath108 level .",
    "the decays @xmath0 are indeed experimentally interesting according to our results .",
    "the estimated branching ratios of the decays are not small .",
    "the experiment has been studying the channel @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "a lot of data on @xmath5 can be expected to emerge in the near future from cdf , d0 , hera - b , and lhc - b and so on . with high statistics of the data , the decay channels @xmath0 can be discovered .    in the near future",
    ", more reliable theoretical results for the baryonic isgur - wise functions can be obtained , even for that appear in the subleading order of the heavy quark expansion , from lattice hqet or the other model - independent methods . that will give more accurate results of the decay distributions and decay rates .",
    "the uncertainties due to the heavy quark limit , large @xmath11 limit and the model - dependence can be reduced to @xmath105 or smaller . in this case , the precise experimental measurement for @xmath0 will give more information about the validity range of the hhcl .",
