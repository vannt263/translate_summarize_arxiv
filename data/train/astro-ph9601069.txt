    "an important problem in cosmology is that of finding out the source of the density perturbations leading to the large scale structure formation .",
    "competing models are inflationary scenarios and topological defects , these latter formed as the consequence of a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe .    a possible way of trying to discriminate between models is given by the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation predicted by them .",

    "the cmb anisotropies produced in inflationary models are nearly gaussian distributed .",
    "defect  induced large scale structure formation has been well studied recently @xcite and its predictions confront successfully against a large bulk of observational data .",
    "the amplitude of the anisotropies , which can be determined using the _ cobe_dmr data , is directly related to the symmetry breaking energy scale and corresponds to a grand unification theory ( gut ) phase transition . however , the production of anisotropy maps from numerical simulations of the field equations turns out to be a fabulous task , and therefore some analytical insight is desirable .",
    "this is the reason why people turned to consider analytical ( although simplified ) models for cmb anisotropies generated by defects , wherein the physics is more transparent and computations can be pursued straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "although it is clear that full range numerical simulations will have the last word regarding these and other observable signatures of defects , in the meantime progress with these simplified models can hint some of their main features .",

    "cmb anisotropies in defect theories are produced during the photon travel all the way from the last scattering surface to here .",
    "the computation is quite involved because it requires simulations following the defects , matter and photon evolution over a large number of expansion times @xcite . in the case of textures ,",
    "the non  linear evolution of the scalar field responsible for texture formation is the source of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "as long as the characteristic length scale of these defects is larger than the hubble radius @xmath17 the gradients of the field are frozen in and can not affect the surrounding matter components . however ,",
    "when the size of the texture becomes comparable to @xmath17 ( this latter grows linearly with cosmic time ) , microphysical processes can ` push ' the global fields so that they acquire trivial field configurations , reduce their energy ( which is radiated away as goldstone bosons ) and , in those cases where the field was wounded in knots , they unwind . in",
    "this process perturbations in the spacetime metric are generated , and hence also the photon geodesics are affected .",
    "these unwinding events are mainly characterised by one length scale , that of the hubble radius at the moment of collapse , implying that the resulting perturbations arise at a fixed rate per hubble volume and hubble time . this scaling property means that the defect network looks statistically the same at any time , once its characteristic length is normalised to @xmath17 . then , by dividing the sky cone into cells corresponding to expansion times and hubble volumes , one can restrict to the study of the cmb pattern induced in hubble  size boxes during one hubble time .",

    "texture configurations giving rise to spots in the cmb are assumed to arise with a constant probability per hubble volume and hubble time . by dividing the whole volume in boxes of surface @xmath22 and thickness",
    "@xmath23 we may write the volume probability density of spot generation in the sky as follows @xmath24    = 9 cm = 8 cm    where @xmath19 is the mean number of cmb spots expected to be produced in a hubble volume and in a hubble time .",

    "a spot appearing at time @xmath33 has typically a size @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the angular size of the horizon at @xmath33 , and where @xmath45    as spot anisotropies are generated by causal seeds , their angular size can not exceed the size of the horizon at that time and thus @xmath46 .",

    "this is precisely what happens for spots generated by spherically symmetric self ",
    "similar ( ssss ) texture unwinding events @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the ssss solution are not characteristic of spot arising from more realistic random configurations .",
    "borrill et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that randomly generated texture field configurations produce anisotropy patterns with very different properties to the exact ssss solution .",
    "furthermore , spots generated from concentrations of energy gradients which do not lead to unwinding events can still produce anisotropies very similar to those generated by unwindings .",
    "the peak anisotropy of the random configurations turns out to be 20 to 40 % smaller than the ssss solution .",
    "moreover , their results also suggest an asymmetry between maxima @xmath71 and minima @xmath72 of the peaks for all studied configurations other than the ssss , although with large error bars .",
    "they justify this result as due to the fact that , for unwinding events , the minima are generated earlier in the evolution ( photons climbing out of the collapsing texture ) than the maxima ( photons falling in the collapsing texture ) , and thus the field correlations are stronger for the maxima , which enhance the anisotropies .",
    "up to this point we have left unspecified the profile of the spots , the distribution of the brightness factor @xmath73 , the typical size of the spots @xmath20 and the number density of spots @xmath19 .",
    "we have to fix them in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the three ",
    "point function and the cosmic variance .",
    "we will essentially rely on the results of the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , where all these issues are addressed to some extent .",
    "these simulations indicate that the size of the spots are approximately 10% of the hubble radius when generated , hence we take the scaling size @xmath74 .",
    "there is no particular form of the spot profiles obtained in the simulations .",
    "however , a gaussian function , as given by the profile @xmath75 looks as a good approximation to the bell  shaped spots obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will adopt it here for the numerical computations . another interesting result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite regards the number of spots produced : whereas only 4 out of 100 simulations showed unwinding events , the number density of nonunwinding events ( which as we mentioned above also lead to spots ) is much greater , typically of the order of one such event per simulation .",
    "this implies a mean number of cmb spots per hubble volume and hubble time @xmath76 .",
    "we need also the distribution of the spot brightness @xmath73 in order to compute the mean values of the powers of the random variable @xmath77 , @xmath78 , appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ collxx ] ) and ( [ colltexturms ] ) . as we do not have at our disposal the full distribution of values obtained in the simulations and we just know the mean value of the maxima and the minima , we will make a crude estimate by considering that all the hot spots appear with the same @xmath79 and all the cold spots with the same @xmath80 .",
    "then , all the @xmath78 needed can readily be obtained in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from the two  point correlation function of the _",
    "cobe_dmr data , we can normalize the amplitude of the anisotropies and fix @xmath83 .",
    "we do this by fixing @xmath84 @xcite which , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ ana6 ] ) , leads to @xmath85 .",
    "the other parameter , @xmath86 , measures the possible _ asymmetry _ between hot and cold spots and we leave it as a free parameter .",
    "let us note that the amplitude of the spots is directly related to the scale of symmetry breaking . from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 . hence , the symmetry breaking scale results @xmath89 , typical of gut theories",
    ".    we may now apply our formalism to the _ cobe_dmr measurements .",
    "we consider a gaussian window function , @xmath90 , with dispersion of the antenna beam profile @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the analytical formulae obtained in the previous section assumed full  sky coverage .",
    "the effect of partial coverage , due to the cut in the maps at galactic latitudes @xmath92 , increases the cosmic variance by a factor @xmath93 @xcite , and we take it into account by multiplying @xmath94 by this factor in the numerical results .",
    "= 9 cm = 8 cm    figure 2 shows the collapsed three  point function @xmath95 ( solid line ) and the grey band indicates the _ rms _ range of fluctuations expected from the cosmic variance .",
    "we have plotted the results for @xmath96 , which looks as a reasonable value according to ref .",
    "it is easy to find how these results change for other values of the parameter @xmath86 , as the central curve @xmath97 , while the variance @xmath94 is approximately constant for small values of the @xmath86 parameter .",
    "the results do not include the dipole @xmath98 , to match the _ cobe _ analysis .",
    "these results are to be compared with the data in ref .",
    "for all reasonable values of the parameter @xmath86 , the data falls well within the grey band , and thus there is good agreement with the observations .",
    "the cosmic variance band coming from the texture model is significantly larger than that coming from gaussian distributed anisotropies @xcite . it is more than a factor 10 larger for angles smaller than @xmath99 and a factor 5 larger for larger angles .",
    "an increment in the cosmic variance has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the two  point correlation function , and has more extensively been studied in ref .",
    "the fact that the range of expected values for the three  point correlation function predicted by inflation is included into that predicted by textures for all the angles and that the data points fall within them makes it impossible to draw conclusions favouring one of the models , although one may think that the fact that the data covers the full range of the band predicted by inflation means that the observed sky is a typical realization of the ensemble , while it is a less probable realization in the texture model as all the data fall close to the origin and the wide range of values allowed by the cosmic variance is nearly void .    the largest contribution to",
    "the cosmic variance comes from the small values of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the situation may improve if one subtracts the lower order multipoles contribution , as in the @xmath101 analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in figures 3 a  b ,",
    "we show by a grey band the expected range of values for the three ",
    "point correlation function for the texture model ( as in fig .",
    "2 ) and by a black band the expected range for inflationary models .",
    "the bands do not superpose each other for some ranges of values of the separation angle for the value of @xmath102 considered , what means that measurements in that range can distinguish among the models .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath86 considered is quite large , much in excess of that suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , but we have chosen it to show an example with a noticeable effect . we have checked that the non  superposition of the bands appears for @xmath103 . the comparison with the data is less clear for this case , as the two  year _ cobe _ results have large instrumental noise ( in excess of the gaussian cosmic variance ) for this subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "however , with the four  year data , the instrumental noise is expected to diminish under the cosmic variance , and it would be possible to distinguish among the models , at least for textures with @xmath103 . on the other hand , already from the present data of ref . @xcite for small and very large angles , we can say that models with @xmath104 are quite disfavoured .",
    "an experiment probing smaller angular scales than _ cobe _ should thus be more appropriate to test non  gaussian features in texture models .",
    "as an example we compute the predictions for a three  beam subtraction scheme experiment with window function at zero ",
    "lag @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the beam width and @xmath107 is the chopping angle .",
    "this window function is peaked at @xmath108 and the range of multipoles that significantly contribute to the three ",
    "point function is from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "hence we are still probing large enough scales and our results are not strongly affected by the microphysics of the last scattering surface , as it has recently been shown that the scale for the appearance of the so  called doppler peaks within texture models is shifted to larger @xmath100 s than in the standard adiabatic case and their contribution turns out not to be dominant for this range of @xmath100 s @xcite .",
    "we obtain for the skewness @xmath111 , where the error band stands for the associated cosmic variance @xmath112 , for a value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath96 . for comparison ,",
    "the gaussian adiabatic prediction is @xmath113 .",
    "thus , in this case even for reasonably small values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath86 one such experiment can in principle distinguish between inflation and texture predictions , and thus put stronger constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we used an analytical model of the cmb anisotropies produced by textures to estimate the three  point correlation function and its cosmic variance . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", we expect that it can give a reasonable estimation of the results that would be obtained in numerical simulations .",
    "the idea of this analytical model @xcite is that the texture evolution generates hot and cold spots in the sky at a constant rate per hubble volume and hubble time .",
    "due to the scaling property of textures evolution the typical size of the spots is a constant fraction of the angle subtended by the hubble radius at the time they are produced .",
    "the spot shapes are given by a profile function times a brightness factor .",
    "these free parameters have to be determined from the results of simulations . here",
    "we have fixed the number density of spots produced per hubble volume and hubble time , the angular scale of the spots and the spots profile so that they are consistent with the results of ref .",
    "the computations of the three  point function and the cosmic variance are fundamentally sensitive to the distribution of the spots brightness .",
    "a distribution symmetric in hot and cold spots gives rise to a vanishing three  point function , while a non  symmetric distribution yields a non  vanishing one .",
    "for definiteness , we parameterized the distribution with a very simple ansatz with just two free parameters , namely its dispersion , @xmath83 , and a parameter measuring the asymmetry of the distribution , @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath83 was fixed using the measured amplitude of the two  point correlation function .",
    "@xmath86 instead was left free and encodes the strongest dependence of our results on the model parameters .",
    "as discussed above , numerical simulations for random initial conditions point out to a non  vanishing asymmetry , although with a small value for @xmath86 ( and large error bars ) .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the calculations to another brightness distribution .",
    "the application of this analysis to the _ cobe_dmr experimental setting shows a very large cosmic variance band , much larger than that associated to a gaussian process .",
    "for all reasonable values of @xmath86 , this band encloses both the gaussian one and the cobe data , and thus no conclusions favouring inflationary or texture theories can be obtained .",
    "the predictions of both models are consistent with the three",
    " point function of the _",
    "cobe_dmr maps . on the other hand",
    "when all the multipoles up to @xmath114 are subtracted , the situation looks a bit more promising and we saw that for large values of @xmath115 , with the four years _ cobe _ data we could distinguish among texture and inflationary models . however , these large values of @xmath86 seem to be larger than those expected from simulations . finally , we showed that a experiment probing smaller angular scales should be able to distinguish between both classes of models , even for small values of the modulus of the parameter @xmath86 .",
