    "in general , spectrum - based analysis of time - delay systems can be handled in the same way it is done for delay - free systems .",
    "although the spectrum is infinite , stability is determined by the rightmost eigenvalues , more precisely by the sign of the spectral abscissa , the maximum real part of the eigenvalues . for retarded systems ,",
    "the spectral abscissa is nonsmooth but continuous in all parameters of the system , including time delays , see @xcite .",
    "however , it results from @xcite , that , in general , it is not the case for neutral systems and kernel operators - the so - called associated difference equation , see also @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the spectral abscissa of the difference equation is not continuous in delays .",
    "thus , arbitrarily small changes in the delay values can destroy stability .",
    "moreover , it can even happen that the number of unstable roots increases stepwise from zero to infinity . in order to handle this hypersensitivity of the stability of the difference equation with respect to delay values ,",
    "the concept of _ strong stability _ was introduced by @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the _ strong stability _ concept has recently been generalized by @xcite towar d difference equations with dependencies in the delays",
    ".    as stability of its kernel operator is a necessary condition for stability of a neutral system , all the hypersensitivity stability issues are carried over to the stability of neutral systems .",
    "thus the _ strong stability _",
    "test should always be performed to guarantee practical stability of neutral systems . however , as will be shown later in the text , the _ strong stability _",
    "test is rather complex .",
    "so far , a coarse numerical implementation of the test without guarantee or certificate has been used as a rule , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "even though this _ brute force _ based approach works in most cases , it might fail due to approximation errors in the numerical scheme .",
    "as the main result of this paper we propose a more rigorous _",
    "strong stability test _ that is based on a polynomial approach , relying on the numerical solution of a hierarchy of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) .    in the field of time - delay systems ,",
    "lmis are usually used as stability determining criteria resulting from the lyapunov time - domain approach , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite , among many others .",
    "we consider a neutral system of the following form    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the state , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the time delays .",
    "it is well - known , see @xcite , that a necessary condition for stability of neutral system ( [ sys ] ) is stability of the associated difference equation    @xmath4    moreover , _ strong stability _ of equation ( [ difeq ] ) is required , i.e. stability independent of the values of the delays , @xcite . in @xcite ( theorem 2.2 and corollary 2.2 ) , a condition for strong stability condition is stated as follows :    [ propstrong ] delay difference equation ( [ difeq ] ) is strongly stable if and only if    @xmath5^{m}}\\ r_{\\sigma}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^m h_k e^{-i\\theta_k}\\right)<1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 denotes the spectral radius , i.e. the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath7 then equation ( [ difeq ] ) is exponentially unstable for rationally independent numbers @xmath8 are rationally independent if and only if @xmath9 implies @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , two delays @xmath11 and @xmath12 are rationally independent if their ratio is an irrational number . ]",
    "delays .",
    "notice that the quantity @xmath13 does not depend on the value of the delays , i.e. exponential stability locally in the delays is equivalent with exponential stability globally in the delays @xcite .",
    "let us remark that by homogeneity , the expression of @xmath13 can be simplified to @xmath14^{m-1}}\\ r_{\\sigma}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m-1 } h_k e^{-i\\theta_k}+h_m\\right).\\ ] ]    we conclude the section with some properties of the quantity @xmath13 , see @xcite , for more details .    * properties *    1 .",
    "stability of difference equation ( [ difeq ] ) with rationally independent delays implies strong stability , and vice versa 2 .",
    "in the case of one delay ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 3 .   in the case of a scalar equation ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 4 .   a sufficient , but as a rule conservative , condition for strong stability is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the matrix euclidean norm , i.e. the maximum singular value .",
    "the problem of solving ( [ gamma0 ] ) can be formulated as an optimization task with the objective to find the global maximum of spectral radius over @xmath21^{m}$ ] .",
    "however , in general the objective function @xmath22 is nonconvex , i.e. it can have multiple local maxima .",
    "besides , the function can be nonsmooth ( e.g. at the points where the spectral radius is determined by more than either one single eigenvalue or a couple of complex conjugate eigenvalues ) .",
    "the fact that the function is nonsmooth precludes the use of standard optimization procedures .",
    "instead , nonsmooth optimization methods can be used , such as gradient sampling , see @xcite .",
    "however , even though these methods can handle the problem of nonsmoothness , they converge to local extrema as a rule . as suboptimal solutions are not sufficient",
    "( the global maximum of the spectral radius is needed ) a brute force method has been used to solve the task so far , see @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "each dimension of @xmath23^{m}$ ] is discretized to @xmath24 points",
    ". then evaluation of ( [ gamma0 ] ) consists in solving @xmath25 times @xmath26 eigenvalue problems .",
    "hence , the overall cost of one evaluation of @xmath13 is @xmath27 , see @xcite . if the simplified expression ( [ gamma0simp ] ) , the computational costs reduces to @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the complexity of the computation grows considerably with the number of delays in the difference equation .",
    "moreover , the risk of missing global extrema due to sparse or inappropriate gridding can not be avoided .",
    "consider the characteristic polynomial @xmath29 which is homogeneous of degree @xmath30 in @xmath31 variables @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    "it has all its roots in the open unit disk .    in order to deal with stability of this polynomial",
    ", we use a stability criterion based on the hermite matrix .",
    "it is a hermitian matrix of dimension @xmath30 whose entries are quadratic in the coefficients of the polynomial .",
    "the hermite matrix @xmath36 is therefore a trigonometric polynomial matrix in @xmath37 variables @xmath38 .",
    "derived by the french mathematician charles hermite in 1854 , the hermite matrix criterion is a symmetric version of the routh - hurwitz criterion for assessing stability of a polynomial .",
    "it says that a polynomial @xmath39 has all its roots in the open upper half of the complex plane if and only if its hermite matrix @xmath40 is positive definite .",
    "note that @xmath40 is @xmath30-by-@xmath30 , hermitian and quadratic in coefficients @xmath41 , so that the above necessary and sufficient stability condition is a quadratic matrix inequality ( qmi ) in coefficient vector @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the standard construction of the hermite matrix goes through the notion of bzoutian , a particular form of the resultant .",
    "a bivariate polynomial is constructed , from which a quadratic term is factored out , yielding a quadratic form shaped by the hermite matrix . the construction is explained e.g. in @xcite and references therein .",
    "see especially @xcite which explains that a discrete - time hermite matrix , sometimes called schur - cohn or schur - fujiwara matrix , can be obtained similarly .",
    "the discrete - time hermite matrix is also quadratic in the @xmath41 , and it is positive definite if and only if polynomial @xmath43 has all its roots in the open unit disk .",
    "zdenk hurk pointed out that there is a much simpler construction of the hermite matrix in the discrete - time case .",
    "the construction can be traced back to issai schur @xcite , and it is explained in @xcite .",
    "entrywise formulas are also described in ( * ? ? ?",

    "then @xmath45    strong stability of the difference equation is hence equivalent to positive definiteness of the hermite matrix of the univariate characteristic polynomial , which is a multivariate trigonometric polynomial matrix in @xmath38 .",
    "we express this constraint as @xmath46",
    "as shown in the previous section , the key ingredient in our approach to strong stability of difference equation is assessing positivity of multivariate trigonometric polynomials .",
    "this topic has been subject to recent studies , and the recent monograph @xcite is a good introduction focusing on signal processing applications .    in this section",

    "as soon as @xmath68 is fixed , finding a matrix @xmath77 satisfying ( [ sos ] ) can be cast into an sdp feasibility problem which amounts to expressing polynomial @xmath60 as a sum - of - squares ( sos ) of trigonometric polynomials of degree @xmath68 .    now defining @xmath78",
