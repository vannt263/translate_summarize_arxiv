    "since the work of cavalcanti @xcite , the casimir effect of the piston geometry ( see fig .",

    "some studies have been devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "it was found that for massless scalar field with periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , dirichlet b.c .  and neumann b.c . , and for electromagnetic field with perfect electric conductor ( pec ) b.c .  and perfect magnetic conductor ( pmc ) b.c . in a @xmath0-dimensional space",
    ", the casimir force acting on the piston always tends to pull the piston to the closest wall .",
    "this might create undesirable effect known as stiction in the functionality of nano devices . in @xcite , barton showed that for a thin piston with weakly reflecting dielectrics , the casimir force at small separations is attractive , but turn to repulsive as the separation increases .",
    "another scenario which brings to repulsive casimir force was considered in @xcite , where a massless or massive scalar field is assumed to satisfy neumann b.c .  on the piston and dirichlet b.c . on all other walls . in this case , the zero temperature casimir force was shown to be always repulsive . in @xcite , it was suggested that a perfectly conducting piston inside a rectangular cavity with infinitely permeable walls will lead to repulsive casimir force .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the thermal correction to the repulsive casimir force due to electromagnetic field with mixed boundary conditions ( pec b.c .  on one wall and pmc b.c .",
    "on the opposite wall ) and determine whether temperature will change the nature of the force .",

    "the finite temperature casimir effect was recently considered in @xcite .",
    "it was found that for pure boundary conditions , the casimir force is always attractive at any temperature",
    ". therefore it will be interesting to see whether the thermal correction affects the repulsive nature of the casimir force due to electromagnetic field with mixed b.c .",
    "this is the issue addressed in this paper .",
    "we consider more general case of mixed b.c .  where each pair of parallel plates can either assume pure boundary conditions ( both pec b.c .  or both pmc b.c . ) or mixed boundary conditions .",

    "the sum corresponding to the temperature correction @xmath7 is a convergent sum .",

    "however , it can be shown as in @xcite that in the piston scenario , the divergence terms of the casimir force acting on the piston due to region i and region ii always cancel without renormalization due to the fact that the divergence terms of the casimir energies are linear in @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] respectively . here",
    "we would like to remark that by restoring the units @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , we have to replace @xmath93 in the expressions for casimir force with @xmath141 .",
