    "the skyrmion ( skm ) is a topologically - protected spin texture , with promising spintronic applications@xcite .",
    "since the first experimental report identified the skm crystal structure in chiral magnets ( cms ) , various materials hosting the skm are found or fabricated with different skm - generating mechanisms@xcite .",
    "multiple skms can form into two - dimensional hexagonal , triangular , or square crystal structures , which are similar to superfluid whirls forming vortex lattices in type ii superconductors@xcite .",
    "the topological property of a spin texture can be described by the surface integral of the solid angle of the unitary spin - field vector @xmath0 defined by the skm number as @xmath1 . by using the symmetry of the skm",
    ", one can write the spin field of the skm in a general form of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the total skm number can be obtained as@xcite @xmath3_{r = \\infty } ^{r = 0}\\left [ { \\phi \\left ( \\varphi   \\right ) } \\right]_{\\varphi   = 0}^{\\varphi   = 2\\pi } .   \\label{skm number}\\ ] ] while the center spin points upward and the edge spin points downward , or vice versa , different whirling patterns can be determined by a phase factor @xmath4 with @xmath5 different skm structures correspond to different vorticity such as @xmath6 and different helicity such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the multiple variants of the skm are not discovered or artificially formed yet . in this papers",
    ", we will show several results that generating different skyrmion structures under special magnetic boundaries .    as the skm can not be continuously deformed into a homogeneous magnetic state or vice versa , the current - induced skm dynamics , which imbue nontrivial topology into or drain nontrivial topology from the original magnetic states draw a great attention@xcite .",
    "it is predicted by simulation that the skm can be generated from the topologically - trivial state such as a ferromagnet and a helimagnet by external lorentzian and radial spin currents@xcite .",
    "the experimentally - realized skm generation by the current flowing from the scanning tunneling microscope can be interpreted by the spin current extending radially from the tip point@xcite .",
    "besides spin currents , topology of the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields and constriction geometry can also generate or tailor the skm out of topologically - trivial magnetic states@xcite .",
    "although the skm can not be generated by continuous variation from the topologically - trivial state , it is predicted that transformation is possible between different topologically - nontrivial states such as that between the domain - wall pair and the skm@xcite .",
    "these previous findings hint to us that topology can be seen as a tailorable property .",
    "direct transformation between spin textures with trivial and nontrivial topologies is forbidden .",
    "however , nontrivial topology from spin currents and domain - wall pairs can be transformed into the topological pattern of the skm . and",
    "in this work , we will show that the nontrivial boundary topology can also be used to tailor the skm spin texture .",
    "the spin dynamics in the cms can be described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) nonlinear evolution equation including the effects of the ferromagnetic exchange , the external magnetic field , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , the gilbert damping , and the adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin torques@xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction is the origin of symmetric magnetism , with adjacent spins tending to align parallel to each other in order to decrease the exchange energy .",
    "the dm interaction in non - centrosymmetric magnets competes with the heisenberg interaction and induces the spiral spin texture , while a perpendicular external magnetic field stabilizes the skyrmion state with an integer topological number@xcite . together with theoretical simulations the artificial generation of the skm",
    "have been realized in the cm and magnetic thin films by different physical mechanisms@xcite .",
    "however , we think that there remain two important issues less considered : 1 .",
    "present proposals require direct electric or magnetic interactions with the sample , which complicates its maintenance and possible variations ; 2 .",
    "previous focus lies in whether - or - not a skm is generated and differences among the many skm variants are less heeded . in this work , we present a way of artificially controlling the generation of different skm variants by modulating the boundary magnetic configurations .",
    "the multiple skm variants bear different topological properties and have promising applications in spintronic logical gates . also , in this way direct interaction with the sample is avoided .",
    "our research is motivated by the recent paper about the current - induced skm dynamics in constricted geometries , in which the geometrical constriction plays an important role in forming topological nontrivial surroundings@xcite .",
    "we extend the subtle spatial geometry into a subtle magnetic geometry and propose the present scheme tailoring the topological details of the skm vortex .",
    "we have fabricated a two - dimensional square - lattice cm confined by patterned ferromagnetic boundaries and numerically solved the llg equation to obtain the final stable skm state .",
    "we firstly put the cm in the nonequilibrium ferromagnetic or helimagnetic state by a relatively high temperature or large magnetic fields .",
    "then we fix the boundary ferromagnetism pattern by external magnetic fields outside of the considered cm sample and decrease the temperature or the inside magnetic field and simulate the evolution of the spin states .",
    "the proposed scheme is shown in fig",
    "we consider the spin dynamics of a thin slab of the cm , assuming translation symmetry along the thickness direction .",
    "the ground state is determined by the antisymmetric dm interaction , which results in the helical spin texture and can be described by the hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath9 the local magnetic moment @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the local spin at @xmath13 ) .",
    "it can be treated as classical vectors whose length is fixed as @xmath14 . therefore @xmath15 with @xmath16 the unitary spin field vector . @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 correspond to the ferromagnetic and dm exchange energies , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the strength of the external magnetic field contributing to the zeeman term . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the unitary vectors in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions within the cm slab plane , respectively .",
    "the magnetic dynamics of the considered model can be described by the llg equation@xcite , @xmath24 which is formulated in the continuum approximation .",
    "where @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath25 represents the effective field defined by @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the gilbert damping parameter@xcite .",
    "we choose the unit of time @xmath28 .",
    "the evolution of the spin field is solved by the forth runge - kutta method .",
    "numerical results of the simulation under different boundary and initial conditions are given in this section .",
    "the final states shown in fig . 2 correspond to the ferromagnetic boundaries with the spin pointing upward or downward perpendicular to the cm slab .",
    "we adopt a square lattice of size @xmath29 in the unit of the lattice constant throughout the simulation .",
    "we set the initial state of the cm to be a helimagnet with spiraling spin field @xmath30 $ ] in the cartesian coordinate with @xmath31 to sustain a complete spiral within the slab .",
    "we found that the value of @xmath32 slightly affects the evolution process of the spin state and the time needed to achieve the final state without altering the stabilized state under the fixed boundary magnetism .",
    "the typical dm interaction @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 are used .",
    "the @xmath37-component magnetic field is within the range of the skm phase under other parameter settings in a cm@xcite . without a noticeable error accumulation",
    ", we found the helical state collapsed rapidly as a result of reflection by fixed boundary .",
    "the spins adjacent to the boundary are forced to follow the direction of the spins of the boundary , which is fixed by external magnetic fields outside of the cm slab .",
    "then the influence of the boundary arrives at the center of the cm in a relay and fluctuating process until an isolated skm or anti - skm is created , whose skm number is very closed to 1 or -1 .",
    "it can be seen that the skm in ( a ) whirls counterclockwisely corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the anti - skm in ( b ) whirls counterclockwisely corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the whirling pattern is determined by the direction of the dm interaction . when @xmath42 , the @xmath43 state is always a counterclockwise vortex and vice versa .",
    "these two states are already confirmed by experiment .    to show that the obtained skm state is stabilized by the external magnetic field , variation of the skm number in time",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "as the initial state and other parameters are the same , we attribute the topological type of the skm generated to the applied ferromagnetic boundary condition .",
    "the ferromagnetic boundary can break the original trivial topology .",
    "nontrivial topology emerges as the spins scatter with the boundary fixed spins .",
    "however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "1 that the boundary is tailored into a hard circle topologically nontrivially . it can also be seen in fig .",
    "3 that even when the center region is a helimagnet or a ferromagnet in the initial state of @xmath44 , the boundary contribute a finite chern number although it is not an integer .",
    "this is also the case in the domain - wall pair reversibly transforming into a skm@xcite .",
    "the nontrivial topology with partial chern number is not stable and evolves into a full skm in a short period of back - and - forth interactions among spins , which can be observed in the evolution of @xmath45 . as the strength of the dm interaction @xmath33",
    "is used , the diameter of the naturally - host skm in a cm is @xmath46 in the unit of @xmath47 , which strengthens the skm and anti - skm obtained with the same radius of @xmath48 .    besides the usual skm and anti - skm spin profiles ,",
    "our simulations show that some variants of the skm with the vorticity and helicity defined by special @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ topological details ] ) , which exactly match the spin profile proposed by nagaosa and tokura@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we firstly apply a strong magnetic field to form a ferromagnetic initial state with the local magnetic moments pointing in the @xmath37-direction as shown in fig .",
    "then we abruptly turn down the magnetic field to @xmath36 and take the ferromagnetic state as the initial state and turn on the boundary magnetic fields to induce the ferromagnetic boundaries and tailor the topological details of the skm state .",
    "one kind of the boundary condition used with the boundary spins lying in - plane and winding counterclockwisely corresponding to the final state of fig .",
    "4 ( d ) is shown in fig .",
    "the other types of ferromagnetic boundaries we considered are that the boundary spins all lie in - plane pointing out of the center , toward the center , and winding clockwisely corresponding to the final state fig .",
    "4(a ) ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "for all the four cases @xmath49 , which is smaller than the cases shown in fig .",
    "this is because that the boundary - determined final state is a skm with @xmath50 .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ skm number ] ) that when the spin at the edge of the skm lies in - plane instead of pointing upward or downward , @xmath51 , contributing a @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ topological details ] ) .",
    "we can call the state a half skm . as the spiraling period in the cm",
    "is determined by @xmath53 , in the considered case , the radius of the full skm extends much farther than the @xmath54 edge giving rise to much longer spiraling period .",
    "therefore , only a much smaller @xmath53 can sustain the longer spiraling period . in real materials",
    ", @xmath53 varies between a large range , which promises the workability of our proposition . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , under the interference of the robust boundary , the initial ferromagnetic states have broken their original topological structures evolved in to the half - skm state with @xmath45 close to @xmath55 . the spins adjacent to the boundary",
    "adiabatically follow the fixed boundary direction and conduct its effect by the heisenberg and dm interactions in a relay pattern generating a vortex spin structure . using the boundary magnetic fields the topological details of the skm structure are precisely tailored .",
    "the stable half - skm states are obtained with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath8 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively shown in fog .",
    "4 ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "the value of @xmath60 can be controlled by artificial ferromagnetic boundaries subject to magnetic manipulation .",
    "again , to confirm the nonequilibrium stableness of the half - skm obtained , the time evolution of the skm number is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen from the skm number that the evolution of the four kinds of spin states are quite similar . without the ferromagnetic boundary ,",
    "the spins were supposed to form an anti - vortex with negative skm number under the emergent electromagnetic field . when subject to the fixed boundary , the spins receive a great influence and rapidly swing into a vortex , hinting that the artificial effect of the external magnetic boundaries is strong .",
    "the topological details of different spin structures can be tailored in this way .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the spin dynamics in the cm confined by different types of ferromagnetic boundaries .",
    "particularly , by applying the ferromagnetic boundaries with the boundary spins pointing downward ; upward ; out of the center ; toward the center ; winding clockwisely ; and counterclockwisely , we have obtained the skm , anti - skm , and half - skm spin vortex structures with the vorticity and helicity @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath61 ; @xmath59 .",
