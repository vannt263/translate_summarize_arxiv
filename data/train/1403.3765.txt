    "the multiple sum @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are complex variables , was introduced independently by hoffman @xcite and zagier @xcite , and has been studied extensively in recent decades .",
    "mathematicians were first interested in special values of at positive integer points .",
    "then around 2000 , the meromorphic continuation of to the whole space @xmath5 was established , and mathematicians started to consider analytic properties of .",
    "the case @xmath6 of , that is @xmath7 was first studied already by euler .",
    "therefore is sometimes called the euler double sum , or the euler double zeta - function .",
    "since this is the simplest case , it is natural to begin analytic studies with .",
    "the series is absolutely convergent in the region @xmath8 and can be continued meromorphically to the whole space @xmath9 .",
    "the order estimate of @xmath10 outside the region was discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "various mean values of @xmath10 has recently been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problem of studying the distribution of zeros of ( or more generally , ) was first proposed by zhao @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 of is nothing but the classical riemann zeta - function @xmath12 . for the riemann zeta - function",
    "there is the famous riemann hypothesis , which predicts that all non - trivial zeros ( that is , zeros except those on the negative real axis ) lie on the line @xmath13 . in the case of @xmath0 , however , the analogue of the riemann hypothesis does not hold .",
    "in fact , consider the case @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 denotes the number of zeros of @xmath16 ( counted with multiplicity ) in the rectangle @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "then it is shown in a recent preprint of nakamura and pankowski @xcite that for any @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 , it holds that @xmath24 where @xmath25 are constants with @xmath26 .",
    "the reason of this difference lies , probably , on the fact that @xmath12 has the euler product expansion while @xmath0 does not have .",
    "this is because the additive structure @xmath27 in the denominator on the right - hand side of breaks multiplicative structure .",
    "this observation suggests that the behaviour of zeros of @xmath0 may resemble the behaviour of zeros of not @xmath12 , but hurwitz zeta - functions @xmath28 because @xmath29 also includes an additive structure in its denominator .",
    "in fact , the result analogous to is known for hurwitz zeta - functions ; let @xmath30 denotes the number of zeros of @xmath29 in the rectangle as above .",
    "then , at least when @xmath31 is a rational number ( @xmath32 ) ( due to voronin ) or a transcendental number ( due to gonek ) , it holds that @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( see theorems 4.7 , 4.8 and 4.10 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) ) .",
    "the purpose of the present series of papers is to study the behaviour of zeros of @xmath0 from the viewpoint of numerical computations . in the present paper , as the first step , we will study the case @xmath35 , and especially we will show that the behaviour of zeros of @xmath16 is indeed similar to the behaviour of zeros of hurwitz zeta - functions in some sense .",
    "in this and the next section we describe the results on the distribution of zeros of @xmath16 . in this case ,",
    "the simplest way of computations is to use the harmonic product formula @xmath36 putting @xmath14 in , we obtain @xmath37 and hence all computations can be done just by using _",
    "mathematica 9.0.1.0 _ , in which the package for the computations of the values of @xmath12 is equipped .",
    "however in a forthcoming paper we will study more general situation , when the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are different . as a preparation to such a study , in the present paper we will also develop another method , which can be applied to the general case .    here",
    "we explain the theoretical background of our second method .",
    "the basic formula which we use in our computations is the following form of the euler - maclaurin summation formula : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42th bernoulli number defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 it is not difficult to see that @xmath46 is actually the usual remainder term of the euler - maclaurin formula : @xmath47)x^{-s-2k-1}dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 ( if @xmath49 is even ) or @xmath50 ( if @xmath49 is odd ) , @xmath51 $ ] is the fractional part of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the @xmath42th bernoulli polynomial .",
