    "the top quark is the heaviest standard model ( sm ) particle which has been discovered so far , and might be the first place in which new physics effects could appear .",
    "while the top quark has been discovered and studied in some details at the tevatron , many of its properties are being studied at the lhc with high precision .",
    "since new physics can show up in the couplings of the top quark with other sm particles , in particular gauge bosons , the precise measurement of the top couplings among the top quark and gauge bosons is important . in particular ,",
    "the top quark is copiously produced at the lhc , the lhc experiments are the places to probe these couplings@xcite .    at the lhc ,",
    "top quarks are produced primarily via two independent mechanisms .",
    "the dominant production mechanism is the pair production processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and second is single top production via electroweak interactions involving the @xmath3 vertex .",
    "single top quarks at the lhc are produced in three different modes : the s - channel ( the involved @xmath4 is time - like ) , the t - channel mode ( the involved @xmath4 is space - like ) , and the @xmath0 production ( the @xmath4 boson is real ) . despite single top",
    "has a smaller cross section than top pair production , it can play an important role in top quark physics at lhc because this channel has potential to allow a direct measurement of @xmath5 ckm matrix elements as well as its sensitivity to various new physics models .",
    "however sufficient integrated luminosity and improved method of analysis can help us achieve detection of single top events at the lhc .",
    "the first observable in single top study is the total cross section and measurement of any possible deviation from predicted value by the sm .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of physics beyond sm on single top quark production .    as it is well - known sm has been successfully predicted experimental measurements with a great precision .",
    "nevertheless , it is commonly accepted that it is a valid effective lagrangian which is applicable at low energies . in many beyond",
    "sm theories which have been studied to date , reduction to the sm at low energies proceeds via decoupling of heavy particle with masses of order @xmath6 .",
    "there have been many attempts to study the sensitivity of the lhc observables to various effective operators @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study the effect of anomalous couplings of the top quark with gluon via @xmath0-channel of single top at the lhc .",
    "we will assume that new physics effects in @xmath0 single top production are induced by consideration of an effective lagrangian .",
    "here , we confine our studies to interaction of mass dimension @xmath7 after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the total statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurement of cross section for this process at the lhc is about @xmath8 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest quark , therefore effect of new physics on its coupling are expected to be larger than for any other fermions and deviation with respect to the sm predictions might be detectable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , including the effective lagrangian for @xmath10 coupling , we calculate the analytical expression for the single @xmath0 top cross section production at the lhc . in section  3 , we present the dependency of observables which we study at the lhc . then , we find the allowed regions in parameters space of our effective lagrangian and compare our results with the results obtained from observables in production of @xmath11 at lhc and edm of top quark .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we introduce a model independent effective lagrangian for the vertex of @xmath10 and look for any possible deviation from sm prediction in production of @xmath12-channel at the lhc . in this approach",
    ", we assume that sm modified by an addition 5-dimensional lagrangian which include interaction of top pair and gluon and consider the effect of this lagrangian in production of @xmath0 single top production .",
    "coefficients of this lagrangian parameterize the low energy effects of the underlying high scale physics .",
    "as it is well - known , the gauge invariant effective lagrangian for the interactions between the top quark and gluons which include the cedm and cmdm form factors is given by : @xmath13 t g^{a}_{\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the @xmath15 color matrices and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the cmdm and cedm forms factors of the top quark .",
    "notice that a sizable non - zero cedm would be the signal of a new type of cp - violating interaction beyond ckm phase and can contribute to electric dipole moment ( edm ) of neutron .",
    "for this reason , experimental upper bound on edm of neutron constraint this coupling @xcite,@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use this constraint on parameters space of above lagrangian and compare these bounds with our result which arise from @xmath12 single top production at lhc .",
    "assuming @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is the scale of new physics , the form factors can be approximated by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent of @xmath22 .",
