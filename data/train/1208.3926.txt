    "when a quantum system is slowly and periodically modulated by two or more control parameters such as gate voltages , a net number of particles can be transported per period of the modulation even in the absence of dc driving force ( e.g. , bias voltage ) .",
    "this phenomenon is known as an adiabatic pumping .",
    "the adiabatic pumping has received much attention because of its possibilities for quantized charge transport @xcite , spin pumping @xcite , and qubit manipulation @xcite , which are difficult to achieve in conventional stationary transport .",
    "the original idea of the adiabatic pumping was proposed by thouless @xcite , where a pumped current of a closed quantum system is related to the berry phase @xcite of the ground state of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "since then , the idea of the adiabatic pumping has been applied to mesoscopic quantum systems .",
    "experimentally , the pumping in coulomb blockade regime @xcite and in open quantum systems @xcite has been developed .",
    "theoretically , the formulation based on the time - dependent scattering theory @xcite has been established .",
    "@xcite . according to this formulation , the average pumped current can be expressed by the berry phase associated with the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "the cumulant generating function of pumped current can also be described by geometrical quantities @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the adiabatic pumping is referred to as the geometrical pumping .",
    "this scattering matrix approach is applicable to systems where the interaction can be neglected or treated in the mean field level .",
    "a recent theoretical interest in this field is to understand the effects of interaction in the system on the adiabatic pumping @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena have been studied in stochastic systems described by classical master equation @xcite , which is referred to as the adiabatic stochastic pumping .",
    "the pumped current in the classical stochastic pumping has also geometrical properties ; the cumulant generating function of the pumped current is expressed by a berry - phase - like quantity that is associated with the generator of the classical master equation .",
    "we shall refer to this quantity as the berry - sinitsyn - nemenman ( bsn ) phase @xcite .",
    "there have also been several works on the adiabatic pumping for quantum open systems described by quantum master equation ( qme ) @xcite .",
    "although the results for pumped charge or spin in specific models were provided in those works , the geometrical formulae for the adiabatic pumping described by qme have not been discussed so far .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the quantum adiabatic pumping on the basis of qme , and derive general formulae of the cumulant generating function and average of the pumped quantity .",
    "these formulae are geometrical and expressed by a quantum analogous of the bsn phase which is associated with the generator of the qme . in qme approach",
    ", we can treat interaction between particles beyond the mean field level in any of perturbative , non - perturbative , or exact methods , depending on the model and analysis .",
    "in any methods , we can apply these formulae as long as we employ the qme , since our theoretical framework is independent of the details of the system .",
    "therefore these are useful for analyzing a variety of applications of the adiabatic pumping such as a qubit rotation in quantum dots @xcite and a spin pumping @xcite .",

    "[ sec : generalresults ]  c. in this formulation , the temperatures and chemical potentials of reservoirs are parts of the control parameters .",

    "fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( a)-(c ) , we plot the bsn curvature @xmath211 for various values of the interaction strength @xmath197 obtained from the numerical diagonalization method without the rwa .",
    "we find that there exist two positive and two negative peaks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( d ) , we plot the position of one of the positive peaks and that of one of the negative peaks . we see that the positions of the negative peaks move as @xmath197 increases , whereas those of the positive ones do not .",
    "moreover we find that these peak positions are located around at the energies necessary to add one electron ; the positions of the positive peaks are @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and those of the negative ones are @xmath214 and @xmath215 , where the mode energies are given by @xmath216 ( the subscripts @xmath217 and @xmath218 stand for the anti - bonding and bonding modes , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that the positive and negative peaks merge for non - interacting system ( @xmath219 ) , and thus the curvature @xmath211 becomes zero in @xmath220-space to achieve the no - pumping condition mentioned below eq .",
    "( [ curvaturerwa ] ) .",
    "this result also implies that , for @xmath221 , an adiabatic pumping can occur even if only the reservoir parameters are modulated .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( e ) shows the @xmath197-dependence of the excess electron transfer @xmath186 for cyclic processes [ cycle  1 and 2 depicted in fig .",

    "we observe that @xmath186 for the cycle  1 becomes a constant for @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , @xmath186 for the cycle  2 has a peak at @xmath223 $ ] and becomes nearly zero for @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "these results are consistent with the behaviors of the peak positions of the bsn curvature @xmath211 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( a)-(c ) and ( d ) : as @xmath197 increases , the positive peak positions of @xmath211 stay around the location of the cycle  1 whereas the negative peak positions of @xmath211 pass across the location of the cycle  2 .",
    "qualitatively , these results are understood as follows .",
    "the pumped current resonantly flows when the chemical potential of the reservoirs agrees with the energy necessary to add ( or remove ) one electron @xcite . in the present model ,",
    "these energies are @xmath207 for the transition @xmath224 , @xmath206 for @xmath225 , @xmath205 for @xmath226 , and @xmath204 for @xmath227 . here",
    "@xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 are the eigenstates of @xmath3 ( the empty , anti - bonding , bonding , and doubly occupied states , respectively ) .",
    "the transitions @xmath224 and @xmath226 ( or @xmath225 and @xmath227 ) have opossitely directed contribution to the pumping . for @xmath219 , since these two resonant points locate at the same position , the contribution from these two cancels out .",
    "the inter - dot interaction breaks this degeneracy of the resonant points ; for @xmath232 , the locations of the resonant points separate and thus non - zero pumped current can flow . the non - monotonic behavior for the cycle  2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( e ) can be also understood as follows . in the smaller @xmath197 region , the resonant points come into the cycle  2 as @xmath197 increases , which results in the increase of @xmath186 in this region . in the larger @xmath197 region , on the other hand , the resonant points go out of the cycle  2 as @xmath197 increases , which results in the decrease of @xmath186 in this region .",
    "by using a qme approach , we have derived a geometrical expressions of the cumulant generating function and average of the pumped ( excess ) quantity transferred from reservoirs to the system under slow modulation of control parameters , where the bsn phases , vector potential , and the curvature of the qme play crucial roles .    for non - interacting electrons in quantum dot systems ,",
    "there is no pumped current when only the temperatures and chemical potentials of the reservoirs are modulated .",
    "in contrast , for an interacting system , the pumped current can be observed even in this situation .",
    "we note that the modulations of only the chemical potentials of the reservoirs are required for the pumping ( in the interacting system ) .",
    "this has an advantage for the control of the pumping in experiments , since the modulation of chemical potential is easier than that of the temperatures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdinteraction ]  ( e ) , for a cyclic modulation of the chemical potentials , the pumped current depends not only on the difference of the chemical potentials but also on their average .",
    "this implies that the average number of electrons in the system s is important for the pumping .",
    "for example , when we modulate the chemical potentials as @xmath233 and @xmath234 , @xmath235 affects the quantity of the pumping .",
    "this fact may be applicable for switching the pumping by the change of @xmath235 or the electron density , which can be controlled by a gate voltage .",
    "since we have employed the method of the full counting statistics , we can also calculate the fluctuation ( noise ) of the pumped quantity .",
    "it is a future issue to analyse the detailed properties of the fluctuation in the adiabatic pumping .",
    "although we have applied our formulation only to the examples of spinless systems in this paper , we can apply it also to the qme description of spin pumping @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the relation between the present geometrical expression of the adiabatic pumping based on the qme and the conventional geometrical expressions based on the scattering theory @xcite , and to clarify the condition for quantized charge pumping ( topological effect ) as in the case of the classical master equation @xcite .",
    "the investigations of non - adiabatic pumping , non - markovian situation , and spin effect are also future issues . for example",
    ", it is important to consider the electron system with spin in a single dot with the on - site hubbard hamiltonian ( anderson model ) @xcite , and to compare with our results of spinless case @xcite .",
