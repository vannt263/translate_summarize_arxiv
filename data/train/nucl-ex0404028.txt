    "both radiative strength functions @xmath6 of @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions and density @xmath7 of levels populated by them are determined by inner nuclear processes at corresponding excitation energy . below the neutron binding energy @xmath8 , the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , in practice , the only probe for nuclear models .",
    "therefore , determination of these parameters with the maximum possible reliability is one of the principle tasks of low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "very high level density of deformed , first of all , nuclei and a number of quanta following @xmath0-decay do not allow one to determine mentioned parameters by the direct methods of nuclear spectroscopy above @xmath9 mev . the only possibility to solve this task is the selection of probable values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which allow one to reproduce experimental spectra within the experimental errors and uncertainties of the used model notions .",
    "the main source of systematic errors of such procedure is the strong correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this results from the fact that the intensity of the primary production of the reaction is determined by a product of the probability of emission of reaction product ( including @xmath0-quanta ) and @xmath7 .    this causes a necessity to develop new experimental methods in which the observables are connected by the mathematics relations of other type .",
    "the method [ 1 ] developed at the flnp jinr for simultaneous model - free estimation of the radiative strength functions @xmath6 and density of levels @xmath7 by means of intensities @xmath10 of populating them cascades which follow thermal neutron capture .",
    "these intensities are determined by energy dependence of @xmath6 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions and , qualitatively , are inversely proportional to @xmath7 . as a consequence ,",
    "the interval of @xmath6 and @xmath7 values allowing reproduction of the experimental value of @xmath10 is narrow .",
    "this can promote identification of false values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 determined [ 2 ] from the nucleon evaporation spectra or spectra of primary @xmath0-transitions [ 3 ] .",
    "of course , the data obtained according to [ 1 ] contain some statistic uncertainty caused by inadequacy of the model ideas of of the @xmath0-decay process to the experiment and error in the experimental data used for determination of @xmath10 .",
    "the sum intensities of the cascades whose intermediate levels are lying in the excitation energy interval @xmath11 are calculated under assumptions :    ( a )  the branching ratios for the decaying level @xmath12 do not depend on the mode of its population ;    ( b )  at a given excitation energy , only the levels belonging to solely statistical ensemble exist .",
    "i.e. , the mean reduced probability of their population by the primary @xmath2 or @xmath3 transitions is equal for any level in the spin window set by the selection rule and does not depend on the structure of the wave function the neutron resonance . on the basis of the mathematics theorem of the mean , any sum of partial widths is represented in calculation ( like that used in [ 1 ] ) by the product of their number and some mean partial width ( which is determined through corresponding strength function ) ;    ( c )  the energy dependence of @xmath6 ( but not its absolute value ) is equal for the primary and secondary cascade transitions",
    ".    one can suppose that the maximal discrepancy between the model notions and experiment is conditioned by assumptions ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the truth of the assumption ( c ) now can be tested in direct experiment , but possibility to test thesis ( b ) is quite hypothetical .    in particular , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 values obtained according to [ 1 ] allow good reproduction of intensity distribution of cascades to the final levels with @xmath13 mev and total experimental absolute intensities to the final levels with @xmath14 mev excitation energy ( without additional fit ) in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 nuclei .",
    "somewhat different situation is observed in @xmath17 where analogous data allow possibility of some violation of condition ( c ) .",
    "potentially , possibility of violation of condition ( b ) follows from qualitative interpretation of the results obtained in [ 1 ] .",
    "change in the power of energy dependence in vicinity of @xmath18 allows an assumption about the corresponding change in properties of levels excited by cascades in this region .",
    "if this change is spread over the excitation energy then violation of condition ( b ) in the vicinity of @xmath18 can be significant . although it should be noted that the approximation [ 4 ] of the experimental cumulative sums of cascade intensities shows that this distribution above @xmath19 is well reproduced by the sum of only two distributions which correspond to primary @xmath2 and @xmath3 cascade transitions , respectively .      in modern experiment",
    "[ 5 ] the error of cascade intensity @xmath20 it is mainly determined by the error of known [ 6 ] intensities of the high - energy primary transitions @xmath21 used for normalization of the @xmath10 value . as it was shown in [ 5 ] , uncertainty in determination [ 7 ] of dependence of @xmath10 on the primary transition energy from the experimental spectra ( each of them is the sum of two distributions ) can be negligible if @xmath22 detectors with 20 - 25% and higher efficiency are used in the experiment .",
    "this is true at least for even - odd deformed and even - even spherical nuclei .",
    "this conclusion unambiguously follows from the extrapolation [ 4 ] of intensity distribution of cascades ( resolved in the spectrum as pairs of peaks ) to zero value @xmath23  more than 95 - 99% of intensity of cascades with intermediate levels lying below @xmath18 is determined in the experiment .",
    "so , at any energy of the cascade primary transition the shape of the functional dependence    @xmath24    is ascertained with relative error not more than several percent . therefore ,",
    "systematic error in determination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 from combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( 1 ) is practically caused by error in obtaining absolute @xmath10 values , i.e. , by error of @xmath21 .",
    "comparison [ 8 ] between the known [ 6 ] and measured in budapest values of @xmath21 shows that the uncertainty of any arbitrary taken intensity @xmath21 for the data [ 6 ] can be estimated as 20% .",
    "normalization of @xmath10 to absolute value is made using 5 - 10 ( supposedly non - correlated in errors ) values of @xmath21 .",
    "so , one can expect , that the total experimental intensity @xmath10 differs from the actual value not more than by 40% , if @xmath10 is normalized using data [ 6 ] .",
    "the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 resulting in a given magnitude of @xmath20 , in practice , can not be estimated using conventional in mathematical statistics procedure of error transfer .",
    "therefore , these parameters were estimated in other manner . varying the total experimental intensities of cascades from 70 to 120% in @xmath17 and from 50 to 100% in @xmath15 we obtained an ensemble of functional dependences of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which permit reproduction of these @xmath10 values .",
    "variation coefficient @xmath27 is stipulated by the fact that the total intensities of the observed primary transitions and two - step cascades to low - lying levels ( @xmath28 mev ) for isotopes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 equal 65 - 70% and 92 - 95% , respectively . besides",
    ", statistics of the accumulated coincidences and high energy resolution permit one to neglect the errors of procedure of decomposition of the experimental spectra into two components corresponding to solely primary and solely secondary cascade transitions .",
    "probable @xmath7 and @xmath6 values obtained in this manner are shown in figs .  1 - 4 and 5 - 8 , respectively .",
    "these data are compared in figs .",
    "9 and 10 with the model values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 in function of coefficient @xmath27 for four excitation energies and four energies of @xmath0-quantum .",
    "the main result of this analysis ",
    "@xmath7 in this interval of variation of @xmath27 ( probably overlapping the region of possible error of @xmath10 ) weakly changes at the excitation energy below @xmath5 .",
    "variations of the energy dependence of @xmath6 in this case are much stronger . in the all considered cases ,",
    "however , the sum of @xmath31 for @xmath32 mev does not exceed the sum of the calculated according to [ 10 ] value @xmath33 and value @xmath34 if their ratio is normalized to the experimental ( approximated ) value .",
    "taking into account that the sign of derivative of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "10 differs for different energies @xmath36 and its value is close to zero at 2.5 - 3.0 mev for three nuclei discussed here and some bigger for @xmath37 one can expect that the strength functions is estimeted with the maximum possible reliability independently on @xmath20 at least at this @xmath0-transition energy .",
    "in the framework of the enumerated above assumptions about the cascade @xmath0-decay process one can conclude that significant decrease in the level density of heavy , at least , nuclei as compared with the predictions of the fermi - gas model can not be explained by some revealed up to now uncertainties of the method [ 1 ] .",
    "the observed results [ 1 ] on the level density can be qualitatively explained within modern nuclear models directly accounting [ 13 ] for dynamics of breaking of the nucleon pairs or within the generalized model of superfluid nucleus [ 2 ] . in both cases",
    "the corrections of no principle of these models are needed . in the former ,",
    "the second pair must break at @xmath38 mev higher excitation energy as compared with [ 13 ] . in the latter",
    ", the temperature of the expected phase transition of a nucleus from superfluid to usual state should be decreased by a factor of about 1.5 . besides , the notions of the calculation of entropy below the point of the expected phase transition should be slightly corrected .",
    "this provides appearance of the clearly expressed step - like structure in energy dependence of level density that is observed in experiment [ 1 ] .",
    "both conditions have analogies in the experimental data on super - conductivity ( including high - temperature one ) and super - fluidity of usual matter and , therefore , can be considered as quite possible .    of course",
    ", one can not exclude existence of unknown factors which distort the simple enough model [ 1 ] of the @xmath0-decay process .",
    "first of all , it is necessary to test in direct experiment the possible and probably strong influence of the wave function structure of neutron resonance on the @xmath0-decay process of high - lying states of a nucleus .",
    "observation of strong correlation of reduced neutron width of resonance @xmath39 and partial widths of the cascade primary transitions to the levels with @xmath40 mev would decrease discrepancy between the results [ 1 ] and notions of old models from one hand but require significant modification of the model ideas of a nucleus from other hand .",
    "these problems can be solved in experimental study of two - step cascades in different resonance of the same nucleus .",
    "this requires , however , to increase statistics of @xmath41 coincidences .",
    "development of new of principle methods to study the @xmath0-decay process can bring to the analogous result .",
