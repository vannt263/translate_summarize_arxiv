    "<S> the lhcb collaboration announced two pentaquark - like structures in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the current information on the narrow structure at 4.45  gev is compatible with kinematical effects of the rescattering from @xmath1 to @xmath2 : first , it is located exactly at the @xmath3 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> second , the mass of the four - star well - established @xmath4 is such that a leading landau singularity from a triangle diagram can coincidentally appear at the @xmath3 threshold , and third , there is a narrow structure at the @xmath3 threshold but not at the @xmath5 and @xmath6 thresholds . in order to check whether that structure corresponds to a real exotic resonance </S>",
    "<S> , one can measure the process @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath8 structure exists in the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution as well , then the structure can not be just a kinematical effect but is a real resonance , otherwise , one can not conclude the @xmath8 to be another exotic hadron . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is also worthwhile to measure the decay @xmath9 : a narrow structure at 4.45  gev but not at the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds would exclude the possibility of a pure kinematical effect .    the observation of many different hadrons half a century ago stimulated the proposal of the quark model as a classification scheme  @xcite , and helped to establish quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the fundamental theory of the strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> since then , hundreds of more hadrons were discovered . </S>",
    "<S> a renaissance of hadron spectroscopy studies started in 2003 , and since then a central topic is the identification of the so called exotic hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> these are states beyond the naive quark model scheme , in which mesons and baryons are composed of a quark  </S>",
    "<S> antiquark pair and three quarks , respectively . most of the new interesting structures were observed in the mass region of heavy quarkonium , and are called @xmath12 states ( for a list of these particles and a review up to 2014 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath13  @xcite extremely close to the @xmath14 threshold is widely regarded as an exotic meson , and the charged structures with a hidden pair of heavy quark and heavy antiquark such as the @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite , and @xmath18  @xcite would be explicitly exotic were they really resonances , i.e. poles of the @xmath19-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> candidates for explicitly exotic hadrons were extended to the pentaquark sector by the new lhcb observations of two structures , denoted as @xmath20 , in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution with masses ( widths ) @xmath21  mev ( @xmath22  mev ) and @xmath23  mev ( @xmath24  mev ) , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were suggested to be hadronic molecules composed of an anticharm meson and a charmed baryon  @xcite the existence of which were already predicted in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were also discussed as a pentaquark doublet in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> normally , such structures are observed as peaks in invariant mass distributions of certain final states , and fitted by using the breit  wigner parameterization to extract the masses and widths . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a procedure is problematic . on the one hand , many of these structures are very close to certain thresholds to which they couple strongly . in this case , a use of breit  wigner is questionable and one needs to account for the thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved using the flatt parameterization  @xcite ( a method in this spirit for near - threshold states with coupled channels and unitarity was recently proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . on the other hand , not </S>",
    "<S> every peak should be attributed to the existence of a resonance . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , kinematical effects may also show up as peaks . </S>",
    "<S> such kinematical effects correspond to singularities of the @xmath19-matrix as well , but they are not poles . in general , they are the so - called landau singularities including branch points at thresholds and more complicated ones such as the triangle singularity , also called anomalous threshold  ( detailed discussions of these singularities can be found in the textbooks  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observability of the triangle singularity was extensively discussed in 1960s ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) , and recently was used to explain some structures including the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there were suggestions that some of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states were threshold effects  @xcite and the threshold effects might be enhanced by triangle singularities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a general discussion of @xmath19-wave threshold effects , see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to establish a structure as a resonance , one has to discriminate it from such kinematical effects . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is possible . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a resonance can be distinguished from threshold kinematical effects only in the elastic channel which is the channel with that threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to discuss the possible kinematical effects for the narrower structure at 4.45  gev in the lhcb observations and suggest measurements to check whether it is a real exotic resonance or not .    </S>",
    "<S> we first notice that the @xmath8 structure is exactly located at the threshold of a pair of @xmath30 and proton , @xmath31  mev , and @xmath32 if the angular momentum between the @xmath30 and proton is a @xmath33-wave , then the two - body system can have quantum numbers @xmath34 , compatible with the favored possibilities @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the @xmath3 can rescatter into the observed @xmath2 by exchanging soft gluons . </S>",
    "<S> two possible diagrams for such a mechanism are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ] , where ( a ) is a two - point loop with a prompt three - body production @xmath37 followed by the rescattering process @xmath38 , and in ( b ) the @xmath39 pair is produced from an intermediate @xmath40 state and the proton rescatters with the @xmath30 into the @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss them subsequently .     </S>",
    "<S> rescattering in the decay @xmath41 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to notice that the @xmath30 can be produced in the weak decays of the @xmath42 with a similar magnitude as that for the @xmath43 . in the bottom quark </S>",
    "<S> decays , the charm quark is produced via the mediation of the @xmath44-boson . after integrating out the off - shell mediators , one arrives at two effective operators for the @xmath45 transition : @xmath46 [ \\bar s^\\beta\\gamma_{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_5 ) b^\\beta],\\quad { \\mathcal{o}}_2= [ \\bar c^{\\alpha}\\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5 ) c^{\\beta } ] [ \\bar s^{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_5 ) b^{\\alpha}]~ , \\label{eq : operators}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one - loop qcd corrections have been taken into account to form @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath48 are color indices , and they should be set to be the same in @xmath49 in order to form a color - singlet charmonium state . </S>",
    "<S> the quark fields , @xmath50 $ ] , will directly generate the charmonium state . </S>",
    "<S> a charmonium with @xmath51 like the @xmath43 is produced by the vector current , while the axial - vector current tends to produce the @xmath30 with @xmath52 and the @xmath53 state with @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> since the vector and axial - vector currents have the same strength in the weak operators , one would expect the production rates for the @xmath43 and @xmath30 are of the same order in @xmath55 quark decays . </S>",
    "<S> corrections to this expectation come from higher - order qcd contributions but are sub - leading  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , such an expectation is supported by the @xmath56 meson decay data  @xcite : @xmath57    having made these general observations , we return to the discussion of the @xmath58 decays measured by lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> we will first focus on the two - point loop diagram whose singularity is a branch point at the @xmath3 threshold on the real axis of the complex @xmath59 plane , where and in the following @xmath60 denotes the invariant mass of the @xmath2 or @xmath3 system . </S>",
    "<S> it manifests itself as a cusp at the threshold if the @xmath3 is in an @xmath19-wave . for higher partial waves , </S>",
    "<S> the threshold behavior of the amplitude is more smooth and a cusp becomes evident in derivatives of the amplitude with respect to @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are only interested in the near - threshold region , both of the @xmath30 and the proton are nonrelativistic . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the amplitude for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ]  ( a ) is proportional to the nonrelativistic two - point loop integral @xmath61 where @xmath62 denote the masses of the intermediate states in the loop , @xmath63 is the reduced mass and @xmath64 is the total energy . here , we consider the case for the @xmath33-wave @xmath3 which has quantum numbers compatible with the possibilities of the @xmath8 reported by the lhcb collaboration , though one should be conservative to take these determinations for granted as none of the singularities discussed here was taken into account in the lhcb amplitude analysis . </S>",
    "<S> if we take a gaussian form factor , @xmath65 , to regularize the loop integral , the analytic expression for the loop integral is then given by @xmath66 , \\label{eq : gexplicit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 , and the imaginary error function @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> a better regularization method should be applied in the future , but for our present study such an approach is fine .     amplitude shown in fig .  9 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curve represents the best fit . </S>",
    "<S> it is counterclockwise with increasing the @xmath69 invariant mass from 4.41  gev to 4.49  gev , the same range as for the lhcb diagram . ]    </S>",
    "<S> using an amplitude with the loop function given in eq .  , one can get a peak around the @xmath3 threshold . in order to have a more quantitative description of the effect of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ]  ( a ) , we fit to the argand plot for the @xmath8 amplitude depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we fit to both the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath8 amplitude by minimizing the sum of the chi - squared values for both the real and imaginary parts . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit with a real background term has @xmath73 and is given by @xmath74 , @xmath75  gev@xmath76 and @xmath77  gev . </S>",
    "<S> with a real background term , the amplitude in eq .   can only be complex when the energy is larger than the @xmath3 threshold , as is evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : argand ] . </S>",
    "<S> the background is in general complex as a result of the fact that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 can go on shell and many @xmath80 resonances can contribute to the @xmath81 state . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : sing ] the motion of the solutions in the complex @xmath60 plane . as discussed in 1960s , see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only one of the singularities can have an impact on the amplitude in the physical region defined on the upper edge of the real axis on the first riemann sheet of the complex @xmath59-plane , and it is effective only in a limited region of one of these variables . here </S>",
    "<S> we want to investigate in which values the @xmath40 mass can take so that there can be an evident singularity effect in the @xmath2 invariant mass , @xmath60 . according to the coleman  </S>",
    "<S> norton theorem  @xcite , the singularity is in the physical region only when the process can happen classically , which means that all the intermediate states are on shell , and the proton emitted from the decay of the @xmath40 moves along the same direction as the @xmath30 and can catch up with it to rescatter . </S>",
    "<S> let us start from a very large mass for the @xmath40 so that it can not go on shell in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ]  ( b ) . decreasing this mass , when it has a value @xmath95 it can go on shell . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath30 is at rest in the rest frame of the decaying particle @xmath42 , and the proton emitted from the decay @xmath96 can definitely rescatter with the @xmath30 classically . </S>",
    "<S> this is the point shown as a filled triangle with @xmath97  gev , labelled as a , on the solid curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sing ] . </S>",
    "<S> if we decrease @xmath98 further , the @xmath30 will speed up and the proton will slow down . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lower bound of @xmath98 for the rescattering process that happens classically is given by the case when the @xmath30 and the proton are at a relative rest , i.e. when the @xmath3 invariant mass is equal to their threshold . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at this point the triangle singularity coincide with the normal threshold , and one gets @xmath99 if @xmath98 is smaller than @xmath100 , the proton would not be able to catch up with the @xmath30 and the triangle diagram can only be a quantum process . for the case of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ]  </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) , @xmath100 is given by @xmath101  gev , labelled as b and also shown as a filled triangle in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diag ] . in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sing ] , in order to move the singularity trajectories away from the real axis , we give a 10  mev width to the @xmath40 . for a vanishing width </S>",
    "<S> , the solid and dashed trajectories would pinch the real axis at @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> we can now know on which riemann sheet of the complex @xmath59-plane the singularities are located . </S>",
    "<S> since only when @xmath98 is between @xmath100 and @xmath103 ( the part between the two filled triangles in the figure ) , the process can happen classically and the singularity can be on the physical boundary ( if the @xmath40 width vanishes ) , we conclude that the singularity shown as the solid curve is always on the second riemann sheet . on the contrary , the singularity whose trajectory is shown as the dashed curve in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sing ] is on the second riemann sheet when it is above the real axis , and it moves into the lower half plane of the first riemann sheet otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is always far away from the physical boundary , and does not have any visible impact on the physical amplitude . for an easy visualization of the kinematical region between a and b </S>",
    "<S> , we show the corresponding dalitz plot in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sing ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing observation for the case of interest is that within the range between 1.89  gev and 2.11  gev , there is a four - star baryon @xmath4 with @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath101  gev , the triangle singularity is just at the @xmath3 threshold which can provide a further threshold enhancement .   and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 states  @xcite . ] giving a finite width to the @xmath4 , the singularity moves away from the real axis into the lower half plane of the second riemann sheet ( it is located at @xmath105  mev for @xmath106  gev ) , and the enhancement is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 has a relatively small width ( 60 to 100  mev  @xcite ) so that there can still be an important enhancement . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : amp ]  ( b ) , we show the absolute value of the triangle loop integral with the @xmath3 in a @xmath33-wave for three different widths ( for a discussion of the triangle singularities in nonrelativistic triangle loop integral , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is clearly an enhancement nearby 4.45  gev even when the width is taken to be 100  mev .    in the above </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that kinematical effects can result in a narrow structure around the @xmath3 threshold in the @xmath2 invariant mass of the @xmath107 decay . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a natural question is whether such an effect happens at other thresholds , in particular those related to the @xmath3 through heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a result of the hqss , the operator for annihilating a @xmath30 and creating a @xmath43 is contained in @xmath108 where the fields @xmath109 and @xmath110  @xcite annihilate the @xmath19-wave and @xmath33-wave charmonium states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the rescattering interaction strength for @xmath111 or @xmath112 is of similar size as that for the @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> one might naively expect enhancements at both the @xmath6 and @xmath5 thresholds in the @xmath2 invariant mass as well . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the case . as we have shown in eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> at leading order in @xmath114 , the charmoium is produced by the @xmath115 $ ] current . </S>",
    "<S> this current has no projection onto the @xmath116 or @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the production of the @xmath118 in the @xmath55 decays can come only from higher - order qcd corrections which are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there is no enhancement at the @xmath6 and @xmath5 thresholds in @xmath42 decays , which is consistent with our expectation .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis is applicable to any @xmath55 quark decay in which the @xmath118 is directly generated by the weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> but it would be different if the initial decay heavy particle contains a charm or anticharm quark in addition to the bottom quark . </S>",
    "<S> processes of this type include the decays of the @xmath119 meson and the doubly - heavy baryon @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit calculation of @xmath119 decays @xcite indicates that the @xmath118 can have similar production rates with the @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the large amount of data on the @xmath119 to be accumulated by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite , it appears very promising to investigate the @xmath5 and @xmath6 threshold effects in the future . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one can study the threshold effects in the prompt production of the @xmath2 at the lhc , or in the @xmath121 decays into the @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    in conclusion , what we have shown here </S>",
    "<S> is that the present information on the narrow structure around 4.45  gev observed by the lhcb collaboration is compatible with kinematical effects around the @xmath3 threshold : first , it is located exactly at the @xmath3 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> second , the mass of the four - star well - established @xmath4 coincidentally makes the triangle singularity on the physical boundary located at the @xmath3 threshold , despite a small shift into the complex plane due to the finite width of the @xmath4 , and third , the @xmath30 , instead of the @xmath116 or @xmath117 , can be easily produced in the weak decays of the @xmath42 by the @xmath124 current so that there can be an evident effect at the @xmath3 , but not the @xmath5 or @xmath6 , threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the most important question regarding the structure around 4.45  gev is whether it is just a kinematical effect or a real resonance . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , kinematical singularities , including both the normal threshold and the triangle singularity , can not produce a narrow near - threshold peak in the elastic channel , which is the @xmath3 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the interaction strength in the elastic channel controls the threshold behavior , and there can be a narrow near - threshold peak only when the interaction in the elastic channel is strong enough to produce a pole in the @xmath19-matrix which corresponds to a real resonance . on the contrary , one can not simply determine the interaction strength for the inelastic channel ( @xmath113 in our case ) because it can always interfere with a direct production of the final state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the question can be answered by analyzing the process @xmath7 : if there is a narrow structure just above threshold in the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution , then the structure can not be just a kinematical effect and calls for the existence of a real pentaquark - like exotic resonance , otherwise , one can not conclude the @xmath8 to be another exotic hadron . </S>"
