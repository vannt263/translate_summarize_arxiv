    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have been intensively investigated in the past few years for their applications in next - generation nanoelectronics , including spintronics@xcite and valleytronics.@xcite transition - metal chalcogenides ( tmcs ) of the form tx@xmath0 ( t = mo , w , x = se , s ) are of particular interest , as they have several interesting intrinsic properties , such as direct band gaps@xcite or giant spin - orbit ( so ) coupling ( soc)@xcite in monolayered ( ml ) forms .",
    "excellent electronic properties of tmcs have recently led to the production of first nanoelectronic devices based on tmc - mls , including thin film transistors , logical circuits , amplifiers and photodetectors.@xcite it has also been reported that external stimuli , e.g.  tensile strain,@xcite can strongly influence the electronic properties of tx@xmath0 layers .",
    "soc is a relativistic effect that occurs for honeycomb 2d lattices with a broken inversion symmetry , such as in 2@xmath3 tmc - mls .",
    "thus , for mos@xmath0 , a giant spin - orbit - induced band splitting of @xmath4100 mev was reported from raman experiments.@xcite in agreement , from first - principles the so splitting in tx@xmath0 mls was calculated to be in the range 148480 mev , with the limiting values for mos@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 mls , respectively.@xcite at the same time , tx@xmath0 monolayers are very stable with respect to external electric fields , with a semiconductor - metal transition being reported for fields stronger than 4 v @xmath2.@xcite in contrast , tx@xmath0 bilayers have been found to be much more sensitive to external electric fields , with band gaps reducing linearly with respect to the external field.@xcite it is very interesting to note that the so splitting in tx@xmath0 monolayers disappears nearly completely when going to bilayers ( bls ) . indeed , in spin- and valleytronic applications , it may be useful to have a material where the polarization can be switched on and off .",
    "this can be achieved if the inversion symmetry in the bilayer is broken by an external factor , most conveniently by an electric field normal to the lattice plane .",
    "it has already been suggested that the inversion symmetry can be broken in mos@xmath0 bls through an external electric field applied normal to the planes , which leads to a potential difference between individual layers , and allows the control of valley polarization.@xcite this effect should be even more pronounced for tx@xmath0 materials that show stronger spin - orbit splittings in the monolayers , i.e. for ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0.@xcite yuan et al.@xcite have investigated the out - of - plane zeeman - type spin polarization in wse@xmath0 bilayer - based transistor using ionic - liquid - gate voltage .",
    "they have shown that such spin splitting can be induced and modulated by a perpendicular external electric field .",
    "therefore , we investigate here in detail the electronic structure of tx@xmath0 bilayers as function of an external electric field .",
    "we will show that the same so splittings can be achieved in tx@xmath0 bilayers as in the corresponding monolayers , for the field strength in the range of 200 - 600 mv @xmath2 . at this field strength ,",
    "the materials are still semiconductors with appreciable band gaps of more than 500 mev . however , the band gap is a linear function of the applied electric field and this provides additional means to tune the electronic properties .",
    "we have found that the field strength of about 1.5 v @xmath2 is sufficient for the semiconductor  metal transition .",
    "this electric field strength can be achieved experimentally using , e.g.  ionic liquid gating.@xcite",
    "all calculations were carried out using density - functional theory ( dft ) with the pbe@xcite exchange - correlation functional , with added london dispersion corrections as proposed by grimme,@xcite and with becke and johnson damping ( bj - damping ) as implemented in the adf / band package.@xcite local basis functions ( numerical and slater - type basis functions of valence triple zeta quality with one polarization function ( tzp ) ) were adopted for all atom types , and the frozen core approach ( small core ) was chosen .",
    "the @xmath5-point mesh over the brillouin zone was sampled according to the wiesenekker - baerends scheme,@xcite where the integration parameter was set to 5 , resulting in 15 @xmath5-points in the irreducible wedge .",
    "all tmc - bl structures ( atomic positions and lattice vectors ) are fully optimized including scalar relativistic ( sr ) corrections , which are expressed by the zero order regular approximation ( zora)@xcite to the dirac equation .",
    "the implementation of the analytical gradients for sr - zora is based on a modication of the energy gradients implementation in the non - relativistic case .",
    "the difference to the latter arises in the calculation of the kinetic energy gradients .",
    "moreover , the full relativistic zora includes both the sr - zora and spin - orbit interactions.@xcite the maximum gradients threshold was set to @xmath6 hartree @xmath2 .",
    "the lattice parameters and interlayer spacings are given in table 1 . to obtain electronic structures ( band structures and resulting electronic band gaps and spin - orbit splittings ) at these optimized coordinates we performed full relativistic zora calculations.@xcite at the same level of theory ,",
    "the response to an external electric field normal to the lattice planes , ranging from 0.01.5 @xmath2 , has been calculated . in the adf / band ,",
    "the static electric field is homogeneous and implemented along the @xmath7-direction ( i.e.  the non - periodic direction ) .",
    "it is important to note that neither the applied electric fields nor soc do influence the bl geometries .",
    ".[tab:1 ] calculated lattice parameters @xmath8 ( in  ) and the interlayer distances , @xmath9 , measured between the metal planes ( in  ) of all tmc bilayers at the equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding values from ref.@xcite are given for comparison .",
    "note that the authors used fixed experimental structures .",
    "the reoptimized values for mos@xmath0 bl from ref.@xcite is given in parethesis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     interestingly , the effect of the external electric field on the mobilities of electrons and holes is quite different in the four tx@xmath0 structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : em ] ) . for mos@xmath0 ,",
    "effective hole masses @xmath10 increase with the applied field due to flattening of the bands . as the cbm moves already at small applied field ( 400 mv @xmath2 ) to the @xmath11 point in the bz",
    ", we observe a discontinuity of the effective electron masses @xmath12 and assume a strong increase in electron mobility for this system . in mose@xmath0 , the @xmath12 increase with applied electric field , while the @xmath10 remain stable .",
    "both tungsten dichalcogenides show stable @xmath12 with respect to the external field .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath10 in wse@xmath0 , while for ws@xmath0 vbm changes from @xmath13 to @xmath11 in the bz at fields higher than 200 mv @xmath2 . in general ,",
    "the effective masses are smaller for the tungsten compounds , with the exception of @xmath12 for mos@xmath0 at high external fields .",
    "two reports have already discussed an interesting evolution of the electronic band gap @xmath14 as function of the external field .",
    "ramasubramaniam and co - workers@xcite have shown that the electronic structure of mox@xmath0 ( x = s , se , te ) and ws@xmath0 bilayers can be influenced with a perpendicular electric field .",
    "their first - principles based plane wave simulations suggested that the electronic band gaps decrease linearly with the field strength , resulting in a semiconductor - metal transition in the range of relatively small electric fields of 200 - 300 mv @xmath2 .",
    "these values have been challenged by liu et al.@xcite , who reassessed these studies focussing on one material ( mos@xmath0 ) , but considered different stacking configurations of molybdenum and sulphur atoms in the 2d layers .",
    "they reported that the electric field strength , at which the band gap closes , is significantly higher , between 1.0 and 1.5 v @xmath2 , and suggested that the smaller values reported by ramasubramaniam et al.@xcite are caused by applying inappropriate constrains to the symmetry of the bilayer structures .",
    "however , liu et al .",
    "focussed on mos@xmath0 and its band gap without considering so effects .",
    "we have calculated the band gap ( @xmath14 ) evolution with respect to the applied electric field strength for various tx@xmath0 bilayers .",
    "our results , obtained using explicit two - dimensional boundary conditions and thus avoiding possible artifacts due to periodicity in the direction normal to the layers , support the assessment of liu et al.@xcite : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] , the electronic band gaps reduce nearly linearly with applied field strengths and the materials undergo a semiconductor - metal transition at 1.25 v @xmath2 and 1.50 v @xmath2 for wx@xmath0 and mox@xmath0 bls , respectively .     calculated electronic band gaps ( @xmath14 ) and dipole moments ( @xmath15 ) of tx@xmath0 bilayers as function of applied perpendicular electric field . for comparison , @xmath14 is reported for both soc and zora calculations.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in more detail , our calculations agree well with other first - principles simulations where available .",
    "for example , at the equilibrium , mos@xmath0 bl is an indirect band gap semiconductor with @xmath14 of 1.26 ev in excellent agreement with the calculations of ramasubramaniam et al.@xcite who have obtained 1.26 ev from the fixed experimental structures , and 1.13 ev from structures optimized at the pbe - d2 level .",
    "those values correspond , however , to a different system of higher symmetry , and the smaller @xmath14 values of the optimized structures of ramasubramaniam et al.@xcite are due to the elongated in - plane lattice vectors ( see also tab .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier work where we have shown that under tensile strain the band gap reduces almost linearly.@xcite for the mos@xmath0 bl , liu et al.@xcite obtained 1.09 ev band gap at the lda level and the semiconductor  metal transition at external field of @xmath41.5 ev @xmath2 , in close agreement with our results , but three times larger than those reported by ramasubramaniam et al.@xcite    our calculations further show that w - based systems close their band gaps at lower fields than their mo - based counterparts .",
    "this difference is not captured without considering so effects .",
    "ws@xmath0 bilayers show the strongest band gap dependence on the external field .",
    "this system inherently has the largest band gap among all the studied systems , but its @xmath14 decreases most rapidly with the applied field .",
    "the polarization of the lattice planes is reflected by the induced dipole moments @xmath15 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bg ] ) and the electron density distribution plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "dipole moments are significantly larger than for the respective monolayers.@xcite within the field strengths applied in this work , the dipole moments for all systems increase linearly with the applied field . for critical field strengths , @xmath15 of sulphide bls are smaller than for selenides by @xmath41.0 debye .",
    "density difference maps calculated at zero and critical electric field strengths for the ts@xmath0 ( left ) and tse@xmath0 ( right ) bilayers.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "in summary , spin splitting due to the spin - orbit coupling can be induced in centro - symmetric transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers by an external electric field applied perpendicular to the layers .",
    "the necessary electric fields have a magnitude that can be reached by applying a gate voltage .",
    "thus , the electronic properties of tx@xmath0 bilayers can be controlled in a simpler and more effective way compared to mechanical deformations .",
    "the electric field causes polarization of individual layers in such a way that the inversion symmetry is broken . as result ,",
    "band structures are strongly altered and the spin splitting due to the stark effect can be enhanced in the valence and conduction bands .",
    "the resulting materials are spin- and valley - polarized semiconductors .",
    "in addition , the electronic band gaps of all tx@xmath0 bilayers reduce linearly with applied field and eventually these systems undergo a transition from semiconducting to metallic phase at field strengths of 1.2 v @xmath2 and 1.5 v @xmath2 for w- and mo - based tx@xmath0 bilayers , respectively . as such field strengths",
    "could be realized in practical nanoelectronic devices , we expect very interesting application possibilities in the emerging field of spin- and valleytronics .",
