    "in a previous paper @xcite  we have discussed how functions of position , defined on a discrete lattice of time points , may be analytically interpolated in time by functions of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , defined on a continuum of time points , framed by the lattice , through the use of solutions to schrder s nonlinear functional equation @xcite .  for a more pedagogical discussion to augment this introduction , we encourage readers to look at that companion paper .    if the effect of the first discrete time step is given as the map @xmath2 , for some parameter @xmath3 , schrder s functional equation is@xmath4 with @xmath5 to be determined .",
    "so , @xmath6 where the inverse function @xmath7 obeys poincar s equation,@xmath8 the @xmath9th iterate of ( [ se ] ) gives @xmath10 with @xmath11 acting @xmath9 times , and thus the @xmath9th order functional composition  the so - called splinter  of the functional equation @xmath12 a continuous interpolation between the integer lattice of time points is then , for _ any _ @xmath1,@xmath13 this can be a well - behaved and single - valued function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 provided that @xmath14 is a well - behaved , single - valued function of @xmath0 ,  even though @xmath15 might be , and typically is , multi - valued .     as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the interpolation can be envisioned as the trajectory of a particle , @xmath16 where the particle is moving under the influence of a potential according to hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the velocity of the particle is then found by differentiating ( [ interpolation ] ) with respect to @xmath1,@xmath17 where any dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 is implicitly understood .",
    "therefore , the velocity will inherit and exhibit any multi - valuedness possessed by @xmath18 .     indeed , suppose that hamiltonian dynamics have been specified , trajectories have been computed , and @xmath19 has emerged  in terms of initial velocity and initial position @xmath20 .",
    "a solution of the functional equation ( [ se ] ) can then be constructed , and expressed in very physical terms , as just an exponential of _ the time elapsed along any such particle trajectory _ that passes through position @xmath0 .",
    "that solution is@xmath21 here @xmath22 is the velocity as a function of the position along the trajectory .",
    "( hence @xmath23 , if you wish .  of course",
    ", for a hamiltonian system with time translational invariance , we may supplant @xmath24 in all these expressions , as well as those to follow . )  for a particle moving in a potential @xmath25 at fixed energy , @xmath26 , the velocity can be expressed in the usual way as @xmath27 , with suitably chosen mass units .     when written in a form more closely related to schrder s functional equation ,",
    "the solution ( [ generalpsi ] ) is simply@xmath28 at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and schrder s equation ( [ se ] ) re - emerges .",
    "but , as this construction clearly shows , one must be careful at turning points where @xmath31 , especially if these are encountered at finite times along the trajectory .",
    "typically these turning points produce branch points in @xmath5 so that it is multi - valued .",
    "an interesting physical effect of such branch points , when they are encountered in finite times , is the possibility to switch from one branch of the underlying analytic potential function to another , thereby changing the functional form of the hamiltonian governing the motion along seemingly identical intervals of a real - valued trajectory .",
    "we will therefore call these _ quasi_-hamiltonian systems , and we stress that when such switches occur this is _ not _ standard textbook hamiltonian dynamics .  further explanation will be given below in the context of the logistic map .",
    "the interpolation ( [ interpolation ] ) can also be viewed as a holographic specification on the @xmath32 plane @xcite , determining @xmath33 in the surrounded bulk  from the total data given at the bounding times , @xmath34 .",
    "in this point of view , _ fixed points _ in @xmath0 complete the boundary data and facilitate the solution of schrder s equation through power series in @xmath0 ,  hence leading to @xmath25 _ which was not known a priori _ @xcite .     in this holographic approach",
    ", the potential first appears as a quadratic in @xmath35,@xmath36 up to an additive constant , where any dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 is again implicit .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the potential , @xmath37 follows from that of the velocity profile of the interpolation , defined and given by @xcite@xmath38 monotonic motions between two fixed points , such as occur for the ricker model @xcite , provide the most elementary examples @xcite .",
    "however , situations where one or both of the fixed points are absent were not fully addressed in our previous work .",
    "this is precisely the situation that occurs when turning points are encountered at finite times in the particle dynamics interpretation , and leads to an intriguing modification in the physical picture involving the potential and its effect on the particle trajectories .",
    "we consider here a specific example of such a situation involving the well - studied logistic map of chaotic dynamics , namely _",
    "@xcite_,@xmath39 applying our functional methods to this example , the resulting interpolations from a discrete lattice of time points to a time continuum then allow us to appreciate analytic features of the logistic map , and to derive the governing differential evolution laws  indeed , subtly time - translation - invariant hamiltonian dynamical laws  of the underlying physical system , hence to obtain potentials that were _ not _ previously known .",
    "for the all - familiar logistic map illustrating transition to chaos , the functional interpolation reveals that there are well - defined expressions for the continuous time evolution of this map for _ all _ parametric values of the map , whether chaotic or not .",
    "we obtain agreement with the explicit closed - form solutions of ( [ se ] ) for the special values of the parameters : @xmath40  and  @xmath41 .",
    "( these explicit solutions have been known for almost a century and a half @xcite . )",
    "moreover , as indicated , from ( [ generalv ] )  we can now find the potentials needed to produce these explicit , continuously evolving trajectories in the language of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "a new feature for the potentials so obtained for the @xmath42 case in particular , and also for other values of @xmath43 , is that they must change at discrete intervals of the envisioned hamiltonian particle s motion , to be consistent with the evolution trajectories :  _ every time the particle hits a turning point , the potential changes _",
    "we therefore call the corresponding @xmath44s switchback potentials  and to echo our previous general remarks , we will call the dynamical system as a whole quasi - hamiltonian .  for @xmath42 the switchback potentials",
    "deepen successively and thus lead to more rapid , higher frequency motion , resulting in the familiar chaotic behavior of the discrete @xmath42 logistic map that they interpolate .",
    "the familiar frequency - cascade - and - folding behavior of the chaotic discrete map is thus understood from  indeed , _ explained _ by  the subtle properties of the switchback potentials .",
    "consider in detail the logistic map ( [ logisticmap ] ) on the unit interval , @xmath45   $ ] .",
    "schrder s equation for this map is @xmath46 the inverse function satisfies the corresponding poincar equation,@xmath47 as originally obtained by schrder , there are three closed - form solutions known , for @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath41:@xmath50 note that , while the @xmath5 are multi - valued , the inverse functions are all single - valued",
    ".     more generally , consider a power series for any @xmath3.@xmath51 the poincar equation then leads to a recursion relation for the @xmath3-dependent coefficients.@xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , etc .",
    "the explicit coefficients are easily recognized for @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath41 , and immediately yield the three closed - form cases .",
    "similarly let @xmath56 then , as a consequence of schrder s equation , @xmath57 , and for @xmath58,@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ( integer - valued ) floor function .  in principle , these series solve ( [ pfe ] ) and ( [ sfe ] )  for any @xmath3 , within their radii of convergence .     from extensive numerical studies we believe the radius of convergence for ( [ psiseries ] )  depends on @xmath3 as follows.@xmath61{ccc}% \\left\\vert 1-\\dfrac{1}{s}\\right\\vert   & \\text{if } & 0\\leq s\\leq2\\ , \\\\ &   & \\\\ \\dfrac{s}{4 } & \\text{if } & 2\\leq s\\leq4\\ .",
    "\\right .   \\label{psiseriesradius}%\\ ] ] preliminary work further suggests that these conjectural results can actually be established analytically by comparison with known convergent series , at least in some cases .",
    "the radius of convergence for the inverse function series ( [ psiinverseseries ] ) is intriguing for @xmath62 .  a fit by mathematica to radii obtained numerically from explicit series coefficients",
    "@xmath63 up to @xmath64 , for 20 different values of @xmath3 in this range , using the functional form @xmath65 , gives @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath68 falls from @xmath69 to zero as @xmath3 goes from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "however , for the parameters of most interest , namely @xmath72 , numerical studies suggest the series all have _ infinite _ radius of convergence , indicating the @xmath7 are entire functions for these parameters .",
    "this is true for @xmath73 and @xmath42 , of course , as is evident from ( [ exactcases ] ) .",
    "the numerics provide compelling evidence that this is also true for all intermediate @xmath3 .",
    "given convergent series , the functional equations can then be used to continue the series solutions outside their radii of convergence and thereby obtain accurate determinations of the various branches of @xmath5 , and of the large - but - finite argument behavior of @xmath7 , in a manner familiar from , say , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 functions .",
    "( see @xcite  for details , and the appendix for a numerical example . )",
    "comparison of the results from these series - plus - functional - equation methods with the known exact solutions ( [ exactcases ] ) shows perfect agreement .",
    "the first few terms for @xmath5 and @xmath7 for generic @xmath3 are given explicitly by @xcite@xmath76 from which we infer that @xmath77 and @xmath78 are actually series in @xmath79 with @xmath3-dependent coefficients that are analytic near @xmath80 .",
    "the trajectories interpolating the splinter ( integer @xmath1 ) of the logistic map are then,@xmath81 the trajectories are single - valued functions of the time so long as @xmath82 is single - valued , and in fact , they exist even for @xmath83 as formal series solutions .",
    "@xmath84explicitly , @xmath85    for the three special cases ,  @xmath40 and @xmath41 , there are closed - form results for various quantities of interest .",
    "for example , for @xmath42 , the trajectory and velocity are given by@xmath86 ( as originally presented in @xcite , p 306 ) and by    @xmath87    the last expression evinces a continuous time - translational invariance .",
    "however , this velocity function has branch points ( i.e. turning points ) at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , so some care is needed to determine which branch of the function is involved , particularly when the turning points are encountered at finite times .",
    "the system is therefore a quasi - hamiltonian one , as we have previously indicated , and as we shall discuss in more detail .    with this caveat in mind",
    ", we may thus deduce the velocity profile @xmath90 , the effective potential , and the force for the underlying quasi - hamiltonian system :    @xmath91    note @xmath92 is an unstable fixed point for the system .",
    "also , the system is time - translationally invariant , so these same expressions hold at all times everywhere along a trajectory , _ provided _ due care is taken to determine which branch of the various functions is in effect .",
    "thus @xmath93 , etc .",
    "similar closed - form results hold for the other two solvable cases , @xmath94 and @xmath73 .  in principle , there are also potentials underlying the trajectories for other @xmath3 by dint of the series constructions .",
    "( we illustrate one other case , @xmath95 , in the appendix . )    from the general expression for @xmath96 in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath7 , and with use of the chain rule , the potential may be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath97 , as given  in the introduction by ( [ generalv ] ) .  the schrder auxiliary function",
    "is then recognized as just an exponential of the time function @xmath98 computed along a zero - energy trajectory , as given by ( [ generalpsi ] ) .",
    "the effective potentials for all three closed - form cases are somewhat unusual :  @xmath99 another way to express the potential for @xmath42 is similar in form to that for @xmath94 , namely,@xmath100 indeed , it is well - known that the logistic maps for @xmath42 and @xmath94 are intimately related through the functional conjugacy of the underlying schrder equations .  but note the potential for @xmath94 is in fact complex , since @xmath101 , as are the trajectories under real time evolution for this case .  of course , since the complexity of @xmath102  is solely a multiplicative factor , if we switch to complex time , @xmath103 , then@xmath104 again yields real trajectories @xmath105 .  as trivial as this observation is",
    ", nevertheless it does raise several questions about complex @xmath0 , and about the behavior of @xmath44 in the complex plane .",
    "we discuss only one aspect of this behavior here , and consider non - principal values for the multi - valued functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , _ all _ branches of the @xmath108 function are important to understand the behavior of the explicit trajectories ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) .     *",
    "* switchbacks on the road to chaos .  *",
    "* an interesting _ new _ feature , which we shall call the _ switchback effect _ , appears for a particle moving in the @xmath42 effective potential .",
    "this is a distinguishing feature that we encounter for the @xmath42 chaotic map , but not , say , for the non - chaotic @xmath73 map .",
    "the effect is traceable to the fact that , while the trajectory is single - valued as a function of the time , the velocity and hence the effective potential are _ not _ single - valued as functions of _ position_.",
    "moreover , the branch points of the multi - valued functions are encountered by zero - energy trajectories at _ finite _ times for the @xmath42 case , unlike , say , for the @xmath73 case .  for the latter case",
    ", it takes an infinite time for a particle with zero energy to reach a turning point .",
    "switchbacks are essentially transitions from one branch of the position - dependent velocity function to another , and occur at the turning points encountered at finite times by the interpolating particle trajectories , ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) .  the effect is easily seen upon viewing animations of these trajectories @xcite .",
    "consider a particle with zero total energy that starts in the @xmath109 potential given above , in the region @xmath110 .",
    "if the particle is initially moving to the left , it will continue towards @xmath92 , taking an infinite amount of time to reach that turning point .",
    "but if the particle is initially moving to the right , it will reach the @xmath111 turning point in a _",
    "finite _ amount of time that depends on its initial @xmath0 , as given by @xmath112 so , for example , starting from the midpoint @xmath113 , it takes unit time to reach the turning point at @xmath111 .    upon reaching @xmath111 ,",
    "the explicit form of the time - dependent solution ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) exhibits the classical counterpart of _ a sudden transition _ that keeps @xmath114 , but _ changes the potential _ for the return trip towards @xmath92 , exactly as follows from the particle moving on a different branch of the @xmath108 function .",
    "explicitly , the potential deepens to@xmath115 with the particle s speed changing accordingly as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath84the return velocity profile is now negative , and given by@xmath116 the @xmath108 in this last expression , as well as in @xmath117 , is understood to be the principal value .    moving in this modified negative potential",
    ", it now takes the zero - energy particle a _ finite _ amount of time to travel from @xmath111 down to @xmath92 , as given by @xmath118 .  upon reaching @xmath92 ,",
    "the exact solution ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) exhibits another sudden transition that keeps @xmath114 , but again alters the potential for the return trip towards @xmath111 .  the potential becomes@xmath119 with corresponding changes in the velocity profile .",
    "again , a finite amount of time is needed for the particle to go from @xmath92 to @xmath111 in the potential @xmath120 , as given by @xmath121 .     upon reaching @xmath111 again",
    ", the switchback process continues .",
    "the total energy remains at zero , but the potential for the second return trip further deepens,@xmath122 etc .  in order for the particle to follow the interpolating trajectory ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) specified by the schrder equation for the @xmath42 case",
    ", it has to move under the influence of successively deepening potentials .     at later times",
    ", the effective potential seen by the particle on its zigzag path between the turning points will depend on the total number of previous encounters with those turning points .  in this sense",
    ", the particle remembers its past .",
    "let @xmath123 be the total number of turning points previously encountered on the particle s trajectory .",
    "the motion of the particle  before encountering the next , @xmath124st , turning point is then completely determined , for @xmath42 , by the effective potential ( again , @xmath108 here is understood to be the principal value)@xmath125 where @xmath60 is again the floor function .",
    "that is to say , the potential deepens as @xmath123 increases .",
    "the corresponding velocity profile speeds up : @xmath126 the particle will either be traveling to the left , with @xmath127 for odd @xmath123 , or traveling to the right , with @xmath128 for even @xmath123 , with its speed increasing with @xmath123 .",
    "as mentioned previously , this effect is clearly seen upon viewing numerical animations of the @xmath42 trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is also instructive to plot @xmath129 versus @xmath1 for various @xmath123 , with @xmath130 , to check @xmath114 , as well as to see how the energy would _ not _ be conserved if the potentials were _ not _ switched .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "1.eps    the time for the zero - energy particle to traverse the complete unit interval in @xmath0 while moving through the @xmath131 potential ( the @xmath123th pseudo - half - cycle ) is always finite , for @xmath132:@xmath133 this _ transit time _",
    "decreases monotonically as @xmath123 increases , with @xmath134 .  starting from an initial @xmath0 , with initial @xmath135 , the times",
    "at which changes in the potential occur , i.e. the times at which the particle encounters turning points , are obtained by summing these transit times and then adding @xmath136 .",
    "the transit time sums are simple enough : @xmath137 thus , a particle beginning at @xmath0 , with initial @xmath135 , will encounter its @xmath123th turning point , and the potential @xmath131 will switch on , at time @xmath138 .",
    "the potential @xmath131 will remain in effect for a time span equal to the particle s transit time , @xmath139 , i.e. until the next potential @xmath140 switches on .",
    "the potential index @xmath123 is in fact related to the action for the pseudo - half - cycle @xcite .  for even @xmath123 , we have @xmath141 , while for odd @xmath123 , we have @xmath142 .",
    "thus ( in the units chosen , the mass is @xmath143)@xmath144 where for the first pass through the complete unit interval the action is @xmath145 moreover , @xmath146 for integer @xmath147 , so after the initial crossing , the @xmath148st zigzag @xmath149 ( pseudo - full - cycle ) contributes to the action : @xmath84@xmath150    the progressive deepening of the potential is also evident in the expanding phase - space trajectories for the evolving particle , where the switchbacks enhance the velocity after each encounter with a turning point ( @xmath31 ) .  for example ,",
    "see figure 2 .",
    "2.eps    this figure provides a good opportunity to clarify the differences between conventional hamiltonian and quasi - hamiltonian systems .",
    "the apparent failure to be a conventional hamiltonian system is due entirely to the fact that a given phase - space trajectory seems to repeatedly cross itself at two points ( @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , as shown in the figure ) and at various times .",
    "thus a vector field on the phase space needed to describe the motion in the conventional hamiltonian formalism would appear to be singular at those two points .",
    "these phase - space singularities are tied to the branch point and riemann surface sheet structure of the relevant analytic functions .",
    "in fact , an alternate way to visualize the motion is as a trajectory on the sheets of a riemann surface .",
    "consider the particle moving on the complex @xmath0 plane , and not just the real line segment @xmath151   $ ] , the endpoints of which are now branchpoints .",
    "there are cuts from @xmath152 to @xmath153 and from @xmath70 to @xmath154 .  the particle first moves along the real axis , approaches the cut at @xmath152 , and then goes around the branchpoint such that  @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "the particle returns along the real axis to the origin and encircles the branchpoint at @xmath70 , such that @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "the particle then goes back to @xmath152 and goes around it once more such that again @xmath161 , @xmath156 , and @xmath162 .",
    "the trajectory continues in this way , flipping signs and adding @xmath163s according to the formulae ( [ indexed v ] ) and ( [ indexed v ] ) @xcite .    for particles with initial @xmath135 , a third way to picture the dynamics",
    "is in terms of the total distance traveled by the particle .  in this point of view , the successive @xmath131 patch together to form a continuous potential @xmath164 on the real half - line , @xmath165 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "indeed , the half - line may be thought of as a _ covering manifold _ of the unit interval in @xmath0 , with the previous multi - valued functions of @xmath0 now single - valued functions of @xmath166 .  to avoid stagnation at any of the cusps of @xmath167 , either physical _ or _ conceptual , in this picture the @xmath114 right - moving trajectories",
    "@xmath168 may be considered as limits of positive energy right - movers , @xmath169 .",
    "this limiting process corresponds to the encirclement of the branch points in the riemann surface picture .",
    "3.eps    also , an extended  phase space trajectory involving @xmath168 and @xmath170 gives some improvement over the situation depicted in figure 2 , with the trajectory no longer self - intersecting .",
    "however , the corresponding phase - space vector field would still be singular with cusps appearing in @xmath171 periodically in @xmath168 , similar to the cusps in the potential @xmath167 .",
    "it is again possible to avoid the cusps by considering the extended phase space trajectories as limits of positive energy trajectories , but we leave that for the interested reader to pursue .    finally , in terms of the coordinate transformation introduced in @xcite , namely , the angle @xmath172 the motion is completely unraveled , at least for @xmath42 .  in that case",
    "@xmath114 implies @xmath173 , and the trajectory for all @xmath1 is just that of a particle moving in a repulsive quadratic potential ( inverted sho ) .",
    "this is the easiest example solvable in closed - form by the schrder method @xcite .",
    "the exponentially growing solution ,  @xmath174 , whose values in the real - line cover of the circle are all physically distinct , immediately leads to @xmath96 for the particle moving through the various @xmath175 , as is evident from ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) .    to amplify our discussion of the physics encoded in the switchback potentials",
    ", we note that the chaotic behavior of the @xmath42 motion ( i.e. the sensitive dependence on initial conditions ) follows entirely from the behavior of the inverse schrder function .",
    "the sine function in ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] ) discards any integer multiple of @xmath176 .",
    "so , for large and increasing times the trajectory @xmath177 only depends on digits farther to the right of the decimal in the numerical value of the initial @xmath178 , hence it is sensitive to those initial conditions .  of course , this latter fact is well - known in the context of the discrete @xmath42 map , and has been discussed time and again in the literature for the case where @xmath1 is an integer ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "as is evident from ( [ exacttrajectory4 ] )  the discussion carries over _ mutatis mutandis _ to the continuous time case .",
    "the only point we add here is to emphasize that it is @xmath7 which is responsible for the effect .",
    "insofar as @xmath82 follows from @xmath5 and the latter follows directly from the potential ( as well as the other way round , as discussed in our introduction ) the chaotic behavior follows directly from the specific multi - valued form of the potential .    for other values of @xmath3 , from ( [ trajectory ] ) and ( [ interpolation ] )",
    "we again have @xmath179 , so the distinction between regular and chaotic behavior is again determined entirely by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath7 , hence the asymptotic branch structure of @xmath5 , and hence the form of the switchback potentials .",
    "the link between the analytic potential function and chaotic behavior is arguably somewhat subtle , inasmuch as it requires some computation to determine @xmath5 and @xmath7 , but the link is a direct one .",
    "having said that , there remains a case - by - case need for inspection of @xmath7 to determine chaos or its absence .  at this stage and in this paper ,",
    "we do _ not _ purport to produce a universal analysis of all models  we only present methods that may facilitate such an analysis .",
    "in summary , in this paper we     use a functional equation to convert nonlinear map equations into dynamical systems in the continuous time domain , thereby facilitating the study of such systems .     illustrate this _ holographic _ continuum interpolation technique with the well - known model of the logistic map , explicitly for the chaotic case @xmath42 , an example which foreshadows an analysis for generic @xmath3 .     construct an intricate sequence of switchback hamiltonians which drive the system to just those phase - space trajectories resulting from such an analytic interpolation of the logistic map , and produce the familiar chaotic behavior for @xmath42 .    for nontrivial systems such as the chaotic @xmath42 logistic map illustrated here , in order to produce the global features of the trajectories the potential of the underlying hamiltonian system _",
    "must _ change at each switchback of the motion , as occurs when turning points are reached in finite time .",
    "therefore we have called these systems _ quasi - hamiltonian_.  the trajectories dictate and completely determine the succession of switchback potentials , in a richly extended analogy of inverse scattering techniques .    for values of @xmath3 between @xmath180 and @xmath41 , a _",
    "_ numerical analysis pursuant to the techniques in this paper leads to quasi - hamiltonian systems involving switchbacks among sequences of potentials , eventually producing trajectories that move between elaborate sets of turning points , in general .",
    "this analysis is reported in full in a companion paper @xcite .  however , to make the present paper more self - contained , and perhaps more convincing as to the generality of the switchback effect",
    ", we have included some details for one other case ( @xmath95 ) in an appendix .",
    "to conclude , we encourage experimenters to look in various settings for the particular type of continuous interpolates that we have described , including fluid dynamical experiments , ecological systems , and , more generally , any situation where an inherently continuous parameter ( time , scale , etc . ) has been routinely sampled only at predetermined discrete values .",

    "that is to say , @xmath187 for @xmath188    combining the series data for @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath44 with the functional equations obeyed by them leads to an accurate numerical determination of the functions and the switchback potentials , for any @xmath3 .",
    "the methods are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "numerical results for  @xmath189 , with @xmath190 , are shown in figure 5 along with the expected asymptote , @xmath191 .",
    "this interval in @xmath1 corresponds to plotting @xmath192 for @xmath193 .          for this particular case , the sequence of potentials does not deepen progressively , but",
    "rather the sequence converges , albeit very slowly , onto the stable fixed point of the map , namely , @xmath194 , shown in the figure as a small circle on the @xmath0-axis .",
    "hence the zero - energy particle trajectory will also converge onto this fixed point , rigorously conserving @xmath114 in the process .",
    "although the particle trajectory is not chaotic for @xmath95 , nevertheless the potentials are somewhat more exotic than the @xmath42 case in the sense that there are an _ infinite _ number of branch points for the @xmath95 case .  these may be obtained by iterating the action of the map on @xmath113 .  that is to say , @xmath195 .",
    "these branch points are shown as the turning points of the potential sequence , @xmath196{ccccc}% 0.75 , & 0.562\\,5 , & 0.738\\,281\\ , , & 0.579\\,666\\ , , & \\cdots \\end{array } $ ] , represented by colored dots on the @xmath0-axis in figure 6 .",
    "the branch points may also be seen by flipping the graph of @xmath7 in figure 5 about the sw - ne diagonal , in the usual way , to exhibit the various branches of @xmath5 .",
    "this complicated branch structure for @xmath95 extends to other cases with @xmath197 and most likely accounts not only for the failure to render them in terms of simple , known functions , but also for some of the associated wide - spread mystique that surrounds @xmath5 and @xmath7 in these cases .",
    "of course , @xmath73 and @xmath42 only have branch points at @xmath113 , and at @xmath92 and @xmath71 , respectively , as evident in the closed - form results ( [ exactcases ] ) and as discussed in the text , so these cases are relatively bland by comparison .",
    "the results ( [ interpolation ] )  ( [ generalv ] ) establish strong ties between the @xmath5-functional method and the standard logical sequence conventionally used for time evolution , wherein one begins with a given potential and then computes the trajectory .",
    "perhaps this is not without precedent .  consider a small but macroscopic object made of weakly conducting dielectric material moving in the electric field produced by some charged surfaces .",
    "occasionally the object might come in contact with one of the surfaces ( i.e. hit a turning point ) and exchange some significant amount of electric charge in the process .",
    "this would abruptly change the forces on the object , and correspondingly its potential , affecting the object s motion and altering its subsequent trajectory .  the potential could change abruptly again if the object were to come in contact with another charged surface .  of course , this process is more difficult to model than that of the logistic map .",
    "the @xmath198 case gives a simple , closed - form result , namely , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "however , it is also pathological in the sense it does not yield a particle trajectory from ( [ interpolation ] ) as written .  of course , a scaling limit  might be considered , with @xmath201 fixed as @xmath202 .",
    "we leave this as an exercise for the reader .      for odd @xmath123 , we may think of @xmath203 as a morse index for the @xmath114 phase space pseudo - cycle : @xmath204 .",
    "14 in m. c. gutzwiller , _ chaos in classical and quantum mechanics _ ,",
    "springer , new york ( 1990 ) .    by comparison to the electrically charged object described in a previous footnote , in the case of the particle interpolating the logistic map the charge acquired at the turning point is actually _ topological _ , as is clear in the riemann surface point of view :",
    "the charge is just the winding number for the path of the particle around the branch points ."
