    "a natural question about a dynamical system is how fast it mixes measurable subsets of its domain . in the setting of discrete time piecewise smooth one - dimensional expanding maps",
    ", the rate of decay of correlations for functions of bounded variation gives a quantitative interpretation of the speed of mixing , and is governed by the isolated spectrum of the transfer operator on the space of such functions ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . as there is no general approach to determine this isolated spectrum explicitly ,",
    "detailed studies of specific families of maps , as for example in @xcite and @xcite , are an important step towards a better understanding of quantitative mixing phenomena .    for simplicity , we focus our discussion on piecewise linear markov maps .",
    "a nice property of such maps is that the corresponding transfer operator has a finite matrix representation .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that , even in this special situation , the precise determination of the mixing rate is already a non - trivial task @xcite . on the other hand , using a ulam - like construction @xcite , every expanding ( non - linear ) markov map can be approximated by a sequence of piecewise linear maps . in many circumstances , we can use the mixing rate of high order piecewise linear maps to bound or approximate the mixing rate of the original non - linear maps @xcite .",
    "( this is extended in @xcite to the settings of multi - dimensional expanding maps and of anosov maps . )",
    "historically , on the basis of explicit calculations for some topologically mixing piecewise linear markov maps ( namely the skew doubling maps and skew tent maps ) , badii et al .",
    "@xcite conjectured that , for every topologically mixing and expanding markov map , the mixing rate can be universally bounded from above in terms of a ( generalized ) lyapunov exponent .",
    "a counterexample was soon obtained @xcite by making a non - linear perturbation to these maps . indeed , as observed in @xcite , the lyapunov exponent and the topological entropy only provide a bound from below for the mixing rate via bounded variation observations .    in a continuous time setting ,",
    "a novel aspect of mixing was considered in @xcite .",
    "the domain of a one - dimensional diffusion process was divided into equal subintervals , and the underlying function was composed with an interval exchange map corresponding to a permutation of these .",
    "this typically results in faster mixing than the diffusion alone .    in view of these results , it is of interest to investigate the analogous effect of composition with a permutation for amenable examples of piecewise linear markov maps .",
    "such an investigation began in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , we considered the `` stretch - and - fold '' map @xmath10 for an integer @xmath11 on @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "( when @xmath13 , this is the well - known `` doubling map '' ) .",
    "when @xmath2 is divided into @xmath14 equal subintervals , and @xmath15 is composed with a permutation @xmath16 of these , the lyapunov exponent and topological entropy are unchanged , but , in contrast to the results of @xcite , mixing typically becomes slower .",
    "indeed , there may be permutations @xmath16 such that the new map @xmath17 fails to be topologically mixing . under the hypothesis @xmath18",
    ", we showed that @xmath17 is topologically mixing for all permutations @xmath16 , and we determined explicitly the worst mixing attained as @xmath16 varies .",
    "in fact , the mixing can be made arbitrarily slow by allowing @xmath8 to increase .",
    "this not only shows a striking contrast between the effect of composing with a permutation in the continuous and discrete time settings , but also adds to the collection of piecewise expanding interval maps where mixing rates can be explicitly determined .",
    "indeed , these maps provide an alternative counterexample to the conjecture of badii et al .",
    ", in which no non - linear perturbations are required : the markov structure is changed in an essentially combinatorial manner , and only piecewise linear maps are used .",
    "moreover , since we consider markov partitions with equal subintervals , this has the advantage that the mixing rate can be calculated exactly rather than approximated numerically .    in the present paper ,",
    "we continue this investigation by regarding @xmath19 as the simplest member of a family @xmath4 of interval maps with piecewise constant integer slope @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely , for fixed @xmath0 , and for any sequence @xmath21 , we take @xmath22 to be the interval map with slope @xmath23 on the interval @xmath24 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath25 we consider the family of @xmath26 maps @xmath27 .",
    "taking @xmath28 for all @xmath29 gives the stretch - and - fold map @xmath19 with piecewise constant slope @xmath3 . at the other extreme",
    ", taking @xmath30 gives a map with @xmath31 changes of slope .",
    "we shall refer to this as the @xmath3-fold zigzag map , writing @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "( in the case @xmath13 , the zigzag map @xmath34 is just the familiar `` tent map '' @xmath35 . )",
    "we could equally well take the inverted zigzag map with @xmath36 , and we write @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the partition of @xmath2 into @xmath14 equal subintervals .",
    "we write @xmath39 for the symmetric group , consisting of all @xmath40 permutations @xmath16 of @xmath41 . abusing notation , we also write @xmath16 for the interval exchange map given by the corresponding permutation of the subintervals of @xmath9 : @xmath42 for each @xmath6 and each @xmath7 , the map @xmath43 has piecewise constant slope @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that @xmath44 has topological entropy @xmath45 , and that the lyapunov exponent of @xmath44 is also @xmath45 ; these quantities are therefore unaffected by composition with @xmath16 and hence independent of @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the mixing rate is affected by the combinatorial operation of composition with @xmath16 . in particular",
    ", we shall determine to what extent the mixing properties of @xmath15 are neutralised by composition with an appropriate choice of @xmath16 .    before describing in detail the results of this paper ,",
    "we explain the notion of mixing rate we shall use .",
