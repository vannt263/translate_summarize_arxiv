    "high - energy cosmic rays enter into the earth s atmosphere resulting cascades of secondary particles known as extensive air showers(eas ) .",
    "information regarding the shower generating primary particle have to be derived from the registered information of secondary particles at observation level .",
    "the interpretation of properties of primary radiation derived from air shower measurements depends on the understanding of the complex processes of high - energy interactions during the development of air showers  @xcite . from the number and distribution of various ground particles of the eas",
    ", the reconstruction of energy and the mass of the primary particle can be done . but to relate the observables to primary energy and mass , more reliable algorithms and detailed air shower simulations are needed . by comparing the predictions from simulation with measurements one can draw conclusions on the primary mass composition of the arriving particles .",
    "again predictions from simulations suffer from systematic uncertainties mainly due to statistical fluctuations involved in large - scale experiments and due to modeling of he interactions . while the electro - weak interaction processes are reasonably well understood ; above the attained energy by the man - made accelerator , modeling of hadronic multi - particle production is subject to large theoretical uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "estimation of these uncertainties are further difficult task .",
    "different hadronic interaction models predict different lateral shapes and different number of particles at observation level .",
    "hence , it is possible to test and compare the available interaction models by studying these eas parameters .",
    "moreover , some of these parameters like the muon content , depth of shower maximum @xmath2 , the expected lateral shape etc . also depend on the mass of primary cosmic rays .",
    "heavier primaries lead , on average , to a flatter distribution and lower value of @xmath2and more muons .",
    "corsika  @xcite is a detailed monte carlo program to simulate the 4-dimensional evolution of eas in the atmosphere initiated by hadron , photon or any other particle . in corsika-6990",
    "@xcite , there are seven he models , namely dpmjet 2.55  @xcite , epos 1.99  @xcite , x 3.97  @xcite , qgsjet-01c  @xcite , qgsjetii.3  @xcite , sibyll 2.1  @xcite , and , venus 4.12  @xcite , from which we can choose one model at a time for eas simulation .",
    "+ to explain hadron - hadron / nucleus - nucleus collisions above the energy attainable by the man made accelerators , reliable and consistent hadronic interaction models are to be adopted .",
    "dpmjet , epos , qgsjet , and , sibyll are based on the gribov s reggeon approach  @xcite , of pomeron exchange in multiple scattering .",
    "the pomeron corresponds to microscopic partons ( quarks & gluons ) cascades , can be classified into soft , semi - hard , and hardpomerons .",
    "soft non - perturbative interactions involving large impact parameters and slow energy rise are described as softpomeron exchanges , and are dominant at relatively low energy domain giving important contributions to total , inelastic , and diffractive cross sections . however , in the high energy regime semi - hardpomeron exchange , and , hardpomeron exchange describing hard interactions ( with high energy rise ) at large impact parameter , and at small impact parameters respectively are dominant .",
    "qgsjet  @xcite is an addition of gribov s reggeon approach  @xcite of hadronic and nuclear collisions to the quark - gluon string model of high energy interactions .",
    "it has been generalized to treat nucleus - nucleus interactions and semi - hardprocesses using the so - called semi - hardpomeron approach .",
    "the semi - hardprocesses can be described by enhanced pomeron diagrams and proved to be of extreme importance for a correct treatment of very high energy hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "qgsjet scheme is based on the assumption that individual pomeron exchanges occur independent of each other , which is not true at high energy regime . at high energies parton",
    "cascades strongly overlap and interact with each other .",
    "these effects can be described as pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "this non - linear interaction effects are incorporated into the qgsjet - ii-3 model , which is based on the assumption that corresponding effects are dominated by softpartonic processes .",
    "re summation of essential enhanced contributions corresponding to particular final states of the interaction from uncut diagrams ( representing the elastic scattering ) , and from various unitarity cuts of enhanced pomeron diagrams for all orders , yields the final state .",
    "qgsjet ii-03 is based on the obtained solutions , explicitly treating the corresponding effects in individual hadronic ( nuclear ) collisions @xcite .",
    "epos  @xcite is a newly developed model emerging from venus  @xcite and x models  @xcite .",
    "epos is a parton model , with many binary parton - parton interactions , each one creating a parton ladder .",
    "epos is a quantum mechanical model of multiple scattering approach based on partons and strings .",
    "both the process of the particle production , and the process of cross section calculations are consistent with the conservation of energy in epos .",
    "however for other models energy conservation is not considered for cross section calculations  @xcite . in epos 1.99 reduction of the proton - nucleus cross section",
    "is done for better correlation between the number of muons and the number of electrons at ground based air shower measurement  @xcite .      in corsika",
    "apart from seven high energy interaction models there are three low energy models , namely gheisha  @xcite , urqmd  @xcite , and fluka  @xcite .",
    "the fluka hadron - nucleon interaction models are based on resonance production and decay below a few @xmath3 , and on the dual parton model above .",
    "two models are used also in hadron - nucleus interactions  @xcite .",
    "vs log of primary energy , scaledwidth=50.0% ]          muons are produced mainly by decay of charged pions and kaons in a wide energy range .",
    "usually they are not produced directly on the shower axis .",
    "multiple coulomb scattering occurred in the atmosphere and in the shielding of the detector may change the initial direction of the muon .",
    "it is known that the reconstruction of the longitudinal development of the muon component provides the information similar to that obtained with the fluorescence technique , but in the energy range above that accessible by the detection of fluorescence light @xcite .",
    "thus muon component of eas provides a powerful key for primary mass measurement and as well as provides information regarding hadronic interactions . in some experiment like kascade ,",
    "truncated muon size is calculated by integrating muons between 40@xmath4 and 200@xmath4 .",
    "instead of total number of muons , truncated muon size is considered for eas study  @xcite .",
    "the range of muon truncation is from 140@xmath4 - 360@xmath4 in kascade grande .",
    "the depth of shower maximum contains the information about the mass of the primary cr initiating the shower as well as about the properties of hadronic interactions involved in the process of cascade evolution .",
    "the average value @xmath2depends on the primary energy e and on the number of nucleons a of the primary as given in the eq.1 ,    @xmath5 = @xmath6 ( @xmath7 e - @xmath8 a ) + @xmath9 ( 1 )    where @xmath6 and @xmath9 depend on the the details of hadronic interactions so far as a fixed primary is considered .",
    "their values are very sensitive to changes in cross - section , multiplicity and elasticity  @xcite .",
    "eq.1 can be derived from the simple generalized heitler model of cascade formation due to hadronic primaries , but it is in good agreement with the description of the @xmath2evolution predicted by hadronic models currently in use .",
    "eq.1 can be expressed as ,    @xmath5 = @xmath10 ( @xmath11 e - @xmath12 a ) + @xmath13 ( 2 )    where @xmath10 is known as elongation rate and @xmath13 is the depth of first interaction  @xcite .",
    "another sensitive parameter is @xmath14 , expressing quantitatively the shower to shower fluctuations of @xmath2 .",
    "it depends mainly on the cross section and less strongly on the elasticity .",
    "this makes fluctuations in @xmath2 , a good parameter to study hadronic cross sections at ultra - high energies.@xcite",
    "the shower simulations are performed using corsika-6990 .",
    "hadronic interactions at low energies(e @xmath15 80 @xmath3 ) are modelled using the fluka-2011 code .",

    "epos 1.99 ( fluka ) predicts more muons than qgsjet ii-3 ( fluka ) which is known widely since its inception @xcite .",
    "this difference is explained as more ( anti-)baryon production in epos leads to more muons in eas @xcite .",
