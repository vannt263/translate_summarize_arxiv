    "the prompt emission mechanism for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is commonly attributed to internal shocks due to collisions of shells of different lorentz factors ejected from the vicinity of a compact object @xcite .",

    "however , significant spectral evolution is not expected in this model , and new mechanisms must be invoked to explain those observations that do show spectral evolution during the steep decay phase ( zhang , liang & zhang 2007 )",
    ".    of particular interest are the longest duration grbs in which the relationship between various possible early emission components can be studied .",
    "observationally , very few grbs are detected in @xmath0-rays for more than 400 seconds as quantified using the t@xmath1 parameter .",
    "for example , approximately 0.5% of the batse sample meet this criteria @xcite .",

    "bat triggered instead on a gradual rise which lasted approximately 100 s before the first and strongest peak , centred at t@xmath3 + 120 s. thereafter multiple blended peaks continue the prompt emission out to t@xmath3 + 500600 s. at this point the @xmath0-ray emission appears to return to the count rate at which it began at t@xmath3 , whilst the x - ray emission begins a steep decay lasting until t@xmath3 + 1200 s ( fig .",

    "the x - ray observations cover much of the time period over which bat could detect the source , and we constructed a joint bat - xrt light curve to compare emission from the two bands .",
    "this was done by performing joint power law fits to fine time - sliced bat - xrt ( wt ) spectra , and extrapolating the bat spectra to the xrt energy band .",
    "the main peaks in the multipeaked prompt emission are found to be temporally coincident , strongly suggesting that the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission come from the same component : the grb prompt emission .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath9 band optical data show a slowly rising light curve from t@xmath3 + 2501000 s which is not mimicked in any of the high energy bands ( fig . [ all lightcurves ] ) .",

    "there remains an excess flux dominating from some 2001000 seconds post - trigger .",
    "we speculate that this flux plus the spectral evolution indicate an additional source of prompt emission which does not dominate in the majority of grbs .",
    "interestingly , several , although not all , of the grbs with strong spectral evolution studied in @xcite are also not well fitted by the two - component light curve model ( e.g. grbs 051227 and 060614 , see * ? ? ?",
    "others not well fitted by this modelling procedure , such as grb051117a @xcite were identified by @xcite as having evolution which they attributed to flares .",
    "such grbs may instead be more similar to grb070616 .",
    "grb051117a , for example , shows a long , bright , slowly declining prompt emission period with flaring followed by a sharp drop to a plateau or afterglow phase .",
    "grb070616 may be a case where the flux remains fairly constant , with flaring , up to the sharp drop . among the _",
    "swift _ bat bursts we notice of order 10 bursts with an initially flat high energy light curve , most prominent in grb070616 , which when studied as a sample may provide more evidence in support of either a long - duration central engine or an additional component ( n. lyons et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the _ swift _ era has provided a wealth of information on the early @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission .",
    "the prompt optical emission has been harder to reveal as in most grbs the flux level lies below that accessible to fast - response , modest aperture telescopes .",
    "even so , for those grbs which have been detected the relationship between the optical and x - ray emission is complex . in a very small number of cases",
    "the optical actually lies above the extrapolation of the higher - energy emission ( e.g. grb990123 , * ? ? ?",
    "the optical can be dominated by a component related to the prompt high energy emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more usually , the optical lies below such an extrapolation , as shown for a sample of rotse - detected _ swift _ grbs by yost et al .",
    "( 2007b , using bat data only for the extrapolations ) .",
    "this pattern of diverse behaviour strongly suggests a mixture of components can contribute to the prompt optical emission , including the afterglow ( due to the external shock ) and emission from the prompt fireball ( which may include a reverse shock ) . in the latter case the optical should connect , possibly with a spectral break , with the prompt @xmath0-ray  x - ray spectrum .",
    "few optical datasets have sufficient broadband data to check for consistency in spectral shape as well as overall flux level , limiting our ability to constrain reddening effects as opposed to spectral breaks . for grb070616",
    "the combination of long - duration prompt emission plus early optical multi - colour data can provide some constraints on the relationship between the optical emission and the high - energy prompt emission .",
    "the @xmath9 band light curve shows a rise to a plateau - like phase from the first observation beginning at t@xmath3 + 250 s and extending to t@xmath3 + 1000 s. the optical decay does not follow the steeply decaying x- and @xmath0-ray prompt emission .",
    "a gradual rise would be typical of the start of afterglow emission , seen in a number of bursts @xcite .",
    "we performed a power law fit to the @xmath9 band light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ all lightcurves ] and measure @xmath24  =  -(@xmath44 ) .",
    "this is consistent with predictions for the afterglow rise in the fireball model of @xmath45 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". fits to the three prompt emission seds for grb070616 all show that extrapolation of the high energy spectrum to lower energies overpredicts the optical flux , however this may be overcome with a relatively large amount of intrisic extinction or a combination of extinction and a spectral break , if the optical data are assumed to be prompt emission dominated .",
    "we can compare this burst with other grbs for which well - time - resolved prompt optical data are available , and whose light curves are not afterglow - dominated from early times . for grb050820a @xcite find a rising optical component plus a component correlated with the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "in grb050904 the optical data rose to a plateau before mimicking a flare seen in the x - rays @xcite . similarly in grb051111 @xcite suggest a combination of components produce the prompt optical emission with a significant contribution to the early optical flux from an extension of the higher - energy spectrum .",
    "these are similar to the case of grb061121 @xcite where the high energy prompt emission consisted of a single large peak , which was mimicked in the optical data , although an additional spectrally evolving optical component is also seen .",
    "extrapolation of the high energy spectrum in grb061121 overpredicts the early optical emission , suggesting a spectral break .",
    "we note that the extrapolation of the high energy spectrum to the optical band predicts a relatively higher optical flux in grb061121 than in grb070616 , due to its softer high energy spectrum .    for grb070616",
    "we conclude that strong optical emission associated with the prompt phase and described by a simple extrapolation of the observed higher energy spectrum can not be present without invoking a further spectral break in between optical and x - rays or extinction in the host at the highest end of the currently observed values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can likely rule out the @xmath46external - external \" shock model @xcite , which requires that the broadband prompt emission is produced by one and the same mechanism and any variability is caused by density enhancements in the external medium , given the very different behaviour of the optical and x - ray light curves .",
    "after t@xmath3 + 4000 seconds the x - ray afterglow can be considered ` typical ' of what we know for grb afterglows : the spectral and temporal parameters lie within the range of the @xmath17250 _",
    "swift_-observed grbs .",
    "we test these parameters against the synchrotron model , using the closure relations for the case of a cooling break in between the optical and x - ray bands , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and find that the observed temporal and spectral x - ray slopes are just consistent at the 90% level and therefore follow the expectations for synchrotron emission ( in the slow cooling regime ) .",
    "this result also indicates that the afterglow has not reached the ` jet ' phase , in agreement with the lack of evidence for a jet break during the _ swift _ observations .",
    "we do not find good agreement if the cooling frequency were to lie above the x - ray band , @xmath49 , at this time , consistent with the requirement of a broken power law to best describe the sed of the late - time afterglow spectrum plus optical upper limits .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed spectral break is due to the cooling frequency .",
    "the cooling frequency is likely to lie at or above the x - ray frequencies at earlier times ( @xmath234000 s ) , depending on the circumburst medium density structure , but we can not confirm this since the initial x - ray emission is prompt - dominated .    we find a 90% confidence range for the injected electron energy index , @xmath50 , of 2.683.46 , as determined from the measured x - ray spectral index where @xmath51 .",
    "this is higher than the commonly quoted ` universal ' value of @xmath52 derived from some numerical simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but other numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recently published observational studies of samples of afterglows @xcite find a range of allowed values for @xmath50 which encompass the values we report for grb070616 .",
    "grb070616 has afforded us the rare opportunity to track the detailed spectral and temporal evolution from @xmath0-ray to optical wavelengths throughout much of the prompt emission phase , owing to _ swift s _",
    "fast slew capability , the broadband coverage provided by the combination of _ swift _ with _ suzaku _ wam , and the long prompt emission duration .",
    "the high energy light curve remains generally flat for several hundred seconds before going into a steep decline .",
    "spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearly taking place through the prompt emission ( flat and decaying phases ) of grb070616 , beginning at 285 s out to at least 1000 s. the high energy spectrum from 0.3800 kev is well modelled by a band function .",
    "we track the spectral peak energy moving from 135 kev down to @xmath174 kev and measure a softening of the low energy spectral slope from @xmath53@xmath171.12.3 .",
    "the curvature effect , whilst contributing to the spectral shape , is not dominating during the steep decay at @xmath171000 s.    the presence of an additional component , perhaps not present in most grbs , is favoured by the inability of a two - component fit to model the light curve .",
    "this unusual light curve shape of an initial constant flux followed by a sharp drop , plus the strong spectral evolution , is most prominent in grb070616 , but we note a similar structure can be found in a small number of other grbs which are also not dominated by the curvature effect and not well fit by the two - component model .",
    "we find that the optical data during the prompt phase are not consistent with a simple extrapolation of the high energy spectrum , requiring either significant intrinsic extinction or some extinction plus a break in the spectrum between the x - ray and optical bands .",
    "the afterglow is consistent with the synchrotron model , with the cooling break lying in between optical and x - ray bands at a few thousand seconds after the trigger .",
    "the prompt emission of grb070616 comprises a component well fitted with a band function and a possible further component .",
    "it is clear that both broadband coverage and good time resolution are crucial to pinning down the origins of the complex prompt emission in grbs .",

    "<S> the origins of gamma - ray burst prompt emission are currently not well understood and in this context long , well - observed events are particularly important to study . </S>",
    "<S> we present the case of grb070616 , analysing the exceptionally long - duration multipeaked prompt emission , and later afterglow , captured by all the instruments on - board _ swift _ and by _ suzaku _ wam . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds before going into a steep decline . </S>",
    "<S> spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearly taking place throughout the prompt emission , beginning at 285 s after the trigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peak energy , whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope . the steep decline in flux </S>",
    "<S> may be caused by a combination of this strong spectral evolution and the curvature effect . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate origins for the spectral evolution , ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering instead an additional component dominant during the late prompt emission . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> the case of grb070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadband coverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of the complex prompt emission in grbs .    </S>",
