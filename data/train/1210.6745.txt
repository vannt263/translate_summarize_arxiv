    "as the planetary atmospheric thermal emission or scattered light is detected , detailed multi - band photometry or spectrometry can be used to probe the atmospheric composition and physical properties . however , these studies are challenging given the high contrast and small angular separation between a star and planet . in some systems the presence of a planet before it is detected directly can be suggested by the geometry of a circumstellar debris disk . for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite had predicted the likely existence of a planet around fomalhaut and @xcite of a planet around @xmath4-pictoris .    in the case of fomalhaut  ( @xmath5myr , 7.7pc , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite also announced that fomalhaut  b is likely to cross the dust ring .",
    "a few years later , as they did not detect the object at  4.5@xmath8 m with spitzer , @xcite concluded that `` there is almost certainly no direct flux from a planet contributing to the visible - light signature '' and they proposed an optically thin dust cloud with or without a central object in the super - earth regime to explain the  k08 photometry .",
    "@xcite also rejected direct detection of massive planets and explain the photometry at 0.6 - 0.8@xmath8 m to be a consequence of a swarm of satellites around a 2 - 100@xmath9 planet .",
    "motivated by the controversial status of  fomalhaut  b within the community , including even doubts of its actual existence , we decided to conduct an independent analysis of the  hst public data that were recorded in 2004 , 2006 , 2009 and 2010 .",
    "after describing the observational method in   [ sec : obs ] and our data reduction in   [ sec : reduc ] , we analyze the images to confirm that fomalhaut  b is a convincingly real detection and that it is gravitationally bound to the star . in   [ subsec : astro ] we study various possible orbits to determine if the current astrometry can confirm or reject a dust belt crossing trajectory  ( such as one announced by * ? ? ?",

    "the data that we consider in this paper were obtained with hst with the advanced camera for surveys  ( acs ) in  2004 and  2006  ( programs 10390 and  10598 ) , with the wide - field - camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in 2009 ( program 11818 ) , and the space telescope imaging spectrograph instrument  ( stis ) in  2010  ( program  11818 ) .

    "the swarm mass would be of the order of a few lunar masses .",
    "but these numbers are derived from k08 photometry of an unresolved source .    here",

    "as explained in   [ subsubsec : size ] , the size of the extended source s=1.16au is approximate and at f814w , the image of fomalhaut  b could be reproduced by a source with radius up to s=2.32au .",

    "considering a collision - limited satellite swarm around fomalhaut  b ( i.e. swarm has just started to suffer collisions ) that reproduces the observed  @xmath86 , it imposes a minimum limit for the satellite semimajor axis @xmath95 for a  440myr system  ( i.e. a 440myr collision time , see  kw11 for details ) .",
    "kw11 also study the collision velocities that are required to destroy a large object at the fomalhaut  b position . assuming a steady - state collisional cascade and a two - phase size distribution for the particles , kw11 link the collision velocity to the swarm size  @xmath90 and the planet mass  @xmath94 . using their equations in the case of a resolved object we set a constraint that reads @xmath96  ( kw11 ) .",
    "moreover , kw11 assume that satellite orbits with  @xmath97 are not stable and do not consider them .",

    "the minimum and maximum planetary masses are  @xmath852@xmath9 and  1@xmath100 and the swarm has a total mass 2 - 11@xmath101 and lies at 0.15 - 0.5 hill radii around the planet .    in the case of an unresolved object  ( fig.7 in  kw11 )",
