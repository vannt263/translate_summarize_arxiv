    "the weak neutral current ( wnc ) was the primary prediction to be tested in the electroweak @xmath1 standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the flavor - conserving structure of the wnc has been verified with high precision in many processes @xcite . in the sm , there are no flavor changing neutral couplings ( fcnc ) mediated by the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 gauge bosons nor the higgs boson @xmath5 at tree level because the fermions are rotated from gauge to mass eigenstates by unitary diagonalization matrices @xcite . furthermore , the top - quark fcnc induced by radiative effects are also highly suppressed @xcite : the higher order contributions induced by the charged currents are proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the masses of the quarks circulating in the loop and @xmath8 is the @xmath9 gauge boson mass . as a consequence , in the sm all top - quark fcnc transitions @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , which involve down - type quarks in the loops ,",
    "are suppressed far below the observable level at existing or upcoming high energy colliders @xcite .",
    "for example , in the @xmath12 transitions the scale of the respective partial widths is set by the @xmath13 quark mass @xcite , ( tv_ic ) = |v_bc|^2 _ i m_t ( ) ^4 ( 1 - ) where @xmath14 is the respective coupling for each gauge boson @xmath15 . from the above result , it follows the approximated branching ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath18 transitions the leading contribution is proportional to @xmath19 and thus the gim mechanism @xcite induces in this case an enhancement factor . in a similar way",
    ", it has been realized that some top - quark fcnc decay modes can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in scenarios beyond the sm , and some of them falling within the lhc s reach . in this case , the enhancement arises either from a large virtual mass or from the couplings involved in the loop .",
    "top - quark fcnc processes may thus serve as a window for probing effects induced by new physics .",
    "the absence of the vertex htc at tree - level in the sm can be traced down to the presence of only one higgs doublet .",
    "the process involved in the diagonalization of the fermion masses induces simultaneously diagonal yukawa couplings for the physical higgs boson . in models with more than one higgs doublet , additional conditions have to be imposed to ensure that no fcnc arise at tree level .",
    "in particular , a discrete symmetry that makes quarks of same charge to interact with only one of the two ( or more ) higgs doublets will , by the glashow - weinberg mechanism , cause all the yukawa couplings involving physical neutral higgs boson states become diagonal@xcite . on the other hand , without any fcnc suppression mechanism these type of models may produce @xmath20 couplings at tree level , which in turn may induce large enhancements of the fcnc @xmath21 by radiative effects @xcite .",
    "the interest in fcnc top - quark physics is expected to increase since processes involving top and higgs fcnc will be examined with significant precision at both the lhc and ilc . in the first case , with a lhc luminosity of @xmath22 ,",

    "the goal of the present review is to bring together much of what is currently known on top - quark fcnc .",
    "we will concentrate on the predictions made by different extensions of the sm as well as the constraints imposed on these couplings from low - energy precision measurements .",
    "the physics associated to the production mechanisms of the processes induced by the top - quark fcnc at future accelerators have been surveyed in several reviews @xcite and will not be considered here .",
    "our interest is to compare the predictions on the top - quark fcnc made by the following models : susy , two - higgs doublets models ( thdm ) , top - color assisted technicolor , left - right symmetric models , 331 models , and models with extra quark singlets or extra sequential quarks .",
    "we will introduce first the sm predictions , and then we will address each one of these models in the following sections",

    ", each known particle has a superpartner that differs in spin by 1/2 and is related to the original particle by a susy transformation .",
    "however , susy must be a broken symmetry .",
    "otherwise , the masses of all new superpartners would be equal to the known particle spectrum .",
    "therefore , the effective lagrangian at the electroweak scale is expected to be parameterized by a general set of susy - breaking terms if the attractive features of susy are to be a part of the physics beyond the sm .",
    "this version of susy is known as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the source of flavor violation in the mssm arises from the possible misalignment between the rotations that diagonalize the quark and squark sectors .",

    "however , they are still below the estimated sensitivity at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath131 ( see eq .",

    "similar results were obtained in a mssm with a light right - handed top - squark and a large mixing between the first or second and the third generation of up - squarks  @xcite .",
    "recently , the fcnc top - quark decays have been re - analyzed in the so - called unconstrained mssm  @xcite , where the assumptions on the soft breaking terms are relaxed and new sources of flavor violation appear in the sfermions mass matrices . in this case",
    "the neutralino-@xmath125 and gluino-@xmath125 couplings induce larger contributions to the fcnc processes : @xmath129 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , with the last one probably measurable at the lhc  @xcite .",

[ lhcsensitivity ] ) .    on the other hand , while the @xmath137 decay is the less favored channel in the sm  @xcite , it is this fcnc channel which shows the most dramatic enhancements due to new physics effects .",
    "in some susy extensions its br can be ten orders of magnitude larger than the sm prediction .",
    "this possibility arises not only because in some models the fcnc vertex tch can be generated at tree level , but also because the gim suppression does not apply in some loops .",
    "in particular , the gluino - mediated fcnc couplings @xmath138 induces a @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the lightest cp - even higgs boson predicted in the mssm  @xcite . the branching fraction for this channel has been also found to be as large as @xmath141 in a minimal susy fcnc scenario in which all the observable fcnc effects come from squark mixings @xmath142 induced by the non - diagonal scalar trilinear interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out recently that the electroweak precision measurements may impose constraints on this squark mixing ; which in turn decrease the mssm prediction for the fcnc top quark processes  @xcite .",
    "if r - parity violation is included in the mssm , @xmath96 receives new contributions from the loops with an exchange of a single sparticle that involves the third generation of fermions . as a consequence , the mass suppression is less severe than in the purely mssm  @xcite . in this case",
    "the respective branching ratio can be as high as @xmath143 in some part of the parameter space .",
    "it should be mentioned that in all these cases , the @xmath144 falls off quickly for heavier sparticles in the loops .",
    "the occurrence of tree - level fcnc has also been studied in supersymmetric multi - higgs doublet models  @xcite .",
    "as expected , it was found that the matrices which diagonalize the quark mass matrices do not , in general , diagonalize also the corresponding yukawa couplings . as a consequence",
    ", both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs - quark - quark interactions may exhibit a strong non - diagonality in flavor space .",
    "for example , one - loop contributions to low - energy observables require a higgs spectrum at least of order 10 tev in order to suppress appreciably fcnc of light quarks  @xcite .",
    "in technicolor theories , the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism arises from a new , strongly coupled gauge interaction at tev energy scales  @xcite .",
    "quark and lepton mass matrices appear from the embedding of technicolor in a larger gauge theory , extended technicolor  @xcite , which must be broken sequentially from energies of order @xmath145 tev down to the 1 tev level .",

    "fcnc top - quark decays have been studied in the alternative lr symmetric model  @xcite , which is a new formulation of these models with an enlarged fermion sector : it includes vector - like heavy fermions in order to explain the fermionic mass hierarchy . because of the presence of extra quarks , the ckm mass matrix is not unitary and fcnc may exists at tree level .",

    ", there would remain still the question to clear up the nature of the virtual effects involved in the enhancement of the respective fcnc decay . on the other hand ,",
    "if no new physics effect is ever found in this search , an improvement on the experimental bounds of fcnc top quark decays will provide a critical test of the validity of the sm at the loop level .",
