    "the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of a lepton on the nucleon represents an important tool for studying strong interaction .",
    "the possibility of representing a semi - inclusive hadron leptoproduction ( sihl ) cross section as a convolution of the virtual photon absorption by the quarks inside the nucleon and the subsequent quark hadronization allows one to investigate these mechanisms separately .",
    "the sihl experiment provides not only complete information on the longitudinal parton momentum distributions available in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments , but also an insight on the hadronization process and on parton orbital momenta .",
    "it is well known that sihl events are altered by the real photon emission from the lepton and hadron legs as well as by additional virtual particle contributions .",
    "due to i ) the fact that most of the outgoing particles in sihl remain undetected and ii ) the finite resolution of experimental equipment , not all events with the real photon emission can be removed experimentally . moreover",
    ", the contribution of events with an additional exchange of virtual particles can not be removed at all . as a result",
    "the measured sihl cross section includes not only the lowest order contribution which is the process of interest ( fig .",
    "[ gr ]  ( a ) ) , but also the higher order effects whose contribution has to be removed from the data .",
    "since the latter can not be extracted by experimental methods , the corresponding radiative corrections ( rc ) have to be calculated theoretically .",
    "the primary step in the solution of the task on rc calculation in the lepton nucleon scattering assumes the calculation of the part of the total lowest order qed correction that includes real photon emission from lepton leg as well as the additional virtual photon between the initial and final leptons and the correction due to virtual photon self - energy .",
    "there are two basic reasons for why other types of rc , such as box - type contribution or real photon emission from hadrons , are less important .",
    "the first is that these corrections do not contain the leading order contribution which is proportional to the logarithm of the lepton mass , and therefore , their contribution is much smaller comparing to rc from lepton part .",
    "the second is that the calculation of these effects requires additional assumptions about hadron interaction , so it has additional pure theoretical uncertainties , which are hardly controlled .    in the very first detailed sihl experiments  @xcite rc were unknown and monte carlo simulations based on the approach from ref .",
    "@xcite were used to correct the data .",
    "the results of this monte carlo method however , have not been tested so far against the direct calculations of radiative effects . meanwhile",
    "most experiments at high energies @xcite neglected rc completely @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the lepton part of the lowest order qed rc to sihl cross sections were performed in refs .",

    "@xcite the radiative effects were calculated for the three - dimensional cross section of unpolarized and polarized sihl ( target and lepton were longitudinally polarized ) and the fortran code for numerical estimates was provided as a patch ( named sirad ) to polrad code  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite rc for the unpolarized five - fold differential cross section have been computed and fortran code haprad has been developed .",
    "however in both papers , rc do not include the contribution of the radiative tail from the exclusive reaction at the threshold .",
    "in inclusive dis experiments analogous effects from the elastic radiative tail @xcite give an important contribution to the observable cross section and , moreover , there exist kinematic regions ( e.g. at high @xmath0 or @xmath1 and small @xmath2 ) , where this contribution is dominant .",
    "this additional term of rc to sihl has been investigated until now only in the peaking approximation @xcite .",

    "the rest of the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define kinematics of the investigated processes , obtain explicit expressions for the contribution of exclusive radiative tail to the five - fold differential cross section of sihl , and investigate its analytical properties considering the soft photon limit .",
