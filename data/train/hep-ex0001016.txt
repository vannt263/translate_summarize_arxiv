    "previous measurements of w@xmath5w@xmath3 production at lep have concentrated on measurements of the w mass , the w branching ratios , the differential and total cross sections and the anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "these measurements show , using the differential cross sections with respect to the w production and decay angles , good agreement with theoretical calculations within the standard model  @xcite .",
    "this good agreement with the standard model indicates indirectly that w bosons with all three helicities are produced in the reaction @xmath6 .",
    "the primary goal of the measurement described in this paper is a quantitative and model independent analysis of all three w helicity states and in particular , the direct observation of longitudinally polarised w bosons .",
    "measurements of longitudinally polarised w bosons have previously been reported in the reaction @xmath6",
    "@xcite and in top decays  @xcite .    at center  of  mass energies close to 190 gev and within the standard model",
    ", one expects that about one quarter of all w bosons should be longitudinally polarised  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the production of w bosons with different helicities depends strongly on the w@xmath3 scattering angle @xmath7 with respect to the e@xmath3 beam direction .",
    "for example one expects for @xmath7 larger than 90 degrees that almost 40% of the events contain at least one longitudinally polarised w boson .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath7 between 20 and 70 degrees , the cross section is dominated by the neutrino  exchange diagram and the w@xmath5w@xmath3 should be produced dominantly with transverse polarisation .",
    "the fractions of the w@xmath0 helicity states should thus also be measured as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the measurement is performed with the l3 detector at lep , using data samples of 55.5 pb@xmath8 and 176.4 pb@xmath8 collected at average center  of  mass energies of 183 and 189 , respectively .",
    "a detailed description of the l3 detector and its performance is given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the l3 detector response for w@xmath5w@xmath3 events from the koralw  @xcite and the eeww  @xcite monte carlo programs is simulated with the geant  based l3 detector simulation program  @xcite .",
    "the different w helicity states result in different angular distributions of the w decay products . the decay angle @xmath9 in the w rest frame between the left  handed negatively charged lepton and the w@xmath3 has a @xmath10 distribution for a w@xmath3 with helicity @xmath11 .",
    "the right  handed positively charged lepton has a @xmath10 distribution for a w@xmath5 with helicity @xmath12 .",
    "longitudinally polarised w bosons ( helicity @xmath13 ) result in a symmetric distribution of the decay products , proportional to @xmath14 . to simplify the description of the helicity fractions , we refer in the following text only to the fractions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the w@xmath3 helicities , which includes the corresponding w@xmath5 states with @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , respectively .    in order to study the w polarisation ,",
    "we use events of the type @xmath18 with @xmath19 being either e@xmath0 or @xmath20 .",
    "the neutrino four  momentum vector is reconstructed from the total missing momentum vector of the event .",
    "these event samples are essentially background free and allow a measurement with good accuracy of the w@xmath0 momentum vector , the w charge and the decay angle @xmath9 in the w rest frame .    in contrast to leptonic w decays ,",
    "where the decay angle @xmath21 of the @xmath22 is well defined , the corresponding @xmath23 for quarks in w decays has to be calculated from the hadronic decay products . to approximate the quark decay angle in the w rest frame , we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , all particles besides the charged lepton and the missing neutrino in the event are associated with the hadronic decay of the w. we then calculate their associated four  vectors in the rest frame of the w and determine the corresponding thrust axis in this rest frame .",
    "the angle @xmath24 of this thrust axis with respect to the w momentum vector in the laboratory frame is used to describe the quark decay angle @xmath23 in the w rest frame .    after correcting for efficiencies ,",
    "the contributions from different w polarisation states are obtained from a fit to the @xmath25 distributions . for the leptonic",
    "w decays the fractions @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 of the three w helicity states are obtained from :    @xmath26    for hadronic w decays , without quark charge identification , one measures only the absolute value of the w hadronic decay angle @xmath27 .",
    "however , this distribution can still be used to measure the fractions for the sum of the two transverse helicity states @xmath28 and @xmath16 using :    @xmath29    the predictions for the compositions of w helicity states as a function of the w@xmath3 scattering angle @xmath7 , following the formalism of hagiwara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and its implementation in the koralw monte carlo program  @xcite , are used as the standard model prediction for our analysis .",
    "the helicity composition of the total w sample is extracted from a fit to the distribution of the simulated decay angles . from a fit to a koralw monte carlo event sample at @xmath2=189 , with a size 100 times larger than the data sample , the standard model predictions for inclusive w helicity fractions @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 are obtained to be 56.3% , 18.0% and 25.7% , respectively .",
    "the statistical errors are smaller than 0.5% .    within the statistical errors ,",
    "the same fractions are found from a ww event sample generated with the eeww monte carlo program  @xcite which uses the zero total w width approximation and assigns the w helicities on an event by event basis .",
    "the w helicity fractions obtained from the fit to the decay angle distributions agree , within statistical errors smaller than 0.9% , with the generated w helicity fractions .",
    "this shows that the born level formul ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are applicable after radiative corrections .",
    "the selection of @xmath31 events is similar to the selections described in our previous publications on ww final states  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to assure well measured w production and decay angles , more restrictive criteria are used .",
    "charged leptons are identified using their characteristic signatures .",
    "electrons are identified as isolated energy depositions in the electromagnetic calorimeter with electromagnetic shower shape which are matched in azimuth to a track reconstructed in the central tracking chamber .",
    "the energy and direction of electrons are measured using the electromagnetic calorimeter , while the charge is obtained from the associated track .",
    "muons are identified and measured with tracks reconstructed in the muon chambers which point back to the interaction vertex .",
    "all other energy depositions in the calorimeters are assumed to originate from the hadronic w decay .",
    "the neutrino momentum vector is set equal to the total missing momentum vector of the event .",
    "in addition the following criteria are used for the selection of @xmath31 events :    * the reconstructed momentum should be greater than 20 for electrons and 15 for muons .",
    "* the momentum of the neutrino should be greater than 10 and its polar angle , @xmath32 , has to satisfy @xmath33 . * the invariant mass of the @xmath34 system should be greater than 60 .",
    "* the invariant mass of the hadronic system should be between 50 and 110 .    using these criteria ,",
    "81 and 288 events of the type @xmath35 are selected at center  of  mass energies of 183 and 189 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding event numbers for @xmath36 are 67 and 262 events . adding the electron and muon event samples together , we find 68 and 280 @xmath37 events and 80 and 270 @xmath38 events , respectively , in the 183 and 189 data samples .",
    "these samples have a purity of 96% , where the background from @xmath39 with leptonic @xmath40 decays and the background from @xmath41 hadrons contribute each about 2% .",
    "the measured @xmath42 distribution is found to be in good agreement with the mc expectations , as shown in figure  [ fig : wwpol1 ] for events with electrons and with muons for the 189 data sample .",
    "about 5% of the accepted events with electron candidates have a wrongly assigned charge .",
    "charge confusion is insignificant for events with muons .",
    "the charge confusion depends on the reconstructed w@xmath3 scattering angle and is largest for w bosons with small scattering angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "this results in a small misassignment between w bosons with helicity + 1 and 1 but has negligible effects for the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons , which is essentially independent of the charge assignment .",
    "after subtracting the backgrounds from the data , the fractions of the w helicity states are measured from the distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the leptonic and hadronic w decay angle and as a function of the scattering angle @xmath7 .    to extract the w helicity fractions , the observed distributions",
    "are corrected for the selection efficiencies which are obtained as a function of @xmath25 . to take into account possible deviations between the helicity fractions in the data and monte carlo as a function of @xmath42 ,",
    "the data are corrected differentially using 9 bins of the @xmath42 scattering angle . for each @xmath42 bin ,",
    "the efficiency is obtained as a function of @xmath25 using the ratio of the reconstructed and the generated @xmath25 distributions for the leptonic and hadronic w decays .",
    "the measured @xmath25 distributions for the corresponding @xmath42 bins in the data are corrected and combined .",
    "the efficiency corrections are obtained from large samples of fully simulated koralw monte carlo events . using these monte carlo events",
    "we have studied the accuracy with which we reconstruct the @xmath9 decay angles .",
    "the study shows that @xmath9 is reconstructed with a standard deviation of 9.2 degrees and a small shift of @xmath453.2 degrees for the leptonic w decays . for hadronic",
    "w decays one finds that @xmath9 is reconstructed with a standard deviation of 12.0 degrees and a shift of @xmath463.3 degrees .",
    "the bias and sensitivity loss due to the efficiency corrections and the @xmath9 resolution has been determined with fully simulated and reconstructed monte carlo events where the generated w helicity fractions have been varied over a large range .",
    "this was done both with the eeww monte carlo program , where the generated w helicities are known on an event by event basis and with the koralw monte carlo using a weighting method to assign the w helicities on a statistical basis , ignoring w spin correlations .",
    "averaging both monte carlo estimates one finds that leptonic w decays with 100% helicity @xmath47 states would be measured to consist of 94% of helicity @xmath47 and 6% helicity @xmath13 states while a w sample with 100% helicity @xmath48 would be reconstructed to consist of more than 99% of helicity @xmath48 states .",
    "similar numbers are found if one starts with 100% helicity @xmath13 , which would be measured with 92% helicity @xmath13 , 3% helicity @xmath47 and 5% helicity @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for hadronic w decays are that 94% of w bosons with helicity @xmath12 and 85% of w bosons with helicity @xmath13 are correctly reconstructed .",
    "the study has been repeated as a function of @xmath42 and within the statistical errors the results are the same as the ones from the total w sample . to obtain a correction function for the bias and the efficiency loss ,",
    "the fraction @xmath16 has been varied between 0 and 100% . a linear relation between the generated and the fitted w helicity fractions is found .",
    "these efficiency corrected @xmath25 distributions are used to extract the w@xmath0 helicity fractions .",
    "the results of the binned @xmath49 fits to these distributions for leptonic and hadronic w decays from the @xmath2=189 data are shown in figure  [ fig : wwpol2 ] .",
    "no constraint on the total cross section is applied and one finds that the data are well described only if all three w helicity states are used in the fit .",
    "fits which include only @xmath47 and @xmath12 helicities , as also shown in figure 2 , fail to describe the data . for leptonic",
    "w decays one finds that the @xmath49 increases from 7.1 for seven degrees of freedom if all three w helicity states are included to 17.8 for eight degrees of freedom if only helicity @xmath47 and @xmath48 are used to describe the data . for hadronic",
    "w decays the @xmath49 increases from 9.8 for eight degrees of freedom if all three w helicity states are included to 26.4 for nine degrees of freedom if only helicity @xmath12 are used to describe the data .",
    "the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons in the @xmath2=189 data is measured to be 0.220@xmath40.077 for the leptonic decays and 0.285@xmath40.084 for hadronic decays .",
    "the fractions for the different w helicity states , together with the standard model monte carlo expectations , are given in table 1 for the @xmath2=189 and @xmath2=183 data .",
    "the observed fractions of longitudinally polarised w bosons measured with leptonic and hadronic w decays agree with each other and with the standard model expectation of 0.26 and differ from zero by several standard deviations .",
    "systematic studies have been performed to verify the stability of the fit results with respect to the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons .",
    "we have investigated ( 1 ) uncertainties due to backgrounds , ( 2 ) efficiencies and selection criteria , ( 3 ) the hadron energy response functions of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , ( 4 ) the difference between the differential and overall efficiency corrections and ( 5 ) a method where the fraction @xmath16 has been obtained directly from a fit to the measured @xmath25 distributions using the monte carlo shape from the different w helicity states after the reconstruction .",
    "the analysis has been repeated assuming large relative background uncertainies of @xmath4 50% from either the hadronic background or from misidentified w@xmath50 decays . using these modifications the measured fractions of longitudinally polarised w bosons",
    "is found to vary by at most 0.012 for leptonic w decays and by 0.004 for the hadronic w decays .",
    "the hadron energy measurement is obtained from a combination of the energy deposited in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeter multiplied by calibration constants which take the average calorimeter e@xmath0/hadron response function into account .",
    "these calibration constants have been varied over a wide range while demanding that the average of the reconstructed masses for leptonic and hadronic w decays agree within better than @xmath4 3 with an average w mass of 80.4 . since the neutrino momentum vector is reconstructed from the observed missing momentum vector ,",
    "correlations exist between the reconstructed decay angles in the hadronic w system and the corresponding leptonic w system .",
    "for example , a particular choice of the energy calibration constants reduces the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons by 0.024 as seen with the leptonic w decays but increases the corresponding fraction for the hadronic decays by 0.015 .",
    "similar variations in the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons have been seen with the other systematic studies , as summarised in table 2 .",
    "assuming that the variations given in table 2 are all due to systematics and adding them in quadrature , a systematic error of @xmath40.034 , @xmath40.024 and @xmath40.016 is assigned to the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons measured with leptonic , hadronic decays and for the combined measurement , respectively .    combining the results from the @xmath51 183 and 189 , ignoring the slight energy dependence of the w helicity fractions expected from the standard model , the fraction of longitudinally polarised w bosons",
    "is measured to be    @xmath52    and agrees with expectation from the standard model of 0.26 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is interesting to measure the w helicity fractions as a function of the w@xmath3 scattering angle @xmath7 . thus the fits are repeated for different ranges of @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath42 ranges are selected such that the contributions from the transversely polarised w bosons should be either suppressed or enhanced as shown in figures  [ fig : wwpol3 ] and  [ fig : wwpol4 ] .    to obtain quantitative numbers for the w helicity fractions as a function of @xmath42 the data from the two different center  of",
    " mass energies are combined and the helicity fractions are measured for three bins of @xmath42 .",
    "the bins are chosen such that large variations of the different helicity fractions are expected @xcite yet keeping a sufficient statistical significance .",
    "the results , given in table 3 , agree with the standard model expectations and demonstrate that the fraction of w bosons with helicity @xmath47 depends on the w scattering angle as shown in figure  [ fig : wwpol5 ] .    in summary , all three w boson helicity states , the two transverse as well as the longitudinal ones",
    "are observed with fractions in agreement with standard model expectations .",
    "the production of longitudinally polarised w bosons is thus directly observed with a significance of five standard deviations .",
    "we would like to thank f. jegerlehner , z. kunszt , z. was and d. zeppenfeld for interesting discussions about the physics of ww production .",
    "we also wish to express our gratitude to the cern accelerator divisions for the excellent performance of the lep machine .",
    "we acknowledge the contributions of the engineers and technicians who have participated in the construction and maintenance of this experiment .",
