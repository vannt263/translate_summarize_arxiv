    "our understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been revolutionized by the discovery of x - ray afterglows by bepposax ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the following detections of optical transients ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these efforts led eventually to a confirmation of the cosmological nature of grbs , through both direct redshift measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) , and imaging of the host galaxies ( e.g. sahu et  al .",
    "the enormous power released in the explosion implies extremely large compactness of the source and , therefore , most grb models involve compact or collapsed objects ( e.g. @xcite ; see mszros 1999 for a review ) . in spite of the impressive successes of expanding relativistic `` fireball '' models ( e.g.@xcite ;",
    "see @xcite for review ) , the precise nature of grb progenitors remains unknown .",
    "the total energy emitted in the grb explosion and the rate at which such explosions occur in the universe are important keys to the understanding of the progenitors .",
    "the determination of these factors is complicated , however , by virtue of relativistic beaming . during the phase of @xmath0-ray emission the fireball expands with a large lorentz factor , @xmath6 , so that a distant observer receives radiation from a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath7 around the line of sight .",
    "thus , estimates of total energy and rate based on @xmath0-ray observations are highly uncertain . the first evidence that the fireball may be jetted was provided by radio observations of grb970508 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations imply a jet of relatively wide opening angle , which expands sideways and approaches sub - relativistic , spherical expansion @xmath8  yr following the grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of radio observations during the sub - relativistic phase allowed to determine the total grb energy to be @xmath9  erg . jetted grbs have been widely invoked to explain the optical light curves of the afterglow emission , most notably so for the source grb990123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have analyzed a sample of grb afterglows with known redshifts .",
    "they find that most bursts are jetted , with jet opening angle @xmath10 and average `` beaming factor , '' defined as @xmath11 , of @xmath12 .",
    "they also find that the total @xmath0-ray energy release , when corrected for beaming as inferred from the afterglow light curves , is narrowly clustered around @xmath13  erg .",
    "this result , although somewhat model dependent , also suggests that the conversion efficiency of fireball kinetic energy to radiation is high , in agreement with the conclusion of freedman & waxman ( 2001 ) , who derived total fireball energy using early x - ray afterglow data .",
    "the energy estimates of frail et al .",
    "are in agreement with those derived by freedman & waxman , and also with the total energy derived for grb970508 ( @xcite ) .    using radio surveys to constrain grb beaming , rate and energetics through the search for radio emission from grbs",
    "that were not necessarily detected in @xmath0-rays , has been proposed by perna & loeb ( 1998 ) , woods & loeb ( 1999 ) and by paczyski ( 2001 ) .",
    "perna & loeb have suggested to search for such `` orphan radio afterglow '' emission from grb jets pointing toward us , while woods & loeb have suggested to look for @xmath14  yr old , non - relativistic remnants .",
    "paczyski suggested , based on the radio observations of grb970508 , to search for emission from @xmath3  yr old nearby grb remnants , which have undergone the transition from a relativistic jet to spherical sub - relativistic expansion , during which emission is isotropic .",
    "given the hints for an association of grbs with supernovae ( @xcite ) , it was suggested by paczyski to search for strong radio emitters among nearby supernovae . in this paper",
    "we use the model , proposed in ( @xcite ) for the long term radio afterglow emission of grbs , to calculate the expected number of orphan afterglows in radio surveys .",
    "we find that the detectable orphan population is dominated by @xmath3  yr old grb remnants which have just undergone the transition to sub - relativistic , spherical expansion .",
    "we determine the dependence of the expected number of sources on uncertain model parameters , derive a lower limit to the expected number of sources , and demonstrate that independent constraints on the beaming factor of early grb emission can be imposed using radio surveys .",
    "we searched for point - like radio transients , by comparing the first and nvss wide field catalogues , taken a few years apart , looking for sources present in one catalogue and absent in the other .",
    "our approach is different than that proposed by paczyski , namely we look directly for radio transients without relying on an association with nearby supernovae , since the link between grbs and luminous supernovae is not well established : the only clear case , 1998bw , had an atypical ( very weak ) grb , while there are three low redshift , @xmath15 , grbs with no prominent supernova reported . in ",
    "2 we provide a brief description of the afterglow model and its main results used in later sections . in ",
    "3 we calculate the number of radio afterglows expected to be detected above a certain flux . in   4",
    "we present a search for point - like radio transients using the first and nvss catalogs , and discuss possible contamination by radio supernovae and agn .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in   5 .",
    "the basic model assumes an ultra - relativistic , jet like ejecta propagating into an ambient medium of density @xmath16 , slowing down and expanding sideways , ultimately becoming non - relativistic . as long as the jet lorentz factor",
    "@xmath17 is larger than the inverse of the jet s opening angle @xmath1 , it behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball .",
    "once @xmath17 drops below @xmath18 , the jet expands sideways , and its behavior deviates from that exhibited in the conical phase ( @xcite ) . after a transition stage ,",
    "in which the jet expands sideways , the flow approaches spherical symmetry and becomes sub - relativistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transition from a jet to a spherical sub - relativistic evolution takes place over a time scale , @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , @xmath20 is the total energy carried by the jet , in units of @xmath21  erg , corrected for beaming , i.e. it is related to the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath22 by @xmath23 , where @xmath1 is the jet opening angle .",
    "the subscript snt refers to the sedov - von neumann - taylor self - similar solution that describes the sub - relativistic flow .",
    "after the transition , the power is dominated by synchrotron emission from a sub - relativistic fireball ( e.g.  frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) . denoting by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) the fraction of thermal energy behind the shock that is carried by electrons ( magnetic field ) , and assuming that the electrons are accelerated to a power - law energy distribution , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , it can be shown ( @xcite ) that the flux at frequencies above the synchrotron peak frequency at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is given by ( see also appendix of frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) @xmath30^{-9/10}\\,{\\rm mjy}~~. \\label{eq : f_nu}\\ ] ] here",
    ", @xmath31 is the luminosity distance , @xmath32 cm , and @xmath33 is the observed frequency measured in ghz .",
    "analysis of grb970508 radio data implies ( @xcite ) @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "consider a survey with a flux threshold denoted by @xmath36 , and denote by @xmath37 the time , in units of @xmath38 , at which the radio flux of a grb at a given luminosity distance , @xmath31 , drops below detection limit . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_nu ] ) we then obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40    we shall assume , in what follows , that the total energy output and beaming factor of grbs are standard and , moreover , that the fraction of total energy release that goes into driving the external blast wave generating the afterglow emission , is the same for all grbs .",
    "we make this assumption in order to simplify our analysis , and since the distribution of the above parameters is not well known .",
    "it is important to emphasize at this point that , as mentioned above , the analysis presented in frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) indicates that the distribution of grb true ( i.e. corrected for beaming ) gamma - ray energies is narrowly clustered around @xmath41 , with a corresponding average beaming factor of @xmath42 .",
    "these results also imply high , order unity , radiative efficiency , consistent with the result obtained by freedman & waxman ( 2001 ) using a different method , and implying that the true total fireball energy is a few times @xmath43 , i.e. narrowly peaked around @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we expect corrections to our results , due to deviations of parameters from their standard values , to be small . moreover , our results , given as explicit functions of the standard parameter values , can be easily generalized to the case where parameter values are drawn from a general distribution , by replacing these values with their corresponding averages .",
    "let @xmath45 be the time at which the radio source just becomes isotropic .",
    "then for a given flux threshold , the maximum luminosity distance below which a substantial number of sources can be detected is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) for @xmath46 : @xmath47 for a given choice of grb parameters , a flux threshold @xmath48 at the observed frequency @xmath33 , and value of @xmath49 , the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath45 are fixed . equation ( [ dl ] ) can then be numerically solved for the assumed cosmology to yield the maximum redshift @xmath51 encompassed by the survey .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the observed number of grb events per year per gpc@xmath53 at @xmath54 ( which , assuming that the grb rate follows the redshift evolution of the star formation , is estimated to be @xmath55 ( @xcite ) ) , and by @xmath56 the redshift evolution factor .",
    "the expected number of radio afterglows between @xmath57 and @xmath58 can then be expressed as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the light distance in units of @xmath61 , and @xmath62 the total number expected , @xmath63 , can be obtained by integrating eq ( [ dn ] ) from @xmath54 to @xmath64 , with @xmath65 determined from eq . ( [ dl ] ) .    as an example , consider a survey with a flux threshold of 5 mjy .",
    "assuming @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the above choice for the remaining parameters , we find @xmath68 gpc , and a corresponding redshit @xmath69 . at such",
    "small redshifts cosmological effects can be neglected to a reasonable approximation , and the luminosity distance can be taken to be equal to the proper distance . in this case",
    "( [ dn ] ) can be integrated analytically .",
    "one then finds , using @xmath70 @xmath71 as seen , @xmath63 depends only weakly on @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , any uncertainty in the time at which the radio emission becomes roughly isotropic should not affect our result considerably .",
    "we have also given the result in terms of the isotropic equivalent energy , @xmath22 , for which we have chosen a normalization of @xmath72  erg , since for the sample of grbs with known redshifts given in frail et al .",
    "2001 , one finds @xmath73  erg and @xmath74  erg . since the true energy inferred from the observations , which is constrained by the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath75 measured in grbs with known redshifts , is inversely proportional to the beaming factor , @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the number of orphans expected to be detected in a flux limited survey decreases with increasing beaming factor , unless the survey is sufficiently deep to detect all sources .",
    "this is , of course , due to the fact that larger beaming factor implies , for given isotropic equivalent energy , a lower true energy , and hence a lower radio flux at the transition to spherical expansion , as demonstrated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_nu ] ) .",
    "the number of orphan radio grbs , eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , depends on the model parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "afterglow observations strongly suggest that @xmath24 is close to equipartition , i.e. @xmath79 ( freedman & waxman 2001 ) , and that @xmath77 is narrowly peaked around @xmath80 ( frail et al .",
    "the main uncertainty is thus in the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath25 .",
    "the peak flux of a grb afterglow , for an observer lying along the jet axis , is proportional to @xmath81 , and for typical luminosity distance of @xmath82  cm it is @xmath83  mjy ( @xcite ) .",
    "observed afterglow fluxes generally imply @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and values @xmath86 are obtained in several cases ( e.g. @xcite ) . our parameter choice in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , is therefore conservative .",
    "even for such a conservative choice of parameters we expect more than a dozen radio afterglows to be detected by an all sky survey like the nvss , provided the beaming factor is not much larger than that anticipated from other considerations .",
    "note , that our choice @xmath89 is also conservative : if the grb rate does not evolve with redshift , rather than following the star formation rate , the @xmath54 rate is about 8 times larger , @xmath90 , and the expected number of radio grb remnants is correspondingly larger by the same factor .",
    "finally , the brightest source should have a flux of @xmath91 since the flux in this phase declines roughly as @xmath92 , such a source should remain above 1 mjy for at least several years .",
    "this motivates follow - up observations of the brightest transients found in a survey .    the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) does not take into account the contribution from sources having a lifetime shorter than @xmath93 .",
    "these sources are expected to be beamed , and so the fraction that can be observed ( those directed along our sight line ) should be of course correspondingly smaller . on the other hand , the radio flux emitted at times earlier than @xmath93 is larger and , consequently , these beamed sources can be seen out to a larger distance .",
    "we may estimate the number of beamed radio sources anticipated to be detected by the survey using the following argument .",
    "the ratio of the number of sources having an opening angle @xmath94 that are pointing in our direction , to the number of sources that had just become isotropic , is given by @xmath95 $ ] for a two sided jet , where @xmath96 is the observed expansion time to opening angle @xmath1 : @xmath97 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "noting that the radio flux measured by an observer within the beam drops as @xmath98 during the expansion of the jet ( e.g. @xcite ) , the flux of a beamed source is higher than that of a source that just became spherical ( lying at the same distance ) by a factor @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that beamed sources can be seen out to a distance larger by a factor @xmath100 compared to those that just became spherical .",
    "thus , the ratio of the number of beamed sources to those that just became spherical , observed above a certain flux , is @xmath101\\propto\\theta^3 $ ] .",
    "thus , the number of detectable sources is dominated by sources which have already expanded to spherical symmetry .    for deeper surveys cosmological effects can not be ignored and must be taken into account .",
    "we have solved eqs .",
    "( [ dl ] ) and ( [ dn ] ) numerically for different choices of cosmological parameters .",
    "for the range of parameters presently favorable we find that @xmath63 depends only weakly on the assumed cosmology . in the following",
    "we present the results obtained for @xmath67 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "we also made the popular assumption that the comoving grb density distribution traces the star formation rate , and invoked a strong redshift evolution for the later , as suggested by madau & pozetti ( 2000 ) .",
    "specifically , we take @xmath104 in the following calculations .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) is depicted in fig 1a , where the dependence of the maximum redshift @xmath51 on @xmath105 is plotted .",
    "1b shows the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath50 for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "for the cosmology adopted above , the radio flux of a source at a redshift of @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 and is smaller by a factor of 4 at @xmath109 .",
    "thus for our above ( conservative ) choice of afterglow parameters a flux limit of @xmath110 is required to see all the orphans if the grb population is dominated by those at @xmath111 .",
    "we conducted a search for point - like radio transients in the first radio catalog ( white et al .",
    "we searched for compact first radio sources that do not appear in the nvss radio catalog ( condon et al .",
    "the sample we obtain this way is incomplete , since it rejects afterglow sources that were detected by the nvss , and were bright enough to remain above 6 mjy during the first observation .",
    "we examine this incompleteness factor further below and show that it is smaller than 5 percent . as the first and nvss surveys were obtained in different vla configurations , the comparison was done carefully .",
    "we use this comparison to put an upper limit on the number of grb radio afterglows .",
    "the first is a 20 cm radio survey conducted using the nrao vla in b - configuration , with @xmath112 beam - size .",
    "the final maps have a typical noise rms of @xmath113  mjy .",
    "this value allows @xmath114 detection of @xmath115  mjy sources .",
    "the survey s resolution enables an astrometric accuracy better than @xmath116 ( @xmath117 cl ) .",
    "the first radio survey has begun in 1994 , and when completed it will cover @xmath118  deg@xmath119 , mostly in the north galactic cap . in the search described below , we used the first 2001 , oct 15 version , covering @xmath120  deg@xmath119 .",
    "this catalog has @xmath121 sources , hence , a density of about @xmath122 sources per deg@xmath119 .",
    "the nvss 20 cm radio survey ( condon et al . 1998 ) was conducted between 1993 to 1996 and covers all the sky north of declination @xmath123  deg .",
    "it utilized the vla d- and dnc - configurations , with a circular beam - size of @xmath124 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the median angular size ( @xmath125 ) of faint extragalactic sources . with this beam - size ,",
    "the faintest nvss sources have an astrometric accuracy better than @xmath126 ( @xmath127 cl ) .",
    "the images have rms brightness fluctuations of @xmath128  mjy  beam@xmath129 , that allows for @xmath114 detection of @xmath130  mjy sources .",
    "the nvss @xmath131 completeness level is about @xmath132  mjy .",
    "with density of @xmath133 sources per deg@xmath134 , it has total of @xmath135 radio sources",
    ".    radio sources could be intrinsically variable .",
    "therefore , using the nvss @xmath131 completeness of @xmath132  mjy as our threshold , could introduce a large number of variable sources ( e.g. , that were detected in the first survey , but were just under detection in the nvss ) into our transients list . in order to compare the two catalogs , we need to choose a flux limit that rejects most of the variable objects . we plot in figure  [ first_nvss_flux ] all first point - like sources ( above @xmath136  mjy ) with nvss counterparts .",
    "the solid line shows the location of sources for which the first flux equals the nvss flux , and the horizontal dashed line shows the nvss , @xmath131 completeness flux level ( i.e. , @xmath132  mjy ) .",
    "based on this plot we chose a threshold of @xmath137  mjy , for which the scatter around the solid line does not produce large number of false transients sources .    in the following we assumed that all the first images , were taken after the corresponding nvss images .",
    "this assumption will be examined more carefully later .",
    "unless a grb afterglow happens in a radio galaxy , it is expected to : ( i ) be a point source ; and ( ii ) be absent from the nvss . since radio galaxies are a tiny fraction of the overall galaxy population , these assumptions hold for most of the afterglow population .",
    "we selected all the first point - like sources with peak flux above @xmath137  mjy ( @xmath138 ) . from this subsample , we selected all the unresolved objects ( @xmath139 of the @xmath137  mjy subsample ) . however",
    ", some of the resolved first objects could actually be point sources , classified as resolved due to measurements errors . adopting the first size error criterion ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) , for @xmath140 of the first sources above @xmath137  mjy it is not possible to reject the hypothesis that they are point - like at the @xmath141 cl .",
    "therefore , the number of sources above @xmath137  mjy for which the point - source hypothesis could not be rejected at the @xmath142 level is @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) times larger than the number of point sources we used in our sample .",
    "we ended with a catalog of @xmath145 first point - like sources with peak flux above @xmath137  mjy .",
    "for these sources , we searched the nvss for counterpart within @xmath146 of the first position . although the nvss astrometry is better than @xmath126 , the use of such a high threshold was necessary because in cases of two ( or more ) nearby point - like radio sources , the nvss could detect only one elongated source , with its center offset by more than @xmath126 from one of the first point source positions .",
    "the search yields @xmath147 point - like first sources with peak flux above @xmath137  mjy for which there is no nvss counterpart .",
    "we examined the poss - ii @xmath77 images and the first and nvss radio maps of all these transient candidates .",

    "a large fraction of these sources are possibly : radio artifacts ; nvss non - detections due to locally high background ( e.g. , in the vicinity of bright radio source ) ; or physical phenomena other than grbs ( e.g. , agns , sne ) .",

    "( [ eq : f_nu ] ) implies that the flux during the first observation was larger than during the second observation by a factor of @xmath180 , assuming the source was near maximum flux during the first detection ( i.e. , its age was roughly @xmath181 ) .",
    "consequently , the fraction of bright afterglow sources in the nvss catalog that may be detected above 6 mjy by the first at time @xmath179 after 1996 , must be smaller than @xmath182 .",
    "the smallest time separation between the catalogs in the strips we consider is about @xmath183 months , and the largest is about @xmath184 years . taking the first detections to be uniformly distributed in time , integrating the fraction @xmath185 from @xmath186 to @xmath187 yields a total fraction of less than 5% that our search rejected .",
    "thus , we set @xmath188 .",
    "taking together all these factors , we can put a conservative @xmath169 cl upper limit of @xmath189 for the all - sky number of grb afterglows with peak specific - flux above @xmath137  mjy ( or @xmath190 for the @xmath153  mjy threshold ) .",
    "the characteristic behavior of radio supernovae ( rsne ) ( see @xcite for a recent review ) appears to be similar to the expected behavior of radio afterglows ( rgrbs ) . in particular , the radio light curve of type ii rsne rises on a characteristic time scale of @xmath191  days ( @xcite ) , comparable to @xmath181 ( see eq . [ [ tsnt ] ] ) , and has an overall similar shape to that of rgrbs following the peak .",
    "this is not at all surprising since both are produced by the same mechanism , namely a blast wave , albeit under somewhat different conditions .",
    "this similarity would render any attempt to distinguish rgrbs from rsne difficult and , therefore , motivates a careful examination of potential differences between these two classes of objects .",
    "we identify two features that may allow one to distinguish rgrbs from rsne .",
    "firstly , the radio flux is anticipated to decline smoothly with a @xmath192 dependence during the sub - relativistic phase in rgrbs , while the radio light curves seen in rsne are often much more complex .",
    "however , some rsne do show a smooth decline , and those may be confused with rgrbs .",
    "secondly , the absolute peak radio luminosity of rsne may differ considerably from the radio luminosity of the brightest rgrbs . for a typical grb",
    "the energy injected into the blast wave is @xmath193  erg , and with the above choice of parameters : @xmath194 , @xmath66 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , the rgrb luminosity density at 5  ghz is @xmath197 at a time of @xmath198  yr after the explosion .",
    "this luminosity is @xmath199 times larger than the typical peak luminosity ( of detected ) rsne , of order @xmath200 ( @xcite ) , and several times brighter than the brightest known rsne , sn1988z , which had a peak flux density of @xmath201 .",
    "this suggests that in a flux limited survey rsne and rgrbs should have a distinct redshift distribution , with rsne having preferentially smaller redshifts .",
    "we estimate below the number of rsne expected to be detected in a search of the type described in this paper for rgrbs , and compare their expected redshift distribution to that calculated for rgrbs . in order to make an accurate prediction for rsne",
    ", their ( peak ) luminosity function and the shape of the corresponding light curves must be known .",
    "unfortunately , due to the small sample of rsne presently available ( 12 type ii and 4 type i ) , and the lack of a supernova model that is capable of predicting the distribution of rsn properties , the determination of the peak luminosity function is highly uncertain .",
    "we therefore provide below a crude estimate based on the weiler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) compilation of rsne radio data . based on figure 3 of weiler et al .",
    ", we adopt a rsne peak luminosity function with equal number of rsne per logarithmic peak luminosity interval over the 5  ghz peak luminosity range @xmath202 to @xmath203 .",
    "in addition , we invoke a correlation between 5  ghz peak luminosity @xmath204 and peak time @xmath205 of the form , @xmath206 , as demonstrated in weiler et al .",
    "these assumptions hold , based on the available data , for type ii rsne . the properties of type i rsne are less certain . however , since type ii rsne dominate the ( detected ) rsne population , and since the type i rsne peak luminosities are close to the typical type ii peak luminosities , we expect our estimate below of the type ii rsne `` background '' rate to provide a ( crude ) estimate for the total rsne background .    assuming that the rsne flux drops as @xmath207 for @xmath208 , the number of 5 ghz sources on the sky above a certain flux density @xmath209 at any given time can be readily computed : @xmath210 here , @xmath211 is the rsne rate per unit volume , @xmath212 is the peak time corresponding to peak luminosity @xmath213 , and @xmath214 is the maximum distance at which a rsn can be observed , @xmath215 since the typical distances of detectable rsne are @xmath216  mpc , we have assumed euclidean geometry for the calculation above .",
    "it is also straight forward to calculate the average distance of detected rsne , @xmath217 these distances should be compared with those obtained for rgrbs : for the conservative grb parameters quoted above , the maximum and average distances of rgrbs detectable above 5  mjy at 5  ghz are @xmath218  mpc and @xmath219  mpc respectively .    using the above equations , and taking @xmath220 ,",
    "corresponding to the total rate of core - collapse sne ( @xcite ) , we find @xmath221 .",
    "comparing this result with the estimates for rgrbs given in  2 , we find that the number of rgrbs detected in a survey of the type described here should be at least comparable , and most likely significantly larger , than the number of detected rsne .",
    "the characteristic distances of detectable rgrbs should be @xmath222 times larger than those expected for rsne .",
    "the anticipated proximity of rsne in the first survey implies that the host galaxy should be easily detectable .",
    "in fact , even very faint galaxies should be detectable above the poss - ii limit out to a distance of 100 mpc .",
    "this means that all the radio transients listed in table 1 for which no optical counterpart is detected are unlikely to be rsne , as even dwarf hosts should be clearly evident .",
    "radio loud agns are known to exhibit large amplitude variations over a broad range of timescale and frequencies , with flare durations ranging from minutes to years .",
    "the characteristic durations of radio outbursts ( with the exception of i d variability ) are between weeks to years ( @xcite ) , with amplitudes that occasionally exceed a factor of 10 .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that some of the transients in our selected sample are radio loud agns .",
    "indeed , our initial list of 110 transients contains a number of such sources .",
    "most of the candidates in table 1 have no optical counterpart brighter than @xmath223 . what is the likeliness that some or most of them are in fact agns ?",
    "one way to characterize the radio loudness is in terms of the radio - to - optical luminosity ratio , @xmath224 , which is commonly defined using radio and optical luminosities at some fiducial rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "existing samples of agns exhibit a distribution in radio loudness that depends on selection criteria .",
    "the distribution of @xmath224 in the fbqs ( @xcite ) for example peaks at @xmath225 , with very few sources ( 0.3 % ) having @xmath226 .",
    "the distribution of radio selected quasars has a median at @xmath227 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear at present whether this is a result of a selection effect , and whether there exists a population of extremely radio loud agns .",
    "however , based on our current knowledge , we would naively expect that deep enough observations at optical wavelengths would be able to ultimately reveal the underline agn .",
    "future x - ray detections of some of our candidates will also imply that these are likely agns .",
    "a precise determination of the minimum value of @xmath224 for the objects in table 1 requires a knowledge of their redshifts , which are not available .",
    "if @xmath224 is defined as in wadadekar & kembhavi ( 1999 ) then a rough estimate yields @xmath228 for those objects .",
    "in addition , they should have no extended structure above @xmath229 on scales larger than a few arcseconds .",
    "another potential difficulty for future surveys may arise due to the presence of faint , bl lac type sources .",
    "if a population of radio bl lacs exist for which the continuum flux associated with the nuclear activity drops below that of the host galaxy during quiescent periods , then a radio transient associated with such an object may be confused with a rsn or orphan afterglow if optical observations were made when the agn was in a low state .",
    "an example is the source sdss j124602.54 which has been proposed as a candidate optical orphan afterglow , and later confirmed to be a bl lac ( @xcite ) . in order to select out such sources in future surveys , monitoring in the radio and/or optical bands",
    "may be necessary .",
    "we have calculated the number of orphan radio afterglows expected to be detected in a flux limited survey . for the grb parameters derived by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; total jet energy @xmath193  erg and average beaming factor @xmath230 , the number of sources expected to be present over all sky at any given time with flux exceeding @xmath231 is [ see eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) ] @xmath232 here @xmath52 is the grb rate at redshift @xmath54 , @xmath233 is the number density of the ambient medium into which the blast wave expands , and @xmath25 is the energy density of the magnetic field behind the shock in units of the equipartition value .",
    "@xmath52 is normalized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_r ] ) to the value obtained under the assumption that the grb rate follows the redshift evolution of star formation rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the grb rate does not evolve with redshift , @xmath52 is a factor of 8 larger than the value used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_r ] ) .",
    "since afterglow observations generally imply @xmath234 , and values @xmath235 are obtained in several cases [ see discussion in the paragraphs following eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) ] , our choice of @xmath78 and @xmath25 values are conservative .",
    "even for such a conservative choice of parameters we expect @xmath236 radio afterglows to be detected by an all sky survey with @xmath237  mjy .",
    "these sources are detected out to a distance @xmath238    we conducted a search for point - like radio transients with flux densities larger than 6 mjy using the first and nvss surveys , and discovered 25 radio afterglow candidates , listed in table 1 .",
    "the two main types of sources that may produce radio transients , which may be confused in our analysis with a radio afterglow , are radio supernovae ( rsne ) and radio loud agns . while we have shown that our candidate sources are unlikely to be rsne ( see sec . ",
    "[ sec : rsne ] ) , the possibility that most of them are radio loud agns can not be ruled out ( see sec .  [ sec : agn ] ) .",
    "thus , our detected sources allow to set an upper limit to the number of orphan radio afterglows . correcting for various completeness factors ( see sec . ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] ) , we obtained an upper limit of 447 all sky radio afterglows above 6 mjy , and 154 above 10 mjy .    we have shown that for a given isotropic equivalent burst energy , @xmath239 , the number of afterglows detected in a flux limited survey is smaller for larger beaming factor @xmath240 , i.e. for smaller jet opening angle @xmath1 [ see eq . (",
    "[ n ] ) ] .",
    "the upper limit we derived on the number of radio afterglow sources therefore implies a lower limit for the beaming factor , @xmath241 here we have used eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) with @xmath242  erg , based on grbs with known redshifts ( frail et al .",
    "this result is consistent with the value @xmath243 inferred by frail et al .",
    "better determination of the distribution of @xmath78 and @xmath25 , based on afterglow observations of identified grbs , will improve the constraint on beaming . alternatively , if the beaming factor is determined independently using other methods , then eq .",
    "( [ f > ] ) can be used to constrain the afterglow parameters .",
    "for instance , invoking @xmath243 implies @xmath244 in reality the afterglow parameters in a sample of radio grbs should have a spread , and so the letter condition may be taken as a constraint on the mean .",
    "additional observational efforts aimed at identifying the candidates in table 1 are strongly motivated by two arguments .",
    "first , some of the candidates may turn out to be orphan afterglows .",
    "the fact that most candidates in table 1 have no optical counterparts brighter than the poss - ii limit , implies that if some of them are indeed grb radio orphans then their host galaxies are not as bright as would have been expected under the assumption that grbs are associated with star - forming regions , given the distances estimated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_max ] ) for the conservative values of @xmath78 and @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , the observed number of orphan candidates is consistent with larger values of these parameters , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xibn ] ) , for which the distances are larger and the absence of optical counterparts is not surprising .",
    "second , further observations are also motivated by the fact that rejection of sources from our list in table 1 as possible candidates would impose a more stringent constraint for the beaming factor .",
    "rejection of all the sources in table 1 would imply an all sky upper limit of 49 sources , and a corresponding beaming factor @xmath5 .",
    "future radio surveys may go deeper than the first and would be of comparable or better quality .",
    "the allen telescope array ( formerly the `` 1-hectar radio telescope '' ) will allow a full coverage of the northern sky every night with @xmath3  mjy sensitivity , and the square - kilometer - array may provide even better sensitivity .",
    "a search for point - like radio transients similar to that outlined in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , would probably yield a large number of candidates .",
    "the analysis presented in ",
    "[ sec : expected ] predicts that the number of all sky radio grbs above 1 mjy is likely to lie in the range between a few hundreds and a few thousands , depending on afterglow parameters [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_r ] ) ] , provided the average beaming factor of grbs is not significantly larger than currently estimated from other considerations .",
    "since the detectable orphan population is dominated by @xmath3  yr old grb remnants , which have just undergone the transition to sub - relativistic spherical expansion , these sources should be transient , exhibiting @xmath245 flux decline on time scale of months .",
    "expansion at the speed of light over @xmath3  yr implies that the angular size of the nearby remnants , lying at a distance @xmath191  mpc , is @xmath8  mas .",
    "the nearby remnants may therefore be resolved using the vlba and , moreover , since they have just undergone the transition to spherical expansion , their structure may show significant anisotropy ( see paczyski 2001 ) .",
    "rsne and radio loud agns would probably contribute a large number of transients , and may render the identification of radio afterglows difficult . as shown in ",
    "[ sec : rsne ] , rsne and rgrbs can , in principle , be distinguished statistically by their redshift distributions . at the mjy level",
    ", the average distance of the radio afterglows is expected to lie between 0.1 to 1 gpc , depending on afterglow parameters [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_max ] ) ] , so it should be possible to detect the host galaxies and obtain their redshifts .",
    "rsne should typically lie at significantly shorter distances ( see  [ sec : rsne ] ) .",
    "detection of such bimodality in redshift distribution will greatly assist in identifying radio grbs .",
    "furthermore , the relativistic expansion of the grb remnants also implies , as explained above , that unlike rsne they may be resolved with the vlba , possibly revealing anisotropic structure .",
    "efficient rejection of flaring blazars would require follow - up observations in the radio , optical and x - ray bands .",
    "in particular , the orphan radio afterglows should exhibit a @xmath192 decay of the radio flux .    finally , it is conceivable that grbs emit substantial amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves and high - energy neutrinos ( @xcite ; see @xcite for review ) .",
    "association of orphan radio afterglows with potential signals in gravitational wave and neutrino detectors may help increasing the signal - to - noise ratio . in a model proposed recently ( @xcite ) , the grb results from extraction of the rotational energy of a kerr black hole through its interaction with a magnetized torus .",
    "this model predicts that the major fraction of the rotational energy available will be emitted in the form of gravitational waves in the band 0.5 - 1.5 khz , for a reasonable range of black hole masses .",
    "it further proposes that measuring the product of the total energy carried by the gravitational waves and the corresponding frequency , which reflects the compactness of the system , can provide an existence test for kerr black holes .",
    "however , such a measurement requires a knowledge of the distance to the source .",
    "since the gravitational wave emission is isotropic , the chance of associating a ligo source with a grb event is small if grbs have a beaming factor as large as currently believed . nevertheless ,",
    "if this model is correct , then ligo sources should be associated with the orphan radio afterglows that should appear several months after the burst of gravitational radiation . at the distance within which ligo can detect the predicted signal ( @xmath246 100 mpc ) ,",
    "the radio source is expected to be very bright ( see eq . [ [ fmax ] ] ) and can be monitored for at least several years . even though the angular resolution of the gravitational wave telescopes is expected to be quite poor",
    ", the chance that such a bright transient would coincide with a ligo source should still be very small , and so such an association would be statistically significant .",
    "our analysis for instance yielded an upper limit of about @xmath247 transients per square degree above 10 mjy .",
    "the association of a radio afterglow with a ligo source would also provide a means to identify the host galaxy , given the superior resolution of the radio telescopes , and hence a distance measurement for the ligo source .",
