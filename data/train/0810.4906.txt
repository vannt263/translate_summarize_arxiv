    "neutral meson mixing is a flavor changing process , resulting in a flavor change @xmath1 and within the standard model it occurs via box diagrams with internal quarks and @xmath2 bosons . while the charged current flavor violating interactions",
    "can appear at the tree level , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions are feasible only at the loop level .",
    "hence these interactions have an important role to play in the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , or new physics(np ) , as the new particles could appear virtually in the loops .",
    "one hopes to constrain np by a measurement of these fcnc processes .",
    "untill march 2007 , neutral meson mixing had only been seen in the down type mesons : @xmath3(in 1956 ) , @xmath4(in 1987 ) and @xmath5(in 2006 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 in @xmath7 mixing played a constraining role in building of models of np .",
    "the measured mixing in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , being consistent with sm predictions has also resulted in constraining various np models .",
    "@xmath0 meson is the only up type meson where mixing is possible .",
    "evidence for mixing in the neutral @xmath0 meson system has recently been reported  @xcite by the belle , babar and cdf collaborations .",
    "these experiments find non - vanishing width and mass differences between the two neutral @xmath0 mass eigenstates assuming negligible cp violation ( cpv ) .",
    "the hfag average for ichep08  @xcite rules out the no mixing scenario at @xmath8 . in the standard model one expects the mixing parameters in the d system to be small .",
    "further , decays of the @xmath0 meson via tree diagrams as well as @xmath9 mixing- due to the negligible contribution of the internal @xmath10 quark in the box diagram , essentially involve only two generations .",
    "hence one expects that there should be no cpv in the charm system .",
    "while the internal charm quark makes the dominant contribution in the box diagram for @xmath7 mixing , the large top mass is responsible for appreciable mixing in @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons inspite of the suppression due to the small ckm elements .",
    "in fact , mixing in the neutral @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems resulted in predictions for the charm and top quark masses respectively , before direct discovery .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 meson system , the heaviest down type quark , the b quark is not heavy enough to compensate for the large suppression due to the small ckm factor , @xmath11 .",
    "contributions from the internal light quarks ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) are dominant and hence , the mixing parameters in the d system are expected to be small . in the flavor su(3 )",
    "limit one would expect mixing to exactly vanish .",
    "in fact , it has been shown to arise only at second order in su(3 ) breaking  @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation of the sm mixing parameters in the @xmath0 system is very hard .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath0 meson mass lies in the intermediate range where neither the inclusive nor the exclusive approaches work too well .",
    "an inclusive approach is based on an operator product expansion in terms of matrix elements of local operators of increasing dimensions with coefficients in powers of @xmath14 . however , @xmath15 is not large enough to allow the expansion upto few terms to be accurate .",
    "such calculations  @xcite suggest mass and width differences of order @xmath16 . on the other hand , in an exclusive approach , summing over hadronic final states also fails as @xmath0 is not light enough , that just a sum over few exclusive channels could suffice .",
    "moreover , cancellations between states within a given su(3 ) multiplet requires that the contribution of each state be known with high precision . in ref .",
    "@xcite su(3 ) , breaking arising from phase space differences was studied and it was concluded that the width difference could be at the level of one percent .    since the theoretical predictions of the @xmath0 mixing parameters by various groups vary over orders of magnitude , a clear signal of np from comparison of the expected and observed values of the mass and width differences may be hard",
    ". however , an observation of cpv will imply presence of np  @xcite , independent of hadronic uncertainties . in most extensions of sm",
    ", the decay amplitudes and width difference are not expected to be affected by np , however , the mass difference could be modified by new short distance cp violating contributions . in our discussion",
    ", we consider cpv only in the mixing and no direct violation  @xcite .",
    "time evolution of the @xmath0 system is governed by the schrodinger equation : @xmath17 m_{12}^*-i\\dsp\\frac{\\gamma_{12 } ^*}{2 } & m_{22}-i\\dsp\\frac{\\gamma_{22}}{2 } \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{r } d^0 \\\\ \\bar{d^0 }   \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 from cpt invariance .",
    "the neutral @xmath0 mass eigenstates are related to the weak eigenstates by , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 with @xmath22 is obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the off diagonal elements of the mass matrix are due to transitions via off - shell intermediate states while those of the decay matrix are from on shell states and therefore constitute respectively the the dispersive and absorptive parts of @xmath0 mixing . if the magnitude of @xmath23 differs from unity and/or the weak phase @xmath24 is nonvanishing , this would signal @xmath25 violation .",
    "the time evolution of the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 which start of as pure @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the average mass and width of the two mass eigenstates , also the the mass and width differences of these eigenstates are popularly written  @xcite in terms of the dimensionless variables , @xmath35 the time evolution functions @xmath36 are studied in the limit @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this limit",

    ", there is a mixing contribution through the sequence @xmath47 .",
    "the interference of this mixing contribution with the direct decay , involves the mixing parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , as well as the magnitude @xmath52 and strong phase @xmath53 of the ratio of the @xmath54 and @xmath43 amplitudes and plays a key role in their measurement .",
    "the branching ratios of the cabibbo favored ( cf ) decays are large and naively one might expect that one should use these decays to determine the parameters . however , if @xmath43 is cf , @xmath54 is doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) and hence the interference term is too tiny compared to leading term in the time dependent decay amplitude . for example , the decay rate for @xmath55 is , @xmath56\\gamma t + ...    \\big],\\ ] ] where , @xmath57 and the ratio of the dcs to cf amplitude is defined as : @xmath58 since @xmath59 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are much less than unity , even the linear term in @xmath60 is negligible compared to the constant term and the cf decay rate can can only be used to determine @xmath61 . in a dcs mode on the other hand the constant , linear and quadratic terms in @xmath60 in the time dependent decay rate",

    "the suppression from the small mixing parameters is compensated by the larger @xmath54 rate . the time dependent decay rate of @xmath62 as well as its conjugate mode was used by babar and cdf collaborations to determine  @xcite @xmath66 ( from the linear term ) and @xmath67 ( from the quadratic term ) , assuming cp conservation .    in the case of singly cabibbo suppressed ( scs ) @xmath25 eigenstates modes , the strong phase is identically zero ; and hence , the time dependent decay rate for these modes , like @xmath68 reduces to the simple form : @xmath69~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unlike the dcs modes where the term quadratic in @xmath60 is enhanced by the ratio of cf to dcs rates , in the scs modes all time dependent terms are of the same order in @xmath70 , hence quadratic and higher terms in @xmath60 can not be extracted .",
    "assuming @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the linear term in @xmath60 can directly measure @xmath49 , as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite(@xmath73 of ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath49 for no cpv ) .",
    "however , the time dependent study of only the scs cp eigenstates does not allow @xmath48 to be determined , even in the limit @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "a dalitz plot analysis  @xcite of @xmath74 has also been performed by the belle collaboration to determine all the mixing parameters . but",
    "this has systematic errors associated with the parameterization of the resonant content of the dalitz plot and hence is model - dependent .",
    "measurements of @xmath73 using @xmath75 as well as that of @xmath66 and @xmath67 using @xmath76 were also reported  @xcite at this conference .    since the sm estimates of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are uncertain , the current experimental results for these parameters can not have any clear implications for np .",
    "however , these results already constrain the parameter space of various models . in supersymmetric models with quark - squark alignment ,",
    "constraints on the up - type squark matrices have been discussed in ref .",
    "they seem to imply squark and gluino masses above 2 tev .",
    "a detailed analysis of various np models has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . out of the 21 models considered , only 4 are ineffective in producing charm mixing at the observed level . for the rest of the 17 models constraints on masses and mixing parameters are obtained .    as pointed out earlier , within the sm ,",
    "cpv in the @xmath0 system is negligible and an observation of cpv would be a clear signal of new physics .",
    "babar and belle have looked for cpv by calculating @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath41 and @xmath77 separately .",
    "they have also searched for cpv by measuring the difference of the decay rates of @xmath77 and @xmath41 to scs cp eigenstates .",
    "no evidence of cpv has been obtained .",
    "it is hence important to have a technique to accurately measure the cp violating phase .",
    "a technique to accurately determine all the mixing parameters including the cp violating phase has been given in ref .",
    "it was shown that using the dcs mode @xmath78 and its conjugate modes , one can solve for all the @xmath79 mixing parameters .",
    "this is possible if the @xmath80 is reconstructed both in the self tagging @xmath81 mode and in the cp eigenstate @xmath82 mode .    with the @xmath80 reconstructed in the self tagging @xmath81 modes ,",
    "the time dependent decay rate has a form similar to that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcs ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath83 can easily be measured using the time integrated rate for the cf mode @xmath84 .",
    "the magnitude of the ratio of the dcs to cf amplitude can hence be determined using constant term in time dependent decay rate .",
    "the quadratic terms in @xmath60 in the time dependent decay rates of @xmath85 and its conjugate mode @xmath86 readily determine @xmath50 and @xmath87 .",
    "the interference terms , now involve the 4 unknown parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 , with a known value of @xmath87 .",
    "to determine them all , an additional observable is required .",
    "the @xmath80 in the final state could also have been reconstructed in the neutral @xmath82 mode , this provides the required additional observable .",
    "a unique feature of the final state @xmath88 is that it includes contributions from both @xmath89 as well as @xmath90 states ; the amplitude for this final state is thus a sum of the cf and dcs amplitudes , @xmath91 since the decay mode involves two neutral pions it will not be easy to perform a time dependent study .",
    "hence , we consider only the time integrated decay rate for this mode .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 are equal since @xmath94 is a cp eigenstate .",
    "hence , the time integrated decay rate for @xmath95 has the form , @xmath96.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this along with the linear terms of the time dependent decay rates of the self tagging modes allows a solution for @xmath97 and for @xmath98 with a four - fold ambiguity . @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "can thus be individually determined since @xmath87 is known . the solution obtained is finite even if @xmath72 , with a correction term of order @xmath99 .",
    "hence an accurate estimation is possible , even if @xmath51 is tiny .",
    "it should be possible to determine @xmath100 , @xmath101 to order @xmath102 , @xmath103 respectively and @xmath51 to about @xmath104 at a super - b factory with an integrated luminosity of @xmath105  .",
    "while the scs cp eigenstates like @xmath106 can not alone be used to determine all the mixing parameters , minimal additional information from dcs modes makes this possible .",
    "this approach may provide the optimal method to determine all the parameters with current data .",
    "for the scs - cp eigenstates , the strong phase is identically zero and the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "the coefficients of the linear term in @xmath60 , in the time dependent decay rate is a function of 3 parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 . as pointed out earlier the quadratic and higher terms in @xmath60 can not be extracted . however ,",
    "if we also include in this analysis the quadratic terms in @xmath60 from the time dependent decay rates of dcs modes such as @xmath108 , all the mixing parameters can be solved without approximation . since @xmath109 , these quadratic",
    "terms readily determine @xmath50 and @xmath110 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath50 and @xmath111 could be measured using time integrated wrong sign relative to right sign sl decay rates . having obtained @xmath50 and @xmath111 , @xmath51 and @xmath98 can easily be determined from @xmath106 and the solutions have been shown to be finite even for small @xmath51 .    it may be further pointed out that if information from @xmath112 modes is added to that from the @xmath113 modes it helps in reducing the ambiguities in @xmath48 and @xmath49 from four - fold to two - fold .",
    "it has recently been proposed to use the singly cabibbo suppressed ( scs ) @xmath114 modes to determine the mixing parameters  @xcite . however ,",
    "if @xmath51 is zero , these methods would be feasible only if the strong phase involved is measured elsewhere .",
    "mixing in the neutral @xmath0 system has been clearly established .",
    "the standard model predictions involve large uncertainties , obscuring detection of new physics contributions .",
    "an observation of cp violation in @xmath0 mixing would clearly imply new physics .",
    "the @xmath115 modes are an example where it is possible to measure the cp violating parameters as well as the mass and width differences of the two @xmath0 meson mass - eigenstates using only related final states , thereby reducing systematic errors",
