    "@xcite considered a joint effect of the zeeman coupling , magnetic flux and soi on the conductance of a 1d ring beyond the adiabatic approximation employed in ref .  .",
    "nitta _ et .",
    "_ @xcite noted that soi alone , without the magnetic field , can cause oscillations of the ring electric conductance . et al.@xcite pointed out that the hamiltonian used earlier in ref .",
    "was not quite correct and , in particular , was not hermitian . using the correct hamiltonian frustaglia and",
    "richter@xcite revised the expression for the conductance found in ref .  .",
    "in disordered mesoscopic systems the ac effect is strongly modified . multiple impurity scatterings lead to averaging out of some strong oscillations that were presented in ideal 1d rings .",
    "there is a similarity to ab effect where the fundamental @xmath0 peak in the fourier spectrum of magnetoconductance vanishes and is substituted for @xmath1 altshuler , aronov , and spivak @xcite oscillations .",
    "mathur and stone @xcite have demonstrated that a similar weak localization effect takes place in the case of ac oscillations in a thin diffusive ring with rashba soi .",
    "they have shown that the average conductance periodically varies as a function of the soi coupling constant with a period that is 1/2 of the ideal ring conductance oscillations .",
    "this prediction have been confirmed experimentally by koga et al.@xcite who observed that the amplitude of @xmath1 magnetoconductance oscillations ( aas type oscillations ) oscillates itself with varying the applied gate voltage and , correspondingly , the soi strength . on the other hand , the fundamental ab , as well as",
    "ac oscillations show up in mesoscopic conductance fluctuations .",
    "the conductance correlator has been calculated in ref .",
    "for a diffusive ring in the presence of zeeman coupling and rashba soi .",
    "it was found that the amplitude of @xmath0 ab peak shows oscillations with varying soi , similar to those that have been observed for the @xmath1 peak in ref .  .",
    "although 1d , as well as diffusive models are useful to elucidate fundamental physical effects associated with soi , they can not be fully applied to realistic semiconductor systems used in experiments .",
    "for example , an attempt to interpret the observed @xcite splitting of the ab power spectrum within the diffusion model @xcite was not successful . in ref .",
    ", as well as in other experimental works @xcite , the mesoscopic loops carry many channels . at the same time their sizes are comparable to the electron mean free path . therefore , neither of the above theoretical models can be applied . in this situation",
    "an approach based on path integrals along classic trajectories can be fruitful .",
    "such a method has been applied to transport in mesoscopic systems in a number of works @xcite .",
    "it was also employed for calculation of the spin conductance through a classically chaotic and regular cavities and rings with rashba soi @xcite . in ref .",
    "it was done analytically by applying the method of trajectory averaging , while numerical simulations of path integrals were performed in ref .. in both cases pronounced ac oscillations of the spin conductance with varying soi constant had been found .",
    "their important distinction from oscillations of the electric conductance is that they appear in the main semiclassical approximation , not involving weak localization or other quantum corrections .    while in a multichannel loop studied in ref .",
    "the electron motion was two - dimensional , the ac phase accumulation had an effectively one - dimensional character .",
    "the reason is that in a thin enough loop soi causes only a small variation of spinor amplitudes during particle motion along any straight segment of a trajectory . in the leading approximation ignoring ac phase fluctuations associated with a finiteness of a loop width , a phase evolution depends only on a coordinate along the loop and finite width effects vanish . on the other hand ,",
    "as follows from the monte carlo analysis @xcite , when a particle lifetime within the ring is long enough , the finite width effect on the amplitude and shape of ac oscillations is strong .    in order to elucidate this problem",
    "we will calculate the spin conductance taking into account the finite width effect in a classically chaotic multi - channel ring with the rashba spin - orbit interaction and a uniform magnetic field applied perpendicular to the ring .",
    "a chaotic motion of particles can be provided by non ideal boundaries of the ring , as well as by random potential variations inside it .",
    "starting from an analog of the landauer formula derived for the spin conductance in appendix  [ landauer ] , we apply the path integral method to this conductance . within this approximation spin",
    "dependent transmission amplitudes for each of the classical paths decompose into a product of a spin independent transmission amplitude and a matrix determining evolution of spinor components along this trajectory .",
    "the expression for the spin conductance that is quadratic in these amplitudes should be double summed over the trajectories afterwards . ignoring weak localization and other quantum corrections , only the terms diagonal with respect to the trajectories",
    "are then retained . as a result",
    ", the spin conductance takes a form of a @xmath2 matrix averaged over the trajectories .",
    "based on known statistical properties of chaotic trajectories we will derive fokker - planck equations describing spin evolution of a particle moving through the ring and analytically calculate the average of spin conductance matrix components .",
    "the finite width effects will be analyzed that show up in an additional broadening and decreasing of ac oscillations .",
    "the magnetic field , in its turn , results in appearance of spin conductance components that were equal to zero in the absence of the field , suggesting thus an opportunity to rotate the spin polarization on the exit from the ring .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "we assume the hard wall reflection of electrons from the ring boundaries . since the particle spin is conserved upon such a reflection , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_h_z ] ) and ( [ eq_h_r ] ) determine a spin dynamics in the ring .",
    "the reservoirs are assumed to be in a local thermodynamic equilibrium with a given polarization ( magnetization ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the left reservoir is polarized ( along a unit vector @xmath21 ) , while the right one is unpolarized .",
    "the polarization of the left reservoir is characterized by the chemical potentials @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for spin - up and spin - down ( relative to @xmath21 ) electrons , respectively . for the right reservoir",
    "we assume , in its turn , that @xmath24 .",
    "this situation is of particular interest for our further analysis , because establishing of thermodynamic equilibrium between spin subsystems in the reservoirs will be accompanied by the spin current , while the electric current will be absent . in the linear response regime",

    "we assume that the leads connecting the ring with reservoirs are ideal conductors with a constant cross section .",
    "this suggests the use of the landauer approach for calculation of the spin current .",
    "the latter , however , has an important distinction from the electric current , because it does not conserve in the region with so interaction .",
    "let us assume , for example , that such a region is ideally transparent . even in this case the transmitted spin current will not be equal to the incident one .",
    "alternatively , we may consider a polarized reservoir connected via _",
    "one _ lead to a region with so interaction . in the stationary case",
    "the electric current through this lead will be zero . at the same time",
    ", the spin current will be finite , because spin polarizations of incident and reflected electrons can be different .",
    "this sort of spin transport has been considered in ref .   where a ring played the role of the region with so interaction .",
    "so , we see that landauer formula should be modified to take into account effects of nonconcerving spin . in general case it is done in appendix  [ landauer ] . for a particular set up considered in this work the expression for the spin conductance takes a simple form , somewhat similar to the landauer formula @xmath30    here @xmath31 is the @xmath32 matrix composed of the transmission amplitudes @xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 from the channel @xmath37 of the left lead to the channel @xmath38 of the right lead .",

    "in fact , this assumption means that in the leading semiclassical approximation we ignore a difference between fermi velocities corresponding to spin - split subbands .",

    "have been predicted in ref .  .",
    "this distinction can be explained by importance of quantum effects in an ideal 1d ring considered in ref .  , while such effects are small in a disordered multichannel system that we study here .",
    "they can be taken into account as weak localization corrections to ac oscillations similar to those studied for diffusive rings .",

    "here @xmath89 is the transmission amplitude from the channel @xmath37 on the left to the channel @xmath38 on the right .",
    "so , the transparency @xmath90 is normalized to the number of open channels @xmath91 . applying configurational averaging to the above expression",

    "we assume that the classical motion of an electron inside the ring is _ chaotic_.",
    "the chaotic dynamics is provided by small scale bumps and other irregularities on the ring boundaries , while macroscopically the ring preserves its regular shape .",
    "for chaotic trajectories after long enough time an electron `` forgets '' through which of the leads it entered the ring .",

    "an immediate conclusion follows : if the resonance condition is satisfied , that is the effective polarizations corresponding to different trajectories on the exit from the ring are co - directional , then the spin current will have a maximum .",
