    "shortly after the relativistic equation of electron was established by dirac , klein used it to study electron scattering by a potential step and found that there exists a nonzero transmission probability even though the potential height tends to infinity@xcite , in contrast to the scattering of a non - relativistic particle .",
    "this phenomenon has been referred to as klein tunneling ( kt ) .",
    "kt is an intrinsic relativistic effect and is interpreted as a fundamental property of dirac equation that particle and antiparticle states are inherently linked together as two components of the same spinor wavefunction @xcite .",
    "this unique scattering process has attracted lots of interest over the past eighty years but failed to be directly tested by elementary particles due to the requirements of currently unavailable electric field gradients @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics of particles in some systems , such as electrons in graphene @xcite and trap ions @xcite etc . , may be described by effective relativistic wave equations and have been proposed to observe such relativistic tunneling .",
    "ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and light - induced gauge fields @xcite are also able to behave as relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in graphene heterojunctions @xcite have provided some indications for kt",
    ". however , the existence of disorders and interactions in these solid - state systems makes it hard to realize full ballistic scatterings .",
    "in addition , it seems hard to unambiguously observe kt in graphene since it is a typical two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , while scattering in a 2d system is a combination of perfect transmission for normally incident particles ( a relativistic effect ) and exponentially decay tunneling for obliquely incident particles ( a non - relativistic effect ) .",
    "kt as well as zitterbewegung effect have been experimentally simulated with the trapped ions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe macroscopic kt with spin - orbit coupled becs @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that a one - dimensional nonlinear dirac equation ( nlde ) with tunable parameters can be realized with a spinor bec in the presence of a light - induced gauge field . through numerical simulations , we demonstrate that a macroscopic kt can be observed under realistic conditions . the simple configuration of gauge field , in combination with controllable dimensions , interactions and potential barriers may provide us with a clean and tunable platform for investigation of interesting relativistic tunneling effects .",
    "we investigate the relativistic tunneling of a macroscopic quantum object by comparing the transmission coefficients between a bec in the absence of interactions and an incoherent ensemble average of non - condensed atoms .",
    "in addition , we find that a realistically weak interaction between atoms slightly affects the transmission coefficients .",
    "the main feature of a bec is that all atoms in the bec are in the same state and in the same phase and thus the bec can be considered a macroscopic object .",
    "so the tunneling of a bec we study is the coherent scattering of a macroscopic object .",
    "tunneling in the former shows a distinct difference in relativistic effects between macroscopic objects and the ensemble average of some microscopic particles , while kt has been studied previously only within a single - particle scenario .",
    "we also present another unexpected result : that a bec with a negative energy can almost completely transmit through a gaussian barrier . since kt is a relativistic phenomenon associated with an anti - particle in the potential , our proposed spin - orbit coupled bec can mimic a macroscopic anti - bec ( a super - atom made from anti - atoms ) , at least in a scattering problem .",
    "therefore , the mimicked anti - bec may open the possibility of exploring exotic relativistic effects of a macroscopic body ( even for very large antimatter ) , in contrast to the conventional wisdom that relativistic effects are only clearer for a microscopic particle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we propose an approach to realize a spin - orbit coupled atomic gas through a @xmath0-level configuration , and then demonstrate that the dynamics of the atoms should be described by the nlde when the atoms are condensed into a bec . in sec .",
    "iii we show that the region for kt of a single atom can be reached in experiments .",
    "then we demonstrate in sec .",
    "iv that kt of becs can be clearly observed .",
    "we also clarify the macroscopic quantum coherence in such relativistic tunneling and show that a wide gaussian potential barrier is transparent for a bec with a negative energy . in sec .",
    "v , we present our discussion and conclusion . in the appendix , we briefly review the numerical method to calculate the transmission coefficient of a single atom scattered by a gaussian potential .",

    "the dirac equation with tunable parameters can be realized with ultracold atoms through two approaches @xcite . similarly to graphene , it was proposed that low - energy quasiparticles in a honeycomb optical lattice should also be described by the relativistic dirac equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hamiltonian of cold atoms ( without optical lattices ) with a certain spin - orbit coupling , which can be achieved with synthetic gauge fields , is a dirac hamiltonian when the wave number of the atoms is much smaller than the wave number of the laser beams .",
    "it is demonstrated that the required spin - orbit coupling can be realized though a tripod level configuration @xcite . in this paper",
    "we proposed that a @xmath0-level configuration is also feasible for use in the realization of the dirac equation .",

    "we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28+\\frac{\\hbar\\omega^2}{2\\delta}$ ] . in the derivation",
    ", we have dropped an irrelevant constant and assumed that the potentials @xmath29 are spin - independent .",
    "furthermore , the atomic gas can well be confined by a 1d optical waveguide along the @xmath4 axis @xcite , so we may further restrict our study in the 1d system .",
    "therefore , both tripod- and @xmath0-level configurations can be used , in principle , in the realization of the dirac equation .",
    "compared with the tripod configuration @xcite , a large detuning is necessary in the @xmath30 configuration .",
    "however , the laser beams are simpler in the @xmath0-level configuration . furthermore , the pseudospins in the @xmath30 configuration would be more robust against the collision of atoms since they are constructed by the lowest two dressed states , while the two dark states in the tripod configuration are not the ground states .",
    "we assume that the interaction can be described by an effective 1d interacting strength @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the scattering length , @xmath33 is the particle number , and @xmath34 is the oscillator length associated with a harmonic vertical confinement .",
    "the interaction between the atoms ( per particle ) should be much smaller than the confinement frequency ( about khz)@xcite , and thus is also much smaller than @xmath35 ( in the mhz range ) , therefore the interaction can not pump the atoms outside of the near - degenerate subspace . under the condition @xmath36 , we can safely neglect the @xmath37 term .",
    "in addition , we assume that the bosonic atoms are condensed into a bec state . within the gross - pitaevskii formalism , the interacting bosons in the near - degenerate subspace are then effectively described by a 1d nlde as @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the effective speed of light and @xmath41 as the effective rest energy of the cold atoms .",
    "it is a remarkable feature that all parameters , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , can be controlled experimentally , providing us with a tunable platform for exploration of the relativistic quantum effects .",
    "we now address the relativistic quantum tunneling that can be observed with cold atoms . to get an intuitive physics picture , we first consider a single atom with energy @xmath43 scattered by a square potential with width @xmath44 and potential height @xmath45 .",
    "such a potential can be experimentally formed by a laser beam with a flat - top profile @xcite .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath46 for the so - called kt regime @xmath47 @xcite , can be obtained explicitly as @xmath48^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "compared with the well - known property in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics that the transmission coefficient decreases mono - exponentially with the height @xmath45 or width @xmath44 , a distinctly different feature within this kt region is that the tunneling amplitude is an oscillation function of @xmath45 or @xmath44 even when the kinetic energy of the incident particle is less than the height of the barrier .",
    "this relativistic effect can be attributed to the fact that the incident particle in a positive energy state can propagate inside the barrier by occupying a negative energy state , which is also a plane wave aligned in energy with that of the particle continuum outside . matching between positive and negative energy states across the barrier leads to high - probability tunneling .",
    "we take the atoms of @xmath51li as an example .",
    "if we choose the practical parameters @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath53 , @xmath55 hz and @xmath56 hz , it is found that the klein regime corresponds to the rabi frequency @xmath57 mhz , which can be easily achieved in experiments .",
    "so we have demonstrated from a simple example that it is feasible to observe kt with cold atoms .",
    "as for a practical experiment it is required to release two conditions : the trajectory of a single atom is hard to detect , and it is much easier to measure the density evolution of an ensemble of atoms in experiments . compared with the square potential , a gaussian potential @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the height and @xmath60 characterizes the spatial variance , is much easier to be generated . here",
    "@xmath61 donates a barrier @xmath62 or a potential well @xmath63 , and the potential barrier ( well ) can be realized by focusing a blue- ( red- ) detuned far - off - resonant gaussian - shaped laser beam .",
    "however , the conditions of resonant transmission vary with the velocity and the width of the potential , and thus both the ensemble of atoms and the gaussian potential may smooth the oscillations in the transmission coefficient . so it is natural to ask whether kt can still be observed in an ensemble of atoms .",
    "surprisingly we illustrate below that kt of a bec may be observed very clearly .",
    "[ becscatter ] .",
    "the peaks at @xmath64 are the gaussian barriers.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=113 ]    we assume that a bec consisting of @xmath65li is initially trapped in a harmonic trap which moves along the @xmath4 axis . at the initial time @xmath66 , the center of the trap is located at @xmath67 , and the center of the gaussian potential is at @xmath64 .",
    "the trap is turned off at @xmath66 and then we calculate the evolution of the density profile of the atomic gas after a long enough time for scattering . the single - atom dispersion described in eq .",
    "( [ nlde ] ) is characterized by two branches @xmath68 , where the lower ( upper ) branch represents the negative ( positive ) energy state .",
    "one can prepare an initial bec with a designated mode @xmath69 at the positive or negative energy branch .",
    "the two branches allow us to study a more fruitful tunneling problem : there are four classes of scattering which describe the wave function @xmath70 [ @xmath71 scattered by the potential @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) .",
    "we have numerically calculated @xmath84 , and found the existence of stationary solution for the scattering process , with an example being shown in fig .",
    "after tunneling , the incident wave packet divides into left- and right - traveling wave packets , and only the latter one is on the transmission side of the barrier .",
    "thus we can define the transmission coefficient of the incident wave packet @xmath89 scattering by a potential @xmath72 as @xmath90 here @xmath91 ( being slightly larger than @xmath92 ) represents a typical time that the reflected and transmitted wave packets are sufficiently away from the gaussian potential .",
    "one can directly measure the transmission coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ tmn ] ) since the spatial density distribution @xmath93 can be detected using absorption imaging @xcite .",
    "we first look into the tunneling phenomena for a bec in the absence of interactions ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we note that there are two identities @xmath95 and @xmath96 since eq.([nlde ] ) with @xmath94 is invariant under the charge conjugation @xcite .",
    "we plot the transmission coefficient @xmath97 as a function of the height @xmath59 and width @xmath60 in fig .",
    "3(a ) with the practical parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transmission coefficient decreases exponentially to zero with @xmath59 when @xmath98 , while it increases and then is an oscillating function in the klein region @xmath99 , these results are similar to the results of eq .",
    "( [ t_d ] ) for the square barrier . here",
    "the critical value of the potential height may be estimated approximately using the square barrier with @xmath100 mhz . moreover , the feature @xmath95 is also confirmed in the inset in fig .",
    "3(a ) . as for the transmission coefficient @xmath101",
    ", we may obtain several tunneling oscillations with the potential width , but it decreases to 0 when the width is further increased .",
    "although the amplitude of tunneling oscillation is less than the unit compared with the tunneling of a single atom , the amplitude of tunneling oscillation can be more than @xmath102 and meanwhile the period can be a few micrometers , which is experimentally detectable .",
    "another interesting feature induced by relativistic effects is that , a bec with negative energy can almost completely transmit a wide gaussian potential barrier , as shown in fig .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath103 is an oscillating function of the potential width @xmath60 when @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath104 m , while it saturates quickly to the unit when the potential width is larger than @xmath105 m , leading to the unexpected result that a wide gaussian potential barrier is actually totally transparent for a bec .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood through the fact that this scattering feature is actually equivalent to that of a bec of positive energy scattered by a gaussian potential well because of @xmath96 .",
    "we also calculate the transmission coefficient for the central mode of the wave packet , as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "3(b ) , which further confirms that a wide enough gaussian potential well is transparent .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that , in contrast to the periodic function ( without a saturation value ) in a square potential well , the gaussian potential well is smooth in the whole space , and thus can even support adiabatic motions of wave packets in the large width limit .",

    "3(a ) and 3(b ) are intrinsic relativistic and macroscopic quantum phenomena that can not be explained with an incoherent ensemble average of many atoms .",

    "the coefficient @xmath137 represents an incoherent transmission of the individual particles since it is a sum of the transmission coefficients of all particles .",
    "in contrast , the phases of all atoms in the bec are the same and then the transmission of a bec is coherent .",
    "the coherent transmission in a bec and incoherence in @xmath137 cause the difference in fig .",
    "all particles in the bec are in the same phase because the macroscopic number of particles are condensed in the same state , so the coherent transmission of the bec may be called macroscopic quantum tunneling .    to clarify further the macroscopic quantum phenomena in the relativistic tunneling of a bec , we compare the scaling properties of transmission coefficients for a weakly interacting bec and an incoherent ensemble average of atoms .",
    "an example of scaling of @xmath97 is plotted in fig .",
    "4(a ) . in the calculations ,",
    "we have fixed the weak interatomic interaction energy @xmath140 and kept the parameter @xmath141",
    "@xcite for @xmath142 @xmath109 m when @xmath121 , @xmath111 @xmath109 m and @xmath112 ( @xmath143 ) , both of which restrict our discussions in the regime for 1d becs , where dirac dynamics instead of nonlinear dynamics dominates . in this case , the increase in particle number is achieved by proportionally increasing the length @xmath74 of the bec with small @xmath144 .",
    "for comparison , we also calculate the scaling of @xmath145 for the atom numbers of 1 ( with @xmath146 ) , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath116 in fig .",
    "4(b ) . comparing fig .",
    "4(a ) with fig .",
    "a distinct difference between the bec and the ensemble average of the individual atoms is that , the coefficient @xmath97 increases with increasing atomic number of the bec , while the coefficient @xmath145 decreases with the increasing of the atomic number .",
    "however , in order to keep the same interaction parameter in the above calculation , we have increased simultaneously the particle number and the width of the gaussian wave packet . in this way the momentum distribution of the wave functions is shrunk , which is a dominant reason for the above scaling feature . that many atoms may condense into the same momentum state",
    "is essential for the observation of kt in a bec .",
    "before concluding , we wish to make two additional comments .",
    "( i ) to judge the feasibility of the dirac approximation in eq.([nlde ] ) , the coefficients @xmath97 with or without the quadratic term are compared in fig .",
    "it is shown that the quadratic term leads to merely a slight left - shift of the tunneling peaks .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted by the fact that the wavelength of the bec inside the barrier decreases slightly in the presence of the additional low kinetic energy .",
    "this result verifies that the approximation leading to the dirac equation is well satisfied .",
    "( ii ) in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we have also calculated the transmission coefficient for becs with conventional atomic interactions without feshbach resonance , in which case the experimental setup can be simplified .",
    "the result shows that the effect of the realistically weak interaction is small ; it merely smooths the tunneling oscillation slightly .",
    "therefore the exotic tunneling phenomena addressed here survive in the case of weak interaction between atoms .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed an experimental scheme to detect macroscopic kt using a spin - orbit - coupled bec . through numerical simulations",
    ", we have elaborated that such macroscopic kt can be observed under realistic conditions . in view of the fact that a spin - orbit - coupled bec was realized in a very recent experiment @xcite",
    ", it is anticipated that the present proposal will be tested in an experiment in the near - future .",
    "this work was supported by the nsfc ( nos . 11125417 and 10974059 ) , the skpbr ( no.2011cb922104 ) , the grf and crf of the rgc of hong kong .",
    "the dirac equation for particle scattering by a gaussian potential can not be solved analytically for an incoming atom with energy @xmath147 and momentum @xmath148 .",
    "however , here we adopt an efficient method to solve it numerically based on transfer matrix methods @xcite .",
    "the numerical procedures are outlined as follows .",
    "first , one cuts the gaussian potential into a spatially finite range @xmath149 $ ] , where the cutoff position @xmath150 should be chosen to guarantee that the potential height outside the range is low enough to be transparent for the atoms , i.e. , @xmath151 .",
    "second , one divides this range equally into @xmath152 spindly segments , and each segment may be considered a square potential if @xmath152 is large enough .",
