    "dynamo action is the mechanism by which a magnetic field is generated and sustained through the motion of an electrically conducting fluid .",
    "one of the goals of dynamo theory is to understand the processes of the magnetic field in certain planets and stars .",
    "there is a considerable body of work on this topic in the astrophysical , geophysical and mathematical literature including the classical book of moffatt @xcite . in this context",
    "the full coupled system of equations of magnetohydrodynamics is extremely challenging and at present inaccessible , even numerically , in parameter ranges relevant to the geodynamo or the solar dynamo .",
    "one approach to simplify the system is to study the so called kinematic dynamo problem . in this approach the lorentz force",
    "is neglected in the evolution equations governing the velocity of a convective , rotating , self gravitationally fluid .",
    "the magnetic induction equation then becomes a linear equation with the velocity being externally prescribed from the dynamically driven fluid flow . in reality , such a flow in a planetary interior is expected to be highly nontrivial with convective plumes and cells associated with chaotic particle paths . over the past decades various models for kinematic dynamos have been proposed and studied : for example , childress and soward @xcite , soward and childress @xcite , jones and roberts @xcite .",
    "the importance of exponential stretching of the fluid trajectories for dynamo action was observed by arnold @xcite , bayly @xcite , vishik @xcite and friedlander and vishik @xcite .",
    "we note that flows with exponential stretching possess strong stochastic properties .",
    "more recent numerical treatments of the kinematic dynamo equations include those of ponty et al @xcite , favier and proctor @xcite .",
    "even though the preponderance of results in this area have been restricted to the case of steady fluid flows there are some interesting articles where the velocities are taken to be non - stationary , for example molchanov et al @xcite and finn and ott @xcite who related the dynamo growth rate with quantitative measures of chaos in the flow .",
    "we note that although the kinematic dynamo equations are more tractable when the prescribed velocity is taken to be steady , a more realistic picture of a planetary interior would be a highly complex , unsteady flow . with this in mind , in our present paper",
    "we examine certain regularity properties of the kinematic dynamo equation under fairly minimal conditions on a prescribed unsteady velocity field .",
    "we do not address the question of dynamo instabilities .",
    "rather we prove that any initial regularity of the magnetic field is guaranteed to persist even when it is deformed by non stationary flows of rather `` wild '' behavior .",
    "we are interested the following system of parabolic equations on @xmath0 :    @xmath1    subjected to the initial condition @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath4 is the time variable and @xmath5 is a positive constant .",
    "@xmath6 is an unknown vector - valued function in @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a prescribed divergence - free vector field . in the context of kinematic dynamo theory , system represents faraday s law of induction equation",
    "in which @xmath9 is a prescribed velocity vector field and @xmath10 is the magnetic field .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study the regularity of solutions to - when @xmath9 is given .",
    "more precisely , we observe the persistence of hlder continuity for weak solutions to - under minimal regularity assumptions on @xmath9 .",
    "we recall some results in the literature related to our work .",
    "the regularity of _ scalar _ solutions @xmath11 to the drift diffusion equation @xmath12 is a classical problem in parabolic pde s : see , for example lady@xmath13henskaya et al @xcite",
    ". however proving hlder regularity of weak solutions of with divergence free drift as rough as @xmath14 was proved only recently in friedlander and vicol @xcite and , at the same time , by seregin et al @xcite .",
    "the issue of regularity for genuinely vector systems such as is even more delicate and rather little is known in norms that are critical with respect to the inherent scaling of the equation .",
    "to our knowledge the best result to date is that of silvestre and vicol @xcite who consider the somewhat artificial vector system based on with coupling of the components via a pressure gradient , namely @xmath15 their result is a propagation of regularity instead of a regularization result .",
    "they prove that if a certain scale invariant norm of the divergence free drift velocity @xmath9 is bounded , then for @xmath16 the @xmath17 norm of @xmath18 at time @xmath19 is bounded in terms of its norm at time zero .",
    "the proof uses campanato s characterization of the hlder modulus of continuity and a maximum principle type argument .",
    "our present analysis of the kinematic dynamo equation closely follows the approach in silvestre and vicol @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our analysis is that we are required to control the `` stretching '' term @xmath20 which involves a derivative of @xmath9 as opposed to the pressure gradient in .",
    "we illustrate the comment in @xcite that their method could be applied to other evolution systems ; in our case to a model for the solar dynamo .",
    "the following is the main result of our work :    let @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 , and define a pair @xmath23 by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "equation becomes the three dimensional navier - stokes equations in vorticity form . in this context theorem  1.1 gives a no blow - up criterion for the navier - stokes equations .",
