    "the accelerating expansion of the universe revealed by supernovae type ia ( snia ) is one of the most significant discoveries in modern cosmology @xcite . in the framework of general relativity ,",

    "using observations is a common starting point for phenomenological studies of dark energy .",
    "interestingly , recent studies show that different kinds of observational data are in tension within the framework of the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "in particular , zhao  ( 2017 ) @xcite quantifies the tension using the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite , and uses a nonparametric dde model to successfully relieve the tension .",
    "their analysis basically shows that the tension within @xmath0cdm can be interpreted as a signal of dynamics of dark energy at a @xmath7 confidence level ( cl ) .    in this paper",

    "but for parametrisation ii .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the reconstruction result with and without the @xmath14 parameter fixed respectively . ]      in this work , we consider two kinds of parametrisations of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the scale factor of the universe , see @xcite . ] .",
    "parametrisation i : :    polynomial expansion @xcite [ eq : poly ] w(a ) = _",
    "i=0^n_p w_i(1-a)^i    where @xmath62 defines the order of the polynomial    expansion .",
    "note that @xmath63 and    @xmath64 are the @xmath2cdm model , in which    @xmath2 is a constant , and the chevallier - polarski - linder    ( cpl ) model @xcite respectively , and including higher order    terms allows more general behaviour of @xmath60 . in this    work ,",
    "we consider cases with @xmath65 .",
    "parametrisation ii : :    oscillatory function    +    although parametrisation i allows for oscillatory behaviours of    @xmath60 in general , it requires a large number of terms in    order to properly approximate a periodic oscillatory function , , a    cosine function .",
    "therefore we consider another kind of parametrisation    as , [ eq : osc ] w(a ) = w_0 + w_1(1-a)^w_2 cos ( w_3 a + w_4 ) this is a    general cosine function that allows its mean , amplitude , period and    phase to be free parameters .",
    "it is similar to the functional form used    in @xcite but is more general in that the @xmath66    term allows the amplitude to vary with the scale factor .",
    "our parametrisation of the universe is thus , [ eq : para ] * p*\\ { _ b , _ c , _ s , , n_s , a_s , w_0 , ... , w_4 , ) where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the baryon and cold dark matter physical densities",
    ", @xmath69 is the angular size of the sound horizon at decoupling , @xmath70 is the optical depth , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the spectral index and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum , and @xmath73 denote the above - mentioned dark energy eos parameters .",
    "we marginalize over nuisance parameters @xmath74 such as the intrinsic sn luminosity , galaxy bias , etc .",
    "the datasets we consider in this work include the gbao measurements that utilize the boss dr12 sample at nine effective redshifts @xcite , the ly@xmath59fb measurements @xcite , the 6dfrs @xcite and sdss main galaxy sample @xcite bao measurements , the wigglez galaxy power spectra @xcite , the recent estimate of the hubble constant @xmath57 obtained from local measurements of cepheids @xcite ( @xmath57 ) , the recent ohd measurements of @xmath56 @xcite , the jla sample of snia @xcite , the weak lensing shear angular power spectra from cfhtlens @xcite and the _ planck _ 2015 cmb temperature and polarisation angular power spectra @xcite .    for the purpose of forecast , we simulate future gbao data assuming a desi sensitivity following @xcite , and also consider a future space - based supernova mission described in @xcite .",
    "we use a modified version of camb @xcite to calculate observables , and include dark energy perturbations following the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "we perform a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) global fitting of parameters listed in eq ( [ eq : para ] ) to a combination of datasets described in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] using a modified version of cosmomc @xcite , and use the polychord @xcite plug - in of cosmomc to compute the bayesian evidence for the model selection .",
    "we present our results in table [ tab : table ] and in figs [ fig : om]-[fig : osc ] .    the quantity @xmath1 is estimated using @xmath56 measurements from _ planck _ 2015 , gbao , ohd and ly@xmath59fb respectively , with the recent @xmath57 measurement presented in @xcite .",
    "to check the constancy of @xmath1 using each individual kind of datasets , and the consistency between different kinds of data , we fit constants to the @xmath1 measurements from _ planck _ 2015 , gbao and ohd separately , and show the 68% cl constraints in cyan , blue and grey horizontal bands respectively in fig [ fig : om ] . specifically ,",
    "we obtain , om(_planck _",

    "furthermore , the @xmath8 values derived here are all smaller than @xmath76 derived from _ planck _",
    "2015 alone in the @xmath0cdm model @xcite , which is @xmath77 .",
    "this to some extent is due to the fact that the @xmath57 value used here , which is @xmath78 km  @xmath79 , is significantly larger than that derived from _ planck _",
    "2015 , which is @xmath80 km  @xmath79 .",
    "all these discrepancy among datasets suggests that the @xmath0cdm model may need to be extended .    for more general de models parametrised by eqs ( [ eq : poly ] ) and ( [ eq : osc ] )",
    ", we derive constraints on model parameters , which are shown in table [ tab : table ] . for the polynomial expansion case ,",
    "we increasingly add higher order terms to the @xmath2cdm model in the global fitting .",
    "we find that the @xmath81 can be reduced by @xmath82 at most for the @xmath83 model .",
    "for the purpose of model selection , we also evaluate the logarithmic bayesian factor , e e_dde- lne_where ed^np()denotes the bayesian evidence , which is an integral of the probability distribution function of @xmath84-dimensional parameters @xmath85 .",
    "we find that @xmath16 is negative for all cases , meaning that neither of these dde models is favoured over the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "for the @xmath83 case , in which @xmath6 is parametrised with five free parameters , is found to be not equal to @xmath86 at @xmath87 cl , and the bayesian factor is as low as @xmath88 , which strongly indicates current data do not support extending @xmath0 in this parametrisation .    for parametrisation",
    "ii , we show results with and without the phase @xmath14 fixed , and find that whether @xmath14 varies or not does not change the result : @xmath81 is reduced by @xmath89 ( a @xmath90 signal of @xmath9 ) by four additional parameters with a bayesian factor @xmath91 .",
    "admittedly , although this model is also not supported by the bayesian evidence , it is much less disfavoured than the @xmath83 model in parametrisation i , and it fits to the data better .    in figs [ fig : poly ] and [ fig : osc ] , we reconstruct @xmath6 using constraints on de parameters we obtained .",
    "as shown , the best fit @xmath6 models with all five de parameters varied , which are shown in the far right panel of fig [ fig : poly ] , and in the lower panel in fig [ fig : osc ] , crosses @xmath86 during evolution , and exhibits certain level of oscillations with respect to redshift @xmath5 , which is consistent with the prediction of the model of _ oscillating quintom _ @xcite .",
    "we compare this result to the nonparametric reconstruction presented in @xcite .",
    "as shown , our result is consistent with that in zhao  ( 2017 ) within @xmath92 cl .    to reinvestigate the tension among various datasets in dde models , we over - plot @xmath8 for the best fit dde model as parametrised by eq ( [ eq : osc ] ) ( black solid ) .",
    "as shown , it is consistent with all datasets , signalling a release of tension among datasets .    to assess whether the best fit @xmath2 model found in this work will be supported by future observations , we take the best fit @xmath2 model as a fiducial model , create mock bao and supernovae data assuming a desi @xcite and a future space - based supernova mission @xcite combined with _ planck _",
    "2015 data , and repeat our analysis .",
    "we find that for parametrisation i , models of @xmath93 will be supported by bayesian evidences , with a signal of @xmath9 at @xmath94 cl .",
    "although the @xmath95 models fit data better , they are not much preferred to the @xmath0cdm model even for the future data .",
    "on the other hand , future data support the oscillation model much more significantly .",
    "namely , those models will be detected at more than @xmath3 cl with a large bayesian factor of @xmath96 .",
    "we revisit the consistency among various kinds of recent observations using the @xmath8 diagnosis , and confirm that the tension exists among _ planck _ 2015 , gbao , ohd , ly@xmath59fb and the new @xmath57 measurement in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we therefore allow the dynamics of dark energy and perform parametric reconstruction of @xmath6 with two kinds of parametrisations using a combination of current datasets , and using the simulated future data .",
    "we find that an oscillatory @xmath6 across @xmath86 during the evolution is mildly favoured by a combination of current observations at a confidence level of @xmath90 based on the improvement in @xmath81 .",
    "this model can well relieve the tension among datasets .",
    "it is true that this is not sufficient for it to be supported by the bayesian evidence , however , for future galaxy surveys with a sensitivity similar to desi and space - based supernova surveys , the best - fit model derived in this work will be detected at a confidence level of @xmath3 , and will be decisively supported by the bayesian evidence .",
