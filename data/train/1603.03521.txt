    "dark energy is a synonym for a formalism which can describe the late time accelerated expansion of our universe @xcite . up to now",
    ", we have already known that a dark energy has a ( effective ) negative pressure ( or a negative equation of state ) and permeates the whole universe smoothly , please see @xcite and references therein for reviews . revealing the properties of dark energy strongly depends on the cosmic observations .",
    "since the property of dark energy mainly comes into the expansion rate of our universe , i.e. the hubble parameter @xmath8 , the geometrical measurements from the luminosity distance of type ia supernovae and the sound horizon of baryon acoustic oscillations can provide a constraint to the equation of state of dark energy . in the literature , to grasp the main properties and to avoid building a concrete dark energy model , for instance selecting a concrete potential form @xmath9 for a quintessence dark energy model , one chooses a parameterized equation of state of dark energy , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath0cdm model can be taken as the simplest extension to the @xmath11cdm model where @xmath12 is respected .",
    "now the dark energy issue is how to determine the values of @xmath0 at different redshift @xmath13 from cosmic observations . since this simplest parameterization of @xmath0 connects to the cosmic observations through the friedmman equation or the hubble parameter @xmath8 as a function of redshift @xmath13 , the geometric measurements , such as the luminosity distance of type ia supernovae @xcite , the position of the peaks of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite and gamma - ray bursts @xcite can constrain the values of @xmath0 . principally , more cosmic observations are needed to get a tighter constraint to the properties of dark energy , here its equation of state .    when the light rays pass through astronomical objects ( galaxies , cluster of galaxies ) , the cosmological gravitation field bends the paths traveled by light from distant source to us .",
    "these light paths respond to the distribution of mass .",
    "therefore , the positions of the source and the image are related through the simple lens equation .",
    "the information of the invisible matter can be deduced by making a thorough inquiry the relation between sources and images .",
    "if one can measure the redshifts of the source and lens , the velocity dispersion of the mass distribution , the separated image , then one might be able to infer the distribution of the mass in our universe . since the first discovery of the strong gravitational lensing in @xmath14 by walsh , carswell and weymann in 1979 @xcite",
    ", it has become a powerful probe in the study of cosmology .",
    "actually , in the last few years , the strong lensing systems have been used as useful probe to determine the cosmological model parameter space @xcite . up to now",
    ", the data points have amounted to @xmath1 as collected in ref .",
    "these @xmath1 strong lensing systems are complied from four surveys : slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s .",
    "the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) and the boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ) are spectroscopic lens surveys in which candidates are selected respectively from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) .",
    "boss has been initiated by upgrading sdss - i optical spectrograph @xcite .",
    "these data points allow us to investigate the properties of dark energy .",
    "strong gravitational lensing occurs whenever the source , the lens and the observer are so well aligned that the observer - source direction lies inside the so - called einstein ring of the lensing . to extract the geometric information from a strong lensing system",
    ", one should specify a lensing model connecting the source , the image .",
    "in fact , the geometric information can be derived is the ratio @xmath15 between two angular diameter distances @xmath16 ( the angular diameter distance between lens and source ) and @xmath17 ( the angular diameter distance between the observer and the source ) which has been adopted as an observable @xcite . in theory",
    ", this angular diameter distance reads @xmath18 for a spatially flat cosmology , where @xmath19 is the hubble constant and @xmath20 is the dimensionless expansion rate which depends on redshift @xmath13 and cosmological parameters @xmath21 . for the @xmath0cdm model considered in this paper , @xmath21 should be @xmath22 and the dimensionless expansion rate reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is dimensionless density parameter of matter , and @xmath25 is dimensionless density parameter of dark energy for a spatially flat cosmology .",
    "it is clear that the hubble parameter @xmath19 can not be constrained , once the ratio @xmath26 is adopted as cosmic observable .",
    "now we have only two cosmological model parameters , @xmath27 remained to be determined by the strong lensing systems .",
    "of course , the free model parameter would be increased for a specific lensing model .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the equation of state of dark energy by using @xmath1 strong lensing systems under the assumption of power - law density profile . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it also claimed that the strong lensing systems can not give a tight constraint to the density parameter of dark matter @xmath24 due to the possible narrow range of values of the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 was fixed to the best - fit value obtained by _",
    "planck_2013 in ref .",
    "it is clear that the results are limited . since",
    "the number of the strong lensing systems amounts to @xmath1 which is almost twice as much as that in before , one would like to see the constraining power for @xmath24 . on the other hand , once the power - law density profile is assumed , one would like to understand the degeneracy between @xmath24 and the power law index , and also the impact on the cosmological parameters due to the evolution of the power law index .",
    "this is the main motivation of this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] , we simply introduce strong gravitational lensing models : the sis model and power - law density profile model respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we will present constraint results to @xmath0cdm model using the sis model and power - law density profile models by relaxing the values of @xmath24 .",
    "we also study the impact on the cosmological parameters due to the different parameterization of @xmath28 and its degeneracy to @xmath24 in this section .",
    "conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to have the ratio of @xmath26 for a strong lensing system , one needs to specify a lensing model which relates the einstein radius to the projected mass density . in this paper",
    ", we will mainly focus on the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) or singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) profile @xcite and a generalized spherically symmetric power - law mass distribution model @xmath29 .",
    "the spherically symmetric power - law model was proposed to consider the possible deviation from the isothermal profile and its evolution with redshift due to the structure formation theory @xcite .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) is recovered when @xmath30 is respected . in the following part of this section",
    ", we will give a brief review of these two models .",
    "analysis of isothermal mass properties have been widely applied in statistical analysis of the lens @xcite . under the first order approximation ,",
    "sis model is a good choice to obtain mean parameters of galaxies in the statistical analysis .",
    "the einstein radius in sis model is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath33 is the speed of light .",
    "one introduces the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath34 and the velocity dispersion @xmath32 in the form of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a free model parameter . then if the observed values of the einstein radius and the velocity dispersion are obtained , one has the observed ratio easily @xmath37 here @xmath38 and @xmath34 are the einstein radius and the stellar velocity dispersion respectively ; @xmath33 is the speed of light . according to @xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath36 is in the range @xmath39 . in order to eliminate the effects and uncertainties caused by the free parameter @xmath36 , wang and one of us proposed to use the ratio @xmath40 as cosmic observations to constrain the cosmological model , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 denote the order numbers of the lensing systems used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", the effects and uncertainties caused by the free parameter @xmath36 are eliminated completely .",
    "but in this paper , @xmath36 together with the cosmological model parameters will be treated as a free model parameters .    when we obtain the observable @xmath43 from the observed values of the einstein radius @xmath38 and the velocity dispersion @xmath34 , the uncertainties are also introduced into the error budget .",
    "via the error propagation equation , one can derive the @xmath44 error for @xmath45 via the equation @xmath46 , \\label{eq : sigmasis}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the uncerteinties of @xmath38 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "fortunately , @xmath34 and @xmath48 can be obtained from observations . following the slacs team",
    ", we take @xmath50 error for @xmath38 and @xmath36 due to the fractional uncertainty of the einstein radius at the level of @xmath50 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be seen that choose @xmath47 the level of @xmath50 is reasonable , see also in ref .",
    "@xcite .      for a general power - law density profile model ,",
    "the mass density distribution is given by @xmath51 according to refs .",
    "since lensing mass inside the einstein radius is determined by @xmath38 , for a spherically symmetric lensing system , we can shift the coordinate origin to the centre of symmetry and reduce light deflection to a one - dimensional problem , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass enclosed within the radius @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the projected mass density for lensing . for the case of a einstein ring ,",
    "the mass @xmath56 inside einstein radius is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the physical einstein radius , and @xmath59 is the critical projected mass density @xmath60 thus the lens mass @xmath56 inside the einstein radius reads @xmath61 after solving spherical jeans equation , one can assess the dynamical mass inside the aperture projected to lens plane and scale it to the einstein radius @xmath62 where @xmath63 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and @xmath64 is the velocity dispersion inside the aperture .",
    "the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath34 is given by @xcite @xmath65 by setting @xmath66 , one obtains @xmath38 @xmath67 now we have the observable in the power - law density profile model @xmath68 in this model , the @xmath44 error of @xmath69 comes from the uncertainties of @xmath64 and @xmath38 following ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath70 , \\label{eq : sigmapl}\\ ] ] here we also take @xmath50 error for @xmath38 , and the variance of @xmath64 has presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the mass density power - law index @xmath3 of massive elliptical galaxies evolves with respect to redshift @xcite . and a linear relation with @xmath71 was assumed @xmath72 by combining the lensing sample from slacs , sl2s and lsd .",
    "here we just quote the results in the case of @xmath0cdm model obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath1 lensing systems were used under the assumption of a fixed best - fit value of @xmath24 obtained by _ planck_2013 .",
    "although , by this assumption , a relative tighter constraint to the equation of sate of dark energy could be obtained as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results and conclusion are limited to the special case .",
    "more importantly , one would like to see the power in constraining cosmological model beyond the only equation of sate of dark energy , say @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we would like to know the possible degeneracy between @xmath24 and @xmath3 , and the possible dependence of cosmological model parameter space on the parameterzied forms of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in this work , we choose two parameterized forms of @xmath3 : @xmath75 to study the parameterzied form dependence issue , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are free constant parameters .",
    "the model ii is inspired by the cpl dark energy model which was already taken as a very nature taylor expansion at present , i.e. @xmath78 . as a comparison to model i , model ii is not divergent even at quite large redshift , although the lens distribute at relative low redshift . to see the constraining power to the cosmological model and the possible degeneracy between @xmath24 and @xmath3 ,",
    "we relax @xmath24 as a free cosmological parameter .",
    "to obtain the model parameter space , we perform a global fitting via the markov chain monte carlo method which is based on the publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite . the posterior likelihood @xmath79 $ ] is given by calculating the @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath21 is the model parameter vector , @xmath41 denotes the @xmath41th strong lensing system , @xmath82 is the corresponding @xmath44 variance of @xmath83 .",
