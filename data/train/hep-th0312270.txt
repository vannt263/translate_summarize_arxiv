    "in recent years , there has been strong interest in the dynamics of the quantum fields out of equilibrium appearing in the evolution of the early universe or in the process of phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the formation of topological defects , the dynamics of inflation of the universe , and the inflationary reheating have been studied on the basis of scalar field model .",
    "the domain formation and growth  @xcite were studied in the out of equilibrium second order phase transition using the hartree - fock approximation . during a second order phase transition , the time scale of relaxation of the scalar field lags behind the time scale of change of the effective potential .",
    "consequently , the field evolves out of equilibrium as it tries to relax to a new vacuum , giving rise to a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "such nonequilibrium effects play a crucial role in topological defect formation in condensed matter systems as well as in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "kibble first showed how the correlation length is crucial in determining the initial density of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "these ideas were elaborated by zurek who proposed that it may be possible to quantitatively test the kibble mechanism of defect formation in condensed matter systems such as superfluid he@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "he argued that , because of the phenomenon of critical slowing down near the phase transition point , the correlation length relevant for determining the initial density of the defects is not the equilibrium correlation length at the ginzburg temperature but that at the time when the field dynamics essentially freezes out .",
    "he also found a power law behavior in the dependence of the correlation length on the quench rate .",
    "there have been various attempts to experimentally test the kibble - zurek prediction of initial defect density  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review on these issues is given in ref .",

    "one crucial lesson provided by these studies is the importance of using time - dependent techniques to study processes of the system with explicit time - dependence .",
    "it has been repeatedly shown that classical and one - loop effective potentials are poorly defined and of little use in such dynamical systems .",
    "another common theme is the importance of non - linear corrections to the linear dynamics . in these directions ,",
    "the dynamics of spinodal decomposition in inflationary cosmology using the closed time path formalism of quantum field theory out of equilibrium combined with the non - perturbative hartree approximation was analyzed in ref .",
    "a feature common to all such phase transitions is the evolution far away from equilibrium and the exponential growth of the soft ( long wavelength ) modes , which necessarily lead to domain growth .",
    "finite temperature field theory based on equilibrium or quasi - equilibrium methods does not describe all the processes of nonequilibrium evolution even though the imaginary part of the complex effective action yields the decay rate  @xcite . to treat such nonequilibrium quantum evolution properly , schwinger and keldysh first introduced the closed - time formalism  @xcite . the closed - time formalism and the @xmath3 expansion method have been applied to nonequilibrium @xmath1 theory to explain the phenomenon of domain growth  @xcite .",

    "the renormalization of field theory in quenched second order phase transitions was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in this context .",
    "an obstacle in discussing the phase transition of the scalar field in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions is that there is no symmetry breaking in the gaussian effective potential of the theory with the precarious renormalization  @xcite , which is the only relevant renormalization scheme which does not require non - trivial assumptions such as the existence of a large momentum cutoff , large @xmath4 limit of @xmath5 scalar field , or the autonomous renormalization  @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "most of these studies consider the region in which the phase transition begins , where the dynamical behavior of the unstable modes are the main interest .",
    "it is an interesting question to which vacuum the system will settle down after the transition since there is no vacuum with non - zero order parameter in the static theory described by the effective potential . in this paper",
    "we answer this question by showing that the vacuum structure of the scalar field theory changes when the second order phase transition occurs .",

    "some exactly solvable models of the free scalar field were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it was proposed that the exponential growth of the spinodal instability may ends at the spinodal line because of the back - reaction of the scalar field .",
    "the spinodal instability leads to the domain formation and growth  @xcite , which is determined by the equal time correlation functions .",
    "the formation and growth of the domains were studied up to the point where the phase transition process ends .",
    "it is generally believed that the domain becomes static once it is formed without other dynamics involved . in this paper , by studying the spatial correlation functions determined by the approximation method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that there exists another propagating correlations after the transition process is over in addition to the static domain .",
    "recently , the present authors have developed a new quartic exponential type variational approximation  @xcite which is suitable for double well type potentials in the quantum mechanical context .",
