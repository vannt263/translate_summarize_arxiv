    "two - players infinite games have been much studied in set theory and in descriptive set theory , see @xcite . in particular , if @xmath5 is a ( countable ) alphabet having at least two letters and @xmath6 , then the gale - stewart game @xmath7 is an infinite game with perfect information between two players .",
    "player 1 first writes a letter @xmath8 , then player 2 writes a letter @xmath9 , then player 1 writes @xmath10 , and so on @xmath11 after @xmath1 steps , the two players have composed an infinite word @xmath12 of @xmath13 .",
    "player 1 wins the play iff @xmath14 , otherwise player 2 wins the play .",
    "the game @xmath7 is said to be determined iff one of the two players has a winning strategy .",
    "a fundamental result of descriptive set theory is martin s theorem which states that every gale - stewart game @xmath7 , where @xmath15 is a borel set , is determined @xcite .    on the other hand , in computer science ,",
    "the conditions of a gale stewart game may be seen as a specification of a reactive system , where the two players are respectively a non terminating reactive program and the  environment \" .",
    "then the problem of the synthesis of winning strategies is of great practical interest for the problem of program synthesis in reactive systems .",
    "in particular , if @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is here a finite alphabet , and @xmath15 is effectively presented , i.e. accepted by a given finite machine or defined by a given logical formula , the following questions naturally arise , see @xcite : ( 1 )   is the game @xmath7 determined ?   ( 2 )",
    "if player 1 has a winning strategy , is it effective , i.e. computable ?",
    "( 3 )   what are the amounts of space and time necessary to compute such a winning strategy ?",
    "bchi and landweber gave a solution to the famous church s problem , posed in 1957 , by stating that in a gale stewart game @xmath7 , where @xmath15 is a regular @xmath1-language , one can decide who the winner is and compute a winning strategy given by a finite state transducer , see @xcite for more information on this subject . in @xcite thomas and lescow asked for an extension of this result where @xmath15 is no longer regular but deterministic context - free , i.e. accepted by some deterministic pushdown automaton .",
    "walukiewicz extended bchi and landweber s theorem to this case by showing first in @xcite that that one can effectively construct winning strategies in parity games played on pushdown graphs and that these strategies can be computed by pushdown transducers .",
    "notice that later some extensions to the case of higher - order pushdown automata have been established @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we first address the question ( 1 ) of the determinacy of gale - stewart games @xmath7 , where @xmath15 is a context - free @xmath1-language accepted by a ( non - deterministic ) pushdown automaton , or even by a @xmath0-counter automaton .",
    "notice that there are some context - free @xmath1-languages which are ( effective ) analytic but non - borel @xcite , and thus the determinacy of these games can not be deduced from martin s theorem of borel determinacy . on the other hand ,",
    "martin s theorem is provable in zfc , the commonly accepted axiomatic framework for set theory in which all usual mathematics can be developed .",
    "but the determinacy of gale - stewart games @xmath7 , where @xmath15 is an ( effective ) analytic set , is not provable in zfc ; martin and harrington have proved that it is a large cardinal assumption equivalent to the existence of a particular real , called the real @xmath16 , see @xcite .",
    "we prove here that the determinacy of gale - stewart games @xmath7 , whose winning sets @xmath15 are accepted by real - time @xmath0-counter bchi automata , is equivalent to the determinacy of ( effective ) analytic gale - stewart games and thus also equivalent to the existence of the real @xmath16 .",
    "next we consider wadge games which were firstly studied by wadge in @xcite where he determined a great refinement of the borel hierarchy defined via the notion of reduction by continuous functions , see definition [ defiwadgegames ] below for a precise definition .",
    "these games are closely related to the notion of reducibility by continuous functions . for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 is said to be wadge reducible to @xmath20 iff there exists a continuous function @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 ; this is then denoted by @xmath23 . on the other hand , the wadge game @xmath24 is an infinite game with perfect information between two players , player 1 who is in charge of @xmath19 and player 2 who is in charge of @xmath20 . and it turned out that player 2 has a winning strategy in the wadge game @xmath24 iff @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that the determinacy of borel gale - stewart games implies the determinacy of borel wadge games . on the other hand , louveau and saint - raymond",
    "have proved that this latter one is weaker than the first one , since it is already provable in second - order arithmetic , while the first one is not .",
    "it is also known that the determinacy of ( effective ) analytic gale - stewart games is equivalent to the determinacy of ( effective ) analytic wadge games , see @xcite .",
    "we prove in this paper that the determinacy of wadge games between two players in charge of @xmath1-languages accepted by @xmath0-counter bchi automata is equivalent to the ( effective ) analytic wadge determinacy , and thus also equivalent to the existence of the real @xmath16 .",
    "then , using some recent results from @xcite and some results of set theory , we prove that , ( assuming zfc is consistent ) , one can effectively construct a @xmath0-counter bchi automaton @xmath2 and a bchi automaton @xmath3 such that : ( 1 ) there exists a model of zfc in which player 2 has a winning strategy in the wadge game @xmath4 ; ( 2 ) there exists a model of zfc in which the wadge game @xmath4 is not determined .",
    "moreover these are the only two possibilities , i.e. there are no models of zfc in which player 1 has a winning strategy in the wadge game @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is an extended version of a conference paper which appeared in the proceedings of the 29 th international symposium on theoretical aspects of computer science , stacs 2012 , @xcite .",
    "it contains the full proofs which could not be included in the conference paper due to lack of space .    notice that as the results presented in this paper might be of interest to both set theorists and theoretical computer scientists , we shall recall in detail some notions of automata theory which are well known to computer scientists but not to set theorists . in a similar way we give a presentation of some results of set theory which are well known to set theorists but not to computer scientists .",
