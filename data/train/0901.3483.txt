    "the otelo project @xcite is a flux  limited survey of emission ",
    "line objects in large and perfectly defined volumes of the universe .",
    "the otelo survey , more than one magnitude deeper than other emission line surveys , includes a wide variety of astronomical sources : star  forming galaxies , starburst galaxies , emission  line ellipticals , agns , qsos , ly@xmath0 emitters , peculiar stars , etc . with these data ,",
    "a number of scientific problems will be addressed , including : star formation rates ( sfr ) and metallicity evolution of galaxies ; agn and qso evolution .",
    "deep imaging programs such as several vlt surveys for goods @xcite , cosmos @xcite and sxds @xcite fields will serve as preparatory work for otelo .",
    "likewise , we have performed a deep bvri broadband survey in one of the fields of the groth strip selected for the otelo survey @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "data from this broad band survey is combined with other wavelength data for achieving several objectives of the otelo project . specifically , the matching of these optical data with x  ray allows succesfully tackling the study of the agn population as shown in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "optical imaging surveys allow a morphological classification of all sufficiently resolved sources .",
    "this is essential to reveal the nature of agn host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the morphological classification becomes difficult at high redshift , due to the reduced resolution of images .",
    "several works @xcite have shown that the agns are directly related with some host galaxy properties , particularly with their bulges . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that the agns in the local universe are hosted predominantly in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "more recently , @xcite using hst and _ chandra _ data of the goods south field has found that the most moderate luminosity agns hosts are bulge - dominated in the redshift range z@xmath10.41.3 .",
    "a tight correlation between black hole mass and the bulge dispersion velocity has been well established @xcite , as well as with the concentration of bulges @xcite .    on the other hand , deep x ",
    "ray extragalactic surveys are extremely useful tools to investigate the time evolution of the population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and to shed light on their triggering mechanisms .",
    "the exceptional effectiveness at finding agn arises largely because x  ray selection has reduced absorption bias , minimal dilution by host - galaxy starlight and allows efficient optical spectroscopic follow - ups of high probability agn candidates with faint optical counterparts .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observatories have revolutionized this field of research , generating the most sensitive x ",
    "ray surveys ever performed .",
    "in fact , deep surveys produced by these observatories have increased the resolved fraction of the cosmic x ",
    "ray background ( cxrb ) to about 90% in the 0.52 kev range . a large part of the detected x",
    " ray sources are agn ( @xmath2 70% ) , although x  ray emitters include a mix of different types of objects such as galaxy clusters and stars . on the other hand ,",
    "these powerful observatories make it possible to access the hard ( 210 kev ) range , allowing to directly probe the agn activity not contaminated by star formation processes .",
    "moreover , hard x  ray surveys are capable to detect all but the most absorbed ( compton thick ) sources .",
    "therefore , they provide the most complete and unbiased samples of agns @xcite .",
    "number counts relations have now been determined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although with some evidence for field - to - field variations .",
    "such variations are expected at some level owing to `` cosmic statistics '' associated with large - scale structures and clustering features that have been detected in the x  ray sky @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of public , deep ( 200 ksec ) /acis observations of three fields comprising the original groth - westphal strip ( gws ) , gathered from the chandra data archive , and combined with optical bvri data from our broadband survey carried out with the 4.2 m william - herschel telescope ( wht ) at la palma ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we have tried to implement an innovative approach to the optical study of x  ray emitters by investigating correlations between broadband optical and x  ray parameters , specifically the x  ray - to - optical ratio and hardness ratios , and optical structural parameters that provide information about the host galaxy morphology and populations , like asymmetry and concentration indexes and optical colors .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ observational_data ] , we describe the observational data , including x  ray data processing and source detection , as well as optical broadband data and the selection of the sample of x  ray sources with optical counterparts .",

    "the ` faint ` and ` vfaint ` telemetry modes have been used , with telemetry saturation rates of 170 and 67 events / s , respectively . due to the lack of bright sources within the fields ,",

    "standard reduction procedures have been applied , as described in the ciao science threads to produce new level 2 event files .",
    "the output level 2 event files have been restricted to the 0.58kev range to avoid high background spectral regions .",

    "we have applied a simple criterion for performing a coarse nuclear  type classification of our sample objects , based on diagnostic diagrams relating x  ray - to - optical ratios ( x / o ) to hardness ratios ( hr ) .",
    "this criterion is based on the results of @xcite on the bright serendipitous survey ; they found that , when plotting the hr@xmath57 ( equivalent to our hr@xmath20 ) against x / o , computed as the ratio of the observed x  ray flux in the 0.5 - 4.5kev ( soft+hard2 ) energy range and the optical r - band flux , most ( 85% ) of the blagn identified by means of optical spectroscopy are tightly packed in a small rectangular region of the diagram , while nlagn ( type 2 ) tend to populate a wide area of the diagram ( towards harder values of the hardness ratio ) .",
    "we applied the same approach to our sample , combining the hr@xmath20 hardness ratio with the x / o ratio , where the optical flux @xmath58 has been derived from the petrosian magnitudes in the r band .",

    "nevertheless , we can see that the majority of objects identified as compact ( 65% ) are placed in the blagn region .",
    "it is also interesting to highlight the relationship between the x / o ratio and the host galaxy morphology , with early - type galaxies having generally lower values for x / o ratio and an opposite behavior of late - type objects . finally , we find that only about 7% of our sample objects are placed in the lower region of the diagram ( i.e. that typical of stars / normal galaxies / compton - thick agn ) .",
    "we also represented the x / o ratio with respect to hr@xmath18 , yielding a basically identical distribution as that described above , and with respect to hr@xmath21 and hr@xmath22 , observing that in these two cases is harder to get a clear separation between different nuclear / morphological types ; this behavior is expected since hardness ratios computed from the hard and vhard bands are less sensitive to absorption than those involving the soft band , which is one of the main criteria for the separation between broad and narrow line agn .",

    "first of all , it is not easy to disentangle possible bias effects that superimposed to variable seeing conditions .",
    "it has been pointed out the existence of redshift - dependent biases in both a and c , due to the reduction of apparent size and surface brightness with respect to the sky background with increasing z , along with poorer sampling and lower s / n @xcite ; on the other hand , there is a `` bandpass shift '' with respect to the rest wavelength @xcite . even if these effects combine to produce some uncertainty in the morphological classification of galaxies , generally in the sense of shifting objects to apparently later hubble types ( i.e. with lower c values ) , a and c seems to be reproducible out to z=3 , within a reasonable scatter @xcite .",
    "moreover , there can be a truly evolutionary effect in the agn host galaxies , indicating that galaxies at higher redshift are intrinsically less concentrated @xcite .    at this stage",
    "we can not apply any correction which depends on the redshift , although this is one of the objectives for the future work .",
    "however , we have performed a preliminary evaluation by representing the concentration index c versus the spectroscopic redshifts z gathered from the deep2 catalog for 84 objects from our sample . while for non compact objects we obtained an anticorrelation between these two parameters , c and z are found uncorrelated for compact objects , in clear contrast with the observed behavior in figure  [ xo_c ] .",
    "so , although the biases described above might contribute partially to it , the observed anticorrelation seems to also be a result of a true physical effect .",
    "in order to attempt to explain it , we have first to understand the physical connections of the two observables c and x / o . the concentration index ( c ) is tightly linearly correlated to the central velocity dispersion @xcite , which is in turn related to the nuclear black hole ( bh ) mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the concentration and the nuclear bh mass ( m@xmath60 ) are correlated .",
    "the physical connections of the x  ray to optical flux ratio are not so evident .",
    "the x / o ratio measures the x  ray flux ( in the 0.5 - 4.5kev band ) , normalized with the r - band optical flux of the whole galaxy ( nucleus , bulge and disk ) .",
    "it should be noted that no bandpass , or k - correction is performed ; therefore if the sample spans a large redshift range the interpretation of the quantity becomes more problematic .",
    "if the nuclear luminosity is large compared with that of the host galaxy , x / o ratio can be thought as a measure of the x  ray to optical spectral index , @xmath61 .",
    "this parameter has been found to be strongly anticorrelated with the uv luminosity l@xmath62 , without a significant correlation with redshift @xcite . on",
    "the other hand @xcite found a strong correlation between the hard / soft x  ray spectral index , @xmath63 and the eddington ratio in a sample of 41 blagn and narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies observed with asca .",
    "other works have confirmed this correlation @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath63 and @xmath64 has not been thoroughly studied in large samples of agn , but a linear correlation has been found between both spectral indexes in a sample comprising 22 out of 23 quasars in the complete the palomar - green x  ray sample with z@xmath530.4 and m@xmath65@xmath53 - 23 @xcite . if this last correlation holds for our sample , x / o could be tracing the eddington ratio in the large nuclear luminosity limit .",
    "in addition , if the host galaxy luminosity is large when compared with the nuclear luminosity ( @xmath66 ) , the x / o ratio can be thought as a lower bound of the x  ray - to - bulge luminosity ratio , that is in turn a ( weak ) measure of the agn eddington ratio @xmath67 , assuming that the x  ray luminosity represents the nuclear luminosity and the bulge luminosity is proportional to the bulge mass ( and therefore to m@xmath60 ) .",
    "hence , we can guess a ( loose ) correlation between x / o and the energy production efficiency of the agn . under these assumptions , the c vs. x",
    "/ o relation traces the correlation between the eddington ratio and the nuclear bh mass .",
    "the obtained result could therefore suggest that early - type galaxies , having poor matter supply to feed the activity , have lower eddington rates than those of late - type , with larger reserves of the gas for agn feeding .",
    "this suggested approach is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite in a sample of x  ray selected agns at z@xmath551 .",
    "they observed that a large fraction of low - luminosity agns are fed by black holes with a mass m@xmath60@xmath523@xmath310@xmath68m@xmath69 , and eddington rate @xmath70 1 , while a small ( @xmath5310% ) fraction of agns host small smbh ( m@xmath60@xmath5310@xmath68m@xmath69 ) and eddington rate @xmath12 1 , which corresponds to a more efficient accretion rate .",
    "they stated that their results strongly suggest that most of the low - luminosity x ",
    "ray selected agns ( at least up to z@xmath550.8 ) are powered by rather massive black holes , experiencing a low - level accretion in a gas - poor environment .",
    "our approach is also consistent with the results of @xcite , who studied the black hole masses and eddington rates of a sample of 135 double  peaked broad line agns , observed in two surveys : sdss and a survey of blagn radio emitters .",
    "they obtained that if the separation between the line peaks ( which is correlated to the smbh mass ) decrease , the eddington rate increases .",
    "@xcite found an anticorrelation between the mass of a smbh and the luminosity ratio of infrared to active galactic nuclei eddington luminosity , l@xmath71/l@xmath72 , for a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with type 1 seyfert nuclei ( type 1 ulirgs ) and nearby qsos , which also could be consistent with our approach .",
    "the anticorrelation is interpreted as a link between the mass of a smbh and the rate of mass accretion onto a smbh , normalized by the agn eddington rate , which indicates that the growth of the black hole is determinated by the external mass supply process , and not the agn eddington - limited mechanism , changing its mass accretion rate from super - eddington to sub - eddington .",

    "we have neither found substantial differences between the clustering of soft and hard2 selected x  ray sources , nor when comparing the populations of type 1 and type 2 agn ( i.e. unobscured and obscured agn , respectively ) , separated using the hr@xmath57@xmath12 - 0.35 boundary .",
    "the clustering analysis of the optical counterparts of our x  ray emitters provides a correlation length significantly larger than the one found for the whole galaxy population with the same limiting magnitude , and same field , but similar to that of strongly clustered populations like red and very red ( bulge - dominated ) galaxies .",
    "a clustering signal @xmath105 was observed even at @xmath106 arcsec , which corresponds to 160 @xmath107 kpc , assuming a mean redshift of 0.85 for _ chandra _ extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "this comoving distance is , for instance , comparable to the separation of two mergers in the t@xmath122 gyr stage of their large - scale evolution , according to the model of @xcite on rapid formation of smbh .",
    "hence , our results suggest that the environment plays an important ( but not unique ) role as possible triggering mechanism of agn phenomena .",
    "this fact can be perfectly compatible with the interpretation given to the anticorrelation between x / o ratio and the concentration index .",
    "the former may be associated to the genesis of the agns , while the anticorrelation could be that to their maintenance and evolution .",
