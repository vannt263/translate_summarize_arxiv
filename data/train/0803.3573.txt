    "<S> this odd behavior of the friedel phase has consequences in the charge through the friedel sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if the energy of the bic drops under the fermi energy the charge changes abruptly in a unity . we show that this behavior closely relates with discontinuities in the conductance predicted for interacting quantum dot systems .    in a early work </S>",
    "<S> , von neumann and wigner @xcite showed that for certain local potentials , the schrdinger equation has exact solutions with energy eigenvalues above the continuum threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials can be constructed in one dimension by a method suggested in the same article . much later , several theoretical and experimental works show the existence of these `` bound states in the continuum '' ( bics ) in different contexts . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is shown that these states can occur in a system of coupled square well potentials for appropriate values of the well depths and coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> stillinger and herrick corrected and extended von neumann work to consider systems in two dimensions @xcite , constructing some potentials leading to bics . </S>",
    "<S> friedrich and wintgen demonstrated that bics occur in natural way , not only for specific potentials , when two resonances associated with different channels interfere @xcite . in transport through mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems , there are theoretical works showing the formation of these states in a four - terminal junction @xcite , in a ballistic channel with intersections zhen - li , and more recently , bound states in the continuum have been theoretically discussed for systems of quantum dots ghost , rotter , ordonez , triple . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of bics in open quantum billiards with variable shape is discussed in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the density of states ( dos ) is of great relevance to understand transport phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the dos is related to the scattering matrix @xmath0 via the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) , which can be stated as @xmath1 where the friedel phase @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where the phase shifts @xmath4 are obtained from the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix @xmath0 , @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fsr has been central in the understanding of the behavior of impurities in metals @xcite , but recently has received considerable attention in the context of low dimensional systems @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is shows that the transmission phase can change abruptly in @xmath6 while the friedel phase remains continuous as a function of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission phase discontinuity is characteristic of single electron transport and accompanies the vanishing of the transmission amplitude @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to bring into discussion the behavior of the friedel phase in the presence of bics in the context of electronic transport through quantum dots . by bic we mean a resonance that , as consequence of quantum interference , becomes infinitely narrow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these states are characterized by delta - shaped densities of states , the friedel phase , according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ friedelphase ] ) , is discontinuous as a function of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> we present results of two particular systems : a parallel - coupled double quantum dot molecule @xcite and two quantum dots side - attached to a quantum wire , and we discuss the consequences that such a discontinuity has on the conductance in presence of electron - electron interactions . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](b ) we assume two quantum dots with energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 side - attached to the same site of a quantum wire , with equal coupling constants , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance in this case exhibits a breit - wigner and two fano resonance around @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . when the energies of the quantum dot levels are equal , that is @xmath28 , one of the resonances disappears for the arising of a bic @xcite </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath19 gets larger , that is , we go from a configuration in series to a parallel one , the friedel phase changes more steeply around the energy of the bonding state , @xmath49 . in the limit @xmath50 </S>",

    "<S> the lower panel shows the corresponding density of states . this in general is a superposition of two lorentzians at the molecular energies , with broadenings @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the configuration in series , </S>",
    "<S> the two states have the same width . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath53 approaches to @xmath21 , one of the peaks becomes progressively narrower than the other , as shown in figures ( b ) and ( c ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( lower panel ) shows the corresponding density of states . as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , when @xmath58 , as in ( b ) and ( c ) , the dos can be approached by a sum of two lorentzians of widths @xmath59 and @xmath60 centered at @xmath57 .    in summary , for any of the considered systems , the density of states when @xmath61 can be written as a superposition of a lorentzian and a dirac delta function @xmath62 where @xmath63 for the parallel - coupled double quantum dot molecule , and @xmath64 for the side - coupled quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> integrating the above equation in the energy @xmath65 we obtain the friedel phase @xmath66 this equation describes correctly the abrupt jump exhibited by @xmath2 in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , in the presence of a bic . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fsr ] ) allows to obtain the charge @xmath67 in the quantum dots , @xmath68where @xmath69 is the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath70 falls below the fermi energy , the charge in the system formed by the two dots increases abruptly in an unit . </S>",
    "<S> this discontinuity in the charge in presence of a bic should have an effect in the conductance when the electron - electron interactions are taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a generic system exhibiting bics , which could be two quantum dots in parallel , and let us treat the interaction by the mean field approximation of the anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> in this approximation , the energy levels of the quantum dots are renormalized , that is , if the energies of the quantum dots are @xmath71 , the interaction moves them to @xmath72 . then , if @xmath73 falls below the fermi energy , the jump in @xmath74 produced in @xmath75 according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ charge ] ) will shift the renormalized energy @xmath76 in @xmath77 , with consequences in the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the conductance can be written in terms of the renormalized energy as @xmath78 if the quantum dots are initially empty , and if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 but if @xmath81 @xmath82 thus , @xmath83 suffers a discontinuity at @xmath84 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ conduct ] .    in the absence of interaction </S>",
    "<S> the conductance profile is a lorentzian ( solid line ) . if @xmath85 , when the fermi energy crosses the bic ( in @xmath86 ) the resonance shifts in @xmath77 , as shown for @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( dash y dotted line , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the sudden filling of a bic , as described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ charge ] ) , shifts the energy of the transmitting state , with the subsequent arising of a discontinuity in the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> this rough description allows to gain more insight of the results shown by bsser _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in multilevel quantum dots in kondo regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors found similar discontinuities in the conductance as the gate voltage was varied , when a localized state crossed the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> these localized states are a many - body version of the bound states in the continuum discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is analogous to that of a charge sensing described in @xcite , but in the present scheme , the sensed charge is that of a bic inside the proper system .    in summary , we have studied the behavior of the friedel phase in quantum dots systems when bics are produced . </S>",
    "<S> this phase exhibits an abrupt change when these states arise , effect with consequences in the charge of the system , which jumps in a unity when the energy of the bic drops below the fermi energy . </S>"
