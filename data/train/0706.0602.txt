    "the close interplay between charge dynamics and magnetism is a basic feature of the manganites a@xmath4b@xmath9mno@xmath10 ( a = la , nd , bi , ce ; b = sr , ca ) , as well as the starting point for any description of their rich phase diagram .",
    "it originates from the mixed valence of mn ions , which can transfer both charge and spin between their states mn@xmath3 and mn@xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "in many manganites the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase coincides with a metallic state and is characterized by a negative magnetoresistance .",
    "long time ago , this phenomenon was successfully explained in terms of the mn@xmath3 - o@xmath12 - mn@xmath11 charge - transfer mechanism , called double - exchange @xcite . due to the hund s rule",
    ", this transfer occurs only if the core spin of mn@xmath3 is aligned with that of mn@xmath11 , namely if the electron travels in a ferromagnetic environment .",
    "otherwise , a hund s energy of about 2 ev must be paid , as for example one observes in a manganite which switches at the nel temperature from an fm to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase @xcite .",
    "however , the double - exchange mechanism is found to dominate only in a narrow range of hole doping @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath14 phase diagram of these compounds also includes paramagnetic , fm insulating , af , as well as charge- and orbital - ordered phases@xcite .",
    "then , the original double - exchange model has been improved in the years by introducing superexchange , correlation , and polaronic@xcite effects .",
    "the formation of charge polarons in manganites is due to the jahn - teller distortion that the oxygen octahedra around the mn@xmath15 ions experience as they become mn@xmath3 by receiving an itinerant electron .",
    "even if this purely ionic picture is probably oversimplified , and both the electronic states and the jahn - teller distortions in mixed valence manganites are shared by different mn ions@xcite , this approach successfully explains their optical spectra@xcite .",
    "therefore , it will be substantially adopted also in the present work .    in the above framework ,",
    "the controlled substitution of the mixed - valence mn@xmath3 - mn@xmath11 ions by other elements has been considered for many decades as a powerful tool to understand in further detail the role of magnetic and translational order in the electrodynamics of manganites . since the pioneering work of goodenough and coworkers@xcite , oxides where mn was replaced by al , sc , ga , co , ni , etc . , have been obtained and studied by a variety of techniques@xcite .",
    "ga@xmath3 is one of the most suitable ions to that purpose . indeed , being its ionic radius ( 0.062 nm ) quite close to that of mn@xmath3 ( 0.0645 nm ) , ga@xmath3 replaces mn@xmath3 by leaving the manganite lattice only slightly perturbed@xcite and the mn@xmath11 concentration unaltered .",
    "however , the effect of ga on the properties of an fm manganite is dramatic , as it has neither a magnetic moment , nor @xmath16 electrons in the 3d orbital which may produce jahn - teller distortions .",
    "both in@xcite la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 and in@xcite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 , for increasing @xmath6 , the curie temperature @xmath17 decreases rapidly .",
    "the insulator - to - metal transition temperature @xmath18 drops even more sharply .",
    "both these effects have been attributed to the magnetic and topological disorder introduced by ga , as well as to its electrostatic potential@xcite .",
    "this is less attractive for a hole than that of an average mn ion , whose charge at 1/3 doping is + 3.3@xcite .    the phase diagram of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 is shown in fig .  [ diagram ] as it was reported in ref . . in the ga - free manganite a metallic fm phase ( fmm ) is established below @xmath17 = 380 k. by adding a small amount of ga @xmath17 starts to decrease , until the fm phase disappears for @xmath6 = 0.30 .",
    "anomalies in the behavior of the resistivity vs. temperature have suggested@xcite the existence of an intermediate , ferromagnetic insulating phase ( fmi ) between the paramagnetic insulator ( pmi ) and the fmm phase . a spin - glass phase ( sg )",
    "is also reported in the diagram beyond the @xmath19 range of the present investigation .",
    "infrared spectroscopy can independently observe the behavior of the free carriers and of the localized charges in different spectral regions .",
    "then , it may greatly help to understand the effects of ga substitution on the electrodynamics of a manganite . in the present study we have measured the reflectivity of five la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 samples , with increasing ga content from 0.0 to 0.30 , from 30 to 40000 @xmath20 and from 320 to 50 k. the ( @xmath21 ) coordinates of the experimental points",
    "are marked by red dots on the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "as far as we know , the only infrared spectrum of a ga - substituted manganite was recently published@xcite in a raman study of the phonon modes of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4m@xmath5o@xmath2 , with m = cr , co , cu , sc , zn , and ga .",
    "therein , the reflectivity of a sample with ga @xmath6 = 0.08 was measured from 80 to 1200 @xmath20 to obtain its dc conductivity .",
    "our study is aimed instead at observing the effect of increasing ga substitution on the free - carrier absorption ( drude term ) , on the phonon spectrum , on the mid - infrared bands , and on the electronic absorption in the near infrared .",
    "we could thus follow , on the whole excitation spectrum , and under controlled conditions , the destruction of a ferro - metallic phase and determine quantitatively the relationship between the magnetization and charge dynamics parameters like the plasma frequency , the effective mass , and the relaxation rate of the carriers .",
    "to our knowledge , all studies on ga - substituted manganites reported in the literature up to now concern polycrystalline materials .",
    "this is due to the difficulty to obtain a series of single crystals with different and controlled concentrations of ga , which must also be stoichiometric in oxygen . in optical measurements ,",
    "polished polycrystalline surfaces have been shown to provide an absolute mid - infrared reflectivity somewhat lower than in cleaved single crystals.@xcite this systematic error decreases as the metal is poorer and the reflectivity lower .",
    "for this reason , and being the present investigation aimed at comparing the behavior of samples with different ga content prepared exactly in the same way , this unavoidable limitation is expected to affect marginally our results .    here ,",
    "la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 samples with @xmath6 = 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.20 , and 0.30 were prepared in form of pellets and fully characterized as reported in ref . .",
    "the resistivity @xmath22 of the pellets selected for the optical measurements was also measured - except for the @xmath6 = 0.30 insulator - by a standard four - wire procedure .",
    "the results are reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] and are in substantial agreement with the previous , more detailed measurements of ref . on different pellets with corresponding doping levels .",
    "the reflectivity @xmath23 of the five samples was measured at nearly normal incidence after accurate polishing with sub - micron - thick powders .",
    "we used a rapid - scanning interferometer between 30 and 20000 @xmath20 and a grating monochromator from 16000 to 40000 @xmath20 .",
    "the former data were taken by thermoregulating the samples within @xmath24 2 k between 320 and 50 k , the latter ones at room temperature only .",
    "the reflectivity was then extrapolated both to zero and high frequency by use of accurate drude - lorentz fits .",
    "afterwards , @xmath25 was extracted from @xmath23 by standard kramers - kronig transformations .",
    "the measured reflectivity is shown in fig .",
    "[ refl ] at different temperatures for increasing ga content , from top to bottom . in the infrared @xmath23 , in agreement with the behavior of @xmath22 in the inset of fig .",

    "a strong band in the visible ( vis ) range is well evident in all samples .",
    "this band , with an edge just below 3 ev , is characteristic of manganites and is attributed to a charge - transfer transition between the o(2p ) and the mn(3d ) orbitals@xcite .",
    "the real part @xmath25 of the optical conductivity extracted from the @xmath23 of fig .",
    "[ refl ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] for all samples .",
    "therein , one can appreciate how the increasing ga content ( from top to bottom ) turns gradually the infrared spectrum of the metallic manganite into that of an insulator , while the electronic bands at higher energy do not change significantly .",
    "the low - frequency values of 1/@xmath25 follow qualitatively both the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath27 in fig .  [ diagram ] . any quest for",
    "a closer correspondence between those two quantities would be meaningless in view of the grain - boundary effects@xcite which affect the dc current in pellets .",
    "a feature common to all samples is the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energy for decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "this occurs around a very well defined isosbestic point , which softens as @xmath6 increases as shown by the arrows in the figure .    both samples in a ) and b ) with ga content 0.0 and 0.05 ,",
    "respectively , are metallic at all temperatures and their conductivity increases steadily upon cooling . as it will be discussed below , this effect is stronger than for an ordinary metal , where it is due to a simple reduction of the carrier scattering rate .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in c ) for @xmath6 = 0.10 , on a reduced conductivity scale .",
    "the shielding effect of the free carriers on the phonon lines here is also weaker than in a ) and b ) . in d ) the low - frequency conductivity is further reduced by more than a factor of 5 and the drude continuum is nearly replaced by the phonon spectrum .",
    "this latter shows new lines in addition to the usual three infrared - active bands of doped manganites ( see next section ) .",
    "the transition to an insulating state induced by ga is completed in the sample with @xmath6 = 0.30 in e ) .",
    "therein however , a very weak dc conductivity can again be appreciated below 100 k. the phonon spectrum of this insulating sample , like that of @xmath6 = 0.20 in c ) , exhibits strong satellite lines .",
    "moreover , a mid - infrared band centered at about 2000 @xmath20 appears at low @xmath26 .",

    "[ d - l ] to the data of fig .",
    "[ sigma ] are shown in fig .",
    "they illustrate two opposite cases at @xmath26 = 50 k : the @xmath42 of the metallic phase of @xmath6 = 0.05 ( a ) and that of the insulator @xmath6 = 0.30 ( b ) .",
    "the dotted line is the experimental @xmath42 , the black solid line the fitting curve , and the colored lines refer to the different contributions in eq .",
    "[ d - l ] . in the top panel",
    "one can easily distinguish the drude ( d ) , fir , mir , nir , and vis bands , in addition to weak phonon lines nearly shielded by the carrier background .",
    "these contributions are still present in the conductivity of the insulator ( b ) , except for the fir band .",
    "therein , the latter contribution is resolved into satellite modes ( red peaks ) of the main phonon lines ( in violet ) , as discussed below . in the following",
    "we will separately discuss those contributions to the conductivity for the five samples at all temperatures .",
    "the decomposition of the @xmath42 for the insulating sample with @xmath6 = 0.30 ( fig .",
    "[ fits]-b ) shows the usual three modes observed in most doped , pseudo - cubic , manganites : the external mode , here peaked at 152 @xmath20 , the bending of the oxygen octahedra at 298 @xmath20 , and their stretching at 590 @xmath20 .",
    "these frequencies do not change appreciably with temperature , at variance with observations in other manganites .",
    "for example in la@xmath43sr@xmath44mno@xmath2 all modes ( the bending in particular ) harden for decreasing temperature,@xcite and are sensitive to the magnetic transitions . in view of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 it is not surprising , therefore , if the phonons of the 0.30 sample does not exhibit major shifts with @xmath26 .",
    "as already mentioned , the effect of ga replacement manifests itself through satellite peaks which appear on both sides of the external and of the bending mode ( fig .",
    "[ fits]-b ) .",
    "these additional features are frequently observed in the insulating phases of doped oxides .",
    "they have been called either local modes or infrared active vibrations ( irav)@xcite and are attributed to the vibrations of cells where the polaronic charges are self - trapped .",
    "even when these ones are not numerous , irav s are observed due to the strong dipole moments associated with the vibrating polaron .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that , when they are observed in oxides at low doping , a polaronic band also appears in the mid infrared which exhibits the same @xmath26 dependence : namely , the intensity of both the mir band and the irav s rapidly increases as @xmath26 decreases and more and more charges are self - trapped . in this framework ,",
    "irav s and mir band correspond to transitions among the polaron internal states and to the free - carrier continuum , respectively .",
    "both those spectral features are observed also in the present case , as shown in fig .",

    "[ sigma]-e .",
    "the irav modes of fig .",
    "[ fits]-b are very similar to those observed in the insulating cuprates at low doping @xcite .",
    "therein , they collapse into a broad band in the far infrared as doping increases and the metallic phase is approached .",
    "a similar effect is observed at @xmath6 = 0.05 at 50 k ( fig .",
    "[ fits]-a ) where the introduction of a fir band , peaked at about 380 @xmath20 , is required by the fitting procedure .",
    "the fir band becomes negligibly small at room temperature .",
    "the optical parameters which characterize the metallic state are the plasma frequency of the carriers @xmath45 and their scattering rate @xmath46 .",
    "those obtained by the fits to eq .",
    "[ d - l ] are plotted vs. temperature in fig .",
    "[ drude ] for the four samples where the drude contribution can be appreciated at all temperatures .",

    "one may notice in fig .",
    "[ drude]-a that @xmath45 decreases with the ga content and exhibits a temperature dependence which is not observed in common metals .",
    "the following model may explain both these observations . in a simple one - band tight - binding model ,",
    "the spectral weight of the drude term , and then @xmath47 , is proportional to the hopping rate @xmath48 ( see , _",

    "the behavior of @xmath47 with @xmath26 at a given @xmath6 , and that of the mir band with @xmath6 at low @xmath26 , are shown to be directly governed by the magnetization , through a simple quadratic dependence .",
    "this finding also confirms that , in the spectrum of a metallic manganite , those absorption features are strictly related with each other .",
    "as it has been suggested theoretically@xcite , they represent the coherent and the incoherent part of a polaronic optical conductivity , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence of @xmath94 is mainly determined by a transfer of spectral weight from a band in the near infrared .",
    "this occurs around a very well defined isosbestic point whose frequency decreases for increasing @xmath6 .",
    "one should recall that a similar softening of the spectral weight for @xmath96 0 is observed in many systems characterized by strong electron - electron correlations@xcite .",
    "secondly , a linear increase with @xmath6 in the low - temperature drude linewidth @xmath46 was observed , and explained by a simple model which takes into account both the structural and the magnetic disorder induced by ga impurities .",
    "finally , the effective mass @xmath74 of the carriers , here monitored directly by the plasma frequency @xmath45 , was found to increase much more than linearly with @xmath6 : @xmath97 changes from 1.6 bare - electron masses in the ga - free sample , to about 35 electron masses as the system eventually turns into an insulator .",
    "such value indicates that the carriers , at @xmath6 = 0.30 , are small polarons .",
    "meanwhile , in the far infrared aside the phonon lines , satellite bands do appear which can be attributed to local modes of the cells distorted by the localized charges .    in summary ,",
    "the present optical spectra allowed us to monitor directly , at different energy scales , how an increasing dilution of the ferromagnetic order reflects in the charge dynamics of a metallic manganite , until it is eventually turned into an insulator at all temperatures .      c. zener , phys .",

    "<S> in a metallic manganite like la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , the substitution of mn@xmath3 by ga@xmath3 dilutes the ferromagnetic order and locally cancels the jahn - teller distortion , without heavily affecting the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus follow the changes in the charge dynamics induced by ga , until the ferro - metallic manganite is turned into an insulator . here </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is studied in detail through the infrared reflectivity of five samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath2 , with @xmath6 increasing from 0 to 0.30 and for @xmath7 k. a simple model which links the measured optical parameters to the magnetization @xmath8 well describes the behavior of the plasma frequency , the scattering rate , and the mid - infrared absorption along the metal - to - insulator transition .    </S>"
