    "in this work matter is described as a large ensemble of charged particles which interact via the gravitational and electromagnetic fields created by the particles themselves .",
    "all the particles have the same rest mass , normalized to @xmath4 , and the same charge @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of the particles on phase space is given by a density function @xmath6 .",
    "the particle ensemble is assumed to be collisionless which implies that @xmath6 satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "macroscopic quantities such as mass - energy density , pressure , and charge current , which act as source terms in the field equations , are obtained by integrating @xmath6 with respect to specific weight functions .",
    "the resulting system is called the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system and is stated in section  [ sectevms ] . in the present work we construct , by numerical means , static solutions of the asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov - maxwell system , and we investigate three different features of the solutions . in the chargeless case , i.e. , for the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov system , a similar study has been carried out in @xcite . there is an essential difference between these two systems concerning known mathematical results of existence of static solutions and their properties . in the chargeless case",
    "it is known that a wide variety of static solutions with finite extent and finite adm mass exist , cf .",
    "@xcite , and the references therein , whereas the problem of existence of static solutions in the charged case has not yet been studied .",
    "the mathematical construction of steady states in the chargeless case is based on a certain ansatz for the density function @xmath7 here this ansatz is modified to handle the charged situation , cf.section  [ stst ] .",
    "we believe that this constitutes a natural starting point for showing existence of static solutions of the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system , but we do not include such an analysis here since the purpose of the present paper is to investigate numerically three features of static solutions which we now describe in some detail .    in section  4 an analysis of the behavior of the energy density as a function of area radius is carried out for different values of the charge parameter @xmath8 .",
    "qualitatively we find a similar structure as in the chargeless case @xcite , e.g. there are solutions with an arbitrary number of peaks , and these peaks are separated either by vacuum or by a thin atmosphere .",
    "the choice of charge parameter affects in some cases the number of peaks . if the charge parameter reaches a certain critical value the solutions break down before the energy density vanishes .",
    "it is natural to compare this with the newtonian vlasov - poisson system for which there is no difference in the form of the equations whether one models a mono - charged plasma or a gravitating system , except for the sign in front of the force field .",
    "if one studies a charged gravitating system this sign is positive or negative depending on whether @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "steady states with finite extent only exists in the former case where the effective force field is attractive .",
    "this is in accordance with what we find in the relativistic situation .    in section  5",
    "we investigate if there are static solutions of the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system such that the inequality @xmath11 which was derived in @xcite , can be saturated in the sense that the quotient of the left and right hand side in ( [ pd ] ) is arbitrarily close to one .",
    "if there are such solutions we say that the inequality ( [ pd ] ) is sharp within this class of solutions . here",
    "@xmath1 is the adm mass , @xmath2 the total charge , and @xmath3 the area radius of the boundary of the static object .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that ( [ pd ] ) holds for any static solution of the einstein - maxwell - matter system which satisfies the energy condition @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radial and tangential pressures respectively and @xmath15 is the energy density .",
    "this condition is satisfied by vlasov matter .",
    "a suitable extension of the inequality ( [ pd ] ) also holds inside the static object , cf .",
    "@xcite and section  5 .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the inequality is sharp , and in particular that equality is attained by infinitely thin shell solutions .",
    "the method of proof in @xcite is quite general and applies to any matter model for which ( [ energy ] ) holds .",
    "however , the solution constructed in the analysis leading to sharpness has features which solutions of the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system do not have .",
    "hence , one motivation for the present study is to investigate if sharpness of the inequality can be attained by solutions when a real matter model is chosen so that the system of equations includes a matter field equation , in the case at hand the vlasov equation .",
    "in contrast to the chargeless case it is not known if there are solutions other than infinitely thin shells which saturate ( [ pd ] ) , and it is not known if arbitrarily thin shell solutions do exist for the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system .    in the uncharged case",
    "more is known .",
    "it follows from @xcite that infinitely thin shell solutions are _ unique _ in saturating the inequality ( [ pd ] ) for @xmath16 , i.e. , the inequality @xmath17 since an infinitely thin shell solution is not a regular solution of the einstein - matter system this statement should be interpreted in the sense that a sequence of regular solutions tending to an infinitely thin shell will in the limit give equality .",
    "moreover , it is known @xcite that regular arbitrarily thin shell solutions of the einstein - vlasov system do exist , which then in particular implies that there are steady states to this system such that @xmath18 is arbitrarily close to @xmath19    in the present work we find numerical evidence for answering the issues raised above . indeed",
    ", we construct arbitrarily thin shell solutions to the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system , which saturate the inequality ( [ pd ] ) in the limit . moreover , in contrast to the uncharged case we also find another type of solutions which saturate the inequality .",
    "these solutions have the feature that @xmath20 , and @xmath3 are all equal ; they represent an extremal object .",
    "the latter property may be of interest in fundamental black hole physics , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in section 6 the third and final property",
    "is investigated , namely the relation between the adm mass and the outer area radius of a one parameter family of steady states to the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "the one parameter family is obtained by prescribing the way in which @xmath6 depends on the local energy and the angular momentum , which we call the microscopic equation of state .",
    "we find numerical support for mass - radius spirals for all examples of the microscopic equation of state which we investigate .",
    "this agrees with the result in @xcite in the chargeless case , but on the other hand it differs from the newtonian situation where the presence of such spirals heavily depends on the microscopic equation of state . in @xcite the question",
    "of which equations of state in the fluid case give rise to spirals is investigated .    to conclude this introduction we mention @xcite where numerical investigations of solutions to the einstein - maxwell system are carried out using other conditions on the matter model .",
    "these studies focus on the issue of bounding @xmath1 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath21",
    "we choose general local coordinates @xmath22 on the spacetime manifold and we denote by @xmath23 the corresponding canonical momenta ; greek indices always run from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and latin ones from @xmath4 to @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 is a timelike coordinate and that @xmath27 can be expressed by @xmath28 through the condition that all the particles have rest mass normalized to @xmath4 : @xmath29 .",
    "then the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system takes the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 here and are the maxwell equations , are the einstein equations , is the vlasov equation , and @xmath32 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "we consider this system under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "hence the metric , expressed in schwarzschild coordinates , takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34,\\ \\varphi \\in [ 0 , 2\\pi].\\ ] ] for the metric to approach that of minkowski space as @xmath35 goes to infinity , the boundary conditions @xmath36 are imposed .",
    "furthermore , the condition @xmath37 ensures a regular center .",
    "we introduce the corresponding cartesian coordinates @xmath38 and find that @xmath39 here @xmath40 denotes the euclidean scalar product of the vectors @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the euclidean norm on @xmath43 . for a spherically symmetric electric field of the form",
    "@xmath44 the non - zero components of the electromagnetic field - strength tensor are @xmath45 let @xmath46 where @xmath47 the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be viewed as the momentum in the radial direction and the square of the angular momentum , respectively , expressed in a suitable frame .",
    "the system now reads @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 here a prime or dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath35 or @xmath53 , respectively , @xmath54 is the charge density , @xmath55 is the charge contained in the ball with area radius @xmath35 about the origin , @xmath56 is the energy density as defined when no charge is present , @xmath57 is the radial pressure , and the modulus of the electric field is given by @xmath58",
    "in this paper we are interested in static solutions , so reduces to @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . due to spherical symmetry",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is conserved along characteristics of the vlasov equation , and so is the particle energy @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 hence any density function of the form @xmath65 satisfies the static vlasov equation . in order to motivate ( [ edef ] )",
    "we combine the electric potential @xmath66 and the magnetic vector potential @xmath67 into a four - vector @xmath68 the electromagnetic field - strength tensor can be derived as @xmath69 in particular , @xmath70 i.e. , with the electric potential taken to be zero at @xmath71 , @xmath72 from this we get the particle energy @xmath73 as defined in ( [ edef ] ) .",
    "the ansatz ( [ fansatz ] ) is a generalization to the charged case of the standard ansatz for the einstein - vlasov system which is obtained for @xmath74 , and to the best of our knowledge it has not appeared in the literature .",
    "equations  can be rewritten as the system of ode s @xmath75 where the quantities @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are now functionals of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . in order to obtain a steady state with finite adm mass and finite extension",
    "we prescribe some cut - off energy @xmath80 and assume that @xmath81 for @xmath82 . taking this into account , @xmath83 where the upper limits @xmath84 and @xmath85 follow from the condition @xmath86 . since @xmath87 ,  can be solved if @xmath88 , @xmath8 , and @xmath89 are specified . in order to continue we",
    "introduce @xmath90 by making the ansatz @xmath91 ,  turn into @xmath92 where @xmath93 with upper limits for the integrals given by @xmath94 thus , since @xmath95 the dependence on @xmath89 is eliminated from the system of ode s  , and the equations can be solved after specifying merely @xmath96 and @xmath8 .",
    "notice that from the boundary conditions we require that @xmath97 as @xmath98 so that the limit of @xmath99 at infinity and ( [ eq : ydef ] ) determine @xmath89 .    for almost all numerical solutions presented below an ansatz of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 , has been used .",
    "here @xmath102 .",
    "our code does allow for a wide variety of ansatz functions , but the qualitative behavior is similar in all cases we have tried , cf .",
    "the end of section  6 . when using an ansatz with a cut - off @xmath103 for the square of the angular momentum as in , then at any point with @xmath104 the matter quantities  are zero .",
    "in particular the matter quantities will be zero and the functions @xmath105 will be constant for @xmath106 with @xmath107 the integrals in the matter quantities are calculated using the piecewise simpson s rule , and the differential equations are solved , from @xmath108 radially outwards , using the euler method with a variable step length @xmath109 , given at a point @xmath110 as @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the second derivative with respect to @xmath35 at @xmath113 , @xmath114 is an appropriately chosen maximum step length , and @xmath115 is euler s number .",
    "this implies that the code resolves those regions more finely where @xmath116 varies rapidly . in the chargeless case",
    "the integrals in and can be carried out explicitly for suitable ansatz functions @xmath117 , cf .",
    "@xcite , and we used the corresponding code to test the present one where these integrals are evaluated numerically .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of the uncharged energy density @xmath116 as a function of the area radius when the parameter for electric charge is varied .",
    "we find profiles which are multi - peaked , where the peaks are separated either by vacuum or a thin atmosphere . in this respect",
    "our results are qualitatively similar to the chargeless case , but the value of the charge parameter @xmath8 does affect the number of peaks in some cases . on the other hand , we find that for a sufficiently large value of the charge parameter there are no physically meaningful solutions .",
    "this is intuitively clear in view of the newtonian case where no steady states of finite mass exist when the effective force is repulsive .    the steady states for",
    "charged matter largely follow the same basic structures as noted in @xcite for the non - charged case , i.e. , we get steady states with support for @xmath116 in @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 , called shell configurations , and states where @xmath120 , called ball configurations .     and @xmath121 for a shell configuration ]    to visualize the steady states , for each quadruple",
    "@xmath122 a figure containing two subfigures is presented .",
    "subfigure ( a ) shows starting points , stopping points , i.e. , the inner and outer boundaries of the matter shells , as well as maxima of @xmath116 for @xmath123 , while subfigure ( b ) shows individual solutions for three values of @xmath8 , namely @xmath124 .",
    "the starting points in subfigure ( a ) are shown as dashed lines , the stopping points as solid lines and peaks are represented by dotted lines .",
    "the plots complement each other , the plot for the starting and stopping points contains little information on the shape of the steady states , while vacuum regions can be difficult to notice in the plots for individual solutions .",
    "to remedy the fact that peaks for @xmath116 closer to @xmath71 are in general much larger in magnitude than peaks farther out , @xmath125 rather than @xmath116 has been plotted against @xmath35 for the individual solutions .",
    "it should be borne in mind that this has the effect that the positions of ( and in one case also number of ) maxima in subfigures ( a ) and ( b ) differ .",
    "the most noticeable effect of changing the particle charge @xmath8 is that as @xmath8 approaches a critical value @xmath126 , the outer radius @xmath3 of the support for @xmath116 increases dramatically , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : doublefig11 ] and [ fig : doublefig08][fig : doublefig03 ] .",
    "intuitively , this is expected , since for some value of @xmath8 , the repulsive forces between individual particles from electric charge balances the attractive forces of gravity . for values of @xmath8 larger than @xmath126 ,",
    "the numerical solution breaks down since at some point @xmath127 approaches infinity .",
    "thus we can not have arbitrarily large particle charge and still obtain a solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhoq ] the behaviour of @xmath128 and @xmath121 is displayed .",
    "recall here the definition of @xmath129 in ( [ rhoq ] ) . as can be seen",
    "the profiles of these quantities are similar .",
    "this observation applies to other cases in this paper as well which is the reason why we only focus on @xmath130    the value of @xmath126 for fixed values of @xmath131 and @xmath132 varies with @xmath96 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : q0c3 ] .     as a function of @xmath96 ]    we see that @xmath134 has an undulating quality with increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency of oscillation for larger @xmath96 . as @xmath135 , we do always have that @xmath136 .",
    "this is easily understood , since in the newtonian case the critical particle charge is exactly @xmath4 , and in the limit @xmath135 the solutions become essentially newtonian ; notice that @xmath137 is the central redshift factor ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 2.20 ) ) which is a measure for how relativistic the system is . at any point where @xmath116 equals zero , a reissner - nordstrm solution with appropriate initial values can be joined to form a steady state with finite support .",
    "the above limit for @xmath8 thus only applies to situations where the distribution function is given by a single expression on the entire domain interval @xmath138 .",
    "figure  [ fig : doublefig11 ] shows a double - peaked , single - shelled shell configuration ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the positions and magnitudes of peaks are virtually unaffected by the value of @xmath8 and the only effect that can be seen is that the tail grows in length and magnitude .",
    "the outer radius @xmath3 increases strictly monotonically . in figure",
    "[ fig : doublefig08 ] a double - peaked ball configuration with parameters ( @xmath140 ) is displayed .",
    "here we see that as @xmath8 increases , an extra maximum of @xmath116 appears . in this case",
    "@xmath3 does not increase strictly monotonically , as a decrease can be seen before the outer radius finally blows up as @xmath8 approaches @xmath126 .",
    "solutions in which a new shell appears and with strictly increasing @xmath3 can however be constructed .",
    "although barely noticable in figure  [ fig : doublefig08 ] , the radial position of the new maximum that appears for larger @xmath8 will increase at first and then decrease .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in figure  [ fig : doublefig12 ] , however .",
    "the aforemensioned case is displaying the same behavior as in figure  [ fig : doublefig08 ] , this time for a single - peaked shell configuration ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "for higher values of @xmath132 multi - shelled configurations ( i.e. , configurations with multiple peaks , separated by vacuum regions ) , can be obtained . the effect on these",
    "is that as @xmath8 increases , one or more additional shells appear as can be seen in figure  [ fig : doublefig03 ] ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "these newly appearing shells mimic the behavior of the newly appearing peak in figure  [ fig : doublefig12 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : doublefig03 ] it can be seen clearly that all peaks , except the innermost one , that are present at @xmath143 are showing an inclination to move towards @xmath71 .",
    "this behavior is also present in all cases with more than one peak , although not noticable in the plots . the innermost peak , on the other hand , has a contrary tendency to move outwards .",
    "the purpose of this section is to investigate aspects concerning sharpness of the inequality @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the total gravitational mass given by @xmath146 this inequality was derived in @xcite and it was shown to hold for any static solution of the einstein - maxwell - matter system which satisfies ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "in addition it was assumed that the solutions satisfy @xmath147 the latter conditions are imposed to ensure that the solutions are physically meaningful , cf .",
    "@xcite . to better understand the motivation for our study we recall the results in the uncharged case .",
    "if @xmath16 the inequality ( [ eq : aineq ] ) reduces to the buchdahl inequality @xmath148 which was first proved in @xcite under the buchdahl assumptions that the pressure is isotropic and the energy density is non - increasing outwards . the inequality was then shown to hold independently of the buchdahl assumptions @xcite for solutions which satisfy the energy condition @xmath149 a different proof was later given in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the latter method is that the proof is shorter and more flexible since it allows for other energy conditions than ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the disadvantage lies in the issues of sharpness and construction of the saturating solution .",
    "firstly , the method does not imply that the class of saturating solutions is unique , and secondly , it is not clear that a solution to a _ coupled _ einstein - matter system can have the properties of the saturating solution constructed in @xcite . in particular solutions to the einstein - vlasov system are ruled out .",
    "these issues have however affirmative answers .",
    "uniqueness is obtained in @xcite where it is proved that a saturating solution must be an infinitely thin shell solution . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that regular , arbitrarily thin shell solutions of the einstein - vlasov system exist , which implies that there are steady states to this system with @xmath18 arbitrarily close to @xmath19    let us now return to the charged case and discuss the latter two issues .",
    "the proof of ( [ eq : aineq ] ) in @xcite is based on the method in @xcite and the method in @xcite does not apply .",
    "a proof based on the latter method would imply uniqueness of the saturating solution , and it is thus natural to ask if there is another class than infinitely thin shell solutions with this property .",
    "also , although the result in @xcite shows that infinitely thin shell solutions saturate the inequality there is no analogous result to @xcite in the charged case , i.e. , the question whether or not the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system admits arbitrarily thin shell solutions is open . below we will present numerical evidence that the system does admit arbitrary thin shell solutions and in addition that another class of saturating solutions does exist .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath150 which in terms of the functions introduced in reads @xmath151 by , @xmath152 is subject to the inequality @xmath153 in figure  [ fig : aineq2 ] the numerical results for a shell configuration with @xmath154 are displayed as follows .",
    "@xmath152 as a function of @xmath96 is displayed in ascending order for @xmath155 the bottom - most curve being that for @xmath156 , the next to bottom - most being that for @xmath157 and so on . in all cases tested for other parameter values",

    "be the outer radius of the first shell and plotting the ratio @xmath160 in figure  [ fig : rquot ] ,     as a function of @xmath96 ]    we see that in the limit @xmath161 , @xmath162 , i.e. , we find numerical support that the einstein - vlasov - maxwell system admits arbitrarily thin shell solutions . for values of @xmath163",
    ", we see that @xmath158 is monotonically decreasing , and as @xmath96 approaches unity , @xmath152 approaches zero .",

    "slightly larger than @xmath165 @xmath152 will not increase rapidly enough for to once again be saturated . for larger values of @xmath8 , will however be saturated a second time , cf .  figure  [ fig : aineq4 ] where the graph for the case with @xmath166 is depicted using a different scale on the @xmath167axis . from figure",
    "[ fig : quot ] it is clear that this occurs when @xmath168 .",
    "hence , in the charged case the class of saturating solutions is not unique .",

    "however , it should be noted that the nonlinearity of the equations make it impossible to completely separate the influences of these quantities . in figure",
