    "the t - matrix method @xcite is commonly used to calculate properties of light scattering from axisymmetric mesoscale ( @xmath0 ) particles that are homogeneous and isotropic @xcite @xcite . using the t - matrix , the optical force and torque imparted on the particle by the incident beam can be calculated @xcite .",
    "the t - matrix is independent of the incident field and only dependent of the properties ( size , shape , orientation , permittivity ) of the particle .",
    "if the incident fields change , the t - matrix need not be recalculated .",
    "we extend this method to model particles that are inhomogenous , anisotropic and have complex geometrical shapes by combining the t - matrix method with the finite difference frequency domain ( fdfd ) method . in the fdfd method , we discretize the computational region into a grid with sufficiently small grid size . the inclusion of fdfd equations in the algorithm is computationally intensive . to optimize computational time and memory usage , we consider the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "if the particle is rotationally symmetric about an axis , the system could be reduced to a 2d problem ( figures 1a and 1b ) . by choosing a cylindrical coordinate system ,",
    "the section of interest can be treated in 2d rectangular @xmath1 coordinates which leads to compatibility with the fdfd cell ( figure 1c ) . if the particle has _ _ n__th - order discrete rotational symmetry , typical of a microrotor , savings in computational time and memory could still be achieved by performing calculations for only one repeated segment .",
    "for example , we modelling the optical trapping of a cube , exploiting the 4th order rotational symmetry and @xmath2-plane mirror symmetry , to reduce the time required to calculate the t - matrix from 30 hours to 20 minutes .",
    "a ) b ) c )    the rotationally symmetric fdfd equations were derived by expanding maxwell curl and divergence equations @xcite in cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the electric field , @xmath6 , or the magnetic field , @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of both fields can be expressed as @xmath8 .",
    "it is sufficient , as will be seen below , to consider a field with azimuthal variation @xmath9 ; the variation of the field with respect to @xmath10 would be @xmath11 . substituting the time evolution and @xmath10 harmonic equations into maxwell s equations we obtain 6 curl equations and 2 divergence equations for electric and magnetic fields .",
    "as an example , the curl equation for @xmath12 is    @xmath13    using the yee cell @xcite in figure 1c for discretization , the fdfd curl equation for @xmath12 can be written as @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the other equations can be discretised similarly .",
    "the t - matrix is an operator ( @xmath15 ) which acts on the coefficients of the incoming field to produce the coefficients of the outgoing field @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the vector made up of the coefficients ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) of the incoming field and @xmath20 represents the vector of the coefficients ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of the outgoing field . the electric fields ( and similarly for magnetic fields )",
    "can be expanded in terms of incoming and outgoing vector spherical wave functions ( vswfs ) @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wave vector outside the particle , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are vector spherical wave functions ( vswfs ) defined in @xcite .",
    "naturally , we can not take the sums to infinity but rather taken to @xmath28 which is based on criteria defined in @xcite . in our model",
    ", we would have a dielectric region within the computational grid that would interact with the incoming and outgoing fields .",
    "so , in coupling the electric field @xmath29 from the fdfd solutions with the vswfs for the te incident modes we obtain @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the incident mode .",
    "similarly for the tm modes , @xmath32 due to the rotational symmetry , there is no coupling to other azimuthal modes ( i.e. only one value of @xmath33 appears ) .",
    "therefore , all fields share an azimuthal dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "a ) and @xmath35 modes are shown as black pixels.,title=\"fig:\",height=204 ] b ) and @xmath35 modes are shown as black pixels.,title=\"fig:\",height=222 ]    equation ( 8) or ( 9 ) connects the vswf description of the external fields and the fdfd grid .",
    "the vswf and fdfd equations form an overdetermined linear system ( figure 2a ) and can be solved using a standard numerical library .",
    "the fdfd equations are inserted in the coefficient matrix ( figure 2a ) first followed by vswf equations .",
    "last , the _",
    "z_-axis boundary equations are inserted in the coefficient matrix .",
    "generally , the field is zero at the _ z_-axis except for the modes @xmath36 , in which case the first derivatives of the fields are zero .",
    "cycling through all incident modes , the solutions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 are solved given one incident mode at a time and their values are inserted into the t - matrix column representing coupling between the @xmath37 and @xmath35 modes ( figure 2b ) .",
    "the micromachines of interest may or may not have @xmath2-plane mirror symmetry but they will typically have _ _ n__th - order rotational symmetry .",
    "nonetheless , as with the cube we had modelled , the rotational symmetry can be exploited to reduce the calculation time by orders of magnitude .",
    "conventional t - matrix methods are limited in their application to modelling homogeneous and isotropic materials , with shapes that are close to spheroidal .",
    "the fdfd hybridization extends the modelling capability to include _ _",
    "n__th - order rotationally symmetric micro - machines with complex shapes made from materials that are inhomogenous and anisotropic e.g. birefringent crystals .",
    "the matlab script for solving the matrices in figure 2a was tested on a pc with a 32-bit single 3ghz cpu and 1 gb of ram .",
    "we performed the calculation simulating a 3000 nm radius cylinder with grid sizes from 1000nm250 nm . extrapolating from the natural log scale plot ( figure 3 )",
    ", we estimated that it would take 13.6 hours and 165.9 hours ( 7 days ) to perform the calculation given 100 nm and 50 nm grid spacing respectively .",
    "while the foregoing is directed at modelling rotational symmetric particles , we intend to model more complex particles buy using a 3d fdfd grid or the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) method @xcite coupling with the vswfs ."
