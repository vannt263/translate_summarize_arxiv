    "the physics of quantum dots  the small man - made structures in a semiconductor containing anything from a few to thousands or more electrons  has already enjoyed a busy and fruitful decade as a major field of research in condensed matter physics.@xcite a large part of the experimental work on quantum dots focused on the probing of the electronic states inside the dots by means of far - infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy.@xcite however , a very common feature of many quantum structures is their nearly circular shape and a parabolic confining potential@xcite which has profound consequences on the optical response . according to the generalized kohn theorem,@xcite under such conditions the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion decouples from the relative motion of the electrons , and the electric field of the fir radiation couples only to the former .",
    "consequently , the absorption spectra of circular parabolic quantum dots consist only of two cm peaks whose positions are independent of the electron number and insensitive to the electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "actual experiments performed on arrays of quantum dots containing a few@xcite or up to a few hundred electrons@xcite have confirmed the basic two - peak structure in the absorption ( transmission ) spectra .",
    "small deviations were explained by taking into account the nonparabolicity effects,@xcite lateral coulomb coupling between the neighboring dots,@xcite and spin - orbit interaction.@xcite in a separate line of development , experimentalists performed a fir spectroscopy study@xcite of the formation of incompressible edge stripes@xcite in quantum dots and antidots with a deliberately tailored hard - wall confinement , thereby demonstrating that fir spectroscopy is capable of giving a detailed insight into many - body systems . as a matter of fact , in this work in order to increase the signal strength and create non - parabolic potential profiles , double - layer dots with three doping layers were used .",
    "therefore , besides the dominant `` optical '' modes where the electrons in both layers oscillate in phase , also somewhat weaker `` acoustic '' modes were visible .",
    "recently , the system of two vertically coupled quantum dots was also studied theoretically in greater detail.@xcite this setup is interesting because even in the case when the confining potentials of the individual dots are parabolic , the kohn theorem is broken by the interaction between the non - equivalent dots .",
    "therefore , besides the usual cm modes a rather rich spectrum of collective modes can be excited , however , most of the oscillator strength is still contained in the center - of - mass modes .    in the present paper",
    "we study a similar system consisting of two vertically coupled circular parabolic quantum dots containing carriers of opposite charge sign , electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "our results are very different from those pertaining to the previously studied@xcite vertically coupled dot system and reveal an interesting anticrossing of cm - derived modes belonging to separate dots marked by a major oscillator strength transfer between them .",
    "the kind of system we have in mind can be structured in bilayer - bipolar heterostructures containing parallel electron and hole layers _ in equilibrium_. these structures have been realized in the crossed gap inas / gasb system @xcite as well as in biased gaas / algaas heterostructure @xcite where electron and hole layers form on the opposite sides of an algaas barrier .",
    "most of the interest in such systems stems from the possibility ( at least , in principle ) of the formation of bose - einstein condensate of indirect excitons @xcite . while the formation of the superfluid state has not been demonstrated so far , a number of other interesting effects due to the electron - hole coupling have been predicted and/or observed.@xcite    our computational approach is based on the generalization to bilayer two - component systems of the formalism developed by zaremba and his co - workers@xcite and successfully applied to a number of electronic systems.@xcite this approach is well suited to describe quantum dots with a large number of electrons whose dynamic response is dominated by collective excitations.@xcite our paper has the following structure . in section [ sec_theory ]",

    "this model predicts that the gap grows proportionally to @xmath106 , however , this law is valid only at relatively large distances @xmath107 .",
    "we found that for smaller values of @xmath36 the splitting could be reasonably well fitted by the dependence @xmath108 indicated by a dashed line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_cmw ] .    the evolution of the respective oscillator strengths in fig .",
    "[ fig_cmf ] is rather peculiar and requires a more detailed explanation .",
    "the sum of the oscillator strengths satisfies a sum rule , are we normalise it so that their total sum equals @xmath109 . in the present example the electron and hole numbers are set equal while the holes are taken to be @xmath12 times heavier than the electrons . therefore , since the oscillator strengths scale as @xmath110 , the electronic modes possess @xmath111 times higher oscillator strengths .",

    ", one observes a rather pronounced depression in the oscillator strength of the lower branch reaching nearly zero value .",
    "the missing oscillator strength is transferred to the high - frequency branch .",
    "this type of behaviour can be understood by realising that at the anticrossing point the charge density oscillations of the individual dots combine together in either `` optical '' ( the two electric dipoles being aligned in parallel ) or `` acoustic '' ( antiparallel dipoles ) fashion , as illustrated in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig_intro ] . naturally , the parallel alignment of two dipoles costs more energy , and therefore this `` optical '' mode has a higher oscillation frequency , while at the same time it possesses a larger net dipole moment , and consequently , a higher oscillator strength . as one notes in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_cmf ] , the same type of qualitative behaviour is also observed in the coupled harmonic - oscillator model of appendix [ app_model ] .",
    "however , as far as oscillator strengths are concerned , its quantitative predictions are not trustworthy , and thus one can only rely on the more - accurate numerical treatment .",
    "our calculations predict the above described oscillations of the oscillator strengths to be quite strong . in fig .",
    "[ fig_peaks ] we show a set of absorption lines simulating those obtainable in fir spectroscopy measurements@xcite which have been calculated for the case of a vertical separation between the dots @xmath102 .",
    "we plot nine lines corresponding to nine equally spaced values of the magnetic fields between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( the anticrossing region ) thus making the `` disappearance '' of the low - frequency branch apparent .",
    "since the fluctuations of the oscillator strengths of these modes can be rather large ( of order of @xmath118 of the total oscillator strength ) we expect that the above described effect could be readily observed experimentally .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while in the above examples we always dealt with equal numbers of electrons and holes in the dots , the ratio of the electron and hole numbers can be useful to balance the distribution of oscillator strengths between the modes .",
    "for example , increasing the number of holes will brighten the modes that are mostly due to oscillations in the hole subsystem thereby compensating for their diminished oscillator strengths because of higher hole effective mass . as we show in appendix [ app_model ] , the strength of the interaction between the two dots and the anticrossing gap scale as the geometric mean of the electron and hole numbers .        besides the above described strong modes the spectra of artificial molecules feature a number of other rather weak modes that can be classified into higher resonances and low - energy edge modes .",
    "due to a stronger localisation of the charge - density oscillations associated with these modes , the number of terms in the expansions ( [ eq_basis ] ) has to be increased for an accurate representation .",
    "the oscillator strengths of these modes , under the conditions of our calculations , typically barely reach @xmath119 of the total sum of the oscillator strengths . in fig .",
    "[ fig_hilo ] , we show the magnetic field dispersions of the lowest lying high - energy modes and several strongest edge modes .",
    "these results are obtained for the parameter values @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath120 , @xmath32 , and @xmath121 .",
    "the full ( dashed ) lines denote branches polarised in the positive ( negative ) direction . in general , the locations and dispersions of these modes resemble analogous modes as predicted for coupled quantum dots populated solely by electrons.@xcite the key difference is that in the present case one can classify the modes into those dominated by oscillations in either the electron or hole subsystems .",
    "thus , the two lower high - energy resonances in fig .  [ fig_hilo ] are mostly due to holes while the topmost mode is mainly electronic .",
    "the difference can be most easily spotted in the relative arrangement of the positively and negatively polarised branches at finite magnetic fields . in the electronic mode ,",
    "the upper branch is polarised in the positive ( i.  e.  electronic cyclotron resonance ) direction , while in the case of the other two high - energy modes the situation is reversed .",
    "moreover , the electronic mode features a considerably stronger magnetic - field dispersion .",
    "this is due to the fact that the higher resonances asymptotically approach the cyclotron - resonance line which is @xmath12 times steeper for electrons than for holes .    the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig_hilo ] shows six most conspicuous edge modes of the bipolar quantum - dot molecule .",
    "the frequency range covered by these modes and their dispersion again resemble the case of electronic coupled dots.@xcite however , due to the fact that the polarisations of the edge modes are determined by the charge - sign of the carriers , in the present case the edge modes can be polarised both in the cyclotron and the anticyclotron directions .",
    "moreover , the direction of polarisation of an edge mode also betrays the component whose contribution is dominant .",
    "thus , the edge modes mostly influenced by the electronic subsystem are polarized in the `` @xmath101 '' , i.e.  _ anticyclotron _ direction of the electrons .",
    "these modes a depicted by the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig_hilo ] .",
    "contrariwise , the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_hilo ] denote the modes mostly due to the oscillations in the hole subsystem which are polarised in the `` @xmath100 '' , i.  e.  electronic cyclotron resonance direction .",
    "in conclusion , we made a theoretical investigation of the equilibrium density distributions and the far - infrared response of bipolar quantum - dot molecules within a hydrodynamic model including the effects due to exchange and kinetic - energy in the von weizscker approximation .",
    "the most conspicuous effect we found is the pronounced anticrossing between two modified center - of - mass modes which takes place when the applied magnetic field aligns the frequencies of two centre - of - mass modes .",
    "the additional distinguishing feature of this anticrossing is the strongly non - monotonous behaviour of the oscillator strengths of the two resulting branches .",
    "the oscillator strength transfer from the lower `` acoustic '' to the higher `` optical '' branch is certainly strong enough to be easily observable . on the other hand , the higher resonances and edge modes which are also excited in the considered setup are quite weak .",

    "in this problem we encountered two types of coulomb integrals @xmath122 here , @xmath123 depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath124 while @xmath125 has a @xmath79-wave angular dependence .",
    "@xmath36 is the vertical separation between the layers which as a special case may equal zero .",
    "the angular integration in of eq .  ( [ eq_jsp ] ) can be carried out analytically in terms of the complete elliptic functions of the first kind @xmath126 , and the second kind @xmath127 . introducing @xmath128 we obtain @xmath129 with @xmath130 - k(k).\\ ] ]",
    "guided by a similar simple model introduced in ref .  , we show that a number of basic features of the cm - mode spectrum can be derived ( at least qualitatively ) from a simplified model featuring two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the oscillators concentrate the total masses and charges of the two coupled dots and interact via the potential @xmath131 here @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the oscillator coordinates , and we used the fact that in our units @xmath134 . denoting the base frequencies of the oscillators by @xmath37 and @xmath38 we write down the coupled equations of motion ( @xmath135 )      eqs .",
    "( [ eq_b2 ] ) are solved by introducing the complex variables @xmath137 and assuming a harmonic temporal dependence @xmath138 .",
    "this leads to the following secular equation for the resonance frequencies @xmath139    here we denoted @xmath140 and @xmath141 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_b3 ] ) the cm - mode frequencies can be readily obtained as solutions of a quartic equation .",
    "however , basing on the smallness of the coupling parameter @xmath142 , it is possible to extract some simpler approximate expressions .",
    "we begin by noting that the role of the terms proportional to @xmath142 entering the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq_b3 ] ) is diffierent .",
    "the former give first - order corrections to the frequency dispersion , while the latter contribute to the second order and are important only close to coinciding frequencies , thus defining an anticrossing .",
    "therefore , we first neglect the off - diagonal perturbations and solve two decoupled quadratic equations originating from the diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq_b3 ] ) .",
    "the solutions read @xmath143 the modes of positive frequencies @xmath144 and @xmath145 obtained using the upper signs in eq .",
    "( [ eq_b4 ] ) are of `` @xmath100 '' circular polarisation while the lower - sign solutions @xmath146 and @xmath147 are negative and correspond to modes polarised in the `` @xmath101 '' direction .",
    "we note , that eq .",
    "( [ eq_b4 ] ) predicts that the absolute values of all four resonance frequencies _ increase _ due to the inter - dot coupling and gives an estimate of the shifts . in the weak coupling regime",
    "they grow as @xmath148 .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with our results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro ] ) and underscores a difference of our system from electronic double dots considered in ref .  .",
    "there , all frequency shifts found were negative .    assuming that ( as in our numerical calculations ) @xmath149 we find that the modes polarised in `` @xmath101 '' direction will cross .",
    "the crossing point is readily calculated by equating @xmath150 and equals @xmath151 note , that we present the zero - order solution obtained by setting @xmath152 which provides an accurate enough estimate .",
    "close to this point the off - diagonal perturbations are important and have to be taken into account to introduce an anticrossing behaviour .",
    "we use the fact that in the vicinity of the resonances of `` @xmath101 '' polarisation ( roots @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) the diagonal terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq_b3 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath155 and obtain a quadratic equation @xmath156 valid in this region and giving an approximate behaviour of the anticrossing modes .",
    "this equation can be used , in particular , to estimate the size of the anticrossing gap . to this end",
    "we calculate the difference of its two roots at @xmath157 and @xmath150 , and obtain @xmath158 with @xmath159 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_b4 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq_b4 ] )  ( [ eq_b6 ] ) are useful as quick estimates of essential features ( mode shifts , position and size of anticrossing gap ) in the cm - mode spectrum of bipolar quantum dot molecules .",
    "these estimates are obtained for weakly coupled dots and can be asked for quantitave predictions only in the limit when inter - dot separation considerably exceeds the dot radii .",
    "thus , the gap size obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq_b6 ] ) agrees with the result of accurate numerical calculations within @xmath118 at @xmath121 .",
