    "x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) often show evidence for deep ( 739  ev ) and ( 871  ev ) absorption edges .",
    "the ionized gas component creating these edges is named the ` warm absorber ' and is seen in most ( @xmath470% ) seyfert  1s and some quasars .",
    "theoretical models for the warm absorber suggest it should also be a source of x - ray emission ( e.g. , netzer 1996 ) and absorption ( e.g. , nicastro , fiore , & matt 1999 ) lines . while the current x - ray data are consistent with the presence of such lines ( e.g. , george et  al 1998a ) , it has been impossible to study them in any detail .    the bright seyfert  1 galaxy ngc3783 ( @xmath5 mag , @xmath6 ) has one of the strongest x - ray warm absorbers known with a column density of ionized gas of @xmath7  ( 12)@xmath8  @xmath3 .",
    "_ asca _ spectra also show warm absorber variability and excess flux around 600  ev which has been interpreted as emission lines from the warm absorber , particularly  568  ev ( e.g. , george et  al .",
    "1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "uv spectra of ngc3783 show intrinsic absorption features due to , and .",
    "two kinematic absorption components are known with radial velocities of @xmath9  kms@xmath1 and @xmath10  kms@xmath1 relative to the optical redshift from [ ] .",
    "the absorption shows extreme variability ( e.g. , crenshaw et  al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the uv and x - ray absorbing gas are the same , although some relation seems likely ( e.g. , shields & hamann 1997 ) .",
    "this letter describes the discovery of a large number of x - ray absorption lines in the _ chandra _ spectrum of ngc 3783 . in   2 we describe the observation and data analysis , and   3 gives the preliminary interpretation of the results .",
    "ngc3783 was observed using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; c. r. canizares et al . , in preparation ) on the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory on 2000 january 21 .",
    "the detector was the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; g. p. garmire et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the total integration time was 56  ks , and the observation was continuous .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard pipeline by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) on 2000 january 26 .",
    "we used the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software to repeat the reduction process using an updated response matrix file .",
    "our reduction produced somewhat less noisy spectra than those produced by the pipeline .",
    "the hetgs produces a zeroth order x - ray spectrum at the aim point on the ccd and higher order spectra which have much higher spectral resolution along the acis - s array .",
    "the higher order spectra are from two grating assemblies , the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "each grating assembly produces two spectra for each order .",
    "order overlaps are discriminated by the intrinsic energy resolution of acis .",
    "the zeroth - order spectrum of ngc  3783 shows substantial photon pile up , and we leave the detailed analysis of these data to a future paper .",
    "we briefly comment , however , on the presence of a weak ( @xmath11 photon ) off - nuclear ( @xmath12 ) source located at @xmath13  11@xmath1439@xmath1501@xmath161 , @xmath17  @xmath1844@xmath1952@xmath209 , coincident with one of the galaxy s spiral arms .",
    "this source may be a luminous ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ergss@xmath1 ) x - ray binary in ngc  3783 , although it could also be an unrelated background source .",
    "= 18.5 cm    the first - order spectra from the heg and meg have s / n ratios of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( at around 7   ) .",
    "the higher order spectra had only a few ( @xmath25 ) photons per bin and will not be presented here . in order to flux calibrate the spectra we used the ciao software to produce ancillary response files ( arfs ) .",
    "the flux calibration error is estimated to be @xmath2610% below 6  and @xmath2620% above 6    ( cxc , private communication ) .",
    "we also corrected the spectra for the galactic absorption of @xmath27  @xmath3 and the cosmological redshift .",
    "the two meg first - order spectra agree well with each other .",
    "the dispersions of the meg spectra are 0.005    per bin , and the spectral resolution is @xmath28    ( approximately constant across the entire hetgs band ) .",
    "the two heg spectra also agree well with each other and with the meg spectra , though they have lower s / n .",
    "the heg spectra have dispersions of 0.0025    per bin , and the spectral resolution is about two times better than for the meg spectra . in fig .",
    "[ megspec ] we present the mean of the two meg spectra .",
    "this mean spectrum was smoothed using a simple 3-bin boxcar filter . since above",
    "@xmath2916    there are @xmath264 counts per 0.005    bin , the spectrum presented in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ megspec ] is binned to 0.02   .",
    "the overall shape and flux of the x - ray spectrum are consistent with those found in previous x - ray observations of ngc3783 ( e.g. , george et  al .",
    "fluxes in several energy bands are also consistent with those from a simultaneous 4  ks _ asca _ spectrum to within @xmath30  10% .",
    "the total flux measured from the _ chandra _ spectrum is ( 2.0@xmath310.2)@xmath3210@xmath33  ergs@xmath3s@xmath1 in the 0.52  kev band and ( 4.2@xmath310.9)@xmath3210@xmath33  ergs@xmath3s@xmath1 in the 27  kev band .",
    "when plotting the modeled _ asca _ spectrum on top of the _ chandra _ spectrum , we find general consistency in the overall shape as well as with the oxygen absorption edges .",
    "the most striking new features seen in the _ chandra _ spectrum of ngc3783 are narrow x - ray absorption lines . in order to measure these spectral features we interpolated over all the absorption lines and fitted the resulting continuum with a cubic spline which serves as the continuum reference point for measuring the lines . in table  1",
    "we list the information about selected absorption and emission lines . in fig .",
    "[ megspec ] we identify some absorption lines which are not listed in table  1 due to brevity and lack of model predictions .",
    "there are also some absorption and emission features which appear to be present but are not identified yet .",
    "we used multiple lines from the same ion to help with line identification .",
    "we checked for the existence of these lines in each of the meg spectra ( and also in the heg spectra when possible ) and measured them in the smoothed average spectrum .",
    "the measured lines full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) are consistent with the meg resolution which is @xmath34  kms@xmath1 at 5    and @xmath35  kms@xmath1 at 15   .",
    "hence , the lines are not clearly resolved ( see discussion in   [ dinamic ] ) .",
    "we were not able to put better constraints on the velocity field with the heg due to the small s / n .",
    "the strongest observed absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 are from the h - like and he - like ions of o , ne , mg , si , s and ar , as well as  l - shell lines ( see table  1 but note that some features represent blends , and the values given are the summed ews ) .",
    "as explained above , the lines are not resolved , and the only firm conclusion is that , given a gaussian profile , their fwhms do not exceed a few hundred kms@xmath1 . given this uncertainty ,",
    "we have taken an approach that relies solely on the measured ews of the lines .",

    "the standard ( @xmath42  ev ) ionization parameter for this continuum is 19.3 and the mean temperature is 1.9@xmath43  k. we have assumed doppler profiles with @xmath44 and calculated absorption ews for @xmath45  kms@xmath1 .",

    "we have carried out basic tests to verify that the deduced line widths are in the right range .",

    "all the identified absorption lines in the hetg spectrum of ngc3783 are blueshifted by a few hundred  kms@xmath1 with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the unweighted mean blueshift is 440@xmath31200  kms@xmath1 .",
    "kaastra et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently observed the bright seyfert  1 ngc5548 using the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) on _ chandra_. the low - energy x - ray lines reported in that paper indicate a similar level of ionization , and the absorption lines are blueshifted by similar amounts . judging by these first two results",
    ", it seems that the warm x - ray material in seyfert  1 galaxies is outflowing with typical velocities of several hundred kms@xmath1 .",
    "this has important implications for the dynamics of the absorbing gas as well as for the x - ray - uv connection .",
    "the acceleration of x - ray ionized gas by the strong central radiation source in agn has not been studied in detail so far ( for some discussion see reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .",
    "the recent work by chelouche & netzer ( 2000 ) is the first detailed study of this kind .",
    "this study discusses the motion of discrete , x - ray ionized clouds in hydrostatic equilibrium , under a large range of conditions .",
    "it shows that acceleration to velocities of a few hundred to a few thousand kms@xmath1 is a natural consequence of the agn environment .",
    "the terminal velocity is of the same order as the escape velocity in the region where the flow originates . using these results , and assuming that the conditions in the nucleus of ngc3783 are similar to those considered by chelouche & netzer ( 2000 ) , we conclude that the origin of the warm absorbing gas in this source is outside the broad line region , where the escape velocity drops below @xmath49  kms@xmath1 .",
    "better line profile analysis will enable us to constrain this location more accurately .",
    "another important comparison is with the uv absorption lines observed from this source .",
    "several papers ( e.g. , mathur , elvis , & wilkes 1995 ; shields & hamann 1997 and references therein ) suggest that the uv and x - ray absorbers may originate in the same component .",
    "the crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) observations reveal two uv absorption systems , the strongest of which has a velocity consistent with the mean observed velocity of the x - ray gas and a velocity dispersion consistent with our best fitted model . our model , which depends on the assumed sed , predicts column densities for and ( see table  2 ) which are 37 and 5 times smaller , respectively , than what has been calculated by crenshaw et al . ( 1999 ) using the 19931995 data .",
    "hence the uv absorption lines appear to be inconsistent with our x - ray absorber model and are likely coming from a separate component .",
    "the hetg spectra of ngc3783 revel several weak emission lines ( see table  1 ) some of which show hints of p cygni profiles .",
    "these have a marginally significant redshift with an unweighted mean of 230@xmath31170  kms@xmath1 relative to the systemic velocity measured from the [ ] line .",
    "kaastra et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) found similar redshifts for the emission lines in the letg spectrum of ngc5548 . while the ews of some of the lines are well within the meg and heg capability , the low s / n and bumpy continuum do not allow reliable ew measurements .",
    "the values given in table  1 are therefore highly uncertain . however , even these rough measurements are good enough to test the idea that the central source in ngc3783 is surrounded by gas clouds with properties similar to those deduced for the line - of - sight absorber .",
    "this is done by comparing the ews calculated by ion with those observed , for various assumed covering factors .",
    "the calculated emission - line ews , for an assumed geometry of full covering , are listed in table  1 .",
    "given these values , we find that the mean deduced covering factor is close to unity , in agreement with previous estimates ( e.g. , george et al . 1998b ) .",
    "this is the _ first direct constraint _ on the covering factor of a warm absorber in any agn .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty on the covering factor is large , due to the uncertain ews .",
