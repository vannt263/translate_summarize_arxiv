    "in a canonical ensemble molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , configurations are sampled with the probability @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the configuration of a molecular system with @xmath2 number of atoms , @xmath3 with boltzmann constant @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the potential energy , and @xmath7 is the configurational partition function . let the order parameter be @xmath8 , then the probability along @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 the helmholtz free energy along @xmath9 can then be computed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some constant .",
    "@xmath13 could be directly obtained from the probability distribution of @xmath9 computed from a canonical ensemble md simulation , provided a proper sampling of @xmath9 is achieved .",
    "@xcite    often it is more convenient to assume that @xmath9 is a linear combination of a few collective variables @xmath14 . in practice ,",
    "probability distribution @xmath15 for the set of selected collective variables is constructed as , @xmath16 thus @xmath17 and the minimum energy pathway can be traced on the multi - dimensional surface @xmath18 .",
    "this assumes that we have the knowledge of @xmath19 for describing the process of our interest .",
    "the current work presumes that the set of collective variables @xmath20 to describe and to sample the distribution is known , however , the number of collective variables is large . although , the number of coordinates to describe a process is often small in number,@xcite several other orthogonal coordinates have to be enhanced - sampled for a quick convergence in probability distribution along the reactive coordinates and thus the free energy estimates .",
    "timescale at which a barrier crossing event takes place on a potential energy landscape during a canonical ensemble simulation is @xmath21 .",
    "due to the limitation of small time steps in md simulations , the simulation time to observe such processes becomes very large and computationally unfeasible for many interesting processes with free energy barrier @xmath22 .",
    "one of the ways in which this timescale bottleneck can be overcome is by modifying the boltzmann weight through altering @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bias potential .",
    "metadynamics@xcite ( mtd ) and umbrella sampling ( us )  @xcite are two such popular biased sampling methods , among several others  @xcite .    in mtd , a time dependent bias potential , @xmath26 ,",

    "free energy estimate can be obtained as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath12 is some constant .",
    "the main advantage of mtd is that it is capable of sampling the @xmath19 space in a self  guided manner , and thus the method can explore unprecedented minima and reaction pathways on high  dimensional free energy landscapes.@xcite nowadays , mtd is used in exploring free energy landscapes up to three collective variables . the total computational time required to explore the free energy landscape depends exponentially on the number of collective variables . in order to increase the efficiency of sampling large number of coordinates , parallel tempering mtd  @xcite , bias ",

    "the distribution of @xmath19 from @xmath38 windows are reweighted and stitched together by the weighted histogram analysis ( wham ) method.@xcite the sampling of the collective variables are determined by the span of the windows , and thus us allows to achieve a controlled sampling of collective variable space .",
    "like in mtd , the computational cost increases with the number of dimensions and most of the applications using this technique have been limited to one or two collective variables only .    another way to accelerate the sampling of collective variables",
    "is by modifying the boltzmann factor using @xmath39 , where @xmath40 corresponds to the temperature @xmath41 , which is much greater than the system temperature @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite it may be noted that in their `` heating and flooding '' approach , both temperature acceleration and the bias potentials are applied simultaneously to all the collective variables .",
    "we have recently introduced a method called well  sliced mtd ( ws  mtd )  @xcite to overcome the limitation of metadynamics in sampling broad and unbound free energy basins which are encountered often in the case of a+b type of chemical reactions , drug binding , protein folding etc . in this technique",

    "the efficiency is improved by introducing temperature acceleration of collective variables in the spirit of tamd .",
    "the method could be considered as an improvement to mtd and tamd approaches to sample broad and unbound surfaces in an efficient manner .",
    "furthermore , this method may also be looked at as an extension to the us for incorporating large number of orthogonal coordinates . at first",
    ", we will discuss the theory behind the tass approach , and then demonstrate its efficiency for the following four problems : ( a ) exploring a three dimensional potential model ; ( b ) computing the free energy landscape in the space of four backbone torsions for alanine tripeptide _ in vacuo _ using the amber force  field ; ( c ) modeling cyclization reaction of butadiene using _ ab initio _ car  parrinello md by sampling three collective variables ; ( d ) computing the free energy barrier for the hydrolysis reaction of an enzyme  drug complex by sampling four collective variables in a density functional theory ( dft ) based qm / mm md simulation .",

    "the hydrogen bonding interaction between lys@xmath164 and tyr@xmath169 was broken in the initial stages of the chemical reaction , as a result of which , another water molecule ( w2 ) moved into the active site , and lys@xmath164 formed interactions with glu@xmath193 .    the free energy barrier for the reaction was computed from the projected free energy surface on @xmath163 $ ] and @xmath157 $ ] coordinates , and is 24.5  kcal  mol@xmath90 . from experimental studies  @xcite it is known that aztreonam is a slowly hydrolyzing drug and from the measured rate constants for deacylation , we estimate the corresponding free energy barrier as 23  kcal  mol@xmath90 ( using the transition state theory ) .",
    "this agrees well with our computed free energy barrier of 24.5  kcal  mol@xmath90 .",
    "the same reaction was failed to simulate in an ordinary mtd run , likely due to the broad nature of the basin along the @xmath163 $ ] coordinate ( see also figure  [ cbl_reaction])c , and thus large computational time would be required to build the sufficient bias potential in the relevant parts of the free energy surface . moreover ,",
    "w@xmath135 water molecule was also driven out of the active site , which was then replaced by an mm water molecule from the bulk ( data not shown ) .",
    "both these difficulties are overcome in the tass simulation since us was carried out along the @xmath163 $ ] coordinate .",
    "additionally , sampling of different conformations of the active site residues needed four collective variables which is also practically difficult to sample properly with conventional mtd , especially in dft based qm / mm simulations .",
    "in this paper , we presented a method called tass that combines mtd , us , and tamd to sample large number of collective variables and explore high dimensional free energy landscapes .",
    "free energy estimates using tass is shown to converge systematically to the exact values .",
    "we have demonstrated the efficiency of tass in sampling four and five dimensional free energy landscapes with multiple minima along different coordinates .",
    "moreover , the method is also shown to be practically usable for computing free energy surfaces of chemical reactions in _ ab initio _ and dft based hybrid qm / mm md simulations .",
    "the method is well suited for exploring free energy surfaces that are broad and unbound , where conventional enhanced sampling approaches such as mtd and tamd become inefficient .",
    "controlled exploration of free energy surfaces , for e.g. along certain reaction pathways , can also be achieved in tass , by an appropriate choice of the us coordinate .",
    "the method permits one to add and remove collective variables in different umbrella windows , giving flexibility and computational efficiency in exploring complex high dimensional free energy landscapes .",
    "although , we have used us and mtd biases , the method can be straightforwardly extended to the cases where mtd bias is not required ( either in selected or for all the umbrella windows ) , by setting @xmath194 in equation  .",
    "replica exchange based algorithms can also be combined with tass to further improve the sampling efficiency .",
    "the tass hamiltonian in equation   can be realized effortlessly in simulations using md plugins like plumed  @xcite which has been interfaced with several popular mm and qm programs .",
