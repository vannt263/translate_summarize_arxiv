    "members of your organization are located throughout a crowded conference hall .",
    "you know a rumor that you want to spread to all the members of your organization , but you do not want anyone else in the hall to learn it . to maintain discreetness , communication occurs only through whispered one - on - one conversations held between pairs of nearby members of your organization . in more detail ,",
    "time proceeds in rounds . in each round , each member of your organization can attempt to initiate a whispered conversation with a single nearby member in the conference hall . to avoid drawing attention , each member can only whisper to one person per round . in this paper , we study how quickly simple random strategies will propagate your rumor in this imagined crowded conference hall scenario .    [ [ the - classical - telephone - model . ] ] the classical telephone model .",

    ", an edge @xmath3 indicates that node @xmath4 can communicate directly with node @xmath5 .",
    "time proceeds in rounds . in each round",
    ", each node can initiate a _ connection _",
    "( e.g. , place a telephone call ) with a neighbor in @xmath6 through which the two nodes can then communicate .",
    "there exists an extensive literature on the performance of a random rumor spreading strategy called push - pull in the telephone model under different graph assumptions ; e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the push - pull algorithm works as follows : _ in each round , each node connects to a neighbor selected with uniform randomness ; if exactly one node in the connection is _ informed _",
    "( knows the rumor ) and one node is _ uninformed _ ( does not know the rumor ) , then the rumor is spread from the informed to the uninformed node .",
    "_ an interesting series of papers culminating only recently established that push - pull terminates ( with high probability ) in @xmath7 rounds in graphs with vertex expansion @xmath8  @xcite , and in @xmath9 rounds in graphs with graph conductance @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "( see section  [ sec : prelim ] for definitions of @xmath8 and @xmath10 . )",
    "it might be tempting to use these bounds to describe the performance of the push - pull strategy in our above conference hall scenario_but they do not apply_. a well - known quirk of the telephone model is that a given node can accept an unbounded number of incoming connections in a single round .",
    "for example , if a node @xmath4 has @xmath11 neighbors initiate a connection in a given round , in the classical telephone model @xmath4 is allowed to accept all @xmath11 connections and communicate with all @xmath11 neighbors in that round . in our conference hall scenario , by contrast , we enforce the natural assumption that each node can participate in at most one connection per round .",
    "( to share the rumor to multiple neighbors at once might attract unwanted attention . ) the existing analyses of push - pull in the telephone model , which depend on the ability of nodes to accept multiple incoming connections , do not carry over to this bounded connection setting .",
    "[ [ the - mobile - telephone - model . ] ] the mobile telephone model .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper , we formalize our conference hall scenario with a variant of the telephone model we call the _ mobile telephone model . _ our new model differs from the classical version in that it now limits each node to participate in at most one connection per round .",
    "we also introduce two new parameterized properties .",
    "the first is _ stability _ , which is described with an integer @xmath12 . for a given @xmath13 ,",
    "the network topology must remain stable for intervals of at least @xmath13 rounds before changing .",
    "the second property is _ tag length _ , which is described with an integer @xmath14 .",
    "for a given @xmath15 , at the beginning of each round , each node is allowed to publish an _ advertisement _ containing @xmath15 bits that is visible to its neighbors .",
    "notice , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the mobile telephone model exactly describes the conference hall scenario that opened this paper .    our true motivation for introducing this model , of course , is not just to facilitate covert cavorting at conferences .",
    "we believe it fits many emerging peer - to - peer communication technologies better than the classical telephone model .",
    "in particular , in the massively important space of mobile wireless devices ( e.g. , smartphones , tablets , networked vehicles , sensors ) , standards such as bluetooth le , wifi direct , and the apple multipeer connectivity framework , all depend on a _ scan - and - connect _ architecture in which devices scan for nearby devices before attempting to initiate a reliable unicast connection with a single neighbor",
    ". this architecture does not support a given device concurrently connecting with many nearby devices .",
    "furthermore , this scanning behavior enables the possibility of devices adding a small number of advertisement bits to their publicly visible identifiers ( as we capture with our tag length parameter ) , and mobility is fundamental ( as we capture with our graph stability parameter ) .",
    "[ [ results . ] ] results .",
    "+ + + + + + + +    in this paper , we study rumor spreading in the mobile telephone model under different assumptions regarding the connectivity properties of the graph as well as the values of model parameters @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "all upper bound results described below hold with high probability in the network size @xmath18 .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : prop ] , by studying whether @xmath8 and @xmath10 still provide useful upper bounds on the efficiency of rumor spreading once we move from the classical to mobile telephone model .",
    "we first prove that offline optimal rumor spreading terminates in @xmath19 rounds in the mobile telephone model in any graph with vertex expansion @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that it is _ possible _ , from a graph theory perspective , for a simple distributed rumor spreading algorithm in the mobile telephone model to match the performance of push - pull in the classical telephone model .",
    "( the question of whether simple strategies _ do _ match this optimal bound is explored later in the paper . ) at the core of this analysis are two ideas : ( 1 ) the size of a maximum matching bridging a set of informed and uninformed nodes at a given round describes the maximum number of new nodes that can be informed in that round ; and ( 2 ) we can , crucially , bound the size of these matchings with respect to the vertex expansion of the graph .",
    "we later leverage both ideas in our upper bound analysis .",
    "we then consider graph conductance and uncover a negative answer .",
    "in particular , we prove that offline optimal rumor spreading terminates in @xmath20 rounds in graphs with conductance @xmath10 , maximum degree @xmath21 , and minimum degree @xmath22 .",
    "we also prove that there exist graphs where @xmath23 rounds are required .",
    "these results stand in contrast to the potentially much smaller upper bound of @xmath24 for push - pull in the classical telephone model .",
    "in other words , once we shift from the classical to mobile telephone model , conductance no longer provides a useful upper bound on rumor spreading time .    in section  [ sec : b0 ]",
    ", we turn our attention to studying the behavior of the push - pull algorithm in the mobile telephone model with @xmath17 and @xmath25 . , there are several natural modifications we must make to push - pull for it to operate as intended under the new assumptions of the mobile telephone model . ]",
    "our goal is to determine whether this standard strategy approaches the optimal bounds from section  [ sec : prop ] . for the case of vertex expansion",
    ", we provide a negative answer by constructing a graph with constant vertex expansion @xmath8 in which push - pull requires @xmath26 rounds to terminate .",
    "whether there exists _ any _ distributed rumor spreading algorithm that can approach optimal bounds with respect to vertex expansion under these assumptions , however , remains an intriguing open question .",
    "for the case of graph conductance , we note that a consequence of a result from  @xcite is that push - pull in this setting comes within a @xmath27 factor of the ( slow ) @xmath20 optimal bound proved in section  [ sec : prop ] .",
    "in other words , in the mobile telephone model rumor spreading might be slow with respect to a graph s conductance , but push - pull matches this slow spreading time .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : b1 ] , we study push - pull in the mobile telephone model with @xmath28 . in more detail , we study the natural variant of push - pull in this setting in which nodes use their @xmath29-bit tag to advertise at the beginning of each round whether or not they are informed .",
    "we assume that informed nodes select a neighbor in each round uniformly from the set of their uninformed neighbors ( if any ) .",
    "we call this variant _ productive push _ ( ppush ) as nodes only attempt to push the rumor toward nodes that still need the rumor",
    ".    notice , in the classical telephone model , the ability to advertise your informed status trivializes rumor spreading as it allows nodes to implement a basic flood ( uninformed nodes pull only from informed neighbors)which is clearly optimal . in the mobile telephone model , by contrast ,",
    "the power of @xmath28 is not obvious : a given informed node can only communicate with ( at most ) a single uninformed neighbor per round , and it can not tell in advance which such neighbor might be most useful to inform .    our primary result in this section , which provides the primary upper bound contribution of this paper , is the following : in the mobile telephone model with @xmath28 and stability parameter @xmath30 , ppush terminates in @xmath31 rounds , where @xmath32 . in other words , for @xmath33",
    ", ppush terminates in @xmath34 rounds , matching ( within log factors ) the performance of the optimal algorithm in the mobile telephone model _ and _ the performance of push - pull in the classical telephone model .",
    "an interesting implication of this result is that the power gained by allowing nodes to advertise whether or not they know the rumor outweighs the power lost by limiting nodes to a single connection per round .    as the stability of the graph decreases from @xmath35 toward @xmath36 , the performance of ppush is degraded by a factor of @xmath37 . at the core of this result",
    "is a novel analysis of randomized approximate distributed maximal matchings in bipartite graphs , which we combine with the results from section  [ sec : prop ] to connect the approximate matchings generated by our algorithm to the graph vertex expansion .",
    "we note that it is not _ a priori _ obvious that mobility makes rumor spreading more difficult .",
    "it remains an open question , therefore , as to whether this @xmath37 factor is an artifact of our analysis or a reflection of something fundamental about changing topologies .",

    "_ one answer , we now know , goes as follows .",
    "if you know the rumor , randomly choose a nearby member that does not know the rumor and attempt to whisper it in their ear .",

    "( this signal can be agreed upon in advance or decided by the source and spread along with the rumor . )",
    "this simple strategy  which effectively implements ppush in the conference hall  will spread the rumor fast with respect to the crowd topology s vertex expansion , and it will do so in a way that copes elegantly and automatically to any level of encountered topology changes . more practically speaking , we argue that in the new world of mobile peer - to - peer networking , something like ppush is probably the right primitive to use to spread information efficiently through an unknown and potentially changing network .",
    "the telephone model described above was first introduced by frieze and grimmett  @xcite . a key problem in this model is _",
    "rumor spreading _ : a rumor must spread from a single source to the whole network . in studying this problem , algorithmic simplicity",
    "is typically prioritized over absolute optimality . the push algorithm ( first mentioned  @xcite ) , for example , simply has every node with the message choose a neighbor with uniform randomness and send it the message . the pull algorithm ( first mentioned  @xcite ) , by contrast ,",

    "the second case is that @xmath274 .",
    "we will now show that if this is true then , with high probability in @xmath21 , in one additional round of the algorithm we inform enough new nodes to satisfy objective @xmath29 of the lemma .",
    "to do so , first recall that by definition , every node in @xmath261 has a degree at most @xmath230 , and therefore any given edge in @xmath263 is selected by a @xmath261 node with probability at least @xmath275 .",
    "for each @xmath276 , let @xmath243 be the expected number of proposals that @xmath5 receives from nodes in @xmath261 during this round .",
    "using our above lower bound on edge selection probability , we can calculate : @xmath277 \\geq deg_{l_2 ' , r_2'}(v)/\\delta_i.$ ] let @xmath278 be the total number of proposals received by @xmath260 nodes from @xmath261 nodes . by linearity of expectation :      as defined , @xmath280 is _ not _ necessarily the sum of independent random variables , as there could be dependencies between different @xmath245 values .",
    "however , it is straightforward to verify that for any @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath243 are _ negatively associated _ : @xmath4 receiving more proposal can only reduce the number of proposals received by @xmath5 . because we can apply a chernoff bound to negatively associated random variables , we can achieve concentration around the expected value for @xmath280 . note that @xmath283 \\geq c\\log{n}$ ] as otherwise the claim of the lemma reduces to informing just one node which holds trivially .",
    "it follows that with high probability in @xmath18 , we have @xmath284 .    we are not yet done .",
    "recall that @xmath280 describes the total number of _ proposals _ received by nodes in @xmath260 , not the total number of _ nodes _ in @xmath260 that receive proposals .",
    "it is , however , this later quantity that we care about .",
    "fortunately , at this step we can leverage step # 2 , during which , with high probability , we removed all nodes in @xmath237 that expected to receive at least @xmath285 proposals .",
    "in other words , w.h.p .",
    ", for every @xmath276 : @xmath277 \\in o(\\log{n})$ ] .    for any @xmath276",
    ", we can bound the probability that @xmath286 , for some sufficiently large constant @xmath287 , to be polynomially small in @xmath18 ( with an exponent that increases with @xmath259 ) . by a union bound ,",
    "the probability that any node in @xmath260 receives more than @xmath288 values is still polynomially small in @xmath18 .",
    "assume , therefore , that this @xmath288 upper bound holds for all nodes .",
    "it follows that if @xmath284 , the number of unique nodes receiving proposals is at least @xmath289 .",
    "we can simple combine the high probability bounds on the size of @xmath280 being large and the size of @xmath243 being small ( for every relevant @xmath5 ) , by a simple union bound on all of those events , as each holds with high probability in @xmath18 and we certainly have at most @xmath290 such events .",
    "pulling together the pieces , we have shown that if the degree sum on @xmath261 is too large , then with high probability in @xmath18 at least @xmath291 new nodes are informed in this round  satisfying the lemma .    to conclude",
    ", we note that the above analysis only applies to the number of nodes in @xmath260 that are informed by nodes in @xmath261 .",
    "it is , of course , possible that some nodes in @xmath260 are also informed by nodes outside of @xmath261 .",
    "this behavior can only help this step of the proof as we are proving a lower bound on the number of informed nodes and this can only increase the actual value .",
    "we now leverage lemma  [ lem : matching1 ] to prove theorem  [ thm : matching ] .",
    "the following argument establishes a base case that satisfies the lemma preconditions of lemma  [ lem : matching1 ] and then repeatedly applies it @xmath67 times . either : ( 1 ) a matching of sufficient size is generated along the way ( i.e. , case @xmath29 of the lemma statement applies ) ; or ( 2 ) we begin round @xmath67 with a set @xmath181 with size in @xmath292 that has an average degree in @xmath293in which case it is easy to show that in the final round we get a matching of size @xmath294 .",
    "fix a bipartite graph @xmath6 with bipartitions @xmath153 and @xmath154 with a matching of size @xmath295 , and a value @xmath67 , as specified by the theorem statement preconditions . if @xmath185 , the claim follows directly from .",
    "assume in the following , therefore , that @xmath186 .",
    "we claim that we can apply lemma  [ lem : matching1 ] to @xmath296 , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 . to see why , notice that this definition of @xmath181 satisfies the preconditions @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath299 .",
    "it also satisfies the condition requiring all of the uninformed neighbors of @xmath181 to be in @xmath182 . finally , because we fixed @xmath298 , it holds that : @xmath300 , as there are @xmath107 nodes in @xmath181 each with a maximum degree of @xmath21 .",
    "consider this first application of lemma  [ lem : matching1 ] .",
    "it tells us that , w.h.p . , either we finish after one or two rounds , or after a single round we identify a smaller bipartitate graph @xmath301 , where @xmath223 and @xmath220 satisfy all the properties needed to apply the lemma to @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 .",
    "we can keep applying this lemma inductively , each time increasing the value of @xmath305 , until either : ( 1 ) we get through @xmath306 ; ( 2 ) an earlier application of the lemma generates a sufficiently large matching to satisfy the theorem ; or ( 3 ) at some point before either option 1 or 2 , the lemma fails to hold .",
    "since the third possibility happens with probability polynomially small in @xmath18 at each application , we can use a union bound and conclude that with high probability , it does not happen in any of the iterations . ignoring this negligible probability ,",
    "we focus on the other two possibilities .    before that , let us discuss a small nuance in applying the lemma @xmath67 times .",
    "we need to ensure that the specified @xmath181 sets are always of size at least @xmath307 , as required to keep applying the lemma .",
    "notice , however , that we start with an @xmath181 set of size @xmath107 , and the lemma guarantees it decreases by a factor of at most @xmath308 . therefore , after @xmath309 applications , @xmath310 .",
    "going back to the two possibilities , if option 2 holds , we are done . on the other hand ,",
    "if option 1 holds , we have one final step in our argument . in this case",
    ", we end up with having identified a bipartite subgraph @xmath301 with a maximum matching of size at least @xmath311 .",
    "we also know @xmath312 as @xmath306 . in this case , it holds trivially that at most @xmath313 nodes @xmath4 of @xmath223 have @xmath314 .",
    "hence , at least @xmath313 nodes @xmath4 have degree at most @xmath315 .",
    "now , each of these proposes to its own match in @xmath220 with probability at least @xmath316 .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath317 nodes of @xmath220 to receive proposals directly from their matches",
    ". note that these events are independent .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath318 as otherwise the claim of the theorem would be trivial .",
    "therefore , w.h.p .",
    ", @xmath317 nodes of @xmath220 receive proposals from their pairs .",
    "hence , at least @xmath317 nodes of @xmath220 get informed , thus completing the proof .",
    "divide the rounds into _ stable phases _ each consisting of @xmath13 rounds , such that the graph does not change during a stable phase .",
    "we label these phases @xmath319 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the node set for @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath320 , for some phase @xmath321 , be the subset of _ informed _ nodes that know rumor at the beginning of phase @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath322 , where @xmath2 is the node set of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath323 be the approximation factor on the maximum matching provided by theorem  [ thm : matching ] .",
    "we define the notion of a _ good _ phase with respect to this approximation factor :      notice , the factor of @xmath105 in the above definition comes from lemma  [ lem : msize ] , from our earlier analysis connecting the size of a maximum matching across any partition to the vertex expansion of the graph .",
    "we next bound the number of good phases needed to complete rumor spreading .",
    "intuitively , until the rumor spreads to at least half the nodes , each good phase increases the number of informed nodes by a fractional factor of at least @xmath328 .",
    "given that we start with @xmath29 informed node , after @xmath95 such increases , the number of informed nodes is at least @xmath329 ( by fact  [ fact : prob ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath330 good phases to get the rumor to at least half the nodes .    once we have informed half the nodes , we can flip our perspective .",
    "we now decrease our uninformed nodes by a factor of at least @xmath89 .",
    "if we start with no more than @xmath98 uninformed nodes , then after @xmath95 good phases , the number of uninformed nodes left is no more than @xmath331 ( also by fact  [ fact : prob ] ) .",
    "similar to before , @xmath332 good phases is sufficient to reduce these remaining nodes down to a constant number at which we can complete the rumor spreading .",
    "( see the proof of lemma  [ lem : gamma ] for the details of this style of argument . )",
    "we capture this intuition formally as follows :          we begin by focusing on the probability that a given phase is good .",
    "it is in this analysis that we pull together many of the threads woven so far throughout this paper .",
    "in particular , we consider the partition between informed and uniformed nodes .",
    "the maximum matching between these partitions describe the maximum number of new nodes that might be informed .",
    "we can leverage theorem  [ thm : matching ] to prove that with at least constant probability , we spread rumors to at least a @xmath334-fraction of this matching .",
    "we then leverage our earlier analysis of the relationship between matchings and vertex expansion , to show that this matching generates a factor of @xmath335 increase in informed nodes ( or decrease in uninformed , depending on what stage we are in the analysis ) .",
    "this matches our definition of _ good_. formally :      consider the maximum matching @xmath116 between the partitions @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "let @xmath339 .",
    "a direct implication of lemma  [ lem : msize ] ( see the equivalent formulation in the first line of the proof ) , is the following :      we now apply theorem  [ thm : matching ] to bound what fraction of this matching we can expect to inform in the @xmath13 rounds of the phase that follows . in more detail ,",
    "set @xmath153 to be the @xmath107 nodes in @xmath116 from @xmath337 , set @xmath154 to be the uninformed neighbors of nodes in @xmath153 , and set @xmath344 .",
    "it is easy to verify that these values satisfy the preconditions of theorem  [ thm : matching ] .",
    "the theorem tells us that with constant probability , at least @xmath345 new nodes learn the message in this phase .",
    "combined with our case analysis from above , it follows that if if @xmath346 , then this is at least @xmath347 new nodes , and if @xmath342 then this is at least @xmath348 new nodes . in both cases ,",
    "we have satisfied the definition of _ good _ with constant probability .    we know from lemma  [ lem : good:2 ] that each phase is good with constant probability . we know from lemma  [ lem : good ] , that @xmath349 good phases are sufficient .",
    "we must now combine these two observations to determine how many phases are needed to generate @xmath349 good phases with high probability .",
    "let @xmath352 be the number of good phases out of the first @xmath353 phases .",
    "by linearity of expectation and lemma  [ lem : good:2 ] : @xmath354 . combining this observation with lemma  [ lem : good ]",
    "it follows that the _ expected time _ to solve rumor spreading with ppush is in @xmath355 .",
    "we are seeking , however , a high probability bound to prove theorem  [ thm : ppush ] .",
    "we can not simply apply a chernoff bound to concentrate around @xmath356 , as for @xmath357 , @xmath350 and @xmath358 are not necessarily independent .",
    "our final theorem proof will leverage a stochastic dominance argument to overcome this obstacle .    according to lemma  [ lem : good:2 ]",
    ", there exists some constant probability @xmath336 that lower bounds , for every phase , the probability that the phase is good . for each @xmath95",
    ", we define a trivial random variable @xmath359 that is @xmath29 with independent probability @xmath336 , and otherwise @xmath360 . by definition , for each phase @xmath95 , regardless of the history through phase @xmath361 , @xmath350 stochastically dominates @xmath359 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath362 is greater than @xmath363 with some probability @xmath364 , then @xmath365 is greater than @xmath363 with probability at least @xmath364 .",

    "it follows the same holds for @xmath365 . by lemma  [ lem : good ] , this is a sufficient number of good phases to solve rumor spreading . to obtain the final round bound we first note that the upper bound @xmath353 on phases simplifies as : @xmath368                n.  fountoulakis and k.  panagiotou .",
