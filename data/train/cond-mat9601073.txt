    "these are generally attributed to correlation effects , nevertheless a unifying theory still remains a challenge .",
    "in this article we will address several questions related to the theoretical understanding of the normal - state properties of cuprates :    \\a ) can strong correlations alone account for the unusual normal - state properties , as manifested by the charge response : optical conductivity @xmath2 and d.c .",

    "\\c ) how many relevant energy scales exist in the doped afm ?",
    "\\d ) are the simplest prototype models , such as the @xmath0 model ( and analogous hubbard model ) , enough to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively experimental results in cuprates ?",
    "\\f ) can we learn something by studying small correlated systems at @xmath1 ?",
    "from the recent experiments testing the normal - state properties such as the d.c .",
    "resistivity @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , and the nmr and nqr relaxation @xcite , a unifying picture seems to emerge @xcite .",
    "these properties mainly depend on the extent of doping , and the regimes have been classified into the underdoped , the ` optimal ' ( intermediate - doping ) , and the overdoped , respectively .",
    "whereas the ` optimal ' doping refers in a narrow sense usually to samples with the highest @xmath12 , the same broader region of doping , with effective hole concentration approx .",
    "@xmath13 @xcite , also exhibits most universal properties . down to",
    "the lowest @xmath14 resistivity follows the remarkable @xmath15 law , the uniform susceptibility @xmath16 is varying monotonously with @xmath4 , etc . on the other hand , the underdoped materials ( effective @xmath17 )",
    "are characterized by the onset of the ` pseudogap ' at @xmath18 , which shows up in the kinks in @xmath19 , @xmath8 etc .",
    "we investigate in this review mainly the intermediate - doping ( optimal ) regime .",
    "we discuss finite-@xmath4 ( normal - state ) properties of the doped afm within the @xmath0 model @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 are projected fermionic operators , prohibiting double occupancy of sites .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath0 model and related properties have been intensively studied both by analytical @xcite and numerical methods @xcite , nevertheless some basic questions , e.g. concerning possible pairing in the ground state and the origin of anomalous metallic properties at finite @xmath1 , remain unsolved .",
    "normal metals are expected to follow the concept of the * landau fermi liquid*. the excitations in this case should be quasiparticles with well defined @xmath22 and energy @xmath23 near the fermi energy , with the damping @xmath24 .",
    "consequences are well known , e.g. for the dynamical susceptibility @xmath25 leading to the korringa law @xmath26 .",
    "also , the drude form is expected for @xmath2 with @xmath27 etc .",
    "the normal - state properties of cuprates , however , do not follow the landau scenario .",
    "experiments have been mainly described within two alternative concepts .",
    "the * nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid * has been introduced by moriya and millis et al .",
    "@xcite to describe the spin fluctuations in the doped afm , mainly in connection with the anomalous nmr relaxation phenomena in cuprates .",
    "the low-@xmath6 spin response is modeled with the overdamped spin fluctuations peaked at the afm wavevector @xmath28 , @xmath29 ^ 2 } .\\label{eq32}\\ ] ] afm correlation length @xmath30 is assumed to be critical in the doped regime , in particular with @xmath31 in the @xmath32 dynamical rpa - type theory @xcite , while the postulated mapping to the quantum critical regime of the nonlinear sigma model would imply @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "alternative scenario has been summarized within the * marginal fermi liquid * ( mfl ) hypothesis @xcite . here , the spin and charge susceptibility have been postulated in the anomalous form @xmath34 leading to the marginality of the quasiparticle self energy @xmath35 consistent with eq.([eq34 ] ) , the low - frequency @xmath2 has been written in the generalized drude form introducing an anomalous effective relaxation rate @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath1 properties of the @xmath0 model have been so far calculated only by the high - temperature series expansion @xcite and via full or partial diagonalization of quite small systems .",
    "recently the present authors introduced a novel numerical method , based on the lanczos diagonalization method combined with random sampling @xcite .",
    "the latter method has the advantage that it allows the study of dynamical and static response functions within the most challenging regime @xmath37 , where one could hope for a universal behavior , as observed in the experiments on cuprates .",
    "it should be noted that analogous hubbard model seems more feasible for @xmath1 studies , due to the possible application of the quantum monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the doped case the well known minus sign problem so far mainly prevented calculations within the regime @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "let us present briefly our method for @xmath1 calculations , showing in more detail the evaluation of the statical expectation value of an operator @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( we use @xmath42 furtheron ) and the sum runs over the chosen complete basis set of orthonormal wavefunctions @xmath43 , spanning the hamiltonian @xmath44 . if we could perform the full diagonalization of the problem and find all eigenstates @xmath45 and corresponding energies @xmath46 , we would express the result in a usual way , @xmath47    we choose an alternative approach . with each basis function",
    "@xmath48 we start a lanczos procedure @xmath49 , generating an orthonormal set of functions @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the chosen number of lanczos steps @xmath52 we then diagonalize the tridiagonal matrix of coefficients @xmath53 to find the energies @xmath54 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath55 . within the restricted basis of these functions one can write the approximation for eq.([eq52 ] ) as @xmath56",
    "it is evident that the average evaluated via eq.([eq54 ] ) is equivalent to eq.([eq52 ] ) for the sampling over the full basis set @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "our claim is that very accurate results can be obtained via eq.([eq54 ] ) even for a severly reduced number of lanczos steps @xmath59 and for a partial random sampling of the basis states @xmath60 , instead of the full sampling .",
    "let us first investigate the method for the full sampling @xmath57 .",
    "we note that the lanczos procedure eq.([eq53 ] ) represents an iterative action of the operator @xmath44 on the initial function @xmath48 .",
    "performing the ( high temperature ) expansion in @xmath61 of the numerator and of the denominator of eq.([eq54 ] ) , it is easy to prove that both power series are correct up to the order @xmath62 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath63 evaluated via eq.([eq54 ] ) is accurate also for @xmath64 ( provided @xmath65 ) , since it is a standard experience that the lanczos procedure converges quite rapidly , typically in @xmath66 steps , from an arbitrary initial function @xmath48 ( not orthogonal to the ground state ) to the ground state energy @xmath67 and the corresponding wavefunction @xmath68 .",
    "hence , at full sampling our lanczos - based method represents an optimum interpolation scheme between the high temperature @xmath69 and the ground state @xmath64 result .",
    "the second important ingredient is the reduction of the sampling to the partial random one with @xmath60 .",
    "this step can not be justified rigorously , but seems plausible in analogy with the statistical monte carlo methods .",
    "the most severe test is expected to be the result at @xmath64 , which can be anyhow tested via an alternative direct evaluation with the known @xmath68 .",
    "the general experience is that good convergence is achieved for @xmath60 .",
    "even more appealing is the application of the method to the calculation of dynamical quantities .",
    "we choose as an example the optical conductivity , expressed within the linear response theory as @xmath70 in order to get the result at arbitrary @xmath61 a double sum over all eigenstates @xmath71 is required .",
    "instead , we use the approach described above for @xmath63 generalized to dynamical @xmath72 , @xmath73 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are generated by the lanczos procedure analogous to eq.([eq53 ] ) via the orthonormal basis set @xmath76 , but with the initial condition @xmath77 while for @xmath78 the expression ( [ eq58 ] ) is equivalent to the exact one , the arguments for using @xmath60 and @xmath59 are analogous to those described above for the static case .",
    "e.g. , for the full sampling @xmath57 eq.([eq58 ] ) yields correct series in @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , up to the @xmath81 order .",
    "accordingly , @xmath2 has correct frequency moments @xmath82 , for @xmath83 etc .",
    "again for @xmath65 the method yields meaningful result also for @xmath64 , which can be tested via the usual lanczos method for the @xmath64 dynamical quantities @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that computational requirements of the method for a system of the given size are comparable to those for the ground state evalutions via the lanczos method , whereby the cpu time clearly increases with the number of random samples @xmath84 .",
    "the cpu time and memory requirements are also enhanced due to the necessary reorthogonalization of lanczos functions and due to the evaluation of matrix elements in eq.([eq58 ] ) .",
    "let us finally comment on the finite size effects , which due to the restricted system sizes still remain the main obstacle to achieve reliable results for low @xmath4 .",
    "it is a plausible observation that the method yields macroscopic - like results for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is roughly determined by the average level separation in the low - energy many - body spectrum , being dependent on the system size . for @xmath87",
    "the finite - size effects become pronounced , e.g. dynamical quantities in general reveal ( spurious ) peak structures etc .",
    "it is however very important to note that within the @xmath0 model , the @xmath86 is smallest within the intermediate ( optimum ) doping regime @xmath88 , where we typically reach @xmath89 for systems @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath86 is larger both within the underdoped and the overdoped region ( for the fixed system size ) .",
    "let us consider the dynamical spin response , as given by the susceptibility @xmath91 and the corresponding dynamical spin correlation function @xmath92 @xmath93 it has been shown by the present authors @xcite that @xmath94 shows the coexistence of the high - frequency ( @xmath95 ) free - fermion - like contribution and the low-@xmath6 spin - fluctuation contribution .",
    "at the same time , @xmath96 reveals a pronounced @xmath4 dependence , consistent with the mfl form , and ( even quantitatively ) with the nmr relaxation in cuprates .",
    "it appears quite helpful to concentrate on the local spin correlation function @xmath97 @xcite and its symmetric part @xmath98 @xmath99 it should be pointed out that @xmath97 and the related susceptibility @xmath100 are directly measured ( in cuprates ) by neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the nmr relaxation as well yields the information on @xmath101 @xcite , provided that the afm spin fluctuations @xmath102 are dominant .",
    "an important restriction for @xmath103 is the sum rule @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hole concentration .",
    "we perform the evaluation of @xmath103 via eq.([eq3 ] ) by calculating @xmath106 , using the finite-@xmath4 diagonalization method for small systems , in this case for the @xmath0 model on the square lattice with @xmath107 sites .",
    "we fix @xmath108 to remain in the regime of cuprates @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the method yields macroscopic - like results for @xmath109 .    in fig .  1 we display the @xmath103 for @xmath110 and several @xmath4 in the range @xmath111 @xcite",
    "it is immediately evident that @xmath103 at ` optimal ' doping @xmath112 is essentially @xmath4-independent in a wide @xmath4-range , although one crosses the exchange - energy scale @xmath113 . for the underdoped case @xmath114 the behavior is analogous for higher @xmath115 , consistent with the quantum critical regime within the afm @xcite .",
    "deviations at lower @xmath116 ( where the renormalized classical regime @xcite is expected in the afm ) could be an indication for the onset of a ` pseudogap ' .    to follow the doping dependence we present in fig .",
    "2 the variation with @xmath117 at fixed @xmath118 , plotting the integrated intensity @xmath119 again , we notice that for the chosen @xmath4 the results are most reliable at the intermediate doping .",
    "the most striking message is that the initial slope of @xmath120 and consequently @xmath101 are nearly doping independent for @xmath121 .",
    "this is well consistent with the nmr ( nqr ) relaxation rates @xmath122 as measured in @xmath123 in the range @xmath124 @xcite .    only for the overdoped systems with @xmath125 the low - frequency behavior changes qualitatively , where the latter part is strongly suppressed as expected in ( more ) normal fermi liquids .",
    "@xmath126 is doping dependent even for @xmath127 , consistent with the @xmath117-dependence of the sum rule , eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "in addition , at the intermediate doping @xmath103 decreases smoothly ( see fig .",
    "1 ) up to @xmath128 , this being the consequence of a free - fermion - like component @xcite . on the other hand , in the underdoped regime the dynamics",
    "is restricted to @xmath129 .",
    "how can one explain the universality of @xmath103 at intermediate @xmath117 ?",
    "first , we note that up to @xmath130 the dominant scale of spin fluctuations remains related to @xmath131 . from the explicit expression in terms of the eigenstates of the system",
    "@xmath132 one would conjecture ( quite generally ) a @xmath4-independence of response for @xmath133 .",
    "although such plausibility arguments have been used previously , their validity clearly depends on the character and on the density of low - lying many - body states . to explain also the @xmath4-independence of @xmath134",
    ", we only need to recall the sum rule eq.([eq4 ] ) and to assume that there is no characteristic scale @xmath135 , which could introduce an additional low-@xmath6 structure in @xmath98 .",
    "a natural scale for the afm is the ( gap ) frequency @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the spin wave velocity and @xmath138 the afm correlation length .",
    "here originates the essential difference between the undoped and the ` optimally ' doped afm . while for an afm in the renormalized classical regime @xmath138 is exponentially large for @xmath139 , and consequently @xmath140 @xcite , in the doped case @xmath141 is determined predominantly by @xmath117",
    ", so @xmath138 is rather @xmath4-independent for @xmath142 , excluding @xmath143 . in other words ,",
    "the observed anomalous low-@xmath6 behavior within the @xmath0 model does not originate in a strong @xmath4-dependence of @xmath138 , as conjectured by the nearly afm fermi liquid , eq.([eq32 ] ) .",
    "we conclude the discussion of spin dynamics by the consequences of the universality of @xmath103 .",
    "the local susceptibility is given by @xmath144 since neutron scattering probes only @xmath145 , one can simplify eq.([eq7 ] ) further by @xmath146 .",
    "such form has been recently used to describe experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also qualitatively consistent ( but as well more restricted in the form ) with the mfl ansatz , eq.([eq33 ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us investigate in an analogous way the dynamical conductivity @xmath2 , eq.([eq56 ] ) .",
    "results for this quantity by the present authors @xcite , obtained by the finite-@xmath4 method , can be summarized as follows : a ) in the intermediate - doping regime @xmath2 shows a non - drude fall - off , consistent with the @xmath6-dependent relaxation rate within the mfl concept eq.([eq34 ] ) @xcite , deduced from experiments in cuprates @xcite , and b ) qualitative as well as quantitative results for @xmath2 and @xmath19 agree well with the experimental ones .    unlike @xmath103",
    ", @xmath5 does not obey a @xmath4-independent sum rule .",
    "nevertheless , motivated by the universal spin dynamics we reexamine in an analogous manner our results on @xmath2 @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 we present the corresponding integrated spectra @xmath147 at fixed doping in the ` optimal ' regime for various @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "we establish that for @xmath149 spectra @xmath150 are essentially independent of @xmath4 , at least for the available @xmath85 . at the same time the slope of @xmath151",
    "is nearly constant , i.e. @xmath152 in a wide @xmath6-range , @xmath153 being weakly @xmath131-dependent ( tested for @xmath154 ) .",
    "we note that such @xmath155 implies a nonanalytic behavior of @xmath156 , starting with a finite slope at @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath158 we can claim a simple universal form for @xmath159 @xmath160 at first sight , it appears rather surprising that this form can be well fitted ( for @xmath161 ) with a drude - type form with an mfl - like effective relaxation rate @xmath162 with specific @xmath163 and @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the form eq.([eq10 ] ) for @xmath2 trivially reproduces the remarkable linear law @xmath165 in cuprates @xcite , as well as the non - drude falloff at @xmath166 .    a quantitative comparison ( assuming @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) of @xmath2 with the experimental results @xcite is quite remarkable @xcite , realizing the simplicity of the model .",
    "it is however evident that the expression ( [ eq10 ] ) is more restricted than the mfl ansatz , hence it should be retested in more detail with experiments .    it should be mentioned that @xmath169 has been derived for a single hole conductivity within the retraceable path approximation @xcite , with a restricted validity for @xmath170 ( or possibly @xmath171 ) .",
    "we find this behavior only for the intermediate doping , hence new arguments are needed .",
    "we can follow the analysis analogous to @xmath98 , eq.([eq6 ] ) , expressing @xmath5 in terms of the eigenstates .",
    "as before , the @xmath4-independence of @xmath172 seems plausible . the fact that @xmath173 requires , however , that the current relaxation is very fast , i.e. determined only by the incoherent hopping and by the interhole collisions .",
    "the spin fluctuation scale @xmath131 does not enter directly , i.e. even for @xmath139 the spin system only serves as a random bath for the charge degrees of freedom ( holons ) .",
    "this conclusion remains valid as far as there is no characteristic frequency @xmath174 ( e.g. the ` pseudogap ' ) in the system .",
    "on the other hand , our results also indicate the possible qualitative changes when entering the underdoped regime .",
    "e.g. the @xmath175 doping seems to represent a crossover to the latter behavior , where in contrast ( e.g. for @xmath114 ) we find a pronounced @xmath4- and @xmath6-dependence of @xmath5 at @xmath176 .",
    "this qualitative change can be again attributed to a ` pseudogap ' appearing at larger @xmath4 in the underdoped systems @xcite .",
    "above arguments , both for @xmath97 and @xmath5 , require a large density ( degeneracy ) of the low lying many - body states , apparently being a crucial feature for the most challenging intermediate - doping regime . to quantify this statement we calculate the entropy density @xmath177 , using again the finite-@xmath4 diagonalization method , being less space and time consuming for static quantities @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we present the results for @xmath178 , obtained for @xmath179 and @xmath180 at different @xmath4 .",
    "the main lesson from fig .",
    "4 is that the ` optimal ' cases with @xmath181 are characterized by the largest entropy @xmath182 at low @xmath142 , e.g. @xmath183site for @xmath184 , being almost one half of @xmath185 for an afm .",
    "this implies a very large degeneracy of the low - lying states , which could be attributed to the spin subsystem , frustrated by the hole motion .",
    "calculated entropy , large even at moderate @xmath4 and strongly dependent on doping , seems to be ( also quantitatively ) consistent with the specific heat measurements on cuprates @xcite .",
    "our results for the @xmath0 model seem to indicate that the anomalous , but universal , dynamics in the intermediate - doping regime of correlated systems is a consequence of an extreme degeneracy and a collapse of the low - lying quantum states ( introduced by doping the magnetic insulator ) .",
    "this leads to a diffusive - like charge and spin response , where @xmath4 represents the only relevant energy ( frequency ) scale . on the other hand",
    ", our results do not exclude the possible onset of coherence ( related to ` pseudogaps ' and superconductivity ) at lower @xmath186 .",
    "it is evident that the ` optimal ' doping regime is characterized by the competing influence of two quantum processes : afm fluctuations and hole hopping . outside this regime",
    ", either one of the two processes should dominate .    to show that such physics is indeed incorporated within the @xmath0 model , we present our results for the uniform susceptibility @xmath8 at various hole dopings @xmath117 . from fig.5",
    "we establish that @xmath8 is most monotonous within the intermediate - doping regime . on the other hand , for @xmath187",
    "the susceptibility starts to reveal a shoulder at @xmath188 , which could be interpreted as an increase of the pseudogap scale , but as well as a sign of the dominating role of the afm fluctuations .",
