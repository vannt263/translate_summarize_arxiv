    "the exploration of phase transitions in simple , one component nonequilibrium models has attracted considerable interest @xcite , and important steps towards identifying the related universality classes have been achieved @xcite . in nonequilibrium models phase transitions may occur even in one - dimensional systems : the well known arguments , due to landau and to van hove @xcite , against phase transitions in one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions , do not apply in the absence of detailed balance . however in low dimensions the effect of fluctuations is stronger , making continuous phase transitions more common .",
    "( a familiar example is the three - state potts model , which exhibits a continuous transition in two dimensions , and a discontinuous one for @xmath3 . )    in one dimension , discontinuous phase transitions have been found in models with long - range interactions @xcite , or a conserved density @xcite , and in multi - component systems @xcite .",
    "compact directed percolation ( cdp ) has a discontinuous transition between a pair of absorbing states ( all sites full or all empty ) @xcite ; a similar transition between absorbing states is found in the one - dimensional ziff - gulari - barshad model @xcite .",
    "a discontinuous transition between and active phase and an absorbing one in a single - component model was claimed for the triplet creation model ( tcm ) @xcite , which does not possess a conservation law or long - range interactions .",
    "this model features particle reactions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and explicit diffusion ( hopping ) @xcite . on increasing the diffusion probability , a crossover from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition",
    "was detected in simulations and cluster mean - field approximations .",
    "similar behavior was also reported in a stochastic cellular automaton @xcite .",
    "subsequently , hinrichsen argued that in one dimension , discontinuous transitions between an active and an absorbing state can not exist in models like the tcm @xcite .",
    "the original findings for the tcm @xcite were nevertheless confirmed in spreading simulations by cardoso and fontanari @xcite and in fixed order - parameter simulations by fiore and de oliveira @xcite .",
    "the spreading exponents are shown in @xcite to be those of compact directed percolation ( cdp ) @xcite ; a tricritical point is suggested for a diffusion probability @xmath4 .",
    "very recently park @xcite reported simulation results that again support a continuous phase transition , belonging to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class , at high diffusion rates .    recently ,",
    "a field theoretic analysis of bosonic reaction - diffusion ( rd ) models led to a hypothesis @xcite , based on a general phase transition classification scheme : _ bosonic , one - component rd systems with @xmath2-particle creation and @xmath5-particle annihilation always exhibit a first - order transition if @xmath6_. this is indeed the case above the upper critical dimension ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however in bosonic models one has to introduce a higher - order coagulation term @xmath7 with ( @xmath8 ) , to avoid an infinite particle density in the active phase .",
    "furthermore the topological phase space method used in @xcite deals with the reactions ( creation and annihilation ) , but does not take into account the effect of diffusion , which turns out to be relevant in some cases , when different reactions compete @xcite .    in this work we study the tcm in an effort to determine whether multi - particle creation , combined with rapid diffusion , can overcome fluctuations and generate a discontinuous phase transition in one dimension .",
    "this is a problem of longstanding interest in nonequilibrium statistical physics , and is related to the existence of first - order depinning transition in nonequilibrium wetting ( i.e. , in a system with multiplicative noise , with an attractive wall ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the model , and review applicable simulation methods and previous results regarding the nature of the phase transition .",

    "vi we summarize our findings .",
    "the tcm is defined on a lattice , with each site either vacant or occupied by a particle ; multiple occupancy is forbidden @xcite . in the one - dimensional tcm , a particle ( @xmath9 ) attempts diffusion at rate @xmath10 , creation ( @xmath11 ) at rate @xmath12 , and is annihilated ( @xmath13 ) at rate @xmath14 . in a diffusion attempt ,",
    "one of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites of the particle is chosen at random , and the particle jumps to this site if it is empty .",
    "if the target site is occupied , the configuration remains the same . in a creation attempt ,",
    "if both nn sites of the particle are occupied , then one of the second - neighbor sites of the central particle is chosen at random , and if this site is empty , a new particle is placed there .",
    "if the conditions of two occupied nn sites and an empty target site are not fulfilled , the configuration does not change .",
    "annihilation occurs independently of the states of neighboring sites .",
    "the configuration with all sites empty is absorbing . since the sum of these transition rates is unity , the total transition rate in a system with @xmath15 particles is simply @xmath15 . in simulations ,",
    "the time increment associated with each attempted event ( whether accepted or not ) is @xmath16 , and one monte carlo step ( mcs ) corresponds to an accumulated time increment of unity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the one - dimensional tcm was shown to exhibit a phase transition between the active and absorbing states ; the transition was found to be continuous ( and in the dp universality class ) for smaller diffusion rates , but discontinuous for large @xmath17 . by a discontinuous transition",
    "we mean one in which the order parameter is a discontinuous function of the relevant control parameter(s ) , in the infinite - size limit . in the tcm the order parameter is the particle density @xmath18 , and the control parameters are @xmath19 and @xmath17 . since one of the phases is absorbing , at a discontinuous transition @xmath18 should jump between zero and a finite value .",
    "the characterization of a transition as continuous or discontinuous in numerical simulations is fraught with difficulties : finite - size rounding can mask the discontinuity , and any finite system must eventually become trapped in the absorbing state . to circumvent these problems , a number of strategies have been proposed .",
    "_ hysteresis with a weak source . _",
    "a characteristic feature of discontinuous phase transitions is hysteresis .",
    "if one of the phases is absorbing , however , hysteresis can not be observed simply by varying a control parameter , since the absorbing phase allows no escape .",
    "bideaux , boccara and chat @xcite showed that when the transition is discontinuous , adding a weak source of activity changes the absorbing and active phases to _ low - activity _ and _ high - activity _ phases , respectively .",
    "one may then observe a hysteresis loop between these phases , on varying the control parameter .",
    "this approach was used in @xcite to demonstrate a discontinuous phase transition in a probabilistic cellular automaton , and was applied to the tcm in @xcite , yielding a hysteresis loop .",
    "below , we shall revisit the question of scaling under a weak source .",
    "_ conserved order parameter simulations . _",
    "in conserved order parameter simulations @xcite , particles are neither created nor destroyed .",
    "changes in configuration occur through particle jumps , which can be of any size up to that of the entire system , in a manner that respects the local rules of the process .",
    "the simulation yields an estimate for the control parameter value corresponding to the chosen order parameter density .",
    "using this method , fiore and de oliveira found evidence for a discontinuous transition in both the tcm and the related pair creation model ( with creation reaction @xmath20 ) at high diffusion rates @xcite .    _ quasistationary ( qs ) simulation .",
    "_ as in conserved order parameter simulations , qs simulation removes the absorbing state from the dynamics , but in a manner that samples the quasistationary probability distribution ( i.e. , conditioned on survival ) @xcite .",
    "a study of the tcm using this method @xcite showed that as the system size tends to infinity , the qs order parameter appears to develop a discontinuity between zero and a positive value , as @xmath19 is varied at a high diffusion rate , @xmath21 .",
    "( for a finite system the discontinuity is of course rounded . )",
    "a study of the tcm with biased diffusion ( hopping in one direction only ) yielded evidence of a sharp discontinuity @xcite .",
    "_ spreading simulations .",
    "_ studies of the spread of activity , starting from a seed at the origin , have long been employed to characterize continuous phase transitions to an absorbing state @xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "the survival probability @xmath22 , mean number of active sites @xmath23 , and mean - square distance @xmath24 of active sites from the origin , all follow power laws . at a discontinuous transition ,",
    "there is in principle no reason to expect scale - invariant spreading dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of the tcm , cardoso and fontanari @xcite demonstrated power - law spreading at the transition point , @xmath25 , for @xmath21 .",
    "the scaling exponents were identified as those of cdp , which , as noted above , suffers a discontinuous transition between a pair of symmetric absorbing states .    _ interface motion . _",
    "suppose we prepare the system with all sites occupied , allow it to relax to the qs state , and then remove all particles from half of the lattice .",
    "in the subsequent evolution , the interface between active and inactive regions broadens due to diffusion , and in general drifts toward one region or the other .",
    "below we report studies showing that the drift velocity is proportional to @xmath26 . in a related analysis ,",
    "we initialize the system with all sites in the region @xmath27 occupied , and sites @xmath28 empty , and study the long - time survival probability @xmath29 . at the transition ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath30 is consistent with independent , randomly diffusing interfaces , as in cdp .",
    "this result supports the existence of two phases , one absorbing , the other active , separated by a large gap in density .",
    "the two phases do not coexist : the fluctuating interfaces eventually meet , and one of the phases is lost from the system .",
    "summarizing , the above mentioned studies , some from the recent literature , others to be reported below , provide evidence for a discontinuity in the qs order parameter , for hysteresis , and for a connection between the tcm at high diffusion rate and compact directed percolation .",
    "some years ago , hinrichsen presented an argument to the effect that discontinuous phase transitions between an active and an absorbing state are impossible in one - dimensional systems with local interactions , and without additional conservation laws , special boundary conditions , or macroscopic currents @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on the observation that the effective surface tension of interfaces in such systems does not depend on the size of the domains they delimit .",
    "hinrichsen s argument prohibits the presence of fixed , stable boundaries between coexisting phases ; as noted , no such boundaries have been observed in simulations . but this in itself does not appear to imply that the dependence of the order parameter on growth rate must be continuous at the transition . the one - dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , for example , exhibits a discontinuous phase transition in a certain region of parameter space , even though the position of the boundary between high- and low - density phases fluctuates over the entire system @xcite .",
    "hinrichsen @xcite also reported simulation results supporting a continuous transition in the tcm at diffusion rate @xmath31 , that is , above the estimate for @xmath32 given in @xcite .",
    "it is now generally acknowledged that @xmath33 in the tcm .    in a recent study @xcite ,",
    "park reported simulation results that support dp - like scaling in the tcm at diffusion rates 0.95 and 0.98 .",
    "specifically , the order parameter ( starting from a filled lattice ) appears to decay at long times as @xmath34 , with @xmath35 taking its dp value , over about two decades in time .",
    "we note however that the decay exponent is very sensitive to the choice of the time interval used for analysis and of the control parameter @xmath19 . analyzing simulation results for @xmath21 in studies extending to @xmath36 mcs",
    ", we obtain local decay exponents @xmath37 between 0.1 and 0.2 , varying @xmath19 in a very narrow range . a crossover between a long supercritical plateau for @xmath38 and a rapid decay to an inactive state can not be ruled out . for @xmath21 , the regime during which dp - like scaling is found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) corresponds to overall particle densities in the range 0.67 - 0.32 . while scaling behavior can be observed at such densities in the contact process @xcite , definitive results for the decay exponent would require studying systems with substantially smaller values of @xmath18",
    ". finally , three or more critical exponents would have to be determined to demonstrate convincingly that the transition falls in the dp class .",
    "although the results of hinrichsen and of park do not appear to rule out rigorously a discontinuous transition in the tcm , we believe that they are fundamentally correct . this conclusion is based not on simulation results but rather on a mapping to a modified cdp process , to be developed in sec .",
    "v. analysis of this mapping in leads to the conclusion that the transition is in fact continuous , despite abundant numerical evidence to the contrary .",
    "one of the most common theoretical approaches to markov processes with spatial structure is a truncation of the master equation known as an @xmath2-site approximation @xcite .",
    "such approximations have been applied to the tcm in efforts to determine the order of the transition ; in this section we review and extend these results .",
    "the simplest method in this family is dynamic mean - field theory or the _ one - site approximation _ , in which the probability of an @xmath5-site configuration is factored into a product of @xmath5 single - site probabilities , so that , for example , @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) denotes an occupied ( vacant ) site and @xmath18 is the fraction of occupied sites . the resulting equation for @xmath43 yields rather poor predictions for the tcm ; better results",
    "are obtained using larger clusters . in the @xmath2-site approximation ,",
    "the equations that govern the probability distribution for clusters of @xmath2 sites are truncated by expressing the probabilities of @xmath44 site ( or larger ) clusters in terms of the @xmath2-site distribution . in the 3-site approximation , for example",
    ", we write @xmath45 . as @xmath2 grows",
    ", the number and complexity of the equations increases rapidly , but it is possible to generate the equations , and integrate them numerically , via a computational algorithm @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 4-site approximation for the tcm was found to predict a continuous phase transition for diffusion rates @xmath46 and discontinuous one for @xmath47 .",
    "the predicted value for the tricritical diffusion rate @xmath32 , however , is much smaller than that reported in simulations ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the phase diagram predicted by the @xmath2-site approximation generally converges to the correct one as @xmath49 , it is of interest to study the results for larger @xmath2 . in certain cases , predictions",
    "based on a sequence of @xmath2-site approximations behave in a consistent manner , and can be extrapolated to provide estimates of the transition point and critical exponents , via the coherent anomaly method @xcite .    for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the position of @xmath32 varies considerably .",
    "for example , the @xmath50 approximations yield a discontinuous transition even for @xmath51 , but for @xmath52 there is a tricritical point at some @xmath53 . the estimates for @xmath32 increase gradually with @xmath2",
    "; for @xmath54 , one finds @xmath55 , for example . on the other hand , for a fixed , large diffusion rate ,",
    "the transition remains discontinuous , with a large jump in the order parameter , which does not diminish appreciably with increasing @xmath2 . for @xmath21 , for example , fig .",
    "[ cs_98 ] shows that all the approximations studied ( @xmath56 ) yield a discontinuous transition .",
    "recently , ferreira and fontanari published results casting doubt on the utility of @xmath2-site approximations for the tcm @xcite .",
    "they show , for example , that for @xmath51 , the values of @xmath25 veer _ away _ from the simulation value as @xmath2 is increased from 11 to 18 ; our studies confirm this observation .",
    "( we note that a nonmonotonic approach to the critical point is observed in a stochastic cellular automaton in which at least three particles are required for particle generation or survival @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the values of the tricritical reproduction rate @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 ) appear to converge to an unphysical ( negative ) value as @xmath49 @xcite .    thus if the @xmath2-site approximations converge to the correct values , they do so in a nonmonotonic fashion , such that for the cluster sizes accessible with present technology ( @xmath59 or so ) , quantitative results for @xmath25 can not be obtained for the tcm . although our @xmath2-site approximations show stable nonvanishing gap sizes at @xmath21 for @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ cs_98 ] ) , we find that for a given level ( @xmath61 , say ) , @xmath62 is not a monotonic function of @xmath17 , and the location of the tricritical point is rather uncertain .",
    "[ cs13tr ] shows that on increasing the diffusion rate from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , the critical point shifts to higher values , but for @xmath65 this tendency reverses . on the other hand",
    ", there is no evidence of a discontinuous transition for @xmath66 .",
    "our analysis provides a higher @xmath67 estimate for @xmath61 than found in @xcite ; the reason for this difference is not known , since our result for @xmath68 agrees with that reported in the latter work .",
    "we observe a similar behavior for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; our tricritical point estimates do not fit on the extrapolation line given in @xcite .    for",
    "the cluster sizes studied , @xmath71 can not be fit with a linear function of @xmath72 , so that the @xmath73 limiting value can not be estimated with confidence .",
    "it seems likely that @xmath71 exhibits an oscillatory convergence with @xmath2 ; if so , the question of whether @xmath74 , ( that is , the existence of a discontinuous transition ) , can not be resolved using the available @xmath2-site approximation results .",
    "we study the tcm via monte carlo simulation , using several approaches that complement earlier analyses : dependence on the initial value of the order parameter , interface dynamics , scaling in the presence of a weak source of activity , and scaling of the quasistationary order parameter .",
    "while some of the results would seem to provide good evidence of a discontinuous transition , we shall defer our conclusion until the following section .",
    "if a phase transition is discontinuous , the evolution of the system should depend strongly on the initial condition , while at a continuous transition the evolution is toward the same qs state , regardless of the initial condition . in @xcite ,",
    "simulations of the tcm at diffusion rate @xmath21 are reported , showing that at the transition ( @xmath75 ) , the value of the order parameter at long times depends on its initial value . for initial particle densities",
    "@xmath76 between 0.3 and unity , the system evolves to the active state , while for @xmath77 it rapidly approaches the absorbing state .",
    "( in studies using @xmath78 , the initially occupied sites are chosen at random , uniformly over the lattice . )",
    "these results demonstrate that an active phase , characterized by a high value of the order parameter , is accessible starting from a high density , but not from a low one .",
    "the findings for high diffusion rate are in sharp contrast to those found for @xmath51 , for which the critical reproduction rate is @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", the particle density attains the same qs value , starting from very different initial values .",
    "here we extend the simulations of @xcite to much larger systems .",
    "we follow the evolution of the order parameter @xmath80 in systems of @xmath81 sites ( with periodic boundary conditions ) for times of up to @xmath36 mcs , averaging over 5 -20 realizations . for @xmath21",
    ", we find that for low initial values ( @xmath82 ) , the density falls exponentially for @xmath83 ( see fig.[3410_98 ] ) .    for the same reproduction rates , using @xmath84 , the order parameter @xmath80 exhibits a long plateau ( @xmath85 mcs ) at a high density . at longer times",
    "@xmath80 decays , as expected in a finite system . for @xmath86 , by contrast , the order parameter curves @xmath80 , starting from high and low initial values , attain a common value at long times ( see fig.[3410_5 ] ) .      in these studies",
    "the initial configuration consists of two blocks , one fully occupied , of @xmath87 sites , and the other , of @xmath88 sites , completely empty . for @xmath21 and @xmath89 , one finds that in the initially occupied region , the particle density quickly relaxes to its qs value of about @xmath90 .",
    "the ensuing evolution is characterized by the drift of the boundaries between active and empty regions .",
    "a given realization stops either when it attains the absorbing state , or when the number of particles indicates that the active phase has filled the entire system ( we use a particle number of @xmath91 as the criterion for this event ) .",
    "figure [ qcnc7 ] shows a typical history for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( the graph shows the mean density in blocks of 50 sites , with time increasing downward , in steps of 10000 time units between each density profile . )",
    "the boundaries between active and inactive regions appear to follow independent , unbiased random walks .",
    "if the boundaries can be represented by independent , unbiased random walkers , then the number @xmath94 of particles ( which is approximated by @xmath95 times the size of the active region ) , should also follow an unbiased random walk .",
    "the walk starts at @xmath96 and is subject to absorbing frontiers at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "well known results on random walks @xcite then imply that the probability @xmath99 of reaching @xmath100 before @xmath97 is given by @xmath101 .",
    "we estimate @xmath99 in sets of 100 realizations , on rings of 500 , 1000 , and 2000 sites ; the linear trend evident in fig .",
    "[ tcrnc ] supports the fluctuating boundary interpretation .",
    "this in turn suggests that at high diffusion rates , the dynamics of active and inactive domains is effectively that of cdp .",
    "away from the phase transition , we expect the interface to drift on the average , advancing into the inactive region for @xmath102 and vice - versa .",
    "we determined the mean interface velocity for @xmath21 on rings of 3000 sites , using @xmath103 . after allowing the system to relax for 50@xmath104000 mcs , we record the density profile @xmath105 , and determine the interface position @xmath106 via the criterion @xmath107 , with @xmath108 the bulk particle density at the @xmath19 value of interest .",

    "expects the density to decay as a power - law , @xmath148 .",
    "at various points in this discussion we have drawn an analogy between the tcm at high diffusion rates and compact directed percolation .",
    "the picture that emerges from the simulations reported above , and from some of the earlier studies @xcite , is that in this regime the system contains essentially two kinds of regions , one of high density , the other empty .",
    "the boundaries between these regions perform independent random walks , leading eventually to extinction of activity .",
    "the above scenario corresponds to the phase transition in cdp , and suggests that we construct a reduced description in which blocks of @xmath149 sites in the active region ( with particle density on the order of @xmath150 ) correspond to sites in state 1 of the cdp , and blocks of @xmath149 empty sites correspond to sites in state 0 in the cdp .",
    "the dynamics of the cdp consists exclusively of random walks performed by the interfaces between strings of 0s and strings of 1s . as we vary @xmath19 through its critical value in the tcm , the drift velocity of the interfaces in the corresponding cdp passes through zero , and the asymptotic density of 1s jumps from zero to one .    if the above caricature of the tcm as an effective compact directed percolation model were valid , a discontinuous transition would be guaranteed .",
    "there are , however , two additional processes that must be taken into account .",
    "evidently , gaps ( strings of empty sites ) can arise within active regions , else the tcm starting from a fully occupied lattice would never reach the absorbing state .",
    "a fundamental point is that the process of gap nucleation , while essential to the tcm dynamics , occurs at an extremely small rate . by ",

    "3 permit an order of magnitude estimate of the rate of gap nucleation : the density begins to fall appreciably from its plateau value at @xmath153 , and there are @xmath154 sites in the system , giving a rate of @xmath155 per site . in fig .",
    "[ tgap ] we plot the mean first - passage time @xmath156 for the appearance of a gap of size @xmath157 in a system of @xmath158 sites ( parameters @xmath21 and @xmath116 ) , starting with all sites occupied .",
    "( in these studies @xmath156 is estimated using samples of @xmath159 50 to 500 realizations , with smaller @xmath160 for larger system sizes . )",
    "the first - passage time grows rapidly for smaller sizes and then crosses over to a slower growth around @xmath161 , at which point @xmath162 .",
    "identifying this crossover size as @xmath151 gives a nucleation rate of @xmath163 per site .",
    "it is natural to take the block size @xmath149 in the cdp mapping as the critical gap size @xmath151 , so that a one - site gap in the equivalent cdp process is equally likely to grow or to shrink to zero .",
    "since we map @xmath151 tcm sites to a single site in the cdp , the effective gap nucleation rate in the latter is then @xmath164 .",
    "the estimates for the nucleation rate and for @xmath151 given above yield @xmath165 in the range @xmath166 per cdp site .    as noted above",
    ", a small gap can shrink when particles diffuse in from outside .",
    "can a large gap be destroyed in this manner ? to answer this , consider an interface ( treated as fixed , for the sake of this argument ) between large active and empty regions : the local density @xmath167 for @xmath168 and @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "think of the edge of an active region as a particle source .",
    "particles are emitted at a rate of order @xmath171 , diffuse away at rate d , and decay at rate @xmath172 . in the stationary state ,",
    "a continuum diffusion analysis yields a local density for @xmath170 of    @xmath173    giving @xmath174 with an interface width @xmath175 . for @xmath21 and @xmath89",
    "this gives @xmath176 ; for these parameters simulation shows that near the edge of a large gap , the density decays to zero @xmath177 .",
    "nucleation of an active region inside a gap occurs at a rate @xmath178 ^ 3 $ ] , making the probability of nucleating activity deep within a gap negligible . for @xmath179 and @xmath17 and @xmath19 as above , for example , we find a nucleation rate of @xmath180 .",
    "the essential point is that @xmath120 decays exponentially , so that nucleation of activity is limited to the neighborhood of the edges , whereas the nucleation of gaps can occur anywhere inside an active region .    thus we conclude that the tcm at a high diffusion rate is equivalent to compact directed percolation with a very small , but nonzero rate of gap formation within clusters of 1s . but this process is in turn equivalent ( insofar as scaling properties are concerned ) to the domany - kinzel cellular automaton ( dkca ) @xcite with @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "( recall that in the one - dimensional dkca , @xmath183 is the probability of a site taking state 1 , given one neighbor in state 1 , and one in state 0 , at the preceding time , and that @xmath184 is the probability of state 1 given that both neighbors are in state 1 at the previous step . )",
    "cdp corresponds to the line @xmath185 . from the work of janssen @xcite and of lbeck",
    "@xcite we know that for @xmath186 , the transition occurs at @xmath187 .",
    "the phase transition of the dkca is discontinuous _ only _ for @xmath188 ; for _ any _ @xmath189 , it is continuous and belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "we are led to the same conclusion regarding the tcm : for any @xmath190 , there is a small but finite rate of nucleating gaps within active regions , so that the effective value of @xmath184 is slightly less than unity .    given the nearness of the equivalent dkca to the line @xmath188 , it is not surprising that simulations of the tcm using lattice sizes @xmath191 and simulation times @xmath192 yield an apparently discontinuous phase transition , for @xmath193",
    ". it is only for large systems and long simulation times that the effects of gap nucleation become apparent , as in the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( indeed , the results shown in fig . 3 are also compatible with dp - like decay of the order parameter . ) but numerical studies of the stationary order parameter can be expected to show discontinuous behavior , this near the cdp line . for similar reasons ,",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath2-site approximations , using clusters of fewer than twenty sites , miss the effect of gap nucleation ; much larger clusters would be needed to capture this properly .",
    "it is perhaps worth recalling that cdp - like spreading behavior is observed in a _ surface modified _ version of directed percolation in one spatial dimension @xcite . in this case ,",
    "propagation of activity at the edges of the active region occurs with a different creation rate ( @xmath194 , say ) , than in the bulk , which has a creation rate of @xmath195 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the critical creation rate for the original problem , that is , for @xmath196 .",
    "for @xmath197 , the phase transition occurs at some bulk creation rate @xmath198 , which means that the bulk has a finite activity density even for @xmath199 .",
    "thus the active cluster is compact , and the scaling behavior is that of cdp .",
    "the essential difference between this model and the tcm is that in the former case large gaps can not be nucleated within the active region : since @xmath198 at the transition , gaps tend to shrink .",
    "we have presented various pieces of evidence suggesting that the order parameter is a discontinuous function of the creation rate in the triplet creation model at high diffusion rates ( our numerical studies focus on @xmath21 ) .",
    "we do not find evidence of stable coexisting active and inactive regions ; the boundaries between these regions are observed to fluctuate , as asserted in ref .",
    "the numerical evidence in favor of a discontinuous transition includes hysteresis ( under a weak source ) , the initial - density dependence of the order parameter at later times ( with or without a particle source ) , the high particle density within active regions , the random - walk - like fluctuations of the boundaries between active and inactive regions , and the apparent absence of power - law scaling of the qs order parameter as a function of system size , at the transition point .    despite the numerical evidence in favor of a discontinuous transition , a mapping of the tcm to a effective dynamics resembling that of compact directed percolation , but with a very small gap nucleation rate , leads to the conclusion that the transition is continuous for any @xmath200 .",
    "the studies reported above , suggesting a discontinuous transition , were performed using relatively small systems and/or limited times .",
    "for example , to see the effect of gap nucleation in the studies with a weak source of activity , the source strength @xmath127 would have to be much smaller than the gap nucleation rate @xmath201 .",
    "the failure of @xmath2-site approximations to give a clear indication of the nature of the transition may again be attributed to the very small gap nucleation rate for @xmath202 .",
    "these approximations , however , are problematic even for @xmath51 : the values predicted for @xmath25 do not converge monotonically to the correct value with increasing @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the continuous nature of the transition in the one - dimensional tcm was of course asserted some time ago by hinrichsen @xcite , and received further support in park s simulations @xcite .",
    "our argument nevertheless contributes to an intuitive understanding of this result , and might provide the basis for a rigorous demonstration of the continuous nature of the transition .",
