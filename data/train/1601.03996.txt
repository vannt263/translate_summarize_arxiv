    "within the last several years there has been a wealth of papers published in this journal regarding the motion of an orbiting body on a cylindrically - symmetric surface , such as a funnel or a circular spandex fabric , residing in a uniform gravitational field . some of the interest in this topic can be attributed to fact that the orbital dynamics of an object on such a two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface offers a non - trivial and interesting application of lagrangian dynamics . with the help of a camera capable of generating short video clips and one of the aforementioned surfaces",
    ", one can easily extend this theoretical study to the experimental domain .",
    "this combined theoretical and experimental approach offers comprehensive undergraduate research possibilities as the relevant physics is accessible to any student who has taken an advanced dynamics course.@xcite    perhaps some of the interest in this topic arises from the fact that an orbiting body on a 2d surface is often used as a conceptual analogy when describing particle orbits about massive objects in general relativity . in einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) , gravity is described as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy .",
    "although in newtonian theory gravity is understood as the force of one massive object on another , in gr gravity emerges as a physical phenomenon due to the fact that a massive object warps the spacetime around it . according to gr , the planets move along geodesics , or free - particle orbits , in the non - euclidean geometry about the sun .",
    "hence , the planets move in their elliptical - like orbits aroung the sun not due to a ` force ' per se but rather due to the fact that the spacetime around the sun is curved by its presence .",
    "in a typical introductory gr course , the spacetime external to a static , spherically - symmetric massive object is often extensively studied as it offers one of the simplest , exact solutions to the field equations of gr .",
    "when geodesics about this object are then encountered , the conceptual analogy of a marble rolling on a taut elastic fabric warped by a massive compact object , such as a bowling ball , is often embraced in the discussion . when the rolling marble is far from the massive object , the elastic fabric is flat and the marble moves in a straight line at a constant speed in agreement with newton s first law .",
    "when the rolling marble approaches the massive object , as the analogy goes , it moves in a curved path not due to a force acting on the marble , but rather due to the fact that the space in which it resides ( the 2d surface ) is warped by the object .",
    "this analogy offers the student of gr a way of visualizing a warped spacetime and should not be confused with embedding diagrams.@xcite however , with this being said , it has been shown that there exists no 2d cylindrically - symmetric surface residing in a uniform gravitational field that can generate the exact newtonian orbits of planetary motion , except for the special case of circular orbits.@xcite this null result was shown to hold when considering the fully general relativistic treatment of planetary orbits around non - rotating , spherically - symmetric objects.@xcite    white and walker first explored marbles orbiting on a warped spandex surface by applying newtonian mechanics to a marble residing on a cylindrically - symmetric spandex fabric subjected to a central mass .",
    "there they arrived at an expression describing the approximate shape of the spandex surface and found that a marble orbiting upon this surface obeys the relation @xmath2 for circular orbits in the small slope regime .",
    "this fascinating result is highly reminiscent of kepler s third law for planetary motion , but with the powers transposed.@xcite lemons and lipscombe then showed that the shape of the spandex surface can equivalently be found by minimizing the total potential energy of the spandex fabric through the use of the calculus of variations .",
    "the total potential energy considered includes the elastic potential energy of the spandex surface and the gravitational potential energy of the central mass .",
    "the calculus of variations approach proves advantageous over the newtonian treatment as the results of white and walker emerge as a special case of a more general treatment , where a pre - stretch of the fabric can be included in the analysis.@xcite this work was later expanded upon by middleton and langston , where the authors considered circular orbits on the spandex fabric in _ both _ the small and large slope regimes .",
    "there they generalized the aforementioned calculus of variations treatment by including the previously - neglected gravitational potential energy of the spandex surface to the total potential energy of the spandex / central mass system .",
    "they showed that the mass of the spandex fabric interior to the orbital path influences the motion of the marble and can even dominate the orbital characteristics .",
    "they also showed that the modulus of elasticity of the spandex fabric is not constant and is itself a function of the stretch.@xcite later , nauenberg considered precessing elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities on cylindrically - symmetric funnels with various shape profiles . by employing a perturbative method , an approximate solution to the orbital equation of motion",
    "was obtained where the precession parameter was found to be determined uniquely by the slope of the cylindrically - symmetric surface.@xcite this perturbative method was then used to find the 2d surfaces that are capable of generating the stationary elliptical orbits of newtonian gravitation and the precessing elliptical - like orbits of gr , for orbits with small eccentricities.@xcite here , we re interested in understanding elliptical - like orbits of a marble on a warped spandex fabric .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ eqn ] , we first consider the motion of a rolling marble on an arbitrary , cylindrically - symmetric surface and present the orbital equation of motion . for elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities , we solve this equation of motion perturbatively and find a valid solution when the precession parameter obeys an algebraic relation involving the slope of the surface .",

    ", we compare it to its counterpart for the marble on the spandex surface in both the small and large slope regimes .",
    "we begin this manuscript by presenting the equations of motion that describe a spherical marble of uniform mass density rolling on a cylindrically - symmetric surface in a uniform gravitational field .",
    "these equations can be obtained by first constructing the lagrangian that describes a rolling marble , which is constrained to reside upon a cylindrically - symmetric surface , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "this lagrangian includes both the translational and rotational kinetic energy of the rolling marble and the gravitational potential energy of the orbiting body .",

    "this dynamical equation of motion describes the radial distance of the orbiting marble in terms of the azimuthal angle , for a given cylindrically - symmetric surface specified by @xmath7 , and equates to a non - linear differential equation that can be solved perturbatively .",
    "as here we are interested in studying elliptical - like orbits , we choose an approximate solution for the radial distance of the orbiting body to be of the form [ sol ] r()=r_0(1- ( ) ) , where @xmath9 is the eccentricity of the orbit and @xmath10 is the precession parameter . for an orbiting body",

    "the angular velocity becomes quite large and hence only a handful of particle locations are imaged ( @xmath72 ) for a given orbit ; this yields an angular separation of @xmath73 between imaged locations and gives rise to a fairly large uncertainty in the angular measurement . here",

    "in this manuscript , we arrived at expressions describing the angular separation between successive like - apsides for a marble rolling on a cylindrically - symmetric spandex surface in a uniform gravitational field in both the small and large slope regimes .",
    "we found that a minimal angular separation of @xmath0 was predicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a central mass .",

    "the addition of the cosmological constant to the field equations of general relativity can be traced back to einstein himself .",
    "one of his first applications of this new theory of gravitation , which describes gravity as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy , was to the field of cosmology .",
    "einstein added the cosmological constant to the relativistic equations only after realizing that these equations fail to offer a static cosmological solution to describe the seemingly static universe of his time .",

    "mathematically , a cosmological constant , @xmath75 , which finds itself on the curvature side of the field equations of gr , can be equivalently reformulated into a constant vacuum energy density , @xmath76 , which resides on the matter / energy side .",

    "these vacuum fluctuations give rise to a nonzero vacuum energy density .",
    "it is noted that the cosmological constant , and therefore the constant vacuum energy density , can be of either sign .",
