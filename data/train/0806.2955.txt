    "perovskite manganites show a great variety of fascinating properties such as colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect and charge - ordered insulating phase @xcite . the most interesting one is the existence of a phase - separated state , the coexistence of antiferromagnetic charge - orbital ordered ( coo ) insulating and ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal regions@xcite .",
    "several recent studies on metamagnetic transition in phase - separated manganites have revealed that ultrasharp steps in magnetization curves appear at low temperatures @xcite . to account for this ,",
    "a martensitic model due to local strain fields stored in the lattice between competing coo and fm phases with their different unit cells has been proposed though questions have been raised against this model .    for our understanding of the dynamics of a steplike first - order transition from a paramagnetic insulating ( pmi ) to a ferromagnetic metal(fmm )",

    "is observed over a wide range of temperatures@xcite .",
    "a magnetic ( @xmath7 ) phase diagram , established from magnetic measurements , is separated into three regions labeled as pmi , fmm , and bistable states , as shown in fig.1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the proximity of free energies between the pmi and fmm states is of importance to realize the bistable state where the fmm and pmi states coexist .",
    "a stronger field is needed to induce the pmi to fmm transition at low temperatures since the thermal energy is reduced upon lowering temperature .",
    "single crystals of ( la@xmath8,pr@xmath9)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath10=0.6 ) were grown by the floating zone method using a mirror furnace .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters of the tetragonal crystal structure of the crystals used here were shown in a previous report@xcite .",
    "the dimensions of the @xmath10=0.6 sample are 3.4@xmath113 mm@xmath12 in the @xmath13-plane and 1 mm along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "measurements of magnetostriction along the @xmath6-axis were done by means of a conventional strain gauge method at the tsukuba magnet laboratory , the national institute for materials science ( nims ) and at the high field laboratory for superconducting materials , institute for materials research , tohoku university . except for",

    "our findings are understood from the viewpoint that the double - exchange interaction - driven fm state is strengthened by the applied pressure .",
    "for the magnetic field cooled sample , the remarkable step observed in @xmath15 is monotonically decreased upon increasing the cooling field from 1 t up to 1.6 t , accompanied by a nonlinear dependence of @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the steplike behavior vanishes when the cooling field exceeds 1.6 t. for each field - cooled run , we expect that the fm region is initially formed within the pmi matrix before the magnetostriction measurements are carried out .",
    "a larger volume fraction of the fm phase causes a more suppressed variation in @xmath26 .",
    "thus , a pressure - induced suppression in the ultrasharp magnetostriction is a reasonable result since the applied pressure enhances the fm state .",
    "next , we carry out the magnetostriction measurement under the applied electric current , to examine a relationship between charge transport and steplike lattice deformation appeared in cmr manganites . in the case of ambient pressure , the @xmath6 axis magnetostriction data at 4.3k are presented in fig.[dli2](a ) as a function of excited current ( @xmath27=0.01 , 1 and 2 ma ) . here , the electric current is applied in the @xmath13 plane parallel to the mno@xmath4 double layers .",
    "injection of the electric current over 2 ma exhibits no discontinuous profile in @xmath15 .",
    "we note that the bath temperature is very stable against the applied current up to 2 ma within @xmath28 and joule heating of the sample affects no contribution to the present behavior .    for comparison ,",
    "let us now display in fig.[dli2](c ) the @xmath13 plane magnetoresistance @xmath24 of the @xmath25 sample as a function of the applied current from 0.1 up to 2.5 ma .",
    "first of all , the application of higher current gives rise to a degradation of the magnetoresistive steps observed at lower currents , which is almost consistent with the magnetostriction data shown in fig.[dli2](a ) .",
    "next , the zero - field resistance measured at 2 ma shows a substantial drop by @xmath29 , in comparison to @xmath24(0 ) at the lowest current ( 0.1 ma ) .",
    "this result indicates the current - induced destabilization of pmi matrix although the physical role of the application on an electric field is not clear .",
    "similar results are reported in a systematic study on nonlinear transport of a non charge - ordered manganite pr@xmath30ca@xmath31mno@xmath32 , which is not so far from the co region@xcite . in a",
    "lightly pr - substituted crystal ( la@xmath30pr@xmath31)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath33k , we also have obtained a current - induced remarkable drop in the @xmath13 plane resistance at selected temperatures just above @xmath34 .",
    "( not shown here ) the formation of short - range charge ordering in the paramagnetic phase of an optimally doped parent crystal la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 has been observed in a previous study@xcite .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the application of the electric current removes the localizes carriers , such as the coo insulating clusters , from the pmi phase of the pr - substituted crystal , causing a substantial reduction in the zero - field resistance at higher currents .",
    "furthermore , neutron scattering measurements on a bilayered manganite la@xmath35sr@xmath36mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath37 ) have revealed that the ce - type coo clusters freeze upon decreasing temperature from @xmath38k , preventing the formation of a long - range coo state @xcite .",
    "the authors have also argued that the pmi state of the crystal without pr substitution is caused by an orbital frustration and stabilized down to the fmm transition temperature @xmath39k .",
    "for the present pr - substituted sample , one believes that the short - range coo clusters accompanied by the orbital frustration are present within the pmi matrix . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we suppose that the orbital frustration has some relationship with the critical instability of the metastable state of the free energy , resulting in the steplike phase transition .",
    "the application of hydrostatic pressure stabilizes the ferromagnetic interaction within the paramagnetic matrix and the applied current reinforces an itinerant state of charge carriers within the insulating matrix . in other words",
    ", these external variables probably lead to a collapse of the ce - type antiferromagnetic charge - ordered clusters if these type clusters are distributed within the sample .",
    "in addition , mahendiran et al . have claimed that the charge - orbital ordered domains in the co - doped pr@xmath40ca@xmath40mno@xmath32 are smaller than the undoped pr@xmath41ca@xmath42mno@xmath32 , suggesting that the onset temperature of the step transitions in the co - doped compound is higher than that in the undoped one @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the distribution of short - range coo clusters embedded in the matrix provides a significant clue of our understandings of the steplike transformations in cmr manganites .",
    "the ultrasharp pmi - fmm transition induced by the magnetic field at low temperatures is in its origin quite different from the standard i m transition associated with the metamagnetic transition at higher @xmath20 .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated the influence of pressure on the steplike lattice deformation of single crystalline bilayered manganite(la@xmath0 pr@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "the external perturbations such as the application of pressure and electric current give a substantial suppression on the steplike transition , resulting in a broad change in the magnetostriction .",
    "it is a future problem to resolve what role the co clusters within the pmi phase play in the occurrence of the steplike phenomenon observed .",
