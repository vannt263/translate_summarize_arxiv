    "the latest discovery about gro  j165540 is the fact that magnetic fields are the only explanation for the launch of jets in this object by @xcite , who also use the distance of 3.2 kpc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to complement the work of @xcite , who have shown that the distance of gro  j165540 must be smaller than 1.7  kpc , but focusing on how the distance of 3.2  kpc has been determined , and to show that this value is far from being firm .",
    "other distance methods will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "@xcite first mention three references to say that gro  j165540 lies at a distance of roughly 3  kpc : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which are discussed below . then",
    ", the authors present new radio data obtained with the _ very large array _ ( vla ) and the _ very long baseline array _ ( vlba ) .",
    "the 22 epochs of _ vla _ observations ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) did not resolve the source at a level of 100 mas , but only a multi - cores object elongating with time .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use the more precise _ vlba _ observations .",
    "however , the authors emphasize clearly the lack of very - long - baseline interferometry calibrator , which implies that the data are self - calibrated , `` eliminating all absolute positional information , and leaving the alignment of the different images a free parameter . ''",
    "consequently , they must assume that the brightest point in each image is the stationary center of ejection .",
    "as mentioned in the paper , `` these [ vla ] and other [ unspecified ] data are consistent with constant intrinsic proper motion of 54 mas  d@xmath6 '' and later `` the underlying proper motions appear constant '' .",
    "this is a very likely hypothesis , although it is only an hypothesis .",
    "the authors mention that this hypothesis is strengthen by the fact that the ( supposed ) constant proper motions observed with the vla and the vlba agree .",
    "but what if this brightest point is not showing the true motion of the matter of the jets ?",
    "although very likely too , this hypothesis does not take into account the flux decays , and that the flux decay rate varies along the jet , as mentioned by the authors themselves .",
    "moreover , the authors also mention the daily southern hemisphere vlbi experiment ( sheve ) array observations of @xcite which are consistent only with the major structures . the proper motion inferred from sheve data of 65@xmath15 mas  d@xmath6 agrees with the 62 mas  d@xmath6 motion of the _ outer edge _ of the early ne ejecta .",
    "the relevance of choosing the brightest point of each vlba image could then be questioned .",
    "finally , they build a kinematic model of the radio jets of gro  j165540  based on these _ vlba _ observations .",
    "this is the method `` c '' of @xcite .",
    "they use the kinematic equation described in @xcite that link the apparent velocity of the receding and approaching radio jets ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ) , and the distance @xmath9 , the true jets velocity @xmath10 and the jet projection angle relative to the line of sight @xmath11 :    @xmath12    where @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "the problem with these relations is the number of known variables ( @xmath13 ) and the number of unknowns ( @xmath14 ) . to find a distance , @xcite had to assume a value for the projection angle : @xmath15 .",
    "but a careful reading of this paper reveals that it is the maximum value allowed by the data , i.e. an upper limit only .",
    "more precisely , the _ vla _ gives an estimation of the apparent true proper motion of the jets ( assuming the two jets are moving apart with the same velocity ) @xmath16 mas  d@xmath6 .",
    "it is then possible to rewrite the above equation as follows :    @xmath17    and solving for @xmath11 by eliminating @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath19    from the measured values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 of 54 and 45 mas  d@xmath6 respectively with the _ vlba _ data , it means that @xmath20 mas  d@xmath6 , consistent with _ vla",

    "] rewriting eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , we obtain :    @xmath23    where @xmath5 is the speed of light . consequently ,",
    "as noted by @xcite , only an upper limit to the distance can be obtained from the data : @xmath24 .    in summary ,",
    "the data allow to derive an lower limit for the proper motion , and an upper limit for the inclination angle , and the distance .",
    "quoting literally the paper of hjellming & rupen : `` for a distance of 3.2  kpc , this corresponds to @xmath25 , implying @xmath26 . ''",
    "although not clearly stated , the reason why the authors chose 3.2 kpc is that this value is right in between their upper limit , and the lower limit given by _ other _ references .",
    "as noted above , @xcite quote three other papers for a first estimation of the distance : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the first reference is quoting the two others for a distance value , and is therefore irrelevant for this issue . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite is an iau circular in which it is simply stated that `` hi observations of gro  j165540 made with the _ at compact array _ show solid absorption in the velocity range @xmath27 to @xmath28 km  s@xmath6 , with a further isolated weak feature at @xmath29 km  s@xmath6 . _",
    "the balance of probabilities is that the distance is around 3.5 kpc , unless the @xmath29 km  s@xmath6 feature is due to an atypical cloud . _ ''",
    "this circular is obviously not a measurement of the distance , and is based on the hypothesis that this feature at @xmath29 km  s@xmath6 can be correctly interpreted as a hi cloud that is moving with the mean galactic rotation .",
    "this is exactly what @xcite also do , independently .",
    "interestingly , the authors seem to _ expect _ a rather large distance in order to agree with a supposedly `` significant reddening due to absorption '' , which is quoted from another iau circular : @xcite .",
    "what this latter circular states is that : `` [ ... ] the [ optical ] spectrum exhibits prominent , broad balmer lines [ ... ] superimposed on a relatively red continuum . [ ... ] '' however , the spectrum has been taken during an active state of the object , whose characteristics were , at that time , unknown , and the reddening is not at all measured .",
    "@xcite present new _",
    "vlbi _ and _ atca _ data of gro  j165540 .",
    "their hi spectrum obtained with _ atca _ ( see their fig .  2 ) shows a multi - component profile , with weak features at @xmath28 and @xmath29  km  s@xmath6 too . attributing the absorption feature at @xmath28  km  s@xmath6 to hi clouds participating in general galactic rotation places a lower limit of 3.0 kpc on the distance . as noted by the authors , if the feature at @xmath29  km  s@xmath6 was due to galactic rotation , the implied minimum distance of gro  j165540 would be of 4.2 kpc .",
    "but it could nt be ruled out that this feature is due instead to hi driven by a @xmath30  km  s@xmath6 expanding shell or ionized material surrounding the adjacent scorpius ob1 association , at a distance of 1.9 kpc @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the minimum distance of gro  j165540 is roughly around 3.0 kpc ( obviously not providing uncertainties ) .",
    "although it looks reasonable , this assumption might simply not be true .",
    "these measurements are very dependent on the distribution and velocities of various hi clouds along the line of sight ; a difficulty that has been claimed to be important by @xcite who note that , in this direction , there are clouds with anomalous velocities up to @xmath29 km  s@xmath6 @xcite , i.e. with an amplitude similar to that of the weak feature observed in the _ atca _ spectrum .    the distance of 3.2@xmath10.2 kpc has certainly been chosen by @xcite as a reasonable value between the lower limit of 3.0 kpc given by @xcite based on a very weak assumption about moving hi clouds ( although their distance range seems to be strengthened by other quick observational reports ) , and the upper limit provided by their radio data .",
    "it is important to stress that the exact and accurate distance of gro  j165540 is still an open question . before the direct measurement by the european satellite _",
    "gaia _ , it should be possible to test the distance value using methods that have never been used so far .",
    "in particular , we want to mention a new ( and exploratory ) possibility using bisectors .",
    "first , @xcite has shown that the bluemost point of single - line bisector is an indicator of the luminosity for late - type stars .",
    "this very interesting relation is weakened by the fact that high - quality single - line bisectors require a high spectroscopic resolution , and a very high signal - to - noise ratio ( above , say , 300 ) .",
    "however , the recent study by @xcite has shown that the bisector of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) can be used as much the same way as single - line bisectors .",
    "the combination of these two results could lead to a first - order `` direct '' method of estimating the luminosity of the secondary star in gro  j165540 .",
    "given the much larger brightness of gro  j165540 in the near infrared ( nir , @xmath31 ) than in the optical ( @xmath32 ) , a ccf bisector could be obtained in a reasonable amount of time with the new near - ir echelle spectrograph on the vlt : crires , which is being commissioned at the time of writing .",
    "such investigation is already underway .",
    "this new method might also proved to be useful for many other faint and embedded stars in star - forming regions .",
    "this work has been partly made in collaboration with t.h .",
    "dall , e. depagne and i.f .",
    "this research has made extensive use of nasa s astrophysics data system , of the arxiv astro - ph , and the central bureau for astronomical telegrams of the iau ."
