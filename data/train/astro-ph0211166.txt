    "about 50 galaxies are currently known with rest - frame 11000  luminosities in excess of @xmath9 .",
    "these are the hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( hylirgs ) , of which there are estimated to be 100200 over the whole sky with @xmath10  ( rowan - robinson  2000 ; rr2000 ) .",
    "the first were discovered during follow - up of the _ iras _ mission in the late 1980s , mainly through cross - correlation with existing optical , radio or active galaxy catalogues .",
    "several have recently been identified from 850  surveys , and the first sample based on unbiased infrared surveys is that of rr2000 .    whilst the infrared emission in hylirgs is mainly thermally reprocessed dust emission , their ultimate power source  and hence their relation to other galaxy populations  has yet to be firmly established .",
    "one possibility is that they are simply high luminosity analogues of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , with @xmath11 ) , the majority of which are powered by obscured star formation , although above @xmath12  the agn - powered fraction is around 50 per cent ( as inferred from mid - infrared _ iso _ spectra : lutz et al .  1998 ; rigopoulou et al .",
    "most ulirgs reside in gas - rich interacting / merging galaxy systems , prompting a scenario in which they represent an early phase in the merger - induced formation of optically - selected quasars ( see the review by sanders & mirabel  1996 ) .",
    "a different possibility is that the hylirgs constitute a population of primeval galaxies , undergoing their first major episode of star formation at rates @xmath13 .",
    "this view was advocated by rr2000 on the basis of dust radiative transfer models of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , from which he inferred that the bulk of hylirg emission longward of 50  ( in the rest frame ) is starburst powered .",
    "further insights into the nature of the hylirgs have come recently from morphological analysis of their host galaxies and detailed sed modelling : farrah et al .",
    "( 2002a ) presented _ hst _ wfpc2 _ i _ band imaging of 9 hylirgs , three of which have interacting morphologies and six of which are qsos .",
    "the qso hosts are all extremely luminous ellipticals ( with undisturbed morphologies ) comparable to the brightest cluster ellipticals seen locally .",
    "none of the sources shows evidence for gravitational lensing , implying that their high luminosities are intrinsic .",
    "verma et al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented _ iso _",
    "7180  photometry and radiative transfer sed modelling of 4 hylirgs ; they found that three of the objects require star formation ( at rates @xmath14 ) and agn components to match their mid to far - infrared seds , whilst an agn dust torus suffices for the fourth object .",
    "this modelling was extended by farrah et al .",
    "( 2002b ) with the addition of _ scuba _ sub - mm photometry for 11 hylirgs ; they found that starburst and agn components were required in all the objects , with the starburst fraction spanning the range 2080 per cent ( with a mean of 35 per cent ) .",
    "the agn and starburst luminosities are correlated , but the trend of increasing agn fraction with luminosity does not increase beyond that found for the brightest ulirgs .",
    "x - ray observations are an important diagnostic tool for hylirgs , particularly for revealing obscured agn .",

    "since 2mass positions are very accurate with respect to the tycho 2 catalogue ( @xmath30 ; hg et al .",

    "there is known to be considerable spatial variation over the pn ccds in the internal background from fluorescent lines of al - k ( 1.4 ) and the complex of cu - k , ni - k and z - k lines at 79  ( see lumb et al .",

    "care was taken to ensure that the background region was sufficiently close to the source for this not to be a problem .",

    "an xspec model of the form zwabs(mekal ) + pexrav  ( convolved with the negligible galactic absorption of @xmath34 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) provides a good fit to the spectrum , with the parameters shown in table  1 .",
    "the thermal mekal component is probably of starburst origin , but we note , however , that the soft x - ray emission in starburst galaxies typically has a higher temperature of @xmath35  ( see e.g. iwasawa  1999 ; dahlem , weaver & heckman  1998 ) . together with the high intrinsic absorption required by this component  which could imply an implausibly high mass of absorbing material if spatially extended on scales of tens of   this raises the possibility that the soft x - ray emission could instead be an emission line complex at @xmath36  from gas photoionised by the hidden agn discussed below .",

    "iras f12514 + 1027 and f00235 + 1024 have comparable infrared dust luminosities and sed modelling suggests that a starburst and obscured quasar contribute equally to the total power of each .",
    "why then are their x - ray properties so different ?    in iras f12514 + 1027 , we see the soft x - ray emission from the starburst at approximately the expected level . in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath39 ) , the flat continuum and fe k absorption edge suggest that the emission from the active nucleus is reflection dominated , implying that the direct line of sight to the nucleus is obscured by compton - thick material . however , in order to account for the total luminosity , the x - ray reflector must subtend a solid angle @xmath5  sr at the illuminating x - ray source .",
    "this relatively large opening angle for the escape of nuclear radiation is also consistent with the seyfert 2 optical spectrum of this hylirg .    in iras",
    "f00235 + 1024 , the soft x - ray limit implies that the starburst is x - ray weak with respect to its infrared output ( by at least a few tens of per cent compared with the ` canonical ' starburst ) . in the hard x - ray band ,",
    "the direct line of sight to the active nucleus is obscured by compton - thick material ( as in f12514 + 1024 and consistent with the result from infrared sed modelling that the obscuring agn torus is seen almost edge on ; farrah et al .",
    "unlike f12514 + 1024 , however , no reflected x - ray emission is seen ; any reflector must subtend a solid angle @xmath7  sr at the illuminating source .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the starburst optical spectrum of this object if the active nucleus is obscured over a large solid angle , so that line emission from stellar photoionization dominates over that from the active nucleus .",
    "if the merger - induced evolutionary scenario is applicable , this high level of nuclear obscuration may reflect the fact that f00235 + 1024 is a youthful merger , as shown in the _ hst _ image ( farrah et al .",
    "2002a ) ; no morphological information is available for iras f12514 + 1027 for comparison .",
    "we conclude that in compton - thick quasars such as these , it is the covering factor of the central engine which determines their appearance in reflected x - rays , and the agn contribution to their optical spectra .",
    "future hard x - ray observations of an enlarged sample of narrow optical emission line hylirgs can test the generality of this conclusion .",
