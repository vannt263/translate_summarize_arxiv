    "many of the ideas presented in this paper have also appeared previously in @xcite . the intent of this article is to assemble what we view as the important points in a short and coherent summary , and to add some results concerning a relation between lee - yang zeroes and stokes phenomena .",
    "quantum field theories may be defined either by a path integral or by a set of functional differential equations which follow from the schwinger action principle @xcite ,    @xmath0    for the sake of illustration , consider a zero dimensional `` quantum field theory '' defined by the action @xmath1 .",
    "the generating functional for correlation functions of @xmath2 is    @xmath3    where it is assumed that the integral is convergent .",
    "this is a solution of the action principle equations    @xmath4    where @xmath5 are the parameters of the theory .",
    "for the specific action    @xmath6    equations and become    @xmath7    although all these equations are included in the schwinger action principle , it will be convenient to refer to equations involving variations of the fields ( e.g. , ) as schwinger - dyson equations , and those arising from variation of parameters ( e.g. , ) as action principle equations .",
    "in general the equations and have a several parameter class of solutions . for the action , the corresponding equations and have a three parameter class of solutions , which includes .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations are solved by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are inequivalent integration paths in the complex @xmath2 plane over which the integral converges and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of the coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the number of such contours matches the order of the differential equation .",
    "figure 1 shows the domains of convergence , @xmath13 , and a basis set of contours for real positive @xmath11 .",
    "figure 1 .",
    "roughly speaking , the action principle requires the coefficients @xmath10 to be independent of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "this statement is imprecise since , if @xmath11 is is taken to be complex and the argument of @xmath11 is varied sufficiently , the contours of integration @xmath14 must be changed to maintain convergence . for a general polynomial action",
    ", this statement holds for the `` top coupling '' associated with the highest power of @xmath2 in the action . for a given top coupling @xmath11",
    ", each contour @xmath9 belongs to an equivalence class of contours for which integration gives the same result .",
    "the equivalence classes ( see figure 2 ) consist of contours for which @xmath15 within the same domains of convergence ; the action is analytic in @xmath2 except at infinity .",
    "there is always a choice of contour @xmath9 within an equivalence class which can be held fixed while making infinitesimal variations of the top coupling .",
    "the action principle requires that the coefficients associated with these contours do not vary as one makes infinitesimal changes in the couplings .",
    "figure 2 . for @xmath16 , ( a )",
    "the contours @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equivalent .",
    "however for @xmath19 , ( b ) the integral over @xmath18 remains convergent while the integral over @xmath17 diverges .    to dispel doubt that the `` exotic '' solutions with complex integration contours have physical relevance ,",
    "consider the effective action for the theory defined by , with real @xmath20 and real @xmath21 .",
    "the expectation value for @xmath2 is a solution of the equation    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the one particle irreducible effective potential .",
    "the tree level effective potential ( in this case the action ) has minima at @xmath24 .",
    "the minimum @xmath25 corresponds to a solution of the schwinger - dyson equations with an integral representation involving a sum of the contours @xmath26 and @xmath27 drawn in figure 1 .",
    "these integrals have contributions only from the saddle point at @xmath28 .",
    "hence symmetry breaking vacua , whose existence is normally attributed to a thermodynamic limit , exist even in zero dimensions when the full set of solutions of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations are considered .",
    "note that no symmetry breaking term has been added to the action ; the symmetry is broken by the choice of integration path .",
    "note that the solutions associated with the contours @xmath26 and @xmath27 in figure 1 .",
    "have complex parts which do not appear at any order in a perturbative expansion about the saddle point .",
    "however , due to the linearity of the schwinger - dyson equations , one can sum the contours to get a solution for which the non - perturbative contribution is real .",
    "the reader might be concerned that the `` exotic '' solutions which are not integrals over real @xmath2 do not satisfy the axioms of euclidean quantum field theory . although one can easily arrange for the greens functions to be real",
    ", one might still worry that even greens functions are not manifestly positive .",
    "in fact one should postpone these questions for the higher dimensional case as perversities of the exotic solutions could vanish in the thermodynamic / continuum limit .",
    "in fact , we expect this to be the case , as symmetry breaking vacua and theta vacua are examples of exotic solutions .    in the subsequent section ,",
    "we argue that the appearance of phase boundaries in quantum field theories is intimately related to a collapse of the solution set in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this proposal can be made concrete in a zero dimensional analogue , for which we demonstrate a correspondence between the collapse of the solution set as a top coupling is set to zero and the accumulation of lee - yang zeros , leading to a non - analyticity in a coupling constant . in this context , the limit of a vanishing top coupling is analogous to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the complementary descriptions of phase boundaries in terms of the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes and the collapse of the solution set share a common origin in stokes phenomena .    in section 3",
    ", we prove the equivalence of borel resummation of the perturbative expansion about saddle points and exotic solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations , for various singularity avoiding contours in the borel plane .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we argue that the action principle may emerge from the schwinger - dyson equations under suitable conditions , due to the collapse of the solution set in the thermodynamic limit , rather than being an independent set of equations .",
    "when complex values of the parameters of a quantum field theory are considered , phase boundaries which appear in the thermodynamic limit can be understood in terms of the accumulation of zeroes of the partition function which pinch the real axis , known as lee - yang zeroes @xcite . as we shall explicitly demonstrate below , the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes is not confined to the thermodynamic limit . in zero dimensional polynomial theories ,",
    "lee - yang zeroes also accumulate in the limit that the top coupling @xmath29 goes to zero . in this limit , a non - analyticity in the coupling @xmath30 appears . in this context",
    ", we will propose an alternative ( and complementary ) description of the appearance of phase boundaries in terms of the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations .",
    "consider the zero dimensional action @xmath31 .",
    "there is a branch point at @xmath32 , due to the necessity of rotating the contours of integration in the integral representation , in order to maintain convergence as the argument of @xmath29 is varied .",
    "it is always possible to find a contour in an equivalence class which can be held fixed under infinitesimal variations of the top coupling ( see figure 2 ) , so as to satisfy the action principle .",
    "however large variations in the argument of the top coupling require changes in the contour .",
    "in particular , under a rotation by @xmath33 the solutions transits among @xmath34 riemann sheets .",
    "the solutions are analytic in the couplings @xmath35 for @xmath36 , except at infinity , since these couplings do not effect the domains of convergence . in the limit @xmath37 ,",
    "the solution develops a branch point in the new top coupling , @xmath30 .",
    "the limit @xmath37 is analogous to a thermodynamic limit . for the case",
    "@xmath38 we will explicitly show that this limit is accompanied by the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes in the complex @xmath30 plane .",
    "the appearance of this branch point can be understood in terms of the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations . in the limit @xmath37 , with fixed @xmath39 solutions of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations either diverge , vanish or have a finite limit .",
    "it is easy to see which by considering the overlap of the domains of convergence in the complex @xmath2 plane for the case in which @xmath29 is the top coupling or for which @xmath30 is the top coupling ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "if a convergent contour for @xmath41 is equivalent to one which lies within a single wedge of convergence for the case @xmath40 , then the integral will vanish in the @xmath42 limit with fixed @xmath39 . on the other hand",
    "if a convergent contour for @xmath41 is not equivalent to any contour lying within the wedges of convergence for @xmath32 , then the @xmath42 limit is divergent .",
    "a finite @xmath42 limit exists only if an equivalent contour lies within two different wedges of convergence for the @xmath40 case .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the various possibilities for the case @xmath43 .",
    "figure 3 . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the integral over the contour @xmath46 or the equivalent contour @xmath47 vanishes in the @xmath48 limit , while the integral over @xmath49 is finite . for @xmath44 and @xmath50",
    "the integral over @xmath51 diverges .",
    "suppose that the argument of @xmath29 is kept fixed as @xmath52 . in this limit",
    "the behavior of the partition function , defined by a particular contour of integration in the complex @xmath2 plane , will change discontinuously as the argument of @xmath30 is varied across certain critical values .",
    "for example the @xmath42 limit may go from finite to divergent upon crossing a stokes line .",
    "however it is possible to keep this limit finite by considering variations in the contour of integration which violate the action principle by terms which vanish in the @xmath37 limit . for @xmath40 ,",
    "these variations are equivalent to analytic continuation in @xmath30 .    to illustrate how this works , consider the case @xmath43 .",
    "as one varies the argument of @xmath53 keeping that of @xmath54 fixed , a generic solution of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations will become alternately divergent , finite , or vanishing in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "one can can keep the limit finite by adding contours such as @xmath46 in figure 3 when the argument of @xmath53 enters a wedge in which the contribution from this contour vanishes as @xmath55 .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the domains of convergence for @xmath56 are indicated in light gray , while the domains of convergence for @xmath57 are indicated in dark gray . starting with a solution of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations corresponding the contour @xmath26 , @xmath58",
    "is varied from @xmath59 to @xmath60 keeping @xmath61 .",
    "initially the solution is finite as @xmath48 , since the contour @xmath26 lies asymptotically within two domains of convergence for @xmath62 . at @xmath63 the contour",
    "is modified to @xmath64 .",
    "note that the integration over @xmath17 vanishes in the @xmath55 limit for a neighborhood of @xmath65 , since @xmath17 is equivalent to a contour lying within a single domain of convergence when @xmath66 .",
    "one can continue varying @xmath58 to @xmath60 without a change in the asymptotic behavior as @xmath48 ; the partition function remains finite in this limit . on the other hand , had the contour been fixed as @xmath26 , the integral would be divergent as @xmath48 for @xmath58 on the other side of the stokes line @xmath67 . for @xmath68 and @xmath66",
    ", the contour @xmath26 does not lie within the domains of convergence asymptotically , unlike the the contour @xmath27 .",
    "figure 4 . as the argument of @xmath53",
    "is varied , the contour is changed to keep the integral finite in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "considering larger variations of @xmath58 one can repeat this process to give a solution of the schwinger - dyson equations which is finite and satisfies the action principle in the @xmath55 limit . for @xmath62",
    "this process corresponds to analytic continuation in @xmath69 .",
    "the changes in contour necessary to maintain a finite @xmath48 limit ( and avoid stokes phenomena ) give rise to the third order branch point at @xmath70 .",
    "we thus arrive at the picture that non - analyticity in a coupling constant arises due to the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations . in the example we have given",
    ", non - analyticity in @xmath30 arises as the top coupling @xmath37 . in this limit , some solutions are finite , while others diverge or vanish . because the equations are linear and certain solutions vanish in this limit , various classes of solutions with inequivalent integral representations also coalesce as @xmath42 .",
    "this permits larger variations of the contour which satisfy the action principle . at the same time larger variations of the contour",
    "may become necessary to obtain a finite partition function as coupling constants are varied . while we have explicitly demonstrated this mechanism for the @xmath42 limit of a zero dimensional polynomial theory , we propose that the same phenomena hold true for the thermodynamic limit , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of degrees of freedom , in a multi - dimensional field theory .",
    "in other words , non - analyticity in a parameter of a quantum field theory should be related to the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations in the @xmath71 limit .",
    "the analogy we have proposed between a non - analyticity arising in the @xmath42 limit of a zero dimensional theory and non - analyticities arising in the thermodynamic limit is strengthened by noting that the @xmath42 limit is accompanied by the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes along stokes lines in the complex @xmath30 plane .",
    "one can explicitly see how this occurs for @xmath73 .",
    "consider the partition function    @xmath74    for positive real @xmath11 and a contour @xmath27 which goes to infinity with @xmath75 , as in figure 5 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated in terms of an airy function ;    @xmath76        figure 5 .",
    "the zeroes of @xmath77 lie along the negative real @xmath78 axis .",
    "since the argument of the airy function in is @xmath79 , zeroes of the partition function accumulate on the imaginary axis in the complex @xmath12 plane as @xmath80 , pinching the real axis at @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , @xmath82 are stokes lines .",
    "the @xmath80 behavior of @xmath83 in the neighborhood of @xmath84 can be seen by inspecting figure 6 , in which the domains of convergence for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are indicated by the lighter and darker shaded regions respectively . for @xmath87",
    ", @xmath83 diverges in the @xmath80 limit , with the leading term in a saddle point expansion given by    @xmath88    on the other side of the stokes line , @xmath89 , @xmath83 converges in the @xmath90 limit , with the leading term in a saddle point expansion given by    @xmath91        figure 6 . on either side of the stokes line at @xmath92 ,",
    "the integral is either finite ( c ) or divergent ( a ) in the @xmath80 limit .",
    "zeroes of the partition function accumulate as @xmath80 for values of @xmath12 on the stokes line ( b ) .    on the stokes line , @xmath93 , the two saddle point expansions and become comparable in magnitude as @xmath80 , since the real part of the exponential in vanishes .",
    "the integral over the contour in figure 5 is equivalent to the sum of the integrals over two constant phase ( steepest descent ) contours , @xmath94 and @xmath95 in figure 7 , which pass through classical solutions for which the real part of the action is degenerate .",
    "the accumulation of zeroes on the stokes line is related to the fact that the relative phase of the two integrals oscillates wildly with variations of @xmath12 in the @xmath80 limit , due to the factor of @xmath96 .",
    "steepest descent contours passing through the classical solutions at @xmath97 , on the stokes line @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes and the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations are complementary descriptions of the appearance of non - analyticity in a parameter of a zero dimensional theory as the top coupling @xmath42 .",
    "the two descriptions have a common origin in stokes phenomena .",
    "we conjecture that these are also complementary descriptions of non - analyticity in parameters of quantum field theories which arise in the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 . upon completion of this work",
    ", we discovered @xcite , in which lee - yang zeroes in a 1d model with a wetting transition were shown to lie along stokes lines associated with the asymptotic expansion in @xmath72 .",
    "the correspondence between stokes lines and lee - yang zeroes has also been suggested in @xcite , in the context of ising and gauge models .",
    "it is well known that the loop expansion in quantum field theory is an asymptotic rather than a convergent series .",
    "one approach to obtain non - perturbative information from the loop expansion is the borel resummation , in which a convergent series ( the borel transform ) in a variable @xmath99 is obtained from the asymptotic series in @xmath100 .",
    "the borel transform is then inverted to give a function having the correct asymptotic expansion , but which contains non - perturbative information .",
    "since there are actually an infinite number of such functions , differing by essential singularities at @xmath101 , it is a non - trivial statement that the borel transformation corresponds to the path integral . moreover , there are frequently singularities of the borel transform on the positive real @xmath99 axis , due to instantons and renormalons , which prevents an unambiguous borel resummation .    under generic conditions , the number of classical solutions is equal to the number of independent solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations . for an arbitrary polynomial action in a zero dimensions ,",
    "@xmath102    we will prove that various borel resummations of perturbative expansions about classical solutions satisfy both the schwinger - dyson equations and the action principle equations , and therefore correspond to various complexified path integrals .",
    "consider the partition function    @xmath103    where the path @xmath23 is equivalent to a steepest descent path passing through a dominant saddle point ( classical solution ) @xmath104 .",
    "the loop expansion yields a contribution to the generating function of the form ;    @xmath105    this series is asymptotic , but its borel transform defined by    @xmath106    converges to    @xmath107    where in the vicinity of @xmath108 the contour @xmath27 encloses , in the opposite sense ( see figure 8) , the two poles @xmath109 , for @xmath110 , which coalesce to @xmath111 as @xmath112 .",
    "all the other poles are taken to lie outside the contour .",
    "the borel transform has a singularity when one of the exterior poles coalesces with one of the interior poles , which occurs when @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a neighboring classical solution .",
    "doing the @xmath2 integral gives    @xmath115        figure 8 .",
    "thus far everything we have said is well known @xcite .",
    "we now exhibit an exact relation between the borel resummation and the exotic solutions of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations .",
    "we invert the borel transform by writing    @xmath116    with an as yet unspecified integration contour @xmath117 in the complex @xmath99 plane .",
    "equivalence of with a solution of the schwinger - dyson equations requires    @xmath118    where @xmath9 indicate open paths in the complex @xmath2 plane which asymptotically lie within the domains of convergence determined by the the top coupling @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath27 and @xmath119 are inequivalent , involves a non - trivial exchange in the order of integration under which contours are not preserved . instead of directly proving",

    "we set @xmath120 in what follows .",
    "if @xmath121 satisfies both the schwinger - dyson equations and the action principle then it is annihilated by the operators ;    @xmath122    and    @xmath123    it is convenient to define the quantity    @xmath124    to show that @xmath125 , for @xmath121 defined in , it suffices to show that @xmath126 where    @xmath127    before proceeding , we list several simple but useful identities . due to the equation of motion , @xmath128 ,",

    "so long as a contour @xmath117 for which @xmath145 is used , the borel resummation gives a solution of the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations .",
    "it would be very interesting to see to what extent this analysis extends to theories with non - zero dimension .",
    "the analysis is surely more difficult since , among other possible complications , there are singularities in the borel plane due to renormalons as well as finite action classical solutions ( instantons ) .",
    "the `` exotic '' solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations given by @xmath146 , where the @xmath147 are generated from classical solutions by borel resummation , may in some sense be thought of as a generalized form of theta vacua , in which the @xmath10 play the role of theta parameters . in the usual approach a particular theta vacuum",
    "is selected by adjusting a surface term in the action and integrating over real fields .",
    "the surface term term effects the schwinger - dyson equations only at the space - time boundary , so in the infinite volume limit its role is only to set a boundary condition .",
    "it does this by putting a different weight on the contributions to @xmath83 coming from perturbative expansions about different classical solutions .",
    "we conjecture that when appropriately resummed , this is equivalent to a weighted sums over complexified path integrals .",
    "so far we have treated the schwinger - dyson and action principle equations as independent .",
    "this is certainly true for a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "if the action principle is not imposed , the manner in which a solution of the schwinger - dyson equations changes as one varies a coupling is un - determined , as the there is a continuous set of solutions to the schwinger - dyson equations for any value of the coupling .",
    "however , with certain assumptions , the action principle arises due to the collapse of the solution set of the schwinger - dyson equations in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "<S> the path integral by which quantum field theories are defined is a particular solution of a set of functional differential equations arising from the schwinger action principle . </S>",
    "<S> in fact these equations have a multitude of additional solutions which are described by integrals over a complexified path . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss properties of the additional solutions which , although generally disregarded , may be physical with known examples including spontaneous symmetry breaking and theta vacua . we show that a consideration of the full set of solutions yields a description of phase transitions in quantum field theories which complements the usual description in terms of the accumulation of lee - yang zeroes . in particular we argue that non - analyticity due to the accumulation of lee - yang zeros is related to stokes phenomena and the collapse of the solution set in various limits including but not restricted to , the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> a precise demonstration of this relation is given in terms of a zero dimensional model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for zero dimensional polynomial actions , we prove that borel resummation of perturbative expansions , with several choices of singularity avoiding contours in the complex borel plane , yield inequivalent solutions of the action principle equations .    </S>",
