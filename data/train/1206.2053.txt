    "the manganite perovskite la@xmath6(ca , sr)@xmath7mno@xmath8 exhibits a rich phase diagram of unusual electronic and magnetic properties . most prominent is the so - called colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) effect which occurs at @xmath9 in the context of a transition from a paramagnetic and insulating or poorly conducting state to a ferromagnetic and half metallic state @xcite . at",
    "somewhat lower doping at @xmath10 , the corresponding transition leads into a ferromagnetic insulating ( fi ) state which is a consequence of charge localization below the spin - polaron mobility edge and orbital ordering at low @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this fi state can also be achieved in off stoichiometric lamno@xmath3 in which the hole doping is due to la or mn vacancies .",
    "while half - metallic manganites are considered as promising spin - polarizers @xcite , the fi manganite can be an ideal spin - filter material for use in tunnel barriers with low leakage currents .",
    "efficient spin - filters are on demand for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "spin polarization depends on many parameters including the density of states ( dos ) of electronic bands @xcite , orbital hybridization and various material issues at interfaces and on the bias voltage @xcite .",
    "metallic ferromagnets provide only modest spin polarization because both majority ( @xmath12 ) and minority ( @xmath13 ) spin bands are crossing the fermi level @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this problem is obviated in insulating and half - metallic ferromagnets with separated majority and minority bands at @xmath14 , which , therefore , can facilitate an almost complete spin - polarization @xcite .",
    "the antagonism between superconductivity ( s ) and ferromagnetism ( f ) leads to a variety of novel effects in hybrid s / f heterostructures @xcite , such as the stabilization of unconventional spin - triplet superconductivity @xcite , or the realization of @xmath15-josephson junctions @xcite , that are interesting both from fundamental and applied points of view .",
    "electrons in a material , in contact with a superconductor , inherit phase coherence from the s - side , a phenomenon known as the superconducting proximity effect . in clean normal metals ( n )",
    "the proximity effect can extend over a length scale on the order of micrometers .",
    "in ferromagnetic metals the range depends on the superconducting pairing symmetry @xcite : the conventional spin - singlet pairing is rapidly suppressed by the magnetic exchange field at the scale of @xmath16 nm @xcite , but the unconventional spin - triplet pairing is immune to the magnetic exchange field and the range is similar as in non - magnetic metals",
    ". therefore long - range superconducting proximity effects , observed in ferromagnetic metals @xcite and half - metals @xcite are taken as evidence for a spin - triplet superconducting state induced via spin - active s / f interfaces @xcite .",
    "s / fi / s tunnel junctions are characterized by a non - trivial phase dynamics @xcite that is useful for phase - coherent quantum spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "atomically thin fi layers enable sizeable and almost fully spin - polarized tunnel currents that are beneficial for spintronic applications @xcite . however , the superconducting wave function and the tunneling probability decay exponentially at the atomic scale with increasing fi thickness @xcite .",
    "thus , nm - thick insulators are impenetrable for electrons due to the bandgap at the fermi level @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , generally the superconducting proximity effect is not expected in insulators and particularly not in ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the situation may change in the presence of strong electric fields or under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "for example , it is well known that a field @xmath17 v / m can change the doping state of semiconductors via ionization , or breaking of electronic bonds , leading respectively to an avalanche , or zener breakdown in p - n junctions .",
    "a variety of electric field effects has been reported in polarizable complex oxides @xcite , including cuprates @xcite and manganites @xcite . in polar media",
    "the electric field can lead not only to charge transfer but also to structural changes @xcite and electromigration , which cause resistive switching phenomena @xcite . in fi",
    "manganites the electric field may depin immobile polarons , leading to a non - linear electrical response at large bias voltage @xcite .",
    "the non - linear response at large bias is also inherent for tunnel junctions with a thick insulating barrier .",
    "the electric field leads to a linear distortion of the tunnel barrier and facilitates fowler - nordheim type tunneling ( field emission ) @xcite of hot electrons into the conduction band of the insulator .",
    "such non - equilibrium electrons in the conduction band are mobile and in case of a fi are fully spin - polarized , which may lead to a significant change of magnetoresistance ( mr ) effects @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the bias dependence of the perpendicular magneto - tunneling characteristics of epitaxially grown nano - scale s / fi / s junctions made of the cuprate superconductor yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) and the low - doped manganite lamno@xmath3 ( lmo ) that is a ferromagnetic insulator below @xmath18 k. it is observed that at low bias voltage the electron transport through the junctions is blocked due to the presence of the insulating band gap ( polaronic mobility edge ) and the lack of direct tunneling through the 20 nm thick lmo layer .",
    "however , at larger bias , @xmath19 v , corresponding to the regime of fowler - nordheim tunneling into the conduction band of the insulator , excess current through the junction appears .",
    "initially it increases gradually with increasing bias voltage but at @xmath4 v it jumps abruptly , leading to a step - like anomaly in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "such step - like increase of the excess current exists only in the superconducting state and is easily suppressed by a magnetic field .",
    "the phenomenon is attributed to a novel type of the superconducting proximity effect of non - equilibrium electrons in the conduction band of the ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the occurrence of this strongly non - equilibrium state in the lmo layer is confirmed by the direct detection of photon emission .",
    "since the conduction band in our ferromagnetic insulator is fully spin polarized , the long - range ( 20 nm ) of the observed proximity effect points towards an unconventional spin - triplet superconducting state .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the fabrication procedure of the ybco / lmo heterostructures and the nano - scale ybco / lmo / ybco tunnel junctions .",
    "we demonstrate the reproducibility of the ferromagnetic and insulating properties of lmo layers both for a single layer and within ybco / lmo multilayers with different layer thicknesses . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the perpendicular transport properties of the lmo layer in our junctions .",
    "it is shown that it undergoes a transition to the ferromagnetic insulator state at @xmath18 k with a strongly bias - dependent cmr up to -600@xmath20 . in sec .",
    "iv we report the observation of a high - bias anomaly in the junction characteristics , we demonstrate the occurrence of a fowler - nordheim tunneling into the conduction band of the fi and we provide an interpretation of the anomaly in terms of a novel type of superconducting proximity effect of non - equilibrium electrons in the conduction band of the ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the presence of a strongly non - equilibrium electron and hole population in the conduction and valence bands of the fi is confirmed by the direct detection of photon emission from our junctions at large bias .",
    "finally we argue that the long range of the proximity effect through the fi indicates the unusual odd - spin - triplet nature of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "we also argue that the fowler - nordheim tunneling in the fi should lead to perfectly spin - polarized currents that are beneficial for spintronic applications .",
    "the ybco / lmo heterostructures were deposited by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) on ( 001)-oriented sr@xmath21la@xmath22al@xmath23ta@xmath24o@xmath1 ( lsat ) substrates similar as described in refs .",
    "the substrate temperature was @xmath25 , the o@xmath0 partial pressure 0.32 mbar and the fluency and pulse frequency of the krf 248 nm excimer laser were 2 j/@xmath26 and 2 hz , respectively .",
    "the growth dynamics was monitored with in - situ reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) to ensure a 2-dimensional growth mode with sharp interfaces between the individual layers .",
    "after the growth the sample was cooled to @xmath27 at @xmath28/min where the oxygen pressure was increased to 1 bar .",
    "subsequently , the sample was further cooled to @xmath29 at a rate of @xmath30/min where it was annealed for one hour before it was cooled to room temperature .",
    "finally , the structures were covered by a protective gold layer ( 70 nm ) .    for comparison",
    ", we also grew single lmo layers on lsat substrates .",
    "it is well known that the electronic and magnetic properties of these lmo films can be largely varied depending on the pld growth conditions @xcite .",
    "we studied extensively how these can be changed in a systematic way from an insulating and antiferromagnetic or glassy magnetic state , over an insulating ferromagnetic state to a metallic ferromagnetic state with a modification of the o@xmath0 background gas pressure during pld growth and a subsequent post - annealing treatment in flowing oxygen or argon .",
    "this study , which will be presented in full length in a forthcoming publication , has established that the above mentioned growth conditions ( an o@xmath0 background pressure of 0.32 mbar and post - annealing in flowing o@xmath0 at @xmath29 ) yield lmo layers that are insulating and strongly ferromagnetic with a ferromagnetic moment of about 3 @xmath31 per mn atom .",
    "the post - annealing treatment does not strongly affect the fi properties of the lmo layer but is required to fully oxygenate the ybco layers as to achieve a sharp superconducting transition with a high critical temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the films were investigated with in - plane four - probe electric transport and magnetization measurements with a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms qd6000 ) with a vsm option . to measure the high resistance of the single layer lmo films we used an external keithley multimeter .",
    "the ellipsometry measurements were performed with a commercial rotating analyzer setup ( woollam vase ) in the range 0.5 - 6.5 ev and with a homebuilt one at 0.01 - 0.5 ev @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( b ) as well as from the optical spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( c ) .",
    "the latter show a characteristic redistribution of spectral weight below @xmath34 from high energies above 2 ev towards two low energy bands that are peaked around 1.3 ev and 0.7 ev , respectively .",
    "a similar trend was previously reported for la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath1 in the ferromagnetic insulating state @xcite where the low - energy band was assigned to the response of strongly pinned polarons of orbital and/or magnetic origin @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra and the resistivity data confirm that these polarons are strongly pinned and therefore do not contribute to a coherent charge transport . as shown in the inset ,",
    "the peaks at low frequency are entirely due to infrared - active phonon modes .",
    "this is different from the ferromagnetic , metallic state of la@xmath37(ca , sr)@xmath38mno@xmath1 for which the spectral weight transfer from high to low energy gives rise to a pronounced drude - like peak in the optical conductivity .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( d - f ) demonstrate the reproducibility of the characteristics of ybco / lmo multilayers with different number of thin ( 10 nm ) layers .",
    "it is seen that the thin lmo layers maintain their insulating ferromagnetic properties even if they are combined with ybco in the form of ybco / lmo multilayers .",

    "[ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( e ) shows the corresponding @xmath11-dependence of the in - plane resistance for the unpatterned ybco / lmo / ybco trilayer .",

    "the resistance exhibits a linear @xmath11-dependence in the normal state and a sharp superconducting transition around @xmath40 k that is characteristic of the response of optimally doped ybco",
    ". however , direct evidence that the lmo layers maintain their insulating properties in these ybco / lmo multilayers has been obtained from the optical conductivity of a corresponding [ ybco ( 10 nm ) / lmo ( 10nm)]x10 superlattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( f ) .",

    "the growth of the ybco / lmo / ybco ( 100/20/100 nm ) heterostructure , covered by a protective au layer ( 70 nm ) , was described in the previous sec .",

    "there are singularities in the dos at the superconducting gap energy of @xmath96 mev @xcite .",
    "the electronic bands in lmo are spin - polarized and are separated by the band gap ( the polaronic mobility edge ) @xmath97 ev , corresponding to half the optical gap in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1_lmo ]  ( f ) , followed by maxima in the dos at @xmath98 ev @xcite .",
    "the electric field is concentrated in the fi layer , which leads to the linear gradient of the electric potential , that is shown by the dotted lines .",
    "regime - a : at low bias , @xmath99 v , electrons have to tunnel through the full thickness of the lmo layer .",
    "the probability of such a direct tunneling process is negligible due to the large thickness of the lmo layer ( 20 nm ) .",
    "this leads to the blocking of the tunnel current at @xmath100 v that is seen from the @xmath83 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( e ) and ( f ) and the @xmath56-@xmath57 curve in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( a ) ( regime - a ) .",
    "regime - b : at intermediate bias , 0.3 v @xmath101 v , a fowler - nordheim type tunneling of electrons into the conduction band and holes into the valence band of the insulator becomes possible , as indicated by the two horizontal arrows ( for electrons and holes ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the reduction of the effective barrier thickness leads to a rapid increase of the tunnel current at @xmath102 v. fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( b ) represents the fowler - nordheim plot @xmath103 vs. @xmath104 for @xmath56-@xmath57 s at different in - plane fields at @xmath105 k. the broad straight parts are characteristic of the fowler - nordheim tunneling through the triangular barrier @xcite .",
    "the slope of the curves depends on the barrier height @xmath106 .",
    "it is seen that it does not change with field , which is also seen from the field - independence of the threshold voltages for @xmath83 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( f ) .",
    "regime - c : at @xmath95 v a step in @xmath56-@xmath57 occurs .",
    "since it does not return back at higher bias , the excess current is present at all bias voltages above the step .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( c ) represents our interpretation of the unusual excess - current step .",
    "we assume that with increasing bias the fowler - nordheim tunneling leads to an enhancement of the non - equilibrium population of mobile electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band of lmo ( beyond the polaronic mobility edge ) .",
    "since the penetration of the superconducting wave function through the now much thinner triangular barrier is significant , such electrons acquire phase coherence with the ybco electrodes via the proximity effect .",
    "this leads to a drop of the resistivity in the populated part of lmo , which in turn leads to a distortion of the electric potential , as shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( c ) .",
    "the electric field becomes small in the proximity - induced ( central ) part of the lmo , co - aligned with the superconducting gap singularities of ybco electrodes . to maintain the bias voltage",
    ", the electric field has to increase in the vicinity of the interfaces , which leads to a further shrinkage of the tunnel barrier and to an even larger increase of the current into the conduction band .",
    "such a positive feedback leads to an instability , which shows up as a step in the @xmath56-@xmath57 curve .",
    "it should be mentioned that a similar step - like change of @xmath56-@xmath57 curves at large bias has been reported for single manganite films and was attributed to either depinning of polarons @xcite , or an acute joule heating @xcite .",
    "joule heating can indeed cause artifacts in large area films due to large currents and dissipation powers .",
    "however , the step in @xmath56-@xmath57 curves of our sub - micron junctions is not caused by self - heating .",
    "in general , self - heating becomes less significant in smaller structures , ( approximately linear with size ) @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( b ) it is seen that the power at the step is @xmath107 mw , which together with a realistic thermal resistance @xmath108 k / w , gives a modest heating of only several k. most clearly , this is seen from the connection between the step amplitude @xmath109 and superconducting @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( d ) .",
    "if heating would be significantly higher , the step would vanish at correspondingly lower temperature with respect to @xmath32 .     at @xmath110",
    "k and @xmath48 . ( a ) the @xmath56-@xmath57 of the generator junction @xmath58 .",
    "( b ) the signal of the detector junction .",
    "appearance of a significant photon emission above the polaronic mobility edge in lmo ( dashed line ) and resonant enhancement of emission at the step ( solid line ) are seen.,width=268 ]    the polaron depinning mechanism of high - bias instability in lmo @xcite can be relevant , provided that by the depinning one means that electrons become mobile if they are lifted by the energy @xmath106 above @xmath14 , which is equivalent to our discussion in terms of the conduction band in lmo . this scenario is not directly related to superconductivity .",
    "indeed , the reminiscence of the step at @xmath4 v can be seen even at @xmath63 k @xmath111 in mr at @xmath64 t in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ]  ( b ) .",
    "however , in our case a well defined step in the @xmath56-@xmath57 s is observed only in the superconducting state .",
    "we thus conclude that the new type of the superconducting proximity effect in the conduction and valence bands of the ferromagnetic insulator greatly amplify the phenomenon .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed suppression of the step by a modest in - plane magnetic field of @xmath112 t in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( c ) .",
    "this field is much smaller than the in - plane @xmath75 and does not significantly affect superconductivity in the ybco electrodes @xcite .",
    "however it is sufficient for suppression of the weak , proximity induced phase coherence in the lmo layer , similar as observed for the conventional proximity effect in s / n multilayers @xcite .",
    "the proposed scenario suggests the presence of a strongly non - equilibrium electron and hole population in the conduction and valence bands of lmo , respectively .",
    "the subsequent electron - hole recombination should be accompanied by an inelastic emission of bosons with an energy of @xmath113 ev , as indicated by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( c ) .",
    "the occurrence of photon @xcite or phonon @xcite emission upon inelastic tunneling is a well known phenomenon . to check the presence of the emission",
    ", we employed another junction on the same chip as a radiation detector .",
    "this detector junction was physically separated and electrically disconnected from the generator junction to ensure that only photons , propagating through the open space , can be detected .",
    "the generator junction was biased with a slowly sweeping dc - voltage and a superimposed small ac - modulation .",
    "the latter plays the role of a chopper and modulates the radiation power at the detector .",
    "the detector junction was biased at a constant dc - voltage of 0.5 v , slightly above the polaronic mobility edge .",
    "the detection occurs via photon assisted tunneling : absorbed photons create non - equilibrium hot electrons and cause excess current through the detector junction .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ]  ( b ) shows the absolute value of the first harmonics ( chopper ) signal from the detector as a function of the dc - voltage at the generator .",
    "it is clearly seen that the emission starts above the polaronic mobility edge in lmo at @xmath114 v ( dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) . at the step a pronounced emission enhancement takes place , as marked by the solid arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . since relaxation of non - equilibrium quasiparticles in a superconductor",
    "is typically accompanied by the generation of phonons , rather than photons @xcite , the observation of a significant photon emission supports our interpretation that inelastic processes are taking place in the lmo layer .",
    "to conclude , we have studied small all - perovskite s / fi / s tunnel junctions made from epitaxially grown ybco / lmo / ybco heterostructures by 3d - nanosculpturing .",
    "we observed a step - like enhancement of the current through the junction at a high bias of @xmath4 v that was ascribed to a new type of superconducting proximity effect due to non - equilibrium electrons / holes that are injected in the conduction / valence bands of the ferromagnetic insulator via the fowler - nordheim tunneling .",
    "since lmo is a fi with strongly spin polarized conduction ( minority ) and valence ( majority ) bands , the observed long - range proximity effect across the 20 nm thick lmo layer , is indicative of an unconventional spin - triplet component of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "such a long - range proximity effect through a 20 nm thick fi layer is certainly not expected for the conventional spin - singlet sc order parameter of the cuprate high @xmath87 superconductors . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the transformation to a so - called odd - frequency spin - triplet order parameter requires a spin - active interface with a non - collinear magnetic order .",
    "a modulation of the ferromagnetic order at the ybco / manganite interface has indeed been reported in refs . @xcite and may trigger such a transformation .",
    "the suggestion of a spin - triplet nature of the observed long - range proximity effect in our insulating lmo is in accord with similar reports for half - metallic manganites @xcite .",
    "the fowler - nordheim tunneling through the conduction / valence bands of the fi should be fully spin - polarized .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that such ybco / lmo / ybco junctions may act as ideal spin - filter devices for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "interestingly , spin segregation should occur in the structure . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( a ) , @xmath12-electrons should be accumulated in both ybco films ( only @xmath13-electrons leave the left ybco and only @xmath12-electrons arrive to the right ybco electrode ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath13-electrons are accumulated in lmo .",
    "the observation of resonant enhancement of light emission at the step in the @xmath56-@xmath57 at @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( b ) , is consistent with similar reports in superconductor / semiconductor / superconductor light emitting diodes @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of light emission can be attributed either to pair - wise electron - hole recombination in the presence of cooper pairing @xcite , or to establishment of josephson - like phase coherence across the structure upon emission of the photon satisfying the ac - josephson relation , which may even lead to lasing at high bias @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the practical applications of complex oxides is often hindered by various materials issues . in this respect",
    "it is important to emphasize a very good stability of our samples .",
    "no visible deterioration was detected over a one year period at atmospheric conditions .",
    "this indicates a very good crystalline and chemical matching between ybco and lmo , which facilitates the fabrication of high - quality epitaxial heterostructures for the use in fully spin - polarized spintronic components .",
