    "the neutron background estimation methods laid out in sections  [ sensitivity ] , [ resonance ] and [ natcarbon ] neglect the difference between the primary neutron energy @xmath7 ( before the scattering ) , the scattering energy @xmath8 ( sampled in the simulations ) and the reconstructed energy @xmath9 .",
    "hence , throughout these sections the notation @xmath8 will be used as the universal one for the neutron energy .",

    "furthermore , the reader s attention may be drawn to noticeable fluctuations apparent in multiple figures presented throughout this paper . with the exception of clearly recognizable resonances in the displayed spectra , the fluctuations are purely statistical in nature  a simple consequence of a finite runtime dedicated to the computationally intensive simulations .",

    "this is precisely because the estimated background is expressed in terms of the primary neutron energy instead of the reconstructed energy , thus missing the time delays following the neutron scattering off the sample . since the background overestimation seems to be more pronounced for strong resonances , subtracting the neutron background estimated from the neutron detection efficiency may significantly affect the measured capture resonances",

    "[ fig2 ] , the neutron background estimated from the neutron sensitivity of the experimental setup exhibits strong resonances due to the elastic scattering cross section of a given sample .",

    "we discuss the correct method of estimating the neutron background , focusing on the illustrative example of the strong 15.3  kev resonance in the @xmath4ni(@xmath35 ) reaction .",

    "we assume that the capture yield @xmath36 under the resonance is determined by its radiative width @xmath37 : @xmath38 .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) is due to the following reasons : ( 1 )  in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the maximum detection efficiency was used instead of the average one ( which , in fact , lowers the estimated value ) ; ( 2 )  in small part because the neutron sensitivity was calculated assuming an isotropic distribution of scattered neutrons ( isotropic in laboratory frame ) , instead of a more realistic one ; ( 3 )  most importantly , the elastic scattering cross section has a different shape than the neutron capture cross section , showing pronounced interference patterns and more extended resonance tails , strongly affecting not only the partial contribution to the yield of scattered neutrons within the limited energy range between 14  kev to 17  kev , but also the proportionality between the overall scattering yield and the neutron width , relative to the capture counterparts ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "these simple considerations already indicate that a simplified approach , such as the one of eq .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] compares the total neutron background in that region with the energy spectrum of primary neutrons that have generated it .",
    "neutrons all the way up to 10  mev contribute notably to the background below 100  kev , while the contribution from neutrons of higher energy is negligible .",

    "simultaneously , the neutrons of primary energy from the considered range produce a background mostly contained at lower reconstructed energies , down to 0.1  ev .",
    "only a small fraction of the background remains in the same energy range ( in particular , only 15% , as the ratio between previously quoted values of 3.6% and 24% ) . from both figures , together with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we reach the following conclusion : contrary to the past assumption , not even the prompt component of the neutron background under the capture resonances may be safely estimated from neutron sensitivity considerations alone . instead , complete simulations of the neutron propagation throughout the experimental hall",
    "must be performed , taking the full temporal evolution of the neutron - induced reactions into account .",
    "another common method used for estimating the neutron background  without relying on simulations , except for possible higher order corrections  consists in scaling the neutron background measured with a neutron scatterer , such as a sample of natural carbon .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that the measured background is proportional to the yield of elastically scattered neutrons for a given sample : @xmath53 , with the constant of proportionality assumed to be equal for both the scatterer and the sample under investigation . under such assumptions",

    "though , in principle , an excellent agreement outside the resonant region may not be _ a priori _ expected , it may be understood from the fact that the sources of the neutron background other than the sample itself ( i.e. the experimental components and the walls of the experimental area ) are equal for both samples .    if figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig8 ] have shown anything , it is that in estimating the neutron background directly from the elastic scattering cross section , it is by far more appropriate to use the smoothed modification of the cross section , in which the ( strong ) scattering resonances have been flattened and replaced by the smooth sections connecting to the cross section at surrounding energies .    unfortunately , fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] may betray an overly optimistic picture , since for estimating the neutron background of @xmath4ni , the simulated neutron background of @xmath59c was used , instead of the experimental one .",
    "the reason is that the measured carbon data from experimental area  1 of the n_tof facility reveal the pure neutron background only at the reconstructed energies above 1  kev @xcite . below this energy",
    "the measurements are strongly affected by the detection of @xmath60 rays from the decay of radioactive @xmath5b residuals produced by the inelastic @xmath5c(@xmath6)@xmath5b reaction @xcite , opening above the reaction threshold of 13.6  mev .",
    "this is an intrinsic feature of @xmath5c itself and can not be projected to the other samples .",
    "for this reason , in experimental area  1 the neutron background for @xmath4ni ( or any other sample ) can not be estimated in the energy range below 1  kev directly from the measured carbon data . at the same time ,",
    "any reliable extrapolation toward lower energies is extremely hard , especially since the shape of the background below 10  ev decidedly departs from the one set above 1  kev .",

    "the most important feature of the improved approach is that the neutron background is calculated from the time delays @xmath62 , and expressed as a function of the reconstructed energy @xmath9 , instead of the initially sampled energy @xmath8 .",

    "( [ estimate ] )  comparing it against the background obtained by the new technique from section  [ novel ] .",
    "the superiority of the new technique in reconstructing the portion of the background caused by the neutron scattering is clearly evident .",
    "note that in the energy range above several hundred kev the angular distribution of elastically scattered neutrons from @xmath90u departs from isotropy @xcite . while the dedicated simulations properly account for the angular distribution of the scattered neutrons , the new technique at its basic level explicitly assumes isotropic scattering in the neutron - nucleus center of mass frame , leading to a more pronounced discrepancy between the true and the estimated background",
    "however , the correction for the realistic angular distribution may be introduced directly through the angular correction factor @xmath75 . assuming the angular distribution @xmath91 of neutrons scattered in the center of mass frame to be known and normalized to unity ( with @xmath92 as the neutron scattering angle in the neutron - nucleus center of mass frame ) ,",
    "the angular correction factor simply becomes :    @xmath93    thus accommodating even the most general form of the angular distribution .",
    "of course , @xmath94 needs to be treated here as a function of @xmath73 , which is achieved directly by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) from [ considerations ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the neutron background for @xmath90u is dominated by an additional component caused by the radioactive decay of short - lived fission products ( together with the fission neutrons further enhancing the neutron background ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the gravity of this issue is strongly related to the length of the particular neutron flight - path ( @xmath3185  m for experimental area 1 at n_tof ) , which determines the time - energy correlation @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the only way to correctly estimate the background is by means of dedicated simulations , taking into account the full framework of the known neutron reactions induced both within and without the sample , and closely following their complete temporal evolution . nevertheless , the newly proposed method from section  [ novel ] may still be used for a fast and reliable estimation of the neutron background originating exclusively from elastic neutron scattering off the sample .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have performed a close investigation of the relationship between the neutron background in neutron capture measurements and the neutron sensitivity related to the experimental setup .",
    "the neutron background for a @xmath4ni sample was used in order to illustrate the difficulties in estimating the neutron background from neutron sensitivity considerations , i.e. from the neutron detection efficiency related to the experimental setup . as opposed to the neutron sensitivity being a function of the primary neutron energy ,",
    "the neutron background is a function of the reconstructed neutron energy , which is affected by the temporal evolution of the neutron - induced reactions . as a consequence",
    ", the neutron background may be overestimated under the capture resonances when the estimation is attempted on a basis of the neutron sensitivity , or even on a basis of the surrogate measurements with the neutron scatterer of natural carbon .",
    "the reason is that correlations between the primary neutron energy and the reconstructed energies are neglected in considerations based only on the neutron sensitivity . outside the resonance region",
    "a good agreement is found between the true neutron background and the background estimated from the neutron detection efficiency related to the experimental setup , and from the neutron background for natural carbon ( we remind that in the experimental area 1 of the n_tof facility the pure neutron background for the carbon sample is experimentally available only above 1 kev ) .",
    "therefore , these methods may still be used , provided that a smoothed elastic scattering cross section is used , instead of the resonant one .",
    "an improved neutron background estimation technique was presented , relying on the calculation of the neutron sensitivity as a function of the reconstructed neutron energy .",
    "supplemented by an advanced data analysis procedure , taking into account the fully relativistic kinematics of the neutron scattering , the proposed procedure yields excellent agreement between the true and the estimated neutron backgrounds for @xmath4ni and @xmath59c .",
    "the above considerations apply only to the background caused by elastically scattered neutrons . in the presence of reactions leading to the production of short - lived radioactive nuclides within the sample itself",
    ", an additional background component may be present .",
    "this has been illustrated in the case of the @xmath90u sample , for which neutron - induced fission at primary neutron energies above 600  kev translates into a strong background component at reconstructed neutron energies in the thermal and epithermal region , through the detection of radioactive residuals produced by fission .",
    "the same case can also be made for the carbon sample measured in the experimental area 1 of the n_tof facility , if one considers the @xmath5c(@xmath6)@xmath5b reaction as interfering with the neutron background measurements . in all these cases  particularly , in measurements of capture cross sections of actinides  the only way of properly estimating the total neutron - induced background is by means of detailed monte carlo simulations .",
