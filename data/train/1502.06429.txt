    "their number is , however , very small compared to that of `` allowed '' confgurations and they will therefore only slightly alter the outcome of dissipative dynamics of the system .    under these assumptions ,",
    "let us show in which conditions the mean value @xmath244 factorizes at lowest order .",
    "focusing on the dissipative part of bloch equations for @xmath245 and @xmath246 ( note that for the latter , there is no extra dephasing ) we get @xmath247 and recalling that @xmath225 , we get @xmath248 whence , for a short time interval @xmath249    when there are @xmath250 rydberg excitations in the sample , with @xmath251 ( @xmath152 is the maximum number of rydberg excitations the sample can contain ) , one has @xmath252 whence @xmath253\\left\\langle c^{\\dagger}c\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] and for @xmath98 @xmath254 so , from the point of view of @xmath255 , everything works as if the system was radiatively damped with the rate @xmath94 . in the same conditions , we moreover have @xmath256 and again , from the point of view of @xmath131 , everything works as if the system was radiatively damped with the rate @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , since all other dynamical equations ( for population , coherence and field operator mean values ) remain formally the same as in the purely radiative damping , the factorization procedure remains valid for @xmath52 provided that @xmath98 and the radiative coherence decay @xmath9 is effectively replaced by the dephasing decay rate @xmath94 ."
