    "however , further studies have shown that the transient source continues to vary in brightness well after the initial frb  150418 burst detection , and can be explained by a scintillating , low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g. @xcite ) , which leaves limited grounds to claim an unambiguous association with frb  150418 .",

    "the puppi data were coherently dedispersed to a @xmath82 , as previously done by @xcite .",

    "the data were first subbanded to @xmath87 lower time and frequency resolution and were then dedispersed using prepsubband to trial dms between @xmath88@xmath89 in order to search for pulses that peak in signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) at the expected dm of frb  121102 .",
    "this is required to separate astrophysical bursts from radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . for each candidate",
    "burst found using single_pulse_search.py ( and grouping common events across dm trials ) , the astrophysical nature was confirmed by producing a frequency versus time diagram to show that the signal is ( relatively ) broadband compared to the narrow - band rfi signals that can sometimes masquerade as dispersed pulses .",
    "evn data were acquired in real time using the e - evn setup , in which the data are transferred to the central processing center at jive via high - speed fibre networks and correlated using the sfxc software correlator .",
    "the high data rate of vlbi observations requires visibilities to be typically averaged to 2-s intervals during correlation , which is sufficient to study persistent compact sources near the correlation phase center , like the persistent radio counterpart to frb  121102 .",
    "however , we also buffered the baseband evn data to produce high - time - resolution correlations afterwards for specific times when bursts have been identified in the arecibo single - dish data .",
    "we used j0529 + 3209 as phase calibrator in all sessions ( @xmath90 away from frb  121102 ) . in the first five sessions ( conducted in feb and may ) we scheduled phase referencing cycles of 8  min on the target and 1  min on the phase calibrator .",
    "whereas this setup maximized the on - source time for burst searches , it provided less accurate astrometry due to poorer phase solutions .",
    "the pulsar b0525 + 21 was also observed in one of these sessions following the same strategy ( phase referenced using j0521 + 2112 ) , in order to perform an empirical analysis of the derived astrometry in interferometric single - burst imaging . in the following three sessions in september , however , we conducted 5-min cycles with 3.5  min on the target and 1.5  min on the phase calibrator , improving the phase referencing , and hence providing more accurate astrometry .",
    "two sessions failed to produce useful calibrated data on the faint target , and are not listed in table  [ tab : data ] . the first session ( 2016 feb 1 )",
    "was used to explore different calibration approaches , whereas the 2016 sep 19 session was unusable because the largest evn stations were unavailable and the data could not be properly calibrated without them .",
    "an extragalactic @xmath91  mjy compact source ( vla2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was identified in the same primary beam as frb  121102(with coordinates @xmath92 ) .",
    "this source has been used to acquire relative astrometry of frb  121102during all the sessions and to provide a proper motion constraint .",
    "the 2-s integrated data were calibrated using standard vlbi procedures within aips and parseltongue @xcite , including _ a priori _ amplitude calibration using system temperatures and gain curves for each antenna , antenna - based delay correction and bandpass calibration .",
    "the phases were corrected by fringe - fitting the calibrators .",
    "the phase calibrator j0529 + 3209 was then imaged and self - calibrated using the caltech difmap package @xcite .",
    "these corrections were interpolated and applied to frb  121102 , which was finally imaged in difmap .",
    "the arrival times of the bursts were first identified using arecibo single - dish data , and then slightly refined for application to the evn data . first using coherently dedispersed arecibo auto - correlations from the evn data , we performed a so - called gate search by creating a large number of short integrations inside a 50-ms window around the nominal arecibo single - dish arrival times .",
    "a pulse profile was then created for each of the bursts by plotting the total power in the cross - correlations as a function of time .",
    "we then used this pulse profile to determine the exact time window for which the correlation function was accumulated , i.e. the ` gate ' .",
    "we de - dispersed and correlated the evn data to produce visibilities for windows covering only the times of detected bursts .",
    "we applied the previously described calibration to the single - pulse data and imaged them .",
    "the final images were produced using a briggs robust weighting of zero @xcite as it produced the most consistent results ( balance between the longest baselines to arecibo and the shorter , intra - european baselines ) .",
    "images with natural or uniform weighting did not produce satisfactory results due to the sparse @xmath93-coverage .",
    "the flux densities and positions for all datasets were measured using difmap and casa by fitting a circular gaussian component to the detected source in the @xmath93-plane .",
    "the evn observations detect the compact and persistent source found by @xcite with a synthesized beam size ( fwhm ) of @xmath94 at 1.7  ghz and @xmath95 at 5  ghz , with position angle @xmath96 in both cases .    on 2016",
    "sep 20 , we detected four individual bursts in the arecibo single - dish puppi data that overlap with evn data acquisition ( table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "no bursts were detected in the arecibo puppi ( 1.7  ghz ) or mock ( 5  ghz ) data from other sessions in which there are simultaneous evn observations that can be used for imaging the bursts .",
    "we formed images from the calibrated visibility data for each burst , and measured their positions with respect to the persistent radio source .",
    "figure  [ fig : burst_image ] shows these positions together with the persistent source at 1.7 and 5.0  ghz .",
    "the nominal positions measured for the four bursts are spread @xmath97 around the position of the persistent source , and we discuss this scatter in  [ sec : astrometry ] .    figures  [ fig : pulse_det1 ] and [ fig : pulse_det2 ] show data corresponding to the strongest burst ( burst  # 2 )  in the time - domain and in the image plane , respectively . we have characterized the bursts using the detection statistic @xmath98 ( fluence divided by the square - root of the burst width ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when matched filtering is done to detect a pulse ( as we have done , starting with the single - dish puppi data ) , then the s / n of the detection statistic , i.e. the output of the correlation , is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "localization of the source in an image ( whether in the image or in the _ uv _ domain ) will tend to have the same scaling if the _",
    "uv _ data are calculated with a tight gate ( time window ) around the pulse so that it also scales as @xmath100 .",
    "using only fluence as a detection statistic is not appropriate because a high - fluence , very wide burst can still be buried in the noise , whereas a narrower burst with equivalent fluence is more easily discriminated from noise .",
    "burst  # 2 was roughly an order - of - magnitude brighter than the other 3 bursts , and shows a detection statistic @xmath99 that is also a factor of @xmath101 higher than the other bursts .",
    "this brightest burst is separated by only @xmath102 from the centroid of the persistent source at the same epoch and is positionally consistent at the @xmath3-@xmath20 level .",
    "we thus find no convincing evidence that there is a significant offset between the source of the bursts and the persistent source .",
    "since burst  # 2 s detection statistic , @xmath99 , is significantly larger than for any of the other three bursts , its apparent position is least affected by noise in the image plane , as we explain in the following section ,  [ sec : astrometry ] . as such ,",
    "in principle it provides the most accurate position of all 4 detected bursts , and the strongest constraint on the maximum offset between bursts and the compact , persistent radio source .",
    "+   +     +      the astrometric accuracy of full - track ( horizon - to - horizon observations ) evn phase - referencing is usually limited by systematic errors due to the poorly modeled troposphere , ionosphere and other factors .",
    "these errors are less than a milliarcsecond in ideal cases @xcite , but in practice they can be a few milliarcseconds . given the short duration of the bursts ( a few milliseconds ) , our interferometric evn data only contain a limited number of visibilities for each burst , which results in a limited @xmath93-coverage and thus very strong , nearly equal - power sidelobes in the image plane ( see figure  [ fig : pulse_det2 ] , bottom panel ) . in this case",
    "we are no longer limited only by the low - level systematics described above .",
    "the errors in the visibilities , either systematic or due to thermal noise , may lead to large and non - gaussian uncertainties in the position , especially for low s / n , because the response function has many sidelobes .",
    "it is not straightforward to derive the astrometric errors for data with just a few - milliseconds integration .",
    "therefore , we conducted the following procedure to verify the validity of the observed positions and to estimate the errors .",
    "first , we independently estimated the approximate position of the strongest burst by fringe - fitting the burst data and using only the residual delays ( delay mapping ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in prep . ) ) . with this method",
    "we have obtained an approximate position of @xmath103 , where the quoted errors are at the 3-@xmath20 level .",
    "this method provides additional confidence that the image - plane detection of the bursts is genuine , since the positions obtained with the two methods are consistent at the 3-@xmath20 level .",
    "next , we carried out an empirical analysis of single - burst evn astrometry by imaging 406 pulses recorded from the pulsar b0525 + 21 , which was used as a test source in the 2016 feb 11 session .",
    "psr  b0525 + 21 has typical pulse widths of roughly 200  ms and peak flux densities of @xmath104@xmath105 .",
    "this corresponds to a range of measured detection statistics @xmath106@xmath107  jy  ms@xmath108 , compared to the range @xmath109@xmath110  jy  ms@xmath108 measured for the 4 detected frb  121102bursts .",
    "figure  [ fig : test_source ] shows the obtained positions for the different psr  b0525 + 21 pulses along with the synthesized beam fwhm for comparison .",
    "this demonstrates that the positional accuracy of the bursts increases for larger @xmath99 .",
    "it shows that pulses with @xmath111  jy  ms@xmath108 are typically offset by less than the beam fwhm , whereas for @xmath106@xmath112  jy  ms@xmath108 the scatter can be closer to 10  mas .",
    "this matches well with what we have observed in the four detected frb  121102bursts ( table  [ tab : data ] , figure  [ fig : burst_image ] ) .",
    "while burst  # 2 is thus expected to provide the most accurate position , a more conservative way to estimate the positional error on the burst source is to consider the scatter in all four detections , which is @xmath113  mas around the average position . in figure",
    "[ fig : burst_image ] we show the average position from the four observed bursts , weighted by their detection statistic @xmath99 ( table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "this average position ( separated @xmath114 with respect to the persistent source ) shows that the average burst position and the persistent source position are coincident within @xmath115 .",
    "we therefore claim no significant positional offset between the persistent radio source and the source of the frb  121102bursts .    finally , we place limits on the angular separation between the source of the bursts and the persistent radio source by sampling from gaussian distributions with centers and widths given by the source positions and uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : data ] and deriving a numerical distribution of offsets . using the average burst position compared to that of the persistent source , this results in a separation of @xmath2  mas ( @xmath1  pc ) at the 95% confidence level ( or @xmath116",
    "pc at 99.5% confidence level ) .",
    "although the positional uncertainties on individual bursts are likely underestimated and non - gaussian , as discussed previously , the effect of this should be mitigated somewhat by using the average burst position , which includes an uncertainty determined by the scatter in the separate burst detections , as also seen in figure  [ fig : test_source ] for b0525 + 21 .",
    "we note that nearly identical separation limits are obtained if we consider instead the position of only the strongest burst , burst  # 2 .",
    "fitting the @xmath93-plane data with a circular gaussian component shows that both the bursts and persistent radio source appear to be slightly extended .",
    "we measure a source size of @xmath117 at 1.7  ghz in the detected bursts in the @xmath93-plane . in the persistent source we measure a similar value of @xmath118@xmath4 at 1.7  ghz in all sessions , whereas at 5.0  ghz we measure an angular size of @xmath75@xmath119 .",
    "measurements in the image plane ( after deconvolving the synthesized beam ) result in similar values .",
    "the measured source sizes for the persistent source are consistent with the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "+    notably , burst  # 2 shows two pulse components , separated by approximately 1  ms ( figure  [ fig : pulse_det1 ] ) .",
    "complex profile structure is commonly seen in the brightest frb  121102  bursts observed to date , many of which show two or more pulse components ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hessels et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen in the dynamic spectrum of the burst , there is fine - scale frequency structure ( @xmath8  mhz ) in the intensity , which in principle could be due to scintillation or self noise .",
    "this will be investigated in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the different epochs at which the persistent radio source was observed allow us to obtain the light - curve of the compact source .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the flux densities measured for the five sessions at 1.7  ghz , which are compatible with an average flux density of @xmath120 .",
    "the only session at 5.0  ghz shows a compact source with a flux density of @xmath121 . assuming that the source exhibited a similar flux density at 1.7  ghz compared with the day before , we infer a two - point spectral index @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , for the source .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] summarizes the obtained results .",
    "@xcite have shown that the persistent radio source is associated with an optical counterpart , which @xcite show is a low - metallicity , star forming dwarf galaxy at a redshift of @xmath15 . in the following ,",
    "we use the luminosity and angular diameter distances of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , determined by @xcite .",
    "we show that the vlbi data alone provide further support to the extragalactic origin of both radio sources .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the bursts and the persistent radio source must be physically related because of their close proximity to each other .",
    "we assume such a direct physical link in the following discussion .",
    "the results from all the evn observations conducted at 1.7  ghz show a compact source with a persistent emission of @xmath124 , which is consistent with the flux densities inferred at @xmath125 larger angular scales with the vla @xcite .",
    "no significant , short - term changes in the flux density are observed after the arrival of the bursts or otherwise ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the average flux density of the persistent source implies a radio luminosity of @xmath126 .",
    "the single measured flux density at 5.0  ghz corresponds to a similar luminosity of @xmath127 ( @xmath128 , with a bandwidth of 128  mhz at both frequencies ) .",
    "additionally , the 5.0-ghz data allow us to set a constraint on the brightness temperature of the persistent source of @xmath129 . considering the measured radio luminosities and the current 5-@xmath20 x - ray upper limit in the @xmath21@xmath22  kev band of @xmath130 (",
    "* which implies @xmath23 ) we infer a ratio between the 5.0-ghz radio and x - ray luminosities of @xmath131 , where @xmath132 as defined by @xcite .",
    "the strongest observed burst exhibits a luminosity of @xmath133 at 1.7  ghz in the 2-ms integrated data .",
    "these values imply an energy of @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the emission solid angle .    with the evn sessions spanning a period of approximately 7 months , we derived a constraint on the proper motion of the persistent source of @xmath136 , and @xmath137 at a 3-@xmath20 confidence level .",
    "these values have been obtained after removing the offsets measured in the in - beam calibrator source ( vla2 , see   [ sec : obs ] ) . since most of our short observations were not ideal for astrometry ,",
    "this is a preliminary result , to be further improved on by follow - up observations , which will also have the advantage of spanning a longer period of time .",
    "nonetheless , these results already rule out the presence of parallax @xmath138 at a 3-@xmath20 confidence level , setting a distance for the persistent source @xmath139 .",
    "the compactness of the source at 5.0  ghz allows us to set an upper limit on its projected physical size of @xmath5 ( @xmath140 , given the distance of the source ) .",
    "the angular size measured for the source at 1.7 and 5.0  ghz ( @xmath3 and @xmath75  mas , respectively ) is consistent with the angular broadening expected in the direction to frb  121102for extragalactic sources due to local scattering ( multi - path propagation ) of the signal by the intervening galactic material between the source and the observer ( predicted by the ne2001 model to be @xmath141 at 1.7  ghz ; @xcite ) .",
    "angular broadening scales as @xmath142 and thus we would expect a size of @xmath143 at 5.0  ghz , also roughly consistent with the measured value at that frequency .",
    "the obtained angular sizes are thus likely to be produced by angular broadening and not by the fact that we are resolving the source .",
    "the angular broadening measured in the bursts ( @xmath144 ) supports this statement as this broadening must be produced extrinsically to the bursts , given that their millisecond duration implies that the emitting region must be smaller than the light - crossing time , i.e. @xmath145 , and thus must appear to be point - like .",
    "a caveat here is that the measured source size depends strongly on the gain of the telescope providing the longest baselines @xcite , in our case arecibo at 1.7  ghz .",
    "we exclude the possibility that the arecibo baselines have a lower amplitude ( due to a large gain error ) , because the measured persistent source size agrees with that obtained with the vlba independently @xcite . at 5.0  ghz the presence of three telescopes with similar baseline lengths ( arecibo , hartebeesthoek and tianma ) also assures the consistency of the measured source size .",
    "the intrinsic source size of the persistent source could be as small as @xmath146 , the limit implied by synchrotron self - absorption for a frequency of optical depth unity @xmath147 @xcite . or if @xmath148  k by synchrotron self - compton radiation , the size is @xmath149 .",
    "these angles are too small to resolve with vlbi but could be probed with interstellar scintillations .",
    "we have constrained the projected separation between the source of the bursts and the persistent radio source to be @xmath150 .",
    "such a close proximity strongly suggests that there is a direct physical link between the bursts and the persistent source , as we now discuss in more detail .",
    "the data presented here , in addition to the results presented by @xcite and @xcite , allow us to constrain the possible physical scenarios for the origin of frb  121102 .",
    "while the fact that the bursts are located within @xmath150 of the persistent radio source strongly suggests a direct physical link , the persistent radio source and the source of the frb  121102bursts do nt necessarily have to be the same object .",
    "we primarily consider two classes of models that could explain frb  121102and its multiwavelength counterparts : a highly energetic , extragalactic neutron star in a young supernova remnant ( snr ) or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; or analogously a black hole related system with a jet ) .",
    "as previously shown by @xcite , the repeatability of frb  121102rules out an origin in a cataclysmic event that destroyed the progenitor source , e.g. the collapse of a supramassive neutron star @xcite .",
    "the repetition and energetics of the bursts from frb 121102 have been used to argue that it comes from a young neutron star or magnetar @xcite . at birth ,",
    "the rapid spin of such ( potentially highly magnetized ) objects can power a luminous nebula from the region evacuated by its snr .",
    "the measured luminosity for the persistent radio source can not be explained by a single snr or a pulsar wind nebula similar to those discovered thus far in our galaxy . a direct comparison with one of the brightest snrs known , cas  a ( 300  yr old ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows that we would expect an emission which is @xmath151 orders of magnitude fainter at the given distance of @xmath16 . in the case of the crab nebula",
    ", the expected flux density would be even fainter ( @xmath152 ) if placed in the host galaxy of frb  121102 . compact star forming regions , such as seen in arp  220 , have collections of snrs that have a luminosity and @xmath153 consistent with the persistent radio source .",
    "however , neither the sfr of @xmath154@xmath155 nor the size of the region of @xmath156@xmath157 of arp  220 @xcite agrees with the properties of the persistent source associated with frb  121102(@xmath158 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the properties of a young ( @xmath159 ) snr that is powered by the spin - down power of a neutron star or white dwarf .",
    "the snr expands into the surrounding medium and evacuates an ionized region that can be seen as a luminous synchrotron nebula .",
    "this model is also constrained by the observation that radio bursts of frb  121102are not absorbed by the nebula and that its dm has not evolved significantly over the last few years .",
    "considering all these effects , in this scenario frb  121102is likely to be between 100 and 1000  yr old and the persistent radio source is powered by the spin down of a rapidly rotating pulsar or magnetar . in this case , the previously shown persistent radio source variability ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where the higher cadence of observations allowed variability to be studied in more detail ) could be induced by scintillation , which is consistent with the compact ( sub - milliarcsecond ) snr size at this age . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) are typically hosted by low - metallicity , low - mass galaxies , and are possibly powered by millisecond magnetars .",
    "additionally , it is shown that slsne and long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) could share similar environments .",
    "we note that these conditions are in agreement with the optical galaxy associated with frb  121102@xcite .",
    "models have been proposed in which the bursts are due to strong plasma turbulence excited by the relativistic jet of an agn @xcite or due to synchrotron maser activity from an agn @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable to have an extremely young and energetic pulsar and/or magnetar near to an agn @xcite  either interacting or not .",
    "the persistent radio source is offset by @xmath75  arcsec ( 0.7  kpc ) from the apparent center of the optical emission of the dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not completely clear whether the radio source can be associated with the galactic nucleus or not , but an offset agn is plausible as reported in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "if the persistent source is indeed an agn in the right accretion state , we can infer the mass of the black hole assuming the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite . given the measured radio luminosity and the upper limit on the x - ray value",
    ", we estimate a lower limit on the mass of the putative black hole of @xmath160",
    ". this value would be hard to reconcile with the fact that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is likely at least an order of magnitude less than that , and its optical spectrum shows no signatures of agn activity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could be witnessing a radio - loud , but otherwise low - luminosity agn powered by a much less massive black hole that accretes at a very low rate .",
    "this population is poorly known , but evn observations of the brightest low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) in a sample of fundamental plane outliers ( i.e. radio - loud , with @xmath161 ) show that some of these have extended jets / lobes and the radio excess may come from strong interaction with the surrounding gas in the galaxy ; others appear very compact like our persistent radio source , and the reason for their high @xmath162 remains a mystery @xcite .",
    "we note that there are other recent examples of llagns identified based on their vlbi properties coupled with low - levels of x - ray emission and no signs of nuclear activity from the optical emission lines @xcite .    other possible associations , like a single x - ray binary ( such as cyg  x-3 ; @xcite ) or an ultraluminous x - ray nebula ( such as s  26 and/or ic  342  x-1 ; @xcite )",
    ", do not fit to the measured flux density of the persistent radio emission and/or the observed size by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the bursts of frb  121102have recently been associated with a persistent and compact radio source @xcite and a low - metallicity star forming dwarf galaxy at a redshift of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the evn data presented in this work show for the first time that the bursts and the persistent source are co - located with an angular separation @xmath163 ( @xmath150 given the distance to the host galaxy ) .",
    "this tight constraint ",
    "roughly an order of magnitude more precise localization compared to that achieved with the vla in @xcite  strongly suggests a direct physical link , though the persistent radio source and the source of the frb  121102bursts do nt necessarily have to be the same object .",
    "although the origin of frbs remains unknown , the data presented here are consistent in many respects with either an interpretation in terms of a low - luminosity agn or a young snr powered by a highly energetic neutron star / magnetar .",
