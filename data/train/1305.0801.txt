    "the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ? * ) on the solar dynamics observatory(sdo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides continuous full - disk observations of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) channels , spanning a temperature range from some 20,000k to in excess of 20mk @xcite .",
    "the 12-second cadence of the image stream with 4096 by 4096 pixel images at 0.6arcsec / pixel provides unprecedented views of the various phenomena that occur within the evolving solar outer atmosphere .    with the full - disk coverage and the multitude of events going on on the sun at any given time",
    ", it is not surprising that many events are seen to occur synchronously or near - synchronously . in many cases , this ( near-)synchronicity is a matter of chance . during the 976-day time interval from the start of the sdo prime mission ( 2010/05/01 ) through the last of the searched dates for this study ( 2012/12/31 )",
    "the noaa / goes logs contained 2881 flares of class c1 or above , or on average 3.0 flares per day .",
    "the study by @xcite counts typically some 4 coronal mass ejections for an average day . for a causal link via an alfvnic signal , we can take a typical time delay @xmath0 for a signal to travel a distance @xmath1 around the solar circumference with a characteristic coronal alfvn speed @xmath2 . for events separated by ,",
    "e.g. , 90@xmath3 , @xmath4 and with @xmath5km / s , we find that @xmath6s , or about 1/40-th of a day .",
    "with 3 flares and 2 cmes a day on the earth - facing hemisphere , each of which can last for up to multiple hours , it is not surprise that many events in the sdo / aia data are seen to overlap in time ( quantitative estimates are provided in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , overlap or proximity in time is not an adequate distinguishing criterion for inferring causal links between events on the sun .    in order to assess the importance of causal linkages in the triggering of near - synchronous events , we first must identify and classify the types of pathways that may connect them . to that end , we have reviewed many near - synchronous events in sdo / aia observations , and here present a selection of those to illustrate the causal linkages . with the available present - day observations",
    ", we can see that many of the events observed with sdo / aia either reveal direct magnetic connections between near - synchronously flaring or erupting regions , while others are highly suggestive of it .",
    "the idea of causal linkage between flaring in different regions goes back to @xcite .",
    "@xcite , following up on his initial report , noted that `` the formal statistical results as well as the visual impression conveyed from inspection of the [ caiik ] photographs suggests that some form of coupling may exist between widely separated spot groups '' , but with the data at hand concluded that `` the question must still be regarded as open . '' since then , multiple studies were published on the possible linkages not only between flares but also between flares and filament activations and even between sets of filament activations ; @xcite , who list many of these early studies , differentiate the linkage between relatively distant regions from another form of linkage , namely that of multiple flares occurring sequentially in the same region , which includes the subset of homologous flares ( with a much - larger scale equivalent in repeating pseudo - streamer blowouts , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among the possible scenarios for linkage between solar impulsive events that were proposed already",
    "early on were fast - moving energetic particles and also shock waves traveling at up to 2000km / s .",
    "evidence for the existence and possible role of these was found at radio and microwave wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thermal energy input conducted via direct field connections was also proposed as a possible causal agent in sympathetic activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "larger data bases , some supported by space - based observations of coronal connections , led to statistical studies in the context of connection patterns in the coronal magnetic field .",
    "@xcite and , for example , following similar studies and conclusions by others cited in their work , used those statistical methods on samples of events to conclude that sympathetic flaring was at most a weak phenomenon , although apparently significant for regions in close proximity of each other ( which those studies found to be closer than @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "suggestions of causal linkage between events are not limited to the flare - flare or flare - filament events , but also include couplings of filament eruptions .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss the possibility of two quiet - sun filament eruptions occurring in the wake of an active - region eruption , with the coupling agent being the field deformation by an eruption ( often with a signature `` coronal dimming '' ) that is instrumental in causing other field configurations that are either connected to it or that lie contained within it to lose their stability .",
    "another such pair of related quiet - sun filament eruptions , along with other flaring activity , was discussed by @xcite .",
    "a magnetic configuration of three adjacent flux ropes was subsequently modeled by @xcite , whose detailed mhd work illustrated how stretched field by one eruption can destabilize one or more other flux - rope configurations nested within a common overlying field .",
    "such linkages , particularly those involving fairly high field , are often not directly observable but can be inferred from models , as was done in the studies mentioned in this paragraph , and in the work by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .    despite the many studies cited above and referenced within those",
    ", the phenomenon of sympathetic activity in the solar corona remains elusive .",
    "yet , in the context of forecasting solar activity , the influence of adjacent or distant regions on the loss of stability of a given region needs to be understood .",
    "this is particularly important for the development and propagation of cmes and the resulting particle events and geomagnetic storms : given the frequency of eruptive events on the sun , many cmes are composite events , but understanding their makeup from different events with either physical connections or chance coincidences is important both to the interpretation and the forecast of any heliospheric event under study .    the complete coverage of the earth - facing hemisphere of the solar surface and corona by sdo , supported by far - side observations from the stereo spacecraft @xcite , complemented by the stereo and soho / lasco @xcite coronagraphs and full - sphere coronal field modeling ( such as work by * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* that we use in the present study ) enable a comprehensive empirical assessment of the linkages that exist in the solar corona that may play a role in sympathetic activity . in view of the mixture of positive and negative findings in the literature of the significance of causal linkages between explosive or eruptive events on the sun ,",
    "the aim of this study is not to quantify the frequency of sympathetic couplings , but to assess the evidence for , and to discuss examples of , any of the proposed causal pathways by which couplings may occur .    in selecting the events discussed here , we reviewed much of the sdo / aia data for the period from 2010/05/01 through 2012/12/31 .",
    "based on the review of those observations , we discuss evidence for four fundamentally distinct plausible causal pathways : ( evolving ) direct magnetic connections , waves or propagating disturbances , distortions of and reconnection with overlying field by the eruption of one or more flux ropes elsewhere in the corona , and evolving indirect connections .",
    "one aim of this study is to present evidence for each of these pathways in at least one well - observed case .",
    "our other aim is to illustrate why it is proving difficult to assess the prevalence of sympathetic couplings in the causes of space weather and to point towards future opportunities to alleviate the difficulties in the study of this now nearly 80-year old problem .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the various data sets used in this study and the selection criteria for initial review of candidate data sets .",
    "section  [ sec : casestudies ] reviews the most illuminating cases that support causal linkage of solar events or clearly illustrate a particular difficulty in establishing whether events are synchronous by chance or by interaction . in reviewing each of the events ,",
    "we typically look at events over a full 24-h period and sometimes up to several days . after reviewing section  [ sec : data ]",
    "the reader may choose to jump to the final two sections , where we discuss our findings in a summarizing section  [ sec : conclusions ] and in the concluding section  [ sec : discussion ] , before reviewing the detailed case studies in section  [ sec : casestudies ] .",
    "to aid in the review of the supporting images and movies , we created an on - line table http://www.lmsal.com/forecast/styd.html and include direct links throughout the manuscript shown by a superscript `` s '' followed by a number .",
    "the primary data source for this study is the complete archive of sdo / aia observations .",
    "we selected candidate events using several different approaches .",
    "first , we created 30-minute summed images , downgraded to 64 by 64 pixels , in the 193  channel , using the on - line 2-minute cadence synoptic data set at 1024 by 1024 pixels from 2010/05/01 through 2012/12/31 ( http://jsoc.stanford.edu/data/aia/synoptic/ ) .",
    "we chose the 193  channel because it reveals both flaring activity and the lower - energetic phenomena of eruptions from quiet - sun regions .",
    "we then selected all events that exceeded a flare - like intensity and remapped their coordinates to an evolving synoptic map set , letting the signal fade over a 2-week period to allow patterns to stand out clearly .",
    "all pronounced clusters of events were subsequently reviewed in the daily summary movies of aia observations , in the process eliminating instrumental artifacts related to spacecraft rolls and off - points , data gaps , and calibration mode data .    as a next pre - selection criterion , we reviewed all m- and x - class flares in the aia archive during the same period , and once again reviewed all daily summary movies for those dates .",
    "we also collected candidate events during daily reviews of aia data as annotated into the heliophysics events registry @xcite . from the sample of some five dozen candidate events",
    ", we selected the ten cases that were most compelling by visual inspection in supporting causal connections .    for selected events , we also made and reviewed running - ratio movies in which the 211 , 193 , and 171  channels were combined .",
    "the frames in these image sequences were created by first computing logarithmic differences for time - averaged images ( for 264s averages of fixed - exposure frames taken at 24s cadence and 2minute offsets between successive frames to be differenced for these movies ) , and then combining these in sets of three into the rgb color planes of a movie ( clipping the scales at relative brightening or dimming to range from 0.1 to 10 ) .",
    "these `` tri - ratio''image sets readily reveal changes in intensity , be they in bright active - region settings or in quiet - sun or off - disk signals .",
    "the summary sdo / aia data for the selected events can be reviewed via the on - line table@xmath9 at http://www.lmsal.com/forecast/styd.html .",
    "for further review of the possible physical links between the selected data , we used potential - field source - surface ( pfss ) models using the magnetogram assimilation code developed by @xcite , updated to assimilate sdo / hmi data ( see @xcite for the instrument description ) , using the solarsoft pfss tool ( see http://www.lmsal.com / forecast / surfflux - model - v2/. links to visualizations of the field and an interactive viewing tool are included in the on - line table@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we also compare the aia observations with a magnetofrictional ( mf ) model developed by @xcite , for which snapshots are included in the table .",
    "the mf model incorporates dynamics of the coronal field through the introduction of a dimensionless number that describes the balance between relaxation and diffusion and is the product of a friction coefficient and a diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "a second dimensionless parameter in the mf model is the ratio of the surface and coronal diffusion coefficients .",
    "these two dimensionless parameters were originally calibrated by @xcite ( a ) such that flux ropes form above the internal polarity - inversion line of each active - region bipole with roughly one turn of twist and roughly once per 27 days , and ( b ) such that the field lines at the top of the computational box remained radial .",
    "the models shown in this study use the same parametrization as in the original model .",
    "we note that the mf model run requires selection of the magnitude and sign of the helicity for each emerging bipole ; as these quantities are as a rule not known for active regions , these quantities are selected from a latitude - dependent distribution as described by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the mf model should be viewed as one possible incarnation of a dynamic corona , to be contrasted with the static pfss model , but subject to major uncertainties related to the choice of the above mentioned parameters .",
    "other comparison material included the soho / lasco data viewed using the jhelioviewer package ( http://www.jhelioviewer.org/ ) and the stereo browse data ( with links in our on - line table , and directly accessible at http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/browse ) .    in reviewing and selecting the events discussed in section  [ sec : casestudies ] we paid particular attention to the following possible mechanisms for sympathetic coupling : 1 ) ( evolving ) direct magnetic connection ,",
    "2 ) wave / front perturbation reaches distant region , and 3 ) distortion of overlying field by an eruption .",
    "we always allowed for mere synchronicity , and include discussion of such events in our case studies in the next section . while reviewing events , we generally tracked the duration of the glow of post - eruption arcades in the 171/193/211 - channel composite images ; these durations can be found in the case studies denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "this section describes the events on a selection of 11 dates in detail .",
    "these dates are listed in table  [ tab : couplings ] , which also summarizes our conclusions regarding likely coupling mechanisms ( identifying the times and the regions involved in each such set of events ) . on first reading",
    ", it may be easier first proceed to section  [ sec : conclusions ] in which we summarize the variety of processes before reviewing the following case studies in detail .",
    "an on - line table@xmath9 provides access to the observational and modeling materials used the case studies .",
    "the coronal events on 2010/08/01 have been extensively described by @xcite . following that study ,",
    "the events in the solar corona and their impacts throughout the heliosphere have been studied in a series of papers that include the work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - who describe the coronal field topology in detail - , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the emergence of several new bipolar regions on the far side involved field configurations that directly connected all of the main sites of activity that day , involving a large - scale quasi - separatrix , connecting over several null points above the sites of filament destabilizations , and reaching into a flaring active region and a far - side cme .",
    "we refer to that paper for a detailed description of the events .",
    "@xcite argued that the magnetic topology was such that all of the major coronal events were connected by a quasi - separatrix involving several coronal null points . in an mhd modeling study of a simplified configuration",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the evolution of the common - envelope field over several filaments can cause flux ropes to erupt in the wake of a primary event .",
    "the evolution of the corona , visible in the aia tri - ratio movies @xmath11 as colored events , offers additional support for this process .",
    "in particular , the eruption of a large filament in the western hemisphere appears to induce large - scale reconnection that then allows a second filament eruption ( starting around 06:40 ) .",
    "the discoloration in the tri - ratio images , interpreted as a signature of coronal reconnection induced by the eruption , starts during the first , largest filament eruption .",
    "it is most evident from about 2010/08/01 7:45ut through the end of that day ( @xmath12h ) .",
    "[ fig : lcurve20100801 ] shows the aia light curves for 2010/08/01 , revealing ( a ) that the duration of the events differs considerably between the 94 , 131 , and 335  light curves , where there is one dominant peak with different decay time scales .",
    "moreover , the 171 , 193 , and 211  light curves have a more complex structure that does not lend themselves to the interpretation as a single event .",
    "hence , here ( as in other cases below ) , we can not rely on the disk - integrated light curves , but instead perform a visual inspection of the intensity and tri - ratio image sets to estimate the fading time scales in the emission patterns associated with the events discussed .",
    "the second main filament , lying to the south of and largely parallel to the first , erupts starting about 16:30ut with a noticeable rise speed and developing into a rapid eruption by 19:30ut .",
    "the delay of 9 to 12h between the initially observed thermal changes following the first filament eruption and the ultimate eruption of the second filament may appear rather long , but the thermal signatures of reconnection high in the corona in the wake of the preceding eruption of the largest filament after about 7ut continues until past the end of the day , so is clearly an ongoing process over many hours .    for these events , there is model support for causal linkages , both through the evolution of a series of pfss models that illustrate the possible evolution of the field subject to flux emergence on the far hemisphere of the sun as well as in a simplified mhd model of parallel flux ropes sharing a joint overlying field configuration .",
    "there are direct field connections between the destabilizing configurations , seen in the aia images as in the field models .",
    "but despite all this indirect evidence of causal couplings , direct observational evidence is tenuous , leaving the ultimate interpretation rather subjective as to whether the overall field configuration is responsible for each event occurring with direct connections to the main topological feature , and as to whether the time of occurrence of the destabilizations is in fact affected by the evolution of the surrounding field .",
    "the period around february 14 and 15 , 2011 , shows considerable activity on the sun , with multiple flares and eruptions in the main region , ar11158 , as well as other activity seen on disk and towards the northeast limb .",
    "the main center of activity is a substantial active region in the southern hemisphere , just past central meridian , ar11158 .",
    "the region s x - class flare and associated cme are described in detail by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . here , we focus on february 14 and 15 , when at least 20 c - class events occurred , one m2.2 flare , and the first x - class flare of sunspot cycle 23 ( see the goes light curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : goes20110214 ] ) .",
    "we start our description with a high c - class flare around 2011/02/14 12:50ut .",
    "this event shows an eruption ( @xmath13 m within the active - region core , with coronal signatures elsewhere last at least for 80 m ) from the trailing region of ar11158 towards the trailing part of ar11159 to its north , associated with a coronal propagating front that is most noticeable to the north of ar11158 .",
    "this eruption occurs as a coronal reconfiguration is already in progress towards the north - east limb .",
    "the latter , although extending off the disk into the high corona , is not associated with substantial high - field activity in the soho / lasco - c2 field of view .",
    "there is no obvious field connection to that region in either the pfss or mf models on that day@xmath14 , but there is one in the model fields for a time five days later when more of the near - limb and over - the - limb field has been assimilated ; we return to its discussion below .    around 2011/02/14 17:30ut ,",
    "the same following part of ar11158 is involved in an m2.2 flare .",
    "this event is associated with a pronounced coronal propagating front , that is visible most prominently in all but the southerly directions , appearing to reach to the edges of the streamer belt towards the northeast , and out to the edges of three large topological domes converging on ar11159 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topo20110215 ] ) ( see also the on - line topology movie@xmath15 ) . associated with this flare is a dark 304  arc or surge from the trailing part of ar11158 moving towards the east and south , occurring around 18ut . at the same time , a small filament destabilizes , once again on this day , towards the northwest around @xmath16 ( in arsceconds from disk center ) , in the same location as the field reconfiguration noted for the events following 12:50ut , and within 20minutes of the propagating front reaching a decayed active region just to the southwest of it near @xmath17 .",
    "then , around 18:30ut , there is another eruption from the same part of ar11158 , again associated with activity over the filament configuration to the ne .",
    "this happens once more just after 19ut ( associated with another dark 304  feature moving westward ) in events that are then followed by a high c - class flare around 19:30ut ( @xmath18 m within the region and about 2h in its immediate vicinity ) . in the trailing end of that event , another dark 304  feature is seen , forming threads that reach a long way towards ar11161 .",
    "the x2.2 flare occurs at 2011 - 02 - 15 starting at 01:45ut ( @xmath19 m within the region and about 90 m outside it ) .",
    "this flare is associated with a pronounced coronal propagating front and cme , studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the filament region to the northeast near @xmath16 again shows limited synchronous activity .",
    "this event set appears coupled through the propagating disturbance , which may be either a pure wave or an expansion front that couples to the filament in the northeast through higher field breached by the initiating cme .    in the decay phase of this main flare ( brightest within the central regions of ar11158 )",
    "another eruption from the trailing segment or the active region occurs around 04:30ut ( @xmath20 m in the active region core , some 90 m in its far surroundings ) .",
    "this time , the 304  channel shows a moving , dark connection from ar11158 to ar11161 towards the northeast limb .",
    "this field deformation is a precursor to a mid - c class flare from that region around 05ut , that shows a similar , subsequent dark structure in 304  continuing its motion towards the east and south , now with synchronous brightening and deformations in ar11161 , around 05:40ut being highly suggestive of a direct connection between the region , but falling short of showing convincing evidence , even in high - contrast running - difference image sequences ( not shown ) . by 07ut",
    ", this pair of regions again shows synchronous mild flaring and surging , now involving also a ribbon - like brightening , at least in 304 , in the quiet - sun small filament towards the northeast limb near @xmath16 where repeated activity occurred as described above .    later in the event sequence , ar11161 and",
    "the filament configuration around @xmath16 show pronounced synchronous activity once 2011/02/15 12:20ut , with some activity also at @xmath21 in the compact bipole north of ar11159 .    in between the several near - synchronous events pointed out above , each of the regions involved exhibits activity ( both flares and eruptions ) in the absence of synchronous activity in the other regions , including , for example , the ultimate eruption of the filament towards the northeast limb after about 23:20ut .    the general geometry of the corona on the earth - facing side of the sun@xmath22 appears to be described quite well by the pfss configuration shown in fig .  [ fig : pfss20110215 ] ( showing the configuration one day later when ar11161 that emerged on the far side had been assimilated into the model ) .",
    "the magnetofrictional model for that day@xmath23 shows a connectivity similar to that of the pfss model , suggesting that there are no pronounced flux - rope configurations for 2011/02/14 .",
    "we return to this below , however , arguing that this may be because that formation is delayed in the mf model relative to reality .",
    "the model field and its topological summary in figs .  [ fig : pfss20110215 ] and  [ fig : topo20110215 ] show ( a ) a null point floating above about @xmath24 , and ( b ) a helmet structure that arches over ar11158 connecting to the surface northeastward of ar11161",
    ". the repeated eruptions in the field connecting ar11158 and ar11159 arch towards the coronal null , and must somehow connect through it if it is to explain the synchronous activity in ar11161 .",
    "any reconnection occurring through the coronal null requires corresponding changes on both sides , thus providing a pathway to explain some of the sympathetic activity in ar11158 and the field of and near ar11161 in terms of coupled fields , and thus in terms of sympathy .",
    "eruptions that become cmes have to breach the field under the helmet configuration , which involves field reaching down to the ar11169 and its surroundings ( as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : topo20110215 ] ) .    in view of the repeated near - synchronous activity and suggestions of connecting signals ( surges or waves )",
    ", one might conclude that the dynamics of the evolving field forced by the frequent activity in ar11158 is likely not adequately captured by the approximations of a static ( pfss ) or slowly evolving ( mf ) field .",
    "we also note that the details of the high configuration of the field for these days is quite sensitive to changes in the solar surface field . the pfss field based on",
    "the revised assimilation procedure ( `` version 2 '' , see http://www.lmsal.com/forecast/surfflux-model-v2/ ) shown in this study and that computed for version  1 in @xcite show different configurations for the helmet streamer than those in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo20110215 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the solar surface for this date appears to lie under the warped , undulating helmet configuration , so invoking the disruption of that configuration by nascent cmes in causal linkages would not be readily falsifiable in this case .",
    "moreover , the many non - synchronous events in the main activity centers demonstrates that care needs to be taken in interpreting the synchronous ones as consequences of sympathetic coupling even if pathways in the magnetic field are identified .    in the end",
    ", we propose that the events on 2011/02/14 - 15 are , in fact , causally connected .",
    "this is based on a view of the mf configuration for 2011/02/16 , when more near - limb field has been assimilated into the models .",
    "this configuration in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf20110216 ] shown from the earth s perspective for 2011/02/14 .",
    "this field model clearly shows a rope connecting ar11158 to ar11161 , as it links through ar11159 , and it shows another high rope - like configuration ( shown in red ) from ar11161 to above the location from where the northernmost quiet - sun filament lifted off .",
    "this model connection is supported by the repeated activation of the filament towards the northeast limb closely following activity in ar11158 .",
    "the southern base of that rope connects to a region of major flaring in the trailing part of ar11158 , where another rope goes southeastward into the direction of the major surge around 2011/02/15 04ut . here ,",
    "what appear to be ropes connect all of the regions of activity involved , and the footpoints of all ropes are directly adjacent from one connecting segment to the next , if not in fact interlinked .    in conclusion , we find evidence of synchronous activity in directly connected regions where the connecting field is affected by flares or eruptions in at least one of these connected regions .",
    "the synchronicity of events in more distant regions , both in quiet - sun field and to active - region field , may be by chance , but the mf model for the configuration a few days after the above events ( when more of the field involved is on disk and assimilated into the models ) is highly suggestive of direct connections between all regions involved .",
    "the final week of september of 2011 showed considerable activity : along with a multitude of lesser events , there were 8 m flares on the 24th , 6 on the 25th , and 2 more on the 26th . here , we focus on the activity on 2011/09/25 and 26 when the main regions were well onto the disk and the overall magnetic patterns readily observable and models subject to less uncertainty .",
    "the 25th begins in the decay phase of an eruptive m1.0 flare from ar11303 in the southwest ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pfss20110925 ] ) , associated with a cme as seen in soho / lasco .",
    "this is followed , around 01:15ut , by near - synchronous eruptions from the northwest limb and from the trailing side of ar11302 .",
    "these events occur on opposite sides of the helmet streamer and are unlikely to be physically connected ( cf .",
    "[ fig : topo20110925 ] ) .",
    "the first large flare , class m.4 . , starts in the goes data at 02:27ut in ar11302 ( @xmath20 m ) , in the northern hemisphere and east of central meridian . at about 02:35ut , the flare reaches its peak in the aia channels ( with a very pronounced diffraction pattern revealing a compact kernel ) . at that time",
    "ar11303 at the southwest limb is also brightening , reaching its peak brightness ( also with a pronounced diffraction pattern ) just minutes later .",
    "the diffraction patterns in these two events , indicative of compact flare kernels , brighten within about 70s of each other ; for a signal traveling between these two regions over the solar surface , this would require velocities in excess of 20,000km / s .",
    "the synchronicity is thus either associated with energetic particles , occurs simply by chance , or there is some other evolution that causes both of these events to go off simultaneously .",
    "we find no unambiguous evidence for such an intermediary event in either the observations or in the model fields , but do point out that there was a preceding cme from the direction of ar11303 visible in soho / lasco c2 from 00:36ut onward and some 10min .",

    "the mf configuration for 2011/12/11 shows the low - lying flux rope ( at and below 1.1 r@xmath42 ) extending over 130 degrees , with a higher rope configuration ( around @xmath43r@xmath42 ) over a 70-degree span above the main filament eruption site ; this high configuration may be what the stereo a / b cor1 showed as a gradually rising rope , although then manifested at apparently higher latitudes .",
    "six days later , the high rope has mostly disappeared from the model , having evolved away while the low - lying rope has lost its leading segment around where the eruption occurred , both presumably in part because of newly emerged field on the far side , and possibly because of a loss of equilibrium in the overall configuration .    in the eruption evolving around 8ut , the 304  image sequences ( see the on - line sdo / stereo 304  movie@xmath9 and , in particular , the running difference image set@xmath44 described in the caption to fig .

    "the absence of clear stretched - field signatures , other than the expanding cme ( shock ) front , in stereo / a cor1 , however , suggests that the structures seen from soho / lasco c2 may not , in fact , map onto the disk as seen from earth .",
    "there is no obvious direct evidence for coupled substantial activity for 2012/02/09 , although the pronounced cooling seen in the quiet - sun filament region around @xmath51 during the rise and eruption of the prominence over the northeast limb is suggestive of the existence of long - range couplings in the field that are manifested during the eruption possibly through high - arching field next to open field that is rooted in a patch around @xmath56 .",
    "we note that with these events occurring on the eastern hemisphere , and major parts of that on the east limb , the model field configuration may not reflect all the relevant parts as the field underlying these events is far from fully assimilated into the field models .",
    "another interpretation is the analogy with the model discussed by @xcite , in which reconnection during the eruption process forms long - range connections that can lead to dimming and adiabatic cooling of plasma on loops connecting far away .",
    "we have shown evidence that directly - connected , adjacent coronal volumes ( in any combination of active and quiet regions ) can be involved in sympathetic events when the connecting field is affected by a flare or eruption ( examples discussed in this study include cases a , b , c , g ) . similarly , adjacent filaments , nested within a larger overall configuration , can be associated in coupled eruptions , as explored in the mhd model by @xcite , for which cases a and h contain good illustrations .    for case  i ,",
    "there is only weak evidence of long - range couplings in the pfss and mf field models between an erupting east - limb filament and a dimming , cooling region in the quiet sun on disk .",
    "this coupling appears to be through high - arching field under a helmet adjacent to an open - field patch ( reminiscent of the model by lugaz et al , 2012 ) .",
    "although the field configuration for such a volume of the corona near the eastern limb is subject to major uncertainties , the unusual evolution of intensity profiles and thermal signatures over an on - disk region of quiet - sun as an east - limb filament eruption proceeds suggests that such connections do , in fact , exist .",
    "we suggest that these eastern - hemispheric events illustrate that magnetic connections in this case are not correctly approximated by the pfss and mf field models simply because much of the surface field involved is not , or only poorly , visible by existing magnetographs .",
    "another illustration of the problems associated with the poor magnetograph coverage is found in case  b : a magnetofrictional field model for 2011/02/16 reveals a set of connecting field structures that ties together all of the major activity for the preceding days of activity , but these connections had not fully developed in the model by then .",
    "given the patterns of coronal activity on the 14th and 15th , it is possible that connections that already exist in the real corona were yet to develop in the model .",
    "another likely example of the consequences of not having all of the information of the surface field near the edge of the visible disk and beyond is that of case  g , where the aia observations show a direct connection between two distant regions linked by a coupled eruption and flare .",
    "a fourth example of this is that of case  a described in detail by @xcite who explicitly show the substantial coronal evolution between a pfss model that includes regions that emerged on the far solar hemisphere and one that does not .    in other cases ,",
    "field models are helpful in revealing connections where nestings of field , some including ropes , could not evolve without upsetting adjacent fields ( of which case  c is a good example ) .",
    "in other cases , these field models reveal that evolution in one region affects the evolution in a distant region via connections that sit side by side in a third location ( e.g. , cases  b and  d ) and that thus may involve a coronal null .",
    "detailed mhd modeling is needed to reveal to what degree such multi - hop connections , mutually influencing each other as they evolve , communicate evolutionary signals leading to sympathetic activity .    among the cases discussed ,",
    "we have identified a few in which coronal propagating expansion fronts or shock waves ( or both ) reach ( the vicinity of ) other regions ( quiet or active ) that then destabilize and erupt ( such as in cases  c and  h , and perhaps b ) . understanding the potential couplings in such cases also calls for detailed evolutionary mhd models .    in other event sets , such as some in case  h and for case",
    "f , there may be no evidence for connections of any kind between two distant eruptions . in those cases distinct eruptions from different sites",
    "overlap in time so that the resulting inner - heliospheric perturbation develops as a single composite event .",
    "knowing of such composite events is important to understanding the possible impacts on geospace and to the forecasting of such impacts .",
    "in contrast to this , case  e shows how much of the front - side corona can be evolving , but without introducing noticeable confusion about the source regions and triggering events of inner - heliospheric perturbations .",
    "our study leads us to two primary conclusions : ( 1 ) long - range couplings by several distinct physical mechanisms affect the evolution of the large - scale corona , and ( 2 ) the structure of the large - scale coronal field is the product of insertion , buildup , ejection , and relaxation of electrical current systems that are inadequately represented by present - day modeling and impossible to reconstruct from present - day observational data .",
    "these properties of the dynamic , 3-dimensional , dynamic corona need to be incorporated into assimilative models that couple the solar surface to the heliosphere to accurately forecast the solar wind , its variable properties , and the pathways of solar energetic particles .",
    "present - day instrumentation supported by relatively elementary modeling for the global coronal field has revealed at least three different ways eruptive and explosive events in the solar outer atmosphere influence the destabilization of other regions : evolving direct magnetic coupling , distortion of the enveloping field by a large eruption developing into a cme , and the effects of an expansion front or coronal wave associated with a major flare or eruption .",
    "observations suggest that indirect coupling through an intermediate region adjacent to a mutual separatrix surface could be another pathway for couplings to occur .    whereas in some cases the evidence for coupling between events is direct and uncontroversial , in many others it depends on the applicability of the model fields used in the interpretation .",
    "this presents a major problem for several reasons .",
    "first , the overall coronal field is built up through flux emergence , shear , and eruptions that require a full - sphere model and likely at least a full rotation of model time prior to the event to be studied ( see the model and discussion by * ? ? ?",
    ". it may require more than a year of solar time for the high - latitude fields that involve , among others , the polar crown filament configurations which are long - term assemblages of years of active - region decay products ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is not only computationally demanding , but also requires that we increase our observational coverage of the solar surface in at least line - of - sight , perhaps even vector - magnetograms , from only the earth - facing side as available at present to a substantially larger coverage of the solar surface .    in order to succeed in obtaining an acceptable model representation of the real - world coronal field",
    ", we have to realize that field disturbed by a cme requires a good fraction of a day to relax . a lower limit to that time scale",
    "is set by the euv afterglow of post - eruption arcades ( extending beyond , for example , the time interval during which supra - arcade downflows might be visible , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for 21 eruptions from outside active - region core domains studied here ,",
    "the average coronal relaxation time estimated from 171 , 193 , and 211  signals is @xmath57h .",
    "the time scale for the euv afterglow following quiet - sun eruptions of @xmath57h is much longer than the corresponding signatures of flares and eruptions within active regions .",
    "there @xmath58h ( estimated from 8 events , with one strong outlier ) .",
    "we can compare that ratio of @xmath59 with a ratio of typical timescales involved . for length scales @xmath60 and alvn speeds @xmath61 we can derive a time scale ratio of @xmath62 ) . for typical length scales of 250 mm and 50 mm , field strengths of 10 g and 100 g , and densities of @xmath63@xmath64 and @xmath65@xmath64 for quiet - sun coronal regions and active - region flaring interiors ,",
    "we find @xmath66 . that ratio is compatible with the observed ratio of time scales , consistent with the interpretation that the euv eruption afterglow in quiet sun is a signature of the post - eruption reconnection like the relaxation that occurs in active regions after eruptions .    with 4 cmes going off on an average day",
    ", this long reconnection time scale means that the high coronal field is most likely often evolving from the disturbing effects of previous eruptions at the time of any event that we elect to study .",
    "how much of the coronal field is involved in such reconfiguration ?",
    "one might look at the angular extent of cmes to estimate this .",
    "@xcite show a power - law distribution of cme opening angles with an average power - law index of @xmath67 that holds for opening angles of 10@xmath3 up to above 120@xmath3 .",
    "the average opening angle is about 50@xmath3 , corresponding to about 1/10th of the full sky as seen from the sun .",
    "one might thus infer that roughly 1/10th of the corona by volume is involved in an average eruption .",
    "however , even a cme with a small opening angle must break all field that closes over its site of origin . with a typical base cross section of order 100@xmath3 for the helmet streamer belt in the pfss approximation , and assuming a comparable width along and across the helmet direction , then up to @xmath68rd or the solar surface",
    "may have a fraction of its field forced to reconnect during a cme .",
    "the latter estimate is consistent with the extent over which perturbations are seen to travel in the tri - ratio movies such as shown in the on - line table@xmath9 .",
    "if we take @xmath69 to be characteristic of the reconnection time scale for the high coronal field , and for an average of 4 cmes / day that each reach over about 1/3rd of the solar surface , about one in @xmath70 of all cmes affect field that is still relaxing from preceding cmes .",
    "the time scale for ongoing reconnection is likely larger than @xmath69 ; if we use a reconnection time scale of @xmath71 then close to one in @xmath72 cmes occur while the field that it encompasses is still relaxing .    in view of this",
    ", one should question the validity of any global coronal model at the start of a selected event that does not include in its computation at least several preceding eruptions .",
    "the events of , and model for , case  a are an excellent illustration of this : even as the model shows how one filament can be destabilized in the wake of another s eruption , and although this certainly appears to be the case on that date , the second filament does not take off until half a day after the nearby afterglow of the reconnection arcades associated with the first eruption faded away ; only the continuing afterglow in a more distant location ( at the edge of the northern coronal hole ) bore witness to the ongoing deformation of the field enveloping the filaments and flux - rope configurations .",
    "the double filament eruptions in case  h are similar in that respect , with the eruptions in that case separated by approximately 7h .",
    "this work has illustrated that we should anticipate that in many instances , connections in the solar corona exist that present - day coronal field models do not reveal .",
    "the fundamental problem that we face in understanding the connections in the solar corona even in the absence of eruptive events is that of the dependence of its instantaneous state on what happened before , i.e. , its magnetohydrodynamic hysteresis .",
    "in addition to the effects on time scale from flux emergence in days to field evolution over months , there are those that occur on time scales of hours to a day associated with cmes .",
    "these are particularly important to understanding the evolution , and at least in some cases the triggering , of cmes as well as the generation and escape pathways for solar energetic particles into the heliosphere ( see also , for example , the study by * ? ? ? * and references therein on the role of precursor activity in seeding the coronal environment with particles that can be effectively accelerated to high energies in subsequent events ) .",
    "as we are faced with inadequate observational coverage and consequent model abilities , it remains difficult to establish how often the physical coupling of one event with another impacts coronal evolution .",
    "the importance for flare / eruption forecasting and thereby space - weather forecasting therefore remains unquantified .",
    "the evidence presented in this study motivates development of advanced capabilities and further study of the available data sets . over the years , mhd and pfss field models ( see , e.g. ,",
    "* for a comparison between these ) have demonstrated that the largest - scale coronal configuration is represented fairly well : coronal hole boundaries and even their dynamics are approximated fairly well by open field regions in global pfss models @xcite , solar wind models based on series of pfss models are reasonable approximations of the quiescent solar wind particularly in view of our limited observational coverage of the solar surface magnetic field @xcite , coronal streamers modeled for eclipses approximate some of the observed ones well , and even a fly - through of comet lovejoy shows reasonable agreement with an mhd model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "each of these tests of our understanding of the large - scale coronal structure and its evolution exhibits substantial mismatches ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for discussions of these aspects ) : modeled open - field regions do differ substantially from observed coronal - hole outlines , solar wind predictions are far from perfect in both speed and field polarity , the model streamer structures do not always reflect the directions of observed streamers differ while some observed helmet structures are missed altogether , the tail dynamics of comet lovejoy suggests mismatches in field patterns of at least several degrees , and even the evolution of the sun s open flux over time remains unexplained to within a range of a factor of at least two . all of these mismatches are likely caused by a mixture of the incomplete knowledge of the surface magnetic field , the evolving patterns of the coronal electromagnetic field that continually evolves following flux emergence and decay as well as eruptive events , and of assumptions and approximations made in the modeling .",
    "numerical experiments can help us understand the relative weighting of the impacts of observational and modeling limitations , but ultimately sustained observations from perspectives well away from the sun - earth line , of the high corona , and of the details of current buildup and disappearance are essential in making the next leap forward in understanding the corona and the space weather that it drives .",
