    "many - body systems show incoherent , single - particle - motion , as well as coherent collective motion .",
    "historically this phenomenon received much attention in nuclear physics where there is a wealth of data providing information on the coexistence of collective excitations , such as the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , and single particle excitations @xcite .",
    "there is also strong experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence that similar effects occur in fermionic systems different from atomic nuclei .",
    "other examples for collective motion are vortex - generating rotations and oscillations in bose - einstein condensates @xcite",
    ". furthermore collective behavior can also be present in confined systems such as quantum dots @xcite .",
    "coherent , collective motion emerges out of incoherent , single - particle motion whenever favored by energy conditions .",
    "statistical analysis of spectra in nuclei indicates that chaotic fluctuations are due to single - particle motion , while collective motion is predominantly regular , for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and more recent results in refs  @xcite .",
    "this generic occurrence and the coexistence of the two forms of motion pose a fundamental challenge . strictly speaking , in a generic many - body system",
    "there is not an _ a priori _ separation of the collective motion from the single - particle dynamics . taking the three - dimensional boltzmann gas with hard - wall interactions as an example",
    ", one observes that the dynamics in the phase space of the system is completely chaotic @xcite .",
    "still , we know that the system exhibits regular collective motion in the form of sound waves .",
    "the deep and fascinating question in this context is therefore to understand from first principles how the regular motion emerges out of the full phase space chaos @xcite .    whenever collective dynamics arises on the classical level one might expect on the basis of quantum - classical correspondence that this phenomena should be reflected in the spectral properties of the corresponding quantum many - body hamiltonian .",
    "one way to probe the existence of collective excitations is to couple the system to a weak external periodic potential @xmath0 depending on a collective mode @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of a collective excitation can then be usually registered as a spike at certain energies in the distribution of the transition strengths @xmath2 between the ground and other states of the system .",
    "such a large peak can be observed , for instance , in the cross section of electric dipole radiation in atomic nuclei at high excitation energies , when the gdr is excited . on a phenomenological level",
    "one can obtain such a distribution of the transition strengths from a doorway - type of hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath3 here , the first term describes @xmath4 collective states @xmath5 with energies @xmath6 , the second term describes the environment of single particle states @xmath7 with @xmath8 typically modeled by a random matrix .",
    "the last term models the interaction @xmath9 between collective and single - particle excitations .",
    "the collective states act as doorways into the other levels of the system .",
    "a recent discussion can be found in ref .",
    "although successful in the qualitative description of collective excitation in nuclei , this model does not provide any explanation of the physical reasons that lead to the collective behavior .",
    "we notice that the collective and single - particle excitations are separated here from the start , while collectivity is in fact an emergent phenomena .    having a classical hamiltonian",
    "whose dynamics exhibits collective motion , what can be stated about the distribution of the transition strengths @xmath2 for the corresponding quantum problem ?",
    "in particular , it makes sense to ask under what conditions it is possible to use models like ( [ doorway ] ) and how the parameters there are related to the classical problem .",
    "it is also of considerable interest to understand the role of chaos in this context @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present we are lacking a genuine  semiclassical theory \" for the emergence of collective excitations which would allow us to tackle the problem starting from the corresponding classical dynamics .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to provide answers to some of the questions posed above in the framework of a simple integrable model of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the integrability of the system simplifies the treatment immensely .",
    "it allows for a clear identification of a collective coordinate @xmath1 and an investigation of its dynamical evolution employing an analogy with the caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "after we fix the collective coordinate the remaining degrees of freedom are considered as a bath which is internal , not external as in standard models of the caldeira - leggett - type @xcite . as a result , it turns out that the time evolution of @xmath10 is fully governed by the equation of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator of some frequency @xmath11 determined by the parameters of the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "after this we show that under certain conditions on the hamiltonian of the system the averaged distribution of @xmath2 is directly connected to the corresponding classical problem for time evolution of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the distribution of the transition strengths @xmath2 exhibit spikes at energies @xmath12 which are close to the energies @xmath13  where @xmath14 is the ground state energy  of the collective oscillations , while the width of these spikes is controlled by the classical decay rate @xmath15 of these oscillations . even though the considered model does not involve chaotic features it serves as a testing ground to address the emergence of collective dynamics in a many - body system . furthermore , it allows to see the effect of the absence of dynamical chaos on the distribution of @xmath2 and set up the ground for future investigations .",

    "[ sec21 ]    we consider two identical chains of one - dimensional coupled harmonic oscillators each consisting of @xmath16 particles with positions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and momenta @xmath19 , @xmath18 as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "this implies that for uncoupled chains the non - interacting degrees of freedom are phonons .    after introducing the coupling between the two chains",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system becomes @xmath34 where the interaction term @xmath35 is determined by positive symmetric coupling constants @xmath36 . in what follows",

    "this guarantees that the motion of the whole system remains bounded for all times .",
    "we notice that we do not make a similar requirement for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ collectivecoordinate ]    in what follows we study the dynamics of the collective coordinate @xmath1 defined as the difference between the center of masses of two chains scaled with the factor @xmath40 @xmath41 to this end we map the general problem ( [ hamiltonian ] ) of two coupled chains of harmonic oscillators to a model of caldeira - leggett type , where @xmath1 is coupled to the  bath \" provided by the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "this formulation provides an intuitive description for the dynamics of the collective coordinate in the process of transferring energy from @xmath1 to the bath coordinates .",
    "such an interpretation , however , has to be used carefully because the energy transfer happens inside the full system and a precise definition of the bath depends not only on the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , but also on the choice of the collective coordinate .    as a first step ,",
    "we introduce the new set of canonical coordinates and momenta @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 become diagonal @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the elements of the matrix @xmath47 that diagonalizes @xmath48 @xmath49 for the translational invariant matrix @xmath48 used in this model the diagonalization matrix @xmath47 is given by @xcite @xmath50 with indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we now express the interaction part of the two chains in the new coordinates .",
    "for the first term in equation  ( [ potential ] ) we obtain @xmath53 where we introduced @xmath54 . treating the second term in equation  ( [ potential ] ) in an analogous way we obtain for the interaction part of the hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 are vectors with components @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the matrices defined by @xmath60with @xmath61 . furthermore , after transforming the coordinates and momenta according to @xmath62 and defining @xmath63 , @xmath64",

    "we emphasize again that contrary to the caldeira - legget model the bath is part of the system and not an external configuration of particles .",
    "the damping of the collective motion is a result of a redistribution of energy and not an actual loss of energy as in models with an external bath .",
    "furthermore , our model possesses only a finite number of degrees of freedom which eventually causes a return of energy into the collective mode .",
    "this recurrence time will be much longer , however , than the spreading time for sufficiently large number of particles .",

    "diagonalization of the bath leads to @xmath101 with the coupling coefficients @xmath102 where the implicit equation @xmath103 yields the eigenfrequencies @xmath104 .",
    "[ sec4 ]    we return to the general case .",
    "so far we mapped the hamiltonian system of two coupled chains of harmonic oscillators to the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "the next step is to consider the time evolution of the collective mode @xmath10 induced by the hamiltonian ( [ thehamiltonian ] ) . the full quantum mechanical solution of the problem would require calculating the time evolution for a reduced density - matrix @xmath105 of the collective coordinate . while such an analysis is certainly possible along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , for our purposes it will be sufficient to consider the most basic collective dynamical properties captured by the time evolution of the expectation value for the quantized collective observable @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the full density matrix . in this case the problem simplifies , since one can deduce the time evolution equation for @xmath109 from the corresponding equation for the time evolution of the quantum operator @xmath110 @xcite .",

    "we further rewrite the part describing the dissipation as @xmath124 where we defined the damping - kernel as @xmath125 after inserting this term into equation  ( [ intermeq ] ) we arrive at @xmath126 we now use equation ( [ qevolution ] ) to obtain the evolution equation for the expectation value ( [ expectx ] ) of @xmath1 for some class of initial states @xmath108 .",

    "we have now a formal expression for the spectral density of our general model .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first the collective coordinate becomes completely decoupled from the bath if and only if @xmath163 .",
    "since the components of @xmath84 can be written as @xmath164 the above condition is equivalent to the requirement that the @xmath165 take the same value for all @xmath166 . in particular , there is no damping if @xmath167 .",
    "we notice that given a splitting of the interactions : @xmath168 into  constant \" and  fluctuating \" parts of the interaction , only @xmath169 contributes to @xmath84 .",
    "second , by adding the term @xmath170 to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) one can adjust the collective frequency @xmath171 without changing the spectral density @xmath150 .",
    "this additional term can be incorporated into @xmath172 , @xmath173 such that the overall structural form of @xmath70 remains intact .",
    "note that this  renormalization \" results in a shift of the spectrum @xmath174 of the chain hamiltonians @xmath175 which is compensated by the shift of the interaction term @xmath160 by a diagonal matrix , such that the matrix @xmath75 ( resp .",
    "@xmath150 ) does not change .",
    "the form ( [ densityexpression ] ) for the density @xmath150 hinders an exact treatment for a general form of interaction matrix @xmath176 .",
    "however , if we assume that the fluctuation part of couplings matrix elements are small @xmath177 , we can approximate the density function by @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the phononic spectrum of the noninteracting chains and the @xmath180 s are determined solely by @xmath169 . the expression ( [ sigexp ] ) can be interpreted to the extent that after introducing the interaction between the two chains the phonons acquire a  mass \" .",
    "assuming that @xmath180 are uniformly distributed , the behavior of @xmath148 is determined by the spectral density of the phonon frequencies @xmath181 . in particular , in the case of an ohmic law distribution for the @xmath181 this leads to @xmath182 at low frequencies .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath183 this in turn implies that @xmath136 is localized at @xmath141 and equation  ( [ expectationeq ] ) can be approximated by the differential equation describing time evolution of a harmonic oscillator with a friction .",
    "[ sec6 ]    in the previous section , we derived an equation of motion that describes the damping of the collective excitation . as we mentioned already , the quantum evolution governed by equation  ( [ expectationeq ] ) coincides with the classical evolution of @xmath10 if the initial conditions are defined in an appropriate way . in this section",
    "we consider the problem of existence of quantum collective states in the spectrum of the system .",
    "one way to probe such collective excitations is to couple the system to an external weak periodic potential @xmath184 depending on the collective variable @xmath1 . assuming that the coupling is weak , the energy absorption rate in the first order perturbation theory will be determined by the following spectral function @xmath185 with @xmath186 being the transition strengths between the ground state with energy @xmath14 and @xmath187-th state with energy @xmath12 .",
    "the collective states can then be defined , as states having large transition strengths @xmath188 .",
    "accordingly , the spectral function ( [ specfunc ] ) keeps the information about the existence of collective modes in the system .",

    "we clearly see that the information on the distribution of the transition strengths is stored in the damping kernel @xmath136 of the purely classical equation for the time evolution of the collective mode .",
    "one should note , however , that @xmath235 is not a smooth function but a sum of distributions with wildly fluctuating strength .",
    "it is easy to see , for instance , that most of the states are actually not coupled at all to the ground state through the operator @xmath106 .",

    "the spikes at the bottom of the figure schematically depict the states which are coupled to the ground state through the operator @xmath106 and @xmath260 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for @xmath271 ( i.e. , strongly underdamped regime ) one can clearly see a spike in the vicinity of the oscillator frequency @xmath272 with the width of the spike being twice the width of @xmath212 for the same parameters @xmath135 , @xmath11 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the above discussion to generic observables of the form @xmath190 using the taylor expansion @xmath273 after substituting this into the definition of the time correlator , and applying wick s thorem to the products of @xmath10 we obtain @xmath274 where @xmath275 are some coeficients having dimension of inverse length in power @xmath276 .",
    "taking now the fourier transform from both sides of this expression we obtain for the spectral function @xmath277 where the symbol @xmath278 stands for the convolution .",
    "it is quickly seen that , in the underdamped regime , the @xmath187-th term of the sum ( [ specfgeneral ] ) has a maximum at the vicinity of @xmath279 with a width given by @xmath280 .",
    "we studied collective behavior in an integrable model consisting of two coupled chains of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we chose the rescaled difference of the center of mass modes of the chains as a collective coordinate @xmath1 , and mapped our system onto a model of caldeira - leggett type .",
    "the resemblance with the well - known caldeira - leggett model provides an intuitive physical picture of the energy exchange between the collective coordinate and the remaining degrees of freedom playing the role of the internal bath . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of the collective mode is described by the damped harmonic oscillator equation .",
    "we then relate this dynamical equation to the problem of the existence of collective quantum excitations in the spectrum of the corresponding quantum hamiltonian .",
    "these collective excitations are probed through the transition strengths induced by observables @xmath190 , depending on the collective coordinate .",
    "as we show , for the dynamically underdamped regime the spikes in the distribution of the transition strengths appear precisely at the energies @xmath281 ( @xmath282 ) of the quantized collective harmonic oscillator , while the width of the spikes is controled by the damping coeficient @xmath135 of the corresponding dynamical problem .",
    "it is worth mentioning that based on fluctuation - dissipation type of arguments we can extend the present approach to any hamiltonian system with quadratic interactions .",
    "one of the important features of our model is the freedom of choice for the collective coordinate .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath1 in a technical sense was somewhat arbitrary . in principle",
    ", we could take any linear combination @xmath283 as a collective coordinate , and implement the same type of mapping procedure ( as in the case of @xmath1 ) onto the model of caldeira - legget type .",
    "we would get then precisely the same equation of motion for @xmath284 , but with a different collective frequency @xmath11 and damping kernel @xmath136 .",
    "not every choice for @xmath285 would be , of course , appropriate in order to regard it as a collective coordinate . if , for instance , the resulting dynamics becomes overdamped , no clear spikes will be visible at the corresponding spectral function .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that there exists no  unique \" choice for the collective coordinate .",
    "this means the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath135 are not intrinsic properties of the considered integrable model but are rather affected by the definition of the collective coordinate .",
    "it would be of a great interest to see whether and in what form the above  semiclassical \" connection between the classical dynamics of a collective mode and collective excitations of the corresponding quantum problem can be extended to a more general class of non - integrable systems .",
    "it is clear that some substantial differences with an integrable case must arrise when the dynamics of the system becomes chaotic .",
