    "all but one of the detected extragalactic very high energy ( vhe ) gamma ( @xmath4 ) ray sources so far are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) of the bl  lac type .",
    "these objects are characterized by a highly variable electromagnetic emission ranging from radio to @xmath4-rays , and by continuum spectra dominated by non - thermal emission that consist of two distinct broad components . while the low energy bump is thought to arise dominantly from synchrotron emission of electrons , the origin of the high - energy bump",
    "is still debated .",
    "leptonic models ascribe it to inverse compton processes that either up - scatter synchrotron photons ( synchrotron - self compton [ ssc ] models , marscher & gear 1985 , maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ) , or to external photons that originate from the accretion disk @xcite , from nearby massive stars , or are reflected into the jet by surrounding material @xcite . in hadronic models , interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter @xcite ,",
    "proton - induced cascades @xcite , synchrotron radiation off protons ( proton synchrotron blazar ; aharonian 2000 ; mcke & protheroe 2001 ) , or curvature radiation , are responsible for the high energy photons .",
    "the prime scientific interest in bl  lac objects is twofold : ( 1 ) to understand the vhe @xmath4-ray production mechanisms , assumed to be linked to the massive black hole in the center of the agn , and ( 2 ) to use the vhe @xmath4-rays as a probe of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) spectrum between about @xmath5 to @xmath6 wavelength . in the past ,",
    "most of the vhe @xmath4-ray emitting agn were discovered during phases of high activity , biasing our current observational record towards high emission states .",
    "although these sources also show variability in the x - ray , optical , and radio domain , the vhe variability is observed to often be the most intense and violent one . while fast variability on the timescale of 10 minutes has been observed for mkn  501 in the x - ray domain @xcite , flux doubling times well below 5 minutes were recently also found in the vhe domain @xcite .",
    "many of the observed agn are presumably visible only during a state of high activity .",
    "it still remains an open question whether these sources are only temporarily active and are completely inactive between times of flaring , or if there also exists a state of low but continuous @xmath4-ray emission .",
    "in addition , the temporal and spectral properties of such a low vhe @xmath4-ray emission state is mostly elusive as of to date",
    ". it is quite conceivable that , compared to a low state , the flare emission state is either due to a different population of accelerated particles or originates from a different region in the agn , or both .    in the first year of operation of the major atmospheric gamma imaging cerenkov ( magic )",
    "telescope a program has been started to search for new low and medium redshift blazars emitting at vhe @xmath4-rays ( albert et al . 2006b ; 2006c ; 2007a ) .",
    "in addition , known vhe agns were monitored in order to study common features of their @xmath4-ray emission , as well as the properties of the low - emission state ( albert et al . 2006a ; 2007b ; 2007c ) .",
    "a good candidate for detailed studies is 1es2344 + 514 .",
    "this agn belongs to a type of blazars in which the synchrotron emission peaks at uv / x - ray frequencies ( the so - called high - energy peak bl lacs [ hbls ] e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , as opposed to the blazars with the synchrotron peak located at ir / visible frequencies . along with mkn501 and h1426 + 428 , it represents extreme bl lac objects , in which the synchrotron peak energy exceeds 10  kev , in particular during strong flares @xcite . 1es2344 + 514 was detected during the _ einstein _ slew survey @xcite in the energy range between 0.2 and 4 kev .",
    "it was identified as a bl  lac object by @xcite , who also determined a redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "its black hole mass was estimated to be @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "early _ bepposax _ observations @xcite revealed a large 0.1@xmath910 kev flux variability on timescales of a few hours .",
    "follow - up observations in 1998 found the object in a very low state with the synchrotron peak shifted by a factor of 20 towards lower energies and the corresponding integral flux decreased by a factor of 4.5 .",
    "@xcite interpreted the observations with one electron population being responsible for the steady low energy synchrotron emission and another electron component producing higher energy x - rays with high time variability .",
    "the latter component should be responsible for vhe @xmath4-ray emission via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "egret did not detect any signal from 1es2344 + 514 , giving an upper limit of @xmath10 at its peak response energy of 300  mev @xcite . during the winter of 1995/1996 ,",
    "the whipple collaboration reported a @xmath11 excess signal from 1es2344 + 514 above 350 gev from 20.5 hours observation time @xcite . the observed flux was highly variable , with the most significant signal occurring during a flare on 1995 december 20 , while all the remaining data combined led to an only marginal ( @xmath12 ) excess , i.e. below the canonical detection limit used in ground - based vhe @xmath4-ray astronomy .",
    "the 0.8@xmath912.6 tev differential spectrum measured by the whipple collaboration during the flare had a power - law index of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "one year later another search did not reveal any vhe @xmath4-ray emission .",
    "the hegra collaboration also searched for vhe @xmath4-ray emission above 800 gev .",
    "a deep exposure of 72.5  h indicated a signal at a significance level of @xmath14 @xcite .    here",
    "we present magic telescope observations of 1es2344 + 514 .",
    "we briefly discuss the observational technique used and the implemented data analysis procedure , derive a vhe @xmath4-ray spectrum of the source , and put the results into perspective with other vhe @xmath4-ray observations of this agn . an ssc model is used to describe the wide - range spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the observations were performed between 2005 august 3 and 2005 september 29 , and between 2005 november 11 and 2006 january 1 , using the magic telescope on the canary island of la palma ( @xmath15n , @xmath16w , 2200  m above sea level ) , from where 1es2344 + 514 can be observed at zenith distances above @xmath17 .",
    "the essential parameters of the currently largest air cherenkov telescope are a 17  m    segmented mirror of parabolic shape , an @xmath18 of 1.05 and a hexagonally shaped camera with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath19 mean diameter .",
    "the camera comprises 576 pixels composed of hemispherical , six dynode photomultipliers augmented in sensitivity by a diffuse lacquer doped with a wavelength shifter @xcite and by so - called light catchers . in separate measurements a total gain of 2 has been determined .",
    "180 pixels of @xmath20    surround the inner section of the camera , which consists of 394 pixels of @xmath21    ( @xmath22    fov ) .",
    "the trigger is formed by a coincidence of @xmath23 neighboring pixels .",
    "the overall cherenkov photon ( @xmath24  nm ) to photoelectron conversion ratio is @xmath25 .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the main mirror is @xmath26 , while 90% of the light of a source at infinity is focussed onto a disk with @xmath21   .",
    "further details of the telescope parameters and performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "1es2344 + 514 was observed for 32 hours in total , distributed over 27 days between 2005 august and the first days of 2006 january at zenith angles ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the observations were carried out in wobble mode @xcite , i.e. by alternatingly tracking two positions at @xmath29 offset from the camera center .",
    "this observation mode allows a reliable background estimation for point sources .",
    "simultaneous @xmath30-band observations of 1es2344 + 514 were conducted in the framework of the tuorla observatory blazar monitoring program with the kva 35  cm telescope on la palma and the 1.03  m telescope at tuorla observatory , finland .",
    "the data analysis was carried out using the standard magic analysis and reconstruction software @xcite . after calibration @xcite",
    ", the images were cleaned by requiring a minimum number of seven photoelectrons ( core pixels ) and five photoelectrons ( boundary pixels ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "these tail cuts are scaled accordingly for the larger size of the outer pixels of the magic camera .",
    "the data were filtered by rejecting trivial background events , such as accidental noise triggers , triggers from nearby muons or data taken during adverse conditions ( low atmospheric transmission , car light flashes etc . ) .",
    "light clusters , either from large angle shower particles or from the night sky light background ( stars ) , well separated from the main image , were removed from the images . for the events included in the analysis ,",
    "the mean trigger rate was required to be constant within @xmath31 . in order to improve the comparability of the two data sets from summer and winter 2005 we restricted the maximum zenith angle to @xmath32 . from the remaining events , corresponding to 23.1 h observation time , image parameters were calculated @xcite such as width , length , size , conc , and m3long , the third moment of the light distribution along the major image axis . for the @xmath4/hadron separation a multidimensional classification procedure based on the random forest method",
    "was employed @xcite .",
    "the separation procedure was trained using a sample of monte carlo ( mc ) generated @xmath4-ray shower images @xcite on the one hand and about 1% randomly selected events from the measured wobble data representing the hadronic background on the other hand .",
    "the mc @xmath4-ray showers were generated between zenith angles of 24@xmath33 and 34@xmath33 with energies between 10  gev and 30  tev .",
    "every event was assigned a parameter called hadronness ( @xmath34 ) , which is a measure for the probability that it is a hadronic ( background ) event .",
