    "the advances on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) and on semi - conductor quantum electrodynamics ( scqed ) , reached in the last three decades , allowed developing devices that approach the predictions of the quantum theory of the matter - radiation interaction to the experimental results . in this context , the manipulation of the quantum states of light is a subject of growing interest , with topics as the production of only - one photon sources @xcite , the analysis of the quantum interference mechanisms like the schrdinger cat states of light @xcite and those derived from the matter - radiation interaction @xcite for instance .",
    "they are promising topics for technological applications in quantum computation and information processing @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum opto - electronic system @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in spite of the accepted quantum nature of topics as the schrdinger cat states , a classical approach to them seems to be possible by adding novel considerations to the phase - space representation of the optical wave - field , like the spatial coherence wavelets emitted by both radiant and virtual point sources @xcite .",
    "it could revaluate the actual limits of the classical theories and the real grounds of the physical behavior of light .",
    "for instance , the analysis presented in this paper suggest that the schrdinger cat states are actually originated by the spatial coherence state of the light .",
    "+ the more recent description of the properties and behavior of optical fields in arbitrary state of spatial coherence has been proposed in the framework of their phase - space representation @xcite . in this context , the spatial coherence wavelets and the marginal power spectrum @xcite have been introduced as field descriptors , in such a way that the propagation of power and correlation features of the field is depicted in terms of wavelets emitted by source pairs gathered in classes determined by the pair separations @xcite . +",
    "this description is compatible to the second order spatial coherence theory of the optical field @xcite , and provides new insight about the interference and the diffraction phenomena , as discussed in the present work .",
    "for instance , the marginal power spectrum provides a ray - map with two kinds of rays , i.e._the carrier rays _ along which the radiant energy of the field is transported , and the _ modulating @xmath0 rays _ which propagate positive and negative energies , responsible for the interference phenomenon @xcite . additionally to the conventional geometrical definition of the rays @xcite , the carrier rays are radiometric quantities , whose energy does not depend on the spatial coherence state of the field but it is recordable by squared modulus detectors , while the positive and negative energies associated to the modulating @xmath0 rays are determined by the spatial coherence state of the field but they are not detectable by such type of detectors , i.e. their existence is inferred from the redistribution of the power across the interference and the diffraction patterns @xcite .",
    "+ carrier and modulating @xmath0 rays are emitted by two sets of point sources of different nature@xcite , i.e. _ radiant point sources _ for the first kind of rays , and _ virtual point sources _ responsible for the non - recordable modulating @xmath0 rays .",
    "these sets of point sources are optically disjoint , so that they can be regarded as allocated over two distinct layers of the space , which eventually are bringing together onto the same plane in specific arrangements . in such cases ,",
    "dual point sources are induced by the coincidence of radiant and virtual sources at the same point on the plane .",
    "the union of the sets of radiant and virtual point sources provides a unified structure of point sources for the field .",
    "consequently , carrier and modulating @xmath0 rays emitted by the dual sources share the same paths in space . +",
    "this model is successfully applied in the description of diffraction of light with arbitrary states of spatial coherence and the young s experiment with diffraction effects @xcite .",
    "two potential uses make it attractive , i.e. the developing of the robust simulation algorithms and of new strategies for optical information processing based on the manipulation of the virtual sources of the second layer of the space , instead of the radiant sources of the first layer as conventional",
    ". both uses will be explored in next papers .",
    "furthermore , this model reveals some unexpected features of the field , morphologically similar to the quantum squeezed states and the schrdinger cat states , without appealing to explicit quantum constrains .",
    "let us suppose a stationary scalar wave field in any state of spatial coherence , on propagation between the aperture plane ( ap ) and the observation plane ( op ) , at a distance @xmath1 to each other in the fresnel - fraunhofer domain .",
    "let us assume that the centre and difference coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 univocally specify the positions of any pair of points at the ap and the op respectively , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the phase space representation of this field is provided by the spatial coherence wavelets @xcite , denoted as    @xmath6     + where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the wavelength of the field , and    @xmath9     + is a wigner distribution function with energy units , called the marginal power spectrum @xcite , with    @xmath10     + the cross - spectral density @xcite of the field at the ap , @xmath11 $ ] the complex degree of spatial coherence @xcite , @xmath12 the power distribution of the field at the ap and @xmath13 $ ] the complex transmission of this plane .",
    "the marginal power spectrum provides the phase - space diagram or ray - map of the scalar wave field in any state of spatial coherence @xcite .",
    "+ the superposition of the spatial coherence wavelets yields the cross - spectral density of the field at the op @xcite , i.e.    @xmath14     + whose evaluation for @xmath15 is the power spectrum recorded at this plane , i.e.    @xmath16     + because of the definition of the marginal power spectrum in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , the superposition of spatial coherence wavelets in equation ( [ eq4a ] ) can explain the interference and diffraction phenomena of light , which are close related to the lowest order of spatial coherence and are observed as modulations on the power spectrum in equation ( [ eq4b ] ) recorded at the op @xcite .",
    "however , it is not enough to predict phenomena due to spatial coherence properties of higher order .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless function @xmath17 $ ] @xcite with @xmath18 the dirac s delta and @xmath19 a constant that assures the dimensionless character of the function and the accomplishment of the conservation law of the total energy , into the integral in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) in order to express the marginal power spectrum as @xmath20 , with    @xmath21     + and    @xmath22     + where equation ( [ eq3 ] ) was taken into account with @xmath23 the power distribution that emerges from the ap , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the cosine function in equation ( [ eq5b ] ) results from considering the two degrees of freedom in direction of each separation vector @xmath26 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath27 determine the flux of radiant energy provided by each individual centre of secondary disturbance at the ap onto any point at the op , while @xmath28 determines positive and negative energies due to the correlation between the pairs of centres of secondary disturbance , placed within the spatial coherence support centred at @xmath29 on the ap , onto any point at the op . the term _ structured spatial coherence support _ denotes the region around any point on the ap determined by the spatial coherence state of the wave , where pairs of emitters are included depending on specific correlation properties established in detail in @xcite .",
    "the positive and negative energies of @xmath28 can not be interpreted as a radiant flux @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they play a crucial role in describing interference and diffraction from the point of view of the energy transport between the ap and the op @xcite .",
    "indeed , equations ( [ eq4b]),([eq5a ] ) and ( [ eq5b ] ) yield the power spectrum at any point on the op , i.e.    @xmath30d^{2}\\xi_{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + with @xmath31 the radiant power provided by the individual centres of secondary disturbance , and @xmath32 the modulating power , which can take on positive and negative values , and therefore has a different physical meaning as the radiant power . the condition @xmath33 imposes @xmath34 , and therefore @xmath35 stands , i.e. @xmath32 modulates @xmath36 determining the power spectrum at any point of the op , a behavior presented in interference and diffraction light .",
    "furthermore , the conservation law of the total energy of the field can be expressed of as @xcite    @xmath37     + where    @xmath38d^{2}r_{a } \\nonumber\\\\\\hspace{0.3cm}= \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda z}\\right)\\int_{op}\\int_{ap}[\\textsf{\\textbf{s}}_{ind}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{a},\\mathbf{r}_{a})+\\textsf{\\textbf{s}}_{pairs } ( \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{a},\\mathbf{r}_{a } ) ] d^{2}\\xi_{a}d^{2}r_{a},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + with    @xmath39     + and    @xmath40     + equations ( [ eq8b ] ) and ( [ eq8c ] ) imply that @xmath41 and    @xmath42     + accordingly , the modulating power @xmath32 is not recordable by squared modulus detectors placed at the op , but its modulation effects are revealed as a redistribution of the radiant power emitted at the ap onto the op .",
    "this is the meaning of interference and diffraction from the point of view of the energy transport between the ap and the op @xcite .",
    "+ the results above suggest that an optical field in any state of spatial coherence can be thought as emitted by the following types of point sources , placed at positions @xmath29 on two distinct layers of the ordinary space , as conceptually depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] :    * _ radiant emitters",
    "_ gathered on the first layer , which are responsible for the emission of the radiant energy of the field , i.e. the energy which is recorded by detectors at the op .",
    "they are pure individual sources in the sense that their emissions , described by equation ( [ eq5a ] ) , do not depend from correlations with neighbour emitters . +    * _ virtual emitters",
    "_ gathered on the second layer , they emit the positive and negative modulating energies .",
    "they are virtual in the sense that their contributions are not directly recordable by square modulus detectors but through the redistribution of the power spectrum at the op that they produce . for such detectors",
    ", the second layer is actually vacuumed .",
    "the emission of the point virtual emitters is described by equation ( [ eq5b ] ) and depends on the correlation between all the pairs of centres of secondary disturbance placed within the spatial coherence support centred at the position of the corresponding point virtual emitter .    in this two - layer structure of the ordinary space , two correlated radiant emitters of the first layer turn on a virtual emitter in the second layer , located in the middle point of the distance between them . a consequence :    * the distribution of radiant emitters on the first layer must be discrete , even regarding the set of maximal density of such emitters , because there should be place between consecutive correlated radiant emitters for allocating the turned - on virtual ones . *",
    "in contrast , the set of maximal density of virtual emitters of a scalar wave field approaches to continuum by the lowest - order of spatial coherence .",
    "* only radiant emitters will be placed just at the edge of apertures at the ap . *",
    "radiant and virtual emitters can be placed at the same positions @xmath29 of the ordinary space ( although in separate layers ) if the correlation extends beyond the consecutive pairs .",
    "* the strengths provided by all the radiant sources are identical , except if the diffracted wavefront is no uniform at the ap ; while those provided by the virtual sources depend of the size of the corresponding supports ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) , because each virtual source emits the addition of the contributions due to all the pairs of secondary disturbance within its support .",
    "so , only the virtual sources associated to supports of the same shape and size emit the same strength .",
    "thus , the complete distribution of radiant and virtual point sources of the scalar wave field will be obtained when projecting the two layers of the space onto the same plane , as depicted in [ fig1 ] .",
    "such distribution will contain a further type of point sources , i.e. _ dual emitters _",
    "conformed by radiant and virtual point sources placed at the same position .     in arbitrary units )",
    "in which the number of pairs within any support diminish and the diminishing rate .",
    "there are no pairs within the support centred at the surrounding of the aperture edge no matter the spatial coherence state of the field.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    from this point of view , fully spatially incoherent scalar wave fields propagate only through the first layer of the ordinary space and are emitted only by radiant point sources ( i.e. such field are unable to turn on virtual sources , and therefore they neither contain dual sources ) . partially ( or completely ) spatial coherent fields use the both layers of the ordinary space in their propagation , because they are emitted by both the radiant and the virtual point sources ( and then , by virtual emitters ) .",
    "+ such structure of radiant and virtual point sources for the optical field , distributed onto two different layers of the ordinary space constitutes a novel description of the spatial coherence properties of the lowest - order of the field .",
    "it allows understanding the diffraction and interference of scalar optical fields in any state of spatial coherence not as a result of geometrical features ( i.e. the effect of the aperture edges at the ap and the phase difference between superimposed wavefronts at the op respectively ) but as a result of the same radiative feature , i.e. the emission of positive and negative modulating energies by virtual point emitters distributed within the whole aperture at the ap .",
    "it is one - dimensionally performed by arranging a double slit mask at the ap , whose parameters are depicted in fig . [ fig3 ] . for mathematical simplicity and without lack of generality ,",
    "let us assume diffraction of an uniform scalar wave field in fraunhofer domain by each slit , i.e. negligible phase term @xmath43 and constant power @xmath44 over the slits .",
    "the ray - map for this experiment can be expressed as @xmath45 , with"
