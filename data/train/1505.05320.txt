    "a well - known instability of toroidal fields is the magneto hydrodynamical pinch - type current - driven instability which is basically nonaxisymmetric@xcite .",
    "the toroidal field becomes unstable if a certain magnetic field amplitude is exceeded depending on the radial profile of the field which forms the electric - current pattern .",
    "it is also known that for unity magnetic prandtl number a global rotation of the system increases the critical field amplitude .",
    "the latter is strongly reduced , however , if the rotation decreases outwards ( i.e. @xmath6 , ` sub - rotation ' ) .",
    "the formal reason is that sub - rotation becomes ( rayleigh- ) unstable even in the hydrodynamic regime if it is steep enough .",
    "more important is the existence of a nonaxisymmetric instability for such rotation laws even for current - free toroidal fields ( @xmath2 ) which we have called azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri@xcite ) .",
    "it appears for all values of the magnetic prandtl number for rather low hartmann numbers but for large magnetic reynolds numbers of the basic rotation .",
    "this phenomenon also explains the general destabilization of toroidal fields by rotation laws with @xmath7 _ decreasing _ outwards .",
    "the question arises about the role of ` super - rotation ' , i.e. rotation laws with @xmath8 , which are linearly stable in the hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear behavior is less clear as some taylor - couette experiments have shown instability in this regime@xcite .",
    "superrotation can not be destabilized by the standard magnetorotational instability with axial external fields .",
    "inspired by the discovery of the axisymmetric helical mri a wkb method for inviscid fluids in current - free helical background fields has been applied providing two limits of instability in terms of the shear in the rotation law@xcite .",
    "an upper threshold suggests a magnetic destabilization of super - rotating flows for very strong positive shear .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been reported by bonanno & urpin ( 2008 ) resulting from a local analysis for a helical field under the influence of super - rotation@xcite .",
    "later it has been shown with a dispersion relation for inductionless fluids ( see the appendix ) that the stability curve does not cross the line representing the differentially rotating pinch formed by uniform electric - current suggesting instability for both signs of shear@xcite .    by means of a corresponding approximation acheson ( 1978 )",
    "showed that for fast - rotation the current - driven instability of toroidal fields may be stabilized by positive shear @xcite .",
    "if this is true we expect in the solar low latitudes where in the bulk of the convection zone the equatorial @xmath7 increases outwards that the toroidal field is stabilized and can be amplified to much higher values than it would be true for the opposite rotation law .",
    "contrary to that a rotation law with negative shear  as it exists in higher solar latitudes  strongly destabilizes the fields so that they can not reach high amplitudes .",
    "it is shown here by use of a simplifying cylinder geometry that indeed for not too small magnetic prandtl numbers super - rotation stabilizes toroidal magnetic fields while sub - rotation strongly destabilizes toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , small magnetic prandtl number and slow rotation of any rotation law  including rigid rotation ",
    "lead to _ lower _ critical magnetic field strengths than needed for destabilization at @xmath9 .",
    "we shall show in the present paper that for @xmath0 and for slow rotation the relaxation of the excitation conditions compared with the resting container belongs to the double - diffusive phenomena which disappear if the the molecular viscosity equals the molecular resistivity .",
    "a taylor - couette container is considered which confines a toroidal magnetic field with amplitudes fixed at the cylinders which may rotate with different rotation rates .",
