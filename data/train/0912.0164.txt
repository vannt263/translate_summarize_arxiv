    "the only way that the light in a high - q mode can escape the cavity is by directly tunneling to the outside continuum .",
    "the output resulting from this is usually very weak .",
    "a strong directional output can be obtained if there exists a chaos - assisted dynamical tunneling process in action : the light in a high - q mode can undergo dynamical tunneling into nearby chaotic sea first and then go through chaotic ray dynamics until it escapes the cavity by ray refraction at particular positions and at particular angles .    quite recently , yang _ et al._@xcite has reported a resonant pumping experiment based on dynamical tunneling from chaotic sea to high - q modes in a deformed microcavity laser .",
    "they introduced a collimated pump beam into the cavity by refraction in a time reversed way with respect to the directional output caused by dynamical tunneling followed by chaotic ray dynamics .",
    "they observed that the pumping efficiency of a high - q lasing mode at a longer wavelength than that of the pump is enhanced by two orders of magnitude whenever the pump is resonant with a high - q cavity mode , which is localized in a regular region in the phase space separated from the chaotic sea . since the pump beam , injected by refraction ,",
    "moves in the chaotic sea , the resonant enhancement must have come from the dynamical tunneling from the chaotic sea to the regular mode .    in this paper",

    "we derive a formula for relative pumping efficiency as a function of pump detuning , coupling constants and decay rates of the involved modes in sec.[sec3 ] .",
    "we show that the pump - excited chaotic modes can be regarded as a single pump mode with an effective decay rate and an effective coupling constant @xmath0 with the regular mode in sec.[sec3c ] .",
    "we also show that the decay rate of the regular mode is enhanced by dynamical tunneling into all chaotic modes .",

    "@xmath11 the equations of motion for envelopes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are basically those of driven coupled oscillators @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant ( assumed real ) between the @xmath4th chaotic mode and the regular mode .",
    "we assume that the chaotic modes are extremely lossy while the coupling of each to the regular mode is so weak that the oscillation between any chaotic mode and the regular mode is over - damped : @xmath14 .",
    "effects of partial barriers @xcite are included in @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "symbol @xmath15 is the coupling coefficient of the external pump laser into the @xmath4th chaotic mode , depending on the position and the incident angle of the pump beam on the cavity boundary , and @xmath16 , the detuning between the pump laser of frequency @xmath17 and the regular mode of frequency @xmath18 .",
    "since each chaotic mode is so broad in linewidth and since we are interested in a small frequency range ( @xmath19 ) around the regular mode , we have neglected a detuning term for the chaotic mode in writing eq ..    th uncoupled low - q chaotic mode of an envelope @xmath20 can be coupled to an uncoupled high - q regular mode of an envelope @xmath21 with a coupling constant @xmath13 ( @xmath22 ) .",
