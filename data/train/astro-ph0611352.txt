    "the data have also been used widely to put constraints on different parametric forms of primordial spectrum , mostly motivated by inflation  @xcite .    however , despite the strong theoretical appeal and simplicity of a featureless primordial spectrum , it is important to determine the shape of the primordial power spectrum directly from observations with minimal theoretical bias .",

    "the primordial power spectrum has been deconvolved directly from the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy measured by wmap using an improved implementation of the richardson - lucy algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of the recovered spectrum is a sharp infra - red cut - off on the horizon scale .",

    "wavelet transforms provide a powerful tool for the analysis of transient and non - stationary data and is particularly useful in picking out characteristic local variations at different resolutions .",

    ", wavelets allow optimal `` time - frequency '' localization simultaneously in the real , as well as , fourier domain .",
    "the vocabulary of dwt stems from applications in one dimensional time - stream signal trains , but has found wide application in signal in other domains and dimensions . specifically in our case , the ` signal ' being transformed is the power spectrum , @xmath7 , a one dimensional function of wavenumber , @xmath3 .",
    "wavelets are an orthonormal basis of small waves , with their variations primarily concentrated in a finite region , which makes them ideal for analyzing localized ` transient ' signals .",
    "wavelets can be continuous or discrete . in the latter case ,",
    "the basis elements are strictly finite in size , enabling them to achieve localization , while disentangling characteristic variations at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "this is the primary reason for us to employ discrete wavelets for our analysis .    in the construction of the basis set for discrete wavelet transform ,",
    "one starts with the scaling function @xmath27 ( father wavelet ) and the mother wavelet @xmath28 , whose height and width are arbitrary : @xmath29 are also square integrable at different resolutions . here ,",

    ", these basis functions form a complete orthonormal set .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that for a discrete data set with a finite number of points @xmath40 the maximum value of @xmath31 is the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath41 .    a signal @xmath42",
    "can then be expanded as @xmath43 here , @xmath44 s are the low - pass coefficients and @xmath45 s are the high - pass or wavelet coefficients , respectively capturing the average part and variations of the signal at resolution @xmath31 and location @xmath30 . in practice ,",
    "for a finite data set one starts with the highest level of resolution and progressively moves to resolution on grosser scales keeping in mind the physics of the problem and the size of the data set .",
    "the lowest level of resolution one chooses then corresponds to @xmath46 and the higher levels correspond to larger values of @xmath31 . for the discrete wavelets ,",
    "the property of multi - resolution analysis ( mra ) leads to @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively the low - pass ( scaling function ) and high - pass ( wavelet ) filter coefficients , which differ for different wavelets .",
    "thus , both low - pass and high - pass coefficients at a resolution @xmath31 can be obtained from the low - pass coefficients at a higher resolution @xmath51 .",
    "the low - pass coefficients @xmath52 are obtained though the convolution of the signal @xmath42 with the scaling function @xmath53 . for a fixed @xmath30 , in the limit @xmath39 ,",
    "the scaling function becomes a dirac delta function and hence the corresponding low - pass coefficient is the signal itself at point @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that , starting from the finest resolution of the signal , one can construct both scaling and wavelet functions , by convolution with the corresponding filter coefficients .",
    "hence one can carry out the wavelet decomposition , as also the inverse transform , with the help of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , without explicitly knowing the basis set . in this respect ,",
    "wavelet transform is significantly different from the fourier transform .    for the haar wavelet , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the haar basis is unique , since it is the only wavelet which is symmetric and compactly supported . in a level one haar wavelet decomposition ,",
    "the level - i low - pass ( average ) and high - pass ( wavelet or detail ) coefficients are respectively given by the nearest neighbor averages and differences , with the normalization factor of @xmath56 .",
    "in the subsequent step , the average coefficients are divided into two parts , containing level - ii high - pass and level - ii low - pass coefficients .",
    "the high - pass coefficients now represent differences of averaged data points corresponding to a window size of two . thus higher level coefficients represent lower frequency features .",
    "wavelets belonging to the daubechies family are designed such that the wavelet coefficients are independent of polynomial trends in the data .",
    "we have carried out a 10-level decomposition using daubechies-4 wavelets for isolating fluctuations at different resolutions .",
    "daubechies-4 wavelet satisfies @xmath57 , in addition to all other conditions . because of this the wavelet coefficients capture fluctuations over and above the linear variations .",
    "simple models of inflation predict that log @xmath7 vs @xmath58 will have a linear relation .",
    "the choice of daubechies-4 wavelets is the _ minimal _ ( simplest ) wavelet that allows us to study variations about linear behavior in a window whose size increases with the level of decomposition .",
    "furthermore , to study the significance of features located at different wavenumbers and at different resolutions , fluctuations associated with wavelet coefficients of different levels are added to the average behavior captured by the low - pass coefficients in order to reconstruct a smoothened power spectrum .",
    "then a likelihood analysis with respect to the wmap data is performed .",
    "if the data set is of size @xmath59 a maximum of @xmath40 level decompositions can be carried out . in the case of fewer data points",
    ", one needs to supplement the data with additional points to carry out an @xmath40 level decomposition . due to the finite size of the filter coefficients ,",
    "one also encounters boundary artifacts due to circular or other forms of extensions . in our case , for minimizing these boundary artifacts , we have carefully padded the data with constants at both ends , which were then removed after reconstruction .",
    "we worked with a data set of 8192 points for log @xmath7 vs @xmath60 recovered from wmap-1 observations .",
    "the data set was arranged to be equally spaced , as required by wavelet programs .     and",
    "@xmath61 show the localized variations due to the wavelet coefficients at the 10th , 9th , 8th , 7th and the 6th levels respectively .",
    "these variations in the primordial power spectrum are most prominent close to the horizon scale and are significant only in the first few panels , corresponding to ` low frequency ' variations .",
    "the panels on the right compare the resultant angular power spectrum , @xmath62 with the binned wmap-1 angular power spectrum data .",
    "going down from the top we progressively add features from different levels of wavelet coefficients ( left ) to the primordial power spectrum and show the difference , @xmath63 and error bars for @xmath64 ( right ) . ]    , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is shown in the middle panel .",
    "the combination of both these panels is shown in the bottom panel .",

    "one of the most challenging questions of the modern cosmology is to find an inflationary scenario satisfying all the cosmological observations .",
    "the shape of the primordial power spectrum has the key role in this investigation . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have used richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm to find the shape of the primordial power spectrum using the cosmic microwave background data .    by using dwt ,",
    "we decompose the recovered primordial power spectrum locally at different resolutions .",
    "we then calculate the angular power spectrum after including the variations in the primordial power spectrum at different resolutions .",
    "we subsequently compute the likelihood of the primordial power spectrum at each of these stages so as to quantify the effect of different features on the recovered angular power spectrum .",
    "we use wmap-1 likelihood code available at the lambda site   and quote our likelihood @xmath71 in terms of @xmath72 .",
