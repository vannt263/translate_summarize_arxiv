    "recently there have been investigations whether a large class of systems with countable infinite number of degrees of freedom described by self - adjoint operators can be used to give a spectral interpretation for the riemann zeros .",
    "the main result we emphasize is that in the formalism of quantum field theory there is no obstruction for the existence of the above mentioned elusive operators .    in this paper",
    "we delve a different point of view aiming to shed some light on this problem .",
    "we consider a large class of two - dimensional field - theory models in euclidean space . we show that the asymptotic behavior of the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function in such models fits the asymptotic distribution of the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function . as an example",
    "we show that the non - linear sigma model in the leading order in @xmath0 expansion presents such a behavior .",
    "although there is in the literature intense activity connecting the riemann zeros , classical and quantum chaos , random matrices and disordered systems , as far as we know the result presented here is discussed for the first time .",
    "the riemann zeta function @xmath1 defined by analytic continuation of a dirichlet series has a simple pole with residue @xmath2 at @xmath3 , trivial zeros at @xmath4 , @xmath5 and complex zeros @xmath6 for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that @xmath8 .",
    "hilbert and plya suggested that a possible way to prove the riemann hypothesis would be to interpret the non - trivial zeros spectrally . in this scenario",
    "one must find a hermitian operator whose eigenvalues are the imaginary part of the non - trivial zeros of the zeta function .    in a series of papers",
    "the hilbert - plya conjecture ( as the above approach became known ) has been studied in the context of quantum field theory . using the construction of the so - called super - zeta or secondary zeta function built over the riemann zeros   @xcite",
    ", it was shown that it is possible to extend the hilbert - plya conjecture to systems with countably infinite number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussed ideas , dueas and svaiter investigated the consequences of the existence of such an operator in a quantum - field - theory framework .",
    "these authors studied a massless scalar field in a @xmath9-dimensional space - time , where one of the coordinates lies in an finite interval @xmath10 $ ] in one direction , assuming that the the non - trivial zeros of the zeta function appears as a subset of the spectrum of the vacuum modes .",
    "the renormalized zero - point energy of this system was presented using an analytic regularization procedure  @xcite .",
    "another route to exploit connections between number theory and quantum theory is known as arithmetic quantum field theory  @xcite . in these theories ,",
    "the partition function of hypothetical systems are related to the riemann zeta function or to more general dirichlet series .",
    "one example of such system is known as the bosonic riemann gas  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was presented a generalization of such a model by assuming an ensemble of hamiltonians of arithmetic bosonic gas with some probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "the singularity structure for the average free energy density of this arithmetic gas in the complex @xmath11 plane was discussed .",
    "the connection between riemann zeros , chaotic systems , disordered systems and random matrices has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the density of the riemann zeros can be written as a trace formula where the role of periodic orbits is played by the sequence of the prime numbers .",
    "for a recent discussion see for example the ref .  .",
    "other important result is the random matrix conjecture which claims that the energy levels of classically chaotic systems are distributed as eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the connection between riemann zeros and random matrices is given by the montgomery - odlyzko law which states that the distribution of spacing between nontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function @xmath1 is statistically identical to the distribution of eigenvalue spacings in a gaussian unitary ensemble @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the result that the statistical asymptotic distribution of the riemann zeros on the critical line coincides with the statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of very large size random unitary matrices .",
    "we briefly mention that non - linear sigma models can be brought to the context of random matrices and systems with disorder .",
    "this is achieved by considering the fact that a gas of fermions in the presence of a random potential can be described by an effective low - energy field theory , which is precisely a non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that random matrix theory appears in an appropriate limit of such a model .",
    "the non - linear sigma model also emerges if we consider the problem of wave propagation in a medium with a correlated spatially varying index of refraction @xcite .",
    "since disorder in wave problems leads us to chaotic systems in the limit of short wavelengths , one has an example in which a link between the riemann zeta zeros and the non - linear sigma model must be investigated .",
    "the organization of the present paper is the following .",
    "we briefly review the connection between riemann zeros and quantum mechanics in section ii .",
    "we discuss the impossibility of extending such a scenario in a straightforward way to systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in section iii we investigate if scalar field - theory models where the loopwise expansion is available can provide some new insights in number - theory questions . in section",
    "iv we show how the non - linear sigma model , defined in a two - dimensional euclidean space in a @xmath0 expansion is connected with the asymptotic distribution of the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "conclusions are given in section v. in this paper we use @xmath12 .",
    "berry and keating conjectured that the hamiltonian h = ( q p + p q ) [ be ] has important connections with the non - trivial riemann zeros  @xcite .",
    "possible modifications and extensions to this interesting scenario were proposed  @xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics ,",
    "such remarkable results are in some sense well understood .",
    "however , it turns out that a simple generalization to quantum field theory leads one to rather suspicious consequences .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "a straightforward extension of the supersymmetric wess - zumino model  @xcite to spaces of dimension @xmath13 leads one to equations of motion of higher order such as ( ^/2 - m^)= 0 , [ susy ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a scalar quantum field . as discussed in ref .",
    ", these equations for any @xmath13 have a tachyonic component .",
    "being more specific , for the case of six dimensions , the above equation can be derived from the second - order lagrangian = ( - m^4 ^ 2 ) , whose associated hamiltonian has a tachyonic contribution .",
    "such a term can be understood as representing a superposition of systems having for each momentum degree of freedom @xmath16 the following hamiltonian h _",
    "= ( q _ p _",
    "+ p _ q _ ) .",
    "[ bol ] for more details see ref .  .",
    "it is easy to see that equation  ( [ bol ] ) is the straightforward generalization of the hamiltonian  ( [ be ] ) to the case of infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads us to a model for tachyon quantization .",
    "as well known , such a model is plagued with many difficulties such as imaginary mass , lack of unitarity , causality issues , etc .",
    "therefore , as long as quantum field theory is concerned , models based on eq .",
    "( [ bol ] ) should be discarded on physical grounds .",
    "a natural question now arises . how can one approach the hilbert - plya conjecture in the context of quantum field theory ? in the next sections we show that there is a connection between the asymptotic distribution of the riemann zeros and two - point schwinger functions of one - loop effective action in quantum field theory .",
    "in this section we digress on the fundamental object through which correlation functions in many models in two - dimensional euclidean scalar field theory relate to the asymptotic distribution of riemann zeros .",
    "we consider massive interacting fields @xmath17 with ( bare ) mass @xmath18 . here",
    "the basic quantity we are interested in is _ [ m]= , [ eff4 ] where @xmath19 is some scalar function with dimensions of mass squared .",
    "whenever a formal perturbative expansion in powers of a suitable parameter is available , the usual feynman diagrams of field theory can be displayed .",
    "in particular ,  ( [ eff4 ] ) generates one - loop diagrams , in particular bubble diagrams .",
    "the quantity  ( [ eff4 ] ) naturally appears in the semi - classical or loopwise expansion of field theory .",
    "as well known , this method amounts to introduce a formal expansion of the functional integral in powers of @xmath20 : z[j ] = where @xmath21 $ ] is a formal product of lebesgue measures at every point of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is an external source and @xmath24 $ ] is the action given by s [ ] = d^2x .",
    "here we regard @xmath25 $ ] as a simple polynomial in @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , notice that one must return with the @xmath20 in front of the action in the functional integral .",
    "we are not going to present the standard derivation since it can be found in many textbooks , see for instance ref .  .",
    "the important point is that , at order @xmath20 one obtains the following expression for the generating functional @xmath26 of proper vertices : = s [ ] + \\{s_[m ] - } , where @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath15 being the classical field , solution of the classical field equations @xmath28/\\delta\\varphi = 0 $ ] . the @xmath29-th functional derivative of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath15 for @xmath30 yields the one - particle irreducible correlation functions of the theory .",
    "let us present one situation where the basic quantity  ( [ eff4 ] ) shows up .",
    "consider a simple model of two euclidean self - interacting scalar fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 with masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath35 .",
    "after the construction of an effective field theory and further imposition of the infinite mass limit for the heavy field , there is a decoupling between the light and heavy modes as stated by the appelquist - carrazzone theorem  @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the model studied in ref .   in two dimensions .",
    "following such a reference , we consider the theory described by the following action with two real scalar fields s[_1 , _ 2 ] & = & d^2x . the precise form of @xmath36 $ ] is not important for the construction of the effective theory , although it is essential in order to consistently implement the decoupling theorem  @xcite .",
    "the partition function is given by z[j_1 , j_2 ] = n , where @xmath37 are external sources and @xmath38 is a normalization .",
    "the above action can be rewritten as s[_1 , _ 2 ] = s_1[_1 ] + s_2[_1 , _ 2 ] , where @xmath39 $ ] is the @xmath40-independent part of the total action . in order to obtain the wilsonian effective action for the light",
    "modes one must assume that @xmath35 . in this way we integrate out the heavy field @xmath40 in the functional integral and define the effective action of the light modes @xmath41 $ ] by e^-_[_1 ] = e^-s_1[_1]e^-s_2[_1 , _ 2 ] by means of a simple gaussian integration , we obtain the following expression for the wilsonian effective action of the light field @xmath31 _ [ _ 1 ] = s_1[_1 ] + _ [ m ] , where @xmath42 .",
    "so we see that @xmath43 here appears as the one - loop contribution to the wilsonian effective action for the light fields .",
    "another example in which eq .",

    "since we are interested in finite theories , a cut - off consistent with the symmetries of the model is implicit .",
    "introduce the field @xmath50 defined by ( x)= and the field @xmath51 which acts as a lagrange multiplier , i.e. 1=dd , where the @xmath52 integration runs parallel to the imaginary axis . using the fields @xmath51 and @xmath50 , and defining the respective functional measures @xmath53",

    "we are particularly interested in study fluctuations around the uniform saddle - point solution .",
    "one can show that the asymptotic behavior of the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function of the linear sigma model in the leading order in @xmath0 expansion in a two - dimensional euclidean space fits the asymptotic distribution of the riemann zeros . in the next section we will present explicit calculations that prove our statement .",
    "the sigma model was first introduced in ref .   as an example realizing chiral symmetry and partial conservation of the axial current .",
    "the model is constructed with a fermionic isodoublet field , a triplet of pseudoscalar fields and also a scalar field .",
    "the sigma model without a fermionic isodoublet field with only two scalar fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 has widely discussed in the literature , as an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",

    "is given by the non - linear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "the non - linear sigma model is defined by the lagrangian density = _ ^t_with the constraint @xmath71 .",
    "the generating functional of the schwinger functions can be written as z=(d^4x + ) .",
    "the quantization of non - linear sigma models was initiated in refs .  .",
