    "as an important fundamental particle , weyl fermion has been studied in hight - energy physics for a long time , but not been found in nature yet@xcite . nevertheless , in condensed matter physics , weyl fermion can emerge as a quasiparticle in the so called weyl semimetal ( wsm)@xcite . this phenomenon is analogue to dirac points in graphene with band crossing and linear dispersion .",
    "recently , the weyl semimetal , with its novel properties , triggered enormous research activities@xcite , especially the milestone experimental discovery of the weyl fermions@xcite .",
    "contrasting with the dirac points in 2d graphene , weyl fermions in the 3d semimetal are topologically stable , because the hamiltonian uses up all three pauli matrixes so that any perturbation can just move the weyl points until meeting and annihilating with others with opposite topological numbers@xcite .",
    "topological property of wsm protects its surface gapless states which appear in the form of fermi arc@xcite .",
    "the fermi arc connects the projections in the surface brillouin zone of opposite weyl points .",
    "wsm also exhibits many other interesting phenomena , such as chiral anomaly@xcite , anomalous hall effect@xcite , negative magnetoresistance under parallel electric and magnetic fields and others@xcite .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "a massless four - component dirac fermion can be reduced to two two - component weyl fermions , which enables one to define a new good quantum number respectively according to their chirality@xcite . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "weyl fermions can be created in a similar way@xcite .",
    "one should find a matter with four - component massless dirac point band structure , which means that the energy bands should touch with each other at the dirac point with quadruple degeneracy and disperse linearly .",
    "the degeneracy of the weyl points is protected by time - reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry .",
    "breaking any of them will split them and create two weyl points . in this sense ,",
    "the weyl point has a four - component dirac parent .    here",
    ", however , we will create weyl fermions with a two - component semi - dirac parent in a 3d lattice , a stacked graphene system irradiated by a circularly polarized light .",
    "such a system can be solved using floquet theory . when the frequency of light is much large compared to the hopping parameters of lattice , floquet sub - bands are far from each other . with decreasing the frequency",
    ", sub - bands can get closer and closer to touch and overlap , and then separate and so forth@xcite .",
    "our investigation shows that with the frequency decreasing , each time when the @xmath0 floquet sub - bands touch , a semi - dirac point will be created and then split into two weyl points with opposite chirality , producing two weyl fermions .",
    "a frequency - amplitude phase diagram is completed .",
    "it is interesting that there can be one or two pairs of such weyl fermions in the regime of low light amplitude .",
    "it is also shown that a fermi arc can be created when a good surface is made .",
    "more detailed results will be presented in the following .",
    "we define @xmath1 to point to the @xmath2 direction and @xmath3 the @xmath4 direction , with the @xmath5 direction being perpendicular to the paper plane .",
    "the three - dimensional lattice model consists of infinite graphene layers , each of which can be considered to be translated from its nearest graphene layer by the vector @xmath6 in the @xmath7 plane@xcite , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . we consider only the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping constants within each layer and between the nearest layers .",
    "the light travels in @xmath4 direction , with its vector potential being in the @xmath7 plane : @xmath8 by the perierls substitution , @xmath9 , we can obtain the time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the complex conjugate of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath14 is used to denote the nn hopping parameter within the graphene layer and @xmath15 the hopping parameter between the nearest graphene layers .",
    "the intra - layer nn distance is denoted as @xmath16 and the inter - layer distance in equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "we define both @xmath15 and @xmath14 to be positive without losing any generality .    without applying the light ,",
    "we can obtain the 2d standard graphene if letting @xmath18 , and a nonzero @xmath15 destroys the @xmath19 symmetry but reserves inversion symmetry .",
    "therefore , the band structure is gapless when @xmath15 is less than @xmath14 .",
    "the gapless @xmath20 points are nothing but special dirac points defined with only two pauli matrixes , pretty like dirac points in the 2d graphene .",
    "they can survive even when the light turns on .    .",
    "the sliding displacement between the nearest graphene layers , with the length of @xmath21 , is along the @xmath2 axis , which becomes clear by using the top view ( b ) .",

    ", the eigenstates can be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for the quasi - energy of the floquet state , @xmath26 is the band index , and @xmath27 is periodic in @xmath28 . substituting @xmath29 into the schdinger equation leads to @xmath30 we can define the floquet hamiltonian as @xmath31    defining @xmath32 to be the fourier series of the periodic floquet state @xmath27 , and applying @xmath33 on the basis @xmath34 , we can express the operator @xmath33 explicitly in the composed hilbert space @xmath35@xcite , with inner product @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is spanned by the @xmath38-periodic function . with the annihilation and creating operator @xmath39 and @xmath40 fourier expanded in @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath33 can be expressed as a block matrix form with its block elements@xcite @xmath43 obviously , @xmath44 are the fourier modes of time periodic @xmath45 . without much effort , one can write the floquet hamiltonian as the block matrix form : @xmath46 the @xmath47 matrix block @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 defining @xmath50 , we can write the matrix elements in eq . ( 7 ) as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the bessel function of order @xmath53 .     +   +",
    "generally speaking , there are infinite floquet energy sub - bands labeled with @xmath54 . to begin with , we consider the high - frequency limit , where the frequency is much larger than the hopping parameters ( @xmath55 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the overlapping between different floquet sub - bands is negligible . as a result ,",
    "the floquet bands near the fermi energy are determined by @xmath56 , and the bands are gapless at points @xmath57 if the condition @xmath58 is satisfied .",
    "these points , appearing in pair , are similar to usual dirac points in the case of graphene , and are presented as the crossing points circled with green color in fig .",
    "their low - energy effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath59 we use usual definition for the pauli matrices : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "these mean that in this frequency regime the system is a dirac semimetal .",
    "when the light strength increases , the two gapless points will move towards the origin of the momentum space and will finally disappear at the origin , opening a semiconductor gap and causing the dirac semimetal to become an ordinary insulator .    when the frequency decreases further , there will be some overlapping between different floquet sub - bands . with the frequency decreasing , at first",
    ", the lower one of the @xmath63 sub - bands will intersect with the upper one of the @xmath64 sub - bands at @xmath65 and meanwhile the upper one of the @xmath66 bands will intersect with the lower one of the @xmath64 bands at @xmath67 . as a rule ,",
    "the near sub - bands whose @xmath68 values differ by @xmath69 will intersect .",
    "it should be pointed out that the perturbation introduced by @xmath70 , that stands for the coupling of one - photon stressed sub - bands and zero sub - bands by absorbing and emitting one photon , can open energy gaps at the band crossing points . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the band touching between the @xmath71 sub - bands at @xmath72 .",

    "the weyl points created by the band crossing of the @xmath71 sub - bands , with their weyl numbers labeled , are shown in fig .",
    "when the frequency decreases , the distance between the two weyl points in a pair become more separated and @xmath87 can approach @xmath100 but can not exceed it .",
    "thus , in this frequency regime , the system will stay in a wsm phase , with one pair of weyl points or two if one or both of the semi - dirac points ( responding to @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) were created . on the other hand , for the very strong light amplitude",
    ", we should have an ordinary insulator phase in the regime of high frequency . in this strong light regime",
    ", there can be a pair of weyl points astride @xmath83 when the frequency becomes enough low .",
    "the complete phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "we have six phases : semi - metal ( sm ) , weyl semi - metal with one pair of weyl fermions astride @xmath82 ( wsm1-a ) , weyl semi - metal with one pair of weyl fermions astride @xmath83 ( wsm1-b ) , weyl semi - metal with two pair of the weyl fermions ( wsm2 ) , ordinary insulator ( i ) , and weyl semi - metal ( wsm ) .",

    "the six triangles show the ( @xmath102,@xmath103 ) values for the band structures shown in fig .",
    "2.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +      one of the most striking phenomena in a wsm phase is its fermi arc .",
    "we can address it in a simple way . in our case",
    ", @xmath104 with a given @xmath79 can be considered as a 2d ( @xmath105,@xmath106 ) hamiltonian and one can calculate its @xmath79-dependent chern number @xmath107 . it is well known that for a 2d hamiltonian one can change its chern number by changing its parameters . in our case , the chern number will change by @xmath108 when @xmath79 crosses a weyl point where the mass term changes sign . it is easy to get @xmath109 when @xmath79 is between the two weyl points in each pair , and @xmath110 otherwise .",
    "semi - dirac points do not change the chern number because the @xmath111 near it has no mass term .",
    "we already illustrate the chern numbers in fig .",
    "2 . each nontrivial 2d hamiltonian have edge states located at its boundary and these edge states make the fermi arc which connects the projections of each pair of weyl points in the surface bz .",
    "therefore , as long as the surface is parallel to the @xmath79 axis , a fermi arc will emerge in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "it is clear that to experimentally realize the floquet weyl fermions , some appropriate multilayer structures are better than the infinitely - stacked graphene model .",
    "on the basis of the above surface construction , we can construct finite stacked graphene models under circularly - polarized light .",
    "such circularly - polarised - light - irradiated finitely - stacked models can be realized experimentally .",
    "they can host floquet weyl fermions and fermi arcs .",
    "for experimentally realizing floquet weyl fermions in such graphene - based models , one has to prepare the circularly - polarized light of suitable frequency and amplitude .",
    "because the nn hopping constants ( @xmath1122.8ev , @xmath113 ) are very large , we usually need a high frequency ( order of magnitude of @xmath114hz ) and a strong amplitude ( order of magnitude of @xmath115v / m ) .",
    "as shown in the phase diagram , however , the floquet weyl fermions can also be realized when the frequency is low or the amplitude is weak .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the regime of low frequency , other floquet sub - bands , such as those with @xmath116 , will play roles in creating floquet weyl points at @xmath117 , and therefore some complex situations may appear . fortunately , in the regime of weak field amplitude , one can realize one or two pairs of floquet weyl fermions at experimentally achievable frequency levels .",
    "in addition , some self - assembled graphene - like lattices of cdse nanostructures @xcite can be used to realize such floquet weyl fermions . because their hopping parameters are approximately two order of magnitude smaller compared to graphene and their lattice constant",
    "is one order of magnitude larger , much lower frequency and weaker amplitude are needed to realize floquet weyl fermions in good multilayer structures of such cdse nanostructures@xcite .    in conclusion , we have proposed an interesting method to create floquet weyl fermions with a two - component semi - dirac parent in a circularly - polarised - light - irradiated 3d stacked graphene system instead of a four - component dirac parent .",
    "one or two semi - dirac points can appear at @xmath118 or / and @xmath119 in momentum space when the frequency @xmath77 of light is on the order of magnitude of hopping parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . upon decreasing the light frequency , each semi - dirac point will split into two symmetrical weyl points with opposite chirality . further decreasing the frequency will make the weyl points move in the momentum space , and the weyl points can approach to the dirac points when the frequency becomes very small .",
    "the frequency - amplitude phase diagram has been worked out , indicating that the floquet weyl femions always appear in pair .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that there exist fermi arcs in the surface brillouin zones in circularly - polarised - light - irradiated semi - infinitely - stacked and finitely - multilayered graphene systems .",
    "these theoretical results can lead to a new platform to create weyl fermions in graphene - based and similar systems .",
