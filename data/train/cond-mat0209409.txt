    "the discovery of the first inorganic spin - peierls system cugeo@xmath1@xcite has lead to a strong revival of interest for one - dimensional spin systems .",
    "the thorough investigation of this compound performed in the last years has revealed new unexpected phenomena , like e.g. the coexistence of an antiferromagnetic state with the spin - peierls state in slightly doped cugeo@xmath1@xcite , as well as the importance of frustration , i.e. antiferromagnetic exchange between second nearest neighbours@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , despite intensive research , no second inorganic spin - peierls system , or example for a frustrated spin - chain could be yet established .",
    "a further new topic which has emerged in this field in the past years is the effect of a _ dzialoshinskii - moriya_@xcite@xmath10@xcite ( dm ) interaction and of a staggered g - factor anisotropy in such a spin - chain system .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies indicate that they lead to a pronounced increase of the susceptibility at low temperatures and to the opening of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectra upon applying a magnetic field@xcite@xmath10@xcite@xmath10@xcite . however , there are presently only very few systems where this effect could be investigated .",
    "most of the recent studies on one dimensional systems have been carried out on compounds based on cu@xmath11 , where the magnetism originates from the @xmath3 , one _ d_-hole cu@xmath11-state .",
    "thorough investigations of one - dimensional systems based on the electron counterparts , i.e. v@xmath12 or ti@xmath13 , are scarce . for most of them only preliminary susceptibility measurements , if at all , have been reported .",
    "this is surprising , since vanadium - based ternary and quaternary oxides form a large number of compounds , many of them crystallizing in low dimensional structures@xcite@xmath10@xcite .",
    "complex vanadium oxides have a very rich structural chemistry@xcite , since vanadium can be coordinated in pyramidal , tetrahedral , or octahedral form ( depending on the oxidation state ) , and these polyhedra can be joined in a large variety of ways@xcite@xmath10@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to get interesting arrangements of magnetic cations , resulting in anomalous magnetic properties .",
    "thus e.g. , unusual magnetic behaviours were observed in the past years in a series of compounds@xcite@xmath10@xcite ( cav@xmath0o@xmath14@xcite@xmath10@xcite , ca(sr)v@xmath1o@xmath15@xcite@xmath10@xcite@xmath10@xcite , ca(sr)v@xmath9o@xmath2@xcite@xmath10@xcite@xmath10@xcite , pb@xmath0v@xmath14o@xmath16@xcite ) where v@xmath12 in pyramidal coordination forms plaquettes connected in one or two dimensions .",
    "the possibility to tune the vanadium valence between + 4 ( one _ d _ electron ) and + 3 ( two _ d _ electrons ) allows the realization of both @xmath3 and @xmath17 spin systems , where one expect the strongest quantum effects .",
    "compounds with an intermediate valence - state , as for example @xmath18-nav@xmath0o@xmath14@xcite@xmath10@xcite , allow to study the interplay between magnetic and charge degrees of freedom . for both v@xmath12 and v@xmath13 states , depending on",
    "the local configuration of the v - atoms , degenerated or nearly degenerated @xmath19 levels can be achieved leading to additional orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "combining these degrees of freedom might lead to new interesting phenomena .",
    "thus v - compounds were e.g. suggested to be the ideal candidates for systems with strong biquadratic interactions@xcite@xmath10@xcite@xmath10@xcite .",
    "we have therefore started a more detailed study of low dimensional ternary and quaternary vanadium oxides .",
    "we present here our investigation of the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of sr@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( svo ) and ba@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bvo ) and discuss our experimental results using several basic models and band structure calculations .",
    "whereas in most of the low - dimensional vanadates investigated so far v@xmath12 has a square pyramidal coordination , in these two compounds v@xmath12 is located in an octahedral environment . as our results show , this has a profound influence on the magnetic properties .",

    "two of them show a tetrahedral oxygen - environment and can therefore be assigned to v@xmath20 , whereas one site shows an octahedral environment and can therefore be assigned to v@xmath12 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the situation e.g. in nav@xmath21o@xmath22 , there is a clear and complete v@xmath12 - v@xmath20 charge ordering .",

    "in contrast , correlation in the direction of the vanadyl bond between different chains might be absent because the difference in the total - energy between parallel and antiparallel arrangement should be extremely weak .",

    "therefore , we have to discuss possible intrinsic origins . the first trivial idea , that this upturn is due to a weak ferromagnetic inter - chain interaction seems to be incorrect .",
    "the inclusion of a weak ferromagnetic inter - chain coupling within a mean field approach lead to a t - independent downwards shift of the @xmath61 vs @xmath62 curve , i.e to a larger increase of @xmath8(t ) at @xmath63 than below @xmath63 , in contradiction to the experimental results . as stated above , the staggered field effect caused by the dm - interaction and the staggered g - factor anisotropy ( @xmath64 ) was recently demonstrated to be responsible for such upturn in some one - dimensional cu@xmath11 compounds@xcite@xmath10@xcite and in @xmath65@xcite .",
    "since our results are similar to the behaviour found in these systems , the staggered field effect appears to be a promising alternative explanation for our observations . according to moriya@xcite",
    ", a dm - interaction is expected if the mid - point between two interacting magnetic ions is not an inversion centre . due to the low symmetry of our compounds",

    "at the same time , the splitting of the @xmath19 orbital levels due to the off - center displacement of the v - ions ( @xmath71   ) was estimated by us to give @xmath72 to @xmath73 . in comparison , for cu@xmath11",

    "preliminary esr measurements performed in svo@xcite indicate a rather small g - factor anisotropy with @xmath76 .",

    "contrary , the low temperature curie constants _ c _ measured in bvo and , specially in svo are even larger than the averaged one inferred from the data reported for the _ cu _ compounds .",
    "we remind , however , that in cu - benzoate@xcite the anomalous low temperature term @xmath78 in @xmath8(t ) is also several times larger than that predicted in the theory@xcite .    with the dm - interaction as origin of the @xmath8(t ) upturn ,",
    "the difference between the annealing effects in svo and bvo can be understood . as stated above",

    "the tetrahedrally coordinated v(1 ) and v(2 ) have only a very small contribution at the fermi level . disregarding the spread overlap charge with the o 2@xmath85 valence states ,",
    "this leads to a picture of v@xmath20 ions .",
    "on the other hand , the octahedral v(3 ) site shows a half filled orbital at the fermi level , leading to a magnetically active spin 1/2 v@xmath12 ion .",
    "thus , the calculation is fully consistent with the empirical assignment of the different v species mentioned earlier .    analyzing the slater - koster - integrals for the different v(3)-o terms we find a much larger overlap for the short v(3)-o vanadyl bond compared with the longer v(3)-o bond to the opposite corner of the octahedron .",

    "this is very much in line with the present scenario ( @xmath124 = 1/2 ( @xmath122 + @xmath123 ) = 5 k and @xmath125 = 1.9 k ) and a strong indication that the magnetic coupling in such anisotropic systems deserves further theoretical investigation .",

    "this is a possible indication for an enhanced dm interaction ( being proportional to 1/@xmath68 ) .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the split @xmath68 from our calculation would be problematic due to the known failure of lda resulting in a metallic solution with the half filled states at the fermi level instead of an insulating behavior as observed in the experiment .",
    "the calculation of @xmath68 , using a more appropriate method , e.g. lda+@xmath129 , is a future task .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic and the thermodynamic properties of two ternary vanadium oxide compounds , svo and bvo , where the magnetic v@xmath12 ions are located off - centered in vo@xmath23 octahedra , forming chains .",
    "analysis of the results show that both compounds are quasi one - dimensional spin systems , with",
    "_ intra - chain _",
    "exchanges @xmath130 and @xmath5 for svo and bvo , respectively . in svo ,",
    "antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath6 indicate a weak _ inter - chain _ exchange @xmath131 .",
    "in contrast , no evidence for magnetic order could be observed in bvo , pointing to a very small @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the conjecture , based on simple standard arguments , that in svo the magnetic chain is perpendicular to the structural vo@xmath23-octahedra chain is confirmed by an analysis of elaborated lda calculations .",
    "both compounds present an unusual upturn of the susceptibility at low temperatures , which we suggest to be due to a sizeable dm - interaction . in svo",
    "the size of this low temperature upturn as well as the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature increase when the samples are annealed .",
    "this peculiar low temperature behaviour shall be the subject of future detailed investigations carried out on single crystals .",
