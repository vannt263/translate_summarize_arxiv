    "in hadronic collisions at high energy the partons inside the colliding hadrons form a very dense system which is known as the colour glass condensate .",
    "the colour glass condensate is expected to have very interesting properties which can be studied experimentally in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering as well as in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "one aspect of particular interest is the question whether the parton densities inside the colliding hadrons saturate at sufficiently high energies .",
    "if saturation indeed takes place it can in turn tame the growth of hadronic cross sections with the centre - of - mass energy @xmath2 .",
    "it is a very challenging theoretical problem to determine the relevant scales in the energy and in the momentum transfer at which saturation effects set in and to predict the resulting behaviour of the cross sections .",
    "a variety of different approaches has been developed in order to find answers to these questions .",
    "the approach which has been most popular recently and from which the name colour glass condensate originates is the one initiated by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite which was further developed for example in @xcite , for a review and further references see @xcite . a related approach based on the operator expansion method applied to wilson line operators was used in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the relation between these two approaches was established in @xcite .",
    "the latter approach leads to a hierarchy of equations which can be drastically simplified in the large-@xmath3 limit . in this limit one",
    "obtains the so - called balitsky - kovchegov equation which has also been obtained in @xcite using the colour dipole approach to high energy scattering @xcite-@xcite . in the colour dipole approach one studies the evolution of a small colour dipole due to gluon emissions . in the large-@xmath3",
    "limit the emission of a gluon can be interpreted as a splitting of the dipole into two dipoles , and the interaction of two such systems after evolution is described by the basic dipole - dipole scattering via gluon exchange .",
    "another approach to the physics of the colour glass condensate is the classic one based on the perturbative resummation of large logarithms of the centre - of - mass energy @xmath2 in high energy collisions .",
    "this resummation program was performed in @xcite , resulting in the celebrated balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation which resums all terms of the form @xmath4 in the perturbative series .",
    "this approximation scheme is called the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) . on the level of the cross section ,",
    "i.e.   the squared amplitude , the bfkl equation describes the exchange of two interacting reggeised gluons in the @xmath5-channel , called the bfkl pomeron .",
    "it is known that at higher energies exchanges of more than two gluons in the @xmath5-channel eventually become important , and one has to include them in order to find an appropriate description of the high energy limit .",
    "this is done in the generalized leading logarithmic approximation ( glla ) .",
    "there are two forms of this approximation .",
    "the first one considers only exchanges in which the number of reggeised gluons remains constant during the @xmath5-channel evolution .",
    "the corresponding resummation of the leading logarithmic terms for a given number of gluons is encoded in the bartels - kwieciski - praszaowicz ( bkp ) equations @xcite .",
    "that form of the glla can be considered as the quantum mechanics of states of @xmath6 gluons exchanged in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "one expects to obtain a scattering amplitude satisfying the unitarity bound for the total cross section when all contributions with arbitrary @xmath6 are included - gluon amplitudes of both versions of the glla are often called unitarity corrections . ] . in order to obtain amplitudes satisfying unitarity also in all subchannels one has to include also contributions in which the number of reggeised gluons is permitted to vary during the @xmath5-channel evolution , giving rise to the second version of the glla which we call extended glla ( eglla ) @xcite .",
    "that step turns the quantum mechanical problem of states with a fixed number of gluons into a quantum field theory of reggeised gluons in which states with different numbers of gluons are coupled to each other .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are described by a tower of coupled integral equations generalizing the bkp equations .",
    "these equations constitute the basis of the eglla .",
    "their structure has been investigated in a series of papers , see for example @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a remarkable result found in these studies is the conformal invariance of the amplitudes of the eglla in two - dimensional impact parameter space .",
    "there are in fact strong indications that the whole set of amplitudes can be formulated as a conformal field theory .",
    "the approaches mentioned above are to a large extent based on the application of perturbative concepts .",
    "the use of perturbation theory is justified in high energy scattering processes which are dominated by a single large momentum scale .",
    "it would clearly be a great success if one could obtain a good description of the high energy limit of qcd in a perturbative framework .",
    "the practical applicability of such a perturbative picture would remain restricted to certain scattering processes dominated by a large momentum scale .",
    "nevertheless , it would be very valuable to see how for example the structure of regge theory can emerge from perturbative qcd .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the wealth of hadronic scattering processes at high energies is dominated by low momenta .",
    "a satisfactory description of high energy scattering therefore eventually requires to include nonperturbative effects .",
    "the hope is that one can explore the transition region to low momenta starting from the perturbative framework .",
    "a recent example for the use of this method is @xcite where it was found that the validity of the froissart bound on the high energy behaviour of total cross sections , @xmath7 , appears to be closely related to confinement effects . in the long - term perspective",
    "one would hope that it is also possible to find relations between the perturbative approaches and generically nonperturbative approaches to high energy scattering like for example the implementation @xcite-@xcite of the stochastic vacuum model of @xcite in the nonperturbative framework of @xcite , or even regge theory ( see for example @xcite ) , although this is extremely challenging .",
    "the different perturbatively motivated approaches have their respective advantages .",
    "the approach of @xcite-@xcite is for example particularly well suited for estimating the momentum scales at which saturation effects set in whereas in the eglla the conformal invariance of the amplitudes and the phenomenon of reggeisation become particularly transparent .",
    "it would obviously be very desirable to understand the exact relations between these different approaches to the problem of high energy scattering .",
    "interestingly , the bfkl equation is reproduced by all approaches mentioned above in a suitable limit corresponding to sufficiently low parton densities . in particular",
    ", that limit corresponds to a situation in which nonlinear effects in the evolution of the system can be neglected .",
    "another important quantity which plays an important role in all approaches to the colour glass condensate is the perturbative one - to - two pomeron vertex which was first derived in the eglla @xcite .",
    "its value for the leading pomeron states was computed in @xcite and was found to agree with the value found in the dipole model of high energy scattering @xcite .",
    "the very same vertex occurs also in the other approaches and is a crucial ingredient for example in the balitsky - kovchegov equation . in order to find characteristic differences between the different approaches one should therefore go beyond the approximation in which only pomerons and their simplest vertex occurs .",
    "one possibility is to look at the exchange of negative charge parity quantum numbers associated with the odderon , for a review see @xcite .",
    "the odderon has only been identified and studied in the two versions of the glla , and most recently also in the dipole picture @xcite .",
    "the other promising possibility is to study vertices with more than three pomerons and here in particular the one - to - three pomeron vertex .",
    "this vertex has so far only been considered in the dipole model and in the approach due to balitsky , and there are apparently contradicting findings about its existence in the literature . based on a generalization of the one - to - two pomeron vertex in the dipole model an explicit form of the one - to - three pomeron vertex is conjectured in @xcite ,",
    "whereas in @xcite it is argued that such a vertex is absent in the dipole picture at least in the leading approximation . in the approach due to balitsky , on the other hand ,",
    "a one - to - three pomeron transition was identified in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we derive the one - to - three pomeron vertex in the colour glass condensate using the framework of the eglla and hence establish the existence of such a vertex in this approach .",
    "we obtain the one - to - three pomeron vertex by projecting the two - to - six reggeised gluon vertex calculated in @xcite onto pomeron eigenfunctions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : eglla ] we recall some important properties of the eglla and describe in particular the effective two - to - six reggeon vertex .",
    "we also discuss the main results for the one - to - two pomeron vertex and the available results and and conjectures concerning vertices with more pomerons .",
    "we describe how the effective reggeon vertices of the eglla can be used to calculate multi - pomeron vertices , in particular how the one - to - three pomeron vertex is obtained from the two - to - six reggeon vertex . in section [ sec : wp3p ] we perform the explicit calculation of the one - to - three pomeron vertex . collecting the different contributions obtained in that section we give our final result for the one - to - three pomeron vertex and discuss its implications in section [ sumandconcl ] .",
    "some useful formulae needed for the calculation are derived in the appendix .",
    "in the eglla one considers exchanges in the @xmath5-channel in which the number of reggeised gluons can fluctuate during the @xmath5-channel evolution .",
    "the objects of interest in the eglla are amplitudes describing the production of @xmath6 reggeised gluons in the @xmath5-channel . for",
    "any given @xmath6 one then resums all diagrams of the perturbative series which contain the maximal number of logarithms of the energy for that @xmath6 .",
    "so far the eglla has been studied explicitly only for the case that the system of reggeised gluons is coupled to a virtual photon impact factor .",
    "it is expected that due to high energy factorization the results obtained in that special case are universal . in particular ,",
    "the interaction vertices between states with different numbers of reggeised gluons have a universal meaning independent of the impact factor .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath8 describe the production of @xmath6 reggeised gluons in the @xmath5-channel carrying transverse momenta @xmath9 and colour labels @xmath10 .",
    "the lowest order term of these amplitudes is given by the virtual photon impact factor consisting of a quark loop to which the @xmath6 gluons are coupled .",
    "but there are also terms in which less than @xmath6 gluons are coupled to the quark loop and there are transitions to more gluons during the @xmath5-channel evolution .",
    "technically this means that the amplitudes @xmath11 obey a tower of coupled integral equations in which the equation for a given @xmath6 involves all amplitudes @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the first of these integral equations ( i.e.  the one for @xmath14 ) is identical to the bfkl equation . in the higher equations",
    "new transition kernels occur which are generalizations of the bfkl kernel .",
    "they have been derived in @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the system of the integral equations have been studied in @xcite-@xcite , for a detailed description and a systematic approach to solving the equations see @xcite .",
    "the structure of the solutions is such that they involve only states with fixed even numbers of gluons which are coupled to each other by effective transition vertices that can be computed explicitly .",
    "the reggeisation of the gluon is responsible for the fact that in the solutions of the integral equations for the amplitudes @xmath11 the states with fixed odd numbers of gluons do not occur .",
    "the simplest example for reggeisation in the amplitudes is the three - gluon amplitude which can be shown to be a superposition of two - gluon amplitudes of the form [ d3reggeizes ] d^abc_3 ( _ 1,_2,_3 ) = g f_abc . as a consequence , an actual three ",
    "gluon state in the @xmath5-channel does not occur . in each of the three terms in this expression",
    "the momenta of two gluons enter only as a sum .",
    "they can be regarded as forming a ` more composite ' reggeised gluon that occurs in the amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "reggeisation occurs also in all higher amplitudes @xmath11 , all of which contain a contribution which can be decomposed into two - gluon amplitudes in a way similar to ( [ d3reggeizes ] ) . in the higher amplitudes also more than two gluons can form a more composite reggeised gluon .",
    "the details of this process are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the three - gluon amplitude can be written completely in terms of two - gluon amplitudes . in the higher amplitudes with @xmath15 gluons",
    "additional contributions occur .",
    "the structure of the four - gluon amplitude can be written in symbolic form as @xcite : @xmath16 here the first term is again the reggeising part consisting of a superposition of two - gluon amplitudes in a way similar to ( [ d3reggeizes ] ) . in the second term",
    "the @xmath5-channel evolution starts with a two  gluon state that is coupled to a full four - gluon state via a new effective 2-to-4 gluon transition vertex @xmath17 the explicit form of which was found in @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ d4solutionpics ] ) the four - gluon state does not couple directly to the quark box diagram of the photon impact factor .",
    "the structure emerging here is that of a quantum field theory in which states with different numbers of gluons are coupled to each other via effective transition vertices like @xmath17 . this structure has been shown to persist also to higher amplitudes in @xcite .",
    "there the amplitudes with up to six gluons were studied .",
    "it turns out that the five - gluon amplitude can be written completely in terms of two - gluon amplitudes and four - gluon amplitudes containing the vertex @xmath17 .",
    "the mechanism of reggeisation is universal and it is expected that all amplitudes @xmath11 with an odd number @xmath6 of gluons are superpositions of lower amplitudes with even numbers of gluons .",
    "the six - gluon amplitude @xmath18 was shown to consist of three parts .",
    "first there are two reggeising parts , one of them ( called @xmath19 in @xcite ) is a superposition of two - gluon amplitudes . in this term",
    "the six gluons arrange themselves in all possible ways in two groups which can then be regarded as composite gluon states forming the two reggeised gluons of the two - gluon amplitude .",
    "the second part of the six - gluon amplitude ( called @xmath20 in @xcite ) is a superposition of four - gluon states . in these",
    "the six gluons arrange themselves in four groups , and the resulting amplitude is identical to a superposition of four - gluon amplitudes .",
    "the four gluons couple to the photons in a way similar to the last term in ( [ d4solutionpics ] ) , namely via a two - gluon state .",
    "the coupling of the two - gluon to the four - gluon state happens via the transition vertices @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xcite which can in turn be related to the two - to - four gluon vertex @xmath23 in ( [ d4solutionpics ] ) .",
    "these are the two reggeising parts of the six - gluon amplitude .",
    "finally , there is a part in which a two  gluon state is coupled to a six - gluon state via a new effective transition vertex @xmath24 which has been computed explicitly in @xcite .",
    "this vertex will be the starting point for our calculation of the one - to - three pomeron vertex .",
    "we will therefore describe it in more detail in the next section .",
    "closing this section we point out that the effective transition vertices have the remarkable property of being conformally invariant in two - dimensional impact parameter space @xcite .",
    "let us now review the properties of the two - to - six reggeised gluon vertex occurring in the effective field theory structure found for the @xmath6-gluon amplitudes @xmath11 .",
    "here we concentrate on the properties which are essential for the calculation of the one - to - three pomeron vertex , for the derivation and further properties of the two - to - six gluon vertex we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the two - to - six vertex couples a two - gluon state to a six - gluon state .",
    "the two - gluon state is given by a bfkl pomeron amplitude .",
    "in @xcite only the case was considered in which that pomeron amplitude is coupled to a quark loop .",
    "the corresponding pomeron amplitude is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "further below we will instead use a pomeron amplitude @xmath26 without the quark loop and then assume it to be an eigenfunction of the bfkl kernel .",
    "the two - to - six vertex is defined as an integral operator acting on the two - gluon state @xmath14 .",
    "it carries six colour labels for the outgoing gluons , and the incoming gluons are in a colour singlet state .",
    "further the vertex is a function of the transverse momenta of the incoming and outgoing gluons .",
    "when the vertex acts on the two - gluon state @xmath14 one integrates over the transverse momenta of the two incoming gluons .",
    "we will use a shorthand notation in which the six momentum arguments are replaced by the indices of the respective gluons , ( v_26^a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6d_2 ) ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4,_5,_6)= ( v_26^a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6d_2)(1,2,3,4,5,6 ) , i.e.  1 stands for @xmath27 , 2 for @xmath28 and so on .",
    "a string of several indices , for instance 123 , means the sum of the momenta , @xmath29 .",
    "an empty argument , which will be denoted by `` @xmath30 '' , stands for zero momentum .",
    "this notation has the advantage that it can be easily transformed into a configuration - space expression . in configuration space",
    ", an index stands for the corresponding coordinate .",
    "a string of indices means that the coordinates are identified via two - dimensional delta functions by which the expression has to be multiplied .",
    "an empty argument `` @xmath30 '' translates into an integral over the corresponding coordinate argument in position space .",
    "the dependence of the vertex on the colour labels of the six outgoing gluons is given by 2 ( v_26^a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6d_2)(1,2,3,4,5,6)= & & d_a_1a_2a_3d_a_4a_5a_6(wd_2)(1,2,3;4,5,6 ) & + & d_a_1a_2a_4d_a_3a_5a_6(wd_2)(1,2,4;3,5,6)+  .",
    "& eq : v2to6it contains only colour tensors which are products of two symmetric structure constants @xmath31 of @xmath32 .",
    "the sum runs over all ten partitions of the six momenta and the corresponding colour indices into two groups of three .",
    "the function @xmath33 is a convolution of a function @xmath34 and a pomeron amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "as we have already pointed out the vertex occurs only in situations in which it acts on a bfkl pomeron state , and we will therefore consider only the combination @xmath33 rather than the integral operator @xmath34 alone .",
    "note that the function @xmath33 is the same in all terms in ( [ eq : v2to6 ] ) , only the momentum arguments are permutated in the different terms . as shown in @xcite the function @xmath33",
    "can be expressed in terms of a function @xmath35 , 2 ( wd_2)(1,2,3;4,5,6)&= & 8 _ mp(\\{1,  ,6 } ) ( -1)^#mg(123\\m , m,456\\m ) . &",

    "@xmath38  is the number of indices contained in  @xmath36 .",
    "this sum and the symmetry of the function  @xmath35 under exchange of its first and third argument cause the function @xmath33 to be symmetric under all permutations of its first three and its last three arguments , and under exchange of these two groups of arguments .",
    "together with the sum in  ( [ eq : v2to6 ] ) , this makes the @xmath25 vertex symmetric under arbitrary permutations of the six outgoing gluons , i.e.  under simultaneous permutations of the colour labels and momenta of the gluons .",
    "the function @xmath35 had been introduced in @xcite and was further analysed in @xcite .",
    "it depends on three momentum arguments and has the following form : with component functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath5 which will be defined below .",
    "it can be easily seen already from  ( [ eq : g_symb ] ) that @xmath35 is symmetric under the exchange of its first and third argument . that symmetry does not apply to the second argument .",
    "however , there is a different interesting property related to that argument .",
    "when the second momentum argument is set to zero , the @xmath39 and @xmath42 functions vanish and @xmath35 essentially reduces to the well - known bfkl kernel applied to the amplitude @xmath14 , [ greducemomentum ] g(1,-,3)&= & _ 1 ^ 2 _ 3 ^ 2 ( k_d_2)(1,3 ) , + & = & [ 2 c(13 ) - 2 b(1,3 ) - 2 b(3,1 ) + t(1,3 ) + t(3,1 ) ] .",
    "this is becomes clear directly from the explicit form of the component functions to which we turn momentarily , and which also defines the convolution in this equation .",
    "note that we understand the bfkl kernel to contain a delta function identifying the sums of the two incoming and the two outgoing momenta .",
    "further , it can be proven that @xmath35 vanishes when its first or last momentum argument vanishes , this is because then the component functions either vanish or turn into a different component function with fewer arguments ( see below ) and cancel among each other .",
    "let us now take a closer look at the component functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and  @xmath5 , of which @xmath35 is composed .",
    "they were originally defined in momentum space @xcite via these functions are not infrared safe separately , but the infrared divergences cancel in the combination in which they occur in the function @xmath35 .",
    "there are some relations between the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and  @xmath41 and between @xmath42 and @xmath5 and the so - called trajectory function  @xmath43 , namely 2 b(k_1,k_2)&=&a(k_1,0,k_2)=a(k_1,k_2,0 ) & eq : abcstrel_m_bc(k)&=&b(k,0)=a(k,0,0 ) & eq : abcstrel_m_cs(k_1,k_2,k_3)&= & -2n_cg^2(k_1)d_2(k_1+k_2,k_3 ) & eq : abcstrel_m_st(k_1,k_2)&=&s(k_1,0,k_2)= -2n_cg^2(k_1)d_2(k_1,k_2 ) & eq : abcstrel_m_tthe trajectory function  @xmath43 is defined in momentum space as @xmath44 and the function @xmath45 is known as the regge trajectory of the gluon .",
    "it is convenient to perform the calculation of the one - to - three pomeron vertex in impact parameter space where one can make use of the properties of the function @xmath35 and of the component functions under conformal transformations .",
    "these properties have first been studied in @xcite where it was argued that @xmath35 is invariant under conformal transformations in impact parameter space , i.e.  under mbius transformations of the coordinate arguments of @xmath35 .",
    "this property was used in @xcite to prove the conformal invariance of the two - to - six gluon vertex @xmath24 . for a more rigorous discussion of the conformal invariance of @xmath35 and of the behaviour of the regularised component functions under conformal transformations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we therefore also need the impact parameter ( or position space ) representation of the component functions .",
    "the momentum space and positions space representations are related to each other via fourier transformation , for the function @xmath35 for example we have g(_1,_2,_3 ) = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 g(_1,_2,_3 ) . in two - dimensional impact parameter space",
    "we use complex coordinates , @xmath46 .",
    "we use the same symbol for the momentum space representation and the position space representation of a function , and again we often make use of the shorthand notation in which an index now stands for the corresponding coordinate .",
    "let us now give the expressions for the component functions in complex coordinates @xcite . for reasons to be explained in the next section we here use the notation @xmath47 .",
    "then we have where we have used the definition _",
    "ij = _ i - _ j .",
    "these functions are regularised with a gluon mass  @xmath48 , and the limit @xmath49 is implied in all expressions above .",

    "the function @xmath35 reduces to a double laplacian of the well - known bfkl kernel multiplied by a constant when the second momentum argument is set to zero , 2 g(1,-,3)&= & 1n_c_1_3 ( k_d_2)(1,3 ) . &",
    "eq : g_bfkl let us finally note that the representation  ( [ eq : wd2 ] ) for the two - to - six vertex is easily generalised to other ( even ) numbers of reggeised gluons . in fact the @xmath52 reggeised gluon vertex can be written as a sum over functions @xmath53 which are defined in terms of the function @xmath35 in analogy to  ( [ eq : wd2 ] )  @xcite . in that case",
    "the sum runs over all ( three ) partitions of four indices into two groups of two .",
    "it is conjectured that there exist higher @xmath54 reggeised gluon vertices which are also new elements of the effective field theory of unitarity corrections and which are of analogous form @xcite .",
    "we will now use the @xmath55 reggeised gluon vertices of the eglla in order to define @xmath56 pomeron vertices .",
    "we will give the definition explicitly only for @xmath57 , but assuming the existence of the higher @xmath55 reggeised gluon vertices it is straightforward to extend the definition to arbitrary @xmath6 .",

    "the vertices of the effective field theory for the @xmath6-gluon amplitudes in the eglla couple states with different numbers of reggeised gluons to each other .",

    "the two - gluon state is a bfkl pomeron state which is coupled to a virtual photon impact factor .",
    "the vertex is separated in rapidity from that quark loop by pomeron evolution .",

    "the pomerons are colour singlet states and the projection in colour space is performed via the contraction of the colour tensor of the vertex @xmath71 with delta - tensors for the pairs of gluons corresponding to the pomeron states .",
    "note that we have chosen the outgoing pomerons to be represented by complex conjugated eigenfunctions .",
    "we implicitly assume that @xmath14 is replaced by a pure bfkl amplitude according to ( [ replaced2phi2 ] ) . as indicated in the subscript of the square bracket we further replace the full amplitude @xmath26 by an eigenfunction @xmath74 of the bfkl kernel .",
    "the resulting quantity contains all relevant information of the coupling of the three pomerons with the parameters @xmath75 , and the corresponding amplitude with three full pomeron states is easily reconstructed .",
    "we will in the following always use the amplitude @xmath14 in the sense that it has to be replaced according to ( [ replaced2phi2 ] ) , in particular also inside the function @xmath35 .",
    "the projection ( [ eq : vp2pdef ] ) has been performed explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath76 pomeron vertex was found to be a conformal three - point function of the three pomeron coordinates , v_2= c_\\ { h_i,|h_i } ^-1 , where @xmath67 is the coordinate of the pomeron state with quantum numbers @xmath77 etc . , and the coefficient @xmath78 depends only on the conformal weights of the three pomeron states .",
    "this finding motivates the symbolic notation of the vertex as a three - point correlation function , v_2= e^(_a , n_a)^*(_a)e^(_b , n_b)^*(_b ) e^(_c , n_c)(_c ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath78 in the @xmath76 pomeron vertex is the sum of two terms , one of which is suppressed by two powers of @xmath3 with respect to the other .",
    "the numerical value of these two terms in the perturbative @xmath76 pomeron vertex was found in @xcite for the pomeron ` ground states ' with @xmath79 which are leading in the high energy limit .",
    "the value of the term leading in @xmath3 obtained in this way starting from the eglla coincides exactly with the value found in @xcite in the dipole picture of high energy scattering which is based on the large-@xmath3 limit . in @xcite the value of the perturbative @xmath76 pomeron vertex",
    "was later found to be of the same order of magnitude as nonperturbative estimates of the triple - pomeron vertex in regge - type fits to scattering data at high energies .",
    "the formula for the @xmath76 pomeron vertex obtained in the dipole picture in @xcite exhibits a relatively simple structure . motivated by this observation",
    "a generalisation of that formula to @xmath56 pomeron vertices with arbitrary @xmath6 was conjectured in @xcite motivated by results of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this generalised formula could be related to dual shapiro - virasoro amplitudes of a closed string theory . however , in @xcite it was shown that in the dipole picture a direct transition , i.e.  a transition local in rapidity , from one to more than two pomerons is not possible . instead ,",
    "in the framework of the dipole picture such a transition can only occur via the iteration of the @xmath76 pomeron vertex , resulting in the well - known fan diagrams .",
    "the latter result does not necessarily exclude the existence of such vertices in general .",
    "instead , it is well conceivable that it is the outcome of the large-@xmath3 limit used in the dipole picture .",
    "a natural next step beyond the limitations of the dipole model would be to include also higher multipoles .",
    "it is well conceivable that in such an extension of the dipole model ( including quadrupoles for instance ) a direct @xmath59 pomeron vertex would occur and possibly be of the form suggested in @xcite .",
    "the perturbative @xmath80 pomeron vertex is defined in analogy to the @xmath76 pomeron vertex above , now using the @xmath81 gluon vertex discussed in detail in the previous section .",
    "due to the complete symmetry of that vertex in the six outgoing gluons it again does not matter which gluons are chosen to form pomeron states .",
    "we choose the pairs @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath82 , and the coordinates of these three pomeron states will be @xmath67 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the pomeron state attached to the vertex from above will have the coordinate @xmath85 .",
    "we will often not write down the external coordinates as arguments , which coordinate is which will be clear from the conformal dimensions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and  @xmath89 .",
    "hence the projection of the @xmath81 gluon vertex defining the @xmath59 pomeron vertex can be written as 2 v_3&= & _ a_1a_2_a_3a_4_a_5a_6 _ _ 2//e^(_d , n_d ) & & e^(_a , n_a)^*(1,2)e^(_b , n_b)^ * ( 3,4)e^(_c , n_c)^ * ( 5,6 ) . & eq : vp3pdefnote again our convention in which the three outgoing pomerons are described by complex conjugated eigenfunctions .",
    "anticipating that the vertex will turn out to have the form of a conformal four - point function we will also use the symbolic notation of the vertex as a correlation function v_3= e^(_a , n_a)^*(_a)e^(_b , n_b)^*(_b ) e^(_c , n_c)^*(_c)e^(_d , n_d)(_d ) . in the present paper we will restrict ourselves to the leading pomeron states at high energies , i.e.  the states with @xmath90 , and this applies to all four pomeron states in the @xmath59 pomeron vertex .",
    "the pomeron vertices defined above are constructed from the number - changing vertices @xmath58 and @xmath24 of the eglla .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that also other terms in the @xmath6-gluon amplitudes @xmath11 can in general give rise to multi - pomeron vertices . in the case of the @xmath76 pomeron vertex for example also",
    "the reggeising part of the amplitude , i.e.  the first term in ( [ d4solutionpics ] ) , gives a nonvanishing contribution upon projection on pomeron states .",
    "so far this contribution has not yet been studied in much detail . in the case of the six - gluon amplitude @xmath18",
    "there are two such reggeising terms , one being a superposition of two - gluon amplitudes and the other being a superposition of irreducible four - gluon amplitudes , containing in particular the effective transition vertices @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xcite .",
    "we will not consider the contribution of these terms to the @xmath59 pomeron vertex in the present paper .",
    "these terms can well be important and clearly deserve further study .",
    "first steps in this direction have been performed in @xcite .",
    "the two gluons in a pomeron form a colour singlet state , and hence the corresponding colour structure is @xmath91 . because the symmetric structure constants @xmath31 vanish when two of their indices are contracted less than half of the terms in the sum in  ( [ eq : v2to6 ] ) contribute to the @xmath80 pomeron vertex .",
    "the only remaining terms are those in which the two colour indices of each pomeron are contracted with different @xmath92 tensors . since we chose as pomerons the pairs ( 12 ) , ( 34 ) and ( 56 ) of gluons , this leaves the following four permutations of ( colour , momentum or coordinate ) indices : 2 ( 1,3,5;2,4,6),(1,3,6;2,4,5),(1,4,5;2,3,6),(1,4,6;2,3,5 ) .&&&eq : projind    each of these permutations gives rise to the same colour factor because of the symmetry of @xmath31 .",
    "since each @xmath31 tensor is contracted with one index of each of the @xmath93s , the result is the contraction of two @xmath92 tensors . for general @xmath3",
    "we denote this contraction by @xmath94 .",
    "its value is , calculated for example for the first permutation , = d_a_1a_3a_5d_a_2a_4a_6_a_1a_2_a_3a_4_a_5a_6= d_a_1a_3a_5d_a_1a_3a_5=1n_c(n_c^2 - 4)(n_c^2 - 1 ) .",
    "the lion s share of the work to be done for the projection is sorting out all the terms of the spatial part of @xmath95 .",
    "this work is complicated by the fact that the simple representation of @xmath95 in terms of @xmath35 does not help in obtaining the @xmath80 pomeron vertex .",
    "that is because due to @xmath96 some of the component functions of @xmath35 vanish on projection , others do nt .",
    "the brute - force way of extracting those that remain would be to write out @xmath33 in terms of the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and  @xmath5 and sort out those that vanish upon projection . however , there is a more systematic way .",
    "first , we observe that the four permutations ( [ eq : projind ] ) remaining after the contraction of colour tensors all lead to the same term .",
    "this is because they differ only by swapping two coordinates of the same pomeron wave function , which is symmetric .",
    "hence it is sufficient to consider only one of the permutations and multiply the result by four .",
    "the second important observation is that the conformal eigenfunctions  @xmath97 vanish if their two coordinate arguments are equal , @xmath96",
    ". therefore terms in which both argument indices of the same pomeron occur in the same argument of  @xmath35 vanish under projection .",
    "this is the key to finding out which terms remain after projection .",
    "let us now have a look at the first permutation in  ( [ eq : projind ] ) .",
    "the spatial part of the vertex for this permutation has the following form : 2 ( wd_2)(1,3,5;2,4,6)&= & 8 _ mp(\\{1,  ,6})-20mu ( -1)^#mg(135\\m , m,246\\m ) . &",
    "eq : wd2_135we can see immediately that a term from this sum vanishes if two coordinates of the same pomeron are contained in the middle argument of  @xmath35 .",
    "the first and last argument of  @xmath35 contain only coordinates or momenta belonging to different pomerons and hence can not cause the term to vanish under projection",
    ". therefore all the terms for which @xmath36 does not contain both indices of a pomeron remain : 2 ( wd_2)_3(1,3,5;2,4,6)&= & 8 -30mu _ mp(\\{1, ",
    ",6 } ) m\\{1,2}m\\{3,4}m\\{5,6 } -60mu ( -1)^#mg(135\\m , m,246\\m ) .",
    "& eq : wd2projin words : @xmath36 may contain either 1 or 2 or none of these two indices , and 3 or 4 or neither of them , and 5 or 6 or neither .",
    "this yields @xmath98 terms .",
    "however , two of these vanish because of a property of the @xmath35 function : it vanishes when its first or third argument is empty , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : g-23 ] ) .",
    "this eliminates the terms for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "hence 25 terms remain .",
    "the function @xmath35 is composed of functions with one , two and with three arguments .",
    "the function with one argument , @xmath41 , does not contribute at all to the pomeron vertex .",
    "since its argument always contains all indices , @xmath41 does not survive the projection .",
    "the functions with two arguments , @xmath40 and @xmath5 , are also components of the bfkl kernel",
    ". we will discuss them in the next part of this section .",
    "the functions with three arguments , @xmath39 and @xmath42 , will be dealt with after that .      the functions @xmath40 and @xmath5 survive only if they are convoluted with pomerons in one specific way , namely if each pomeron s arguments are convoluted with different arguments of @xmath40 or  @xmath5 .",
    "this means that both arguments of @xmath40 resp .",
    "@xmath5 contain three indices , one from each pomeron .",
    "first of all , this is the case for the term in ( [ eq : wd2 ] ) where @xmath101 .    besides , there are terms in the sum  ( [ eq : wd2proj ] ) where @xmath36 contains only indices from the first or only from the second group of arguments of  @xmath33 .",
    "since one argument of @xmath40 and @xmath5 contains two arguments of @xmath35 taken together ( see  ( [ eq : g_symb ] ) ) , one of the two @xmath40 and @xmath5 functions would have momenta of different pomerons in each argument and hence would contribute .",
    "however , by replacing @xmath36 by its complement with respect to the group of arguments of @xmath33 , an identical term with opposite sign can be obtained ( unless @xmath36 is identical to the whole group of arguments , but these terms vanish , see above ) .",
    "therefore all such terms cancel out .    to illustrate this ,",
    "let us look at an example .",
    "we again consider the first of the permutations in  ( [ eq : projind ] ) with the spatial function  ( [ eq : wd2_135 ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath102 contains only indices from the first three arguments of  @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding term in the sum contains the following @xmath35 function : the terms with more than three indices in one argument , such as @xmath41 and the second @xmath40 and  @xmath5 functions , vanish because this identifies two coordinates of a pomeron . for",
    "now , we ignore the functions @xmath39 and  @xmath42 ; we will deal with them in the next section .",
    "the remaining terms , @xmath103 and @xmath104 do not vanish .",
    "however , the same terms occur in the term for the complement of @xmath36 , @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath35 function is : again , @xmath103 and @xmath104 remain . but this term has the opposite sign because of the prefactor  @xmath106 .",
    "so the @xmath5 and @xmath40 functions for @xmath107 cancel out .",
    "it can be conjectured that the same mechanism of cancellation occurs in the projection of higher @xmath108 pomeron vertices from @xmath54 reggeised gluon vertices for odd  @xmath6 . ]    only for @xmath101 the functions @xmath40 and  @xmath5 contribute to the @xmath80 pomeron vertex . knowing that @xmath35 becomes a derivative of the bfkl kernel when its middle momentum argument vanishes ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_bfkl ] ) ) , we can immediately write out this term . since there is one such term for each of the four permutations whose colour structure does not vanish , we have to multiply the result by  4 .",
    "we now replace the full amplitude @xmath26 in @xmath35 by the eigenfunction @xmath109 of the bfkl kernel as discussed in section [ sec : pvertices ] and obtain the following bfkl term : 2 v_3^bfkl&= & 8 4 d^2_1d^2_2 a^*(_1,_2 ) b^*(_1,_2 ) c^*(_1,_2 ) & & 1n_c _ 1_2(k_d)(_1,_2 ) & = & 8 4 ( 4_d^2 + 1)^2 a^*(_1,_2 ) b^*(_1,_2 ) & & c^*(_1,_2 ) d(_1,_2 ) & = & 4 2(2)^3 ( _ d)(4_d^2 + 1)^2 12a&&12b12c12d . &",

    "in addition , in the last step we have rewritten the bfkl eigenvalue @xmath110 as a function @xmath111 which was already used in  @xcite .",
    "it differs from @xmath110 only in that it does not contain factors of @xmath3 and the coupling constant : 2 ( ) & = & 2=(,0 ) . & eq : xifigure  [ fig : p3pbfkl ] shows a graphical representation of this part of the vertex .",
    "what remains now are the functions with three arguments , @xmath39 and  @xmath42 .",
    "since they have the same properties ( both vanish only when their first argument , i.e.  the second argument of @xmath35 , is empty ) , they always occur together , and the result of the projection can be expressed in terms of the function @xmath112 defined as 0 ( 2,1,3)&=&2a(2,1,3)-s(2,1,3)-s(2,3,1 ) .",

    "terms which differ only by permutations of the labels ( @xmath113external coordinates ) of the pomerons belong to the same class since they lead to the same type of integral .",
    "the terms from different classes contribute with different signs due to the factor @xmath106 in  ( [ eq : wd2_135 ] ) .",
    "the second class has positive sign , the others negative sign .",
    "the second of the classes presented above can be subdivided further .",
    "it contains those terms for which @xmath36 , and hence the first argument of @xmath112 , contains two indices .",
    "it makes a difference whether the second and third arguments also contain two or whether one has three and the other only one . with this subdivision",

    "there is an intuitive interpretation of these classes which is presented graphically in figure  [ fig : p3palpha ] .",
    "the classes differ in how many pomerons are attached to the different legs of the @xmath112 function .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath112 is symmetric in its last two arguments but not its first , it is easy to see that the four classes are indeed disjoint .",
    "what is more , they are also complete .",
    "it is impossible to construct a term which does not belong to one of the classes ( taking into account the properties of @xmath112 and the pomeron amplitude ) .      before writing down the integrals containing @xmath112 which make up the largest part of the @xmath80 pomeron vertex , let us write down the configuration space form of @xmath112 : 2 ( _ 2,_1,_3 ) & = & 2(2)^3_1_3_2(_1,_3 ) & = & 2(2)^3_1_3_2(_1,_3 ) & = & 2(2)^3_1_3_2(_1,_3 ) & = & 2(2)^3_1_3_2(_1,_3 ) , & eq : alpha_cwhere we have made use of the identity @xmath114 .",
