    "the planck and the electroweak scales are 17 orders of magnitude apart , a fact that makes the theory unstable unless it is fine - tuned . gravity has not been incorporated yet in a consistent way . the dark matter and dark energy are not explained .",
    "there are several asymmetries that we can not account for , including the boson - fermion and the particle - antiparticle asymmetries .",
    "in addition , we can not understand the necessity for more - than - one particle interactions and we would like to see them unified at a higher energy - scale .",
    "either an extension of the sm or a radically new approach is needed in order to address these known problems .    at cdf ,",

    "the two leading susy breaking scenarios are msugra ( susy - breaking is communicated through gravity ; the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the neutralino ) and gmsb ( susy - breaking is communicated with gauge fields ; the lsp is the gravitino ) .",
