    "the inner kiloparsecs of starburst and interacting galaxies harbor stunning amounts of molecular gas , @xmath15 ( e.g. , scoville  1991 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ) . in these environments ,",
    "molecular clouds are subject to intense radiation fields , supernovae explosions , winds from newborn hot stars , strong tidal forces , and gas surface densities several order of magnitudes higher than in the milky way disk . these are also extremely active star formation sites .",
    "knowledge of the physical conditions and structure of molecular gas in interacting systems is essential to understand the starburst activity and its role in galaxy evolution .",
    "arp  299 is an ir - luminous ( @xmath16 l@xmath17 ) merger system of two galaxies , ic  694 and ngc  3690 .",
    "strong  emission has been detected from the nuclei of ic  694 and ngc  3690 and from the interface between the two galaxies ( solomon & sage 1988 ; casoli 1989 ; sargent  1987 ; sargent & scoville 1991 ) .",
    "the two nuclei , as well as the western overlap region , currently harbor intense star formation activity ( c.f .",
    ", gehrz  1983 ; baan & haschick 1990 ) .",
    "furthermore , the nucleus of ic  694 is a flat - spectrum radio source , and may be an agn ( gehrz  1983 ) .",
    "lower resolution ( single dish ) observations reveal an unusually large /  10 line intensity ratio , @xmath18 in arp  299 ( aalto  1991 ; casoli 1992 ) .",
    "these observations left it unclear whether this is due to weak in the whole system or to a varying /  10 line ratio .",
    "observations at 20@xmath19 and 11@xmath19 resolution by casoli ( 1992 ) suggest little variation in the /  10 line ratio and none in the /  21 line ratio .",
    "in contrast , aalto ( 1995 ) note substantial variations at 28@xmath19 resolution in the /  21 ratio : the ratio is about 17 in ic  694 ; close to 9 in ngc  3690 ; and about 7 in the interface region between the two disks .",
    "solomon  ( 1992 ) detected bright hcn emission in 28@xmath19 maps of arp  299 .",
    "they measured /hcn ratios of 11 in ic  694 and 13 in the interface region .",
    "aperture synthesis , , and hcn 10 mapping of arp  299 was carried out with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array between march , 1995 , and february , 1996 .",
    "sis receivers on the six 10.4 m telecopes provided typical system temperatures ( ssb ) of 600 k , 450 k , and 350 k for , , and hcn .",
    "quasars 1150 + 497 and 0917 + 449 were used for phase calibration and uranus and neptune for absolute flux calibraton .",
    "the synthesised beams are @xmath20 for  ( uniform weighting ) , @xmath21 for  ( natural weighting ) , and @xmath22 for hcn ( natural weighting ) . at 2.6 mm wavelength with @xmath0 resolution",
    ", a brightness temperature of 1 k corresponds to 57 mjy beam@xmath23 .",
    "the digital correlator , centered at @xmath24 , provided a total velocity coverage of 1123  for , 1175  for , and 1407  for hcn .",
    "data were binned to 4 mhz resolution , corresponding to 10  for  and  and 13  for hcn . at 110 ghz",
    "an unresolved continuum source of @xmath25 mjy was detected in the center of ic  694 .",
    "continuum emission was also detected in ngc  3690 ( @xmath26 mjy ) and the overlap region ( @xmath27 mjy ) .",
    "we subtracted this continuum emission from the line emission before maps were made .",
    "the main structures found by sargent & scoville ( 1991 ) with the three telescopes array are recovered in our new  map ( figure 1a ) , but our increased @xmath28 coverage enable improved deconvolution . lower surface brightness emission ( a2 ) ,",
    "possibly a molecular disk or bar , extends 10 - 15@xmath19 southeast of the ic  694 nucleus ( a1 ) , coincident with the remnant optical disk .",
    "the center of ngc  3690 ( b1 ) is also surrounded by weak , extended emission ( b2 and b3 ) with a somewhat s - shaped morphology .",
    "where the two galaxies overlap , three distinctive clumps ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ) can now be discerned .",
    "weaker , extended emission is also recovered better in our new map and clumpy structures can be distinguished at the center of the map ( f ) .",
    "these structures appear to connect the major components a , b , and c. in addition , there is a clump ( d ) north of the main features with systemic velocity @xmath29 3280 , which is beyond the bandwidth of the earlier ovro data .",
    "bright 6 cm radio continuum peaks at the nuclei of ic  694 and ngc  3690 ( gehrz  1983 ; condon  1991 ) coincide with the  peaks to within the estimated positional uncertainty ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "there is also reasonable positional agreement between the two brightest  clumps in the overlap region ( c ) and two additional 6 cm radio continuum peaks : c1 and the western radio continuum peak are also coincident within @xmath30 , although the discrepancy between c2 and the eastern radio continuum peak is somewhat larger , @xmath31 .",
    "weaker radio continuum emission at 18 cm and 6 cm is spatially coincident with the extended  emission in regions a2 , b2 , b3 , and f ( baan & haschick 1990 ; gehrz  1983 ) .",
    "the velocity field image ( figure 2 , plate 1 ) reveals a monotonic shift from the blueshifted emission from a2 in ic  694 to redshifted emission from the overlap region c and from region d. velocity gradients within c and d are small .",
    "the velocity field of ngc  3690 is complicated by a double - peaked emission structure of b2 , and both b2 and b3 appear blueshifted relative to the center , b1 .",
    "the nuclei of both ic  694 ( a1 ) and ngc  3690 ( b1 ) remain unresolved by our @xmath32 synthesised beam . a two - dimensional gaussian fit to the nuclear emission of ic  694 and ngc  3690 yields upper limits to the source diameters of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , corresponding to radii of 140 and 150 pc , respectively ( for @xmath35=42 mpc ) .",
    "this implies a lower limit of 18 k to the  brightness temperature in the ic  694 nucleus , and therefore , the cloud filling factor is quite high in the inner 200 pc . even if the intrinsic brightness temperature is as high as 100 k , the surface filling factor of clouds is still almost 20% .",
    "the three features in the overlap region are resolved , with sizes of @xmath36 pc ( c1 ) , @xmath37 pc ( c2 ) , and @xmath38 pc ( c3 ) .",
    "derived properties for all designated regions are presented in table 1 .",
    "the total molecular mass of arp  299 , estimated from @xmath39 m@xmath17 ( @xmath35 is the distance in mpc ; @xmath40 is the integrated  10 line flux in jy k kms@xmath23 ) , is @xmath41 m@xmath17 , 87% of the value estimated by solomon and sage ( 1988 ) from their single dish map .",
    "this formula corresponds to @xmath42(h@xmath43)/@xmath44()=@xmath45 @xmath46 ( k ) @xmath23 ( sargent & scoville 1991 ) , a standard galactic  luminosity to h@xmath43 mass ratio .",
    "the conversion factor may vary , however , across arp  299 , since the line ratios indicate different cloud properties .",
    "the most striking feature of the  10 map ( figure 1b ) is the _ absence of strong emission at the nucleus of ic  694 ( a1)_. emission _ is _ detected in the a2 region of ic  694 , in the overlap region c , and in ngc  3690 .",
    "unlike casoli  ( 1992 ) we find significant variation in the /10 line ratio across arp  299 .",
    "> from the very high value of @xmath4 at the ic  694 nucleus ( a1 ) the ratio drops to @xmath5 in the a2 region .",
    "the global ratio for ngc  3690 is @xmath47 , but there is an indication that the ratio is higher in the nucleus , b1 , than in b2 or b3 .",
    "the ratio for the east ( c3 ) and west ( c1 ) overlap region is @xmath9 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the spatial correlation between the  emission and radio continuum emission peaks is also poor .    as for",
    ", the hcn map ( figure 1c ) is dominated by a peak at the center of ic  694 ( a1 ) , where the /hcn line ratio is @xmath7 .",
    "emission is also detected at the nucleus of ngc  3690 , where the ratio is @xmath8 , and in the western ( c1 ) overlap region , where /hcn= @xmath9 .",
    "there is very little hcn in regions a2 and c3 .",
    "the hcn and  line emission peaks appear anticorrelated .",
    "as a system , arp  299 is not deficient in . in all regions but",
    "the core of ic  694 , we observe /  line ratios typical of star forming regions in other galaxies ( e.g. , aalto  1995 , 1991 ; young & sanders 1986 ; rickard & blitz 1985 ) . relative to ,  10 is brightest in quiescent regions of low  surface brightness , and weak in starburst regions and galactic nuclei . in contrast , hcn 10 , like , is bright in the two galaxy centers and in regions of active star formation .",
    "these line ratio variations are , most likely , caused by differences in line excitation .",
    "our results support the suggestion ( aalto  1995 ) that _ unusually _ high ( i.e. @xmath48 ) /  10 line ratios tend to be associated with extremely compact molecular distributions centered on the nuclei of merging galaxies and are primarily due to a small or moderate optical depth , @xmath10 , in the  10 line .",
    "high ambient pressures , strong tidal forces and ongoing starburst or agn activity lead to substantial changes in cloud structure and physical conditions .",
    "bryant ( 1996 ) also finds that hcn 10 is bright in regions of high  surface brightness in merging galaxies .      the line ratio variation from the ic  694 disk , where /  = 10 and /hcn @xmath49 25 , to its nucleus , where the corresponding values are 60 and 9 , reflects a dramatic change in cloud properties .",
    "the bright hcn line accompanied by relatively weak  emission ( hcn/  = @xmath50 ) implies a population of unusually dense and warm clouds .",
    "the hcn 10 strength implies densities @xmath51 @xmath13 if the hcn excitation is dominated by collisions with h@xmath43 .",
    "it is also likely that the density is @xmath52 , so that most of the hcn population will remain in the lower levels and @xmath53 . at these densities",
    ", the  and  10 transitions are thermalised .",
    "if the kinetic temperature is also high , the lower levels may become significantly depopulated , effectively reducing the optical depth of the 10 line .",
    "then the  21/10 line ratio should be @xmath11 1 . comparing the single dish  21 flux ( aalto  1995 ) with our  10 flux from the nucleus of ic  694 , we estimate  21/10 @xmath54 , implying that the gas temperature is high , @xmath11 50 k. although the single dish beam was large , 28@xmath19 , the bulk ( @xmath5565% ) of the  21 emission within the beam originates in the nucleus of ic  694 ( a1 ) .",
    "since the lower transitions of  and  appear thermalised , lte can be assumed to estimate the  column density , @xmath42 ( ) . we find it unlikely that the /  abundance ratio is extremely high ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "therefore , a high /  10 line ratio indicates a low to moderate optical depth ( @xmath10 ) in the  10 line .",
    "the high intrinsic  10 brightness temperature makes @xmath56 unlikely , and we therefore assume @xmath57 .",
    "the optical depth of the 10 transition can be expressed as @xmath58 .",
    "for a temperature @xmath59=100 k , line width @xmath60 , and @xmath61=1 , the  column density @xmath62 @xmath46 ( per cloud ) and the resulting brightness temperature @xmath63 k. for a density of @xmath64 @xmath13 and a  abundance , [ /h@xmath43]=@xmath66 , the cloud radius @xmath67=0.7 pc  not unlike cores or clumps within giant molecular clouds in the galaxy . at this gas density",
    ", hcn is not thermalised so @xmath68 for the 10 line will be significantly lower than that for . if the abundance ratio [ /hcn ] @xmath69 , then @xmath61(hcn ) is an order of magnitude higher than @xmath61 ( ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath70(hcn ) is sufficiently high to account for a /hcn line ratio of 9 .",
    "above , we infer a clumpy molecular medium because we chose a @xmath71 = 5 , yielding small clouds with @xmath72 pc ( cf aalto 1991 ) .",
    "we can not , however , exclude significantly larger @xmath71 which would indicate a continous , non - cloudy structure  perhaps even a smooth , rotating disk .",
    "a third alternative is a molecular ism consisting of dense clumps surrounded by diffuse , non - cloudy molecular gas ( e.g. aalto 1994,1995 ; dahmen 1996 ) .",
    "molecular line ratio variations are also seen within the overlap region c , albeit smaller than those within ic  694 .",
    "the weakest  and strongest hcn 10 emission , relative to , is found in c1 , the location of the brightest h@xmath73 emission in arp  299 ( gehrz  1983 ) .",
    "continuum emission at 3.4 @xmath74 m and 10@xmath74 m also peaks close to the c1 clump .",
    "thus , c1 appears to be currently the most active starforming region within c. we suggest that the observed molecular line ratio gradients are the result of a temperature and/or density gradient across the overlap region .",
    "the /  10 line ratio in c1 is considerably lower than in the nucleus of ic  694 , perhaps because c1 is an extranuclear starburst .    unlike",
    ", the  emission peak is not connected with the nucleus of ngc  3690 ( b1 ) .",
    "the radial excitation gradient is similar , therefore , to that of ic  694 , with the highest /  line ratio in the central region .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  3690 , with intense associated h@xmath73 emission , is a site of starburst activity ( gehrz 1983 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that high /  intensity ratios in mergers are caused by unusually high isotopic abundance ratios in molecular clouds with optically thick  10 lines .",
    "an influx of very low metallicity gas from the outer disk of the galaxies is the proposed cause of such an extreme abundance ratio ( e.g. casoli 1992 ; henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) .",
    "since the /  intensity ratio is normal in the outskirts of ic  694 and ngc  3690 this scenario is unlikely to be the explanation for arp  299 .",
    "instead , the measured line ratio variations most likely indicate differences in the line excitation and gas properties in different parts of the system .",
    "the observed /  10 line ratio is , however , a lower limit to the /abundance ratio in the emitting region and for @xmath61 ( ) @xmath75 this implies an abundance ratio not much greater than 60 in the center of ic  694 .",
    "this value is typical for gmcs in the galactic disk , but higher than in the inner region of our galaxy , where the ratio is @xmath76 ( langer & penzias 1990 ) .",
    "perhaps the ism in the nucleus of ic  694 recently arrived from the disk of the galaxy . in this case , the difference in line ratio between a2 and a1 is solely caused by a dramatic change in mean optical depth of the  line . on the other hand , selective photodissociation of  by a starburst and/or an agn may change the isotopic abundance ratio . a young nuclear starburst may also produce extra @xmath77c and thus temporarily increase the @xmath77c/@xmath78c abundance ratio ( e.g. , henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) .",
    "the /  10 line ratio varies dramatically within arp  299 , from @xmath4 at the nucleus of ic  694 to 5 - 10 in its disk and in the eastern and north interface regions ( c3 and d ) .",
    "the  10 brightness , relative to , is high in quiescent regions of low  surface brightness , and low in starburst regions and galactic nuclei .",
    "in contrast , hcn 10 is bright in the two galaxy centers and in the active extranuclear star formation region .",
    "10 is @xmath7 at the nucleus of ic  694 , @xmath8 for ngc  3690 and @xmath9 for the extranuclear starburst region c1 .",
    "unusually high /  line ratios ( @xmath11 20 ) appear to be associated with extremely compact molecular distributions in the nuclei of merging galaxies ( cf .",
    "aalto  1995 ) .    the large /  10 intensity ratio at the nucleus of ic  694 can be attributed to low to moderate optical depth ( @xmath10 ) in the  10 line , possibly combined with abundance effects . a medium consisting of dense ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , warm ( @xmath79 50 k )",
