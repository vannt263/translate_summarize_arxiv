    "a rich variety of electronic ground states of transition metal oxides ( tmos ) emerges from strong electron correlations and cooperative phenomena with competing interactions , including the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 , crystal - electric field ( cef ) , and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "the transition from elements with 3d via 4d to 5d valence orbitals progressively results in larger single particle band width @xmath7 , reduced @xmath6 , and enhanced soc .",
    "tmos of the type @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( 3d ) , @xmath10 ( 4d ) , or @xmath11 ( 5d ) , allow one to consider the magnitudes of these interactions as variable parameters which can significantly influence the electronic structure within the same layered perovskite 214 structure .",

    "its 5d counterpart @xmath1 represents , in turn , a prototype spin - orbit mott insulator @xcite . in the presence of strong soc , the five @xmath4 states of the @xmath15 ions with 5d@xmath16 electron configuration form bands described by the effective quantum numbers @xmath5=3/2 and @xmath5=1/2 .",
    "the latter , which is half - filled , is split already by moderate @xmath6 into a lower and upper hubbard band , opening the spin - orbit mott gap .",
    "the magnetic interactions in @xmath1 also bear a resemblance to those in @xmath12 and can be described within an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with an effective spin 1/2 on a quasi two - dimensional square lattice @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a low temperature @xmath17-wave gap @xcite and a splitting of the fermi surface into so - called separated fermi - arcs @xcite in electron doped @xmath1 , which are hallmarks of the doped cuprates @xcite , have recently been reported .",
    "these findings underscore the similarity of the the low - energy effective physics of @xmath1 and that of the superconducting cuprates , and they encourage further research to elucidate the relationship between mott physics and superconductivity and to search for new routes to high-@xmath18 superconductivity .    infrared and optical spectroscopies provide valuable information about the low - energy excitations , charge dynamics , and electron correlations in this class of materials .",
    "the in - plane conductivity spectra of single crystals of @xmath1 have been systematically studied @xcite and show evidence of the cooperative electron correlation and soc effects in the presence of the orbital - dependent electron - phonon interaction . to make further inferences about the electronic structure and underlying interactions in the layered iridate @xmath1",
    ", the interplane response needs to be carefully examined ; likewise in the ruthenates and cuprates@xcite , where valuable information about the interplane coupling , phonon anomalies , the pseudo - gap phase and precursor cooper - pair formation has been drawn from studies of the interlayer electrodynamics .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2-axis optical conductivity data , along with the in - plane spectra , can be used to significantly constrain the model parameters for band structure calculations , such as the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath6 .    a thorough and reliable study of the interplane response is impeded by the small size of the currently available crystals along the @xmath2-axis , orthogonal to the @xmath0 planes .",
    "the interplane optical conductivity measured on @xmath19-axis - oriented @xmath1 epitaxial films @xcite is obscured by the substrate contribution and by the distorted electronic structure caused by the anisotropic biaxial strains @xcite .",

    "section  [ sec : details ] describes experimental and computational details . in section  [ sec : phonons ] , the far - ir in- and out - of - plane phonon spectra are reported , followed by group theory analysis of the zone - center phonons and first - principles lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the optical anisotropy of the interband transitions is discussed in section  [ sec : optical ] . in section  [ sec : lda ] relativistic calculations , which use the local spin density approximation + u ( lsda+u ) approach to account for the on - site coulomb interaction u simultaneously with strong spin - orbit coupling , are reported in order to explain the observed anomalies and the anisotropy of the optical response .",

    "the plate - like crystals mechanically extracted from the crucible had lateral dimensions of about in the @xmath24-plane and thicknesses less than in the @xmath2-direction . in order to gain a sample thickness along the @xmath2-axis that is sufficient for optical spectroscopy we prepared stacks of about 10 to 15 individual single crystals glued on top of each other by a minimal amount of ge - varnish .",
    "the crystals were co - aligned according to their in - plane crystallographic axes using laue x - ray back scattering .",
    "subsequently one @xmath25-face of the stack was polished with dry polishing paper .",

    "the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 was varied in the range from 1.15ev to 2.15ev and hund s coupling @xmath33 was fixed to the value estimated from lsda .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath34 , which crudely determines the splitting between the lower and upper hubbard bands , varied between 0.5 and 1.5ev .",

    "far - ir ( open symbols ) and mid - ir ( closed symbols ) data were taken at different angles of incidence and overlap in the spectral range from to . while there is certainly a finite spread in the alignment of individual single crystals of the stacks prepared for the @xmath2-axis measurements there is no significant `` contamination '' from the in - plane response into the out - of - plane response as already evident from the raw data .",

    "this might be attributed to the stacking procedure of many single crystals with enhanced contribution of the near - surface regions into the @xmath2-axis optical response .",
    "mechanical polishing as applied here can also induce strain effects in the surface layer which might significantly decrease the phonon lifetime @xcite , although the large penetration depth of far - ir radiation ( of the order of several micrometers ) increases significantly the bulk sensitivity , hence averaging out pure surface effects .",

    "all modes belonging to the same irreducible representation ( here either @xmath59 or @xmath58 ) are allowed to mix in order to form the eigenmodes of the ion lattice excited by infrared photons .",
    "if an irreducible representation embodies both in- and out - of - plane polarizations this intermixing can lead to allowed phonons both in the in - plane and out - of - plane response .",
    "the large unit cell of four formula units , which adds up to 28 atoms per unit cell , and the reduced crystal symmetry makes a phonon calculation computationally expensive but indispensable for further insights on the lattice dynamics .",
    "therefore we compare our experimentally extracted phonon parameters with results from lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the set of calculated zone center phonon frequencies is summarized in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "we quantify the degree of @xmath2-axis polarization of each phonon eigenmode by looking at the projection @xmath30 of the normalized eigenvector @xmath63 onto the @xmath24-plane , @xmath64 , and @xmath2-axis , @xmath65 , respectively , with @xmath66 in the range [ 0,1 ] .",

    "surprisingly , the temperature dependence of the @xmath2-axis response is rather weak up to room temperature .",
    "this low - energy @xmath2-axis optical response can be understood in terms of an indirect gap .",
    "phonon assisted absorption across an indirect optical gap involves essentially two processes . when the photon is absorbed an additional phonon",

    "[ fig : lda](b ) ] we identify three major features . beside the discussed double peak structure",
    "the next set of interband transitions sets in around concurrent with the @xmath2-axis response but at somewhat lower frequency than in the experimental spectra .",
    "from there a plateau reaches out to about followed by a further rise peaking at with approximately half the strength of the @xmath2-axis response .",
    "the weak feature around seen in the experiment might find its counterpart at in the calculation .",
    "along the brillouin zone boundaries , for example between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure ] ) , we find an indirect optical gap of about .",
    "this could indeed enable phonon mediated indirect transitions , which as second order processes are beyond our calculations .",
    "these transitions may contribute to the hump in the @xmath2-axis response as well as the strongly temperature dependent absorption edge tail and far - ir background seen in the @xmath24-plane .",
    "the latter has also been shown to be relevant for @xmath114 , the narrow band gap bilayer analogue@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of a stacking approach of single crystals to extract the @xmath2-axis optical conductivity of @xmath1 as proven by a distinct phonon spectrum , which is in full accordance with lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the observed uniaxial anisotropy in the infrared excitation spectrum is consistent with the suggested novel @xmath99 ground state within the lsda+u band structure calculations .",
    "the absence of the characteristic ir double peak structure in the out - of - plane response is explained by vanishing dipole matrix elements .",
    "the additional information from the @xmath2-axis response severely constrains the parameter space for calculations .",
    "our comprehensive investigation of the optical response of a prototypical spin - orbit mott insulator thus provides an excellent basis for experiments on doped layered iridates , which are promising candidates for exotic ground states including unconventional superconductivity .",
