    "as is well known , mathematics is very important to physics .",
    "the goal of theoretical physics is to construct mathematical models to explain the physical universe .",
    "a good theory is a model which can successfully predict the outcomes of many different experiments on many different physical properties . yet",
    "it is not clear why mathematics should be so successful in constructing good theories .",
    "there does not seem to be a basic a priori reason why the physical world should be so amenable to description by mathematical theories .",
    "this problem has bothered many others , including this author .",
    "paper @xcite , on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences , engendered other papers on the relationship between mathematics and physics @xcite .",
    "all this work recognizes how closely entwined physics and mathematics are . a paper by tegmark @xcite expresses this in an extreme fashion by claiming physics _ is _ mathematics .",
    "one approach to this problem is to work towards development of a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together @xcite .",
    "such a theory would be expected to treat physics and mathematics as one coherent whole rather than as two separate disciplines .",
    "development of such a theory requires that one have some idea of what physics and mathematics are .",
    "there is an enormous literature on the nature and foundations of mathematics . here",
    "these questions will be bypassed by assuming that mathematics includes the description and properties of many different mathematical systems . here",
    "mathematical systems are defined @xcite as structures consisting of a base set , a few basic operations , relations , and constants . for each system type",
    "the structures are required to satisfy axioms relevant to the system type .",
    "examples are structures for the rational numbers@xmath8 that satisfy the axioms for the smallest ordered field @xcite , the complex numbers , @xmath9 that satisfy , axioms for an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath0 @xcite and hilbert spaces@xmath10 that satisfy axioms for a complex , normed , inner product space that is complete in a norm defined from the inner product , @xcite .",
    "scalar vector multiplication is denoted by @xmath11 and a generic vector is denoted by @xmath12 .    here",
    "mathematics is considered to consist of a large collection of structures for the different types of mathematical systems . for each type of system",
    "many structures are possible .",
    "thesee are all part of mathematics",
    ". the structures can differ in that the base sets can be different .",
    "also how the basic operations and relations are defined can change .",
    "the only requirement among the many structures of a given type is that structure @xmath13 satisfies the axioms for the type if and only if structure @xmath14 does .",
    "the connection to physics begins with the assumption that mathematics is local .",
    "this assumption means that a collection , @xmath15 of mathematical systems of different types is associated with each space time point @xmath6 of a manifold , @xmath16 .",
    "in addition the mathematics available to an observer or intelligent being , @xmath17 is assumed to be limited to that in @xmath18    this assumption is based on the idea that the mathematics available to @xmath19 is that which is stored in his brain . at any time @xmath1 the mathematics in an observers brain is a subset of that in @xmath18 mathematical information in a textbook or described in a seminar is not available to @xmath19 until the information has reached @xmath20 brain .",
    "in addition , to keep things simple , the assumption is made here that an observer , or more specifically his brain , can be localized at a point .",
    "this is clearly false as storage and use of a large amount of information requires a finite space time volume @xcite .",
    "note that the the totality of mathematics available to an observer at @xmath6 is limited to that within @xmath18 it follows that @xmath21 must be large enough to include the mathematics used by physics .",
    "it must also be such that @xmath19 can describe relations and maps between systems in @xmath21 and systems in @xmath22 at other points @xmath23 systems in @xmath21 are used for such descriptions .",
    "maps between systems in @xmath22 and @xmath21 play an important role in this work .",
    "they start with maps on the different types of numbers .",
    "these are then extended to other types of systems that include numbers in their description ( such as vector spaces , algebras , group representation or any system that includes multiplication by scalars ) .",
    "these maps are isomorphisms between structures at different points .",
    "they are also parallel transforms @xcite in that they correspond to or define the notion of `` same value as '' between elements at different points",
    ".    for example let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be complex number structures at @xmath6 and @xmath5 define the map @xmath26 by @xmath27 the element @xmath28 has the same value in @xmath29 as @xmath30 has in @xmath31 @xmath32 denotes the four field operations , @xmath33    for hilbert spaces , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , one has a similar isomorphic map @xmath36 where @xmath37",
    "the next step taken in the approach used here and in other work , @xcite , is to introduce scaling between mathematical systems at different points .",
    "scaling can be done for each type of number system .",
    "for example , let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be real number structures at points @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath40 a positive real number in @xmath41 define the scaled representation of @xmath42 on @xmath43 by the structure , @xmath44 to save on notation , @xmath40 is denoted here by @xmath45 the scaled structure can also be represented by @xmath46    this shows that in the scaled structure , the number value , @xmath47 corresponds to the number value , @xmath48 in @xmath49 the addition and subtraction operations are unchanged , multiplication in @xmath38 corresponds to multiplication and division by @xmath48 in @xmath49 division in @xmath38 corresponds to division and multiplication by @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath0 are the same in the scaled representation of @xmath38 on @xmath39 as they are in @xmath41 in general any number value @xmath51 in @xmath38 corresponds to the number value @xmath52 in @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the same number value in @xmath39 as @xmath51 is in @xmath55    the definitions of the scaled operations , @xmath56 in terms of those in @xmath57 are not arbitrary .",
    "they must be such that @xmath58 satisfies the real number axioms , for a complete ordered field @xcite , if and only if @xmath39 does .",
    "[ rrx ] and [ rxr ] satisfy these conditions .",
    "the transformations between the structures , with scaling included , can be defined by factoring @xmath59 into two isomorphisms as in @xmath60 where @xmath61 note that the usual case with no scaling is the special case here where @xmath62 then @xmath63 is the identity and @xmath64    the introduction of scaling requires that one drop the association of elements of the base set to specific number values .",
    "for example , the above shows that the element of the base set @xmath65 that has value @xmath40 in @xmath39 has value @xmath66 in @xmath53 this shows that base set elements have no intrinsic values .",
    "the elements of @xmath65 acquire values only within the structure containing them .",
    "they are different for different structures .",
    "the only exception is the element with value @xmath0 in a structure .",
    "this value is invariant under scaling transformations . in this sense @xmath0",
    "corresponds to the number vacuum .",
    "this description of scaling extends to other types of numbers . for complex numbers",
    "it can be taken over directly . here the scaled representation , @xmath67 of @xmath29 on @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 scaling applies to rational numbers provided they are regarded as subsets of real or complex numbers , the same holds for integers and natural numbers .",
    "scaling affects all systems that include scalars in their structures ( such as closure under multiplication by scalars ) .",
    "vector spaces , algebras , group representations are examples of these systems .",
    "for example the scaled representation , @xmath70 of the hilbert space @xmath71 on @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 more details on scaling are given in @xcite .",

    "the effect of scaling on physics is based on the observation that any comparisons of , or operations on numbers , that are associated with two different space time locations , include the effects of scaling .",
    "the reason is that comparisons or operations are not defined for numbers in different structures at different locations .",
    "they are defined only within structures .",
    "this means that any theoretical physics expressions that involve integrals or derivatives over space , time , or space time must include scaling as these operations require use of number values or other mathematical elements in different structures at different locations .",
    "an example of the effect of scaling and locality of mathematics is the replacement of the usual expression of a wave packet @xmath93 by @xmath94the subscript @xmath6 means that the integral is evaluated in mathematical systems at @xmath3 each vector value of the integrand is transferred , with scaling , to a vector in @xmath95 here , and in much of the following , the scaling factor will be assumed to be defined by a scalar field , @xmath96 as is done in eqs . [ ryxnt ] and [ rtxy ] .",
    "the problem with the usual expression for a wave packet is that , with local availability of mathematics , the integral in @xmath97 as the limit of a sum of vectors for different space locations , is not defined .",
    "the reason is that the integrands belong to different hilbert spaces , with @xmath98 a vector in @xmath99 linear superposition is defined only within hilbert space structures , not between different structures .",
    "this problem can be fixed by use of parallel transformation operators , @xmath100 without scaling present .",
    "the inclusion of scaling , shown in eq .",
    "[ psixsc ] , follows from the additional assumption of the freedom of choice of number structures , and structures based on numbers , at different space and time locations .",
    "this is similar to the freedom of choice of bases in vector spaces as used in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "inclusion of scaling also affects the momentum operator in quantum mechanics .",

    "scaling also affects the variation of @xmath122 to obtain the equations of motion in that extra terms involving the derivatives of @xmath96 appear in the euler lagrange equations .",

    "the absence of experimental evidence for scaling in measurements of properties of quantum mechanical systems implies that for all locations @xmath156 for which amplitudes @xmath157 and @xmath158 are not negligible , one must have @xmath159 to within experimental error . the size of the region within which this equation holds is determined by the fact that quantum states , @xmath12 , at least those that are prepared and measured by observers , have negligible amplitudes outside a region that is small on a laboratory scale .",
    "it follows that the integral over all space , as in eq .",
    "[ psixsc ] , can be restricted to a small region .    here",

    "it follows that , for all points @xmath156 in @xmath160 @xmath162 and @xmath163 however , this restriction does not apply for points outside @xmath161 .",
    "thus @xmath164 is possible for most of the universe .",
    "also the fact that scaling depends on @xmath165 and on differences only between values of @xmath96 means that one is free to choose a value of @xmath96 at some point without affecting scaling . here",

    "this is the case even if scaling is not negligible in @xmath161 and the computations and experiments are done in @xmath161 .",
    "the reason is that the output of a computation or measurement at @xmath5 is not a real number in @xmath55 it is a physical system in a state @xmath168 that is interpreted as a number in @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath169 is the interpretative map at @xmath5 , then @xmath170 denotes the numerical output at @xmath5 .",
    "assume that another computation or measurement at @xmath6 gives an output state @xmath171 .",
    "the number value associated with this is given by @xmath172 as a number in @xmath41    comparison of outputs of these two operations , one at @xmath6 and one at @xmath5 does not involve comparison of the number values , @xmath170 and @xmath173 such a comparison would include a scaling factor between @xmath38 and @xmath41 instead the comparison is done by physically transmitting the states @xmath168 and @xmath171 ( or the relevant information contained in the states ) to a common point @xmath7 where the outputs can be compared locally . if @xmath174 and @xmath175 denote the transmissions ,",
    "then comparison of the outputs of these two operations consists of a comparison of the number values , @xmath176 and @xmath177 since both numbers are in @xmath178 no scaling is needed .",
    "these considerations suggest that , if number scaling plays a role in physics or geometry , then its role is limited to cosmological aspects of both physics and geometry .",
    "any influence of number scaling on physics and geometry is , at most , limited to events and properties of systems that are far away in either space or time or in space time . of incoming photons or particles .",
    "one can include operations with measurements on these incoming signals , but the operations are all local .",
    "one can not go far away to prepare these signals or to influence them . ]",
    "as has been shown elsewhere @xcite , local availability of mathematics and number scaling have an effect on geometry .",
    "this is a consequence of the assignment of separate real number structures , @xmath39 , to each point , @xmath136 of @xmath16 instead of just one structure , @xmath179 , common to all @xmath3 affected aspects of geometry include coordinate systems , line elements , and path lengths .",
    "these are discussed here as examples of the effect of local availability of mathematics and number scaling on geometry .",
    "a consequence of the local availability of mathematics is that for each point , @xmath136 the coordinate system @xmath180 associated with a point , @xmath136 in an @xmath134 dimensional manifold , @xmath16 , is described by real number tuples in @xmath181 the origin of @xmath180 can be anywhere .",

    "three of the infinitely many coordinate systems , one for each point , are shown .",
    "since @xmath196 and @xmath197 are identical to @xmath198 it follows that the parallel transform maps convert @xmath180 into a globally valid coordinate system , at least for euclidean and minkowski spaces .",

    "this is good because it follows that theoretical predictions in physics , expressed as equations , are the same at all points , even with scaling present .",
