    "the landauer - bttiker ( lb ) formalism has for some time provided a reliable method for modelling coherent transport through molecular junctions @xcite . in the original formulation , this method enabled computation of the current in the leads coupled to a molecular region c , when a bias in at least one of the leads causes a constant shift in the fermi energies of the leads .",
    "work done with the lb formalism has mainly focused on the calculation of steady - state properties , corresponding to a time regime that consigns the bias switch - on time to the distant past @xcite .",
    "the lb expressions for the current and quantum noise may be derived from the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism , which is a more general alternative to the s - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "this requires the solution of the kadanoff - baym equations for the lesser green s function of the molecular region @xcite , from which the electric current in the leads and electron number in the molecule may be extracted .",
    "when the bias is time - independent , all gfs are functions of the time difference , and hence it is possible to work purely in the frequency domain when solving for the components that enter the expression for the current .",
    "however , recent studies have opened up the possibility of calculating the time - dependent ( td ) current in a multilevel nanojunction using a closed integral formula ; expressions that include the transient effects of the switch - on ( and hence the system preparation ) have been derived for the cases of a constant @xcite and time - dependent @xcite bias .",
    "common to both approaches is the assumption of the wide - band limit approximation ( wbla ) , which neglects the detailed electronic structure of the leads and renders the kadanoff - baym equations for the lesser gf analytically tractable .",
    "computationally , the main cost of the method we presented in @xcite lies with the evaluation of several integrals in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present an efficient computational scheme for evaluating these integrals with no loss of accuracy making consideration of complex multi - level and multi - terminal systems within the wbla numerically possible .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the model of the generic switch - on problem and the basic assumptions involved in the wbla .",
    "in addition we prove a continuity equation for the current formula derived in @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "the formula for the current is re - expressed using the pad expansion of the fermi function to remove all frequency integrals , forming the basis for our numerical implementation .",
    "section 4 presents numerical results for the current through a molecular wire , modelled with a simple tight - binding hamiltonian . in this implementation , expressions are worked out for a sinusoidal bias whereby bessel function expansions are used to remove all @xmath3integrals in the td current .",
    "this enables simulations of the transport resulting from any combination of sinusoidal biases in the leads , including those which contain a symmetry - breaking phase .",
    "furthermore it enables us to identify some novel finite size effects on the dynamics and to study the conservation of charge as the transient current dies out .",
    "the negf formalism is a method for calculating the evolution in time of ensemble averages , following an event at a particular time @xmath4 which breaks the physical symmetry of the system between times @xmath5 . in quantum transport",
    "one is primarily concerned with calculations of the time - dependent current following the switch - on of a bias in one of the leads . here",
    "we model this switch - on by adding a spatially constant time - dependent shift to the lead energy levels .",
    "we will in general be concerned with the following hamiltonian :    @xmath6\\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are annihilation and creation operators of leads and central system electronic states , where for simplicity spin degrees of freedom are neglected .",
    "we collect elements of this hamiltonian into a matrix consisting of ` blocks ' corresponding to each of the physical subsystems it describes .",
    "the first term is a hamiltonian of the lead states @xmath11 belonging to each lead @xmath12 .",
    "the second term is the hamiltonian of the molecule coupled to the lead ; it contains inter - molecular hopping matrix elements @xmath13 between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 molecular orbitals , defining a molecular hamiltonian matrix ` block ' @xmath16 with elements @xmath13 .",
    "the third term describes the coupling of the molecule to the leads , and defines the @xmath17 ` block ' of the hamiltonian matrix , @xmath18 with elements @xmath19 .",
    "the switch - on problem is specified by assigning values to the matrix elements of @xmath20 at times before and after @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that , prior to @xmath4 , the system has equilibrated with lead - molecule couplings present in the hamiltonian @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 is as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with time - independent lead state energies @xmath23 .",
    "the system is therefore described by an equilibrium density operator @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the partition function , @xmath26 the number operator , @xmath27 the inverse temperature and @xmath28 the chemical potential . at times following the switch - on , the lead energies acquire a time - dependent shift , @xmath29 , where the function @xmath30 is arbitrary .",
    "this is an example of a _ partition - free _",
    "approach @xcite to the switch - on problem , as the system hamiltonian is not divided into decoupled subregions prior to @xmath4 .",
    "_ partitioned _ approaches @xcite add the lead - molecule coupling at the switch - on time and therefore can not be expected to give a physically meaningful transient .",
    "the problem of calculating the current in response to this kind of switch - on is mapped to the solution of a set of coupled integro - differential equations for green s functions ( gfs ) defined on a complex time contour @xmath31 , which we refer to as the konstantinov - perel contour @xcite .",
    "one then solves for various components of the two - time gf of the central region @xmath32 ` block ' , whose rigorous definition may be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we simply note that the retarded gf satisfies the following equation of motion :    @xmath33    on the right - hand side of this expression , one encounters the retarded component of the embedding self - energy ,    @xmath34_{mn}=\\sum_{\\alpha}e^{-i\\psi_{\\alpha}\\left(t_{1},t_{2}\\right)}\\int\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}e^{i\\omega\\left(t_{1}-t_{2}\\right)}\\left[\\lambda_{\\alpha , mn}\\left(\\omega\\right)-\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_{\\alpha , mn}\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right]\\label{eq : self - energy}\\ ] ]    we have in this expression introduced the level width matrix @xmath35 which forms a hilbert transform pair with @xmath36 .",
    "in addition we have defined the phase factor : @xmath37 in the wbla , one assumes that @xmath38 is replaced with a frequency - independent value @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the equilibrium fermi energy of lead @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "all other components of the gf can also be explicitly calculated in the time domain @xcite .",

    "the condition for local charge conservation is that the sum of all currents measured in the leads of a multiterminal device is equal to zero :    @xmath50    this condition states that the rate of charge entering the molecular region is balanced by the rate of charge leaving it .",

    "the first type of decay is a well - known effect , and has been studied before for static @xcite and td @xcite biases .",
    "the latter type of decay is characterized by the fact that the signal retains its shape throughout , and also by a decay time which is related to sparseness of the level - width matrix .",
    "we anticipate that this double decay effect will be observable in more realistic extended systems than the one considered here , and that the formalism developed here provides a fast way to access transient properties in those systems .",
