    "ramsey theory is an old and important area of combinatorics . since the original result of 1930 by f.  ramsey @xcite research developed in several directions , but the crux of the matter remains the study of regularities that must arise in large combinatorial structures .",
    "these kinds of regularities classically concern substructures formed by _ all - equal _ elements ( e.g. , a monochromatic clique in an edge - colored graph ) .",
    "however , at the beginning of the 70s , erds , simonovits and t. ss @xcite started the study of _ anti - ramsey _ theory , that is , the study of regularities that concern _ all - distinct _ objects ( e.g. , a subgraph of an edge - colored graph in which all edges have different colors , often called a _ rainbow _",
    " see @xcite for a survey ) .    in combinatorics on words ,",
    "ramsey theory found applications through some important results stating the existence of unavoidable regularities .",
    "formally , an _ unavoidable regularity _ is a property @xmath5 such that it is not possible to construct arbitrarily long words not satisfying @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "most of the main results about unavoidable regularities in words were originally stated in other areas of combinatorics , e.g. , the ramsey , van der waerden and shirshov theorems ( see  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "all these theorems , however , establish the existence , in every sufficiently long word , of regular substructures . in this paper",
    ", we give an anti - ramsey result in the context of combinatorics on words .",
    "regularities in words are often associated with _ repetitions _ , also called _",
    "powers_. a power of order @xmath0 is a concatenation of @xmath0 identical copies of the same word . the most simple power is a square ( a power of order @xmath6 ) .",
    "as noted by thue in 1906 @xcite , every sufficiently long binary word must contain a square , but there exist arbitrarily long words over a @xmath2-letter alphabet avoiding squares , that is , not containing any square as a block of contiguous letters ( in terms of combinatorics on words , a _ factor _ ) .",
    "this shows that the avoidability of powers depends on the alphabet size .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the notion of an anti - power .",
    "an anti - power of order @xmath0 , or simply a _ @xmath0-anti - power _ , is a concatenation of @xmath0 consecutive pairwise distinct words of the same length .",
    "e.g. , @xmath7 is a @xmath3-anti - power .",
    "a simple computation shows that there are in general much more anti - powers than powers for a fixed length and a fixed order ; yet there are much less anti - powers than possible factors of the same given length .",
    "let us consider as an example the well - known thue - morse word @xmath8 starting from @xmath9 , the @xmath10-th term is given by the parity of the number of @xmath11s in the binary expansion of @xmath10 .",

    "the first few lengths of the shortest prefixes of @xmath19 that are @xmath0-anti - powers for different values of @xmath0 are displayed in table  [ tab : tm ] .",
    "a natural question is therefore the following : given an integer @xmath1 , is it always possible to find a prefix of @xmath19 that is a @xmath0-anti - power ? in this paper we answer this question in the affirmative . actually , we prove a much stronger result . indeed , we prove that the existence of powers of any order or anti - powers of any order is an unavoidable regularity :    [ thm : main ] every infinite word contains powers of any order or anti - powers of any order .",
    "note that we do not make any hypothesis on the alphabet size .",
    "actually , we prove a stronger result , from which theorem [ thm : main ] follows . given an infinite word @xmath20 , we prove that if for some integer @xmath0 the lower density of the set of lengths @xmath10 for which the prefix of @xmath20 of length @xmath21 is a @xmath0-anti - power is smaller than one , then there exists a word ( whose length depends on @xmath0 ) that occurs in @xmath20 with arbitrary exponent ( theorem [ prop : luca ] ) .",
    "this implies that if an infinite word @xmath20 has the property that each of its factors appears with bounded exponent ( in the terminology of combinatorics on words , an _ @xmath22-power - free _ word ) , then @xmath20 must begin in an anti - power of order @xmath0 for every choice of @xmath23 in particular , since a uniformly recurrent word is either purely periodic or @xmath22-power - free , this property holds for every aperiodic uniformly recurrent word , as for example the thue - morse word or any sturmian word .    in the second part of the paper , we focus on the avoidability of anti - powers .",
    "we show that any infinite word avoiding @xmath2-anti - powers is ultimately periodic , and that there exist aperiodic words avoiding @xmath3-anti - powers .",
