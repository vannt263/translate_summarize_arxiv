    "in the semi - classical limit chaotic quantum systems very often exhibit universal behavior , in the sense that several of their characteristic quantities agree with the respective quantities found for certain ensembles of random matrices . via trace formulas ,",
    "such quantities can be illustrated as suitable sums over the periodic orbits of the underlying classical dynamical system .",
    "for instance , the two - point correlator function is expressed by a double sum over periodic orbits @xmath2 where @xmath3 abbreviates the average over the energy and over a small time window , @xmath4 denotes the heisenberg time and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the amplitude , the action , and the period of the orbit @xmath8 , respectively .    the diagonal approximation @xmath9 to ( [ formfactor ] ) studied by hannay / ozorio de almeida @xcite and berry @xcite in the 1980 s contributes to the first order @xmath10 to ; see also @xcite . to next orders , as @xmath11 , the main term from ( [ formfactor ] ) arises owing to those orbit pairs @xmath12 for which the action difference @xmath13 is ` small ' .",
    "this was first considered by sieber and richter @xcite , who predicted that a given periodic orbit with a small - angle self - crossing in configuration space will admit a partner orbit with almost the same action .",
    "the original orbit and its partner are called a sieber - richter pair . in phase space ,",
    "a sieber - richter pair contains a region where two stretches of each orbit are almost mutually time - reversed and one addresses this region as a _ @xmath14-encounter _ or , more strictly , a _ @xmath14-antiparallel encounter _ ; the ` 2 ' stands for two orbit stretches which are close in configuration space , and ` antiparallel ' means that the two stretches have opposite directions ( see figure [ 2encounter ] ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that sieber - richter pairs contribute to the spectral form factor the second order term @xmath15 , and it turned out that the result agreed with what is obtained using random matrix theory @xcite , for certain symmetry classes .",
    "this discovery prompted an increased research activity on the subject matter in the following years and finally led to an expansion @xmath16 for the orthogonal ensemble ( the symmetry class relevant for time - reversal invariant systems ) to all orders in @xmath17 , by including the higher - order encounters also ; see @xcite , and in addition @xcite , which provide much more background and many further references .    to establish a more detailed mathematical understanding , we start on the classical side and try to prove the existence of partner orbits and derive good estimates for the action differences of the orbit pairs . for @xmath14-encounters",
    "this was done in the previous work @xcite , where we considered the geodesic flow on compact factors of the hyperbolic plane ; in this case the action of a periodic orbit is proportional to its length .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a @xmath18-periodic orbit of the geodesic flow crossing itself in configuration space at a time @xmath19 has a unique partner orbit that remains @xmath20-close to the original one and the action difference between them is approximately equal @xmath21 with the estimated error @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the crossing angle ( see figure [ 2encounter ] ) , and this proved the accuracy of sieber / richter s prediction in @xcite mentioned above . in this paper , we continue considering this hyperbolic dynamical system to deal with the technically more involved higher - order encounters .    in the physics community this system is often called the hadamard - gutzwiller model , and it has frequently been studied @xcite ; further related work includes @xcite .",
    "for instance , heusler et al.@xcite identified the term @xmath24 and it was shown that there are 5 families of orbit pairs contributing to @xmath24 : 3 families of orbits with two single 2-encounters and 2 families of orbits with 3-encounters . in that way one obtains whole bunches of periodic orbits with controlled and small mutually action difference .",
    "generalizing these ideas , in @xcite the expansion of @xmath25 to all orders in @xmath17 could be derived .",
    "here a key point was to consider encounters where more than two orbit stretches are involved ; see also @xcite .",
    "we speak of an _ @xmath0-encounter _ when @xmath0 stretches of a periodic orbit are mutually close to each other up to time reversal . for a precise definition",
    "one may pick one of @xmath0 encounter stretches as a reference and demand that none of the @xmath26 companions be further away than some small distance ; see @xcite .",
    "in other words , all the @xmath0 stretches must intersect a small poincar section .",
    "the orbit enters the _ encounter region _ through _ entrance ports _ and leaves it through _ exit ports_. using hyperbolicity , one can switch connections between entrance ports and exit ports to get new orbits which still remain close to the original one ; and they are called _",
    "partner orbits_. however , not all the connections give genuine periodic orbits since some of them decompose to several shorter orbits ( called pseudo - orbits ; see @xcite ) .",
    "mller et al .",
    "@xcite used combinatorics to count the number of partner orbits and provided an approximation for the action difference , but a construction of partner orbits and an error bound of the approximation have not been derived . furthermore , it is necessary to arrive a mathematical definition for ` encounters ' , ` partner orbits ' , and to introduce the notions of ` beginning ' , ` end ' , and ` duration ' of an encounter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , after giving some background material , we introduce another version of poincar sections and a respective version of the anosov closing lemma . in the case that the space is compact , a poincar section with small radius can be identified with a square , so every point in a poincar section can be represented by a unique couple @xmath27 called _ unstable _ and _ stable coordinates_. in addition , we provide a ` connecting lemma ' to connect 2 orbits in a pseudo - orbit . in this way",
    ", one can construct a genuine periodic orbit close to a given pseudo - orbit . in section 3 , after providing mathematically rigorous definitions of ` encounters ' , ` partner orbits ' , ` orbit pairs ' , etc , we provide an inductive argument to construct partner orbits for a given orbit with a single @xmath0-parallel encounter .",
    "the first step of the inductive argument stated in theorem [ 3-encounter ] shows the existence of a unique partner orbit for a given orbit with a @xmath28-parallel encounter .",
    "the main result of the current paper is theorem [ thml ] which proves that there exist @xmath1 partner orbits for a given periodic orbit with an @xmath0-parallel encounter such that any two piercing points are not too close .",
    "this condition is expressed by differences of stable and unstable coordinates of the piercing points which guarantees that the encounter stretches are separated by non - vanishing loops and whence the partner orbits do not coincide .",
    "we use combinatorics to count the number of partner orbits and apply the connecting lemma , the anosov closing lemmas to construct partner orbits .",
    "the action difference between the orbit pairs can be approximated by terms of coordinates of the piercing points with a precisely estimated error .",

    "we consider the geodesic flow on compact riemann surfaces of constant negative curvature .",
    "in fact this flow has had a great historical relevance for the development of the whole theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems or anosov systems .",
    "it is well - known that any compact orientable surface with a metric of constant negative curvature is isometric to a factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hyperbolic plane endowed with the hyperbolic metric @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a discrete subgroup of the projective lie group @xmath33 ; here @xmath34 is the group of all real @xmath35 matrices with unity determinant , and @xmath36 denotes the unit matrix .",
    "the group @xmath37 acts transitively on @xmath38 by mbius transformations @xmath39 .",
    "if the action is free ( of fixed points ) , then the factor @xmath40 has a riemann surface structure .",
    "such a surface is a closed riemann surface of genus at least @xmath14 and has the hyperbolic plane @xmath38 as the universal covering .",
    "the geodesic flow @xmath41 on the unit tangent bundle @xmath42 goes along the unit speed geodesics on @xmath40 .",
    "this means that every orbit under the geodesic flow @xmath43 is a geodesic on @xmath44 which is the projection of a geodesic on @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , every oriented unit speed closed geodesic on @xmath40 is a periodic orbit of the geodesic flow @xmath43 on @xmath42 .",
    "on the other hand , the unit tangent bundle @xmath45 is isometric to the quotient space @xmath46 , which is the system of right co - sets of @xmath47 in @xmath37 , by an isometry @xmath48 .",
    "then the geodesic flow @xmath43 can be equivalently described as the natural ` quotient flow ' @xmath49 on @xmath50 associated to the flow @xmath51 on @xmath37 by the conjugate relation @xmath52 here @xmath53 denotes the equivalence class obtained from the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , there are one - to - one correspondences between the collection of all periodic orbits of @xmath55 ( denoted by @xmath56 ) , the collection of all oriented unit speed closed geodesics on @xmath57 ( denoted by @xmath58 ) , and the conjugacy classes in @xmath47 ( denoted by @xmath59 ) .",
    "the period @xmath18 of a periodic orbit in @xmath56 and the length @xmath60 of the corresponding closed geodesic in @xmath58 are related by @xmath61 , where @xmath8 is a representative of the respective conjugacy class in @xmath59 .",
    "there are some more advantages to work on @xmath50 rather than on @xmath42 .",
    "one can calculate explicitly the stable and unstable manifolds at a point @xmath62 to be @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the _ horocycle flow _ and _ conjugate horocycle flow _ defined by @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; here @xmath68 denote the equivalence classes obtained from @xmath69 .",
