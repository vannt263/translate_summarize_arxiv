    "the competition between the temperature and pairing correlations in hot nuclei has been studied for more than four decades .",
    "the first studies were based on the bcs approximation @xcite but later on more involved calculations based on the bogoliubov approach have been performed @xcite . more recently the bogoliubov approach has been employed together with self - consistent hartree - fock mean fields in order to study the pairing properties of hot nuclei .",
    "one of the first finite - temperature hfb ( ft - hfb ) calculations was based on a finite - range force of gogny type , which is used for describing both the mean field and the pairing properties of hot nuclei @xcite .",
    "ft - hfb calculations using zero - range forces have been done for hot nuclei @xcite and for the inner crust matter of neutron stars @xcite . in the latter case the mean field",
    "is obtained by using a skyrme force while the pairing correlations are calculated with a density - dependent delta interaction .",
    "also , shell - model approaches @xcite have been used in order to probe the impact of the temperature on both pairing and deformation degrees of freedom .",
    "the interplay between temperature and pairing correlations was also studied intensively in nuclear and neutron matter @xcite .",
    "typically , the pairing gaps are calculated in the bcs approximation and using single - particle states determined by self - consistent brueckner - hartree - fock or green s function methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in more fundamental approaches , which go beyond bcs approximation ,",
    "is still unclear how much the pairing correlations are affected by the medium dependence of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one open issue in current hfb calculations is how much the form of the pairing interaction affects the properties of nuclei , especially when one approaches the drip lines .",
    "it is also not clear yet if one really needs to introduce an explicit density dependence in the pairing interaction in order to enforce a pairing field evenly distributed in the nucleus ( `` volume type pairing '' ) or strongly localized in the surface region ( `` surface type pairing '' ) . since a realistic pairing force derived from first principles is missing , one hopes to disentangle between various types of pairing forces by analyzing their consequences on measurable quantities .",
    "however , up to now these studies are not conclusive .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a mixed surface - volume pairing interaction is considered to better explain the odd - even mass differences of some isotopic chains , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the surface or the volume type of the pairing interaction is found to be not so relevant for the neutron separation energies .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the pair density , which gives indications upon the localization of pair correlations in finite nuclei , is not strongly correlated to the surface or volume character of the pairing force but rather to the localization of the single - particle states close to the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "apart from the effects mentioned above , the type of the pairing force could also affect the vanishing of pairing correlations in hot nuclei .",
    "besides constant g studies there have not been such systematic studies with effective density - dependent pairing interactions .",
    "it is known that , in a simple bcs approach with a constant pairing g , the vanishing of pairing correlations is expected to occur at t@xmath0@xmath10.5 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze if the volume or surface character of the pairing force could significantly influence vanishing pairing correlations using density - dependent pairing interactions .",
    "it should be noted that experimentally , the critical temperature could be extracted from the change of the specific heat in the vanishing pairing correlations region , using level densities measurements , as shown in refs .",
    "in this work we employ the ft - hfb approach with zero - range forces .",
    "details can be found elsewhere @xcite , and we recall only the main equations .",
    "the ft - hfb equations , in coordinate representation , have the following form :    c (    cc h_t(r ) - & _ t ( r ) + _ t ( r ) & -h_t(r ) +    ) (    c u_i ( r ) + v_i ( r )    ) = e_i (    c u_i ( r ) + v_i ( r )    )  ,    [ 1 ] where @xmath3 is the quasiparticle energy , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the components of the radial ft - hfb wave function and @xmath6 is the chemical potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the thermal averaged mean field hamiltonian and @xmath8 is the thermal averaged pairing field .",
    "the latter is calculated with a density - dependent contact force of the following form @xcite :    v ( - ) = v_0 [ 1 - ( ) ^ ] ( - ) v_eff((r ) ) ( - ) , [ eqpaiint ] where @xmath9 is the baryonic density . with this force",
    "the thermal averaged pairing field is local and is given by :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the thermal averaged pairing tensor . due to the density dependence of the pairing force ,",
    "the thermal averaged mean field hamiltonian @xmath7 depends also on @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the averaged mean field hamiltonian depends on thermal averaged particle density , spin density and kinetic energy density .",
    "the thermal averaged particle density is given by :    _ t(r ) = _ i ( 2j_i+1 ) [ v_i^ * ( r ) v_i ( r ) ( 1 - f_i ) + + u_i^ * ( r ) u_i ( r ) f_i ] [ 2 ] where @xmath13^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature . for the expressions of other densities",
    "see ref.@xcite .    the ft - hfb equations ( [ 1 ] )",
    "are solved under a spherical symmetry assumption . the hartree - fock mean field",
    "is determined by using the skyrme force sly4 @xcite .",
    "for the pairing interaction we choose : @xmath15=0.16 @xmath16 and @xmath17=1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 controls the spatial localization of the pairing force .",
    "a volume pairing interaction corresponds to @xmath18=0 , whereas a surface type is given by @xmath18=1 .",
    "the pairing force is used with a quasiparticle energy cutoff equal to 60 mev and the calculations are performed in a box of radius r=18 fm .",
    "the study is performed for the case of sn isotopes . in what follows we present the results of the ft - hfb calculations , first in some stable isotopes and then for isotopes closer to the neutron - drip line .",
    "figure [ fig : pfield ] displays the pairing field obtained in @xmath19sn with surface and volume pairing interactions . in the volume pairing case ,",
    "the pairing field has similar values around the center and the surface , with a depression in the middle of the nucleus . with a surface pairing interaction ,",
    "the pairing field exhibits a large peak in the surface of the nucleus . to analyze how the pairing correlations are destroyed by the temperature one usually studies the temperature dependence of the pairing gap . since in the present calculations",
    "the gap is state dependent , one can use as order parameter the averaged gap .",
    "another choice is to use the pairing energy as order parameter .",
    "the two alternatives are compatible if the averaged gap is defined by :    @xmath20    figure [ fig : delta1 ] shows the thermal evolution of the mean neutron gap in @xmath19sn , in the case of a surface pairing interaction .",
    "the critical temperature above which pairing correlations vanish is t@xmath0=0.7 mev .",
    "it should be noted that the t@xmath0 @xmath10.5 @xmath2 rule is still qualitatively verified .    an alternative definition of the pairing gap is to use the particle density @xmath21 instead of the pairing density @xmath12 :    @xmath22    however , in this case a too large weight is put on states located deeply below the fermi level where pairing effects are small . such a mean pairing gap is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta1 ] .",
    "the value of the gap at t=0 is significantly smaller with @xmath23 than with @xmath24 .",
    "the volume averaged gap does not follow the bcs rule t@xmath0@xmath10.5 @xmath2 , and it is much closer to t@xmath0=@xmath2 .",
    "it shows that using the adequate definition @xmath24 of the mean pairing gap is necessary when predicting temperature effects related to pairing in nuclei .",
    "it should be noted that this deviation of @xmath23 from the standard t@xmath0@xmath10.5 @xmath2 rule is only observed for surface pairing . in the case of a volume pairing interaction , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are similar and are both compatible with the t@xmath0@xmath10.5 @xmath2 rule .    in order to compare the results obtained with volume or surface pairing forces , one needs to give a reasonable prescription for fixing the strength of the interaction . the best choice would be to get for both forces the same odd - even mass difference .",
    "the alternative we have taken here was to choose , in a given nuclei , the strength of the interactions such that to obtain the same total binding energy .",
    "table [ tabv0 ] summarizes the corresponding v@xmath25 values of eq .",
    "( [ eqpaiint ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : delta2 ] displays the pairing gaps in @xmath26sn calculated with a volume and a surface pairing interaction .",
    "they generally exhibit slightly different values at t=0 ( 10% deviation ) .",
    "these differences depend on the intensity of pairing correlations : v@xmath27 in @xmath19sn is somewhat smaller compared to other isotopes ( table [ tabv0 ] ) , whereas v@xmath28 does nt change very much from @xmath29sn to @xmath30sn .",
    "therefore the largest differences appear in @xmath29sn , where in average the pairing gaps are the largest .",
    "on the other hand , in @xmath19sn , in which the averaged pairing gap was reduced compared to the other isotopes , the volume and the surface pairing forces give practically the same energy gap at all temperatures . the interesting fact seen in figure [ fig : delta2 ]",
    "is that the two gaps converge towards similar critical temperatures even in the case when at t=0 the gaps are not the same .",
    "one can also notice that for both surface and volume pairing forces the rule t@xmath0@xmath1 0.5@xmath2 gets approximatively fulfilled .",
    "however , for all nuclei except @xmath19sn the pairing gap at t@xmath31 t@xmath0 is significantly larger in the case of the surface pairing interaction than in the volume one .",
    "it should be noted that this dependence on the nature of the pairing interaction requires that the pairing correlations at t=0 are large enough , which is the case of @xmath32sn . in the recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the pairing density depends on the angular momentum of the states close to the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , fig . [",
    "fig : delta2 ] shows that the critical temperature is not sensitive to this feature since the nuclei under consideration correspond to various energy positions of the fermi level in the n=50 - 82 shell .    in order to check the dependence of the critical temperature on the skyrme interaction ,",
    "ft - hfb calculations have been performed in @xmath33sn with the sgii interaction @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta3 ] ) .",
    "no deviation is found in the thermal evolution of the mean gap , compared to the above - mentioned results obtained with the sly4 interaction .",
    "this shows again the stability of the critical temperature . in this case",
    ", the surface pairing interaction gives also a larger averaged gap for t @xmath31 t@xmath0 .",
    "the average gap results from the contributions of various single quasiparticle states .",
    "one can have a more microscopic insight of vanishing pairing correlations by looking at the individual pairing gap values .",
    "[ fig : deltapart ] displays the evolution of the pairing gaps associated with the one quasiparticle levels of the neutron valence shell in @xmath29sn , using a surface pairing interaction .",
    "the various gap values at t=0 range from 1.3 mev to 1.8 mev .",
    "however , the behavior of the single quasiparticle gaps with respect to temperature are very similar : they all decrease so as to converge towards the same critical temperature t@xmath34 1 mev .",
    "hence the critical temperature itself is independent of the l - value of the single quasiparticle state .",
    "we have checked the validity of this result on other nuclei such as @xmath30sn .    in order to investigate more deeply the role of the individual states , fig .",
    "[ fig : equpart ] shows the evolution of the neutron single quasiparticle energies with respect to the temperature in @xmath29sn .",
    "the relative positions of the energy levels are given by their vicinity to the chemical potential : the states close to the chemical potential have low single quasiparticle energies , and are more sensitive to the pairing gap . on the contrary ,",
    "states located far from the chemical potential have larger quasiparticle energies and are less sensitive to the pairing gap evolution .",
    "one can see a general smooth decrease of the energies with increasing temperature , which is due to the decrease of the pairing gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deltapart ] ) . around the critical temperature ,",
    "only the lowest single quasiparticle states such as 2d@xmath35 also exhibit a strong decrease . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the single quasiparticle energies follow the smooth increase of the single particle energies , due to the absence of pairing correlations .",
    "this interpretation is also valid for other nuclei , such as @xmath30sn .",
    "the behavior of the vanishing of pairing correlations in exotic nuclei close to the drip - lines is an open question .",
    "we examine in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta3 ] the pairing gap of the very neutron - rich nucleus @xmath36sn .",
    "the results are obtained with the sly4 interaction and the surface pairing interaction is here adjusted to reproduce the t=0 gap value obtained with the volume type pairing .",
    "once again the critical temperature is predicted to be the same for both volume and surface pairing interactions : t@xmath0=0.8 mev .",
    "this result stresses again the strong stability of the critical temperature with respect to pairing localization properties , also in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "there is , however , a difference in the thermal evolution of the two mean gaps in @xmath36sn , as noticed in previous sn isotopes .",
    "for instance , at t=0.7 mev the gap is two times higher for a surface pairing interaction than for a volume one . hence pairing correlations at temperatures below t@xmath0 in neutron - rich as well as in stable nuclei",
    "may provide information about the surface or volume type of the pairing interaction .",
    "calculations have also been performed in ni isotopes , and the results are illustrated here for the case of the @xmath37ni nucleus .",
    "the t@xmath0@xmath1 0.5@xmath2 rule is still verified , both with surface and volume type interactions .",
    "the surface and the volume pairing interactions lead to similar critical temperatures , with 100 kev variation between the two cases .",
    "the situation is analogous in @xmath29sn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta2 ] ) where the surface and volume interactions give the largest variation in t@xmath0 , namely 100 kev .",
    "this upper limit shows that the absolute value of the critical temperature itself is rather independent of the nature of the pairing interaction .",
    "however , if measurements can reach such a resolution it would be of high interest to measure pairing properties at temperatures located just below t@xmath0 : for instance , in @xmath29sn at t=0.8 mev , the pairing gap is close to zero in the volume case whereas the gap remains @xmath38=1 mev in the surface case .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath37ni .",
    "[ fig : cv ] displays the specific heat for @xmath37ni , obtained in the ft - hfb calculations .",
    "due to the finite step in temperature used in the hfb calculations , the specific heat displays a kink at the critical temperature instead of the usual singularity .",
    "actually , due to the finite size of the nucleus , the specific heat should have a smooth @xmath39 shape behavior around the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "in order to get this behavior in the calculations , one needs to go beyond the hfb approach , e.g. , projecting out the number of particles and taking into account the thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the critical temperature for vanishing of pairing correlations in hot nuclei appears to be rather insensitive to the surface or volume localization of the pairing force used in ft - hfb calculations .",
    "for all the neutron - rich tin isotopes studied , we have found that the critical temperature is given approximatively by t@xmath0@xmath10.5 @xmath2 for both type of pairing forces and for stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "hence , the critical temperature could be deduced from the gap value at zero temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the pairing gap is strongly sensitive to the nature of the pairing interaction for temperatures just below the vanishing of pairing correlations , for the large majority of nuclei studied .",
    "this result should open an experimental investigation for the pairing interaction in nuclei .",
