    "the many attractive features of the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite or mssm have made it a leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "of course there is no direct evidence for susy .",
    "the current limits@xcite on susy masses from lep are close to its ultimate kinematic reach .",
    "lep will extend the limits on a higgs boson from the present @xmath2@xcite up to @xmath3@xcite .",
    "discovery of a light higgs would not prove the existence of susy but would be a strong hint : the light higgs boson must have a mass less than @xmath4 in the mssm and less than @xmath5 in a rather general class of susy models@xcite , while in the standard model it must be heavier than about @xmath4 if the theory holds up to a high scale@xcite .",
    "the next run of the tevatron will have a better chance to find susy particles ; the channel @xmath6 can be sensitive to masses up to @xmath7 for some choices of the other parameters@xcite .",
    "but the reach in this channel is quite model dependent .    the definitive search for weak - scale susy ,",
    "therefore , will have to await the lhc .",
    "the lhc with @xmath8 , 10% of its design luminosity per year , can detect gluinos and squarks up to about @xmath9 in the multi - jet plus missing transverse energy @xmath10 channels@xcite compared to an expected mass scale of less than @xmath11@xcite .",
    "it is difficult to reconstruct masses directly because every susy event contains two missing lightest susy particles @xmath12 .",
    "it is possible , however , to use endpoints of kinematic distributions to determine combinations of masses . in favorable cases",
    "these combinations can be used in a global fit to determine the model parameters .",
    "if susy is indeed the right answer , there should be a lot known about it before the next lepton collider  whether @xmath0 or @xmath1  is built .",
    "it is probably difficult to study the whole susy spectrum at the lhc , however , so an nlc is also expected to play an important role .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite ( mssm ) has for each standard model particle a partner differing in spin by @xmath13 . for each gauge boson",
    "there is a @xmath14 gaugino , and for each chiral fermion there is a scalar sfermion .",
    "two higgs doublets and their corresponding higgsinos are needed to give masses to all the quarks and to cancel anomalies .",
    "the susy particles have couplings determined by supersymmetry and are degenerate in mass with their standard model partners .",
    "there is at present no experimental evidence for susy .",
    "there is one possible experimental hint : the renormalization group equations imply that the @xmath15 gauge couplings measured at the @xmath16 mass meet in a way consistent with grand unification for the mssm with @xmath17 but not for the standard model.@xcite the unification is actually not quite perfect , but it is within the range that could be covered by gut threshold corrections .",
    "other possible hints have been widely discussed but have mostly been discredited .",
    "susy must of course be broken , since there is certainly no selectron degenerate with the electron .",
    "it is not possible to obtain an acceptable spectrum by breaking susy spontaneously using only the mssm fields .",
    "however , mass terms for gauginos , higgsinos , and sfermions do not break the @xmath15 gauge invariance of the mssm , so they can be added by hand without spoiling its renormalizability .",
    "there are also soft bilinear ( @xmath18 ) and trilinear ( @xmath19 ) couplings that are also gauge invariant and can be added . finally , it is necessary to add a susy - conserving higgsino mass ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that susy breaking occurs spontaneously in a `` hidden sector '' and is communicated to the mssm via some common interaction such as gravity . if susy is discovered , understanding the mechanism for its breaking will become an important issue in particle physics .",
    "after susy is broken , all the states with the same quantum numbers mix . the @xmath21 mix to give four neutralinos @xmath22 . the @xmath23 mix to give two charginos @xmath24 .",
    "the left and right squarks and sleptons also mix ; this mixing is proportional to the fermion mass and so is significant only for the third generation .",
    "the most general mssm allows baryon and lepton number violation , giving proton decay at the weak scale .",
    "the simplest solution is to impose invariance under a discrete symmetry @xmath25 note that @xmath26 for all standard model particles , and @xmath27 for all susy particles .",
    "thus @xmath28 parity invariance implies that susy particles are produced in pairs , that they decay to other susy particles , and that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable .",
    "cosmological constraints then require that the lsp be neutral and weakly interacting , so that it escapes from any detector .",
    "thus , the basic signature of ( @xmath28 parity conserving ) susy is missing transverse energy @xmath10 .",
    "the most general mssm has more than 100 parameters .",
    "many recent phenomenological studies have been based on a more restrictive model , the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model@xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the constrained mssm@xcite , although the latter adds some additional constraints . if susy breaking is communicated through gravity , then it is plausible that the susy breaking terms , like gravity , are universal at the gut scale .",
    "in particular , if all the scalar masses are identical , then electroweak symmetry must be unbroken .",
    "it turns out that the clebsch - gordon coefficients are such that when the parameters are run from the gut scale to the weak scale using the renormalization group equations , the large top yukawa coupling drives the mass - squared of the higgs negative , breaking electroweak symmetry but not color or charge .",
    "a example of this evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ masses ] .",
    "it is convenient to eliminate @xmath18 and @xmath29 in favor of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then the minimal sugra model is characterized by just four parameters and the sign of @xmath20 :    * @xmath32 : the common squark , slepton , and higgs mass at @xmath33 .",
    "* @xmath34 : the common gaugino mass at @xmath35 .",
    "* @xmath36 : the common trilinear coupling at @xmath35 .",
    "* @xmath37 : the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values at @xmath30 . * @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath36 is not very important for phenomenology at the weak scale .",
    "while the sugra model provides a much more tractable parameter space than the general mssm , one should remember that it is only one possible model .",
    "it is possible that the assumption of universal masses is not correct .",
    "it is also possible that susy breaking is communicated at a much lower mass scale , as in gauge mediated models@xcite .",
    "the lhc is a @xmath39 collider with an energy of @xmath40 , enough to produce @xmath41 and @xmath42 pairs with @xmath43 even with @xmath44 .",
    "these are typically produced with @xmath45 , so they move slowly in the lab frame and their decay products are widely separated .",
    "if @xmath28 parity is conserved , they will decay into the lsp @xmath12 plus multiple jets and perhaps multiple leptons .",
    "a typical decay chain might be : @xmath46 such decay chains produce many possible signatures combining jets , leptons , and @xmath10 from @xmath12 and @xmath47 s .",
    "for example , since the @xmath41 is self - conjugate , there are isolated same - sign dileptons @xmath48",
    ".    the @xmath49 discovery limits at the lhc for @xmath44 integrated luminosity are shown in figure  [ figrea ] .",
    "note that the reach is @xmath50 in the missing energy channels and @xmath51 in the multi - lepton channels .",
    "thus the lhc should find multiple signatures for susy with only @xmath44 if it exists at the weak scale .",
    "while it is easy to find signals for susy at lhc , there are two missing @xmath12 s in each event , making it difficult to reconstruct masses .",
    "however , it is possible@xcite to exploit the cascade decays characteristic of the mssm to determine combinations of masses .",
    "the strategy is to start at the bottom of the decay chain and work up , partially reconstruct specific final states and relating precision measurements of endpoints of kinematic distributions to combinations of masses .",
    "a global fit to these combinations can then be used to determine the model parameters , at least in favorable cases .",
    "it would be better to make the global fit not just to such endpoints but to all distributions , but this is more difficult technically and perhaps premature at this stage .",
    "what combinations of masses can be determined in this way depends on the decay modes and so requires study of specific susy models .",
    "the cern lhc program committee ( lhcc ) chose five sugra points for detailed study by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "the parameters of these points and some representative masses are listed in table  [ lhcc ] .",
    "point  3 is the `` comparison point , '' selected so that every existing or proposed accelerator can discover something . point  5 was chosen to give the right cold dark matter for cosmology and so is perhaps the most realistic .",
    "points  1 and 2 have gluino and squark masses of order @xmath11 .",
    "point  4 has the squarks much heavier than the gluinos .",
    "it is close to the boundary allowed by electroweak symmetry breaking ( at least with isajet  7.22 ) and so has a relatively small @xmath20 and a large mixing between gauginos and higgsinos . studying these specific points",
    "has proved surprisingly useful@xcite .",

    "gluinos and squarks are strongly produced at the lhc . but production cross sections fall rapidly with the produced mass , so it is important to find a variable that measures the produced mass for events with missing particles . a variable that works well for susy is the effective mass , defined as the sum of the missing energy and the @xmath59 s of the first four jets , @xmath60 samples of signal and standard model background events were generated with isajet@xcite . to separate susy from the standard model background ,",
    "events were selected with multiple jets plus missing energy :    * @xmath61 ; * @xmath62 jets with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; * transverse sphericity @xmath65 ; * no @xmath20 or isolated @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "the precision measurements of specific combinations of masses are based on the partial reconstruction of the corresponding final states . for each case ,",
    "susy and standard model background event samples were generated with isajet@xcite or pythia@xcite , a simple particle - level detector simulation incorporating resolutions characteristic of atlas and cms was made , and analysis cuts as described below were applied .",

    "point  3 has unusual branching ratios : @xmath75 the dominant decay of @xmath76 arises because the @xmath77 is lighter than the @xmath41 but the other squarks are heavier .",
    "events were selected to have two leptons and two @xmath78 jets :    * @xmath79 pair with @xmath80 , @xmath68 . * @xmath81 jets tagged as @xmath78 quarks with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . *",

    "most of the susy background comes from two @xmath84 decays and can be removed by plotting the distribution for @xmath85 this analysis clearly would have huge statistics and would be much easier than measuring @xmath86 at tevatron . given the current @xmath86 results",
    ", it seems conservative to estimate an error @xmath87 for @xmath8 .",

    "the @xmath104 mass was plotted for all pairs of @xmath78 jets with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "a correction factor was applied to the measured @xmath78 jet energies to account for neutrinos and energy loss out of the cone , and a 60% @xmath78-tagging efficiency was assumed . the resulting distribution ,",
    "figure  [ c5_mbb ] , has a peak at the higgs mass with a substantial susy background but very little standard model background .",
    "this signal is much easier than @xmath107 and would be the discovery mode for the higgs at this point .    the @xmath108 candidates can be used to reconstruct the decay chain @xmath109 to select these events exactly two additional jets with @xmath110 were required .",
    "then since one of the two @xmath111 combinations comes from the squark decay , the smaller of them must have an endpoint at a function of the squark mass and the other masses in the problem .",

    "gluinos dominate at point  4 since @xmath32 is large .",
    "this means that there is a lot of combinatorial background from the many jets in the final state .",
    "the strategy of this analysis@xcite is to use trilepton events to select the process @xmath122 then the dijet mass distributions for the right jet pairing have a common endpoint since @xmath123 .",

    "no @xmath10 cut was used . with these cuts",

    "the dijet mass distribution for the other pairings is shown in figure  [ fabiola16 ] .",
    "there is an endpoint at about the right point .",
    "the precision measurements described here are only a fraction of those in refs .  , , and .",
    "ideally one should combine these measurements with a large number of other ones and do a global fit , but this would require generating many signal signal event samples . instead a much simpler procedure has been adopted .",
    "sugra parameters were generated at random , the mass spectrum for each sugra point was calculated , and these were compared with the precision measurements and their estimated errors .",
    "two such fits have been made .",
    "fit  i@xcite uses only the measurements developed in ref .  .",
    "it assumes that the higgs mass can be related to the sugra parameters with an error @xmath135 , about the current theoretical error .",
    "it bases the statistical errors on @xmath8 .",
    "fit  ii@xcite adds some additional precision measurements developed after ref .  .",
    "it adds some other data , e.g. , from changing the squark masses at points  1 and 2 and seeing the effect of this on the mean @xmath59 of the hardest jet .",
    "this is not fully justified , but it is a plausible way of estimating the improvement from fitting some of the kinematic distributions as well as the precision measurements .",
    "the ultimate version of fit  ii also assumes a theoretical error on the higgs mass less than the expected experimental error from @xmath136 , @xmath137 and scales the statistical errors to @xmath138 .",
    "both fits scanned the sugra parameter space and determined the 68% confidence interval for each parameter .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ errors ] .",
    "no disconnected solutions were found . in particular ,",
    "@xmath139 was correctly determined , although this required including additional information in the fit in some cases .",
    "the gluino and squark masses are insensitive to @xmath32 at points  1 and 2 , and there is no information available on the slepton masses , accounting for the larger errors on @xmath32 at these points . finally , @xmath36 is poorly constrained in all cases , even for the ultimate version of fit  ii .",
    "it is possible to determine the weak scale parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 , but these are insensitive to @xmath36 .",
    "the five lhcc points do not exhaust the possibilities of even the minimal sugra model .",
    "for example , the @xmath143 is light for large @xmath31 , so @xmath142 decays can be dominant .",
    "consider the sugra point @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "then @xmath148 discovery of the susy signal is still straightforward , but none of the precision measurements discussed above are applicable .    one possible approach is to require two 3-prong hadronic @xmath142 s to maximize the visible @xmath149 mass and hence its sensitivity to the endpoint analogous to that discussed in section  vii.d .",
    "the difference of @xmath150 and @xmath151 is used to eliminate the contribution from two @xmath84 decays .",
    "the resulting distribution is shown in figure  [ c6_mtautaudif ] .",
    "there is clearly an endpoint visible from the contribution of @xmath152 plus a contribution from heavier gauginos .",
    "signatures like this require more study both for the tevatron and for the lhc .",
    "if susy exists at the electroweak scale , it should be straightforward to find signals for it at the lhc .",
    "it is possible in many cases to make precision measurements , and if the susy model is relatively simple , these can be used to determine its parameters .",
    "the lhc will mainly produce gluinos and squarks . in sugra",
    "these tend to decay mainly into the lighter gauginos ; the heavier ones are dominantly higgsino and so are suppressed both by their masses and by their couplings .",
    "the direct production of sleptons and sneutrinos is also very small , although they can be produced as decay products of the light gauginos if they are light enough . finally , the heavy higgs bosons have small production cross sections , and their dominant decay modes have large backgrounds .",
    "one should not underestimate the ingenuity of experimentalists with real data , but it seems likely that the lhc will not be able to study the entire susy spectrum .",
    "a next lepton collider with @xmath153 should be able to detect any susy particles except the @xmath12 that are kinematically accessible .",
    "sleptons probably represent the best opportunity to make significant progress beyond what has been learned from the lhc .",
    "one of the attractive features of the sugra model is that the @xmath12 is a good dark matter candidate , and the abundance of cold dark matter favors light sleptons@xcite .",
    "a lepton collider provides an important additional constraint that the slepton pairs are produced with known energy , and this allows precise measurements to be made@xcite .",
    "but if more than one slepton is being produced , the spectrum can be quite complex , so high luminosity ( as well as enough energy ) may be essential .",
