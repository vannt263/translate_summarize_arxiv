    "the fabre ( ( tmttf)@xmath0x ) and bechgaard ( ( tmtsf)@xmath0x ) series of charge transfer salts show a very rich sequence of competing ground states when either hydrostatic or chemical pressure is applied @xcite . in the universal phase diagram of these series ,",
    "the ( tmttf)@xmath0x are mott insulators that develop a charge ordered ( co ) state @xcite .",
    "this state is followed at lower temperature by either an antiferromagnetic nel or a lattice distorted spin - peierls ( sp ) phase .",
    "this pattern turns out to be affected by pressure , anion x substitution , and to some degree by deuteration of the methyl groups .",
    "this is how the ( tmttf)@xmath0x can be moved along the pressure axis with respect to the ( tmtsf)@xmath0x series for which metallic , antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases can be stabilized . in low pressure conditions , the quasi - one - dimensional ( tmttf)@xmath0x salts thus appear as model correlated systems to study the interplay between spin , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom .    in several ( tmttf)@xmath0x salts with octahedral anions x , the co transition follows and in some cases coincides with  the 4__@xmath2 _ _ charge localization @xcite .",
    "the first evidences of this transition in x= sbf@xmath1 and asf@xmath1 came from transport measurements @xcite .",
    "the transition was dubbed `` structureless '' , because of the absence of any structural modification associated to it @xcite .",
    "the co character of the transition only comes much later from the low frequency dielectric response  @xcite , and nmr experiments in which charge disproportionation in the unit cell was unveiled @xcite .",
    "the co character of the transition is also found from infrared spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the co transition is also accompanied by the onset of a ferroelectric state revealed by the divergence of the low frequency dielectric constant @xcite .    as regards to spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "these are essentially decoupled from the progressive charge localization or the co transition . however , in compounds like x= pf@xmath1 in normal pressure conditions , a sp transition takes place at @xmath3  k ( hydrogenated ) @xcite and 13 k ( deuterated ) @xcite .",
    "the spin singlet state that goes with the sp lattice distortion has been borne out by spin susceptibility @xcite , and nmr spin relaxation rate @xcite , whereas the magnetic field - temperature phase diagram for the pf@xmath1 salt has been obtained by nmr and high - field magnetization studies @xcite . in the pf@xmath1 salt , the observation of x - ray 2__@xmath2 _ _ diffuse scattering indicates the presence of lattice precursors of the sp transition below 60  k @xcite ; these open a spin pseudo gap @xcite , as exhibited by magnetic suceptibility and nmr data @xcite .",
    "finally , lattice expansion effects were recently observed at both co and sp transitions of the pf@xmath1 and asf@xmath1 salts @xcite .",
    "indeed , distinct lattice effects were found at @xmath4 in the uniaxial expansivity along the interstack @xmath5 direction , signaling an active role of anion x lattice degrees of freedom in the stabilization of the co ground state , and further clarifying the ferroelectric nature of the transition .",
    "it is also the @xmath5-axis expansivity that is the most strongly affected at the sp transition .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of interplay between charge , spin and lattice degrees of freedom by studying the 16.5 ghz complex microwave dielectric function of ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 single crystals under magnetic field .",
    "dielectric anomalies are observed at both the co and sp transitions .",
    "the increase of the @xmath4 scale and the drop of @xmath6 are also confirmed for the deuterated compound as a negative shift on the pressure scale .",
    "up to 18 tesla , the sp transition temperature varies quadratically with field , in fair agreement with the mean - field prediction obtained by cross @xcite .",
    "other magnetic fields effects on the polarizability of the system are found and ascribed to the interaction between co and sp orderings .",
    "finally , we report the existence of thermal relaxation effects in the deuterated compound near the sp transition .",
    "hydrogenated ( h ) ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 single crystals were grown from thf using the standard constant - current ( low current density ) electrochemical procedure .",

    "@xcite for the preparation of 3-chloro-2-butanone - d@xmath8 .",
    "however , this awkward very poorly described procedure led in our hands to traces , if any , of the desired chloroketone .",
    "therefore , we worked out a more practical and shortened procedure to prepare this compound : perdeuterioacetoin was first prepared from perdeuteriobiacetyl @xcite according to the literature @xcite and the procedure for the conversion of allylic alcohols into chlorides @xcite applied to this -hydroxy ketone . to the cooled mixture of the latter with a slight excess of pph@xmath9 in sulfolane was added dropwise a solution of hexachloroacetone in sulfolane , and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for two weeks ; a flash distillation of the reaction mixture and a subsequent distillation at atmospheric pressure led to the desired chloroketone with a ( up to ) 50% yield . starting from this deuterated chloroketone ,",
    "tmttf-@xmath7 was obtained using usual procedures and the corresponding deuterium incorporation - levels estimated by nmr to be 97.5 % .",
    "the crystals have the shape of a needle oriented along the chain axis @xmath10 , from which were cut short slabs of typical dimensions 2.4x0.8x0.4 mm@xmath11 for h and 1.5x0.4x0.07 mm@xmath11 for d. we used a standard microwave cavity perturbation technique @xcite to measure the complex dielectric function @xmath12 along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "a copper cavity resonating in the te@xmath13 mode was used at 16.5 ghz .",
    "the organic slab is inserted in a mylar envelope and immobilized by thin cotton threads to prevent any stress or movement during thermal cycling .",

    "when the temperature is decreased from 300 k , the dielectric function of both h and d salts shows a similar behavior : the real part @xmath17 decreases smoothly with a faster rate below 100 k before its saturation at low temperatures ; the imaginary part @xmath18 rather increases first , reaches a maximum below 100 k and decreases rapidly toward zero at low @xmath19 .",
    "these temperature profiles are presented below 120 k in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the features observed below 100 k are sharper for the d compound and they are attributed to a well - defined co transition at @xmath4 = 84 k as it is clearly identified for both parts of the complex @xmath20 ; this value of @xmath4 is identical to the one deduced from esr measurements @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 is more difficult for the h salt , because of the diffusive character of the transition identified of the relaxor type @xcite . by looking at the temperature derivative of both parts of the dielectric function ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , top panel ) , we deduce the value @xmath4 @xmath21 63 k , in agreement with previous works @xcite .",
    "contrary to previous dielectric measurements on the same compound @xcite , however , our microwave data clearly show anomalies in the low temperature range at @xmath6 , which will be analyzed later in the paper .     obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq.1].,width=321 ]    earlier analysis of the dielectric response measurements performed at lower frequencies ( 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath22 hz ) @xcite , showed that the @xmath23 data can be qualitatively understood by assuming the existence of critical slowing down near a phase transition .",
    "the maximum of @xmath24 was used to obtain an effective temperature dependent relaxation time @xmath25 . in a similar way",
    ", we propose to model the frequency dependence of the dielectric function by using a monodispersive debye relaxation term to get the temperature dependence of the relaxation time at a single frequency @xmath26 from the ratio @xmath27}\\label{eq.1}\\ ] ] the temperature profile @xmath25 deduced from eq .",
    "[ eq.1 ] is not very sensitive to the exact value chosen for the high frequency dielectric constant @xmath28 , which was fixed to 2.5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 curves deduced for both salts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] on a log - log scale .",
    "these relaxation time curves are quite different from the data collected at lower frequencies @xcite : not only are the absolute values smaller by 4 orders of magnitude at 100 k , but the temperature variation is the opposite below the co transition .",
    "indeed , for the h salt , although @xmath25 increases below 120 k , it presents a maximum around 80 k and decreases rapidly by more than one order of magnitude down to 40 k. below , @xmath25 keeps decreasing , but with a different slope . between 80 k and",
    "the lowest temperature reached at 2 k , @xmath25 , has practically decreased by 3 orders of magnitude , while the low frequency data rather show an increase of the same size with only a change of slope near @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a kink is observed at @xmath6 followed by a small variation of the decreasing rate . if one looks at the relaxation time for the d salt in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , it shows a similar behavior from 120 to 40 k , but the maximum in @xmath25 , which is sharper , occurs just below @xmath4 . for @xmath29 40 k ,",
    "the decrease is less pronounced than for the h salt due to an additional contribution to the dielectric function , and which will be discussed in more detail below .     for the h salt in 0 ( red ) , 12 ( blue ) and 18 ( green ) tesla .",
    "the black line is the @xmath30 + @xmath31 fit.,width=321 ]    the discrepancy between microwave and low frequency data for the h salt may be linked to the nature of the relaxor ferroelectric state and to the four orders of magnitude difference in frequency .",
    "the microwave experiment is likely to be sensitive to the spatial variation of polar order taking place at relatively short length scale , which is characterized by a short relaxation time .",
    "as we move further below @xmath4 on the temperature axis , these polar fluctuations decrease in size yielding a decrease of the dielectric constant and of the corresponding losses , as depicted in figures  [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.3 ] .",
    "as regards to the increase of @xmath4 by deuteration , it has been shown recently that the collective displacement of counteranions x@xmath32 is directly coupled to the charge modulation along the stacks @xcite and that the stabilizing potential grows not only with the size of the anion but also upon deuteration @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 revealed by the microwave experiment on a deuterated crystal is consistent with this picture .",
    "( @xmath33 ) in the critical region of the sp transition.,width=321 ]    let us examine now the anomalies appearing in the sp state .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] the dielectric function of the h salt below 30 k. in zero magnetic field , the real part @xmath17 increases abruptly below 16.5 @xmath34 0.1 k and then decreases slightly as we move sufficiently down in temperature . to",
    "the increase in @xmath17 corresponds a peak in the imaginary part @xmath18 .",
    "the latter decreases to zero with a larger slope .",
    "these anomalies are consistent with the onset of the sp long - range order at @xmath35k @xcite .",
    "this is also compatible with the application of a magnetic field , which depresses @xmath6 down to 12.5 k@xmath34 0.2 at 18 tesla . except for a small temperature interval where critical sp fluctuations enhance the dielectric constant",
    ", the magnetic field has no noticeable effect above @xmath6 , where @xmath17 follows a perfect @xmath36 power law up to 30 k , as indicated by the black line extrapolated toward the very low temperature domain ( top panel ) .",
    "the microwave absorption is very low in this temperature range and this yields larger imprecisions on @xmath24 when the field is applied .",
    "nevertheless , we found a @xmath37 power law with @xmath38 lying in the 1.4 - 1.6 interval for @xmath39 .",
    "we have substracted these power laws extrapolated to zero to obtain the contribution of the sp state to the dielectric function at low temperatures , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] .",
    "the anomaly shown by @xmath40 as we dip into the sp ordered region reveals an increase of polarizability in the presence of the lattice distortion .",
    "this is compatible with a reduction of the amplitude of the co order parameter as the sp order sets in , an effect also consistent with previous nmr and optical measurements on the cousin sp compound ( tmttf)@xmath0asf@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the amplitude of the variation shown by @xmath42 , as a result of sp ordering , is at the most 1% of the background value exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "while the anomaly indicates that the lattice distortion does alter the charge ordered state of ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , the relative smallness of the effect may explain the difficulty for charge sensitive probes to detect any reduction of co ordering by the sp state in this material @xcite .",
    "the rapid increase of the dielectric response below @xmath43 suggests a temperature dependence of @xmath40 governed by the criticality of the sp order parameter .",
    "a log - log plot analysis of the @xmath40 data reveals indeed that the critical behavior can be reasonably fitted with a power law @xmath44 . using the value @xmath6 obtained from the maximum slope of @xmath45 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath46 is extracted ( dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "this non mean field value is consistent with the @xmath47 expected for a sp ",
    "one - component  order parameter in three dimensions .",
    "considering now the magnetic field dependence , @xmath6 is found to be progressively depressed under field .",
    "the transition s width increases due to a larger temperature interval of sp critical fluctuations .",
    "however , at variance with other spin - peierls systems like cugeo@xmath9 @xcite , or peierls systems @xcite , for which the order parameter is independent of magnetic field in the low temperature limit @xcite , @xmath48 is here field dependent .",
    "the fact that for ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , the sp lattice distortion occurs in the co  ferroelectric  state may be responsible for the slight increase of the low temperature polarizability in the presence of a field . as lattice effects",
    "are involved in both transitions , it appears difficult , however , to predict how both types of order interact and are modified by a magnetic field .",
    "for the d salt : 2 hours ( red ) and 24 hours ( blue ) waiting time at 3 k. inset : time dependence of @xmath40 at 3 k.,width=321 ]    as reported in neutron experiments @xcite , we also observe a reduction of the sp transition temperature upon deuteration .",
    "however , thermal relaxation effects are observed at microwave frequencies at low temperatures for the d salt . by deuteration",
    "the decrease of internal pressure increases the volume of the anion cavity delimited by the methyl groups .",
    "these deuterated groups can thus move more freely and are probably the cause of the anomalous relaxation effects .",
    "the dielectric function of this salt is shown below 30 k in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of both parts of @xmath20 is quite different from the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] for the h salt .",
    "although we can identify features related to the sp transition , that is a sudden slope variation on @xmath17 and a sharp peak on @xmath18 at 13.1 k , there is clearly another mechanism contributing to the dielectric function in this temperature range .",
    "this contribution is critically dependent on time as evidenced by the two curves appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , taken respectively 2 and 24 hours after the first cooling down to 2 k. in the inset , we present the time dependence of @xmath40 at @xmath19 = 3 k , just after cooling the sample from 40 k. two time scales are clearly observed ( insert of fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] ) : a relatively fast one during the first half - hour and a very slow one for which saturation is obtained approximately after 48 hours .",
    "similar effects with decreasing amplitude are observed up to 40 k. these thermal relaxation effects related to deuterated methyl groups prevent any analysis of the sp contribution to the dielectric function similar to the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] for the hydrogenated samples .",
    "these effects also mask the real temperature dependence of the relaxation @xmath25 below 40 k in the co state ( fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , our microwave data confirm the decrease of @xmath49 by roughly 30% upon deuteration @xcite and its magnetic field dependence @xmath50 could be studied up to 18 tesla and compared with the hydrogenated salt .     for the(tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 salts : red triangles for h , blue squares for d ; the continuous and dash lines are the respective fits to eq .",
    "[ eq.2].,width=321 ]    the magnetic field dependence of the sp transition temperature is known to fit a quadratic variation @xcite in relatively low fields as predicted theoretically @xcite . in the hydrogenated ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 salt ,",
