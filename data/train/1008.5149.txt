    "elliptical galaxies were considered for many years to be inert systems , devoid of interstellar matter .",
    "the study of absorbing material in early - type galaxies gained interest with the identification of a class of galaxies characterized by an elliptical - like stellar body crossed by dark lanes or showing dark patches ( bertola & galletta 1978 ; bertola 1987 ) .",
    "these are believed to be light extinguishing dust clouds .",
    "much of our knowledge of the dust grain properties is derived from the analysis of the attenuation of starlight by the absorption and scattering of light by grains in dusty structures . in particular , deriving the normalized amount of extinction as a function of wavelength , also known as the extinction law , is a useful tool to study the dust grain size and chemical composition .",
    "the extinction law in the milky way ( mw ) is usually studied by observing stars with similar spectral type and luminosity class but with different foreground extinction ( savage & mathis 1979 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "since this method requires individual stars to be resolved , different methods must be invoked to study the extinction law even in nearby galaxies . in galaxies where the underlying light distribution across the stellar body varies smoothly , namely ellipticals and lenticulars , dust lanes and patches",
    "appear as local disturbances of the global brightness pattern .",
    "masking the dusty regions allows the extraction of a dust - free model of the original underlying galaxy and the derivation of extinction at these regions .",
    "a significant number of e / s0 galaxies have been investigated with this method ( see goudfrooij et al .  1994 ; patil et al .  2007 ;",
    "finkelman et al .",
    "2008 ; finkelman et al .",
    "the overall result from these studies is that the extragalactic dust is amazingly similar to the dust in the mw , at least in the optical part of the spectrum .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is that dust grains in different objects seem to have similar sizes and chemical composition .",
    "such a similarity may have implications on the physical conditions and/or the origin of the dust at least for this class of galaxies .",
    "this paper is the second in our on - going program to observe dark - lane e / s0 galaxies with the southern african large telescope ( salt ; buckley , swart & meiring 2006 ) and its ccd camera ( salticam , odonoghue et al .",
    "we present our analysis of seven dust - lane e / s0 galaxies , adding to the nine objects recently studied by finkelman et al .",
    "observing nearby dust - lane e / s0 with an ( effectively ) nine - meter telescope has the specific advantage of achieving reasonable sensitivity even at the shortest spectral band used , despite the atmospheric extinction .",
    "the extention of the optical study of the extinction law towards shorter wavelength allows the extraction of more information about the extragalactic extinction law close to the blue atmospheric cutoff where differences among extinction curves are better detected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : ",
    "[ s : obs_and_red ] gives a description of all the observations and data reduction ; we present and analyze our results in ",
    "[ s : analysis ] , discuss them in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] , and summarize our conclusions in   [ s : summ ] .",
    "ccd imaging observations of 12 dust - lane e / s0 galaxies were performed in service mode from february to may 2009 with salt during its performance verification ( pv ) phase .",
    "the observations were performed using the johnson - cousins b , v , r & i filters , as well as two short - wavelength interference filters , u1 and u2 , with transmission bands peaking at 340 nm ( fwhm 35 nm ) and 380 nm ( fwhm 40 nm ) respectively .",
    "the salticam is a ccd mosaic of two 2048x4102 pixel ccds .",
    "the full salticam image is about 9.6 by 9.6 with pixels of @xmath50\".28 ( after on - chip binning by a factor of two ) , but the nominal science field is eight arcmin .    the sample galaxies are listed in table [ t : obs ] with their coordinates , morphological classification and optical size taken from the rc3 catalog ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1992 ) or from hyperleda ( paturel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the objects were selected from catalogs of objects with dust lanes ( hawarden et al .",
    "1981 ; ebneter & balick 1985 ; bertola 1987 ) and were chosen according to visibility conditions and availability of observing nights , and not as part of a complete sample .",
    "the observations consisted of short - duration integrations while the filter wheel cycled between the six filters , resulting in six images per cycle .",
    "typical exposure times were 200 sec for the u1 & u2 bands , 30 sec for the b & v bands , and 15 sec for the r & i bands .",
    "they were determined to be sufficiently short to prevent image trailing when operating in the salticam unguided mode ( but with salt tracking ) or overexposure of the brightest part of each galaxy . due to the limited image quality of the telescope during the pv phase the workable field",
    "was limited to about four arcmin .",
    "the area nevertheless was sufficient to obtain minimally overlapping multiple dithered images of the galaxies in the central regions of both ccds .",
    "we created a sky flat - field from the set of exposures in each field for each filter by median - combining the scaled images without correcting for dithering .",
    "we then corrected the images for flat - field and created a count - frequency histogram for each galaxy surroundings .",
    "we fitted a gaussian distribution curve to the peak of the histogram , where the most frequent count value was assumed to represent the sky background .",
    "the images where the histogram significantly deviated from a gaussian shape were rejected from the analysis .",
    "the reduced images were geometrically aligned by measuring centroids of several common stars in the galaxy frames and were then background - subtracted and combined to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "this alignment procedure involved iraf tasks for translation and rotation of the images , so that a small amount of blurring was introduced , affecting the positional accuracy to a few hundredths of a pixel .",
    "while @xmath6 exposures were obtained for each galaxy in each filter , we selected only the images with the best image quality , and with seeing below @xmath7 .",
    "the final set of images for each filter therefore included only @xmath8 images .",
    "since the psf shape of the stars in each image is often slightly distorted , we did not attempt to convolve the images to the same fwhm before combining the images .",
    "this has no consequence for the results since the spatial scale of features we measure is determined by the image with the worst psf size .",
    "the combined r - band contour map and b - r colour - index map for each galaxy are presented in figures [ f : rmaps ] and [ f : brmaps ] , respectively .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "however , tracing the possible variations of the dust column density and geometry within the dust lane in a certain galaxy requires better spatial resolution than provided by salticam . with no available high - resolution optical data of our sample galaxies , we used archival hst / wfpc2 data of ngc2685 , a representative e / s0 galaxy with well - defined dust lanes , to test the finkelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) hypothesis . in particular , we investigated the presence of highly obscured regions through the search of greyish extinction .",
    "our analysis shows that the dust lanes do not show transparent `` holes '' or opaque `` bricks '' , but are rather smooth structures down to scales as small as @xmath9 pc .",
    "figure [ f : extval ] further demonstrates the foreground screen model validity for the case of our galaxies .    the dust structure in ngc2685",
    "is characterized by a fragmented and filamentary geometry .",
    "the complexity of structures of interstellar clouds are often studied and characterized by fractal analysis ( see khalil et al .",
    "2006 ; snchez & alfaro 2008 and references therein ) . the limited resolution , finite - size effects and use of different analysis algorithms are known to introduce biases on the estimate of the fractal dimension . using the box - counting technique",
    ", previous studies of molecular and dust clouds found that the fractal dimension value is almost always between 1.2 and 1.5 .",
    "although a significant part of fractal analysis studies is dedicated to the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxy ( e.g. , khalil et al .",
    "2006 ) , a growing number of studies also focus on the hi ( e.g. , westpfaul et al .",
    "1999 ) , hii ( e.g. , snchez & alfaro 2008 ) and the dust component ( e.g. , keel & white 2001 ; elmegreen , elmegreen & leitner 2003 ) in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , the general result of a more or less constant fractal dimension might reflect a universal value that is related with the underlying physical processes that drive the growth and subsequent evolution of the interstellar clouds ( e.g. , elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; elmegreen 1997 ; combes 2000 ; chappell & scalo 2001 ) . the similarity in fractal structure of both dust and molecular clouds also support an hypothesis that the dust is related with the process of molecule formation in cold clouds ( datta 2004 ) .",
    "examining the extinction map of ngc2685 we find the contours at constant extinction to be individually scale - free for sampling lengths @xmath10 pixels ( @xmath11 pc ) .",
    "we measured for ngc2685 a box - counting dimension between 1.1 and 1.2 , which is only marginally consistent with the fractal dimension measured for the ism in previous studies , and is closer to the fractal dimension of linear and euclidean structures .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether the fractal behavior of ism in dust - lane e / s0 galaxies follows the universal structural evolution of ism observed in the mw and nearby spiral galaxies or otherwise indicates a different evolution . determining this with confidence requires measuring with hst the fractal dimension of the dust structures in a larger sample of dust - lane e / s0s .",
    "the dust mass for each sample galaxy was evaluated independently in two ways , based on the optical extinction or from far - ir observations .",
    "the estimated masses lie in the range @xmath12 to @xmath2 , in good agreement with previous estimates for early - type galaxies with dark lanes ( see finkelman et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) . since we could not measure the entire dusty region with the optical method , and",
    "since we assumed that the dust does not intermix with the stars within the galaxy , this method provides only a lower limit to the true dust content of the host galaxies that should be confirmed by other methods . using iras flux densities to trace the dust",
    "far - ir emission reveals that the dust masses are up to an order of magnitude higher than measured from the optical extinction , implying the presence of a more massive diffuse dust component ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; patil et al .  2007 ;",
    "finkelman et al .",
    "this is the second paper presenting new results from an on - going program to study the extragalactic extinction law with salt down to the ultraviolet atmospheric cutoff ( see finkelman et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we derived the ratio between the total v band extinction and the selective b and v extinction @xmath13 for seven out of our 12 sample galaxies , and obtained an avergage of @xmath14 , slightly smaller than that found by finkelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and than the galactic value but similar within the error bars .",
    "extinction curves derived for the sample galaxies run parallel to the canonical galactic curve but do not necessarily overlap .",
    "we found that deviations from the standard galactic value are unlikely to be affected by the image resolution and scales of the dust distribution , and that the effect of intermix of stars and dust , which needs to be considered when measuring the extinction in highly - inclined disk galaxies , is negligible for the case of dust lanes in e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that dust in the extragalactic environment has similar properties to the galactic grains , and that any deviation of extinction value from the galactic one can be accounted for by a variation of the characteristic grain size responsible for the optical extinction .",
    "the dust content in the dust lanes derived by the optical extinction method for the sample galaxies is in the range @xmath12 to @xmath2 , whereas the diffuse dust content might be larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "these results are fully in agreement with those of finkelman et al .",
