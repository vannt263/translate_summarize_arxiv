    "the investigation of ordered double perovskite materials @xmath12 with @xmath3 an alkaline earth such as sr , ba , or ca and @xmath13 two different transition metals has been strongly stimulated by the discovery of a large room temperature magnetoresistive effect at low magnetic fields in sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the double perovskites seem to be ferromagnetic metals with high curie temperatures @xmath4 of up to 635k @xcite and apparently have highly spin polarized conduction band makes these materials interesting for applications in spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions or low - field magnetoresistive sensors @xcite . however , the double perovskites are also of fundamental interest since both their basic physics and materials aspects are not well understood .",
    "it is evident that intensive research has been dedicated to both the variation of the metallic / magnetic ions on the @xmath14- and @xmath15-site as well as electron doping studies , where the divalent alkaline earth ions on the @xmath3-site are partially replaced by a trivalent rare earth ion such as la , in order to understand the electronic structure and the magnetic exchange in the double perovskites in detail .",
    "furthermore , these studies aimed for the tailoring and optimization of the magnetic properties of the double perovskites for their use in magnetoelectronic devices such as spin valves , magnetic information storage systems , or as sources for spin polarized electrons in spintronics . here , important aspects are the achievement of sufficiently high values for @xmath4 and the spin polarization to allow for the operation of potential devices at room temperature . along this line ,",
    "in the compound sr@xmath6crreo@xmath1 a curie temperature of @xmath16k has been obtained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 an increase in @xmath4 of about 70k has been reported as a result of electron doping by partial substitution of divalent sr@xmath9 by trivalent la@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "with respect to magnetoresistance , up to now large low - field magnetoresistive effects have been found not only in sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1@xcite , but also in many other double perovskites as for example sr@xmath6fereo@xmath1 @xcite , sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 @xcite , and ( ba@xmath17sr@xmath18)@xmath19la@xmath20femoo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the origin of magnetism in the double perovskite still is discussed controversially . historically , the ferrimagnetism in the system sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 has been explained in terms of an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the mo@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) spin and the fe@xmath10 ( @xmath23 ) spins @xcite .",
    "however , more recently moritomo _ et al .",
    "_ found a strong correlation between the room temperature conductivity and the curie temperature , implying that the mobile conduction electrons mediate the exchange interaction between the local fe@xmath10 spins @xcite .",
    "therefore , in analogy to the doped manganites it was tempting to explain the ferromagnetic coupling between the fe sites based on a double exchange mechanism , where the delocalized electron provided by the mo  @xmath24 configuration plays the role of the delocalized @xmath25 electron in the manganites .",
    "however , as pointed out by sarma  @xcite there are important differences between the manganites and the double perovskites . in the former , both",
    "the localized mn  @xmath26 electrons and the delocalized mn  @xmath25 electron reside at the same site and their spins are coupled ferromagnetically by a strong on - site hund s coupling . in the latter , the localized fe  @xmath27 electrons ( fe@xmath10 : @xmath28 ) and the delocalized mo  @xmath29 electron ( mo@xmath21 : @xmath30 ) nominally are at two different sites although the mo  @xmath29 electron obtains a finite fe character by sizable hopping interaction . at first glance",
    "this seems to support a double exchange szenario .",
    "however , in sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 according to band structure calculations the fe  @xmath27 spin - up band is completely full making it impossible for another spin - up electron to hop between fe sites and thus forcing the delocalized electrons to be spin - down electrons .",
    "therefore , the hund s coupling strength , which provides the energy scale for the on - site spin coupling in the double exchange mechanism for the manganites , can not be invoked for sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 .",
    "this demonstrates that in the double perovskites the antiferromagnetic coupling between the localized and the delocalized electrons , which according to the large @xmath4 is strong , must originate from another mechanism .",
    "such mechanism has been proposed by sarma  @xcite for sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 and extended to many other systems by kanamori and terakura  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the hybridization of the mo  @xmath29 ( @xmath26 ) and fe @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) states plays the key role in stabilizing ferromagnetism at high curie temperatures @xcite .",
    "if the fe@xmath10 spins are ferromagnetically ordered , the hybridization between the fe  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) and the mo  @xmath29 ( @xmath26 ) states pushes up and down the mo  @xmath31 and mo  @xmath32 states , respectively . the essential point in this scenario , which is discussed in more detail below ,",
    "is that the hybridized states are located energetically between the exchange - split fe  @xmath33 and the fe  @xmath34 levels .",
    "we note that in this model the magnetic moment at the mo site is merely induced by the fe magnetic moments through the hybridization between the fe  @xmath27 and the mo  @xmath29 states what can be considered as a magnetic proximity effect . in this sense",
    "the double perovskites should be denoted ferromagnetic and not ferrimagnetic  @xcite .    despite the recent progress in understanding the physics of the double perovskites",
    "there is still an open debate on the adequate theoretical modelling .",
    "in particular , the details of the interplay between structural , electronic , and magnetic degrees of freedom in the double perovskites is not yet clearly understood .",
    "recently , the @xmath4 in double perovskites was discussed to depend sensitively on the band structure and band filling in contrast to experimental results @xcite . however , since in experiments often changes in the number of conduction electrons achieved by partially replacing the divalent alkaline earth ions on the @xmath3- and @xmath35-site by trivalent rare earth ions are accompanied by significant steric effects , it is difficult to distinguish between doping and structural effects",
    ". it is therefore desirable to investigate both the influence of structural changes ( changes in the bond length and bond angles ) and the effect of carrier doping .    here",
    ", we present a study of the effect of structural changes and doping in the double perovskite @xmath0crwo@xmath1 ( @xmath36 ) on the magnetotransport , the magnetic and optical properties together with band structure calculations .",
    "we note that a major difference between the system @xmath0crwo@xmath1 and the systems @xmath0femoo@xmath1 or @xmath0fereo@xmath1 is the fact that in the former the majority spin band is only partially filled ( cr@xmath10 , @xmath37 , only the cr  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) levels are occupied ) , whereas in the latter the majority spin band is completely filled ( fe@xmath10 , @xmath28 , both the fe  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) and fe  @xmath27 ( @xmath38 ) levels are occupied ) .",
    "we discuss that despite this difference the magnetism in @xmath0crwo@xmath1 and @xmath0femoo@xmath1 is similar . for both systems",
    "the exchange gap is important for the magnetic exchange and half metallicity .",
    "however , whereas for the former system also the crystal field gap between the @xmath26 and the @xmath25 levels plays a key role , for the latter the crystal field gap is irrelevant .",
    "a key result of our study is that optimum magnetic properties such as half metallicity and high @xmath4 can only be obtained in the undoped compounds close to the ideal undistorted perovskite structure that is characterized by a tolerance factor @xmath39 of the perovskite unit cell .",
    "furthermore , we find that electron doping tends to decrease @xmath4 in @xmath0crwo@xmath1 .",
    "in our study , we have used both polycrystalline and epitaxial thin film samples .",
    "polycrystalline samples were prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of srco@xmath40 , baco@xmath40 , caco@xmath40 , cr@xmath6o@xmath40 , la@xmath6o@xmath40 , and wo@xmath40 with a purity ranging between 99.99% and 99.999% .",
    "these powders were thoroughly mixed , placed in al@xmath6o@xmath40 crucibles , and then repeatedly heated in a thermobalance under reducing atmosphere ( h@xmath6/ar : 5%/95% ) with intermediate grinding .",
    "the final sintering temperatures @xmath41 were increased from 1200@xmath42c for the first up to 1550@xmath42c for the final firing for the first series of samples . in order to increase the curie temperature we prepared a second series of undoped sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 samples with more sintering steps and longer final sintering times at lower ( 1300@xmath42c ) temperatures . for this series",
    "we find the highest curie temperatures , which correspond to the values reported in literature .",
    "this most likely is caused by a slightly higher oxygen content in these samples compared to those sintered at higher temperatures in the same reducing atmosphere .",
    "the use of the thermobalance allowed to monitor the ongoing reaction process due to the associated weight loss of the samples .",
    "the exact oxygen content of the investigated samples has not been determined .",
    "however , due to the very similar preparation procedure for the samples used for the study of electron doping , we can assume a similar oxygen content .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were characterized by x - ray powder diffractometry to detect parasitic phases , e.g. the insulating compound srwo@xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , even in samples containing srwo@xmath43 no chromium containing parasitic phases could be detected .",
    "the most simple explanation for this observation is the high vapor pressure of cr@xmath6o@xmath40 resulting in a loss of chromium .",
    "however , no weight loss has been found in the thermogravimetric measurement .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that the formation of the mixed phase @xmath0cr@xmath44w@xmath45o@xmath46 compensates for the missing sr and w due to the srwo@xmath43 impurity phase .",
    "while the double perovskite sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 can be grown as single crystal @xcite , our attempts to grow single crystals of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 by floating zone melting failed so far due to the high vapor pressure of cr@xmath6o@xmath40 at the melting point .",
    "epitaxial thin films of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 were fabricated in a uhv laser molecular beam epitaxy ( l - mbe ) system @xcite .",
    "the details of the thin film deposition have been described recently @xcite .",
    "[ tem ] shows a transmission electron micrograph of an epitaxial sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 thin film grown on a srtio@xmath40 ( 001 ) substrate .",
    "the image shows that the thin film grows epitaxially with high crystalline quality .",
    "the @xmath47-axis oriented films have been analyzed using a high resolution 4-circle x - ray diffractometer .",
    "only ( @xmath48 ) peaks could be detected and typically , rocking curves of the ( 004 ) peak had a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of only 0.02 to 0.03@xmath49 , which is very close to the fwhm of the substrate peak .",
    "moreover , an afm analysis of the sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 films showed that they have a very small surface roughness of the order of one unit cell @xcite . in this",
    "study the thin films were used for optical measurements in order to determine the band structure .",
    "it is well known that the tolerance factor @xmath50 determines the crystal structure of perovskites @xmath51o@xmath40 @xcite . only for @xmath50 close to unity",
    "a cubic perovskite structure is obtained . for @xmath52 a tilt and rotation of the oxygen octahedra",
    "is obtained compensating for the misfit of the ionic radii of the involved @xmath3 and @xmath14 cations .",
    "hence , the deviation of the tolerance factor from the ideal value @xmath53 can be used as a measure for the internal strain in perovskites induced by the different radii of the @xmath3 and @xmath14 cations .",
    "this can be seen from the definition of @xmath50 given by @xmath54 here , @xmath55 denotes the average ionic radius for the ions on the @xmath14-site . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the strain is compensated by a tilt and rotation of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "this results in a deviation of the @xmath14-o-@xmath14 bond angles from the ideal value of @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    "the connecting pattern of the oxygen octahedra is rhombohedral , whereas it is orthorhombic for lower values of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "a simple consequence of the deviation of the bond angles from @xmath57 is a decrease in the hopping amplitude because the electron transfer between the @xmath14 sites is via o  @xmath59-states .",
    "this , in turn , results in a decrease of the one - electron bandwidth @xmath60 . for @xmath61 ,",
    "a hexagonal structure is expected which is classified by the stacking sequence of the @xmath14o@xmath1 octahedra @xcite .",
    ".overview on the crystallographic properties of the investigated samples of the @xmath0crwo@xmath1 series with @xmath2 .",
    "the tolerance @xmath50 factor was calculated using the spuds simulation software @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bigtable ]      fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for the double perovskites @xmath0crwo@xmath1 with @xmath62 .",
    "all samples show an increase of the resistivity with decreasing temperature .",
    "since the investigated samples are polycrystalline , the influence of grain boundaries plays an important role .",
    "hence , the observed semiconductor like resistivity vs temperature curves may be related to the grain boundary resistance , whereas the intrinsic resistance of the double perovskites may be metallic .",
    "although the intrinsic resistivity behavior can not be unambiguously derived from our measurements , the fact that @xmath63 for @xmath64 ( see inset of fig .  [ fig : res ] ) provides significant evidence for a metallic behavior in the sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 sample . here , @xmath65 is the electrical conductivity .",
    "the observed trend that the resistivity increases , if sr@xmath6 is replaced by ca@xmath6 and even more by ba@xmath6 , can be understood as follows : in contrast to the cubic perovskite sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 , ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 has a distorted perovskite structure with a @xmath14-o-@xmath14 bonding angle deviating from 180@xmath42 .",
    "this result in a reduction of the overlap between the relevant orbitals and , hence , the hopping amplitude . finally , the ba@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound has the highest resistivity most likely due to its hexagonal structure ( see table  [ table : samples ] ) .",
    "the magnetotransport properties of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 already has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we found , that polycrystalline samples containing a large number of grain boundaries show a large negative low - field magnetoresistance , @xmath66/r(0)$ ] , of up to -41% at 5k . at room temperature ,",
    "this effect is reduced to a few percent .",
    "the large grain boundary @xmath67 effect at low temperatures indicates that sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 has a large spin polarization of the charge carries and due to its high curie temperature may be an interesting candidate for magnetoelectronic devices operating room - temperature .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] we plot the curie temperature @xmath4 , the saturation magnetization @xmath68 , and the ionic radii versus the tolerance factor for the series @xmath0crwo@xmath1 .",
    "it is evident that the curie temperature is largest for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 ( @xmath5k ) , whereas it is suppressed strongly for ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 ( @xmath69k ) .",
    "we attribute this fact to the small ionic radius of ca@xmath9 , which results in @xmath70 and , in turn , in a distorted perovskite structure .",
    "this results in a reduction of the effective hopping interactions between cr  @xmath27 and w  @xmath71 states , leading to a reduced spin splitting of the conduction band  @xcite .",
    "this naturally reduces the magnetic coupling strength and hence the @xmath4 .",
    "the saturation magnetization @xmath68 is known to depend strongly on the amount @xmath72 of antisites , with @xmath73 for no antisites and @xmath74 for 50% antisites or complete disorder . by simply assuming the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled cr and w sublattices , a maximum saturation magnetization of @xmath75 is expected for @xmath73 , which is decreasing to zero for @xmath74 .",
    "that is , this assumption leads to @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath68 is the saturation magnetization in units of @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the magnetic moments of the cr@xmath10 and w@xmath21 ions in units of @xmath80 , respectively . comparing the experimental data to",
    "this simple model prediction leads to a surprisingly good agreement for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath81f.u .",
    "is very close to the value of @xmath82f.u .",
    "expected from eq.([eq : msat ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig : f]b also shows that the saturation magnetization of ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 is larger than for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 despite the much lower curie temperature of the latter .",
    "the obvious reason for that is the lower amount of antisites in ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 . from the measured value of @xmath84",
    "we expect @xmath85f.u . for ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 which is slightly larger than the measured value of @xmath86f.u ..",
    "the reason for the observation that the experimental @xmath87 value is below the one predicted by eq.([eq : msat ] ) most likely is the distorted crystal structure of ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ba@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound are completely different from those of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 and ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 . here",
    ", the large ionic radius of ba@xmath9 enlarges @xmath50 well above unity .",
    "this causes a structural phase transition towards a hexagonal structure , where the ferromagnetic interaction is strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , not only @xmath4 is strongly suppressed ( @xmath88k , in contrast to @xmath89k for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 ) , but also the saturation magnetization ( @xmath90f.u . ) is close to zero .",
    "this clearly indicates the strong effect of the structural phase transition on the magnetic interaction .",
    "we note that we can exclude the possibility that the very small @xmath68 value is due to strong disorder .",
    "evidently , there should be almost complete disorder to suppress @xmath68 close to zero .",
    "however , in the ba@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound the two different @xmath14 sites establish a certain amount of order , since almost all w ions occupy the @xmath91 site .",
    "whether the observed behavior is related to a canted antiferromagnetic phase or simply to the presence of minority phases has to be clarified .",
    "[ fig : acwomag ] shows that the magnetic interactions for all three compounds @xmath0crwo@xmath1 is ferromagnetic .",
    "however , the strongly reduced saturation magnetization of ba@xmath6crwo@xmath1 and the upturn in magnetization vs. temperature curve at low temperatures indicates that ferromagnetic interactions are small and that there may be paramagnetic regions in the sample .",
    "the substitution of sr by ca evidently results in a strong reduction of @xmath4 , however , the ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 samples are still clearly ferromagnetic .",
    "again , the important point is that only the compound with @xmath39 has optimum magnetic properties with respect to applications in magnetoelectronics .",
    "we also have performed measurements of the coercive field @xmath92 . at low temperature",
    "we obtained @xmath93oe for the sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound and @xmath94oe for the ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound .",
    "furthermore , for the sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 the coercive field was found to depend on the preparation conditions .",
    "for example , lowering the final firing temperature from 1550@xmath42c to 1300@xmath42c was found to increase @xmath92 from 450 to 1200oe . in agreement with the findings for the doped",
    "manganites @xcite , the coercive field increases with decreasing @xmath50 .",
    "this observation can be easily understood , since the induced structural distortions can effectively act as pinning centers for domain wall movement . in those cases where a large remanent magnetization and/or coercive field are important for applications ,",
    "the use of double perovskites with reduced values of @xmath50 obtained by suitable substitution on the @xmath3-site may be desirable .",
    "comparing our results for the series @xmath0crwo@xmath1 with @xmath95 to other double perovskite compounds summarized in table  [ bigtable ] , it is evident that the suppression of @xmath4 as a function of the deviation of the tolerance factor from its ideal value of @xmath53 is a general trend : it is only weak for the series @xmath0femoo@xmath1 with @xmath36 , where @xmath4 varies between 310k and 420k @xcite .",
    "however , it is also strong for the series @xmath0crreo@xmath1 with @xmath96k for sr@xmath6crreo@xmath1 and @xmath97k for ca@xmath6crreo@xmath1 @xcite . in general",
    ", a high curie temperature can only be realized in double perovskites of the composition @xmath98o@xmath1 having a tolerance factor close to unity .",

    "kanamori and terakura extended this idea to explain ferromagnetism in many other systems , where nonmagnetic elements positioned between high - spin @xmath27 elements contribute to the stabilization of ferromagnetic coupling between the @xmath27 elements @xcite .",

    "[ fig : models]a ) resulting from the hopping interactions .",
    "this kinetic energy driven mechanism leads to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the delocalized mo  @xmath29 and the localized fe  @xmath27 electrons , since the energy is lowered by populating the mo  @xmath29 spin - down band  @xcite .",

    "the question now arises , whether the above model also applies for the @xmath0crwo@xmath1 compounds .",

    "it is known that for a @xmath57 bond angle , @xmath111 decreases with increasing bond length @xmath114 roughly as @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the effective hopping amplitude between the transition metal ions @xmath14 has an even stronger dependence on @xmath114 .",
    "hence , a significant increase of @xmath111 and , in turn , @xmath4 is expected with a reduction of the bond length . applying this consideration to the investigated series @xmath0crwo@xmath1 we would expect the largest @xmath4 for the ca@xmath6crwo@xmath1 compound due to its smallest cell volume and , hence , shortest bond length .",
    "however , experimentally the largest @xmath4 was found for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 .",

    "whether or not the differences between the manganites and the double perovskites are related to the different mechanism stabilizing ferromagnetism in these compounds has to be clarified .",
    "we note , however , that the different behavior of the manganites and the double perovskites is likely to be related to different mechanisms . in manganites the polarization of the conduction band is driven by the hund s coupling ( intra atomic ) between the @xmath26 and the @xmath25 states , which is not sensitive to the details of the band structure .",
    "in contrast , in the double perovskites the spin polarization of the conduction band is itself dependent on the band structure and therefore is more intimately linked to it .",

    "x - ray analysis showed that the lattice parameter slightly decreases from @xmath130  ( @xmath123 ) to @xmath131  ( @xmath129 ) as expected since the ionic radius of la@xmath10 is smaller than that of sr@xmath9 .",
    "however , the crystal structure of all samples remained cubic .",

    "all samples of this series have been fired between 1530 and @xmath133c in reducing atmosphere . for the undoped sample this results in a smaller curie temperature of about 390k as compared to about 460k for the samples fired at @xmath134c .",
    "the reason for that most likely is a slightly smaller oxygen content in the sample fired at a higher temperature .",
    "since a reduced oxygen content corresponds to an effective electron doping , for the doping series we compare only samples prepared under identical conditions .",

    "as will be discussed in the following , for the series sr@xmath19la@xmath20crwo@xmath1 the measured reduction of @xmath68 most likely is caused by both electron doping and disorder .",
    "we first discuss the expected reduction of @xmath68 due to the increasing amount of antisites .",
    "we note that that several authors have found a reduction of @xmath68 following the increase of antisites @xcite .",
    "this behavior is consistent with simple monte carlo simulation studies @xcite .",
    "however , also more complicated models @xcite predict a reduction of @xmath68 with increasing amount of antisites due to charge transfer effects @xcite . in a first approach",
    "we can analyze our data using eq.([eq : msat ] ) . with the measured @xmath139 values for the amount of antisites we can calculate @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the calculated @xmath68 values are significantly larger than the measured ones .",
    "this suggests that the observed reduction of the saturation magnetization can not be explained by the increasing amount of antisites alone ( at least within the simple model yielding eq.([eq : msat ] ) ) .",
    "however , we also have to keep in mind that electron doping itself contributes to the reduction of @xmath68 . according to the illustration given in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a it is evident that electron doping in the @xmath0femoo@xmath1 system increases the spin - down magnetic moment at the mo site , indicating that the electrons are filled into the mo @xmath141 band and thereby reduce @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig : models]b , the same mechanism holds for the sr@xmath19la@xmath20crwo@xmath1 system .",
    "that is , our results suggest that the observed reduction of the saturation magnetization with increasing la@xmath10 substitution is caused both by an increase of the amount of antisites and an increase of the number of conduction electrons .    summarizing our discussion of the saturation magnetization we would like to emphasize that a variation of the doping level in most cases is correlated with a variation of the amount of disorder , since doping contributes to a reduction of the difference of the valence states of cr and w ( fe and mo ) what in turn results in an increasing amount of antisites @xcite",
    "unfortunately , due to this fact the experimental situation is not completely clear .",
    "while in @xcite for sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 and also in our study for sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 la doping is clearly correlated with higher disorder , in @xcite the amount of antisites seems to be constant in sr@xmath19la@xmath20femoo@xmath1 for almost the whole doping series from @xmath123 to @xmath142 . for the system sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 , the suppression of @xmath68 is stronger than for the system sr@xmath6femoo@xmath1 , probably due to the fact that the cr and w ions are easier to disorder because of their similar ionic radii .",
    "we finally note that in general both increasing doping and disorder can destroy the underlying half - metallic ferromagnetic state in double perovskites , thereby significantly populating / depopulating the different spin channels leading to a sharp decrease in @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we next discuss the influence of la doping on the curie temperature .",
    "it is evident that an enhancement of @xmath4 by doping would be of great importance for possible applications of the double perovskites in spintronic devices .",
    "however , both the experimental data on the variation of @xmath4 with electron doping as well as the theoretical interpretation is controversial at present . in single crystals of sr@xmath19la@xmath20femoo@xmath1 moritomo _ et al .",

    "we note that part of the experimental discrepancies may be related to large error bars in the determination of @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig : la - tc ] that in all our samples there are minor phases with optimum @xmath4 close to about 400k .",

    "that is , the observed decrease of @xmath4 with increasing doping level seems to support the model presented in @xcite ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : models ] ) .",
    "however , we have to take into account that by la doping besides the number of electrons we also increase the amount of disorder",

    "the broad band corresponds to the hybridized cr  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) and w  @xmath71 ( @xmath26 ) levels .",
    "that is , according to the band structure calculation we expect a half - metallic behavior for the double perovskite sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 .",
    "a similar result but with slightly larger band gaps has been reported recently by jeng _",
    "the result of the band structure calculation is in agreement with the model assumptions made above .",
    "the cr  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) spin - up subband is completely filled and there is a gap to the cr  @xmath27 ( @xmath38 ) spin - up subband lying about 0.5ev above the fermi level .",

    "as determined from fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) transmission measurements , the films remain transparent down to 0.2ev , however , @xmath153 is increasing significantly towards lower photon energies .",
    "the optical measurements agree fairly well with the band structure calculations .",
    "the increase of the absorption coefficient of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 above 4ev can most probably be attributed to a charge transfer transition between the p - like spin - up and -down oxygen bands at @xmath158ev below the fermi - level into the oxygen / metal bands at + 1ev above the fermi - level .",
    "the absorption shoulder around 1ev coincides roughly with the energy gap at the fermi level in the spin - up band , and is therefore probably caused by transitions from the cr spin - up @xmath26 states below the fermi - level into the oxygen / metal bands around + 1ev above the fermi - level .",
    "unfortunately , due to the substrate absorption below 0.2ev , no optical information is available in the infrared region which would allow a more definitive statement with respect to the density of states at the fermi level and the half - metallic character of sr@xmath6crwo@xmath1 .",

    "the observation that a tolerance factor @xmath39 yields the highest @xmath4 has been explained within a model , where ferromagnetism is stabilized by the energy gain contributed by the negative spin polarization on the nonmagnetic w - site due to hybridization of the cr  @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) and the w  @xmath71 ( @xmath26 ) states .",
