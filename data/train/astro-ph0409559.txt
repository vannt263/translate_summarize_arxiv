    "the ci j=10 line emission emerging from molecular clouds has been detected early ( phillips & huggins 1981 ) , but its interpetation as emanating from only a narrow cii / ci / co transition zone at the surface of these clouds ( e.g. tielens & hollenbach 1985a , b ) seems to preclude its use as a bulk h@xmath3 gas tracer , except perhaps to derive lower limits .",
    "nevertheless , despite the considerable difficulties involved in imaging wide areas in ci emission ( caused by an unfavorable atmospheric window at 492 ghz , and the small beams of single - pixel detectors mounted on large aperture sub - mm telescopes ) , early work has shown ci to be widely distributed and well - correlated with other h@xmath3 gas mass tracers such as @xmath8co ( keene 1985 ; keene 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "further observational efforts have confirmed this co - ci concomitance in molecular clouds together with a remarkably constant @xmath9 ratio over the _ bulk _ of the co - bright gas ( ojha et al .",
    "2001 ; ikeda et al .",
    "a new comprehensive study has shown how this could be established and advocated the use of ci line emission as a molecular gas mass tracer in galaxies ( papadopoulos , thi , & viti 2004 ) .",
    "ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are powered mainly by starburst events ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) that yield @xmath10 making them the most luminous objects in the local universe ( sanders et al . 1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "a number of reasons make them a good sample to test ci emission as a bulk h@xmath3 gas mass tracer in galaxies , namely :    \\a ) they are gas - rich systems but with their h@xmath3 distributions usually so compact ( e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ; bryant & scoville 1999 ) that single pointings with single - dish telescopes are adequate to record all their ci / co flux density ( of prime importance for the difficult ci observations ) .",
    "\\b ) their h@xmath3 gas mass has been estimated using several methods other than the standard one based solely on the @xmath11co j=10 line luminosity ( e.g. solomon et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; glenn & hunter 2001 ; lihong et al .",
    "thus they constitute an ideal test - bed for any new h@xmath3 mass - tracing method .",
    "\\c ) in these merger / starburst systems intense fuv radiation and powerful tidal fields drive a two - phase differentation of the molecular gas ( aalto et al .",
    "the diffuse , @xmath5co - bright , and non - virialized intercloud phase is probably responsible for the systematic overestimate of h@xmath3 gas mass by factors of @xmath12 in starburst environments ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to see how a new method of measuring h@xmath3 gas mass will fare under such conditions .",
    "\\d ) early applications of this method in arp 220 ( gerin & phillips 1998 ) , and the cloverleaf qso at z= 2.5 ( weiss et al .",
    "2003 ) have yielded an h@xmath3 mass that is in good agreement with the standard methods that use @xmath5co and dust continuum emission .",
    "\\e ) ulirgs , as possible precursors of optically - bright qsos ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) , or as the nearby templates for starburst , dust - enshrouded galaxies observed at high redshifts ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) , are interesting systems in their own right .",
    "molecular gas being the `` fuel '' of their prodigious star - forming activity makes any new method of estimating its mass particularly valuable .    in this work we present new sensitive observations of the ci j=10 line in two prominent ulirgs namely arp 220 and ngc 6240 , and collect available ci measurements in similar objects from the literature , which are then used to estimate their h@xmath3 gas mass content . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt an @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we used the 15-meter james clerk maxwel telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii , to observe the @xmath15@xmath16 ( j=10 ) fine structure line at @xmath17 ghz in the ulirgs arp  220 ( january 3nd 2003 ) and ngc 6240 ( february 27th 1999 ) .",
    "cold and extremely dry weather with @xmath18 ensured excellent conditions for high - frequency observations with overall system temperatures of the ssb - tuned w - receiver of @xmath19 k. rapid beam - switching at a chop - throw of 30@xmath20 ( az ) with a frequency of 1 hz produced stable baselines , and the use of the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) at its widest mode of 1.8 ghz ( @xmath21 ) enabled the full velocity coverage of the wide extragalactic lines often observed in such galaxies .",
    "this is particularly important since e.g. arp 220 has a @xmath22 and in the past multiple frequency settings of the spectrometer were necessary in order to cover the entire ci j=10 line ( gerin & phillips 1998 ) .",
    "the aperture efficiency was measured repeatedly using mars , an important task in sub - mm telescopes operating at such high frequencies since residual thermal distortions and mechanical deformations of the dish can then affect their performance significantly .",
    "we deduced @xmath23 , lower than the one quoted in jcmt observer s guide ( @xmath24 ) , but within the expected variations ( friberg , private communication ) .",
    "the beam size at these frequencies ( used to estimate the aforementioned efficiencies ) is @xmath25 .",
    "frequent pointing checks showed the pointing error to be @xmath26 .",
    "frequent observations of strong spectral - line sources yielded a calibration uncertainty of @xmath27 , which along with the @xmath28 uncertainty of adopted value of aperture efficiency dominate the error in the reported velocity - integrated line fluxes .",
    "these are estimated from    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ( @xmath31=source diameter ) accounts for the geometric coupling of the gaussian part of the beam with a finite - sized , disk - like source . for ngc 6240",
    "it is @xmath32 , while for all other sources @xmath33 .",
    "the ci spectra are shown in figures 1 , 2 along with overlayed @xmath4co and @xmath8co j=21 spectral lines .",
    "the correspondance is excellent , while the weakness of the observed @xmath8co emission ( an often - used alternative to the much more optically thick @xmath5co ) elevates ci emission ( if indeed fully concomitant with h@xmath3 ) to a good alternative h@xmath3 gas tracer in ulirgs .",
    "we use the measured @xmath34 to deduce the global molecular gas mass from    @xmath35^{-1 } \\rm \\left[\\frac{a_{10}}{10^{-7 } s^{-1}}\\right]^{-1 } q_{10 } ^{-1 } \\left [ \\frac{s_{ci}}{jy\\ km\\ s^{-1}}\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 , the einstein coefficient @xmath37 , and @xmath38 depends on the gas excitation conditions ( see papadopoulos et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath39/[h_2]$ ] abundance chosen here is @xmath40 , identical to that used by weiss et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their h@xmath3 mass estimate in the cloverleaf .",
    "this value is the average between the minimum found for the bulk of the orion a and b clouds ( @xmath41 ; ikeda et al .",
    "2002 ) and in the starburst environment of the nucleus of m82 ( @xmath42 ; white et al .",
    "1994 ) ( assuming @xmath43/[h_2]=10^{-4}$ ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 where @xmath44 can be directly compared with the best available @xmath45 estimates . in the cases where",
    "a range of physical conditions is reported for the gas , the average @xmath46 excitation factor is adopted .    the agreement is remarkable , especially given that the co - derived h@xmath3 masses reported here are based on much better methods than the mere application of the galactic @xmath47 factor ( which in ulirgs overestimates h@xmath3 mass by a factor of @xmath48 ) .",
    "it must be noted though that even such methods leave uncertainties of a factor of @xmath49 in their @xmath50 estimates ( e.g. see tacconi et al . 1999 ) . in the one case of iras 10565 + 2448 it is @xmath51 , possibly too large a difference to be attributed solely to the aforementioned uncertainties of the co - based methods . in starburst environments",
    "higher @xmath52 values are possibly more appropriate ( e.g. schilke et al . 1993 and references therein ) . indeed , assuming ci as abundant as in the center of m 82",
    "would keep the ci and co - deduced h@xmath3 mass estimates in agreement within factors of @xmath53 , while bringing @xmath54 in iras 10565 + 2448 in better accord to the co - deduced value .",
    "nevertheless the latter case highlights an _ irreducible _ uncertainty when using optically thin emission from _ any _ molecular or atomic species to trace h@xmath3 gas mass .",
    "it is important to note that unlike quiescent spirals ulirgs can have @xmath55 of their h@xmath3 mass at densities @xmath56 ( gao & solomon 2004 ) , for which one - dimensional static pdr models predict much lower @xmath52 values , effectively rendering ci emission incapable of tracing its mass .",
    "this does not seem to be happening , lending further support to a full ci - h@xmath3 concomitance over most of the parameter space characterizing the physical conditions of h@xmath3 in galaxies .",
    "furthermore ci emission may be a good alternative molecular gas tracer particularly in ulirgs because the often - used optically thin @xmath6co emission is very weak , while @xmath5co j=10 and a galactic conversion factor overestimates @xmath57 because of the presence of non - virialized @xmath5co - bright h@xmath3 gas .",
    "apart from the uncertainty of the assumed @xmath52 ( which plagues also the @xmath8co measurements since c and @xmath8co emerge from tightly coupled chemical routes ) , the ci j=10 line is a more straightforward h@xmath3 mass tracer than co due to a simpler partition function and a significantly reduced sensitivity to the ambient gas excitation conditions .",
    "it can be argued that a proper comparison between the various tracers of molecular gas must be between transitions within the same frequency domain because of the significant variations in the atmospheric absorption ( and thus in the resulting effective system sensitivity ) across the mm / sub - mm wavelengths . for ci and co",
    "this is presented by papadopoulos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where it is shown that while the @xmath5co j=43 ( 461 ghz ) transition can be indeed much stronger than ci j=10 , the latter offers decisive advantages for cooler and/or diffuse gas ( @xmath58 ) where the emission of the former is significantly surpressed . in ulirgs",
    "the very weak @xmath59co emission makes the much brighter ci j=10 a better alternative h@xmath3 mass tracer when using the same telescope to observe unresolved sources .",
    "this of course assumes ci observations conducted during suitable dry weather conditions , which occur much less frequently than the those needed for sensitive @xmath60co observations .",
    "however this situation is expected to change drastically when the new generation of mm / sub - mm single dish telescopes ( apex ) and interferometer arrays ( alma ) become operational in the excellent sites in the atacama desert plateau in northern chile . there",
    "dry atmospheric conditions , suitable for ci j=10 observations , are expected for @xmath61 of the time and with much less pronounced diurnal variations ( radford & nyman 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "more ci j=10 observations of ulirgs are urgently needed to further test the notion of ci as a bulk h@xmath3 gas mass tracer .",
    "application of this technique to quiescent nearby galaxies is also of prime importance but then extensive ci imaging may be needed to match the co and ci imaged areas .",
    "finally ci observations of galaxies at high redshifts with known co detections can further test the effectiveness of this method while circumventing the problem of the low atmospheric transmission at 492  ghz ( j=10 ) and 809  ghz ( j=21 ) .",
    "we report on new sensitive ci j=10 measurements in the two prominent ulirgs ngc  6240 and arp 220 , and collect ci measurements available for similar objects from the literature .",
    "we then use them to derive the molecular gas mass under the assumption of fully concomitant ci , co , and h@xmath3 and find very good agreement between the ci and the co - based estimates within the uncertainties of the two methods .",
    "the faintness of the @xmath6co emission ( often used instead of the more optically thick @xmath5co ) in these two galaxies and in similar systems makes ci emission a good alternative tracer of their molecular gas mass .",
    "however given the much stricter constraints on the atmospheric conditions needed for sensitive ci observations ( very dry weather ) than those for @xmath8co , the practical advantages of ci as a good optically thin h@xmath3 gas mass tracer will be fully realised when the new generation of mm / sub - mm single - dish ( apex ) and interferometer arrays ( alma ) become operational in cerro chajnantor in the atacama desert plateau .",
    "we advocate more ci j=10 observations of similar objects at low as well as high redshifts ( where ci lines are redshifted to more transparent atmospheric windows ) in order to further test the potential of ci to trace bulk h@xmath3 gas mass in galaxies .",
    "we thank the referee for comments on the original manuscript that greatly improved the presentation of the main thesis of this work .",
