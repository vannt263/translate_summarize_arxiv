    "over the past few years , the interest in small trapped bose and fermi gases , and mixtures thereof , has increased tremendously for a number of reasons .",
    "first , atomic gases provide an ideal platform for investigating phenomena related to efimov physics  @xcite .",
    "while the majority of investigations of the efimov effect have focused on the three - body system , larger systems have attracted considerable attention recently from theoretical and experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "second , small trapped atomic systems can be realized by loading an atomic gas into an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "if the tunneling between lattice sites is small and if the interactions between neighboring sites can be neglected , then each lattice site provides a realization of a trapped few - body system . in this setting , one interesting prediction is that effective three- and higher - body interactions should emerge  @xcite .",
    "third , small atomic gases can be viewed as a bridge between two - body and many - body systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in most cases ,",
    "the two - body system is well characterized , making a bottom - up approach attractive .",
    "such an approach treats increasingly larger systems and eventually connects observables for mesoscopic systems with those predicted by many - body theories , e.g. , through the use of the local density approximation .",
    "fourth , few - body systems often times allow for highly accurate treatments , thereby providing much needed benchmark results .",
    "for example , a number of lattice - based approaches are presently being applied to trapped cold atom systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for lattice - based treatments of the homogeneous system ) .",
    "while these approaches promise to be very powerful , currently only a few benchmark results are available that allow for a careful assessment of their validity regimes .",
    "this paper treats equal - mass two - component fermi gases under external harmonic confinement with short - range @xmath0-wave interactions .",
    "our work builds on the rapidly expanding number of papers that treat trapped three - dimensional few - fermion systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the ground state of trapped equal - mass two - component fermi gases , e.g. , has been investigated numerically by the fixed - node diffusion monte carlo approach  @xcite and the stochastic variational approach  @xcite . in the strongly - interacting unitary regime , the properties of the system  motivated by analytical treatments that exploit the scale invariance of equal - mass fermi gases at unitarity  @xcite  have been interpreted within the hyperspherical framework  @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the excitation spectrum at unitarity has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "in addition , small two - component fermi gases have been investigated as a function of the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1  @xcite . for small @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,",
    "the energy crossover curve has been analyzed by applying first order perturbation theory to a weakly - attractive atomic fermi gas  @xcite . for small @xmath10 , @xmath9 , in contrast",
    ", the energy crossover curve has been analyzed by applying first order perturbation theory to a weakly - repulsive molecular gas  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "small two - component fermi gases have also provided the first high precision tests  @xcite of the tan relations  @xcite that apply to both inhomogeneous and homogeneous @xmath0-wave interacting fermi gases .",
    "following up on our earlier work , this paper presents new results for trapped equal - mass fermi gases with up to @xmath12 , where @xmath7 and @xmath13 or 1 .",
    "our main results are : ( i ) we report extrapolated zero - range energies for five- and six - particle systems with @xmath14 and @xmath15 for various angular momenta at unitarity .",
    "( ii ) we present energy crossover curves for the @xmath14 system for the ground state and various excited states .",
    "( iii ) we present a detailed analysis of the dependence of the few - particle energies on the range of the underlying two - body potential .",
    "( iv ) we present structural properties for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath15 systems throughout the crossover , including unitarity .",
    "( v ) we quantify the correlations of few - fermion systems by analyzing the one- and two - body density matrices as well as the momentum distributions . in particular , we propose a measure of the molecular condensate fraction and apply it to few - fermion systems with up to @xmath12 atoms .",
    "related analyses have previously been pursued for bosonic gases  @xcite and one - dimensional systems  @xcite , but we are not aware of analogous studies for trapped three - dimensional two - component fermi gases .",
    "section  [ sec_theory ] introduces the system hamiltonian and the stochastic variational approach employed to solve the time - independent schrdinger equation for small trapped two - component systems .",

    "section  [ sec_results ] presents and interprets our results for various parameter combinations .",
    "lastly , section  [ sec_conclusions ] summarizes our main results and concludes .",
    "mathematical derivations and discussions of technical aspects are collected in appendices  [ sec_appendixa ] through [ sec_appendixc ] .",
    "our model hamiltonian that describes equal - mass two - component fermi gases with @xmath3 spin - up and @xmath4 spin - down atoms ( @xmath7 and @xmath19 ) under external spherically symmetric harmonic confinement with angular trapping frequency @xmath20 reads @xmath21 here , @xmath22 denotes the atom mass and @xmath23 the position vector of the @xmath24th particle measured with respect to the trap center ( with @xmath25 ) ; the first @xmath3 position vectors correspond to the spin - up atoms and the last @xmath4 position vectors to the spin - down atoms .",

    "we restrict ourselves to two - body potentials that support no free - space @xmath0-wave two - body bound state and one free - space @xmath0-wave two - body bound state for negative @xmath1 and positive @xmath1 , respectively . if the scattering length @xmath1 is notably larger than the range @xmath8 , then the properties of small trapped two - component fermi gases are universal , i.e. , independent of the details of the underlying two - body potential  @xcite . thus , we limit ourselves to parameter combinations with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for these parameter combinations , energy shifts due to @xmath34-wave or higher partial wave scattering between unlike fermions are negligible . in a few cases ,",
    "we perform calculations for different @xmath8 and explicitly extrapolate to the @xmath35 limit .",
    "our goal is to solve the time - independent schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ham ] ) , and to analyze the energy spectrum and structural properties . to this end",
    ", we use that the total wave function @xmath36 separates into a relative part @xmath37 and a center - of - mass part @xmath38 .",
    "the relative wave function @xmath37 is written in terms of jacobi vectors @xmath39 ; its determination through the stochastic variational approach is reviewed briefly in the next subsection . throughout",
    ", we assume that center - of - mass excitations are absent , i.e. , we assume that the center of mass wave function is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a normalization constant and @xmath42 the center of mass vector , @xmath43 .",
    "the relative wave function @xmath37 is a simultaneous eigen function of the relative hamiltonian @xmath44 , the square of the relative orbital angular momentum operator , the @xmath45-projection of the relative orbital angular momentum operator and the parity operator .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath37 and the associated eigen energies @xmath46 are labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath2 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .      to determine the relative eigen functions @xmath37 and relative eigen energies @xmath46",
    ", we employ the stochastic variational ( sv ) approach  @xcite .",
    "our implementation follows that described in refs .",
    "@xcite , and here we only emphasize a few key points .",
    "the sv approach expands the relative wave function @xmath37 in terms of a basis set .",
    "the basis functions themselves are not linearly independent , and the determination of the eigen energies requires the solution of a generalized eigen value problem that involves the hamiltonian matrix and the overlap matrix . just as with other basis set expansion techniques , the sv approach results in a variational upper bound to the exact eigen energies , i.e. , to the ground state energy and to the energies of excited states . for the interaction and confining potentials chosen in this work , the functional forms of the basis functions allow for an analytical evaluation of the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements .",
    "the proper fermionic symmetry of the basis functions is ensured through the application of a permutation operator @xmath49 . for the @xmath15 system , e.g. , @xmath49 consists of 36 permutations",
    "( 6 permutations each are required to anti - symmetrize the three spin - up and the three spin - down fermions ) .    while the functional forms of the basis functions are relatively simple , they are sufficiently flexible to describe short - range correlations that develop on a length scale of the order of the range @xmath8 and long - range correlations that develop on a length scale of the order of the oscillator length @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved through the use of a comparatively large number of variational parameters that are optimized semi - stochastically for each basis function . in this work ,",
    "we employ basis functions that are characterized by @xmath50 to @xmath51 parameters [ see eq .",

    "@xcite , for an explicit expression of the basis functions with arbitrary @xmath2 employed in this work ] . generally speaking ,",
    "the treatment of states with @xmath52 is numerically less challenging than that of states with other symmetries . as the range @xmath8 decreases or @xmath53 increases , the numerical complexity of the calculation increases .",
    "also , for a given @xmath8 and @xmath54 combination , the numerical complexity increases with increasing angular momentum . the largest calculation reported in sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] uses @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of fully anti - symmetrized basis functions . in many cases , however , the optimization procedure of the variational parameters is more important than the size of the basis set itself . in our implementation , e.g. , a notable fraction of the computational efforts is directed at optimizing the basis functions for a given @xmath56 as opposed to increasing @xmath56 .",
    "the motivation for keeping the basis set relatively small is two - fold .",
    "first , the use of highly optimized basis functions mitigates essentially all problems that would otherwise arise from the linear dependence of the basis functions  @xcite .",
    "second , the computational time required to calculate structural properties increases with increasing @xmath56 .    to calculate structural properties , we follow two different approaches .",
    "where possible , we determine the matrix elements for a given operator @xmath57 analytically , and determine the quantity @xmath58 by simply adding all matrix elements weighted by the appropriate expansion coefficients .",
    "this approach scales quadratically with @xmath56 and is , in most cases , more efficient than our second approch , a variational monte carlo calculation  @xcite that uses the wave function optimized by the stochastic variational approach . in particular , we calculate structural observables by performing a metropolis walk that samples the probability distribution @xmath59 . the expectation value of @xmath57",
    "is then determined by averaging over many possible realizations of the system . at each step , the density @xmath60 needs to be calculated , resulting in a scaling of the computational effort with @xmath61 , where the number of metropolis steps @xmath62 is generally much larger than @xmath56 .",
    "appendix  [ sec_appendixb ] details the monte carlo sampling scheme for a number of observables that quantify the correlations of the system .",

    "the density matrices not only lead to a practical route to determine the momentum distributions associated with the spin - up and spin - down atoms , but also serve to quantify the non - local correlations of the system .",
    "for example , for trapped single - species bose gases , an eigen value of the one - body density matrix of the order of 1 signals a large condensate fraction  @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for two - component fermions  @xcite . because of the anti - symmetric many - body wave function",
    ", none of the natural orbitals associated with the one - body density matrix can be occupied macroscopically . in fermionic systems ,",
    "an appreciable condensate fraction only arises if pairs are being formed  @xcite . to quantify the correlations associated with the formation of pairs",
    ", one needs to analyze the two - body density matrix . in the following ,",
    "we first introduce local structural observables and then non - local observables such as the one - body density matrix and the two - body density matrix .",
    "the analysis and discussions presented in this paper are partially motivated by analogous studies of small bosonic @xmath64he and fermionic @xmath65he droplets  @xcite . while these systems are significantly more dense than the atomic gases considered here , their characterization is based on the same theoretical framework .    specifically , we calculate the radial density @xmath66 for the spin - up atoms , where @xmath67 denotes the position vector of the spin - up atoms from the center of the trap .",
    "the normalization is chosen such that @xmath68 often times , it is more convenient to record the one - dimensional spherically symmetric component @xmath69 , @xmath70 instead . for @xmath71 states , e.g. , the radial density @xmath66 is not spherically symmetric , and @xmath66 and @xmath69 are different . for spin - imbalanced systems ,",
    "i.e. , for systems with @xmath72 , the radial densities for the spin - up and spin - down atoms are different . in this case",
    ", we also report @xmath73 for the spin - down atoms , which is defined analogously to @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , we calculate the pair distribution function @xmath74 for a spin - up atom and a spin - down atom .",

    "in addition to the one - body density matrix , we consider the two - body density matrix @xmath106 , @xmath107 which is obtained by integrating over all coordinates but the position vectors of one of the spin - up fermions and one of the spin - down fermions .",

    "we then define the reduced two - body density matrix @xmath110 through @xmath111 the quantity @xmath110 measures the non - local correlations between spin - up  spin - down pairs that are characterized by the same relative distance vector @xmath67 .",
    "however , as defined the reduced two - body density matrix @xmath110 does not distinguish between `` small '' and `` large '' pairs .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) , we expect that the system consists of @xmath4 point - like pairs and @xmath112 unpaired atoms and that the @xmath4 pairs form a molecular bose gas",
