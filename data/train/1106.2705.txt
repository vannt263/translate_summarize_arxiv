    "16 that the experimental and the theoretical cross sections become closer with increasing bombarding energy .",
    "this means that with increasing bombarding energy the quasifission yields near the entrance channel mass - region decrease with respect to the quasifission yields in other mass - regions .",
    "the quasifission yields near the entrance channel increase with @xmath128 .",
    "the quantum diffusion approach is applied to study the capture process in the reactions with deformed nuclei at sub - barrier energies .",
    "the available experimental data at energies above and below the coulomb barrier are well described , showing that the static quadrupole deformations of the interacting nuclei are the main reasons for the capture cross section enhancement at sub - barrier energies .",
    "since the deformations of the interacting nuclei mainly influence the slope of curve at @xmath122 and one can extract the ground state deformation of projectile or target from the experimental capture cross section data .",
    "due to a change of the regime of interaction ( the turning - off of the nuclear forces and friction ) at sub - barrier energies , the curve related to the capture cross section as a function of bombarding energy has smaller slope @xmath143  5 mev .",
    "this change is also reflected in the functions @xmath127 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "the mean - square angular momentum of captured system versus @xmath3 has a minimum and then saturates at sub - barrier energies .",
    "this behavior of @xmath127 would increase the expected anisotropy of the angular distribution of the products of fission and quasifission following capture .",
    "the astrophysical factor has a maximum and a minimum at energies below the barrier .",
    "the maximum of @xmath76-factor corresponds to the minimum of the @xmath0-factor .",
    "one can suggest the experiments to check these predictions .",
