    "there is evidence that the cepheid period - luminosity relation is not universal but differs in slope and zero point from galaxy - to - galaxy at a level of up to @xmath0 as a function of period ( cf.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite for a review ) .",
    "drastic as this conclusion is for studies of the extragalactic distance scale , it has been strengthened in confirming studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and from theoretical models as a function of chemical composition by many authors , starting perhaps with john @xcite , and including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and undoubtedly others .",
    "these studies show that the position of the borders of the the @xmath1 , @xmath2 instability strip in the hr diagram depends on chemical composition .",
    "if the strip borders vary in position and slope , so must the slope and zero point of the p - l relation , as worked through the pulsation equation in the following sections .    despite this evidence",
    ", the conclusion that different p - l relations apply in different galaxies has recently been challenged in the literature . in these papers",
    "it is said that the slopes of the cepheid p - l relations in other galaxies satisfy the slope of the p - l relation in the lmc and therefore that no slope differences with lmc have been demonstrated conclusively ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite are examples ) .",
    "however , this claim sets aside the parallel evidence that the slope and zero point of the ridge lines of the cepheid instability strips of the galaxy , lmc and smc themselves differ in temperature at a given period ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of @xcite ) , and hence , in luminosity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to again remind us that the slope of the p - l relation is rigidly coupled with the slope of the instability strip via the @xcite pulsation condition that @xmath3constant .",
    "hence , if the instability strip slope varies from galaxy - to - galaxy , so must the p - l slope .",
    "differences in the instability strips of the galaxy and smc were first set out by @xcite .",
    "they were made secure as temperature differences by @xcite , and have now been made definitive by the new ccd data by @xcite for lmc and smc and by @xcite for the galaxy , as summarized for the galaxy and lmc in figure  20 of @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we show the pulsation equation graphically and demonstrate from it the stated premise ; a slope difference in the ridge line of the instability strip leads to a slope difference in the p - l relation .",
    "the graphical solution here is parallel to the algebraic demonstration given elsewhere ( @xcite ,   7.3 ; @xcite ,   8) , and made more explicit here in   [ sec:03 ] .",
    "in an obvious way the ritter @xmath4 pulsation condition can be put into the observable parameters of period , luminosity , mass , and temperature by also using the stefan - boltzmann black body radiation condition that @xmath5 .",
    "the ritter plus black body condition is improved by model calculations for real stars by using details of the pulsating stellar atmosphere structure , leading to the more precise pulsation equation of @xmath6 .    as in previous papers",
    "we again use the van albada - baker @xcite pulsation equation .",
    "although it was calculated by them to apply to the lower mass rr lyrae stars , comparisons show that their predicted p - l relation is nearly identical with many other pulsation equations calculated for higher mass cepheids .",
    "examples are the equations by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "@xmath73@xmath8 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "@xmath75@xmath8 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "@xmath72@xmath8 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the near identity among the equations is discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsation equation by @xcite is @xmath9 it can be made into an equation , @xmath10 , for the lines of constant period in the hr diagram once a mass - luminosity relation for cepheids is used to eliminate mass from equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) .",
    "observational determinations of many cepheid masses are not available , and we must rely on theoretical mass values from calculated evolution tracks that pass through the instability strip . a summary of such tracks is given in tables 1 to 5 of @xcite for tracks calculated from the geneva models , in table  11 for the padua tracks , and table  12 for the saio - gautschy tracks .",
    "detailed references for these models are in @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite for solar metallicity and by @xcite for lower metallicities were also studied .    from all the models ,",
    "normalized at @xmath11 at @xmath12 , we have adopted @xmath13 from the tracks .",
    "this is everywhere within @xmath14 of the geneva and padua tables in @xcite for all metallicities .",
    "putting equation  ( [ eq:02 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) gives the equation of the lines of constant period to be @xmath15 this produces a family of lines in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 hr diagram as @xmath18 is varied .",
    "figure  [ fig:01 ] shows such a family for @xmath19 values of 0.4 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.3 , and 1.6 .",
    "the ridge - line instability strip for the galaxy is shown , using its equation of @xmath20 from @xcite , figure  20 .",
    "the blue and red strip borders are arbitrarily drawn parallel to the galaxy ridge line using a temperature width of @xmath21 from the galaxy ridge line .",
    "this is slightly wider than is observed ( fig .",
    "20 of @xcite ) , but is drawn to accommodate the dashed strip line of a toy galaxy shown with the equation @xmath22 , similar to the instability strip of lmc ( again fig .",
    "20 of @xcite ) , but drawn here without the break at 10 days .",
    "the toy galaxy strip ( the dashed line ) has been made to intersect the galaxy strip at @xmath23 to insure that the separate p - l relations also cross at this period .",
    "the ridge - line p - l relations are obtained in an obvious way by reading the @xmath16 ( ordinate ) values at the intersections of the instability strip with the constant period lines for both the galaxy and the toy model .",
    "the fact that the resulting ridge - line p - l relation obtained for the galaxy in this way differs from that of the toy model because of the different slopes of the instability strip ridge lines is obvious from this construction .    for @xmath24 , the instability strip has higher temperatures for the toy model than for the galaxy at a given period .",
    "hence , the intersection of the ridge - line strip with the constant period lines occurs at brigher lumimosities for the toy than for the galaxy , giving a p - l relation for the toy model that is brighter than for the galaxy for all periods smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath25 .",
    "hence the p - l relations will have different slopes , as was to be shown .",
    "the discussion here in words could complete the promised demonstration that the slope of the p - l relation is rigidly coupled with the slope of the instability strip ridge line in the hr diagram .",
    "however , to make the point more explicit , even to the point that the discussion becomes unnecessarily more elementary , bordering on pedantry , figure  [ fig:02 ] displays the two different p - l relations obtained by reading figure  [ fig:01 ] in this way .",
    "the slope values for the galaxy and the toy are marked in the figure , based on the adopted instability equations adopted for figure  [ fig:01 ] .",
    "these slopes are similar to the actual slope values measured for the galaxy and the smc from @xcite ( their eq .",
    "[ 17 ] ) and @xcite , hereafter @xcite ( their eq .",
    "[ 5 ] ) , and set out again in table  [ tab:01 ] here later .",
    "we can apply the pulsation equation directly to show the algebraic solution for the same problem using real data , both for the equations of the instability strips of the galaxy and lmc and the observed p - l relations .",
    "the demonstration made here uses the equations for observed p - l relations from @xcite in their equation  ( 17 ) for the galaxy and their equations  ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) for the lmc .",
    "these are put into equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) , which , together with the adopted mass - luminosity equation  ( [ eq:02 ] ) , gives a predicted @xmath17 , @xmath16 instability ridge - line relation .",
    "this predicted line is then compared with the observed instability strip equations shown in figure  20 of @xcite .",
    "we have used an explicit bolometric correction to change the @xmath26 values obtained from the observations into @xmath27 required in equations  ( [ eq:01 ] ) and ( [ eq:02 ] ) , and back to @xmath26 to compare the predictions from the pulsation equation with the observations .",
    "the bolometric corrections are interpolated from table  6 of @xcite for the appropriate metallicities and surface gravities of the cepheids .",
    "the turbulent velocity was assumed to be @xmath28 .",
    "the surface gravities vary with radius , mass , and luminosity and therefore with period as a surrogate as @xmath29 ( eq .  [ 49 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicities are assumed to be [ a / h]@xmath30 for the galaxy and @xmath31 for lmc .",
    "the mass is from equation  ( [ eq:02 ] ) .",
    "the obvious arithmetic is not shown .",
    "the resulting predictions of the instability strip ridge - line equations are these : @xmath32 for the galaxy at all periods , and , @xmath33 for @xmath34days for the lmc , and @xmath35 for @xmath36days , also for the lmc .",
    "note that the break in the @xmath37 instability strip relation at @xmath38days in equations  ( [ eq:05 ] ) and ( [ eq:06 ] ) is mirrored in the break in the p - l lmc relations given in equations  ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) of @xcite , and shown as figure  4 there .    for comparison with the predictions in equations  ( [ eq:04])([eq:06 ] ) here ,",
    "the _ observed _ ridge lines of the strips in the galaxy and the lmc , taken from the insert equations shown in figure  20 of @xcite , are @xmath39 for the galaxy at all periods , and @xmath40 for @xmath34days , and @xmath41 for @xmath36days for the lmc .    the near agreement of the predicted slopes of the instability strips in equations ( [ eq:04])([eq:06 ] ) with the observed slopes in equations ( [ eq:07])([eq:09 ] ) is the demonstration we are seeking .",
    "the agreement is good , but there is a disagreement in the temperature zero points between equations ( [ eq:04])([eq:06 ] ) and equations ( [ eq:07])([eq:09 ] ) by @xmath42 .",
    "the predicted temperatures are cooler than those observed .",
    "however , the difference is remarkably small , given the approximations we have made in the bolometric corrections , in the adopted temperature scale of @xcite , their table  6 , and in the adopted van albada - baker theoretical zero point in equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) .",
    "the temperature offset could be made zero if the zero point of the mass in equation  ( [ eq:02 ] ) would be made smaller by @xmath43 , but then the evolution mass would differ from the pulsation mass by this amount .",
    "this is the expression of the previous well known mass `` problem '' which is solved here by the temperature shift .    in this regard ,",
    "it is useful to remark that many of the temperature scales in the current literature , for example as summarized by @xcite or by @xcite , and including the one in @xcite that we have used here , differ among themselves by as much as @xmath44 in @xmath17 at fixed @xmath45 .",
    "this , then , is the temperature uncertainty in the temperature zero point in figure  20 of @xcite .",
    "our shifting of the predicted temperature relative to the observed temperatures in figure  [ fig:03 ] by @xmath46 is not excessive .",
    "the observed ( solid lines ) and the predicted ( dashed lines shifted by @xmath46 in @xmath17 ) instability strips for the galaxy and the lmc are shown in figure  [ fig:03 ] .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory , showing again that differences in the instability strip loci causes differences in the slopes of the p - l relations .",
    "hence the claims in the current literature , cited in the introduction , that a universal slope exists for the cepheid p - l relation are inconsistent with figures  [ fig:01][fig:03 ] which show different positions of the instability strip in different galaxies .",
    "the arguments given in the previous sections rely on knowledge of the temperatures of the instability strips .",
    "these can only be measured using reddening corrected colors , and these are reliable only if the reddening of the individual cepheids can be determined by some method other than by using a fiducial period - color ( p - c ) relation .",
    "the reason is that if the temperatures of the instability strips differ from galaxy - to - galaxy , presumably because of chemical composition differences , the p - c relations will also differ .",
    "there will be no correct fiducial p - c template from which to determine the reddening if the chemical compositions vary greatly .",
    "the intrinsic p - c relations will differ from galaxy - to - galaxy depending on the chemical composition , and the reddenings are therefore indeterminate .    presently , it is only the galaxy , lmc , and smc that can be subjected to the analysis given here because it is only for these galaxies that the reddening of their cepheids have been determined by methods other than by comparing with some adopted fiducial p - c relation .",
    "however , for some galaxies with enough cepheids , and where the differential reddening between the cepheids is small enough to be ignored , comparison of the p - l slopes can be made directly from the data .",
    "the result for the galaxy , ngc3351 , ngc4321 , lmc , smc , ic1613 , ngc3109 , and sextans a and b is shown in figure  [ fig:04 ] . the adopted data for the p - l relations are in table  [ tab:01 ]",
    ". the equations for the apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude p - l relations are @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "column  ( 2 ) is the @xmath49 of the oxygen - to - hydrogen ratio from table  4 of @xcite .",
    "column  ( 3 ) shows the observed value of @xmath50 , which is the slope of the apparent magnitude p - l relation taken from the same sources ( but changed slightly in a few entries here ) as were used for table  4 of @xcite .",
    "column  ( 4 ) lists the apparent magnitude p - l intercept , @xmath51 , as observed .",
    "column  ( 5 ) lists the @xmath52 distance modulus adopted in @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude p - l relation is in column  ( 6 ) , which is column  ( 4 ) minus column  ( 5 ) .",
    "the literature source is in column  ( 7 ) .",
    "the resulting p - l relations , calculated from the @xmath50 and @xmath53 values in table  [ tab:01 ] , are shown in figure  [ fig:04 ] .",
    "the slopes for the ngc3351/ ngc4321 combination and the galaxy are the steepest of those shown , and are similar .",
    "that of the lmc is next steepest .",
    "the slope of the galaxy p - l relation in @xcite and @xcite is based on averaging the results using the moving atmosphere method ( the baade - becker - wesselink procedure ) and the independent main sequence fitting method .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting slope of the p - l slope has been questioned as being too steep ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the slopes of the ngc3351 and ngc4321 combined p - l relation , and that of m31 by @xcite are equally steep as for the galaxy",
    ". the m31 slope by @xcite has been redetermined by @xcite .",
    "the original slope by villardel and collaborators was based on @xmath54 values using the lmc p - c relation rather than the more correct higher metallicity p - c relation for the galaxy .",
    "the resulting @xmath54 values turns out to depend on period as a further complication . but even discounting the m31 case , the steep slope for ngc3351 and ngc4321 from @xcite ( their fig .",
    "2 ) , supports the galaxy slope that we derived in @xcite and its difference from the p - l slope in lmc .",
    "the strongest evidence for the difference as function of metallicity is the data for ngc3109 @xcite which has the well determined p - l slope of @xmath55 .",
    "this differs significantly from the slopes of either the galaxy or ngc3351/ ngc4321 at @xmath56 , or @xmath57 for m31 , and even for the lmc at @xmath58 .",
    "the six longest period cepheids in ngc3109 with @xmath59 are too faint by @xmath60 ( fig .  4 of @xcite ) compared with either the galaxy or the lmc p - l relations .",
    "figure  [ fig:04 ] , similar in principle to figure  5 in @xcite , together with figure  [ fig:03 ] here , is our chief case for non - unique p - l relations between galaxies of different chemical compositions .",
    "the complications that this portends for determining the scale of extragalactic distances from cepheids to within @xmath61 , unless special corrections for the difference are applied , is discussed elsewhere ( cf . @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bernd reindl for his skill in the preparation of the diagrams and the text for publication .",
    "we also thank john grula , carnegie editorial chief , for his liaison with the press .",
