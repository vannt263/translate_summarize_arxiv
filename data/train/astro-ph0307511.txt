    "the hh  80 - 81 system , also known as ggd  27 ( gyulbudaghian et al .",
    "1978 ) , consists of a highly collimated radio jet that powers an outflow with a total projected extent of 5.3 pc , at an adopted distance of 1.7 kpc ( rodrguez  et al . 1980 ; mart , rodrguez , & reipurth 1993 ; 1995 ; 1998 ) .",
    "the thermal radio jet associated with hh  80 - 81 terminates to the south in the extremely bright optical hh objects 80 and 81 ( reipurth & graham 1988 ; mart , rodrguez , & reipurth 1993 , 1995 ; heathcote , reipurth , & raga 1998 ) and to the north in the radio source hh  80 north ( mart  1993 ; girart et al .  1994 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the central radio continuum source has a bright far - infrared counterpart , iras  18162@xmath102048 , which implies the presence of a luminous ( @xmath6 2 @xmath11  l@xmath12 ) young star or cluster of stars ( aspin & geballe 1992 ) .",
    "water maser emission has been reported in the vicinity of the central radio continuum source ( rodrguez  1978 ; 1980 ) .",
    "the h@xmath8o masers do not coincide with the jet core , suggesting that they are being powered by a different star ( gmez , rodrguez , & mart  1995 ; mart , rodrguez , & torrelles 1999 ) .",
    "methanol emission at 95 ghz has been reported by valtts et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to the northeast of the exciting source of the jet at the position of @xmath13(2000)= 18@xmath14 19@xmath15 12@xmath1689 ; @xmath17(2000)= @xmath1020@xmath18 47@xmath9 13@xmath196 with a positional error of 10@xmath7 .",
    "these methanol masers are classified as class  i which are believed to trace high - mass protostars that have not significantly ionized their environment .",
    "the most remarkable characteristic of the hh  80 - 81 system is the high degree of collimation of the jet , with an opening angle of @xmath61@xmath18 ( mart , rodrguez , & reipurth 1993 ) . collimated outflows and accretion disks are thought to be present at the same evolutionary stage in the formation of both low - mass and high - mass stars ( e.g. garay & lizano 1999 ; kurtz 2000 ) .",
    "an accretion disk around the central star is believed to be responsible for the ejection and collimation of the gas .",
    "in contrast with low - mass stars , where disk structures have been observed commonly around young objects ( beckwith & sargent 1996 ; wilner , ho , & rodrguez 1996 ; rodrguez , et al . 1998 ; wilner et al .",
    "2000 ) , in high - mass stars it has been difficult to establish the presence of accretion disks . whether the massive protostars are formed by accretion ( as it is the case for low mass stars ) or by merging of protostellar condensations ( bonnell & bate 2002 ) remains controversial .",
    "it has been argued , for example , that the ionizing flux present in massive stars could rapidly disrupt the disk .",
    "however , the presence of well collimated outflows in a few objects also points to the presence of accretion disks surrounding massive stars .",
    "if massive ob stars are formed by accretion , we expect that disks and jets will be present in their earliest stages of evolution , as in the case of low mass stars .",
    "accretion disks and collimated outflows around b - type protostars have been tentatively reported toward cepheus a hw2 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1994 ; torrelles et al . 1996 ) , iras 20126 + 4104 ( cesaroni et al .",

    "2002 ) and afgl  2591 ( trinidad et al .",
    "2003 ) . a possible collimated outflow associated with a luminous o - type protostar is iras  16547@xmath104247 , a bright infrared source that is associated with a triple radio source consisting of a compact central object and two outer lobes ( garay et al . 2003 ) .",
    "there is , however , no known unquestionable case of a circumstellar disk associated with a massive o - type protostar .",
    "the luminosity of hh  80 - 81 is @xmath62@xmath2010@xmath21 l@xmath4 , equivalent to that of a b0 zams star .",
    "since hh  80 - 81 possesses an extraordinary well collimated jet , it seems reasonable to propose that it should be originating from an accretion disk .",
    "however , until now there has been no clear evidence for the existence of this disk . a bipolar co outflow has been detected and mapped in the direction of hh  80 - 81 by yamashita  et al .",
    "( 1989 ) which spatially coincides with the infrared reflection nebula in the region .",
    "dense molecular gas traced by nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission was reported by torrelles et al .",
    "( 1986 ) from single dish observations , whereas girart et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported the detection of ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion transitions of ammonia downstream in hh  80 north .",
    "also a cs molecular clump has been observed towards the exciting source of hh  80 - 81 which exhibits an elongated structure ( @xmath660 @xmath20 25@xmath7 ) perpendicular to the co molecular outflow , that has been interpreted as a molecular disk ( yamashita  et al .",
    "however , high angular resolution observations are needed in order to establish the existence of a more compact circumstellar disk .",
    "we consider hh 80 - 81 as one of the best candidates for the detection of a protoplanetary disk using molecular lines .",
    "accordingly , the main goal of this work was to make observations , in several molecular lines and with adequate angular resolution , towards the core of hh  80 - 81 to search for an accretion disk that could account for the collimated outflow .",
    "the 1.3 cm line and continuum observations were made on 1999 april 12 with the very large array ( vla ) of the nrao  .",
    "the array was in the d configuration giving an angular resolution of 4@xmath7 at 1.3  cm .",
    "structures larger than 60@xmath7 were undetectable .",
    "we observed the ( j , k)=(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion transitions of the ammonia molecule in the spectral line mode towards the core of the hh  80 - 81 complex .",
    "we assumed rest frequencies of 23694.496 and 23722.633 mhz for the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "we used a bandpass of 3.125 mhz , centered at an lsr velocity of 10 km  s@xmath22 and 63 spectral channels 48.8 khz wide each ( @xmath6 0.6  km  s@xmath22 at the observing frequencies ) plus a continuum channel containing the central 75@xmath23 of the total band .",
    "flux densities were bootstrapped from observations of 1331 + 305 , which was assumed to have a flux density of 2.4 jy at 1.3 cm .",
    "the bandpass calibrator was 1229 + 020 with a flux density of 28.6 jy and the phase calibrator was 1733 - 130 with a flux density of 3.8 jy at 1.3 cm .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated in the standard manner using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) developed by the nrao .",
    "all spectra were hanning smoothed to a velocity resolution of 1.2 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath24 noise levels in a single spectral channel , after hanning smoothing , were 2.5 and 2.2 mjy beam@xmath22 ( corresponding to 0.38 and 0.33  k ) for the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations , respectively .",
    "the system temperature during observations was in the order of 150  k. we applied a primary beam correction ( with the task pbcor of aips ) to the ammonia data in order to have a good estimate of the flux for the emission that is displaced from the phase center .",
    "the observations were carried out in 1999 september 27 at 3.5  mm and 2001 may 6 at 1.4  mm with the 10-antenna bima array in the c configuration .",
    "the phase calibrator used was 1733 - 130 .",
    "absolute flux calibration was performed by observing mars .",
    "system temperatures were in the 200400  k range at 3.5  mm and in the 1600 - 4000  k range at 1.4  mm .",
    "the 3.5  mm frequency setup included the hco@xmath1 10 and hcn 10 lines , whereas the 1.4  mm setup included the so 5@xmath24@xmath3 and h@xmath8co 3@xmath252@xmath26 lines .",
    "self - calibration was performed in the 1.4  mm data by using the continuum emission .",
    "maps were made with the @xmath27 data weighted by the associated system temperatures .",
    "more details of the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "using the vla we detected an unresolved ( @xmath28 ) 1.3 cm continuum source coincident in position with the exciting source of the thermal jet .",
    "the estimated flux density at 1.3  cm is 6 @xmath29 1  mjy .",
    "this is consistent with the value reported by mart , rodrguez & torrelles ( 1999 ) .",
    "the 7 mm flux density was obtained from data taken with the vla on 1994 april 15 . the unresolved ( @xmath30 ) 7  mm source",
    "is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the continuum images at 3.5 and 1.4  mm made with bima are shown on figure  2 . to discuss the nature of this emission we present in figure 3 the continuum spectrum towards the exciting source of the thermal jet at cm and mm wavelengths .",
    "the 20 , 6 , and 2 cm flux densities are taken from mart  et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , while the 1.3 cm data point is that presented above from our vla observations .",
    "the flux densities at 7 , 3.5 and 1.4  mm toward the exciting source of the outflow are listed in table 2 . from figure 3",
    "we can see that the cm emission shows the characteristic flat spectrum of nearly optically thin free - free emission ( s@xmath31 ) , but that at 7 mm and shorter wavelengths , the flux density rises rapidly .",
    "this spectrum suggests that the flux densities at 3.5 and 1.4  mm are completely dominated by the dust ( at 3.5  mm the expected contribution from the thermal jet is only @xmath60.01 jy ) . the spectral index derived from the 7 , 3.5 and 1.4",
    "mm fluxes is 2.6 , consistent with optically - thin dust emission .",
    "there is also 1.4  mm emission associated with the c ammonia component ( see figure  2 , and table  3 ) .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) main inversion transitions of ammonia were strongly detected in emission toward the northeast of the jet , but only very weak ( 2,2 ) emission was observed at the position of the exciting source of the thermal jet .    figure  4 shows the velocity - integrated ammonia ( 1,1 ) emission toward hh  80 - 81 .",
    "we identify three main ammonia structures ; the bright , c component which exhibits an extended structure and peaks close to the position of the water masers in the region , a small ammonia clump to the northeast of the c component ( hereinafter called the ne component ) and the s component which is located @xmath61@xmath9 to the south of the c component .",
    "figure  5 shows the channel maps of the nh@xmath0  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emissions toward the surroundings of the exciting source of hh  80 - 81 . in general ,",
    "the ammonia emission from the molecular cloud in both transitions appears distributed to the northeast of the thermal jet , spanning over the same velocity range , from @xmath6 10 to 14 km  s@xmath22 . as noted before",
    ", the peak emission of the c ammonia component is nearly coincident with the position of the h@xmath8o maser spots ( gmez , mart , & rodrguez 1995 ; mart , rodrguez & torrelles 1999 ) .",
    "figure  6 presents a close - up of the velocity - integrated emission in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) ammonia lines from the c component and the ( 1,1 ) line from the s component .",
    "the top panel also shows the ( 1,1 ) ammonia emission from the ne ammonia clump where methanol maser emission has been reported ( valtts et al .",
    "the s component was detected only in the ( 1,1 ) ammonia transition and in the velocity range from 11.9 to 13.7 km  s@xmath22 , suggesting it corresponds to a cold molecular clump .",
    "the spectra of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion transitions from each individual ammonia component ( integrated over their whole area of emission ) are presented in figure  7 .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) main and satellite lines were detected toward each individual ammonia component , while in the ( 2,2 ) ammonia transition emission was detected only in the main line and toward the c and ne components . in table  3",
    "we list the ammonia parameters of the main and satellite ammonia lines from the c , ne and s components determined by fitting a gaussian profile to the corresponding spectrum .",
    "the peak intensity of these three ammonia components are around the lsr velocity of + 12 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "figure 8 shows line profiles and maps of the so 5@xmath24@xmath3 , hco@xmath1 10 and hcn 10 emission .",
    "the so emission arises from a compact region around the thermal jet .",
    "a gaussian fit to the so profile gives a peak flux density of 7.6 @xmath29 1.6  jy , a central velocity of v@xmath32= 12.1 @xmath29 0.2 km  s@xmath22 and a linewidth of @xmath33v= 1.3 @xmath29 0.4 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "this is the first time that so emission is detected toward the exciting source of hh 80 - 81 and suggests that this transition may be a good tracer of molecular gas near massive protostars .",
    "the hco@xmath1 and hcn emissions trace basically the same spatial region as the ammonia central component and in a similar velocity range .",
    "weak hco@xmath1 emission is observed toward the ne ammonia clump , confirming its existence .",
    "there is some enhancement of the hco@xmath1 and hcn emission toward the direction of the thermal radio jet , but it is difficult to separate the molecular gas arising from the jet region from the more extended central component . despite the similitude of the hco@xmath1 and hcn integrated maps with the integrated ammonia maps , the observed hco@xmath1 and hcn spectra show a clear self - absorption feature at the center of their lines ( see fig .  8) , which is not observed in the ammonia lines .",
    "it is possibly a true self - absorption since the shortest baselines also show this absorption feature .",
    "we also searched for emission in the h@xmath8co 3@xmath252@xmath26 line toward the region .",
    "the integrated velocity spectrum in a velocity range from 10 to 14 km  s@xmath22 did not show emission at a 3-@xmath34 level of @xmath62 jy  beam@xmath22 .",
    "the line data presented here reveal the presence of three main molecular structures that we called the c , the ne , and the s components . in what follows",
    "we discuss each of these components and derive their bulk physical parameters , and conclude with a discussion of the molecular and dust emission toward the surroundings of the jet .",
    "this large structure of molecular gas has a peak position located about 8@xmath7 northeast from the exciting source of the thermal jet .",
    "emission toward this component was detected in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions of nh@xmath0 , and hcn ( 10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( 10 ) lines , indicating the presence of considerable amounts of cold molecular gas .",
