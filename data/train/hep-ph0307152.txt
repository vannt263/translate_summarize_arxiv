    "rare decay modes of the @xmath11 meson are important places to test the standard model ( sm ) and to look for new physics",

    "nevertheless , cp asymmetries of neutral @xmath11 meson decays into final cp eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are uniquely clean in their theoretical interpretations . among these decay modes , @xmath14",

    "in addition , the branching ratios ( brs ) and the direct cp asymmetries of both the charged and neutral modes of @xmath0 have also been measured @xcite$ ] only includes babar and belle since cleo @xcite is @xmath25 away .",

    "in particular , the relatively small uncertainties in the brs of @xmath28 and @xmath14 need to be considered in the analysis since they are highly correlated and both are based on the @xmath29 transition . in the sm , @xmath30 is small and agrees with ( [ eq01b ] ) .",
    "so this direct cp asymmetry result plays an important role in constraining the new physics contribution which might explain the discrepancy between @xmath2 and @xmath9 .    the discrepancy between @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath9 has been discussed in some recent works @xcite in the framework of susy models , especially in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with the mass insertion method @xcite .",
    "although these works can provide useful constraints on certain off - diagonal terms of squark mass matrices at low energy , we find that it is very interesting to investigate this problem in the context of grand unified theory ( gut ) models .",
    "since gut models explain a number of phenomena at low energy by a few well motivated parameters at the gut scale , various experimental measurements get correlated in this framework . among supersymmetric gut models ,",
    "the r - parity conserved sugra model is one of the most favored models since it provides a natural explanation of the dark matter problem .",
    "the minimal sugra model ( msugra ) with r - parity conservation has been investigated extensively because of its predictive power that comes from the fact that it depends on only a few new parameters . unlike the mssm , which is hard to be constrained due to its more than 100 new parameters ( including 43 cp violating phases ) , the parameter space of the minimum sugra model has 4 parameters and 4 phases .",
    "this parameter space has several experimental constraints , i.e. @xmath31 , neutron and electron electric dipole moments ( edm ) , lep bounds and relic density measurements@xcite etc .. in this paper , we examine the observed discrepancy between @xmath2 and @xmath9 in the context of sugra models including msugra and models with non - universalities .",
    "we consider all relevant experimental constraints in our calculation .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 decays involve the evaluation of the matrix elements of related operators in the effective hamiltonian , which is the most difficult part in this calculation .",
    "however , the newly developed qcd improved factorization ( bbns approach ) @xcite provides a systematic way to calculate the matrix elements of a large class of @xmath11 decays with significant improvements over the old factorization approach ( naive factorization ) .",
    "it allows a qcd calculation of `` non - factorizable '' contributions and model independent predictions for strong phases which are important in the theoretical evaluation of the direct cp asymmetries of @xmath11 decays , e.g. for @xmath32 , whose experimental result is given in ( [ eq01b ] ) .",
    "we adopt the qcd improved factorization in our @xmath0 calculations .",
    "recently du et al .",
    "@xcite have published an improved calculation of @xmath33 decays .",
    "we followed here their calculational techniques @xcite which are based on the original work @xcite of beneke , et al . while the bbns approach is an important advance in calculating @xmath11 decays , it is not completely model independent . in the bbns approach",
    "the hard gluon ( h ) and annihilation ( a ) diagrams ( see fig.[feyn ] ) contain infrared divergences which are parameterized by an amplitude @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) and a phase @xmath36 .",

    "if the effects of these terms are small , the theoretical predictions are well defined . however , if these terms are large or dominant , the theory becomes suspect .",

    "although non - universalities may cause serious problems in some flavor changing processes , e.g. @xmath42 mixing and @xmath43 , we will show that the off - diagonal terms in the a parameter soft - breaking terms can satisfy all experimental data including the @xmath8 deviation between @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",

    "we also notice that when non - universal terms are present , new annihilation channels may arise and they are different from the usual msugra @xmath99 co - annihilation channel .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath100 mixing can significantly constrain certain flavor changing sources in susy models @xcite .",

    "however , in this region the weak annihilation diagrams dominate the branching ratio and thus the theory is most suspect . in the remaining part of the parameter space , where the weak annihilation effects are small and",
    "the theory is presumably reliable , the sm prediction of the branching ratio is small , about @xmath10 below the experimental value .",
    "we conclude therefore that where the theory is reliable the sm is in significant disagreement with the experimental value of the @xmath143 $ ] , and in order to obtain a sm value in accord with the experiment one must use parameters where the theory is least reliable .",
    "a similar result holds for the @xmath144 $ ] . here",
    "theory predicts a branching ratio about 10% smaller than for @xmath145 ( in accord with the experimental values of eq.([eq01a ] ) ) but the sm can achieve this only in the region where the weak annihilation processes dominate .",
    "the dot - dashed line , in fig.[phi ] , corresponds to a larger value of @xmath110 and we see that the br is very sensitive to @xmath110 only in the large annihilation region .",
    "the region with sufficiently large annihilation to accommodate the data decreases as @xmath110 increases , since the annihilation amplitude then decreases , as can be seen from eq.([eq13a ] ) .",
    "before we proceed to present our results , let us first mention the values of the parameters used in our calculation of @xmath0 decay amplitudes in sugra models since the brs depend sensitively on them .",
    "we use @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and a ckm fit giving @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "( if we increase @xmath151 , the br decreases , e.g. for @xmath152 , the sm br decreases by @xmath153% . )",

    "[ ms1 ] , we give the numerical results for two different values of the msugra parameter @xmath156 cases i.e. @xmath157 and 10 and for different @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the small weak annihilation case . for simplicity , we set @xmath158 in the calculation of table i. we use large phases for other parameters but still satisfy the edm constrains .",
    "for example , for @xmath159 gev and @xmath160 gev with @xmath161 , we find that @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( at the weak scale ) satisfy the edm constraints ( for reasons discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "the phase @xmath165 has a very small effect on @xmath2 and this effect becomes smaller as the magnitude of @xmath79 decreases .",
    "thus a different value of @xmath165 , in the above fit , can change @xmath2 by @xmath166 for @xmath160 gev .",
    "this change is even smaller for smaller @xmath77 , e.g. for @xmath167 gev , the change in @xmath2 is less than @xmath168% .",
    "so far we have not specified @xmath75 for our results .",
    "the values of @xmath75 , for different @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are chosen such that the relic density constraint is satisfied .",
    "we also satisfy the @xmath169 $ ] constraint and the higgs mass constraint .",
    "the @xmath2 values shown in the table are the minimum that can be reached for given @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "it can be seen from table i that the @xmath2 values in msugra differ only slightly from the sm prediction which is @xmath170 evaluated using just the ckm phase .",
    "the branching ratios of @xmath0 decays also do not differ much from the sm prediction .",
    "even if one went to the large weak annihilation region to accommodate the large branching ratios , @xmath2 would still be similar to the numbers in table i. therefore , msugra can not explain the large br and the 2.7@xmath171 difference between the @xmath2 and the @xmath18 experimental results .",
    "the reason is that , in msugra , the only flavor violating source is in the ckm matrix , which can not provide enough flavor violation needed for the @xmath29 transition in @xmath0 decays . in the next section , we will search for the minimal extension of msugra that can solve both the br and cp problems of @xmath0 decays .    .@xmath2 with small weak annihilation at @xmath172 and 40 in msugra .",
    "the values are the minimum that can be reached subject to all other experimental constraints[ms1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section we discuss the case @xmath173 but @xmath174 .",
    "the phases used are similar to those used in first two cases except @xmath175 .",
    "this case is more complicated than the @xmath176 case .",
    "we find that it is easier to start by comparing them .",
    "the first important change is that the @xmath177 contribution is much smaller than the @xmath178 contribution to the mixing between the second and the third generation in the down squark mass matrix due to the suppression by the second generation yukawa coupling in the rge of @xmath179 .",
    "( thus our choice of @xmath175 has no loss of generality . )",
    "consequently , the size of the wilson coefficient @xmath180 is significantly reduced .",
    "although @xmath181 still contributes , that contribution is also reduced ( compared to @xmath182 ) due to the rge .",
    "therefore , compared with the first case the total susy contributions are reduced especially for @xmath183 and thus it becomes harder to fit the experimental results .    another important change is the roles of some experimental constraints which are not important in the first case in the sense that they do not prevent the susy contributions from increasing , or at least their limits are not reached when we have solutions satisfying the b - decay data .",
    "below are some comments concerning this :    \\1 . for @xmath161 and low @xmath76 , i.e. 300 gev , the @xmath93 $ ] will constrain the size of @xmath184 .",
    "this is why the @xmath2 and the branching ratio fit is not as good as the corresponding one shown in table [ da1 ] for the @xmath176 case .",
    "when @xmath76 increases , the size of @xmath184 also needs to be increased .",
    "but three other additional constraints are present , i.e @xmath101 and @xmath185 from the @xmath100 mixing and the mass of smallest up squarks ( right - handed stop ) @xmath186 .",
    "for example , for @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( and @xmath189 gev by the relic density constraint ) we get @xmath190 gev ( where @xmath191 is the average squark mass and @xmath192 is the mass of the gluino , see @xcite for more details ) and we find that @xmath193 and @xmath194 which are allowed by the experimental bounds on @xmath101 and @xmath185 @xcite ( the sizes of @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 are around @xmath198 and thus these bounds can be safely ignored in our case ) .",
    "the situation for the right - handed stop mass is similar to the pseudoscalar higgs case we mentioned at the end of case i. we use the @xmath199 channel to satisfy the dark matter constraints . although it s possible to use a larger @xmath200 which consequently reduces @xmath186 more and then opens the @xmath201 channel , the room is small due to the smallness of @xmath202 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath203 and the @xmath185 bounds become harder to satisfy when @xmath186 is small . therefore , as in the case where the pseudoscalar higgs mass becomes small",
    ", possible improvements can not satisfy the experimental results of both @xmath2 and @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "a further difference is the @xmath156 dependence . in case i ,",
    "as was discussed above , gluino contributions depend inversely on @xmath156 due to the way that @xmath204 enters into the down squark mass matrix .",
    "but in this case , the gluino contributions are reduced significantly and the chargino plays a more important role , which will be enhanced by @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , in this case , we see that larger @xmath156 can satisfy the experimental results at small @xmath76 , but small @xmath156 can not and that is why we have only given results in table [ ua2 ] for two values of @xmath76 at @xmath183 since higher @xmath76 can not improve the situation .",
    "we also comment concerning @xmath77 and its phase .",
    "so far , we have used the phase @xmath142 for @xmath77 .",
    "we find that using a different phase will not improve the results greatly .",
    "in general , the improvement is at a few percent level .",
    "( this holds also for case i. ) for example , in case ii , for @xmath161 , @xmath205 and @xmath160 , we find that using @xmath206 can improve @xmath2 from -0.04 to -0.06 .    finally we note that the values of @xmath207 and @xmath4 remain small , i.e. @xmath207 and @xmath4 are @xmath208 and @xmath209 at @xmath172 , and @xmath210 and @xmath209 at @xmath157 .",
    "in this paper , we have probed the @xmath0 decays in sugra models with cp violating phases to explain the discrepancy between the experimental measurements and the sm predictions of the cp asymmetry of @xmath14 and the branching ratios of the @xmath0 decays .",
    "we have calculated the cp asymmetries of @xmath32 and @xmath1 . in our analysis",
    ", we implemented all relevant experimental constraints , e.g. @xmath93 $ ] , relic density , @xmath42 mixing parameters and electron and neutron edms .",
    "we used the improved qcd factorization method @xcite for the calculation of decay amplitudes .",
    "the sm not only can not explain the cp asymmetry of @xmath14 , it also fails to satisfy the @xmath7 $ ] data barring the region of large weak annihilation where the theory is most suspect .",
    "we then studied the msugra model and found that it also has the same problem . therefore ,",
    "if the current experimental results continue to hold in the future , it will signal the first significant breakdown of the standard model and also of msugra .",
    "this conclusion is important in the sense that one needs to construct a more complicated sugra model to satisfy experimental measurements which will provide important guidance to our future research on susy models and their signals at the accelerator experiments .",
    "we have considered the extension of the msugra model by adding non - universal a terms . for a gut theory ,",
    "the only natural choice is to have a left - right mixing between the second and the third generation in the up or down quark sectors i.e. @xmath211 and @xmath212 terms .",
    "we have examined thoroughly several different possibilities in this extension and their theoretical predictions and have found a large region of parameter space where all experimental results can be satisfied , including the cp asymmetries and branching ratios of the @xmath0 decays . this result",
    "is obtained without resorting to large weak annihilation amplitudes and so is based on reliable calculations of hadronic decays , and thus provides useful hints for the study of hadronic b decays .",
    "further the size of @xmath213 needed is the same as the other soft breaking terms , and so is not anomalously small or large .",
    "thus , this study also can provide important phenomenological information not only for accelerator physics but also for building models at the gut scale and for exploring physics beyond it . in this connection , models based on horava - witten m - theory can naturally give rise to non - zero values of @xmath214 . in previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown that it was possible to construct a three generation model with @xmath215 symmetry using a non - standard embedding based on a torus fibered calabi - yau three fold with a del pezzo base @xmath216 .",
    "the model allowed wilson line breaking to the standard model at @xmath81 , and also had vanishing instanton charges on the physical orbifold plane .",
    "if in addition one assumed that the 5-branes in the bulk clustered around the distant plane , one could explain without undue fine tuning the general structure of the quark and lepton mass hierarchies and obtain the lma solution for neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "one can show that the model naturally gives rise to @xmath214 non - universal terms as required by the current b - factory data , while keeping the squark mass matrices essentially universal .",
    "this model will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
