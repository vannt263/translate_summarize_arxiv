    "the measurement of longitudinal spin asymmetries in production of @xmath0 bosons at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) will provide an essential probe for spin - dependent quark distributions at high momentum scales @xmath4 @xcite . at a @xmath5 center - of - mass energy @xmath6 gev ,",
    "about @xmath7 @xmath8and @xmath9 bosons will be produced by the time the integrated luminosity reaches @xmath10 . due to the parity violation in the @xmath11 coupling , this process permits non - vanishing single - spin asymmetries @xmath12 , defined for any kinematical variable @xmath13 as@xmath14 the born - level expression for the asymmetry @xmath15 with respect to the rapidity @xmath16 of the @xmath1 boson is particularly simple if the absolute value of @xmath16 is large . in that case",
    ", the born - level @xmath15 reduces to the ratio @xmath17 of the polarized and unpolarized parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 tests the flavor dependence of quark polarizations .",
    "the original method for extracting the spin - dependent quark distributions out of the rhic @xmath1 boson data is based on the direct reconstruction of the asymmetry @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such reconstruction is obstructed by specifics of the detection of @xmath0 bosons at rhic .",
    "first , neither @xcite nor @xcite detector at rhic is hermetic .",
    "therefore , it is not possible at those detectors to monitor the energy balance in particle reactions , even in the transverse direction with respect to the beams . due to the lack of information about the missing energy carried by the neutrino , the determination of @xmath16 is in general ambiguous and depends on the assumptions about the dynamics of the process .",
    "second , due to the correlation between the spins of the initial - state quarks and final - state leptons , the measured value of @xmath15 is strongly sensitive to the experimental cuts imposed on the observed charged lepton .",
    "hence , unless a theory calculation exists to reliably predict the distributions of the leptons from the @xmath1 boson decay , the spin - dependent quark distribution functions can not be determined with acceptable accuracy .    in weak boson production at the fermilab tevatron @xmath18 collider ,",
    "the mass @xmath19 of the @xmath1 boson has been measured to a great precision @xcite .",
    "the information on @xmath19 is extracted out of the lepton - level distributions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the transverse momenta of the electron and neutrino , and @xmath25 is the transverse mass of the lepton pair . the value of @xmath19 can be determined from the analysis of the position and shape of the jacobian peaks in each of these three distributions . for most of the events contributing near the jacobian peak , the transverse momentum @xmath26 of the @xmath1 boson is very small , of order of a few gev .",
    "therefore , at each order of the perturbative qcd calculation , there are large logarithmic contributions of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these large logarithmic contributions can be summed to all orders in @xmath30 by applying the transverse momentum resummation formalism formulated in the impact parameter space by collins , soper , and sterman ( css ) @xcite .",
    "without such a resummation calculation performed at the decay lepton level @xcite , it would not be possible to determine @xmath19 from the experimental data .",
    "this is because at hadron colliders the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino from the @xmath1 boson decay is not observed by the detectors ; hence , the invariant mass of the @xmath1 boson can not be measured directly . instead , the determination of the @xmath1 boson mass relies on the analysis of the shape of the jacobian peaks in the lepton - level distributions sensitive to @xmath26 .",
    "again , without a resummation calculation at the secondary lepton level , it would not be possible to predict the shape of these distributions accurately enough to determine @xmath19 .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the phenomenology of the @xmath1 boson physics at the tevatron collider .    similarly , at rhic",
    ", a resummation calculation is needed to reliably predict the distribution of the secondary leptons from the @xmath1 boson decay .",
    "as we already mentioned , the reason is the necessity to deduce spin - dependent parton luminosities based on the observation of the secondary charged lepton only . for rhic purposes ,",
    "the resummation calculation at the lepton level has to be modified to include the spin dependence , which has been performed in ref .",

    "we will argue that these directly observed asymmetries provide a viable alternative to the commonly discussed asymmetry @xmath15 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formalismoutline ] , we briefly summarize the resummation formalism used for this study .",
    "a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation is also presented for comparison to the resummation calculation . since good understanding of spin - averaged cross sections",
    "is needed to derive polarized pdfs from the spin asymmetries , section  [ sec : unpolarized ] discusses the uncertainties due to the imperfect knowledge of unpolarized parton distributions , as well as the potential for rhic experiments to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "section  [ sec : reconstruction - of - spin ] demonstrates that a correct model of multiple parton radiation is important to describe the differential distributions of the final - state leptons .",
    "we then employ the resummation calculation to realistically evaluate the feasibility of the reconstruction of the asymmetry @xmath15 from the observed charged lepton data .",
    "section  [ sec : lepton - level - asymmetries ] shows that the spin asymmetries for the distributions of the observed secondary leptons provide an attractive alternative to the asymmetry @xmath15 : they can be measured directly and discriminate efficiently between the different pdf sets .",
    "we also show that the rhic experiments can explore the spin dependence of the nonperturbative contributions from the multiple parton radiation .",
    "the main findings of this paper are recapped in the conclusion .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to discuss production of @xmath0 bosons , which will be used at rhic to obtain information about the longitudinally polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the quark sector . due to the unique feature of the maximal parity violation in the @xmath35 coupling ,",
    "the parton - level cross sections for spin - dependent @xmath1 boson production have pronounced single - spin asymmetries .",
    "this feature gives @xmath1 boson production an edge on parity - conserving processes , in which non - trivial hadronic dynamics can be probed only through the measurement of more complex double - spin asymmetries .",

    "rhicbos reads in the cross section grids , performs their multi - dimensional integration , and produces the output that is optimized for rhic specifics . since the finite - order cross section is characterized by a smaller theoretical uncertainty at @xmath57 , rhicbos switches from the resummed cross section ( @xmath58 ) to the finite - order cross section at the point where the resummation cross section becomes smaller than the finite - order cross section at @xmath26 above the position of the maximum in @xmath59 . to compare the resummation calculation to the finite - order approach",

    "the goal of this section is to argue that at present the uncertainties in the unpolarized cross sections at rhic are sizeable ; to reliably predict the unpolarized rate , these uncertainties must be reduced by dedicated rhic measurements .",

    ", it may not be possible to distinguish between the positively and negatively charged leptons from the @xmath1 boson decay , particularly before the solenoid field of the detector is fully operational .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the possibility of measuring the single - spin asymmetries in the combined sample of @xmath197 and @xmath9 bosons , without distinguishing between charged leptons and anti - leptons .",
    "such asymmetries are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : alyl_wpwm ] and [ fig : alptl_wpwm ] .",
    "since there are about three @xmath8 bosons produced per each @xmath9 boson , these asymmetries are close to the @xmath8 boson asymmetries shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : alyl_wp ] and [ fig : alyl_wm ] .",
    "therefore , these asymmetries will be able to distinguish between different pdf sets for a sufficiently high number of events . and",
    "[ fig : alptl_wpwm ] ( evaluated for @xmath79 ) will have to be adjusted to agree with the actual integrated luminosity at the time of the measurement .",
    "] however , they can not completely replace the single - spin asymmetries for independent @xmath8 and @xmath9 boson samples , which have better discriminating power and allow us to distinguish between contributions of different parton flavors .",
    "as was discussed above , the transverse momentum distributions for vector bosons are affected by the soft and collinear radiation , which can be described only by means of all - order resummation .",
    "in addition , the distributions at very small @xmath26 are sensitive to nonperturbative contributions characterized by large impact parameters @xmath198 . as a result",
    ", the shape of the lepton - level distribution @xmath123 around its peak at about @xmath124 is affected by both perturbative and nonperturbative qcd radiation , in addition to the nonzero width of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "while the perturbative soft and collinear contributions can be calculated order - by - order in the resummation formalism , the nonperturbative contributions ( associated with the nonperturbative transverse motion of partons inside the proton ) can only be approximated by phenomenological parametrizations .",
    "in particular , based on the factorization properties of the resummed cross sections , one can hypothesize a simple relationship between the nonperturbative sudakov factors in the unpolarized , single - spin , and double - spin vector boson production:@xmath199 furthermore , @xmath200 is usually assumed to be independent of the type of the electroweak hard probe , so that it is the same in @xmath53 @xmath201 and @xmath99 boson production .",
    "if the relationship ( [ snpcrossing ] ) for the spin dependence of @xmath200 indeed holds in nature , the nonperturbative contributions in single - spin @xmath1 boson production can be determined unambiguously once the parametrizations of @xmath200 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ snpcrossing ] ) are available , e.g. , from the global analysis of the distributions @xmath59 in the unpolarized and double - spin @xmath202 or @xmath3 production .",
    "it is well known from the unpolarized studies ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the importance of the nonperturbative contributions in the massive boson production at high - energy colliders is strongly reduced as compared to drell - yan pair production in fixed - target experiments . nonetheless , this dependence is not entirely negligible at small transverse momenta of @xmath1 bosons , roughly for @xmath203 gev or less .",
    "to give an idea about the typical size of the nonperturbative contributions , fig .",
    "[ fig : ptl ] shows the event rate for the single - spin cross section @xmath189 at @xmath79 , integrated over the acceptance range @xmath204 .",
    "this rate was calculated using two parameterizations @xcite of the nonperturbative part , which were found from the analysis of unpolarized vector boson production .",
    "correspondingly , the resummed cross sections were calculated with the assumption that @xmath205 .",
    "it can be seen that the sensitivity to the nonperturbative input is small , but , nonetheless , visible near the jacobian peak . for comparison",
    ", we also included the nlo cross section calculated using the phase space slicing method .",
    "the nlo curve substantially deviates from the resummation curves , and , moreover , its shape can be drastically modified by varying the phase space slicing parameter @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast , practically all features of the resummation curve are determined unambiguously by the perturbative contribution , and the remaining small dependence on the nonperturbative contributions is pinned down by utilizing a phenomenological parameterization discussed above .",
    "needless to say , rhic should explore the spin properties of nonperturbative contributions by studying distributions @xmath59 in the double - spin @xmath202 and @xmath3 production and @xmath123 in single - spin and double - spin @xmath1 boson production .",
    "due to the maximal parity violation in the weak current coupling , the longitudinal single - spin asymmetry of @xmath1 boson production is strongly sensitive to the polarized parton distributions . at the center - of - mass energy of 500 gev , @xmath1 boson production events at rhic",
    "can clearly discriminate between various polarized quark luminosities . as a @xmath5 collider , rhic probes the sea quark pdfs in the region of relatively high @xmath206 where such pdfs are not adequately constrained even in the unpolarized case .",
    "therefore , rhic experiments also have a good potential to reduce the uncertainties in the unpolarized sea quark pdfs in a dedicated study of spin - averaged cross sections .    since and detectors do not determine the missing transverse energy associated with the neutrino from @xmath1 boson decay , and because the charged leptons from the decay can only be observed in a part of the @xmath207 solid angle , the reconstruction of the asymmetries at the level of @xmath1 bosons is not easy to realize . as an alternative to the asymmetry @xmath15 for the @xmath1 boson rapidity distribution @xmath158 , we advocate the measurement of the asymmetries @xmath208 ) and @xmath32 for the distributions @xmath125 and @xmath123 in the rapidity @xmath33 and transverse momentum @xmath34 of the secondary charged lepton .",
    "these lepton - level asymmetries can be directly observed at rhic detectors , they are sizeable , and they can be used to determine the polarized pdfs with high precision .    to reliably predict the distributions of the charged leptons in all available phase space , a theoretical calculation is needed for all - order summation of large logarithmic contributions corresponding to @xmath1 bosons with a small transverse momentum . at the lepton level , the largest effect of the logarithm resummation",
    "is observed in the distributions @xmath123 and @xmath189 in the proximity of the jacobian peak ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "the importance of the resummation can be verified by observing a large difference between the resummed and nlo cross sections near the jacobian peak , which happens only when the effect of soft gluon radiation is important .    in this paper , we apply the state - of - art resummation calculation @xcite for spin - dependent vector boson production to predict reliably the distributions of the observed leptons from @xmath1 boson decay .",
    "in addition to the spin - averaged and single - spin cross sections , we presented a detailed study of single - spin asymmetries for the decay lepton in the presence of kinematical cuts imposed by and detectors .",
    "furthermore , we propose to study the distribution @xmath189 at @xmath209 to learn about the spin ( in)dependence of nonperturbative contributions in the css resummation formalism .",
    "the study of such contributions for different beam polarizations and bosons of different types ( @xmath53@xmath0 , @xmath3 ) will shed light on basic properties of qcd factorization and provide important clues about the nature of the intrinsic transverse motion of partons inside the proton .",
