    "blends of polymers and nanoparticles , commonly called `` polymer nanocomposites '' ( pnc ) , have garnered much attention due to the possibility of dramatic improvement of polymeric properties with the addition of a relatively small fraction of nanoparticles  @xcite . successfully making use of these materials",
    "depends upon a firm understanding of both their mechanical and flow properties .",
    "numerous computational and theoretical studies have examined the clustering and network formation of nanoparticles and their effect on both the structural and rheological properties of pncs  @xcite . the vast majority of these efforts have focused on nanoparticles that are either spherical , polyhedral or otherwise relatively symmetric , although there are some notable exceptions  @xcite . in contrast",
    ", experiments have tended to emphasize highly asymmetric nanoparticles  @xcite , such as layered silicates or carbon nanotubes .",
    "it is generally appreciated that these highly asymmetric nanoparticles have the potential to be even more effective than spherical ( or nearly spherical ) nanoparticles in changing the properties of the polymer matrix to which they are added .",
    "in addition to the large enhancements in viscosity and shear modulus expected from continuum hydrodynamic and elasticity theories , extended nanoparticles can more easily form network structures both through direct interaction between the nanoparticles , or through chain bridging between the nanoparticles  @xcite , where a `` bridging '' chain is a chain in contact with at least two different nanoparticles .",
    "these non - continuum mechanisms are believed to play a significant role in property enhancement , though the dominant mechanism depends on the properties considered , particle - polymer and particle - particle interactions , sample preparation , etc .",
    "given that the majority of previous computational efforts have focused on symmetric nanoparticles , we wish to elucidate the role of _ nanoparticle shape _ in determining basic material properties , such as the viscosity @xmath0 , and material `` strength '' , ( i.e. , breaking stress ) .",
    "computer simulations are well suited to examine the role of nanoparticle shape , since it is possible to probe the effects of changing the shape without the alteration of any of the intermolecular interactions . in this way",
    ", the changes due to nanoparticle shape can be isolated from other effects .",
    "such a task is complicated experimentally , since it is difficult to modify the shape of a nanoparticle without dramatically altering its intermolecular interactions . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the viscosity @xmath0 and ultimate isotropic tensile strength @xmath1 of model pnc systems with either ( i ) highly symmetric icosahedral nanoparticles ( compact particles ) , ( ii ) elongated rod - like nanoparticles , and ( iii ) sheet - like nanoparticles .",
    "these nanoparticles can be thought of as idealizations of common nanoparticles , such as gold nanoparticles and fullerenes ( polyhedral ) , nanotubes and fibers , and nanoclay and graphene sheet materials , respectively .",
    "our results are based on molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations , using non - equilibrium methods to evaluate @xmath0  @xcite , and exploiting the `` inherent structure '' formalism to determine @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we find that the rod - like nanoparticles give the largest enhancement to @xmath0 , which we correlate with the presence of chains that bridge between the nanoparticles .",
    "the sheet nanoparticles offer the weakest increase in @xmath0 , and correspondingly have the smallest fraction of bridging chains . for the ultimate isotropic strength @xmath1",
    ", we find opposite results : the sheets provide the greatest reinforcement , while the rods the least . for both of these properties , the property changes induced by the icosahedral nanoparticles fall between those of the extended nanoparticles .",
    "the present simulations are idealized mixtures of polymers and nanoparticles in which the polymer - nanoparticle interactions are highly favorable so as to promote nanoparticle dispersion .",
    "moreover , we have chosen to work at relatively high temperature in order to avoid contributions to @xmath0 from the complex physics of slowing dynamics approaching the glass transition .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown that polymer - surface interaction effects in this low temperature range can alter , and potentially dominate the nanocomposite properties .",
    "we also limit the range of chain length @xmath3 studied to avoid effects of significant polymer entanglement .",
    "these limitations on interaction , temperature , and chain length are advantageous in order to develop a clear understanding of the origin of the observed changes in properties .",
    "such a reference calculation provides a reference starting point to understand behavior when these constraints are relaxed . with this in mind , caution is needed when comparing these results with experimental data where these complicating additional factors may be present  along with other possible effects , such as crystallization or phase separation .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we describe the details of the model and method , focusing on the differences between the nanoparticle types used in each system .",
    "section  [ sec : composite_rheology ] describes our investigation of the rheological properties of the nanocomposites , while section  [ sec : isotropic_tensile_strength ] considers the effects of shape on @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to directly compare to experiments , it is desirable to use as realistic a molecular model as possible . while a chemically accurate md simulation is possible in principle , it is often more difficult to identify basic physical trends with such models .",
    "such attempts at chemical realism are also demanding in terms of the computational times required , which restricts the class of problems which can be investigated .",
    "coarse - grained models of polymeric materials provide a good compromise between the the opposing needs of realism and computational feasibility .",
    "such models can reproduce qualitative experimental trends of nanocomposites , but precise quantitative predictions can not be expected  @xcite . building on nanocomposite models introduced before  @xcite , we study a coarse - grained model for polymers  @xcite and nanoparticles that allow us to consider pnc systems over a wide range of physically interesting systems . here",
    "we consider several nanoparticle shapes built by connecting spherical force sites .",
    "we perform md simulations of systems consisting of a small fraction of model nanoparticles in a dense polymer melt . for reference",
    "we also simulate the corresponding pure polymer melt .",

    "we use three different types of nanoparticles for our calculations .",
    "[ fig : nanoparticles ] shows representative images of the nanoparticles .",
    "the first type of nanoparticle , an icosahedron , was previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite which focused on factors controlling nanoparticle dispersion and low temperature effects on transport for a similar polymer matrix , respectively .",
    "practical realizations include fullerene particles , primary carbon black particles , quantum dots , and metal nanoparticle additives .",
    "the nanoparticle force sites interact with each other via an identical @xmath18 given in eq .",
    "( [ equation : vlj ] ) , with @xmath12 . to maintain the icosahedral shape , the force site at each vertex",
    "is bonded to its 5 nearest neighbors via a harmonic spring potential @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 equals the minimum of the force - shifted lj potential , approximately @xmath22 . to further reinforce the icosahedral geometry ,",
    "a central particle is bonded to the vertices with the same potential eq .",
    "( [ equation : vharm ] ) with the same value of @xmath23 , but with a slightly smaller preferred bond length , @xmath24 , the radius of the sphere circumscribed around an icosahedron .",
    "the resulting nanoparticles have some flexibility , but are largely rigid , thereby preserving their icosahedral shape .",
    "the second type of nanoparticle is a semiflexible rod represented by 10 lj force sites with neighboring monomers bonded by the same @xmath25 as used for the polymers .",
    "we choose the shape to represent nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes or nanofibers .",
    "carbon nanotubes typically have lengths up to several @xmath26 m and a diameter of 1  nm to 2  nm ( single - walled tubes ) or 2  nm to 25  nm ( multiwalled tubes can have even larger diameters )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such large rods are not feasible to simulate , as the system size needed to avoid finite size effects exceeds current computational resources . as a compromise , we simulate rods with a length - to - diameter ratio of 10 .",
    "there is an additional bond potential between nanoparticle force sites @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between three consecutive force sites .",
    "this imparts stiffness to the rod .",
    "we choose @xmath29 , so that like the icosahedra , the rods have some flexibility , but are largely rigid .",
    "the third type of nanoparticle is square `` sheet '' comprised of 100 force sites . while the sheets are obviously different from the rods , the sheets have the same aspect ratio as the rods , where aspect ratio is defined by the ratio of the largest and smallest length scales .",
    "aspect ratio is often considered to be one of the most important properties for anisotropic particles , apart from the interactions with the surrounding matrix .",
    "the sheets represent a coarse - grained model of clay - silicate nanoparticles  @xcite , and in the literature these objects are also termed `` tethered membranes ''  @xcite .",
    "each monomer in the @xmath30 array has non - bonded interactions described by the same lj forces as the polymers .",
    "the monomers are also bonded to their 4 nearest neighbors via the same fene bond potential of eq .",
    "( [ equation : vlin ] ) .",
    "the particles at edges and corners of the sheet are only bonded to 3 and 2 neighboring particles , respectively . like the rods",
    ", the sheets are stiffened with a @xmath31 potential to prevent the nanoparticle from folding in on itself .",
    "the sheets also include a perpendicular bonding potential @xmath32 which limits distortions from a square geometry . without the potential @xmath33 , the sheet can deform into a rhombus . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the sheets .",
    "thus far , we have not defined a nanoparticle - monomer potential . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the same lj potential of eq .",
    "( [ equation : vlj ] ) was used for nanoparticle - monomer interactions , with the well depth @xmath36 replaced by @xmath37 .",
    "the soft @xmath38 form of the attraction makes it relatively easy for monomers which are first and second nearest neighbors of a nanoparticle to exchange . as a result ,",
    "the chains can `` slide ''",
    "relatively easily along the nanoparticle surface , thereby reducing any benefits of networks built by chain bridging  @xcite . to make monomer exchange at the surface less favorable",
    ", we use a `` 12 - 24 '' potential @xmath39 rather than the standard `` 6 - 12 '' powers of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the the nanoparticle - monomer interactions are of the form @xmath41 - v_{12 - 24}(r_c ) & r_{\\rm ij } \\le r_c \\\\ 0 & r_{\\rm ij } > r_c \\end{array } \\right . , \\label{equation : deepwell}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this potential has shorter range and stronger forces binding the first neighbor monomers to the nanoparticle . so that the total energy of the potential well , i.e. @xmath44 , is the same as that of the lj potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath45 . in this way , the total potential energy is comparable to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath46 , which led to well - dispersed nanoparticles in that study .",
    "thus , we expect our systems will be well - dispersed .",
    "however , we shall see this is _ not _ entirely the case for the systems with sheet nanoparticles .",
    "figure  [ fig : systems ] shows snapshots of a typical configuration for each system studied .",
    "we generate initial configurations using the same approach as in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely growing vacancies so that the nanoparticles can be accommodated . however , this process generates artificial initial configurations , and so we generate subsequent `` seed '' configurations by simulating at @xmath47 where reorganization occurs on relatively short time scales . depending on the nanoparticle type , we extract independent starting configurations every @xmath48 to @xmath49 time steps .",
    "subsequently , we make the necessary changes in density and chain length before cooling and relaxing at @xmath50 .",
    "a possible concern is that at @xmath50 , monomers will stick to the nanoparticle surface on a time scale that is long compared to the simulation , since @xmath45 ; however , we confirmed that monomers of chains exchange with the nanoparticle surface many times over the simulation .",
    "the equilibration time depends on the system type and is directly related to particle size .",
    "pure systems relax relatively quickly , needing only @xmath48 time steps .",
    "icosahedral systems need roughly @xmath49 time steps before reaching thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the rods and sheet nanoparticles are much larger , and thus diffuse more slowly . as a result , these systems require in excess of @xmath51 time steps to reach equilibrium .",
    "given that equilibration requires more than @xmath49 time steps at @xmath50 , equilibration under conditions of entanglement or supercooling would be computationally prohibitive .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion via the reversible reference system propagator algorithm ( rrespa ) , a multiple time step algorithm used to improve simulation speed  @xcite .",
    "we use a basic time step of 0.002 for a 3-cycle velocity verlet version of rrespa with forces divided into `` fast '' bonded ( @xmath25 , @xmath52 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 ) and `` slow '' non - bonded ( @xmath18,@xmath53 ) components .",
    "the temperature is controlled using the nose - hoover method where the adjustable `` mass '' of the thermostat is selected to match the intrinsic frequency obtained from theoretical calculations of a face - centered cubic lj system  @xcite .",
    "to study rheological properties , we shear equilibrated configurations using the sslod equations of motion  @xcite , integrated using the same rrespa algorithm used for equilibrium simulation . the sllod method generates the velocity profile for couette flow . if we choose the flow along the @xmath54-axis and the gradient of the flow along the @xmath55-axis , the shear rate dependent viscosity is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the average of the @xmath54-@xmath55 components of the pressure tensor ( sometimes also called the stress tensor ) , and @xmath58 is the shear rate  @xcite .",
    "we limit our simulations to small enough shear rates to avoid potential instabilities associated with breaking fene bonds in the simulation  @xcite .",
    "we choose a loading fraction @xmath59 , defined by the ratio of the number of nanoparticle force sites to the total number of system force sites ; values of this order of magnitude are common in experimental studies .",
    "@xcite since all force sites have the same diameter , @xmath60 should also be roughly equal to the volume fraction . due to the fact both polymers and nanoparticles consist of a discrete number of force sites",
    ", @xmath60 varies slightly between systems . for the icosahedral systems",
    "@xmath61 , and for the rods and sheets @xmath62 . the system size for all three nanoparticle systems is much larger than either the radius of gyration of the polymers , or the largest nanoparticle dimension , to avoid finite size effects . the number of chains @xmath63 ranges from @xmath64 in the smallest system up to @xmath65 for the largest systems . for each system",
    "we examine chain lengths @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . for this polymer model , the entanglement length @xmath69 30 to 40  @xcite .",
    "hence , only the longest chains studied may exhibit any effects of entanglement and the effects should be small in the present work .",
    "we reiterate that effects of dynamics due to proximity to the glass transition should not play a significant role at the relative high @xmath15 of our systems .",
    "a summary of the system parameters can be found in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the role of nanoparticle geometry on the magnitude of @xmath0 and clarify the influence of chain bridging on @xmath0 for a range of shear rates ( @xmath70 , 0.007 , 0.01 , and 0.02 ) and chain lengths . in the nanocomposite simulations of  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 became nearly constant at @xmath71  in other words , we are near the newtonian limit where @xmath0 approaches a stationary value for @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we expect our lowest shear rates approach the newtonian regime ; in this sense , the shear rates we use are fairly low . however",
    ", if we consider @xmath73 in physical units , these rates would be extremely high by experimental standards .",
    "ideally , we would estimate @xmath0 in the @xmath74 limit directly ( for example , by using an einstein or green - kubo relation ) , but the accurate evaluation of @xmath0 using these methods is difficult  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : shear_figure_1 ] shows @xmath0 for the three nanocomposites and pure polymer as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "these data show a clear change in @xmath0 between the systems for all @xmath58 simulated , with the rods having the largest @xmath0 , followed by the icosahedra , sheets , and finally the bulk polymer .",
    "the decrease of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath58 is indicative of shear thinning .",
    "we note that @xmath0 is not constant at the lowest @xmath58 , indicating we have not yet reached the newtonian regime .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the pure polymer has a viscosity approximately an order of magnitude smaller than any of the composites .",
    "comparable differences in @xmath0 have been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates an enhancement of @xmath0 through the addition of nanoparticles , which is often a desired goal of adding nanoparticles to a polymer melt .",
    "while the figure only shows @xmath0 for the @xmath75 and @xmath76 , other chain lengths and densities indicate the same trend .",
    "figure  [ fig : shear_figure_2 ] ( a ) shows the effect of varying @xmath3 on @xmath0 at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "an increase in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath3 is expected from basic polymer physics since the chain friction coefficient increases with @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "interchain interactions and `` entanglement '' interactions enhance this rate of increase since the friction coefficient of each chain increases linearly with @xmath3 . while it is clear that addition of nanoparticles increases @xmath0 of the resulting composite , the reasons for this are not obvious . since the pure polymer has a relatively low @xmath0 it is reasonable to assume that the rigid nanoparticles themselves inherently raise @xmath0 as in any suspension of particles in fluid matrix . to separate out this continuum hydrodynamic effect of the nanoparticles from the effects specifically due to polymer - nanoparticle interactions ,",

    "the intrinsic viscosity of a regular icosahedron has been estimated to be 2.47  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between this value and our icosahedral nanoparticles arises from the fact that our nanoparticles are not regular solids , but rather consist of a group of spherical force sites with icosahedral symmetry .",

    "one possibility that has recently been discussed  @xcite is that slip rather than stick boundary conditions might provide a better description of nanoparticle boundary conditions .",
    "however , this would result in a _ decrease _ of the predicted value of @xmath79  @xcite relative to the stick case , which is in the wrong direction for explaining our results . at a molecular level",
    ", the boundary conditions are clearly neither stick nor slip , as particles have finite residence times at the surface , although it is difficult to determine hydrodynamic boundary conditions directly from molecular considerations .",
    "nanoparticle - polymer interactions and nanoparticle clustering are evidently factors that might cause the property enhancements we observe , and in the next section we focus on this possibility .",

    ", @xmath90 evidently stays fairly constant as @xmath3 varies .",
    "while the order of the systems for @xmath90 is consistent with the trend for @xmath0 , the similarity between the rods and icosahedra suggests that the fraction of nanoparticles alone is not responsible for determining composite viscosity . of note , is the large fraction of nanoparticle contacts for the @xmath96 sheet system at equilibrium .",
    "more in - depth analysis shows that the sheets favor a clustered state at lower density , i.e. chains no longer fully intercalate between the sheets .",
    "both the @xmath97 and @xmath98 sheet systems have intercalating polymers , while the @xmath96 case does not .",
    "the tendency of the sheets to stack is due in part to entropic interactions that result from depletion attractions between the sheet ; the depletion interactions arise due to physically adsorbed polymers on the sheet surface , much like the depletion interactions of polymer coated colloids .",
    "@xcite this interaction is most pronounced for the sheets , presumably due to the large and relatively flat surface of a sheet , which more effectively reduces the entropy of chains at the surface .",

    "there are also clear trends : @xmath99 increases with increasing @xmath3 and for every value of @xmath3 the system containing the rods have the largest value of @xmath99 , followed by the system containing the icosahedra , and finally the system containing the sheets .",

    "thus , we extend our analysis to test for a correlation between @xmath0 and chain bridging .",
    "we define a `` bridging chain '' as a chain that is simultaneously in contact with two or more nanoparticles . figure  [ fig : bridging ] shows @xmath100 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath76 .",

    "although not shown , the results seen in fig .  [ fig : bridging ] occur for every value of @xmath103 that we have simulated .",
    "hence , the fraction of bridging chains seems to be a useful `` order parameter '' for characterizing the polymer - nanoparticle interactions .",
    "if the polymer - nanoparticle interactions were sufficiently small , the bridging would not be expected to play significant role , and it is likely that the continuum hydrodynamic approach would be applicable .",
    "similar to the notion of bridging is the idea that the nanoparticles can act as transient cross - linkers that can lead to effects equivalent with the formation of higher molecular weight chains  @xcite . to test this idea",
    ", we define an `` effective chain '' as the collection of chains that are connected by nanoparticles .",
    "we then define an effective chain length @xmath104 as the mean mass of chains connected by the nanoparticles .",
    "[ fig : effective_chains ] shows that @xmath104 is almost an order of magnitude larger than @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we expect that the largest contribution to the @xmath0 increase comes from this effect . even in the simplest rouse theory ,",

    "the formation of longer effective chains is expected to lead to entanglement interactions that would further amplify the @xmath0 increase , as emphasize by ref .",

    "the ultimate isotropic tensile strength @xmath1 of a material is defined as the maximum tension a homogeneously stretched material can sustain before fracture . while this definition can be directly probed experimentally , the situation is less straightforward and computationally accessible in an md simulation . ref .",
    "@xcite has developed an approach to estimate @xmath1 based on potential energy - landscape ( pel ) formalism that is accessible by md simulation .",

    "@xcite discusses an alternate approach using the pel to evaluate the elastic constants .    to determine @xmath1",

    "this configurational mapping procedure corresponds to the physical process of instantaneous cooling to the @xmath106 limit to obtain an ideal glass with no kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , by sampling thermally equilibrated configurations and minimizing their energies we can estimate the average inherent structure pressure , @xmath107 , which will be negative when the system is under tension .",
    "the maximum tension then defines @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath107 has been found to be weakly dependent on the @xmath15 at which the sampling is performed .",
    "for example , while cyclopentane has a strongly temperature dependent structure , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that equilibrium @xmath15 only weakly effects @xmath107 .",
    "since the structures in our systems do not display such dependence , we expect our results also to be independent of the starting equilibrium @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we can use the same systems at @xmath50 that we used to determine @xmath0 and still obtain reliable results for @xmath1  even though the starting configuration is a highly fluid state .",
    "this calculation of @xmath1 should be an _ upper bound _ for the tensile strength that would be obtained for any finite @xmath15 system , and hence is referred to the as the ultimate tensile strength .",
    "the energy minimization process eliminates the high frequency effects that would normally be associated with such high @xmath15 states and thus the method refers to the strength of an ideal glass material having essentially no configurational entropy .",
    "figure  [ fig : congrad_n20 ] shows the @xmath107 curves generated for the @xmath108 variant of each system .",
    "we find that @xmath107 decreases at large @xmath103 , until a minimum value is reached .",
    "the density of the minimum , referred to as the `` sastry density '' @xmath109  @xcite , characterizes the density where the system fractures , and voids first start to appear in the minimized configurations . as @xmath103 decreases below this point , @xmath107 begins to rise .",
    "since this is the greatest tension achievable , we have @xmath110 . for pure , icosahedral , and rod systems",
    "we find @xmath111 , while for the sheets it is much lower @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , @xmath1 is considerably larger for the sheets than for the other systems .",
    "we find that the increase in @xmath1 for the sheets is not as sizable as observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the fact that ( experimentally ) the chains often form stronger associations with layered silicates than in our simulations ; additionally , the chain lengths we examine are small compared to experiments , and we will see that @xmath1 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "we note that at this chain length , the icosahedra and rods actually _ reduce _ the strength of the nanocomposite as compared to the pure melt .    to quantify the chain length dependence of @xmath1 , we plot the minimum of each @xmath107 curve as a function of @xmath3 in fig .  [",
    "fig : total ] . for the pure polymers ,",
    "we find that @xmath1 _ decreases _ with increasing chain length .",
    "this is non - trivial , since one might navely expect longer chains to exhibit more interchain coupling .",
    "this is the same trend with chain length as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath113-alkanes .",
    "it is reassuring that simple bead - spring model leads to similar results but this does not help us build intuition about the physical meaning of these results .",
    "reference  @xcite finds a maximum @xmath1 for @xmath114 , and a tendency for @xmath115 to saturate near @xmath116 . since the smallest chain we simulate is @xmath66 , we are above the regime where this feature occurs .",
    "consistent with these facts , @xmath1 decreases with @xmath3 and @xmath109 is roughly independent of @xmath3 .",
    "most importantly , fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] shows that the addition of the nanoparticles _ reverses _ the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath1 when compared to the pure system .",
    "thus , while the presence of icosahedral or rod - like nanoparticles decreases the material strength for most chain lengths studied , the trend of @xmath1 is increasing , and if this continues , @xmath1 will surpass the pure melt for all nanoparticle shapes at large enough @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 for the icosahedra nanocomposite already exceeds that of the melt at @xmath117 .      to better understand the predicted @xmath3 dependence of @xmath1",
    ", we perform a parallel analysis to the structural analysis of shear runs discussed above . the analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig : np - np]-[fig : bridging ] focused on @xmath76 .",
    "we relate the structure to @xmath1 by examining the structure at @xmath109 .",
    "evidently , @xmath109 differs for the sheets in relation to the other systems studied , and it is possible that @xmath103 dependent changes in connectivity properties are responsible for the difference of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we calculate the quantities @xmath100 , @xmath90 , and @xmath99 at @xmath109 for each system using the equilibrium and is configurations at the sastry density @xmath109 of the system .",
    "the results for the equilibrium and is configurations show the same qualitative trends , so we will present only data for the is .",
    "we first focus on @xmath100 because our investigations into the rheological properties suggested that bridging chains played a large role in determining @xmath0 . however , when we plot @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bridging_minimized ] for each system at @xmath109 , we see that the @xmath3 dependence is the _ reverse _ of that seen for @xmath1 , even though this quantity evidently follows @xmath0 . even for the sheets which have a @xmath109 significantly lower value of than the other systems ,",
    "the ordering of @xmath100 among the systems is the same as for @xmath100 in the case of the @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the sheet composites have the smallest @xmath100 , followed by those with icosahedra , and those with rods .",
    "while bridging chains do increase with increasing @xmath3 , @xmath100 does _ not _ seem to be a major factor in the relative value of @xmath1 between the composites .",
    "for example , the @xmath66 nanocomposites with icosahedra and sheets have almost the same value of @xmath100 , yet they have significantly different values for @xmath1 .",
    "the fewer bridging chains in the systems with square sheets suggests that the sheets may be clustered , and we find that this is indeed the case for @xmath117 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : np - np ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "thus , we plot @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : np - np_minimized ] and find indeed that @xmath118 for the sheets .",
    "the sheets prefer a stacked state at low @xmath103 due to entropic interactions with polymers which leads to a reduced explicit energetic interaction with the surrounding polymers .",
    "in particular , the relative ordering of @xmath90 matches that of @xmath1 .",
    "navely , this would seem to suggest a potential correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , this apparent correlation is problematic .",
    "firstly , the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath90 are different , namely @xmath1 monotonically increases , while @xmath90 is roughly constant .",
    "secondly , if the nanoparticles interactions are the origin of the increased strength , then one might expect to find the largest effect when the nanoparticles are well dispersed  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case , since the clustered sheets give the _",
    "largest _ effect .    ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the rupture of the system occurs in `` weak spots . '' to confirm that the nanoparticles actually impart additional strength , we visually examined the location of fracture in our systems at @xmath109 . to find empty spaces that are at least the size of a particle ,",
    "we discretize the system into a cubic lattice of overlapping spheres , each with a radius @xmath119 and a nearest neighbor separation @xmath120 .",
    "we then identify spheres that do not contain any system force site . by adjusting the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "we can ensure that the voids we find are at least large enough for a single particle .",
    "since the force sites of both the nanoparticles and polymers have diameter @xmath121 , we must choose @xmath122 to have physical relevance .",
    "we find that values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 work best for visualizing voids .",
    "figure  [ fig : voids ] shows that the voids in the system occur in regions of pure polymer for the icosahedral system .",
    "the same is also true for the rods and square sheets .",
    "quantitative analysis of the force sites within nearest - neighbor distance @xmath125 of the voids confirmed this suggestion , with over 99  % of the resulting force sites belonging to polymer chains .",
    "thus , while the nanoparticles impart an increased strength to the nanocomposite , the correlation to @xmath90 is not apparently causal .",
    "evidently , there is something more subtle controlling the magnitude of @xmath1 in the sheet filled nanocomposite that we have not yet identified .    to complete the structural analysis",
    "we calculate @xmath99 for the is .",
    "figure  [ fig : fraction_minimized ] shows that the sheet nanoparticles are not in contact with many polymers , consistent with the fact that @xmath118 . in fact , after minimization the difference in @xmath99 between the rods and the sheets is even larger than observed in the equilibrium configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] . figure  [ fig : fraction_minimized ] shows that the relative ordering of @xmath99 is _ opposite _ to that of @xmath1 , hence the number of nanoparticle - polymer contacts alone also does not provide a good indicator of @xmath1 .",
    "a potential clue to the increase of @xmath1 of the sheet nanocomposite is the fact that @xmath109 is _ significantly smaller _ than for the other systems .",
    "this allows the sheet composites to undergo a greater deformation before fracture .",
    "this large increase in both the strength and toughness of the polymer matrix with incorporation of nanoparticles is reminiscent of the changes in the properties of natural and synthetic rubbers with the inclusion of carbon black and nanofiller additives  @xcite .",
    "extraordinarily large increases in both the strength and toughness of materials have recently been observed in the case of exfoliated clay sheets dispersed in the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf )  @xcite .",
    "although some of this change is associated with the modification of the crystallization morphology by the clay nanoparticles , this does not explain in itself the observed toughening mechanism .",
    "it is known that nanofiller particles can behave as temporary cross - linking agents that impart viscoelastic characteristics to the fluid .",
    "gersappe  @xcite further emphasizes the role of this transient network formation in impeding cavitation events that initiate material rupture and the potential significance of this phenomenon in understanding the nature of biological adhesives ( abalone ) , fibers ( spider silk ) , and shell material ( nacre )  @xcite .",
    "gersappe further suggests that the relative mobility of nanoparticles has a role on the toughening of materials .",
    "however , such reasoning is inconsistent with the fact that the sheet nanoparticles lead to the strongest material while being the _ least mobile _ of our additives .",
    "recent work indicates that flexible sheet - like structures , such as studied here , are characterized by a _",
    "negative _ poisson ratio @xmath126  @xcite , _ i.e. _  the material expands normal the the direction of stretching , as opposed to normal materials which expand in the same direction as the stretching . the formation of a composite material with negative poisson ratio ( `` auxetic '' materials ) is expected to lead to a reduction of the poisson ratio of the composite as a whole  @xcite .",
    "a large reduction in @xmath126 is expected to give rise to materials that are strong and fracture resistant  @xcite .",
    "related to this , we observe in our simulations that the voids that form in the sheet - filled nanocomposites tend to be fewer and smaller than those for the other nanoparticles at @xmath109 .",
    "as we further reduce @xmath103 for the sheet system , the voids grow more numerous as opposed to growing larger as in the other nanocomposites .",
    "microvoid formation has also been established as a mechanism for toughening polymer materials  @xcite .",
    "previous work devoted to understanding the high impact strength of polycarbonate and other glassy polymers has likewise emphasized the importance of large `` free volume '' within the polymer material as a necessary condition for large toughness  @xcite .",
    "based on our simulation results and previous observations , we tentatively suggest that the addition of these `` springy '' sheet materials reduces the effective poisson ratio of our nanocomposites , and that the microvoid formation process that we observe is a manifestation of the non - uniformities in the elastic constants within the nanocomposite . in principle , the elastic constants can be determined by the pel approach  @xcite , but this analysis will be deferred to a future work since it is rather involved .",
    "our tentative interpretation of the predicted @xmath1 variation in the sheet nanocomposites also suggests the need for better characterization of the geometric rigidity properties of the sheet nanoparticles , since these variables may be important for understating how such particles modify the stiffness and toughness of nanocomposites .",
    "in this work we have focused on how nanoparticle shape influences the viscosity of polymer - nanoparticle melt mixtures at high temperature and the ultimate tensile strength ( estimated from the pel formalism ) of polymer nanocomposites in the ideal glass state .",
    "our results suggest that chain bridging between the nanoparticles can have a large effect on @xmath0 of the mixture when the polymer - particle interactions are attractive , so that the nanoparticles disperse readily .",
    "in addition , there is a relatively weak increase in @xmath0 for sheet nanoparticle composites , which tend to cluster in our simulations , supporting the expectation that nanoparticle clustering diminishes the viscosity enhancement .",
    "( however , the formation of `` open '' or percolating fractal clusters may have the opposite effect on viscosity ) .",
    "curiously , the tensile strength of the sheet nanocomposite is greatest , in spite of the sheet stacking .",
    "one of the most intriguing effects of the nanoparticles is that , regardless of shape , the dependence of the tensile strength on chain length for the nanocomposites is _ opposite _ to that for the pure polymer melt .",
    "we reiterate that our results for @xmath1 rely on the pel approach , and this approach should be carefully compared with experimental measurements to test the expected relationship between @xmath1 from simulations and tensile strength found experimentally .",
    "the trends observed for the @xmath1 are more difficult to understand than those for @xmath0 .",
    "there is evidently no clear - cut correlation of @xmath1 with the formation of bridging chains or with the attractive particle - particle interactions . in the absence of such a correlation",

    "recent work has noted that molecularly thin sheets have a negative poisson ratio when they are flexible enough to crumple by thermal fluctuations .",
