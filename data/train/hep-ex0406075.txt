    "recently , observations of large branching fractions for three - body charmless hadronic decays of @xmath5 mesons have been reported by the @xmath5 factory experiments @xcite . in the mesonic",
    "decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 , a large fraction of the decays proceed through intermediate two - body decay processes , such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , higher mass @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 states may contribute but are not clearly identified due to limited statistics .",
    "moreover , the broad @xmath21 mass spectrum above 1.5 gev/@xmath22 in @xmath23 suggests a large non - resonant @xmath23 contribution . in the baryonic decay @xmath24",
    ", a simple phase - space model fails to describe the @xmath25 mass spectrum , which may be explained by a baryonic form factor model @xcite or by an additional , unknown resonance around 2 gev/@xmath22 .",
    "these studies of three - body decays have provided new information on the mechanism of b meson decay , and provide opportunities to search for unknown @xmath5 meson decays and to understand the interference between them .",
    "in this paper we report on a study of @xmath5 meson decays to @xmath1 , independently of possible intermediate states .",
    "in addition , we also present results of a search for quasi - two - body intermediate states .",
    "inclusion of charge conjugate modes is always implied in this letter unless otherwise specified .",
    "the results are obtained from data collected by the belle detector @xcite at the kekb asymmetric @xmath3 storage ring @xcite .",
    "the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 78 fb@xmath2 and contains 85.0 million @xmath26 pairs at the @xmath27 resonance .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle general purpose spectrometer based on a 1.5 t superconducting solenoidal magnet .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed with a three layer double - sided silicon vertex detector ( svd ) and a central drift chamber ( cdc ) that consists of 50 layers segmented into 6 axial and 5 stereo superlayers .",
    "the cdc covers the polar angle range between @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the laboratory frame and , together with the svd , gives a transverse momentum resolution of @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in gev/@xmath33 .",
    "charged hadron identification is performed using a combination of three devices : an array of 1188 aerogel erenkov counters ( acc ) covering the momentum range 14 gev/@xmath33 , a time - of - flight scintillation counter system ( tof ) for track momenta below 1.5 gev/@xmath33 , and @xmath34 information from the cdc for particles with low or high momenta .",
    "situated between these devices and the solenoid coil is an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) consisting of 8736 csi(t@xmath35 ) crystals with a typical front - surface cross - section of @xmath36 @xmath37 and a depth of @xmath38 .",
    "the ecl provides a photon energy resolution of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are in gev .",
    "an instrumented iron flux return outside the solenoid coil is used for muon and @xmath42 detection .",
    "a detailed description of the belle detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "charged tracks are required to come from the collision point and have transverse momenta , @xmath31 , above 100 mev/@xmath33 .",
    "the accepted tracks are then refitted with their vertex position constrained to the run - averaged profile of @xmath5 meson decay vertices in the transverse plane .",
    "charged @xmath43 and @xmath44 mesons are identified by combining information from the cdc ( @xmath34 ) , the tof and the acc to form a @xmath45 likelihood @xmath46 .",
    "discrimination between kaons and pions is achieved through the likelihood ratio @xmath47/(@xmath48 ) .",
    "the performance of the charged hadron identification is studied using a kinematically selected high momentum @xmath49 data sample , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we measure the pion and kaon identification efficiencies and their fake rates as functions of track momentum .",
    "the typical kaon and pion identification efficiencies for 1 gev/@xmath33 tracks are @xmath52% and @xmath53% , respectively .",
    "the rate for true pions to be misidentified as kaons is @xmath54% , while the rate for true kaons to be misidentified as pions is @xmath55% .",
    "charged tracks which are positively identified as electrons and muons are rejected .",
    "candidate neutral pions are selected by requiring the two - photon invariant mass to be in the mass window @xmath56 gev/@xmath57 gev/@xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath58 mass resolution with momentum above 2 gev/@xmath33 . the momentum of each photon is then readjusted , constraining the mass of the photon pair to be the nominal @xmath59 mass . to reduce the background from soft photons , each photon is required to have energy above 50 mev and",
    "the minimum @xmath59 momentum is 200 mev/@xmath33 .",
    "candidate @xmath5 mesons are identified using the beam constrained mass , @xmath60 , and the energy difference , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is run - dependent and determined from @xmath63 events , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the momentum and energy of the @xmath5 candidate in the @xmath27 rest frame .",
    "the parameterizations of the signal in @xmath66 and @xmath67 are determined by a gean - based monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite simulation of non - resonant @xmath68 decays , and various quasi - two - body decays to the @xmath1 final state .",
    "the signal parameterization is verified using the data and mc samples of @xmath69 candidates .",
    "our mc overestimates the @xmath66 resolution by 8% but underestimates the @xmath67 resolution by 9% to 15% , depending on the kinematics of the @xmath1 events .",
    "the mc based signal probability density functions ( pdf ) are readjusted accordingly .",
    "the gaussian width of the signal in @xmath66 is about 3.0 mev/@xmath22 , which is primarily due to the beam energy spread .",
    "the @xmath67 distribution is found to be asymmetric , with a tail on the lower side due to @xmath70 interactions with material in front of the calorimeter , and shower leakage out of the back side of the crystals . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath67 resolution and the tail distribution strongly depend on the @xmath59 energy ; the @xmath67 width ranges from 20 mev to 33 mev . in the inclusive @xmath1 study , since the @xmath59 energy distribution for the signal is not known a priori , the data is divided into three samples : @xmath71 gev/@xmath33 , @xmath72 gev/@xmath73 gev/@xmath33 and @xmath74 gev/@xmath33 . the @xmath67 distribution in each sample is modeled with a crystal ball lineshape @xcite with parameters determined from mc .",

    "five modified fox - wolfram moments @xcite and a measure of the momentum transverse to the event thrust axis ( @xmath84 ) @xcite are combined into a fisher discriminant .",
    "the pdfs for this discriminant and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the angle between the @xmath5 flight direction and the beam direction in the @xmath27 rest frame , are obtained using events in the signal and sideband regions from mc simulations for signal and @xmath87 background .",
    "these two variables are then combined to form a likelihood ratio @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the product of signal ( @xmath87 ) probability densities .",
    "continuum background is suppressed by requiring @xmath90 , based on a study of the signal significance ( @xmath91 ) using a mc sample , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are signal and background yields , respectively .",
    "this @xmath94 requirement retains 45% of the signal and removes 97% of the continuum events .",
    "the effect of the @xmath94 cut is studied by comparing @xmath95 in data and mc , for different values of @xmath94 .",

    "one - dimensional binned likelihood fits to @xmath67 and @xmath66 are performed using signal , continuum background and @xmath26 background pdfs for events in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 signal region , respectively . since the @xmath66 shapes from @xmath26 background are difficult to distinguish from signal shapes , the signal yields are estimated using the @xmath67 fit and cross checked by the @xmath66 fit , where the @xmath26 background fraction is fixed to the mc expectation .",

    "the sum of the signal yield from the @xmath67 fits to the three subsamples , @xmath107 , is consistent with the yield from the @xmath66 fit , @xmath108 , which has a smaller signal efficiency than the @xmath67 fit due to the tighter @xmath67 requirement .",

    "signal efficiencies are first obtained from mc simulations , and then corrected by comparing data and mc predictions for other processes .",

    "the uncertainty on this inclusive efficiency is 5% , determined by checking the reconstruction efficiencies on various two - body modes .",
    "the @xmath59 reconstruction efficiency is verified by comparing the @xmath59 decay angular distribution with the mc prediction , and by measuring the ratio of the branching fractions of two @xmath110 decay channels : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "the final systematic errors on the reconstruction efficiencies , including charged particle and @xmath59 detection , particle identification and the @xmath94 cut , range from 7 to 14% for the quasi - two - body decays and is 8.2% for the inclusive @xmath1 channel .",
    "table [ tbl : result ] summarizes the fit results for each reconstructed decay channel .",
    "the branching fractions and upper limits are calculated assuming that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are produced with equal probability .",
    "the systematic errors on the branching fractions combine the systematic errors for the reconstruction efficiencies and the @xmath67 fit with the uncertainty from the number of @xmath26 events . since no signal is seen in the @xmath118 mode , and the signal yield in the central region of the dalitz plot",
    "is not significant , upper limits are computed at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) based on the observed number of events in the signal region , and the background level found by the fit ; both the statistical and systematic errors are taken into account  @xcite .",

    "using the large signals observed in the inclusive @xmath68 and @xmath121 modes , we search for direct @xmath10 violation by dividing the data into two subsets , according to the charge of the kaon .",
    "the asymmetry , defined as @xmath126 , is then computed using the @xmath5 signal yields obtained from @xmath67 fits . following the same fitting procedure , we observe @xmath127 events and @xmath128 events , while the @xmath67 fit yields @xmath129 @xmath130 events and @xmath131 @xmath132 events ( see fig.[fig : acp ] ) .",

    "the obtained systematic error is @xmath135 . adding this @xmath135 error in quadrature with the fitting systematic error , obtained by varying each parameter in the pdfs by @xmath136 , gives the total systematic error .",
