    "a central goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) being built at cern is the discovery of the higgs boson , a key component of the standard model , and whose discovery would also constitute the first observation of an elementary scalar field .",
    "a number of theoretical analyses suggest the existence of a light higgs boson with a mass @xmath2 .",
    "perhaps the most novel production process for the higgs is the exclusive exclusive diffractive reaction , @xmath3  @xcite , where the + sign stands for a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) between the produced particles .",
    "if both protons are detected , the mass and momentum distribution of the higgs can be determined .",
    "the totem detector  @xcite proposed for the lhc will have the capability to detect exclusive diffractive channels .",
    "the detection of the higgs via the exclusive diffractive process @xmath4 , has the advantage that it does not depend on a specific decay mechanism for the higgs .",
    "the branching ratios for the decay modes of the higgs can then be individually determined by combining the measurement of @xmath5 with the rate for a specific exclusive diffractive final states @xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard inclusive measurement where one can only determine the product of the cross section and branching ratios @xmath7    the existing theoretical estimates for exclusive diffractive higgs production are based on the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess , where two hard gluons couple to the higgs @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "a third gluon is also exchanged in order that both projectiles remain color singlets .",
    "perturbative qcd then predicts @xmath9 for the production of a higgs boson of mass 120 gev at lhc energies , with a factor of 2 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "since the annihilating gluons each carry a small fraction of the momentum of the proton , the higgs is primarily produced in the central rapidity region .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we proposed a novel mechanism for exclusive diffractive higgs production in which the higgs is produced with a significant fraction of the projectile s momentum .",
    "the key assumption underlying our analysis is the presence of intrinsic charm ( ic ) and intrinsic bottom ( ib ) fluctuations in the proton bound state  @xcite , whose existence at high @xmath1 has a substantial and growing experimental and theoretical support .",
    "the virtual fock state @xmath10 of one of the incident protons has a long lifetime at high energies and can be materialized in the collision by the exchange of gluons .",
    "the heavy quark and antiquark from the same projectile then coalesce to produce the higgs boson at large @xmath11    it was originally suggested in ref .",
    "[ 4,5 ] that there is a @xmath12 probability of ic fock states in the nucleon ; more recently , the operator product expansion has been used to show that the probability for fock states in light hadron to have an extra heavy quark pair of mass @xmath13 decreases only as @xmath14 in a non - abelian gauge theory @xcite . in the case of abelian qed ,",
    "the probability of an intrinsic heavy lepton pair in a light - atom such as positronium is suppressed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bohr momentum .",
    "the quartic qed scaling corresponds to the dimension-@xmath17 euler - heisenberg effective hamiltonian @xmath18 for light - by light scattering mediated by heavy leptons . here",
    "@xmath19 is the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding effective hamiltonian in qcd @xmath20 has dimension @xmath21 the maximal probability for an intrinsic heavy quark fock state occurs for minimal off - shellness ; i.e. , at minimum invariant mass squared @xmath22 thus the dominant fock state configuration is @xmath23 where @xmath24 i.e. , at equal rapidity .",
    "since all of the quarks tend to travel coherently at same rapidity in the @xmath25 intrinsic heavy quark fock state , the heaviest constituents carry the most momentum  @xcite .",
    "the most direct test of intrinsic charm is the measurement of the charm quark distribution @xmath26 in deep inelastic scattering @xmath27 the only experiment which has looked for a charm signal at large @xmath28 is the european muon collaboration ( emc ) experiment  @xcite which used prompt muon decay in deep inelastic muon - proton scattering to tag the produced charm quark .",
    "the emc data show a distinct excess of events in the charm quark distribution at @xmath29 at a rate at least an order of magnitude beyond lowest predictions based on gluon splitting and dglap evolution .",
    "more recent next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analyses  @xcite show that an intrinsic charm component , with probability of order @xmath30 , is needed to fit the emc data in the large @xmath28 region .",
    "the existence of the rare double ic fock state such as @xmath31 leads to the production of two @xmath32 s  @xcite or a double - charm baryon state at large @xmath33 and small @xmath34 .",
    "double @xmath32 events at a high combined @xmath35 were in fact observed by na3  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the doubly - charmed baryon @xmath36 has been confirmed recently by selex at fnal  @xcite ; the presence of two charm quarks at large @xmath33 has , indeed , a natural ic interpretation . ]",
    "we will now explain , using fig .  1 , how the exclusive diffractive production arises with the required color structure in the final state .",
    "as noted above , the ic fock state of the projectile ( upper ) proton has a @xmath30 probability to fluctuate to the state with the color structure @xmath37_{8_c}[\\bar c c]_{8_c}>$ ] .",
    "it has a long coherence length in a high energy collision @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total invariant final mass , which is much larger than the initial mass . in a @xmath40 collision ,",
    "two soft gluons must be exchanged in order to keep the target ( lower ) proton intact and to create a rapidity gap .",
    "the two gluons will couple from the target to the large color dipole moment of the projectile ic fock state .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .  1",
    ", one gluon can be attached to the @xmath41 valence quark spectator in @xmath37_{8_c}[\\bar c c]_{8_c}>$ ] , changing its color , and the other one can be attached to the @xmath42 , changing also its color .",
    "the net effect of this color rearrangement is the same as a single gluon exchange between the two color - octet clusters .",
    "the @xmath43 and the @xmath44 thus can emerge as color singlet because of the gluonic exchange .",
    "the @xmath45_{1_c}$ ] now can couple to the @xmath32 color singlet , or to a @xmath46 or to a @xmath47 .",
    "meanwhile the color - singlet @xmath44 gives rise to the scattered proton , and we have the two required rapidity gaps in the final state . notice that the @xmath33 distribution of the produced particle is approximately the same as the distribution of the @xmath45 $ ] inside the proton .",
    "unfortunately the coupling of the gluon to all the different quarks brings in a form factor which vanishes at zero momentum transfer , and which therefore gives an important suppression factor .",
    "the cross section of exclusive diffractive production of the higgs , @xmath48 , can be estimate in two - gluon approximation in accordance with the feynman graph shown in fig .  1 .",
    "here we assume the presence in the proton of an intrinsic charm ( ic ) component , a @xmath49 pair which is predominantly in a color - octet state , and which has a nonperturbative origin and mixes in the proton with the @xmath50 valence quark component .",
    "correspondingly , like in charmonium , the mean @xmath49 separation should be much larger than the size @xmath51 of perturbative @xmath52 fluctuations . in fig .  1",
    ", @xmath53 denotes the light - cone wave function of the ic component of the initial proton , properly normalized , @xmath47 is the wave function of the color singlet @xmath45_{1_c}$ ] in the produced higgs and @xmath54 stands for the wave function of the final proton @xmath55 . the details and different aspects ( energy dependence , absortive corrections , etc ... ) of the calculation",
    "will be reported in ref .",
    "[ 3 ] , but we anticipate that the final result will turn out to be rather small . various possibilities to get a larger cross section will be also discussed , in particular , heavy flavors contribution or nuclear enhancement .",
