    "a collection of congruent spheres in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 is called a sphere packing if no two spheres overlap . the _ packing density _ or simply density @xmath6 of a sphere packing is the fraction of space @xmath1 covered by the spheres .",
    "hard - sphere packings have been used to model a variety of systems , including liquids @xcite , amorphous and granular media @xcite , and crystals @xcite . nonetheless , there is great interest in understanding sphere packings in high dimensions in various fields .",
    "for example , it is known that the optimal way of sending digital signals over noisy channels correspond to the densest sphere packing in a high dimensional space @xcite .",
    "these  error - correcting \" codes underlie a variety of systems in digital communications and storage , including compact disks , cell phones and the internet .",
    "physicists have studied hard - sphere packings in high dimensions to gain insight into ground and glassy states of matter as well as phase behavior in lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "the determination of the densest packings in arbitrary dimension is a problem of long - standing interest in discrete geometry @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to note that upper and lower bounds on the _ maximal density _",
    "@xmath7 exist in all dimensions @xcite , where the supremum is taken over all packings @xmath8 in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , minkowski @xcite proved that the maximal density @xmath9 among all bravais lattice packings for @xmath10 satisfies the lower bound @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "one observes that for large values of @xmath0 , the asymptotic behavior of the _ nonconstructive _ minkowski lower bound is controlled by @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , the density of a _ saturated _ packing of congruent spheres in @xmath1 for all @xmath0 satisfies @xmath14 a saturated packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter and density @xmath6 in @xmath15 has the property that each point in space lies within a unit distance from the center of some sphere .",
    "thus , a covering of the space is achieved if each center is encompassed by a sphere of unit radius and the density of this covering is @xmath16 , which proves the so - called _ greedy _ lower bound ( [ sat ] ) .",
    "note that it has the same dominant exponential term as ( [ mink ] ) .",
    "a statistically homogeneous ( i.e. , translationally invariant ) packing is completely configurationally characterized by specifying all of the @xmath2-particle correlation functions . for such packings in @xmath1 ,",
    "these correlation functions are defined so that @xmath17 is proportional to the probability density for simultaneously finding @xmath2 particles at locations @xmath18 within the system , where @xmath19 is the number density .",
    "thus , each @xmath20 approaches unity when all particle positions become widely separated within @xmath1 , indicating no spatial correlations . to date , an exact determination of all of the @xmath2-particle correlation functions for a packing has only been possible for @xmath21 in the special case of an equilibrium ensemble of such particles @xcite .",
    "observe that in the limit @xmath22 , it is known that the pressure of an equilibrium hard - sphere fluid is exactly given by the low - density expansion up to the second - virial level for a positive range of densities @xcite , which implies a simplified form for all of the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we present in section ii a generalization of the well - known random sequential addition ( rsa ) process of hard particles @xcite . in a particular limit of this nonequilibrium model that we call the  ghost \" rsa process",
    ", we are able to obtain the @xmath20 for all allowable densities exactly for any @xmath2 and dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the key geometric quantity that determines @xmath20 is the union volume of @xmath2 overlapping exclusion spheres of radius equal to the sphere diameter .",
    "we show that this construction of a disordered but _ unsaturated _ packing realizes the greedy lower bound ( [ sat ] ) .",
    "this implies that there may be disordered sphere packings in sufficiently high @xmath0 whose density exceeds minkowski s lower bound ( [ mink ] ) .",
    "indeed , in section iii , we report on a conjectural lower bound on the density whose asymptotic behavior is controlled by @xmath5 , thus providing the putative exponential improvement on minkowski s 100-year - old bound .",
    "our results lead to the counterintuitive possibility that optimal packings in sufficiently high dimensions may be disordered and thus have implications for our fundamental understanding of classical ground states of matter .",
    "we introduce a disordered sphere - packing model in @xmath1 that is a subset of the poisson point process and is a generalization of the standard random rsa process .",
    "the centers of  test \" spheres of unit diameter arrive continually throughout @xmath1 during time @xmath23 according to a translationally invariant poisson process of density @xmath24 per unit time , i.e. , @xmath24 is the number of points per unit volume and time .",
    "therefore , the expected number of centers in a region of volume @xmath25 during time @xmath26 is @xmath27 and the probability that this region is empty of centers is @xmath28 .",
    "however , this poisson distribution of test spheres is not a packing because the spheres can overlap . to create a packing from this point process",
    ", one must remove test spheres such that no sphere center can lie within a spherical region of unit radius from any sphere center . without loss of generality",
    ", we will set @xmath29 .",
    "there is a variety of ways of achieving this  thinning \" process such that the subset of points correspond to a sphere packing .",
    "one obvious rule is to retain a test sphere at time @xmath26 only if it does not overlap a sphere that was successfully added to the packing at an earlier time .",
    "this criterion defines the standard rsa process in @xmath1 @xcite , which generates a homogeneous and isotropic sphere packing in @xmath1 with a time - dependent density @xmath30 . in the limit @xmath31 , the rsa process corresponds to a saturated packing with a maximal or _",
    "density @xmath32 . in one dimension ,",
    "the rsa process is commonly known as the  car parking problem \" , which re ' nyi showed has a saturation density @xmath33 @xcite . for @xmath34 , an exact determination of @xmath35",
    "is not possible , but estimates for it have been obtained via computer experiments for low dimensions @xcite .",
    "another thinning criterion retains a test sphere centered at position @xmath36 at time @xmath26 if no other test sphere is within a unit radial distance from @xmath36 for the time interval @xmath37 prior to @xmath26 , where @xmath38 is a positive constant in the interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this packing is a subset of the rsa packing , and hence we refer to it as the generalized rsa process .",
    "note that when @xmath40 , the standard rsa process is recovered , and when @xmath41 , a model due to mat ' ern @xcite is recovered @xcite .",
    "the latter is amenable to exact analysis and is the main focus of this paper . for any @xmath42 ,",
    "the generalized rsa process is always an _ unsaturated _ packing .",
    "figure [ processes ] illustrates the differences between the generalized rsa process at the two extremes of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in remainder of this section",
    ", we will focus on the case @xmath41 .",
    "the time - dependent density @xmath30 in the case of the generalized rsa process with @xmath41 is easily obtained . in this packing , a test sphere at time @xmath26 is retained only if does not overlap an existing sphere in the packing as well as any previously rejected test sphere , which we will call  ghost \" spheres . the model itself",
    "will be referred to as the ghost rsa process .",
    "an overlap can not occur if a test sphere is outside a unit radius of any successfully added sphere or ghost sphere . because of the underlying poisson process , the probability that a trial sphere is retained at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the volume of a sphere of unit radius .",
    "therefore , the expected time - dependent number density @xmath45 and packing density @xmath46 at any time @xmath26 are given by @xmath47 in the limit @xmath31 , we therefore have that @xmath48 observe that the greedy lower bound ( [ sat ] ) on the density is achieved in the infinite - time limit for this sequential but _ unsaturated _ packing , which was pointed out only recently @xcite .",
    "although the limiting packing density @xmath3 is far from optimal in low dimensions , it is relatively large in high dimensions , as discussed in our concluding remarks .",
    "obviously , for any @xmath49 , the maximum ( infinite - time ) density of the generalized rsa packing is bounded from below by @xmath4 ( i.e. , the maximum density for @xmath41 ) . henceforth , we write @xmath50 .",
    "the derivation of the expression of @xmath51 is actually a simple extension of the aforementioned one for @xmath45 .",
    "two test spheres that arrive at times @xmath52 and @xmath53 and whose centers are separated by a distance @xmath54 can only be retained if no other test spheres arrived before @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ( see fig .",

    "it is useful to note that at small times or , equivalently , low densities , formula ( [ rho(t ) ] ) yields the asymptotic expansion @xmath67 , which when inverted yields @xmath68 .",
    "substitution of this last result into ( [ g2 - 2 ] ) gives @xmath69 which implies that @xmath70 tends to the unit step function @xmath71 as @xmath72 for any @xmath0 .    in the limit @xmath31",

    "mat ' ern originally gave an expression for the time - dependent density @xmath30 and and a formal expression ( as opposed to explicit expression for any @xmath0 ) for the time - dependent radial distribution function @xmath51 when @xmath41 using a completely different approach .",

    "these two asymptotic properties , which we have called the _ decorrelation principle _ @xcite , apply more generally to any disordered packing , as discussed in ref .",
    "asymptotically , unconstrained correlations vanish ( i.e. , statistical independence is established ) because we know from the kabatiansky and levenshtein asymptotic upper bound on the maximal density @xmath112 of any sphere packing that the density must go to zero at least as fast as @xmath113 for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the maximal density @xmath3 of the ghost rsa packing coincides with the greedy lower bound ( [ sat ] ) strongly suggests that there are saturated disordered packings that have larger densities , i.e. , the greedy lower bound is a weak bound for saturated packings @xcite .",
    "this implies that there may be disordered sphere packings in sufficiently high @xmath0 whose density exceeds minkowski s lower bound ( [ mink ] ) for bravais lattices , the dominant asymptotic term of which is @xmath4 .",
    "our results already give insight into this fascinating possibility .",
    "for example , consider the so - called checkerboard lattice @xmath114 in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite , which is a @xmath0-dimensional generalization of the optimal ( densest ) face - centered cubic lattice in three dimensions , and thought to be the optimal packing for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "the ratio of densities of the ghost rsa process to the checkerboard at @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "although both packings are unsaturated in such high dimensions , the fact that @xmath121 for the ghost rsa process is effectively uniform ( unity ) for all @xmath122 but for the checkerboard lattice involves dirac delta functions of _ weak _ strength at _ widely spaced _",
    "discrete distances explains why the former is enormously denser than the latter .    over the last century , many extensions and generalizations of minkowski s lower bound ( [ mink ] ) have been obtained @xcite , but none of these investigations have been able to improve upon the dominant exponential term @xmath13 . in another work @xcite",
    ", we will present comprehensive rigorous evidence that this exponential improvement may be provided by considering specific disordered sphere packings . here",
    "we simply sketch the procedure leading to this putative improvement over minkowski s lower bound .",
    "the basic ideas underlying our new approach to the derivation of lower bounds on @xmath112 were actually described in our earlier work @xcite in which we studied so - called @xmath110-invariant processes .",
    "a _ @xmath110-invariant process _",
    "is one in which a given nonnegative pair correlation @xmath123 function remains invariant for all @xmath124 over the range of densities @xmath125 the terminal density @xmath126 is the maximum achievable density for the @xmath110-invariant process subject to satisfaction of certain necessary conditions on the pair correlation .",
    "in particular , we considered those  test \" @xmath121 s that are distributions on @xmath1 depending only on the radial distance @xmath54 . for any test @xmath121",
    ", we want to maximize the corresponding density @xmath6 satisfying the following three conditions :        \\(iii ) @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the total correlation function . condition ( i ) is a trivial consequence of the fact that @xmath110 is a probability density function .",
    "condition ( ii ) is just the _ hard - core _ constraint for spheres of unit diameter .",
    "condition ( iii ) states that the structure factor @xmath131 in @xmath0 dimensions must be nonnegative for all @xmath132 .",
    "when there exist sphere packings with @xmath110 satisfying conditions ( i)-(iii ) for @xmath6 in the interval @xmath133 $ ] , then we have the lower bound on the maximal density given by @xmath134    it is rather remarkable that the optimization problem defined above is identical to one formulated by cohn @xcite . specifically , it is the _ dual _ of the _ primal _ infinite - dimensional linear program that cohn employed with elkies @xcite to obtain upper bounds on the maximal packing density .",
    "thus , even if there does not exist a sphere packing with @xmath110 satisfying conditions ( i)-(iii ) , the terminal density @xmath126 can never exceed the cohn - elkies upper bound and , more generally , our formulation has implications for upper bounds on @xmath112 .",
    "in addition , to the structure factor condition , there are generally many other conditions that a pair correlation function corresponding to a point process must obey @xcite .",
    "one such additional necessary condition , obtained by yamada @xcite , is concerned with the variance @xmath135 , in the number @xmath136 of particle centers contained within a region or  window \" @xmath137 : @xmath138 \\ge \\theta(1-\\theta ) , \\label{yamada}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the fractional part of the expected number of points @xmath140 contained in the window .",

    "as is the case with the yamada condition ( [ yamada ] ) , this additional necessary condition appears to lose relevance in low dimensions because we have shown that there is no analogous local geometric constraint violation for @xmath170 . for @xmath171",

    "we call this a conjectural lower bound because it relies on conjecture 1 being true , which a number of results support .",
    "first , the decorrelation principle states that unconstrained correlations in disordered sphere packings vanish asymptotically in high dimensions and that the @xmath20 for any @xmath111 can be inferred entirely from a knowledge of @xmath19 and @xmath110 .",
    "second , the necessary yamada condition appears to only have relevance in very low dimensions .",
    "third , we have demonstrated that other new necessary conditions also seem to be germane only in very low dimensions .",
    "fourth , we recover the form of known rigorous bounds [ cf .",

    "finally , in these two instances , configurations of disordered sphere packings on the torus have been numerically constructed with such @xmath110 in low dimensions for densities up to the terminal density @xcite .    a byproduct of the bound ( [ den ] ) is the conjectural asymptotic lower bound on the maximal kissing number @xcite @xmath175d/2}= 40.24850787 \\,d^{1/6 } \\ , 2^{0.2213475205\\ldots\\ , d},\\ ] ] this result is superior to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the maximal kissing number of @xmath176 @xcite .",
