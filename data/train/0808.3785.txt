    "the numerical and theoretical study of dynamical systems can resemble observational and experimental situations if the escape of an initial ensemble of trajectories through a leak placed in the otherwise closed phase space is considered .",
    "the idea of introducing a leak in a closed chaotic dynamical system to generate transient chaos was first suggested by pianigiani and yorke @xcite . later this problem was discussed in detail in the context of fractal exit boundaries @xcite , of geometrical acoustics @xcite , of quantum chaos @xcite , of controlling chaos @xcite , of resetting in hydrodynamical flows @xcite ,",
    "of leaked hamiltonian systems @xcite , of astronomy @xcite and of cosmology @xcite .",
    "the subject has recently received a renewed attention @xcite .",
    "part of this renewed interest comes from recent developments of quantum chaos , that started to consider carefully the effect of measurement devices , absorption , and other forms of leaking both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is by now clear that leaking dynamical systems provides a way to peeping at chaos @xcite , and can be used as a kind of chaotic spectroscopy @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "leaking systems provide an interesting bridge between open and closed dynamical systems . in closed systems",
    "the phase space coordinates remain confined , and a rigorous mathematical approach based on attractors and ergodic components can be employed @xcite .",
    "an important quantity is the distribution @xmath0 of the first poincar recurrence times  @xmath1 @xcite to a preselected region of the phase space . as originally proposed by chirikov and shepelyansky @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath0 is a useful analyser of the entire dynamics .",
    "in contrast , in open systems trajectories may leave the region of interest ( e.g. , tend to @xmath2 ) and the method of transient chaos is usually employed @xcite . in this case , the dynamics is characterized by the escape time distribution  @xmath3 ( the derivative of the survival probability ) .",
    "chaotic dynamics usually leads to an asymptotic exponential decay of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 for large enough @xmath7 .",
    "exponentials are the signature of _ strong _ chaotic properties as seen , e.g. , in the divergence of nearby initial conditions , in the decay of correlations , and in the convergence to equilibrium distributions .",
    "the exponent  @xmath8 is the key quantifier of system specific characteristics and will be considered in detail in this paper .",
    "the possibility of comparing a system with leak to its corresponding closed system shows numerous advantages in comparison to naturally opened systems .",
    "for instance , the rate  @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.exp ] ) can be estimated from the probability of escaping or returning . for small leaks ,",
    "this probability is obtained by computing the closed systems natural measure  @xmath9 of a typical leak region @xmath10 , and it follows that  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the mean recurrence or escape times , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .    despite its simplicity , relation  ( [ eq.smallmu ] ) is of little practical relevance since the limit @xmath15 is never achieved in either numerical or experimental applications  @xcite .",
    "here we do not restrict ourselves to this limit and find that , apart from being unrealistic , it masks different interesting relations .",
    "we perform a formal description through the theory of transient chaos , i.e. , in terms of a nonattracting chaotic set @xcite and the conditionally invariant measure  @xcite , and obtain distinct relations for  @xmath16 and @xmath17 as a function of the position and size of the region  @xmath10 and of the initial ensemble .",
    "relation  ( [ eq.smallmu ] ) does not hold , but we show that @xmath18 remains valid .",
    "this is based on a full correspondence with the recurrence problem obtained for a special initial ensemble and setting the _ leak to be equal to the recurrence region of the closed system_. we have explored the most striking consequences of this unified treatment from the point of view of poincar recurrences in a previous short paper  @xcite . here , after describing the relationship between the two problems with additional details , we focus on the escape problem and consider the recurrence problem as a particular , yet important , case .",
    "we also use this connection to apply and adapt a method to determine  @xmath16  @xcite based only on the escape probabilities for _ short _ times .",
    "this is a main advantage over genuine open systems where long - term periodic orbits are needed to determine  @xmath19 .    in systems showing",
    "_ weak _ chaos , as e.g. , hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space , the exponential decay law  ( [ eq.exp ] ) experiences a cross - over for longer times towards an asymptotic power - law behavior  @xcite .",
    "we argue , however , that on intermediate times a decay rate  @xmath16 can be well defined @xmath20 we interpret our results based on an effective splitting of the chaotic saddle into hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components .",

    "a consequence of ergodicity is kac s lemma @xcite : @xmath39 which is valid for any recurrence region  @xmath10 .",

    "( [ eq.smallmu ] ) .",
    "indeed , the poisson distribution is proved to describe deterministic hyperbolic systems ( see references in  @xcite ) .",

    "this will be theoretically justified in the next section and numerically illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec.henon ] .",
    "we are interested in the decay rate  @xmath41 , which typically deviates from the random estimate ( [ eq.gammamu ] ) , and also in the short time irregular fluctuations for  @xmath50 , where  @xmath49 is of the order of @xmath51 and will be better interpreted in sec .",
    "[ sec.rec ] .",
    "these short time irregular oscillations [ denoted as _ irregular _ in eq .",
    "( [ eq.prec ] ) and equations hereafter ] depend strongly on the choice of the recurrence region  @xmath10 .",

    "( [ eq.pesc ] ) .",
    "the average escape time , @xmath68 , also called the lifetime of chaos , is usually estimated by the reciprocal of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the exact average is , in general , different from @xmath69 and _ depends _ ( just like @xmath70 ) on @xmath71 .",
    "the ergodic theory of transient chaos explains the above properties by the existence of a non - attracting chaotic set .",
    "in invertible systems this set is , e.g. , a chaotic saddle : the set of orbits that never escape either forward or backward in time  @xcite . for systems with strong chaos ,",
    "the saddle is an invariant fractal set of zero measure .",
    "long - time transients correspond to trajectories that approach it closely , along its stable manifold , and leave it along its unstable manifold .",
    "being an invariant object , the chaotic saddle is , of course , independent of the initial density @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , assuming that the distribution  @xmath71 is non - vanishing in at least some region around the stable manifold of the saddle ( and that there are no disjoint saddles ) the escape rate  @xmath19 is _ independent _ of the initial density .",
    "it can be related to the geometrical and dynamical properties of the saddle by the kantz - grassberger formulas  @xcite , which for two - dimensional invertible maps are @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the positive ( negative ) lyapunov exponent on the saddle and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the information dimension of the saddle along its unstable ( stable ) manifold @xcite .",

    "<S> in order to simulate observational and experimental situations , we consider a leak in the phase space of a chaotic dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an expression for the escape rate of the survival probability applying the theory of transient chaos . </S>",
    "<S> this expression improves previous estimates based on the properties of the closed system and explains dependencies on the position and size of the leak and on the initial ensemble . with a subtle choice of the initial ensemble </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an equivalence to the classical problem of poincar recurrences in closed systems , which is treated in the same framework . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how our results apply to weakly chaotic systems and justify a split of the invariant saddle in hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components , related , respectively , to the intermediate exponential and asymptotic power - law decays of the survival probability . </S>"
