    "* r6 ) * - each instrument has 4 ics ( 4 quadrants ) .",
    "each ic can hold 15 masks and has a specific mechanical interface allowing it to be inserted in only one position on the instrument .",
    "the final design of the ics is not yet defined at the time of writing .",
    "a remotely controlled device moves the masks from the ics to the focal plane , and back .",
    "* r7 ) * - the manufactured mask must be temporarily stored in 2 storage cabinets ( one for each instrument ) waiting for the insertion in the ics or for the discarding .",
    "each sc is requested to contain 400 masks ( 100 mask - sets ) .",
    "in the initial concept , the mmm was a milling machine which would cut the slits in a 0.1 mm thin brass sheet supported by an aluminium frame .",
    "we assembled a small milling machine with a 3 axes displacement system and a high speed mandrel ( up to 80000 t / m ) .",
    "the minimum obtainable slit width was 300 @xmath1 m .",
    "because of the frames , the ics were large and quite heavy .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy in the slit positioning was hampered by the composition of errors due to the machine positioning accuracy , the interface error between the mask frame and the machine working platform , and between the mask frame and the focal plane .",
    "furthermore , because of the thermal expansion of brass it was difficult to meet the specification on positioning accuracy , given the temperature differences between the time a mask is manufactured and used in the instrument focal plane .",
    "subsequent developments were aimed at minimising the sources of errors , by making use of thicker ( but still @xmath0 0.3 mm ) al unframed masks , reducing the size and the weight of the ic and eliminating the manpower necessary to open the frames , remove the brass sheet and put in a new one .",
    "the next natural step was the use of a material with a very low thermal expansion coefficient like carbon fibre , kevlar , graphite or invar , but it was impossible to obtain the slit edge quality with the milling machine .",
    "it was only recently that a new type of laser cutting machines , called stencil lasers , became available on the market : these machines and one in particular were proven able to meet the specifications by making use of 0.2 mm thick invar sheets .",
    "the cutting speed made possible to cut the mask contour on the machine itself , and thus it can be customised to the quadrant interface where the mask will be placed , and , as a further bonus , also any slits width @xmath2 100 @xmath1 m became a possibility .",
    "for the milling technique the case of unframed aluminium masks has been considered for the comparison .",
    "a summary is shown here .",

    "+    _ slit edge quality _     + * milling : * the requested specifications can be reached but depend strongly on the material , the diameter of the cutting tool , the cutting speed , the raw mask fixing system .",

    "* milling : * the machine must be equipped with a high frequency mandrel , an automatic tool exchange mechanism , a tool checking system , a working platform with lubricating liquid tank and a cleaning unit to remove cutting oil . we have not found milling machines that completely meet our requirements on the market . a customisation is always necessary . + * laser : * laser machines meeting our requirements can be found on the market with integrated control systems .",
    "+    _ mask production rate _     + * milling : * about 15 minutes for the whole cycle .",

    "engineering costs must be added . + * laser : * the cost of a stencil laser cutting machine ranges from 530 ( lumonics ) to 630 ( lpkf ) kdm .",
    "a statement of work has been sent to 22 laser cutting machine manufacturers .",
    "11 companies answered our enquiry , 8 of which expressed their interest and 6 requested invar samples to try out their product .",
    "the most critical parameter to measure on test samples was the roughness of the slit edges .",
    "a first qualitative evaluation has always been done using a microscope from 50 @xmath7 to 500 @xmath7 , to check whether + @xmath8 the slit cuts show a regular pattern ( ripple ) or a random noisy profile + @xmath8 the laser cutting has left some residual or re - melted material + @xmath8 the black coating has been damaged + @xmath8 the nominal slit width and shape has been respected + a quantitative evaluation of the profile roughness has been done using a mechanical roughness meter .",
    "the results of the measures performed on the laser cutting samples provided by the manufacturers are summarised in table 1 .",
    "tests from lpkf and lumonics have been done with proprietary complete laser cutting machines , while other manufacturers have used their laser head with unspecified motion systems .",
    "table 1 - slit edge roughness measurements    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the mask manufacturing include , as the last operation , the cutting of the external border and thus the raw invar sheets must have bigger dimensions to allow for the mechanical fixing on the working platform of the laser cutting machine . a 340 by 450 mm sheet",
    "is presently adopted .",
    "the raw masks must be : +",
    "@xmath8 coated with a black anti - reflection paint + @xmath8 cut to the proper size + @xmath8 protected against scratches + @xmath8 packed to be shipped to paranal .",
    "+ the requested characteristics for the coating are : + @xmath8 thickness @xmath0 20 @xmath1 m + @xmath8 good adhesion to the metallic substrate + @xmath8 dull black color + @xmath8 uniformity of the coating over the 2 surfaces . + the mask yearly need for virmos is about 2400 .",
    "the aim of our work was to find a method to prepare a large quantity of raw masks at the lowest cost .",
    "the quotation of the 0.2 mm thick invar ( from krupp ) is approximately 25 dm / kg for quantities of at least 1000 kg .",
    "a 340 @xmath7 450 invar foil weighs 0.250 kg ; from 1000 kg of material about 4000 masks can be obtained .",
    "the cost of the material for a single mask is then about 6.3 dm .",
    "+ the invar material is delivered by krupp in rolls with the requested width ; the possible solutions to provide the raw masks are to cut the strip in foils and to varnish them , or to varnish the strip before cutting .",
    "we have tested both possibilities .",
    "the second method is the cheapest one and has been tested using a strip of stainless steel 450 mm wide .",
    "the process consists of : + @xmath8 chemical ( alkaline bath ) and mechanical ( brushing ) cleaning + @xmath8 coating of the two sides of the strip , using a roller system + @xmath8 warm curing of the varnish + @xmath8 insertion of a low adhesion plastic protective film + @xmath8 straightening to eliminate the roll curvature + @xmath8 cutting to the requested dimensions + @xmath8 piling of the raw masks on a transport pallet .",
    "+ the performed test has produced about 600 raw masks with good results from the point of view of the quality and of the adhesion of the coating , but the first and the last part of the strip must be discarded and the invar cost for a single mask becomes 7 dm .",
    "the cost of the whole coating process is about 6 dm per foil .",
    "so the total cost of a raw mask is 13 dm .",
    "the chosen solution for mask identification was the direct cutting of a 6 digit bar code on a border of the masks using the 2/5 interleaved code .",
    "it can be read by decoders during all the operations of the mask handling system .",
