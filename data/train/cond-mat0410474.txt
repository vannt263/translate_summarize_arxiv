    "recently , a frhlich hamitonian was studied on a two - dimensional , discrete , quadratic @xcite , respectively hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the interaction of an excitation field such as an amide i- vibration in biopolymers or an electron ( in the case of the frhlich hamiltonian ) with a lattice whose distortion can be caused by this excitation results in the creation of a localised state which , in what follows , we refer to as a soliton .",
    "such a soliton was first introduced by davydov @xcite in the 1970s to explain the dispersion free energy transport in biopolymers ( see also @xcite for further details ) . in @xcite , the existence of such solitons was studied numerically and it was found that their properties depended crucially on the magnitude of the electron - phonon coupling constant . in particular , localised 2-dimensional structures exist only above a critical value of this coupling .",
    "these numerical results have been confirmed by a simple analytic argument : using a gaussian in 2 dimensions , we can approximate very well this critical value .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the results for the soliton on a hexagonal lattice @xcite and look at the properties of the solitons close to the critical coupling .",
    "we find that close to this critical coupling , three types of solutions exist : the `` narrow '' 2-dimensional solitons , discussed in @xcite , `` broad '' 2-dimensional solitons , which extend over much bigger parts of the lattice than the former , and one - dimensional solitons .",
    "since our model is a toy - model for solitons on nanotubes , these latter configuartions can be interpreted as ring - like solitonic structures around the tube .    in section",
    "ii we present our equations and in section iii we discuss the results of our numerical investigations .",
    "the equations describing an electron field interacting with a deformable hexagonal lattice were derived in @xcite .",
    "these equations read : @xmath0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the electron field and @xmath1 @xmath2 for the displacement fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the @xmath5- and , respectively , @xmath6-direction . @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 index the points in @xmath5- , respectively @xmath6-directions .    for the corresponding hamiltonian and the appropriate rescalings , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath9 is the self - coupling constant of the displacement fields and @xmath10 is the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "@xmath11 is the phonon energy , while @xmath12 was chosen to be @xmath13 in our numerical investigations .",
    "we have normalised the electron - function @xmath14 to one , i.e. @xmath15 thus assuming the excitation to be one excess electron .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the number of lattice points in @xmath5- , respectively @xmath6-directions .",
    "in this paper , we present new results on a model describing the interaction of one excess electron with a 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice .",
    "this model was studied first in @xcite .",
    "before we discuss our new results , let us summarize the results of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was found that 2-dimensional solitonic structures which are created due to the interaction between the distortions of the hexagonal lattice ( `` phonons '' ) and the electron field on this lattice ( `` excess electron '' ) , exist only when the electron - phonon coupling is large enough .",
    "this numerical result was also found in the case of the quadratic lattice @xcite and thus seems to be a generic feature of 2-dimensional lattices . for values of the coupling constant smaller than some critical value @xmath18 ,",
    "the interaction between the lattice and the electron ( exciton ) field becomes too small for 2-dimensional solitonic structures to exist . in this paper",
    ", we present new results on the behaviour of the system close to this critical value @xmath18 .",
    "we have confirmed that `` narrow '' , i.e. well pronounced 2-dimensional solitons exist for @xmath19 . a typical solution of this type is shown in fig . [ fignew1 ] for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "= 12.0 cm +    clearly the probability density @xmath22 is localised only on a small portion of the lattice . for @xmath23 $ ] ,",
    "a broad two - dimensional soliton appears ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , while decreasing the value of @xmath10 further leads to a configuration in which the soliton becomes effectively one - dimensional .",
    "a typical one - dimensional configuration is shown in fig.[fignew2 ] .",
    "= 12.0 cm +    as is obvious from this figure , for small @xmath10 , the function @xmath24 becomes effectively independent of the @xmath6-direction and we see @xmath17 copies of the function @xmath25 . while for @xmath26 , we expect the solitonic structure to be effectively fixed to one point on the lattice , thus @xmath27 , the threshold of our one - dimensional soliton is characterised by the value of @xmath28 , which can be obtained for the last possible `` broad '' soliton divided by the number @xmath17 . in our case @xmath21 and the last value of the broad soliton @xmath29 , so we would expect solitons with heights on the order of @xmath30 . indeed , for @xmath31 , we find solitons with heights of @xmath32 , which confirms our interpretation .",
    "we plot the @xmath10 dependence of the value of @xmath28 in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "clearly , we note the familiar structure of the curve , especially , we notice that at @xmath33 , the value of @xmath28 becomes constant and is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "this is not surprising since this is just the value where @xmath35 , i.e. the field is completely delocalised , i.e. it is equally distributed over the whole grid .    the fact that the one - soliton ceases to exist is , however , related to the number @xmath17 . in principle",
    ", one - d solitons should exist for all values of @xmath36 .",
    "of course , this value was derived for @xmath37 . to study the dependence on @xmath17",
    ", we have looked at the dependence of the critical value of @xmath10 , @xmath38 at which the one - d soliton becomes equally distributed over the grid , i.e. @xmath39 . the values are listed in table i.    .dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath17 for @xmath20 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     = 12.0 cm +    we notice that the value @xmath38 decreases with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath41 represents the normalisation of the electron field function in the @xmath5-direction , i.e. of the one - d soliton for one fixed @xmath6 , this means that the `` bigger '' the one - d soliton is the lower is the critical value of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we can understand this behaviour by observing that by scaling the @xmath14 field in our equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) such that @xmath42 we obtain the equations for a system with a normalization of the @xmath14 fields corresponding to the one - d solitons .",
    "we notice that this rescaling is nothing else but the rescaling of the coupling constant @xmath43 . following this argument",
    ", the product @xmath44 should thus be constant .",
    "looking at table i , we indeed find that @xmath45 .",
    "= 12.0 cm +    we have also plotted the corresponding energies of the solutions .",
    "these are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "note that the configurations with equally distributed @xmath14 would have an energy @xmath46 .",
    "the energies of the soliton solutions are clearly below this value .",
    "the energy of a narrow soliton is the lowest energy configuration as long as the coupling constant is above the value at which one - d solitons can exist .",
    "then , these one - d solitons have the lowest energy .",
    "note that the broad soliton never becomes the lowest energy configuration and so appears to be unstable .",
    "in this short note we have reported results of our studies of an electron phonon system on a hexagonal lattice which was longer in one direction than the other ( i.e. with a larger number of lattice points in the @xmath5-direction - @xmath16 than in the @xmath6-direction i.e. @xmath17 ) .",
    "we have looked at the values of the electron - phonon coupling constant at which the system possesses soliton - like solutions . we have found that `` genuine '' two - dimensional solitons , like those studied in @xcite , exist for the coupling constant larger than some critical value .",
    "for the values of the constant close to this critical value the system possess another solution - which corresponds to a `` broad '' soliton .",
    "this new solution appears to be unstable .",
    "when the coupling constant is below its critical value the two - dimensional soliton is so `` broad '' that it can be interpreted as an effective one - dimensional structure .",
    "as the value of the coupling decreases further the `` one - dimensional '' soliton becomes broader and , below some new critical value , it spreads over the whole lattice leading to complete delocalisation .    the value at which this happens depends on the size of the lattice .",
    "however , this is not surprising as for an effective one - dimensional soliton the normalisation of the electron field plays an important role ( the soliton is normalised on the two - dimensional lattice and so the field of the effective one - dimensional soliton is normalised to @xmath47 , where @xmath17 describes the number of points in the `` shorter '' direction ) .",
    "a simple scaling argument then explains the observed @xmath17 dependence of the critical value of the electron - phonon coupling constant for the existence of one - dimensional solitons .",
    "though our investigations were performed only for the 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice , we would expect that similar features appear in the case of other lattice structures , i.e. lattices in physical three dimensional spaces , the quadratic lattices of @xcite etc .",
