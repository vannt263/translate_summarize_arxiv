    "ever since cheeger s celebrated study of the spectral invariants of singular spaces @xcite there has been a great deal of research to extend our understanding of geometric analysis from smooth spaces .",
    "index theory in particular has been extended to spaces with isolated conic singularities quite successfully ( beyond the papers of cheeger see , e.g. , @xcite ) and was used by bismut and cheeger to establish their families index theorem on manifolds with boundary @xcite .",
    "the fact that bismut and cheeger used , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.5 ) , is that for a dirac operator ( though not any dirac - type operator ) on a space with a conic singularity , the null space of @xmath0 sections naturally corresponds to the null space of the dirac operator on the manifold with boundary obtained by excising the singularity and imposing the ` atiyah - patodi - singer boundary condition ' @xcite , provided an induced dirac operator on the link has no kernel .",
    "indeed cheeger points out in @xcite that one can recover the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem from the index formula for spaces with conic singularities .    in this paper",
    "we consider a dirac operator on a space with non - isolated conic singularities , also known as an ` incomplete edge space ' , and the dirac operator on the manifold with boundary obtained by excising a tubular neighborhood of the singularity and imposing the atiyah - patodi - singer boundary condition .",
    "although the relation between the domains of these two dirac operators is much more complicated than in the case of isolated conic singularities , we show that under a  geometric witt assumption \" analogous to that used by bismut - cheeger , the index of these operators coincide .",
    "thus we obtain a formula for the index of the dirac operator on the singular space as the ` adiabatic limit ' of the index of the dirac operator with atiyah - patodi - singer boundary conditions .",
    "+    [ fig : geometric ]    specifically , an incomplete edge space is a stratified space @xmath1 with a single singular stratum @xmath2 in keeping with melrose s paradigm for analysis on singular spaces ( see e.g. , @xcite ) we resolve @xmath1 by ` blowing - up ' @xmath3 and obtain a smooth manifold with boundary @xmath4 whose boundary is the total space of a fibration of smooth manifolds @xmath5 a ( product - type ) incomplete edge metric is a metric that , in a collar neighborhood of the boundary , takes the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 a defining function for @xmath8 @xmath9 a metric on @xmath3 and @xmath10 a family of two - tensors that restrict to a metric on each fiber of @xmath11 thus we see that metrically the fibers of the boundary fibration are collapsed , as they are in @xmath12    we also replace the cotangent bundle of @xmath13 by a bundle adapted to the geometry , the ` incomplete edge cotangent bundle ' @xmath14 , see below .",
    "this bundle is locally spanned by forms like @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the main difference with the usual cotangent bundle is that the form @xmath18 is a non - vanishing section of @xmath14 all the way to @xmath19    we assume that @xmath20 is spin and denote a spin bundle on @xmath13 by @xmath21 and the associated dirac operator by @xmath22 the operator @xmath23 does not induce an operator on the boundary in the usual sense , due to the degeneracy of the metric there , but we do have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a vertical family of dirac operators on @xmath19 it turns out , as in the conic case mentioned above , and the analogous study of the signature operator in @xcite , that much of the functional analytic behavior of @xmath23 is tied to that of @xmath26 indeed , in section [ sec : proofofessential ] below we prove the following theorem .",

    "it is important to note that the analogous statement for an arbitrary dirac - type operator is _ false _ and the general index formula requires an extra contribution from the singularity .",
    "we will return to this in a subsequent publication .",
    "we also point out to the reader that there exist other derivations of index formulas on manifolds with structured ends in which the computation is reduced to taking a limit in the atiyah - patodi - singer index formula ; see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "+ one very interesting aspect of the spin dirac operator is its close relation to the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics .",
    "most directly , the lichnerowicz formula shows that the index of the dirac operator is an obstruction to the existence of such a metric .",

    "as described above , but removing this assumption would only result in slightly more intricate computations below .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : essential ] follows the arguments employed in @xcite to prove the analogous result for the signature operator .",
    "thus we start with the two canonical closed extensions of @xmath23 from @xmath68 namely @xmath69 where the convergence in the second definition is in @xmath70 and we show that under assumption , these domains coincide @xmath71 since @xmath23 is a symmetric operator , this shows that it is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "one difference between the case of isolated conic singularities ( @xmath72 ) and the general incomplete edge case is that in the former , even if assumption does not hold , @xmath73 is a finite dimensional space . in contrast , when @xmath74 this space is generally infinite - dimensional .",
    "we prove by constructing a parametrix @xmath75 for @xmath23 in section [ sec : parametrix ] . from the mapping properties of @xmath75",

    "the relationship between the mapping properties of @xmath75 and the stated conclusions can be seen largely through below , which states that the maximal domain has ` extra ' vanishing , i.e.  sections in @xmath77 lie in weighted spaces @xmath78 with weight @xmath79 higher than generically expected .",
    "this shows that the inclusion of the domain into @xmath0 is a compact operator , which in particular gives that the kernel of @xmath23 on the maximal domain is finite dimensional .",
