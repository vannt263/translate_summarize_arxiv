    "we theoretically investigate an extension of the dicke model . here , three - level systems in @xmath0-configuration are considered , which are coupled to two independent scalar bosonic modes .",

    "a similar behavior is anticipated in the extended model .    in analogy to the dicke model , here exist two symmetry operators    @xmath31    which commute with the hamiltonian  .",
    "these operators have the physical meaning of _ parity operators _ and have eigenvalues @xmath32 . the operator @xmath33 in the exponent of the parity operator   is related to the number of excitations in the blue ( @xmath34 ) or in the red ( @xmath35 ) branch of the @xmath0-system and the number of excitations in the corresponding @xmath22th bosonic mode , respectively .",

    "it is the parity which is spontaneously broken in the superradiant phase of the dicke model .",
    "thus , we expect that at least _ one _ of the parities is also spontaneously broken in our model .    using the definition   of the operators @xmath19",
    ", one can show that the two sets of operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 fulfill the angular momentum algebra respectively , i.e. they are generators of the special unitary group su(2 ) and can be understood as angular momentum operators .",

    "it is known , that the generators of the group u(n ) can be represented by either n or by @xmath41 independent bosons  @xcite .",

    "the dicke model was introduced in 1954  @xcite . to date",
    "there exists no exact analytical solution to this model for a finite number @xmath8 of particles .",
    "however , the dicke hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the already mentioned holstein  primakoff transformation . in this article",
    "we apply a generalized version of the holstein  primakoff transformation to diagonalize the hamiltonian   of the @xmath0-system .      in the present paper",

    "the meaning of the state @xmath49 and which of the n states can be used as a reference state will be elucidated later .",

    "in addition , the number of hp bosons in all @xmath41 modes does not exceed @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath56 .",

    "this means that @xmath61 is related to the creation of excitations with energy @xmath59 , which is the energy separation of the single - particle energy levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
