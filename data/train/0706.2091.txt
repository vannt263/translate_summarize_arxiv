    "<S> since the experimental data from na49 @xcite and from ceres @xcite collaborations overlap at beam energies @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47a gev , we show the calculations and data with respect to ceres energies separately as dashed - dotted lines and open symbols .    </S>",

    "<S> meanwhile , with increasing beam energies , the splitting of @xmath9 with different @xmath83 becomes stronger , which can be attributed to the flow - dominated freeze - out scenario . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is also in line with previous results @xcite , where it was found that the decrease of @xmath9 with increasing @xmath83 at rhic energies is stronger for central reactions than for peripheral ones . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be noted that the small @xmath83 behaviour of the correlation function is also affected by some other factors , such as the decay of resonances , potential interactions and/or the treatment of resonance life - times and widths in the medium .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) shows the calculations on @xmath10 in comparison to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> here we find that model calculation in data agree fairly well at ags and sps - na49 but deviations from data are observable at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison to the ceres data ( with the appropriate cuts ) however shows a rather large discrepancy between calculation and data . </S>",
    "<S> this deviations was also report in a previous study @xcite and might hint to systematic differences ( apart from different experimental centralities and cuts ) between the na49 analysis and the results measured by the ceres collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> the source of this difference remains therefore unclear . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the na57 collaboration published the @xmath84 dependence of the hbt radii ( with @xmath84 up to @xmath85 gev@xmath71 ) in pb+pb collisions at @xmath45a gev , and it was found that the na57-data , especially the @xmath10 , are in line with the na49-data @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( c ) , we notice that the calculated sideward radii @xmath11 are in qualitative agreement with the data but seem to be 15% smaller for almost all energies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the increase of the measured @xmath11 at low ags energies can not be reproduced @xcite and might be due to the omission of potential interactions that gain importance at low beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> detailed investigations will be presented in a future publication . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation function of the hbt radii from several systems ( from light to heavy ) inspired by the na49-future collaboration @xcite might also provide new insights into this problem , and predictions are in progress .    the hbt duration time  puzzle  </S>",
    "<S> , i.e. the fact of the theoretical quantity @xmath13 being larger than extracted from the data , is present at all investigated energies ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ( d ) ) : the calculated values of @xmath13 are about @xmath86  fm while the measured ones are @xmath87  fm . </S>",
    "<S> many efforts have been put forward over the last years to clarify this issue @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , in our previous works @xcite , we suggested that a sizeable amount of interactions between particles at the early stage of the reaction either on the mean field and/or ( non - perturbative ) partonic level seem to be relevant to understand the phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , all straightforward cascade transport approaches ( also those with partonic interactions with perturbative qcd cross sections ) fail to describe the quantity @xmath13 , as well as the elliptic flow @xcite , over the whole energy range .     </S>",

    "<S> the experimental value for @xmath14 at @xmath88  gev is obtained with the help of recent @xmath89 data in @xcite , at all other energies the @xmath14 data are taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows the excitation function of the pion source volume @xmath3 at freeze - out , calculated as @xcite @xmath90 note that the radius @xmath10 is not considered to calculate the pion freeze - out volume since it contains the contribution of the temporal extent of the pion source . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows clearly that the urqmd cascade calculations do provide a reasonable freeze - out volume for the pion source at rhic energies . at sps energies , the agreement is fine with ceres data while it slightly underpredicts those of na49 . towards even lower energies , </S>",
    "<S> the model underpredicts the measured freeze - out volume due to the omission of the strong interaction potential and other in - medium effects . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. at @xmath91 gev , the measured @xmath3 is about @xmath92 times larger than calculated value . as studied in @xcite , a mass - dependent lifetime of resonances </S>",
    "<S> accounts for an improvement of the hbt - radii at small @xmath83 and hence reproduce the data better . from the discussions above , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the major part of this difference is related to the sideward radius @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to estimate the mean free path @xmath14 of the pions at freeze - out from the following expression @xcite @xmath93 with the averaged pion - nucleon cross section @xmath94  mb and the averaged pion - pion cross section @xmath95  mb ( note that within the present model calculations these values are slightly energy dependent . however , </S>",

    "<S> recent calculations using the present urqmd transport model @xcite , have shown that the calculated pion and nucleon yields are reasonably in agreement with data .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) shows the excitation function of @xmath14 of pions at freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the theoretical @xmath14 value increases gradually from @xmath112 to @xmath113  fm from ags to highest rhic energies with a weak dependence on @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values of @xmath14 are also between @xmath114  fm . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath14 below the ags energy deviates from the data due to the smaller calculated sideward radii ( resulting in a too small freeze - out volume ) .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , the assumption of a constant kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath100  mev in the calculations of @xmath101 over the whole energy range is not justified , especially for the collisions at low beam energies . by inserting an energy dependent temperature ( assuming a kinetic freeze - out temperature of 70% of the chemical freeze - out temperature shown in @xcite ) into eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nn1 ] and [ npi1 ] , one finds that at lower ags energies , the number of nucleons and pions in the pion source volume is visibly reduced due to the decreased @xmath102 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 increases and a flatter distribution of @xmath14 as a function of the beam energy is obtained in the present calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation ( both experimentally and theoretically ) of a nearly energy independent mean free path on the order of @xmath115  fm at pion freeze - out is rather surprising . </S>",
    "<S> physically it has been interpreted as a rather large opaqueness of the pion source at break - up @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we survey the excitation function of the hbt radii @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , the quantity @xmath13 , the volume @xmath3 , and the mean free path @xmath14 of pions at freeze - out for heavy systems with energies ranging from lowest ags to the highest rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the model calculations with urqmd v2.2 ( cascade mode ) are in line with the data over the whole inspected energy range . although discrepancies especially in the lower ags energy region are found and have to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> especially the hbt parameter @xmath11 and the hbt duration - time related `` puzzle '' deserve further attention . </S>",
    "<S> finally we re - interpret the measured and calculated radii in terms of a mean free path for pions and kinetic freeze - out . here </S>",
    "<S> we find a nearly constant mean free path for pions on the order of @xmath116  fm indicating a significant opaqueness of the source . </S>"
