    "non - equilibrium many body theory or quantum field theory has become a major topic of research for describing various transport processes in nuclear physics , in cosmological particle physics or more generally in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "a very powerful diagrammatic tool is given by the ` schwinger - keldysh ' @xcite or ` closed time path ' ( ctp ) technique by means of non - equilibrium green s functions for describing a quantum system also beyond thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "for an equilibrium situation this technique is equivalent to the real time description of finite temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations of motion ( by various approximations ) , the so called kadanoff - baym equations @xcite , have to be considered as an ensemble average over the initial density matrix @xmath1 characterizing the preparation of the initial state of the system .",
    "typically , if the system is close to thermal equilibrium , the ( initial or resulting ) density matrix allows for thermal fluctuations which should be inherent to the transport process under consideration .",
    "if fluctuations are physically present in the course of the evolution , then , according to the famous fluctuation - dissipation theorem , also dissipation must be present . or ,",
    "in turn , if the ( quantum ) system behaves dissipatively , as a consequence , there must exist fluctuations .",
    "again , the kadanoff - baym equations have to be understood as an ensemble averaging over all the possible fluctuations . accordingly",
    ", there should be a stochastic component inherent to these transport processes .",
    "this inherent stochastic aspect of the kadanoff - baym equations is what we want to point out in detail below",
    ". an important ingredient to these equations and thus to the one - particle propagator will consist of the ensemble average over ` noise ' fluctuations",
    ".    it might well be that some or most of our conclusions are already known and can be found in various studies .",
    "however , we feel that there exists no clear and thorough study which contains all the points we will present in the following .",
    "we believe that our investigation can give some new physical insight on the structure of the kadanoff - baym equations .    as a primary intention and motivation for our further study",
    "let us make a seemingly jump by reviewing the description of ( classical ) brownian motion .",
    "( the intimate connection of ` quantum brownian motion ' to the structure of the kadanoff - baym equations will be the basic outcome . ) a heavy particle with mass @xmath2 is placed in a thermal environment of fast moving particles ( being much lighter , i.e.  their masses @xmath3 ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the heavy particle can then phenomenologically be described by means of a standard langevin equation : @xmath4 here @xmath5 describes the ( stokes ) damping coefficient resulting from the average interaction with the lighter particles .",
    "@xmath6 is the random ( langevin ) force ( or ` noise ' ) exerted by the surrounding medium ( the ` heat bath ' ) , the external agencies .",
    "since this random force @xmath6 represents instantaneous effects of interactions ( i.e.  collisions ) with many particles , it is plausible that @xmath7 is a stochastic force with a _ gaussian _",
    "distribution having an average of zero .",
    "it seems worthwhile to point out the specific nature of such a stochastic equation of motion : the stochastic force term makes the trajectory @xmath8 a stochastic quantity as well .",
    "thus , to any possible ensemble @xmath9 we get a corresponding ensemble @xmath10 . the physical description of the system @xmath8 results from piling up such trajectories .",
    "this means that we have to deal with ensembles of stochastic trajectories @xmath11 instead of one trajectory @xmath12 , as it would be the case for the solution of a deterministic equation of motion .",
    "further , one typically assumes that @xmath7 possesses an infinitely short time correlation ( which physically corresponds to a clear separation among the time scales of relaxation of the heavy particle and the light particles ) , i.e.  that it is a markovian process and the noise being white .",
    "@xmath7 is thus completely characterized by the following moments @xmath13 @xmath14 labels the average over all possible realizations of the stochastic variable @xmath6 .",
    "all higher moments follow as a factorization of ` truncated ' second moments and a sum over all possible permutations from the property of the ( assumed ) gaussian distribution .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath5 and the random force @xmath6 have the _ same _ microscopic origin .",
    "in fact , it turns out that there is a relation between them , called the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ ( fdt ) @xcite .",
    "( such a relation will explicitly shown to exist within the ctpgf approach . ) as a motivation for its microscopic existence , one should recall that for long times the average energy of the heavy particle should become @xmath15 .    the explicit solution of ( [ lang1 ] ) is readily found to read ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 so that with ( [ bmnoise ] ) one has @xmath18 and thus the desired connection follows as @xmath19 the strength of the noise distribution @xmath20 is related to the friction coefficient @xmath5 , which is a rather simple version of the fdt .",
    "( such a relation is often been referred in the literature as the second fdt . )",
    "the microscopic derivation of the friction @xmath5 and of the residual random force @xmath6 is a longstanding problem of statistical mechanics . for a rather clear presentation and derivation for a classical as well as quantum mechanical system",
    "we refer to the article by cortes et al .",
    "one can also convince oneself that the higher moments @xmath21 turn out to be the one for a free particle with a canonical distribution , i.e. @xmath22 with @xmath23 this follows immediately by making use of the gaussian distribution and the resulting factorization of the higher moments .",
    "if there exists a clear separation among the time scales of the slow heavy particle and the fast light particles , a markovian langevin equation with white noise can be considered as being appropriate . however",
    ", this might not truly be the case for various applications like in nuclear physics @xcite . in our later field theoretical discussion",
    "the markov assumption is too restrictive .",
    "we are thus forced to generalize the above langevin equation ( [ lang1 ] ) to allow for finite memory , i.e.  retarded friction .",
    "it reads @xmath24 ( the markov approximation is thus obtained if @xmath25 . )",
    "we have shifted the lower bound of the integration to @xmath26 which is valid for the discussion of the long - time behavior .",
    "tacitly we assume that the friction kernel @xmath27 is ` well behaved ' ( meaning that its fourier transform @xmath28 ) and has only some finite extension in time .",
    "on the other hand , in the ( semi-)classical regime @xcite the time correlation of the stochastic force follows as @xmath29 a noise correlation being non - local ( i.e. not white ) is called colored noise .    to see that this relation is still in accordance with the equipartition condition @xmath30",

    "this follows rigorously from cauchy s theorem in the extended complex plane by making use of the analytic properties of the respective propagators and assuming @xmath43 , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 . )",
    "hence , irrespective of the detailed form of the friction kernel @xmath46 , the equipartition condition is automatically fulfilled as long as the noise kernel @xmath47 fulfills the relation ( [ bmnoise1 ] ) .",
    "after this somewhat lengthy discussion of classical brownian motion we now want to return to quantum field theory and already point out some similarities .",
    "one of the major topics in quantum field theory at finite temperature or near thermal equilibrium concerns the evolution and behavior of the long wavelength modes .",
    "these often lie entirely in the non - perturbative regime",
    ". therefore solutions of the classical field equations in minkowski space have been widely used in recent years to describe long - distance properties of quantum fields that require a non - perturbative analysis ( for some applications see references cited in @xcite ) .",
    "a justification of the classical treatment of the long - distance dynamics of bosonic quantum fields at high temperature is based on the observation that the average thermal amplitude of low - momentum modes is large . for a weakly coupled quantum field",
    "the occupation number of a mode with wave vector @xmath48 and frequency @xmath49 is given by the bose distribution @xmath50 for temperatures @xmath51 much higher than the ( dynamical ) mass scale @xmath52 of the quantum field , the occupation number for the low - momentum modes @xmath53 becomes large and approaches the classical equipartition limit @xmath54 the classical field equations ( which can be understood as a coherent state approximation to the full quantum field theory ) should provide a good approximation for the dynamics of such highly occupied modes . however , the thermodynamics of a classical field can only be defined if a 3-dimensional ultraviolet cut - off @xmath55 is imposed on the momentum @xmath56 such as a finite lattice spacing @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , the long wavelength modes do still interact with the short wavelength modes ( of the scale of the temperature ) .",
    "in a recent paper of one of us @xcite it was shown how to construct an effective semi - classical action for describing not only the classical behavior of the long wavelength modes below some given cutoff @xmath55 , but taking into account also perturbatively the interaction among the soft and hard modes . by integrating out the ` influence ' of the hard modes on the two - loop level for standard @xmath58-theory",
    "the emerging semi - classical equations of motion for the soft fields become stochastic equations of motion of langevin type : @xmath59 resembling the analogous expression to eqs .",
    "( [ lang1 ] ) and ( [ lang2 ] ) . splitting @xmath60 into real and imaginary parts it follows that the ( onshell ) damping rate in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath61 being responsible for dissipation .",
    "in addition , also the noise correlation function as the analogue to ( [ bmnoise1 ] ) follows microscopically @xmath62 .",
    "we will see how this works in detail below .",
    "the hard modes thus act as a heat bath .",
    "they also guarantee that the soft modes become , on average , thermally populated with the same temperature as that of the heat bath .",
    "equivalently to ( [ equi1 ] ) we will see that a similar relation exists for the average fluctuation of the amplitude squared . for the semi - classical regime",
    "where @xmath63 it will take the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 describes the fourier transform of the time correlation function of the noise distribution and @xmath66 is the volume of the system .",
    "such kind of langevin description for the propagation of long wavelength modes in non abelian gauge theories has recently been proposed by huet and son @xcite to be used in the context of cosmological baryogenesis .",
    "the derivation of the effective stochastic equation of motion has been carried out by means of the influence functional approach of feynman and vernon @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to integrate out ( perturbatively ) to some order ( typically quadratic ) the heat bath degrees of freedom and thus obtain an effective action for the system degrees of freedom .",
    "one can explicitly see how dissipation and noise occurs and how the fdt emerges from a purely microscopic point of view .",
    "in fact , the idea of employing the feynman and vernon functional approach was used quite early to derive an effective langevin equation for quantum brownian motion @xcite .",
    "one can also formulate the effect of the heat bath on the evolution of the system degrees of freedom by means of the ctpgf technique .",
    "the main success of the ctpgf formalism lies in its ` usefulness ' obeying strictly diagrammatic rules so that higher order contributions ( i.e.  diagrams ) can , in principle , be straightforwardly calculated ( in analogy to the matsubara rules ) . in the ctpgf formalism , however , only the ensemble averaged characteristic of expectation values is obtained ( as we will see ) .",
    "in fact , one can think of the individual stochastic trajectories being sampled and averaged over the influence of noise .",
    "this is what we want to discuss in depth .",
    "the equivalence of both approaches has indeed been pointed out already in @xcite on a quite formal level .",
    "however , we believe that our discussion is inspired on more physical intuition and thus hopefully provides some new insight on the dissipative and _ stochastic _ character of the ctpgf approach .    in the following we discuss both approaches for a free scalar field theory interacting ( perturbatively ) with a heat bath . in the next section we review the ctpgf technique and",
    "evaluate the average characteristic properties of the ctp propagator resulting from the ( non - equilibrium ) equations of motion , the kadanoff - baym equations .",
    "we obtain the feynman - vernon approach by a rather simple rearrangement of the interaction kernels stemming from the heat bath . with this , of course , the equivalence has already been shown .",
    "we identify the dynamically generated mass shift , dissipation and fluctuation terms and show that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem emerges naturally and is thus stated in microscopic terms . in the third section the ( quantum ) noise distribution and its ( in this case gaussian ) distribution will be introduced . with this at hand",
    "we analyze the ` noisy ' propagator for a given noise sequence and then explicitly show that when averaging over the noise fluctuation , the ctp propagator results naturally .",
    "we thus can point out the inherent meaning of the noise correlation function on the propagator and on the ctp description . in section [ sec : bollan ] an attempt will be undertaken to derive an effective boltzmann - langevin equation for the phase - space occupation number of the bosonic particles . in this respect ,",
    "we first show that the noise drives also the thermal fluctuations in the occupation number .",
    "we comment on the interpretational difficulties of the effective equation and on the quantum aspects of noise . as a byproduct of our study",
    "we also see how so called pinch singularities do emerge in a strictly perturbative sense and how this problem is cured naturally in this case ( our approach for the system degrees of freedom is non - perturbative in the sense that the perturbative contribution ( the ` influence ' ) of the bath is resummed by a dyson - schwinger equation ) .",

    "hence , for any system which moves towards thermal equilibrium and thus behaves dissipatively , the _ full _ propagator must have some finite width ( due to collisions or more generally due to damping ) .",

    "the initial out - of - equilibrium distribution @xmath459 can not stay constant during the evolution of the system as it has to evolve towards the bose distribution . if @xmath467 is of order @xmath468 , it is obvious that there must exist contributions which perturbatively attribute to the temporal change of the distribution function and contribute to the same order as the one with employing ( [ d < noneq ] ) .",

    "@xcite , we now see that the resummation would simply result in exchanging @xmath459 by @xmath469 given by ( [ nsig ] ) : @xmath470 it should be clear by now that this ` change ' stems in part from the temporal evolution of the distribution function .",
    "one can also interpret the substitution ( [ change ] ) as the change of the distribution dictated by the self energy operator ( containing damping ) .",

    ", they had demonstrated that during the quench of a second order chiral phase transition the soft pion fields become highly populated and can be described by their classical equation of motions . on the other hand , these soft pion modes still do interact with the thermal environment which was not taken into account ( even classically ) in @xcite due to the finite resolution of the employed spatial lattice . to account for their interaction",
