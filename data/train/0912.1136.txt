    "classical novae are a thermonuclear runaway event on a white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system , in which the wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter from the companion star .",
    "when the accreted matter reaches a critical value , hydrogen at the bottom of the wd envelope ignites to trigger a shell flash ( denoted by time @xmath15 ) . just after a nova outburst",
    ", the envelope on the wd rapidly expands to a giant size and optically thick winds blow .",
    "the wd envelope settles in a steady - state .",
    "the optical magnitude attains the peak at the maximum expansion of the photosphere ( time @xmath16 ) .",
    "then the photosphere gradually shrinks whereas the total luminosity is almost constant during the outburst .",
    "thus , the photospheric temperature @xmath17 increases with time .",
    "the main emitting wavelength region moves from optical to ultraviolet and finally to supersoft x - ray , corresponding to from @xmath18  k through @xmath19  k. the optically thick winds blow continuously from the very beginning of the outburst until the photospheric temperature increases to @xmath20  ( k)@xmath21 .",
    "just when the optically thick wind stops ( time @xmath22 ) , the temperature quickly rises and the supersoft x - ray phase starts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , classical novae become a transient supersoft x - ray source in a later phase of the outburst , but their x - ray detection is rather rare mainly because of sparse observing time of x - ray satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a formula to predict a supersoft x - ray phase of novae , we can plan more efficient observation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose such a formula .",
    "novae show a rich variety of light curves ; the timescales of decline , shapes , and total durations of outbursts are very different from nova to nova .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to predict a later supersoft x - ray phase only from the early optical light curve .",
    "recently we have proposed the universal decline law of classical novae @xcite , i.e. , there is a basic light curve which can basically follow ( or overlap with ) individual nova light curves by squeezing or stretching it in the direction of time .",
    "we call this `` a universal decline law . ''",
    "the universal shape of light curves is almost independent of the wd mass and of the chemical composition of its hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "this implies that each nova light curve can be uniquely specified by one parameter ( timescaling factor  squeezing / stretching factor against a universal shape of nova light curves ) .",
    "we have reproduced a number of light curves of novae from early phase to supersoft x - ray phase ( turn - on / turnoff times ) @xcite . based on these experiences we are now able to construct empirical formulae that tell us the emergence / decay times of a supersoft x - ray phase of individual novae from observational information of the early phase .",
    "we hope that these formulae are useful for future x - ray observations of classical novae .",
    "the next section ( section [ modeling_of_nova ] ) describes our numerical method for obtaining x - ray , ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and infrared ( ir ) light curves . in section [ properties_of_light_curve ] ,",
    "we show homologous shapes of our model light curves . using characteristic properties of free - free emission model light curves ,",
    "we derive the absolute magnitude of each optical light curve , which provides a unique standard candle of novae . we further propose another method for obtaining the nova absolute brightness by fitting a nova light curve with the other the brightness of which",
    "after various nova timescales and relations between these timescales are presented , we propose our prediction formulae of a supersoft x - ray phase in section [ various_timescales ] .",
    "then , we present our theoretical understanding on the so - called maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline ( mmrd ) relation of classical novae in section [ mmrd_relation ] .",
    "the light - curve analyses of ten classical novae are presented in section [ light_curve_of_ten_novae ] .",
    "the x - ray turn - on / turnoff times of these ten novae , i.e. , v598 pup , v382 vel , v4743 sgr , v1281 sco , v597 pup , v1494 aql , v2467 cyg , v5116 sgr , v574 pup , and v458 vul , are consistent with the above relations ( formulae ) .",
    "conclusions follow in sections [ conclusions ] .",
    "the decay phase of novae can be followed by a sequence of steady state solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using the same method and numerical techniques as in @xcite , we have followed evolutions of novae by connecting steady state solutions along the decreasing envelope mass sequence .",
    "the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope is decreasing due to wind mass - loss and nuclear burning .",
    "we solve a set of equations , consisting of the continuity , equation of motion , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy , from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "winds are accelerated deep inside the photosphere so that they are called `` optically thick winds . ''",
    "we have presented a unified model for ir , optical , uv , and supersoft x - ray light curves of the decay phase of classical novae @xcite .",
    "the optical and ir luminosity are reproduced by free - free emission from optically thin plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this free - free emission flux at the frequency @xmath23 is estimated from equation ( 9 ) of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wind mass - loss rate , @xmath26 the wind velocity at the photosphere , and @xmath27 the photospheric radius , all of which are taken from our wind solutions .",
    "it should be noted that the shapes of free - free emission light curves are independent of the frequency ( wavelength ) .",
    "after the optically thick wind stops , the total mass of the ejecta remains constant in time .",
    "the flux from such homologously expanding ejecta is estimated from equation ( 19 ) of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time after the outburst .    assuming a blackbody spectrum with the photospheric temperature of @xmath17 , we have calculated the uv 1455    light curve for a narrow energy band of 14451465    ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) and have also estimated the supersoft x - ray flux @xcite throughout the present paper for the energy range of 0.20.6 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even if we adopt a different energy range of 0.22.0 kev , shapes of supersoft x - ray light curves hardly change because the blackbody photosphere emits photons with energy of @xmath30 kev for @xmath31 .",
    "the light curves of our optically thick wind model are parameterized by the wd mass ( @xmath32 ) , chemical composition of the wd envelope ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) , and envelope mass ( @xmath38 ) at the time of the outburst ( @xmath15 ) . here",
    "@xmath33 is the hydrogen , @xmath34 the helium , @xmath35 the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen , @xmath36 the neon , and @xmath37 the metallicity content of the envelope .",
    "we adopt @xmath39 , which also includes carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and neon with solar composition ratios .",
    "table [ chemical_composition ] shows nine sets of chemical compositions assumed in our models .",
    "the details of our model light curves and their parameter dependence are described in @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the proportionality of @xmath22 to @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath206 , is a direct result of our scaling law ( the universal decline law ) , because both @xmath193 and @xmath22 are during the optically thick wind phase which is the subject of universal decline law . then the @xmath22 is directly proportional to @xmath193 . on the other hand , the turnoff time of hydrogen shell burning , @xmath195 , is not proportional to @xmath193 or @xmath22 , because the duration of static hydrogen shell burning phase depends on hydrogen content @xmath33 ( amount of fuel ) of the envelope and wd mass ( temperature ) in a different way from the optically thick wind phase , in which the decay rate is determined mainly by wind mass - loss not by hydrogen burning rate ( see figure [ mass_v_uv_x_v1974_cyg_x55z02o10ne03_new_model ] ) .",

    "the emergence / decay times of supersoft x - ray are a good indicator of the wd mass @xcite .",

    "the orbital light curve shows a saw - tooth shape similar to those in other supersoft x - ray novae , e.g. ci aql and v723 cas .",

    "it is @xmath634 days at @xmath376 .",
    "even if we take a smaller mass of @xmath635 , we obtain similar values of @xmath636 , @xmath637 , giving @xmath638 days at @xmath376 .",
    "@xcite explained the early _ swift _ x - ray data as shock - origin , which started about 70 days after the outburst and peaked at about 140 days and then decreased as can be seen in figure [ all_mass_v458_vul_v1974_cyg_x55z02c10o10 ] .",
    "the shock may be formed by collision between two ejecta shells ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by collision between nova winds and the companion star @xcite .",
    "if these x - rays come from the shock between the optically thick wd wind and the companion , the emergence of hard x - rays should be coincident with the emerge of the companion from the wd photosphere .",
    "this is roughly consistent with @xmath638 days . on the other hand ,",
    "the break of free - free emission light curve is caused by a more steeper decrease in the wind mass - loss rate after the break point .",
    "therefore , the drop of x - ray flux at / near 140 days after the outburst is also consistent with our model of @xmath596 days .",
    "the hard x - ray lasted at least until about @xmath639 days , that is , until when the optically thick wind stopped .",
    "it should be noted that , for the orbital period of v458 vul , r. wesson et al .",
    "( private communication ) proposed another orbital period of 98.1 min .",
    "if it is the case , the orbital period of @xmath640 day ( 1.635 hr ) is much shorter than that obtained by @xcite and this period gives @xmath641 from equation ( [ warner_mass_formula ] ) , @xmath642 , @xmath643 , and @xmath644 days ( at @xmath376 ) .",

    ". however , @xmath192 and @xmath3 times are theoretically not unique even if both the wd mass and the chemical composition are given .",
    "these timescales depend further on the initial envelope mass as already explained in section [ properties_of_light_curve ] .",
    "therefore , we must obtain @xmath192 and @xmath3 times from each outburst of various novae . good agreement between our prediction formulae and",
    "the observation on @xmath197 and @xmath198 suggests that our nova models of optically thick winds and free - free model light curves are reasonable for the entire description of nova evolutions and , at the same time , the scatter in the initial nova envelope mass is not so large from their average . in our modeling , we estimated their average relations , @xmath3 vs. @xmath22 or @xmath3 vs. @xmath195 , from the model of v1668 cyg .",
    "such a relatively small scatter of the 10 novae from these relations strongly suggests that we reasonably predict the supersoft x - ray phases of novae from this diagram , i.e. , from equations ( [ t_3-t_wind ] ) and ( [ t_3-t_h_burning ] ) if we can estimate accurate `` intrinsic '' @xmath192 or @xmath3 time from early optical light curves .",

    "the model parameters governing the light curves are the wd mass ( @xmath32 ) , chemical composition of the wd envelope ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) , and the initial envelope mass ( @xmath199 ) . * our free - free emission model light curves reasonably well",

    "we propose a mechanism of early hard x - ray emission originated from the shock between the optically thick winds and the companion star .",
    "our model predicts that the hard x - rays emerge when the companion appears from the white dwarf photosphere and decay when the optically thick winds stop .",
    "our estimates of emerging - time @xmath327 of the companion from the nova photosphere are consistent with the observed hard x - ray appearance in v382 vel , v1494 aql , and v458 vul ; which may support our idea of hard x - ray emission .",
    "we thank aavso , afoev , vsnet , and vsolj for nova photometric data .",
    "we are also grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments that helped to improve the paper .",
    "this work made use of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",

    "in this appendix , we present a formulation of scaling law for free - free emission model light curves and derive equation ( [ simple_final_scaling_flux ] ) . we determine the flux of our free - free light curves against that of @xmath61 wd ( @xmath81 v1668 cyg ) .",
    "now we explicitly express the proportionality constant in equation ( [ wind - free - free - emission ] ) as @xmath666^{\\{m_{\\rm wd}\\}}_{(t)}. \\label{explicit - wind - free - free - emission}\\ ] ] in free - free emission , @xmath667 is independent of frequency @xmath23 , then @xmath668 is also independent of frequency because each term in the square bracket of the right - hand - side is also independent of frequency .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath668 probably depends not only on the wd mass but also weakly on the chemical composition and other physical conditions . however , we here assume that @xmath668 depends only on @xmath32 when we fix the chemical composition .",
    "then , we obtained @xmath75 from equation ( [ time - derivation - flux ] ) after time - stretching ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the free - free flux is independent of the frequency @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath669 , this simply means @xmath670 now , we define the apparent @xmath71 magnitudes as @xmath671 and , for 0.95 @xmath80 wd ( @xmath81 v1668 cyg ) with @xmath672 , we have @xmath673 where we introduce a constant @xmath674 in order to fit @xmath675 of @xmath61 wd model with the @xmath71 observation of v1668 cyg , and @xmath674 is the same among various wd masses .",
    "using equation ( [ scaled - wind - free - free - emission ] ) , we have @xmath676    by the way , we have already defined the apparent @xmath71 magnitudes of our free - free emission model light curves as @xmath677^{\\{m_{\\rm wd}\\}}_{(t / f_{\\rm s } ) } + k_v , \\label{scaling_flux}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ simple_scaling_flux ] ) . here",
    "@xmath83 is a constant defined to fit @xmath79 of @xmath61 wd model with the @xmath71 observation of v1668 cyg , and common among all the wd mass models ( from @xmath55 to 1.2 @xmath80 by 0.05 @xmath80 step ) for a chemical composition of `` co nova 2 . ''",
    "we saw that all the light curves are almost overlapped to each other in figure [ v1668_cyg_vy_jhk_mag_x35z02c10o20_model_scaling_law ] .",
    "this simply means that @xmath678^{\\{m_{\\rm wd}\\}}_{(t",
    "/ f_{\\rm s } ) } \\approx \\left [ { { \\dot m_{\\rm wind}^2 } \\over { v_{\\rm ph}^2 r_{\\rm ph } } }   \\right]^{\\{0.95~m_\\sun\\}}_{(t)}. \\label{overlapping - flux - free - free - emission}\\ ] ] substituting equation ( [ explicit - wind - free - free - emission ] ) into equation ( [ scaled - wind - free - free - emission ] ) and using equation ( [ overlapping - flux - free - free - emission ] ) , we have @xmath679 from equation ( [ overlapping - flux - free - free - emission ] ) together with equations ( [ 095_apparent_flux_def ] ) and ( [ scaling_flux ] ) , we derive @xmath680 therefore , we may regard that @xmath681 , or in other words , @xmath682 if we define @xmath83 as @xmath683 thus , we derive equation ( [ simple_final_scaling_flux ] ) .",
    "therefore , we plotted all the brightnesses of novae in the @xmath73 vs. @xmath684 diagram as shown in figure [ v1668_cyg_vy_jhk_mag_x35z02c10o20_model_scaling_law ] .",
    "it should be noted that the uv 1455   and supersoft x - ray model light curves follow @xmath685 after stretching but do not satisfy @xmath686 , so that these fluxes do not obey equations ( [ scaled - wind - free - free - emission ] ) and ( [ final_scaling_flux ] ) , because the blackbody emissivity depends on the frequency @xmath23 and , as a result , the spectrum changes after time - stretching ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "therefore , we have to normalize the uv fluxes by different factors to fit the peaks with the observational peak of v1668 cyg , as already mentioned in section [ properties_of_light_curve ] .",
    "the photospheric radius of a typical nova during a supersoft x - ray phase is usually much larger than the chandrasekhar radius .",
    "it is about ten times larger ( @xmath687 cm ) than the chandrasekhar radius at the beginning of a supersoft x - ray phase and quickly shrinks with the photospheric temperature being increasing .",
    "therefore , we here present a simple formula on the radius of wd photosphere during a supersoft x - ray phase , which may be used for estimating the x - ray emission area . the photospheric radius of the wd envelope in the supersoft x - ray phase is plotted in figure [ st_mariko ] against the photospheric temperature for various wd masses with the chemical composition of `` co nova 2 '' and `` ne nova 2 . ''",
    "the left edge of each line corresponds to the epoch when the wind stops ( at @xmath688 when the supersoft x - ray emerges ) . as the photosphere shrinks , the photospheric temperature rises .",
    "the rightmost point of each line denotes the epoch when hydrogen nuclear burning stops .",
    "we see that the photospheric radius @xmath27 is almost inversely proportional to a square of the photospheric temperature @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath689 , because the total luminosity is almost constant , @xmath690  const .",
    ", in the supersoft x - ray phase except the very later phase",
    ".    the radius of a typical fast classical nova ( @xmath691 wd with a composition of `` co nova 2 '' ) can be approximated by the black solid line as @xmath692 for @xmath693 ( k ) @xmath694 .",
    "the dashed lines denote the upper and lower bound values of @xmath695 which covers the most of the wd mass representative for classical novae , i.e. , from @xmath696 with `` co nova 2 '' to @xmath697 with `` ne nova 2 . ''",
    "the slow novae are not covered in the region , i.e. , @xmath698 with `` co novae 2 '' has smaller photospheric radius as shown in figure [ st_mariko ] .",
    "this figure also shows the wd radius , i.e. , the bottom of a hydrogen burning zone : the chandrasekhar radius for @xmath699 and values taken from @xcite for @xmath700 .",

    "<S> on the basis of the recently developed universal decline law of classical novae , we propose prediction formulae for supersoft x - ray on and off times , i.e. , @xmath0 days and @xmath1 days for @xmath2 days . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the newly proposed `` intrinsic '' decay time during which the brightness drops by 3 magnitudes from optical maximum along our universal decline law fitted with observation . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the absolute magnitude of our free - free emission model light curves and derived maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline ( mmrd ) relations . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical mmrd relations are governed by two parameters , one is the white dwarf ( wd ) mass and the other is the initial envelope mass at a nova outburst ; this second parameter explains the scatter of mmrd points of individual novae . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical mmrd relations are also in good agreement with the well - known empirical formulae . </S>",
    "<S> we also show another empirical relation of @xmath4 based on the absolute magnitude of our model light curves , i.e. , the absolute magnitude at 15 days after optical maximum is almost common among various novae . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed ten nova light curves , in which a supersoft x - ray phase was detected , and estimated their wd masses . </S>",
    "<S> the models best reproducing simultaneously the optical and supersoft x - ray observations are onemg wds with @xmath5 ( v598 pup ) , @xmath6 ( v382 vel ) , @xmath7 ( v4743 sgr ) , @xmath8 ( v1281 sco ) , @xmath9 ( v597 pup ) , @xmath10 ( v1494 aql ) , @xmath11 ( v2467 cyg ) , @xmath12 ( v5116 sgr ) , @xmath13 ( v574 pup ) , and a co wd with @xmath14 ( v458 vul ) . </S>",
    "<S> the newly proposed relationships are consistent with the emergence or decay epoch of the supersoft x - ray phase of these ten novae . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the mechanism of shock - origin hard x - ray component in relation to the emergence of companion star from the wd envelope . </S>"
