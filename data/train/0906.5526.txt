    "the search for the higgs boson is one of the prominent goals of the future high - energy collider experiments .",
    "the massive fermions and gauge bosons in the standard model ( sm ) acquire their masses through the mediation of a single scalar higgs boson .",
    "the mass of this sm higgs boson receives quadratic divergences at the one - loop level due to the radiative corrections from other sm particle loops .",
    "the simplest way to solve this problem is to introduce the supersymmetry ( susy ) to the sm .",
    "the susy partners to the sm particles help to eliminate the quadratic divergences to the higgs boson mass , by the cancellation between each sm particle loop and its superparticle loop , at the one - loop level .",
    "however , if the susy is a broken symmetry in nature , the cancelation is not complete and thus the higgs boson mass receives non - zero quantum corrections at the one - loop level [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the most economical susy model is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where two higgs doublets are introduced in order to cancel the gauge anomaly .",
    "they give masses independently to down - type fermions and up - type fermions .",
    "since studies of the mssm has revealed a few theoretical problems such as the @xmath1 problem [ 5 ] , various alternative susy models have been introduced .",
    "the @xmath0-extended supersymmetric standard model ( ussm ) is one of the non - minimal supersymmetric models which does not suffer the mssm @xmath1 problem .",
    "the ussm is characterized by the extra @xmath2 gauge symmetry at the tev scale [ 6 - 23 ] .",
    "thus , there is an extra neutral gauge boson with a mass of a tev scale . also , the ussm has a larger higgs sector , which consists of a neutral higgs singlet besides two higgs doublets . in the ussm ,",
    "the quantity corresponding to the @xmath1 parameter of the mssm is dynamically generated by the vacuum expectation value of the higgs singlet .",
    "another characteristic of the ussm is that each sm generation is extended by an extra pair of @xmath3 singlet quarks , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with electric charges @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the presence of these exotic quarks is interesting from the phenomenological point of view . in particular , scenarios with a light exotic quark in the ussm",
    "have extensively been investigated [ 18 - 22 ] . a recent study",
    "have shown that the exotic quarks may contribute by large amount to the cp mixing between the heaviest scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons [ 18 ] . since the exotic quarks couple directly to the neutral higgs singlet , the heaviest higgs boson mass at the one - loop level might be affected by the exotic quark loops . also , the exotic quark loops contribute to the gluon fusion process of the higgs production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "these effects of the exotic quarks have been studied elsewhere [ 22 ] . while some approximations have been made in ref . [ 22 ] , the calculations in this article are carried out in a rigorous way .    in this article , we continue to study the higgs potential in the ussm at the one - loop level .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the higgs productions and decays at the lhc .",
    "we take into account the radiative corrections due to the quarks of the third generation , exotic quarks , and their superpartners at the leading order .",
    "we calculate the production cross sections of the scalar higgs bosons via the gluon fusion process .",
    "it is found that the production of the heaviest scalar higgs boson might be significantly enhanced for a parameter region by the exotic quark and scalar quarks contributions .",
    "we also study the dominant decay modes of the scalar higgs bosons . among them , we calculate the decay processes of the scalar higgs bosons into gluon pairs , which are mediated by the loops of the quarks , exotic quarks , and their superpartners . the gluonic decay mode might be important for the higgs search of the ussm at the lhc , since it may exhibit the role of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks .",
    "in particular , we find that the decay of the heaviest scalar higgs boson into a pair of gluons depends virtually only on the loops of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks .    the article is organized as follows : in the next section , the higgs potential of the ussm is described .",
    "then , we calculate the masses of the pseudoscalar and the three neutral scalar higgs bosons at the one - loop level .",
    "these one - loop masses are taken as input for the higgs production calculations in section 4 and the higgs decay calculations in section 5 .",
    "numerical analysis is presented in section 6 , and conclusions in the last section .",
    "there are two higgs doublet superfields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a higgs singlet superfield @xmath10 in the ussm .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the ussm is @xmath11 . for the higgs superpotential",
    ", we consider only the quarks of the third generation , and one family of the exotic quarks , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the superpotential of the ussm may be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the yukawa couplings of the top , bottom , and exotic quarks , respectively , @xmath18 is the left - handed quark doublet superfield of the third generation , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the charge conjugate superfields of the right - handed top quark and the right - handed bottom quark , @xmath21 is the dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath22 is a @xmath23 antisymmetric matrix defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the higgs sector of the ussm consists of two higgs doublets , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and one higgs singlet @xmath27 .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential , @xmath28 , is obtained by collecting the @xmath29-terms and the @xmath30-terms of the above superpotential , and adding physically allowed soft terms .",

    "we do not consider in this article the cp violation in the ussm , which may take place in the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "thus , the parameters of the higgs potential as well as the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields are taken to be real in following procedure .",
    "the effective @xmath2 hypercharges of the higgs fields satisfy the identity relation of @xmath45 in order to ensure the @xmath2 gauge invariance .",
    "the soft susy breaking masses @xmath38 may be eliminated by using the three minimum conditions for the higgs potential that define the vacuum .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the neutral components of higgs fields will develop vacuum expectation values as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we introduce a free parameter , @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is fixed by electroweak data as 175 gev . in terms of the vacuum expectation values ,",
    "the masses of top , bottom , and exotic quarks are respectively given as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the tree - level @xmath23 mass matrices for the scalar partners to top , bottom , and exotic quarks in the ussm may be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "for simplicity , we rewrite @xmath56 as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively , for the scalar partners to top , bottom , and exotic quarks .",
    "the matrix elements are obtained from the tree - level higgs potential in the on - shell lagrangian after the elimination of the auxiliary fields as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the soft susy breaking masses for the scalar quarks , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the trilinear soft susy breaking parameters for them , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    "at the one - loop level , quarks and their scalar partners contribute to the radiative corrections through loops .",
    "the contributions from the loops of top quark and top scalar quarks are most dominant for a wide region in the parameter space .",
    "also , the radiative corrections due to the loops of bottom quark and bottom scalar quarks might be phenomenologically significant , especially for very large @xmath80 , at the low energy scale .",
    "the contributions from the loops of the exotic quark and its scalar partners in the ussm are not well studied .",
    "we have suggested elsewhere that their contributions are worthwhile studying from a phenomenological point of view because the exotic quark couples directly to the higgs singlet @xmath27 in the ussm [ 22 ] .",
    "thus , in this article , we consider the loops of top , bottom , exotic quark and their scalar partners in our calculations at the one - loop level .",

    "we remark that , in a previous study , we have neglected for the sake of simplicity the @xmath30-term contributions of the the scalar quarks for the neutral higgs boson masses [ 22 ] .",
    "one may obtain the results of ref . [",
    "22 ] by taking @xmath120 in the above expressions .",
    "thus , the above expressions for the scalar higgs boson masses at the one - loop level are more rigorous and complete , and calculated for the first time in the ussm .",
    "it is well noticed that the gluon fusion process , mediated by the top quark triangular loops , is the most dominant production channel for the sm higgs boson in @xmath121 collisions at the energy of the lhc .",
    "the gluon fusion process is also important for the productions of the scalar higgs bosons of the ussm at the lhc , where the loops of top quark and top scalar quarks , by far , would play the most dominant role , for a large space of the relevant parameters of the ussm .",

    "the other branching ratios are very small to be included in the figure .",
    "note that the branching ratios for pairs of ordinary quarks are flat against @xmath68 , whereas br(@xmath258 ) increases very slightly as @xmath68 increases , since the mass of the lighter exotic scalar quark decreases down to about the top quark mass as @xmath68 increases . comparing fig .",
    "4 with the following figures , one can see that br(@xmath255 ) is much larger than br(@xmath259 ) , or br(@xmath260 ) that is too small to be shown in fig .",
    "6 .    in fig . 5",
    ", we show the branching ratios of @xmath261 , namely , br(@xmath259 ) , br(@xmath262 ) , br(@xmath263 ) , and br(@xmath264 ) , as functions of @xmath68 . here",

    "notice that br(@xmath264 ) decreases mildly as @xmath68 increases by the contribution of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks for the full range of @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath164 is much heavier than @xmath254 or @xmath261 , its decay channels are richer than the lighter scalar higgs bosons .",
    "in particular , it may decay into a pair of exotic scalar quarks or into a pair of exotic quarks , depending on the masses of participating particles . according to our analysis ,",
    "the masses are obtained as @xmath266= 780 gev , @xmath141 = 400 gev , and @xmath267 gev .",
    "thus , @xmath164 may decay into a pair of exotic quarks off shell , and into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks both on and off shell .",
    "let us consider the on - shell decays of @xmath164 into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks for @xmath268 gev .",
    "its partial decay width is given by @xmath269 where @xmath270 is given by eq .",
    "this formula is used to calculate the branching ratio of @xmath164 into a pair of @xmath271 . in fig .",
    "6 , we show br(@xmath272 ) , the branching ratio for @xmath164 decays into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks , as function of @xmath68 , as well as other dominant branching ratios of @xmath164 , namely , br(@xmath273 ) , br(@xmath166 ) , br(@xmath167 ) , br(@xmath274 ) , br(@xmath275 ) , br(@xmath276 ) , and br(@xmath277 ) .",
    "it is clear in fig . 6",
    "that @xmath164 would decay mostly into a pair of lighter scalar higgs bosons : br(@xmath273 ) and br(@xmath166 ) are almost equal and dominant over other decay channels .",
    "nevertheless , br(@xmath278 ) increases sharply at @xmath279 gev , and becomes quite compatible to them .",
    "note that br(@xmath278 ) reaches its maximum at @xmath280 gev .",
    "one may also notice that the branching ratio for a gluon pair is far less than 1 % , and fluctuates visibly due to the @xmath68 dependence of the exotic contributions .",
    "it is comparable to br(@xmath275 ) or br(@xmath276 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath164 decays into a gluon pair is almost solely mediated by the loops of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks .    in fig .",
    "6 , one may notice that @xmath164 may decay quite dominantly into a pair of @xmath254 , a pair of @xmath261 , a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks , a pair of top quarks , or into @xmath254 and @xmath261 , as well as a pair of gluons .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath164 into a pair of gluons is very small as 0.001 at best .",
    "we can obtain the number of raw higgs events by using the integrated luminosity of the detectors such as cms [ 32 ] or atlas [ 33 ] .",
    "for the integrated luminosity of 700 fb@xmath281 which is expected to be reached in about ten years at the lhc ( cms + atlas ) , about 140 raw higgs events for @xmath164 would be produced at the lhc [ 34 ] .",
    "thus , the decay mode of @xmath164 into a pair of gluons would not be relevant for any practical purpose , since the background for such events is large at the lhc .",
    "consequently , other decay modes would be more worthwhile studying , or the super lhc ( slhc ) , an upgrade of the lhc , is necessary to study the gluon decays of the heaviest quark in our model .",
    "note that the target of the integrated luminosity for slhc is about 3000 fb@xmath281 during the period of its operation [ 34 ] .",
    "the mass of the sm higgs boson is determined by the vacuum expectation value of the electroweak symmetry breaking , in which itself plays a crucial role .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the sm higgs boson has a mass of the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking . by requiring that there should be no landau pole up to the cut off scale , the renormalization group equation for the mass of the sm higgs boson predicts that it is smaller than 190 gev , if the cut off scale is the planck mass scale .",
    "if the sm higgs boson is discovered with a mass of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and if @xmath164 of the present model is about 780 gev , there would be no serious difficulty to distinguish between them .",
    "on the other hand , if the sm higgs boson is discovered with a mass comparable to the mass of @xmath164 of the present model , their decay modes may be a useful tool to distinguish between them . for the parameter value",
    "we consider , the mass of @xmath164 is about 780 gev , and its decay modes are shown in fig .",
    "6 . let us assume that the mass of the sm higgs boson is also about 780 gev . with this mass , the sm higgs boson would decay 60 % in @xmath185 boson pairs , 30 % in @xmath178 boson pairs , and 7 % in top quark pairs .",
    "on the other hand , as fig .",
    "6 shows , @xmath164 would decay 45 % into @xmath282 and 45 % into @xmath283 for @xmath284 , or 30 % each for @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath285 for @xmath286 gev .",
    "further , as figs .",
    "4 and 5 show , @xmath254 and @xmath261 would respectively decay into a pair of bottom quarks by 60 % and 19 % .",
    "therefore , using the decay modes of bottom quark pairs as background , assuming 700 fb@xmath281 for the integrated luminosity of the lhc , we would have 29862 events of @xmath287 whereas 2362 events for the same decay modes for the sm higgs bosons . in this case , the signal significance is more than @xmath288 , well above the discovery limit .",
    "since @xmath164 is much heavier than @xmath254 or @xmath261 , it may decay into a pair of exotic scalar quarks or into a pair of exotic quarks .",
    "for the parameter values we take up to now , the mass of @xmath164 is 780 gev , the mass of the exotic quarks is 400 gev , and the mass of the lighter exotic scalar quarks is between 180 and 450 gev .",

    ", we need to explore other regions of the parameter space .",
    "we would like to study the parameter region where @xmath289 400 gev and @xmath266 is larger than 800 gev .",
    "we find that a representative set of the parameter values in this region is @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 gev , @xmath214 gev , @xmath215 gev , @xmath293 gev , and @xmath294 gev .",

    "the behavior of @xmath254 in fig .",

    "4 .    by contrast",
    ", the behavior of the branching ratios of @xmath261 in fig.10 is strikingly different from that in fig . 5 , since @xmath301 gev in fig . 10 and @xmath302 gev in fig .",
    "5 . in particular , the branching ratio for a pair of lighter exotic scalar quarks , br ( @xmath303 ) , can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , whereas it is absent in fig .",
    "5 , as it is forbidden kinematically there .",
    "the coupling coefficient of @xmath261 to a pair of @xmath304 depends very severely on @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the branching ratio for a pair of lighter exotic scalar quarks varies wildly as @xmath68 changes .",

    "the heaviest scalar higgs boson , @xmath164 , on the other hand , may decay into a pair of exotic quarks on shell , as shown in fig .",
    "one may notice that the branching ratio of @xmath306 is considerably larger than the branching ratios for gauge boson pair or gluon pair .",
    "therefore , for some parameter regions where @xmath164 is allowed kinematically to decay into a pair of exotic quarks , the decays of the heaviest scalar quark into exotic quarks may become important to examine our model . also , the branching ratio for a pair of exotic scalar quarks in fig .",

    "we find that the exotic scalar quarks become nearly degenerate in mass for small @xmath68 .    for the ussm higgs phenomenology at the lhc , we study the production processes and decay modes of the scalar higgs bosons that involve gluons . as the scalar higgs bosons may be produced in @xmath121 collisions via the gluon fusion process",
    ", we calculate the production cross sections for the gluon fusion process , considering the loop contributions from top , bottom , and exotic quarks and their superpartners .",
    "we find that , for the heaviest scalar higgs boson of the ussm , the gluon fusion process is mediated virtually only by the loops of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks .",
    "so is the partial decay width of the heaviest scalar higgs boson into a pair of gluons . in other words , practically , the heaviest scalar higgs boson couples to a pair of gluons only through the loops of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks .",
    "thus , the contributions from the loops of top and bottom quarks and their scalar partners are negligible in the gluon fusion process of the heaviest scalar higgs boson production as well as in its partial decay width into a gluon pair . however , the partial decay width of the heaviest scalar higgs boson into a pair of gluons is less than 1 % , just comparable to its partial decay width into a pair of gauge bosons .",
    "we should note that our results are obtained for a particular set of parameter values , allowing @xmath68 to vary between 0 and 450 gev .",
    "thus , it may be hard to say that this set of parameter values represent the whole parameter space of the ussm .",
    "we may have to search a much wider region of the parameter space of the ussm in order to obtain more predictive results for the contributions of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks in the higgs phenomenology .",
    "however , qualitatively , our results suggest that the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks play observable roles in the productions and decays of the scalar higgs bosons of the ussm at the lhc . in order to examine the ussm at the lhc , in particular to examine the effects of the exotic quark sector in the higgs physics",
    ", the heaviest scalar higgs boson may be one of the best windows , as our calculations clearly suggests .",
