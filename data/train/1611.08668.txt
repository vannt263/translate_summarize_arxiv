    "the progress of optical frequency standards has recently been further accelerated to realize the accuracy at the @xmath2 level @xcite .",
    "this accuracy is nearly two orders of magnitude superior to the state - of - the - art microwave standards that realize the si second .",
    "thus , the community of time and frequency metrology has initiated discussion toward the redefinition of the second @xcite .",
    "as the discussion has proceeded , however , it has been recognized that the requirement for the redefinition will not be fulfilled soon , possibly delaying the redefinition by nearly a decade ; until then , we need to maintain traceability to the current si second .",
    "while the most straightforward method of accessing the si second is to develop a cesium ( cs ) fountain , the difficulty of building state - of - the - art standards limits the availability .    the frequency link to international atomic time ( tai )",
    "is known to be an alternative means of accessing the si second @xcite . in particular ,",
    "temporally distributed operations of an optical clock over a five - day tai grid have reduced the possibility that the measurement is misled by the temporal frequency fluctuation of a local flywheel oscillator @xcite . while the up time ratio was only 11% over the five - day campaign , the dead time uncertainty between the optical clock and the local flywheel oscillator was reduced to @xmath3 . thanks to these efforts , the total uncertainty of the absolute frequency has resulted in @xmath4 @xcite , which is already less than the systematic uncertainty of some cs fountain standards that are recognized by the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm ) as the primary frequency standards ( pfs ) .",
    "tai is computed by bipm from the clock data provided by more than 400 commercial atomic clocks globally distributed in national metrological laboratories or astronomical institutes @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this virtual mean time scale ( echelle atomique libre , eal ) is its superb stability and robustness .",
    "however , as eal has been continuously free - running since 1977 , its scale interval has an offset from the si second of several parts in @xmath5 .",
    "bipm estimates the frequency of eal with respect to all evaluations of pfss and secondary frequency standards ( sfss ) that are available at the time of tai computation .",
    "the algorithm for deriving this estimation and its uncertainty are described in @xcite , and the result is published every month in circular t as the `` duration of the tai scale interval '' over the one - month interval of tai computation .",
    "in contrast to the robustness of tai , the operation of optical clocks seldom continues for one month , requiring tai with a short averaging interval as the reference of frequency measurements .",
    "the shortest interval of the tai scale is five days as tai is computed by the bipm only for 0:00 utc every fifth day .",
    "thus , optical frequency measurements normally utilize the tai scale of five days as a reference .",
    "the calibration of the tai relative to the si second , on the other hand , is normally available for only one - month mean in circular t. therefore , we need to estimate possible error in assimilating the tai frequency over five days to the one - month mean published in circular t. this effect was called `` dead time ( tai ) '' in the error budget , and was the most dominant source of uncertainty in the previous work @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we describe how to reduce this dominant uncertainty by employing the calibration of the tai scale on each five - day interval of operation of our optical clock using the same algorithm as that described in @xcite.with respect to our previous work @xcite , the re - evaluation of the link part has led to a @xmath6correction of the @xmath0 clock frequency and the total uncertainty of the @xmath0 clock frequency was reduced to less than @xmath7 for the first time without local pfss .",
    "the revised frequency is consistent with other measurements employing local cs fountains .",
    "l|rr|rr|rr campaign # & & & + mjd & & & + & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 + tai - si second & & & & & & + ( 30 days , @xmath10)@xmath11 & -4.4 & 2.6 & -2.7 & 2.5 & -2.3 & 2.6 + tai - si second & & & & & & + ( 5 days , @xmath10 ) & -2.5 & 8.1 & -6.8 & 8.2 & -4.5 & 7.4 + tai - si second only by pfs & & & & & & + active over the interval ( 5 days , @xmath10 ) & -4.8 & 8.2 & -7.8 & 8.3 & -4.8 & 7.4 +    the least - squares method of deriving the consistent frequency error and the uncertainty of the tai scale is described in @xcite . here",
    ", the estimation interval is a free parameter , although bipm regularly calculates only for an estimation interval of one month . by setting the estimation interval to be 5 days",
    ", we no longer suffer from the discrepancy of the tai interval between the interval of our optical frequency measurement and the interval for the calibration of the tai with reference to the si second .",
    "thus , it is not required to introduce the uncertainty in regarding the two mean frequencies as being identical .",
    "the new calibrations of tai obtained with the estimation interval of five days are summarized in table 1 .",
    "there were three campaigns ( # 13 ) for five ( or four ) days each .",
    "the maximum difference in the correction from the one - month average is @xmath12 at maximum , which is consistent with the instability of tai @xcite .",
    "when we use the five - day average , the link from tai to a flywheel oscillator and that to the si second have the same averaging interval .",
    "thus , there is no additional dead - time error here .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the tai scale calibration increases from about @xmath13 over one month to about @xmath14 over five days , mostly as a result of the increased dead - time between the pfs evaluation intervals and the five - day estimation interval .",
    "nevertheless , this dead - time uncertainty is more correctly estimated using the algorithm in @xcite , and thus the final uncertainty is better when using five - day intervals .    in order to evaluate the weighted average of the three campaigns , we need to investigate the correlation among these three tai - si second calibrations .",
    "for instance , the systematic error of cs fountains is totally correlated when identical fountains are operated in three campaigns .",
    "table 2 shows the pfss that were operated in the three campaigns .",
    "the uncertainties in the calibration include the type - a and type - b uncertainties of the pfs , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , as well as the link uncertainty @xmath17 .",
    "the type - a uncertainty is a statistical uncertainty determined by the measurement duration and the magnitude of the white frequency noise in the pfs system .",
    "the type - b uncertainty is the uncertainty of the systematic bias .",
    "in addition , the calibration by a sfs has an uncertainty of the secondary representation of the second @xmath18 .",
    "these uncertainties are shown in circular t together with the total uncertainty @xmath19 .",
    "it is reasonable to regard @xmath20 as proportional to the weight that determines the tai - si second calibration @xcite .",
    "the weight also allows us to estimate how much of @xmath19 is attributed to the systematic part , namely @xmath16 .",
    "given the systematic uncertainty of the pfs @xmath21 to be @xmath22 , the weighted mean of the systematic part @xmath23 in the campaign @xmath24 is written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the weight of the calibration by pfs @xmath21 in the campaign @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath27 for each campaign resulted in @xmath28 , indicating rather minor contribution comparing with typical @xmath19 of several parts per @xmath29 .",
    "the weights derived from @xmath20 suggest that the calibrations in the three campaigns rely on syrte - fo2 with the largest weight of 44% .",
    "while systematic uncertainties among pfss should have no correlations , this rather high occupancy of a single fountain prevents us from employing the reduced systematic uncertainty by the statistical mean , therefore we consider a systematic part of @xmath30 also for the mean of the three determinations . the rest of uncertainties of the campaign @xmath31 , @xmath32 is calculated to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the type - a and link uncertainties of the pfs @xmath21 in campaign @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these random parts are averaged to obtain the total random error of the three campaigns , which resulted in a value of @xmath36 . considering the systematic part of @xmath30",
    ", we concluded that the total uncertainty of the averaged tai scale against the si second is @xmath37 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the uncertainty budget with the revised link uncertainty is shown in table 3 along with the previous one @xcite .",
    "changes can be seen in the bottom two rows , namely , dead time ( tai ) and tai - si second . the dead - time uncertainty in assimilating the tai frequency over five days to that computed by the bipm over 30 days was removed with a penalty of a larger tai - si second uncertainty for each five - day evaluation .",
    "nevertheless , the trade - off is beneficial , and the overall uncertainty was @xmath38 , which is below @xmath7 for the first time for a measurement using the tai .     and the uncertainty was reduced to less than @xmath7 . ]    finally , the revised absolute frequencies measured in the three campaigns are summarized in fig .",
    "1 together with the previous ones . for a given 5-days interval ,",
    "the maximum difference between the two frequency links is 0.18 hz @xmath39 ( see table 1 ) . the calculation of the weighted average of the three campaigns resulted in a final value of 429 228 004 229 872.97 ( 40 ) hz using the novel frequency link .",
    "we consider that the frequency of the measurement in 2015 @xcite should be modified to this new value because the frequency reevaluated here has a lower uncertainty .",
    "this revised frequency agrees with other measurements recently performed in various laboratories .",
    "the frequencies are compared in fig .",
    "2 , where the first six points were additionally taken into consideration for the determination of the recommended standard frequency of the cipm 2015 ( comit international des poids et mesures 2015 ) .",
    "the red circle @xcite was reevaluated in this work as the blue circle .",
    "the last four points were reported after the cctf2015 ( consultative committee for time and frequency 2015 ) .",
    "in particular , the degree of agreement is excellent with the results recently reported from syrte @xcite and ptb @xcite using locally available state - of - the - art fountains .",
    "clock transition frequencies recently reported from various institutes including syrte @xcite , ptb @xcite , nict @xcite , nmij @xcite , and nim @xcite . the previous result ( red empty circle )",
    "was reevaluated to the blue empty circle in this work . ]",
    "in summary , we reduced the uncertainty of the previous absolute frequency measurement @xcite by employing a tai estimation interval of five days , which matched the length of the measurement campaign .",
    "temporally distributed operation of optical clocks over the five - day tai grid led to the suppression of the link uncertainty between local flywheel oscillator and tai in previous work .",
    "the uncertainty of the frequency link from tai to the si second over the 5-day measurement intervals was also reduced in this work , resulting in a total uncertainty below @xmath7 for the first time for a tai - based measurement .",
    "note that further improvement would result from a longer operation interval as this would improve the uncertainty in both the frequency of tai and the frequency transfer from utc(nict ) to tai .",
    "another potential advantage of the tai - based measurement is that the limitation due to the possible systematic bias of a specific pfs is mitigated by the contribution of other pfss .",
    "for instance , estimating the frequency simultaneously with reference to four similarly accurate pfss via tai statistically reduces the pfs - originated systematic uncertainty by a factor of two .",
    "regular calibration of the tai scale using optical clocks will not only contribute to the maintenance of the time scale , but also contribute to the determination of accurate standard frequencies .",
    "the authors are grateful for the discussion with y. hanado , f. nakagawa , h. ito , t. gotoh , m. kumagai , and m. hosokawa .",
    "it is also worth noting that the measurement depends on cs fountains at national metrological institutes provided for the calibration of the tai scale .",
