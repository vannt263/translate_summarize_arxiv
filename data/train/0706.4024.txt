    "white dwarfs have long been used to probe the low mass end of the imf to look for low mass stellar and brown dwarf companions @xcite . with the advent of more sensitive ground- and space - based imaging at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the direct detection of substellar objects and planets with a few times jupiter s mass around white dwarfs is now possible @xcite .    searching a subset of white dwarfs that harbor markers for substellar objects can maximize the return of such a survey .",
    "nearby hydrogen white dwarfs with metal line absorption ( dazs ) may fit this criterion .",
    "three hypotheses have been put forth to explain the presence of dazs : interstellar matter ( ism ) accretion @xcite , unseen companion wind accretion @xcite , and accretion of volatile poor planetesimals @xcite .",
    "ism accretion has a wealth of problems in predicting many aspects of dazs such as the large accretion rates required for some objects and the distribution of these objects with respect to known clouds of dense material @xcite .",
    "the quick atmospheric settling times of hydrogen atmospheres imply that the white dwarfs are in close proximity with accretionary material .",
    "there are roughly 40 cool dazs known @xcite . of them",
    ", seven have dm companions , supporting the argument that dazs could have unseen companions that place material onto the wd surface through winds @xcite . in order to accrete enough material",
    ", companions must be in extremely close orbits ( p@xmath31 day ) , bringing into question why these objects have yet to be discovered through radial velocity surveys of compact objects or observable excesses in near - ir flux . in most cases the reflex motion from such objects would be easily detectable , on the order of a few to tens of km / s @xcite .",
    "the idea of the presence of unseen companions also can not explain objects like g 29 - 38 and 4 other white dwarfs which have infrared excesses due to dust disks within their host white dwarf s tidal disruption radius @xcite .",
    "the disks around g 29 - 38 and gd 362 show an amorphous silicate emission feature at @xmath010 implying a small grain size within the disk and possibly warped geometries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , companions @xmath1 13 m@xmath2 are ruled out for a wide range of orbital separations around g 29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "the invocation of cometary or asteroidal material as a method of polluting wd atmospheres was developed to explain photospheric absorption lines due to metals in the daz wd 0208 + 395 ( g  74 - 7 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the rates predicted by these original studies could not satisfactorily explain the highest accretion rates inferred for some objects and could not easily reproduce the distribution of dazs based on their effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , mixing length theory predicts a drop - off of observability for accretion as a function of effective temperature which may swamp out the earlier prediction of @xcite @xcite . also unclear is the effect non - axisymmetric mass loss could have on the fraction of comet clouds lost by their hosts during post main sequence evolution @xcite . by hypothesis ,",
    "cometary clouds are the result of planet formation , so the long term evolution of planetary systems and their interaction with these comet clouds needs to be investigated @xcite .",
    "the loss of a star s outer envelope during post main sequence evolution specifically affects the stability of planetary systems , and can rescue the scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "the hill stability criterion against close approaches for two comparable mass planets qualitatively describes what happens to a planetary system .",
    "the stability criterion in this case is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the semi - major axis , @xmath6 is the mass ratio of the planets to the host star , and @xmath7 represents the critical separation at which the two planets become unstable to close approaches @xcite . during adiabatic mass loss ,",
    "companions expand their orbits in a homologous way , increasing their orbital semi - major axes by a factor m@xmath8/m@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the critical separation grows as the relative separation of the two planets stays the same , resulting in marginally stable systems being tipped over the edge of stability .",
    "this instability can lead to orbital rearrangements , the ejection of one planet , and collisions @xcite .",
    "these three events dramatically change the dynamical state of the planetary system .",
    "a fraction of unstable systems will perturb a surviving oort cloud or kuiper belt analogue and send a shower of comets into the inner system where they tidally disrupt , cause dust disks , and slowly settle onto the wd surface .",
    "this modification of the comet impact model can explain the accretion rates needed for the highest abundances of ca observed and the presence of infrared excesses around wds @xcite .    the model of @xcite can be extended to asteroidal material closer to the star . as the central star s mass changes , the basic resonances associated with any planets will change and bring fresh material into unstable orbits .",
    "the amount of pollution will depend on the different timescales for comets and asteroids to be perturbed toward the white dwarf as well as the ratio of objects in either asteroidal or cometary orbits .",
    "asteroids should be perturbed relatively quickly , on timescales of 10@xmath10 yr , while comets can take up to an order of magnitude longer to be perturbed . without a more detailed model , however , it is hard to say which population is responsible for daz pollution .",
    "nine dazs have already been searched for substellar companions at intermediate orbital separations ( 10  au @xmath11 a @xmath11 50 - 100  au ) with nicmos high contrast imaging and ao imaging @xcite .",
    "no planets @xmath110 m@xmath12 were detected for four , and no brown dwarfs @xmath129 m@xmath12 were detected for the other five .",
    "additionally , no unresolved companions were detected down to substellar limits , following a general finding for a dearth of substellar objects around white dwarfs @xcite .    with the launch of _ spitzer _",

    "[ sec : irac ] we detail our _ spitzer _ irac photometry and results , while in  [ sec : nicmos ] we present second epoch nicmos images of wd 1620 - 391 to look for common proper motion companions to the white dwarf .",
    "finally in  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "table [ tab : targs ] shows our target dazs , complete with known t@xmath13 , log g , distances , and ages .",
    "cooling ages were taken from the literature and initial masses and main sequence lifetimes were calculated by the equations of @xcite :    @xmath14    each target was observed with the four irac channels , with nominal wavelengths of @xmath03.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in the mapping mode , with 30 random point dithers for each pair of channels . at each dither point , the camera integrated for 100  s , for a total of 3000  s in each band .",
    "the exception to this was wd 1620 - 391 , which is a much brighter source .",
    "the images had exposure times of 30  s per dither with 75 dithers for a total integration of 2250  s. table [ tab : obs ] summarizes our observations .    in order to obtain _ spitzer _ irac photometry with an accuracy of @xmath03% , we followed the prescription laid out in @xcite .",
    "we took the bcd files from the latest _",
    "pipeline calibrations for each target ( s14.0 ) and created a final , mosaicked image using the mopex package @xcite . some caution for point source photometry with irac is warranted .",
    "post - bcd pipeline calibrated mosaics are not of a high enough fidelity for accurate photometry of stellar point sources .",
    "we routinely found that pbcd images returned photometry systematically 2 - 4% higher than when we used mopex .",
    "we performed overlap correction with a default overlap correction namelist , and mosaicking with the default namelist given in the irac data handbook .",
    "for brighter point sources , the outlier rejection schemes of mopex can spuriously reject good pixels as cosmic rays due to photon noise larger than the background variation .",
    "a typical symptom of this is a coverage map file that shows that many images were thrown out at the position of the target source .",
    "we experienced good results by choosing an upper _ and lower_threshold parameter of 15 for the mosaicin module , as well as using the keyword refine_outlier to ensure bright sources were treated with a threshold closer to 20 .",
    "the thresholds refer to the number of sigma above the mean background . as a final check we visually inspected the resulting coverage maps to ensure that most images were used by the mosaicking program .",
    "since each of our images had several dither positions , we did not make any array - location or pixel phase corrections .",
    "we estimate that these effects are at the level of 1% and not a significant error source , but we include them in our total error .",
    "we performed aperture photometry with a 3 pixel radius ( @xmath03.6 ) , and used a 4-pixel wide annulus starting just outside the source aperture for background subtraction , to ensure as accurate estimate of the background as possible .",
    "aperture corrections appropriate for this size source radius and background annulus were applied , as well as calibration factors , flux conversions and a color correction in each band assuming a @xmath15 spectral slope as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the consistency of both aperture corrections and the photometry with different sized apertures was checked by recalculating the photometry with 5 pixel radius apertures with background annuli with 5-pixel radii starting just outside the source aperture , and 3-pixel source apertures with 10-pixel wide annuli starting at a radius of 10 pixels .",
    "we avoided a 2-pixel source aperture as that appeared to consistently give photometry lower by @xmath02 - 5% . for channels 1 and 2 ,",
    "differences between the three choices were never more than 1% except in the case of wd 0245 + 541 , which has several nearby sources within 4 - 10 pixels .",
    "channels 3 and 4 often had larger changes for the 5 pixel radius aperture , up to @xmath010% but typically closer to 2% .",
    "we attribute these systematic changes primarily to residual structure in the background and to coincident sources .",
    "both of these sources of systematic error are lessened by the small aperture and small background annulus .",
    "we estimate that on average there is a 1% error from sytematic uncertainties in aperture photometry based on our specific choice of aperture and background annulus .",
    "no obvious interstellar cirrus was noted for any of our targets in the 8  channel .",
    "figures [ fig : wd02]- [ fig : wd16 ] show psf subtracted nicmos images of the dazs from @xcite , with contours from the final irac channel 2 images overlaid .",
    "the contour lines correspond to 0.1% , 1% , and 10% of the total measured flux respectively to demonstrate the absence of contaminating objects in the source and background photometric apertures .",
    "the target wd in each image is located at the point ( 0,0 ) , and appears as a speckled area since it is behind the coronagraph and the residual psf has been subtracted off .    for the observations of wd 0208 + 396 ,",
    "the irac detector was struck by a large number of solar protons , degrading the images with cosmic ray hits .",
    "the looser constraints on outlier rejection can give higher counts at the level of 10% .",
    "these hits were worse for the 5.8  channel but we used a more stringent threshold for the mopex outlier routines of 3 for channels 3 and 4 instead of 15 .",
    "inspection of the coverage maps for the channels show that most of the images could still be used , with the most images being rejected for the 5.8  channel .",
    "we verified that we got consistent photometry by visually inspecting individual bcd images and combining only the files without obvious cosmic ray strikes .",
    "the estimated photometric errors for each channel are quite small due to the large s / n achieved .",
    "in addition to the standard errors in photometry , we added a 3.3@xmath16 factor to account for the overall uncertainty in the flux calibrations quoted by @xcite as well as the contributions from uncertainties mentioned above .      in order to detect a bona fide excess",
    ", one must compare the observed flux with an expected flux .",
    "we compared our observations with models of @xcite as well as the @xmath17 photometry of @xcite for four of the five targets .",
    "wd 1620 - 391 was not part of @xcite s survey and so we used a combination of usnob , hipparcos , and 2mass photometry .",
    "fluxes in the mid - infrared were kindly provided ( p.e .",
    "tremblay , private communication ) , using updated models from @xcite and without any knowledge of the measured mid - ir fluxes .",
    "we further normalized these flux densities to a median of the visible and near - ir flux densities to account for any slight offsets between the observed data and the models .",
    "this approach differs from previous work reported , where blackbody extrapolations of the wds k flux density were compared with our _ spitzer _ data @xcite .    for the level of photometric",
    "accuracy we have achieved , white dwarfs with effective temperature of @xmath05000 - 7000  k depart from true black bodies , mainly due to h@xmath18 bound - free and free - free opacity , with the free - free opacity being most important for the near- and mid - infrared ( p.e .",
    "tremblay , private communication ) .",
    "free - free absorption can be calculated precisely at long wavelengths and is incorporated in wd models    figure [ fig:74graph ] shows a representative comparison between the model fluxes and the measured fluxes for wd  0208 + 396 , as well as the residuals .",
    "the full list of predicted and observed irac fluxes for all of our targets is in table [ tab : fluxes ] , while figures [ fig : panel1 ] and [ fig : panel2 ] show the seds of the remaining targets .",
    "we required that a significant excess ( deficit ) be @xmath1 three times the photometric error above ( below ) the calculated model flux in at least one channel .",
    "we find that for the exception of wd 1257 + 278 , the model fluxes and photometry agree to within 1 - 2 @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig : panel2 ] shows the sed of wd 1257 + 278 compared to the model .",
    "there isexactly a 3@xmath19 deficit in the 4.5 band , to a depth of 10% .",
    "the mosaic coverage maps show no images being thrown out where the photometric aperture is located .",
    "a slight mismatch between the model effective temperature and the true effective temperatrue could present an artificial deficit or excess , but the errors in the derived effective temperature are on the order of @xmath02% , which would correspond to errors in the predicted fluxes of 3 - 4% , much less than the observed deficit ( p.e .",
    "tremblay , private communication ) .",
    "despite matching our criteria for selection as a significant deficit , we believe it is tentative at best , based on a detailed analysis of the match between our photometry and the models .    because of the deficit with wd 1257 + 278 we wished to get an empirical sense of",
    "how well the data matched the predicted model fluxes . to that end",
    ", we took the standard deviation of @xmath20 in all the channels where @xmath21 is the difference between the observed flux density and the predicted flux density ( @xmath22 ) , as well as the mean @xmath20 for each channel .",
    "we find that the standard deviation of the sample is @xmath03.7% , while the mean for each channel is -1%,-5%,0.09% , and -3% .",
    "these results indicate that the predicted fluxes match the observed fluxes to within the absolute calibration errors we assume .",
    "we note that the 4.5  channel appears to have a barely marginal ( @xmath01.4@xmath19 ) mean deficit , with four of the five targets possessing @xmath0 5% or greater deficits , wd 1257 + 278 being one of these objects .",
    "wd 0208 - 396 is the only object with no deficit at 4.5 .    as another test , we divided the irac photometry of our target dazs by wd 1620 - 391 , the brightest wd in our sample with the highest signal - to - noise . in this case , we are limited by photon noise and the stability of the irac detectors , which is on the level of @xmath02% .",
    "we compared the relative photometry of wd 1620 - 391 and wd 1257 + 278 to the model fluxes in figure [ fig : comparison ] . within the estimated errors ,",
    "the observed flux ratios match the expected ratios .",
    "we repeated this test with the other white dwarfs and found similar agreement .",
    "the consistency of the flux ratios suggests that the depression of flux at 4.5 micron may be due to a systematic error in the aperture correction , color correction , or calibration factors for that channel .",
    "observed deficits for a white dwarf may be evidence for circumstellar material raining down on its surface . if such a situation were confirmed at 4.5 or 8 , we predict that non - lte absorption by sio gas may be present , with possibly some contribution from co. absorption due to fundamental and overtone rotational - vibrational bands of sio and co in late type stars is well known @xcite .",
    "the dissociation temperature of sio and co are high enough that these species could persist at the temperatures of cooler white dwarfs .",
    "the absorption could be boosted if sio is formed above the white dwarf photosphere through photodissociation of sio@xmath23 ( and any co present is similarly formed through photodissociation of carbonates ) from refractory dust which sublimates as it is brought down to the the white dwarf surface through photon drag .",
    "the resulting sio is formed at low densities just above the photosphere , and is far from local thermodynamic equilibrium , with much larger absorption strengths than inferred from photospheric lte .",
    "this absorption would show up most strongly around 4 - 5  and @xmath08 - 10 where sio has fundamental and first overtone bands at 8.0 and 4.1 , respectively .",
    "co would show up primarily in the second channel with its fundamental band at 4.7@xcite .",
    "the details of this scenario need to be studied further to determine the feasibility of observing absorption due to sio or co gas .      for irac , very cool substellar objects can be detected as excesses , especially due to a `` bump '' of flux for brown dwarfs and planets at @xmath04.5 .",
    "while theoretical models predict the 4.5  flux to be large , observations of cool brown dwarfs suggest that the spectral models overestimate this flux by a factor of @xmath02 @xcite .    in order to place upper limits on the types of unresolved companions present around our targets ,",
    "we compared predicted irac fluxes for cool brown dwarfs and planets by convolving the irac filters with the models of @xcite appropriate for the particular age of each target daz and its distance .",
    "for the 4.5  channel we assumed that the resultant flux was a factor of two smaller than predicted .",
    "we then compared our 4.5   3@xmath19 limits to those models in order to determine a mass limit .",
    "these results are presented in table [ tab : limits ] . in all cases",
    "we improve the unresolved companion limits to these objects over @xcite by a factor of 2 - 4 . for wd 0243 - 026 and wd 1620 - 391 we rule all companions @xmath114 m@xmath12 objects for separations @xmath1176 and 46  au respectively .",
    "we can determine limits to two types of dusty disks , either geometrically flat , optically thick disks , such as that modeled for g  29 - 38 or gd  362 , or diffuse , optically thin disks .",
    "both gd  362 and g  29 - 38 can be well modeled by disks not unlike saturn s rings , within the tidal radius of the white dwarf with an interior edge at the dust sublimation radius @xcite .",
    "if we assume an optically thick disk , the emission of the grains can be modeled following @xcite : @xmath24    with t as a function of r :    @xmath25    this assumes that the inner radius corresponds to a dust sublimation radius of 1200  k. in table [ tab : limits ] , we show the upper limits to @xmath26 based on our lack of 3@xmath19 detections in our 8.0  channel data . in most cases ,",
    "excess emission would have been significantly detected at shorter wavelengths as well .",
    "if this type of disk is present around these dazs , the inner edge of the disks must be at @xmath27 r@xmath28 , or all of them are close to edge - on .",
    "we can quantify the probability of observing 5 systems with inclinations determined by our upper limits out of a random sample of disk inclinations .",
    "for any one disk , this is @xmath01-@xmath29 , and for all five targets the probability is negligible .",
    "most optically thick dust disks observed seem to have exterior radii of @xmath110.6 r@xmath30 @xcite .    given the @xmath31-@xmath32 year settling timescales ( @xmath33 ,",
    "see table [ tab : targs ] ) for our targets , the lack of a disk does not necessarily imply that the dazs can not accrete material in this manner .",
    "as @xcite has pointed out , the timescale for removal of dust grains within the tidal disruption radius of a white dwarf due to poynting - robertson drag is short :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the average grain size and density respectively , and @xmath37 is the distance from the star , ranging from @xmath38 cm .",
    "if an incoming comet or asteroid is disrupted and all of the material is removed before another arrives , then some fraction of the time a daz will have this type of disk and at other times it wo nt while still retaining a detectable metal line signature",
    ". the metal line will remain detectable as long as the metal settling time is roughly longer than the time to the next replenishing collision .",
    "cooler dust from collisions may still be detectable at longer wavelengths , or slowly drift inwards from further away .",
    "using equation [ eq : tpr ] , one can determine the rough orbital separation from which dust would spiral in over 1 gyr , or a typical cooling time for a white dwarf .",
    "assuming the typical values in equation [ eq : tpr ] , dust could spiral in from as far as @xmath020  au .",
    "if we expect an optically thin disk , we see the emission from every emitter .",
    "if one assumes a particular size ( and therefore a particular mass ) per emitter and the number of emitters per unit area , one can determine the total mass in an optically thin dust disk based on the observed flux .",
    "we focus in particular on the limit to dust between the tidal radius of the white dwarf and the dust sublimation radius , since this region is of most interest for explaining daz metal accretion .    for the sake of simplicity , we assume that a constant number density of 1  dust particles reside in a flat optically thin disk between the dust sublimation radius @xmath39 and the approximate tidal disruption radius , @xmath40 of the daz , assuming a @xmath41=3 g  @xmath42 for the parent bodies to the dust . in this case the flux is given by a modification of equation [ eqn : fnu ] : @xmath43 where we have utilized the models of @xcite to calculate the spherical 1   grain temperature of each dust particle given each dazs luminosity @xcite . for each",
    "wd we normalize @xmath44 such that the resultant dust disk spectrum returns the 3@xmath19 flux limit when convolved with the irac 8  channel filter response .",
    "table [ tab : limits ] shows the resulting upper limits for dust disk mass . for wd  1620 - 391 , its radius at which dust sublimates exceeds the tidal disruption radius , and so we expect no dust to be present in this region .",
    "similarly hot white dwarfs would not have dusty disks around them like g  29 - 38 or gd  362 .",
    "they may have gaseous disks around them , as evidenced by the discovery of a gaseous , metal - rich disk around a hot da white dwarf @xcite .",
    "if there are dust disks , then dust accretion could conceivably occur for longer then the daz atmospheric settling times in our sample . however , the pr drag timescale at the tidal disruption radius for each daz is @xmath3 @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that accretion is not driven by pr drag of a present disk .",
    "nicmos coronagraphic images of these five white dwarfs were presented in @xcite , with accompanying limits to companions at 1.1 , as well as 1.6for wd 1620 - 391 .",
    "high spatial resolution nir images are particularly useful for discriminating against potential sources of background contamination which could bias the mid - ir photometry to spurious excesses , given the irac camera s spatial resolution of 1.2/pixel . while it may be rare to find coincident sources that may contaminate the photometry of the target , two of the five targets have visual companions within 4  of the target star .",
    "wd 1620 - 391 , one of the targets with a large number of visual companions , is close to the galactic plane .",
    "this interesting object is not technically a daz .",
    "it a da with no optical metal absorption lines that is a large separation common proper motion companion to a planet bearing star @xcite . in the uv it possesses metallic circumstellar absorption lines @xcite .",
    "the planet bearing star is separated by 575 ( 4451  au ) , and is well off the field - of - view for nicmos . even expecting a large number of coincident sources due to its galactic latitude",
    ", it possessed an overdensity over that expected @xcite .",
    "motivated by this overdensity , a second epoch image of wd 1620 - 391 was obtained in march 2006 , two years after the first image was taken to search for any common proper motion companions .",
    "the new image was reduced following the basic prescription laid out in @xcite , where the white dwarf was imaged at two separate spacecraft roll orientations and each roll image was subtracted from the other and combined to produce a high contrast final image .",
    "the other objects in the field were masked out in the image that was used as a psf reference , since the field of view was moderately crowded and subtraction residuals would hamper the detection of faint sources .",
    "we aligned both epochs on the pixel position of wd  1620 - 391 and rotated the images so that north was in the positive vertical direction of the images , using pixel centers and orientations as header keywords from the stsci pipeline .",
    "we then shifted the second epoch image by the measured proper motion of wd 1620 - 391 of 97.49@xmath463.28 mas / yr ( @xmath47=75.52 mas / yr ) in right ascension and 0.05@xmath461.74 mas / yr in declination @xcite to align the shifted background stars .",
    "we measured the centroids of @xmath070 observed objects common in both fields using the idl astrolib routine gcntrd and measured the difference in centroid position from one epoch to another . with this procedure",
    ", any object co - moving with wd 1620 - 391 would have a position shift of 2.58 nicmos pixels , or 019 .",
    "figure [ fig : wd1620prop ] shows the resulting differences between the measured centroids in the two nicmos image epochs .",
    "the solid circle represents the 3-@xmath19 limit as empirically measured by the entire sample of observed sources in the field , with 1@xmath19 being 14 mas / yr and median proper motions of the sample of -17 mas / yr and -8 mas / yr . there is a slight offset in the median change in right ascension of the group of sources from the expected zero value , though it is a @xmath01@xmath19 difference in ra .",
    "this could be because of a bulk proper motion of the background sources , since wd 1620 - 391 is at a low galactic latitude , or a sub pixel mismatch between the reported pixel centers of wd 1620 - 391 .",
    "the magnitude of centroiding errors on hst acquisitions , however , is closer to 7  mas and is smaller than the offset seen here . in any case , there appears to be no co - moving sources , thus completely ruling out any companions down to 6m@xmath12 at separations @xmath1 13  au @xcite .",
    "we can place stringent limits on the types of disks and unresolved companions present for all of our targets . for two of our targets , only planetary mass objects ( m@xmath1114 m@xmath12 ) can be present at all separations , and for the rest , only very low mass brown dwarfs ( m@xmath11 20 m@xmath12 ) can be present at separations @xmath11 1or orbital separations of between 13 and 35  au .",
    "the explanation that all apparently single dazs can be caused by the winds of unseen companions does not fit our results unless the companions are very low mass brown dwarfs or high mass planets .",
    "one would expect to see large amounts of dust present if tidally disrupted planetesimals or ism accretion were the source of metals for dazs .",
    "our targets show no evidence of such dust down to @xmath0 10@xmath48 g if there are optically thin disks present , and out to separations of @xmath00.4 r@xmath30 if there are optically thick disks present .",
    "we effectively rule out optically thick disks like those seen around g  29 - 38 for our targets .",
    "we can not rule out dust that is further away from the white dwarf and consequently much cooler .",
    "sensitive studies at longer wavelengths may yet detect dust around these white dwarfs .    instead",
    ", optically thick dusty disks around dazs seem to be somewhat rare with only 5 such known and no optically thin disks yet reported@xcite .",
    "a lack of optically thick dust can be explained for cooler dazs by infrequent encounters with large planetesimals that create short lived disks that disappear quickly while still allowing detectable metal lines .",
    "for that reason dusty disks should primarily be around hotter das , whose shorter settling times require a quicker replenishment of dust and thus should have long lived disks .",
    "das that are too hot vaporize material well before it is tidally disrupted .",
    "if the disks are instead optically thin , then weaker emission may be present , though currently undetectable .",
    "the upper limits for dust disk masses imply that for many dazs the amount of material close to the white dwarf is sufficient to be detectable spectroscopically , but more difficult to detect in the mid - ir .",
