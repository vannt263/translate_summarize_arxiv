    "the environments of supernova explosion are often inhomogeneous and there may be jumps in their density structure . a massive star can excavate a low density cavity with its energetic stellar wind and ionizing radiation in the circumstellar space before it explodes . it is also possible that supernova may explode in a dense cloud and subsequently break out from the cloud into a low density region .",
    "these supernova remnants ( snrs ) can not be simply treated with the canonical evolutionary laws such as the sedov relation ( sedov 1959 ) . in the former case",
    ", a blast wave collides with a cavity wall after it expands effortlessly into the cavity .",
    "a similar situation has been suggested to have occurred in various supernova remnants such as n132d ( hughes 1987 ) . in the latter case , the blast wave propagates at a higher velocity after it breaks out of the cloud , as is suggested for 3c  391 ( reynolds & moffett 1993 ) .",
    "it would be of interest to develop an analytic model showing how the evolution of such kind of supernova remnants deviates from the canonical solution .    in a study of snr evolution in a dense molecular cloud , wheeler et al.(1980 )",
    "briefly discussed the effect of a pre - sn cavity , suggesting that the remnant will evolve rapidly into the radiative phase after it encounters the cavity wall .",
    "chevalier and liang ( 1989 ) presented a self - similar model for both the structure of the shocked powerlaw ejecta and the shock propagation into the circumstellar shell .",
    "however , the ejecta structure becomes unimportant when the mass swept up by the blast wave significantly exceeds the mass of the ejecta .",
    "investigation of supernova blast waves crossing a density jump has been carried out by hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1991 ) made numerical simulations of the supernova shock interacting with a wind - driven shell ( see also a review by franco et al .",
    "1991 and references therein ) .",
    "tenorio - tagle , bodenheimer , & yorke ( 1985 ) have also presented a numerical simulation of the evolution of a remnant resulting from supernova explosions in or near molecular clouds .",
    "an analytical model would not only complement the numerical simulation , but would allow for exploring a large parameter space and more directly provide physical insights into the evolution of this sort of snrs .",
    "it has been shown by many authors ( e.g. , mccray 1987 , blinnikov , imshennik , & utrobin 1982 , and others ) that a thin - shell model ( kompaneets 1960 ) , though approximate , is convenient and valid in revealing the general evolution of the supernova blast wave . the approach was applied in a numerical algorithm to calculate the evolution of snrs in a density gradient ( see wang et al .",
    "this method has also been applied analytically to other explosive events , e.g. , a cosmic ray blast wave ( morfill & drury 1981 ) .",
    "therefore we use the same approach to obtain an analytic / semi - analytic approximation to seek the basic evolutionary rule of the blast wave after an impact on a cavity wall or a breakout from a cloud .",
    "for the ambient environment of supernova , we assume a density structure of medium @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the number densities of h atoms inside and outside the density jump , respectively ) . in this scenario ,",

    "as long as the asymmetry is reasonably small , our model should still provide a useful approximation . as a general condition , the dynamical response ( characterized by a sound traveling timescale ) due to the non - spherical symmetry of the density jump surface should not be rapid enough compared with the blastwave propagation after crossing the jump surface .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the density jump happens only once .",
    "however , this may not be true for an snr evolving in a stellar wind bubble , for example . in this case , a dense shell , surrounding a low density bubble , may be approximated as two density jumps . in principle , such multiple density jumps can be incorporated into an analytic approach .",
    "but this is a bit too complicated to be included in the present work . here",
    ", we concentrate on exploring the effect of one density jump on the evolution of an snr , which is still evolving in the shell .",
    "this particular situation is important , because of the expected strong density jump effect on the x - ray emission of the snrs .    in the range of applicability discussed here ,",
    "the solutions derived in section 2 can conveniently used in estimating the parameters of relevant supernova remnants .",
    "for example , x - ray observations provide the x - ray luminosity or the volume emission measure of the x - ray emitting gas as well as the gas temperature that is related to the velocity of the blast wave .",

    ", one can derive a relation between this mean temperature and the shock velocity .",
    "this problem may also be resolved to some degree with the spatially resolved spectroscopic data , which allow for the extraction of the spectrum of the freshly - shocked gas . by use of eq.([eq : var2 ] ) ( or eq.[[eq : vrr2 ] ] ) and eq.([eq : rat ] ) ( or eq.[[eq : rrt ] ] ) together with a relation between the volume emission measure and the density of the ambient medium , any three among the five parameters , the density @xmath5 , explosion energy @xmath14 , the age of the remnant @xmath134 , the density contrast @xmath45 , and the fractional radius of the density jump @xmath135 , can be derived from the other two , given the three known parameters , the radius remnant @xmath49 , the shell velocity @xmath136 , and the volume emission measure @xmath137 . according to this recipes , we apply the model developed above to snr n132d that are conjectured to have expanded from a stellar wind cavity into a region of dense medium and derive relevant physical parameters .",
    "n132d , an snr in the large magellanic cloud , lies near the northern boundary of an associated molecular cloud ( banas et al .",
    "the inconsistency between the kinematic age and the sedov dynamical age led to the suggestion that the supernova explosion occurred in a low - density cavity evacuated by the stellar wind and ionizing radiation of a high - mass progenitor ( hughes 1987 ; morse et al .",
    "1996 ; hughes , hayashi , & koyama 1998 ) .",

    "however , quantitive estimates of the evolution of the snr expanding from the cavity into the cavity wall have not yet been carried out because of lack of proper evolutional formulae .",
    "n132d is an oxygen - rich snr but no evidence was found by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) for the presence oxygen - burning products .",
    "this fact was taken by blair et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to suggest a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star which ended at a type ib sn explosion",
    ". however , x - ray data from _ xmm - newton _ ( behar et al .  2001 ;",
    "aschenbach 2002 ) do show the presence of significant proportions of si and fe .",
    "if these elements are actually present in the ejecta , rather than the surrounding ism , this might tend to contradict the scenario of a type ib explosion .",
    "earlier x - ray findings by hwang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) using the focal plane crystal spectrometer on _ einstein _ also found strong fe lines , which the authors used to support the scenario of a massive progenitor ( with masses over @xmath143 favored ) .",
    "therefore we assume that the core collapse sn explosion occurred in a stellar wind cavity blown by a massive progenitor , possibly a wr star .",
    "the recent _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observation of n132d shows a clear shell feature from which most of the ion emission lines arise and a centrally confined fe  k emission charateristic of a high temperature component ( behar et al .",
    "2001 ; aschenbach 2002 ) .",
    "according to the _ asca _  data analysis ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) , the high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath144 ) of the shell comes from the shock interaction with the dense material at the cavity wall , with an x - ray spectral normalization factor @xmath145 , and hence a volume emission measure @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 ) ( hughes et al .  1998 ) .",

    "we consider a scenario in which the blast wave propagates rapidly in the wind cavity until it encounters the cavity wall , where it is slowed down drastically . assuming the swept - up cavity material has been compressed sufficiently , the volume emission measure , under the thin - shell approximation , is given by @xmath153,\\ ] ] where the radius of the remnant @xmath49 is about 12 pc .",

    "in fact , a shocked interstellar cloudlet has been found in the remnant by the _ hst _ ( blair et al .",
    "in addition , the swept - up mass of the cavity gas ( @xmath172 ) suggests that the snr has been in the sedov phase by the time it collides with the cavity wall .",
    "using the thin - shell approximation , we have developed a semi - analytic model for supernova remnants which evolve crossing a density jump in the environmental medium .",
    "the generic evolutionary relations are found for two cases , impact of the blast wave on a cavity wall and breakout of the blast wave from a dense cloud . in the impact case ,",
    "both the adiabatic and radiative phases are investigated ; while in the breakout case , only the adiabatic phase is considered and the evolution relations are found to be an extension of those in the former case with different density contrast . in the impact case , it is also found that the remnant will evolve rapidly into the radiative phase and even the adiabatic phase could last so short that it seems to be abortive if the medium density at the cavity wall is sufficiently high .",

    "<S> the environments of supernova explosion are often inhomogeneous and there may be jumps in their density structure . we have developed a semi - analytic model under the thin - shell approximation for supernova remnants that evolve crossing a density jump in the ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> the generic evolutionary relations are presented for the blast wave after impacting on a cavity wall , which may be produced by the energetic stellar wind from the supernova progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> the relations can also be extended to the case that the blast waves break out from a dense cloud if different density contrast is used . </S>",
    "<S> this model is applied to n132d , a well - known cavity - born supernova remnant whose evolution has not yet been quantitively estimated in a cavity scenario due to lack of model formulae , and self - consistent physical parameters are obtained . </S>"
