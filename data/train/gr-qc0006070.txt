    "<S> since the holes are assumed to be uncharged , one may expect that the main reason for transitions between stationary states is the quantum fluctuation of the gravitational field between the holes : the quantum fluctuation of the gravitational field perturbes the stationary states , a transition occurs , and a graviton is emitted or absorbed spontaneously . since the black holes are assumed to be in a highly - excited state , and therefore relatively far away from each other , we may use the linear field approximation when investigating the perturbative effects caused by the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian of a point particle moving in a weak gravitational field @xmath20 is @xmath21 under the assumptions that @xmath22 , and the particle moves very slowly we may write eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lagrangian ] ) , in si units : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . dropping the term @xmath26 , which is a mere constant </S>",
    "<S> , we may infer that , in the center of mass coordinates , the lagrangian of the black hole pair can be written , in effect , as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vector joining the hole 1 to the hole 2 , and @xmath29 s are defined such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 s are orthonormal basis vectors .    </S>",
    "<S> now , it is easy to see that the terms proportional to @xmath32 represent the gravitational potential energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> these terms should give , when the system is in a highly - excited state , the newtonian potential energy between the holes . </S>",
    "<S> the terms proportional to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in turn , are related to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that transitions from a one stationary state to another are associated with spontaneous emissions or absorptions of gravitons , the only remaining terms , in addition to the newtonian potential energy , are the terms proportional to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> that is because the `` scalar '' and the `` vector '' gravitons proportional to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , can be gauged away , and the physical gravitons correspond to the @xmath35-components of the field @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the lagrangian of our system interacting with spontaneously emitted or absorbed gravitons is @xmath36 hence we find , under the assumption that @xmath34 is small , that the hamiltonian operator of the black hole pair interacting with gravitational radiation is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath29 . in these equations , objects </S>",
    "<S> equipped with hats are operators replacing the corresponding classical quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition rate @xmath40 from the initial state @xmath41 to the final state @xmath42 can be evaluated by means of the golden rule  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evaluation of the transition rate involves quantization of the linearized gravitational field in the radiation gauge where @xmath43 for every @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been performed in the appendix  [ app : a ] , and we find that if exactly one graviton with angular frequency @xmath45 is emitted in a transition , then @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the wave vector of the graviton , @xmath48 its polarization tensor , and @xmath49 is the solid angle into which the graviton emerges . the polarization tensors @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to the two physical polarizations of the graviton have been chosen such that @xmath52 for every @xmath53 . in the lowest order approximation we can write : @xmath54 transitions corresponding to this expression may be viewed as gravitational analogues of the e1 transitions in atomic physics . </S>",
    "<S> we shall therefore call them as g1 transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the next task is to integrate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ transitrate ] ) over all the possible directions into which the gravitons may emerge . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done in appendix  [ app : b ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial state @xmath41 and the final state @xmath42 are taken to be solutions to the schrdinger equation  ( [ sch ] ) of the black hole pair , and one takes into account the fact that gravitons have exactly two independent polarizations , one finds that the integrated transition rate from the state @xmath41 to the state @xmath55 in g1 transitions is @xmath56    from this expression one can obtain the g1 selection rules for the black hole pair . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , one finds the transitions for which the integrated g1 transition rate  ( [ transrate ] ) is non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> since gravitons may be viewed as spin two particles , one might expect that for allowed g1 transitions the angular momentum quantum number @xmath57 as well as the corresponding azimuthal quantum number @xmath58 could change only by zero , or by plus or minus two . a detailed investigation , which has been performed in appendix  [ app : c ] , shows that this is indeed the case : the g1 selection rules are :    [ selrules ] @xmath59    it is straightforward , although very laborious , to calculate the transition rates in allowed g1 transitions from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ transrate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this arduous task , with explicit expressions for transition rates in different g1 transitions , has been performed in appendix d. for instance , if the principal quantum number @xmath15 is of the order of 100 , then it turns out that the transition rates in transitions between nearby states are of the order of @xmath60 1/s , if @xmath61 , and of the order of @xmath62 1/s , if @xmath63 , provided that we assume that the mass @xmath2 is equal to the planck mass @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> transitions between nearby states , however , are not necessarily the most favourable ones . in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 we have plotted the transition rates as functions of @xmath65 , the difference between the initial and the final values of the principal quantum number @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> one finds , for instance , that when @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , then the most favourable transitions are those where @xmath68 , and if , for the same values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then for the most favourable transitions @xmath73 . if @xmath63 and @xmath74 , then @xmath75 for the most favourable transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , planck - size black hole pairs perform extremely rapid transitions from one stationary state to another . </S>",
    "<S> however , the problem is , whether the transitions are propably too rapid so that one can not meaningfully talk about discrete energy eigenstates at all . to answer this question </S>",
    "<S> , one must calculate the life time of an initial state with big @xmath15 , when all the allowed g1 transitions are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the life time of an initial state , in turn , is the inverse of the sum of the transition rates of all the allowed g1 transitions . using the formulas of appendix d , and assuming that transitions from higher to lower states are dominant </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that the life time of an initial state with @xmath15 of the order of 100 , is of the order of @xmath76 if @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this result settles , within the approximations made in this paper , the question about the existence of sharp energy eigenstates . according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle the natural line width of a state with life time @xmath78 is @xmath79 and therefore @xmath80 however , the energy difference between nearby states is , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltae ] ) : @xmath81 and therefore : @xmath82 in other words , the uncertainty of the energy eigenvalues of the system is very much smaller than the energy difference between nearby states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the energy spectrum appears to be discrete , at least as far as one can trust in the approximations made in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between discrete energy eigenstates are extremely rapid , and the energies released are enormous .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated microscopic schwarzschild black hole pairs revolving around their common center of mass . </S>",
    "<S> considering the holes as point - like objects interacting with the newtonian gravitational force , we quantized the system and studied the stationary energy levels when the system is in a highly - excited state . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculated , by means of perturbative methods , the transition rates and life times in a certain class of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations were based on the quantization of the linearized gravitational field in the radiation gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained , in the lowest order approximation , explicit expressions for the transition rates and evaluated the transition rates numerically when the pricipal quantum number @xmath83 , and the mass of a microscopic black hole is assumed to be one planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the transition rates are of the order of @xmath84 1/s for allowed transitions , and the life times of energy eigenstates are of the order of @xmath0 s. gravitons with energies of the order of @xmath1 ev , or even greater , are emitted in these very rapid transitions between discrete energy eigenstates .    </S>",
    "<S> no doubt , one might be justified to have some feelings of suspicion towards the validity of the approximations on which this paper is based . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it may well be somewhat daring to apply newton s ancient theory of gravitation to microscopic black holes ! however , </S>",
    "<S> if one accepts the view that , in the classical level , einstein s general theory of relativity is the correct theory of gravitation ( so far we have no experimental evidence suggesting that the things could be otherwise ) , having newton s theory as its non - relativistic limit , one is also forced to accept the `` newtonian approximation '' made in this paper : holes with @xmath77 move , if @xmath83 , with velocities which are of the order of @xmath85 and the expectation value of their mutual distance is about @xmath86 times their schwarzschild radius . of course </S>",
    "<S> , one could calculate general relativistic corrections to energy levels and transition rates but as far as one is interested in mere order - of - magnitude estimates , newton s theory should be sufficiently accurate . </S>",
    "<S> quite another matter is , whether the first order perturbative quantum theory of linearized general relativity is sufficiently accurate an approximation of quantum gravity for the evaluation of transition rates and life times . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the energies of the emitted or absorbed gravitons are well below the planck energy , which is the case at least for transitions between nearby states when @xmath87 , however , one might be inclined to rely on the approximations made in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the basic lessons one can learn from this paper is that enormous energies could be relased by means of the quantum effects of the gravitational field : the energies released in transitions between the energy eigenstates of the microscopic black hole pair are , even in the transitions between nearby states when @xmath88 , about fourteen orders of magnitude greater that the energies typically released in nuclear phenomena , and yet we are talking about a microscopic system .    </S>",
    "<S> it appears to us that the only conceivable way how microscopic black hole pairs could be formed is a pairing of black hole remnants which are left as the end products of hawking evaporation of primordial black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of black hole remnants is a controversial question  @xcite , although it is possible to construct mathematically consistent quantum theories of black holes where the ground state energy of the hole is positive ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . if such remnants exist , however , it is possible that some of them form pairs . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that if the masses of the remnants are of the order of planck mass , extremely energetic gravitons are emitted in very rapid transitions from one state to another . </S>",
    "<S> some of these very energetic gravitons , in turn , may materialize into observable particles producing cosmic rays with very high energies . measuring the amount of very energetic cosmic rays </S>",
    "<S> could therefore be used when trying to estimate the abundance of black hole remnants in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> if there are black hole pairs formed by black hole remnants with masses of the order of planck mass , one expects to observe cosmic rays with energies of the order of @xmath89 ev , or even greater .    </S>",
