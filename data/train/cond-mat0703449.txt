    "onset of chaos immensely complicates the details of the scattering process as reflected in the paradigm of compound nucleus . at low energies ,",
    "the long - lived resonance states are exceedingly complex superpositions in the basis of independent particles . as energy increases",
    ", the scattering pattern evolves from the set of narrow isolated resonances to overlapping resonances and strongly fluctuating cross sections .",
    "since the individual properties of resonances can not be predicted , only statistical description is practical and sensible .",
    "the average cross sections are usually described according to hauser - feshbach @xcite , while the fluctuations and correlations of cross sections are treated in terms of ericson theory @xcite .",
    "standard theory of statistical reactions does not answer the question of interplay between reactions and internal structure determined by the character of interactions between the constituents . here",
    "more detailed considerations are required based on the generalization of the shell model of nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "such an extension introduces statistical assumptions concerning intrinsic dynamics and its coupling to the continuum @xcite with the extreme limiting case of intrinsic chaos modelled by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite .",
    "an important element is still missing here , namely the transitional regime from separated to overlapping resonances . the consistent description based on the continuum shell model @xcite , as well as more phenomenological approaches @xcite ,",
    "indicate the presence of a sharp restructuring of the system when the widths of resonances become comparable to their energy spacings .",
    "this phenomenon carries features of a quantum phase transition with the strength of continuum coupling playing the role of a control parameter .",
    "as was clearly observed in the shell model framework @xcite , the distribution of resonance widths rapidly changes in the transitional region in such a way that a number of very broad resonances equal to a number of open decay channels absorb the lion s share of the total width of all overlapped resonances , while the remaining states become very narrow .",
    "the corresponding theory was suggested in @xcite , where the mechanism of this restructuring was understood to be associated with the nature of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite that describes the intrinsic dynamics after eliminating the channel variables .",
    "the factorized structure of this hamiltonian , in turn , is dictated by the unitarity of the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "one can compare this phenomenon to the classical factorized model @xcite of a giant resonance , where the collective strength of many particle - hole states is shifted in energy and concentrated at a specific combination of excited states . in spite of formal analogy ,",
    "physics under study here is different .",
    "the concentration of widths on a few broad states can be described as collectivization along the _ imaginary axis _ in the complex energy plane .",
    "the driving force of this restructuring is the presence of open decay channels and interaction of intrinsic states through the continuum .",
    "the intrinsic hermitian interaction is present as well and should be fully accounted for ; one of the goals of our study is to understand the dependence of the continuum picture on the strength and character of interactions inside the closed system .",
    "the interplay of two collectivities is an interesting subject @xcite practically important in relation to the so - called pygmy - resonances in loosely bound systems @xcite .",
    "the segregation of short - lived broad resonances from long - lived trapped states was shown to be similar to the superradiance @xcite in quantum optics induced by the coupling of atomic radiators through the common radiation field , an analog of coherent coupling of many overlapped intrinsic states through continuum .",
    "later a general character of the phenomenon was demonstrated for systems with goe intrinsic dynamics and many open channels @xcite .",
    "modern versions of the shell model in continuum @xcite are based on the effective hamiltonian and naturally reveal the superradiance phenomenon as an important element .",
    "the transition to this regime should be taken into account in all cases when a physical system is strongly coupled to the continuum , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "the segregation of scales is spectacularly seen in level and width statistics @xcite . even for goe",
    "intrinsic dynamics , the probability @xmath0 of very small spacings between the centroids of resonances does not vanish because of energy uncertainty of unstable states .",
    "the width distribution reveals the separation of the  cloud \" of superradiant states far from the real energy axis , while the trapped states are clearly accumulated near the real axis .",
    "some features of the picture are however sensitive to the character and strength of intrinsic interactions as we have demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "the analysis included the two - body random ensemble of variable interaction strength in a fermi system of shell - model type and the goe as an extreme limit of many - body random interaction .",
    "in the present work , using the same framework as in @xcite , we study the interplay between the intrinsic dynamics and statistical properties of cross sections comparing the results with those of conventional approaches , namely hauser - feshbach average cross sections and ericson fluctuations and correlations .",
    "in particular , we show that the assumption that fluctuations of the resonance widths are negligible for a large number of channels is not correct .",
    "we also show that the elastic enhancement factor strongly depends on the degree of chaoticity inside the system , thus leading to deviations from the hauser - feshbach formula .",

    "the scattering matrix ( [ 13 ] ) averaged over the ensemble of decay amplitudes ( [ 2 ] ) with accuracy of @xmath80 , is given by @xcite @xmath81 following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume , in concordance with the statistical ansatz ( [ 2 ] ) , that the decay amplitudes and the eigenvalues @xmath78 of the intrinsic hamiltonian are statistically independent .",
    "this assumption is satisfied for the goe and poissonian ensembles , and here we assume that this is also true for the tbre .    since the mean field many - body basis @xmath4 and the eigenbasis @xmath82 of the intrinsic hermitian hamiltonian are related by a real orthogonal transformation , the anti - hermitian part @xmath13 of the effective hamiltonian in the basis @xmath82 still has a factorized form in terms of the new amplitudes @xmath83 ; similarly to eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , the correlation function of the amplitudes @xmath84 coincides with that given by eq .",

( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the average scattering matrix ( [ 14 ] ) takes the form @xmath93 that depends only on our parameter of continuum coupling independently of the intrinsic interaction strength @xmath94 .",
    "this independence is due to the fact that we normalized @xmath95 to the mean level spacing , @xmath41 , but it is important to stress that in the shell model @xmath41 does depend on the intrinsic interaction @xcite .",
    "eq.([18 ] ) implies that the transmission coefficient , @xmath96 is also independent of this strength , @xmath97 the transmission coefficient in the channel @xmath98 , @xmath99 , is maximum ( equal to 1 ) at the critical point of this channel , @xmath100 , when the average @xmath79-matrix vanishes .",

    "we restrict our statistical analysis to a small energy interval with a constant level density at the center of the real spectrum of the complex eigenvalues of @xmath59 .",
    "this interval should be small enough in order to neglect the energy - dependent difference of the density of states among the ensembles , but large enough with respect to the widths in order to contain a statistically meaningful number of resonances .    for a model with a finite resonance number ,",

    "the fact that large deviations from the conventional theory ( for finite values of @xmath7 ) should be expected in the elastic case were recognized also in refs .",
    "the comparison between @xmath235 and @xmath109 cases indicate that it is natural to assume that with a further increase of @xmath7 both the distributions will converge to the exponential one .",

    "our results for the normalized variance ( see below ) , indeed , confirm a presence of this weak dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "the above data for the distribution of the normalized fluctuational cross section may be treated as a kind of confirmation of the ericson fluctuation theory .",
    "however , it should be stressed that if we are interested in the fluctuations of non - normalized cross sections ( at least , for elastic cross sections ) , one should take into account the dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "currently no theory allows one to obtain the corresponding analytical results , even for the situation where the number of channels is sufficiently large .",

    "[ flucteline ] .",
    "one can treat this effect as manifesting that both the variance and the square of the cross section average depend on @xmath94 practically in the same way .",
    "therefore , their ratio turns out to be almost independent on @xmath94 . as one can see , although the standard predictions are not correct for the non - normalized variance , they are in a good correspondence with the data for the normalized variance .      here we compare our results for the correlation function of cross sections and the scattering matrix with the standard predictions , see section v. the correlation functions for the cross section and for the scattering matrix were computed according to eqs .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied the statistics of cross sections for a fermion system coupled to open decay channels . for the first time we carefully followed various signatures of the crossover from isolated to overlapping resonances in dependence on the strength of inter - particle interaction modelled here by the two - body random ensemble .",
    "the study was performed for the simplest gaussian ensemble of decay amplitudes . even in this limiting case , when these amplitudes were considered as uncorrelated with the intrinsic dynamics , we found significant dependence of reaction observables on the strength of intrinsic interaction .",
    "we expect this dependence to be amplified with realistic interplay of decay amplitudes and internal wave functions .",
    "such studies should be performed in the future .",
    "a detailed comparison has been carried out of our results with standard predictions of statistical reaction theory .",
    "the average cross section was compared with the hauser - feshbach formula for a large number of channels . in the inelastic case",
    "this description works quite well in the overlapping resonance regime for any interaction strength , while in the elastic case strong deviations have been found if the intrinsic motion is not fully chaotic .",
    "the study of ericson fluctuation theory shows that the assumption that the fluctuations of the resonance widths become negligible for a large number of channels is wrong in the overlapping regime .",
    "we found that the fluctuations of resonance widths increase with the coupling to the continuum , and we gave evidence that the relative fluctuation of the width ( the ratio of the variance to the square of the average width ) diverges at @xmath101 for any number of channels .",
    "this should imply that for any number of channels the differences from the standard theory should increase as @xmath95 increases .    in order to study the relationship between the variance of the cross section and its average value , it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the average cross section on the intrinsic interaction strength @xmath94 .",
    "even when this is done , the standard prediction about the variance of the cross section was found to be a good approximation only for a very large number of channels . for @xmath7 between @xmath269 and @xmath270 , where the ericson prediction could be expected to be valid ,",
    "consistent deviations have been demonstrated .",
    "in particular , the distribution of cross sections shows that the probability of a large value of the cross section , mainly for the elastic case ( or in the presence of direct reactions ) , can be well below conventional predictions .    finally , we have shown that , in agreement with previous studies , the correlation length differs from the average width for any number of channels .",
    "on the other hand , the weisskopf relation ( [ 62 ] ) that connects the correlation length of the cross section to the transmission coefficient , works , for a large number of channels , at any value of the intrinsic interaction strength @xmath94 . in many situations",
    "we have seen that increase of @xmath94 in fact suppresses the fluctuations in the continuum .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively as a manifestation of many - body chaos that makes all internal states uniformly mixed .",
    "our results can be applied to any many - fermion system coupled to the continuum of open decay channels .",
    "the natural applications first of all should cover neutron resonances in nuclei , where rich statistical material was accumulated but the transitional region from isolated to overlapped resonances was not studied in detail .",
    "the interesting applications of a similar approach to molecular electronics and electron tunneling spectroscopy can be found in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "other open mesoscopic systems , for example , quantum dots and quantum wires , should be analyzed as well in the crossover region .",
    "one can expect very promising designated studies for checking the statistical properties of resonances in such controllable experiments as those in microwave cavities and in acoustical chaos .",
