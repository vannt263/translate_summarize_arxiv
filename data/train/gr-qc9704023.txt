    "it is well known that a neutron star has a rich pulsation spectrum @xcite .",
    "we expect the stellar pulsation modes to be excited in many neutron star processes ( ranging from core quakes to the formation of a neutron star through gravitational collapse ) .",
    "a signal carrying the signature of these modes could , if detected by future gravitational - wave antennaes , provide useful information about the star .",
    "the question is whether the various stellar pulsation modes can be dynamically excited to a level that makes them astrophysically relevant .",
    "this question is especially interesting because of the existence of `` spacetime '' modes @xcite , which have no analogue in the newtonian theory of stellar pulsation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these modes , together with the normal fluid pulsation modes , can provide valuable information about the mass , size , and equation of state of neutron stars .",
    "much of the initial deformation of spacetime in e.g. a supernova collapse could conceivably be released through spacetime pulsation modes , yet most studies of neutron star formation and pulsation have not treated them because they have been done within the newtonian or post - newtonian approximations .    with the present paper",
    "we take the first steps towards an answer to the question of mode - excitation .",
    "we describe numerical evolutions of the equations that describe a perturbed relativistic star for various sets of initial data .",
    "evolutions of the perturbation equations for black holes have provided interesting information ( see @xcite for references ) , and it seems likely that this approach should prove equally instructive for stars .",
    "our main focus is on the evolution problem itself : we formulate the problem and discuss all relevant equations in some detail .",
    "we also present results from two test problems , which indicate that for a range of initial conditions the energy emitted is shared broadly among the pulsation and spacetime modes .",
    "this argues strongly , if in a preliminary way , that neutron - star dynamical calculations done within the newtonian and post - newtonian approximations may seriously underestimate the amount and the spectral character of the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the linear perturbation problems for a neutron star in general relativity as an initial - value problem , with special attention to the boundary conditions and the treatment of the center of the star . in section iii",
    "we solve the initial - value problem numerically for two sets of initial conditions , which represent in some sense the extremes of the balance between exciting fluid modes on the one hand and spacetime modes on the other .",
    "the spectrum of the gravitational waves generated from these initial data show clearly the signatures of both the fluid modes and the spacetime modes .",
    "importantly , in both sets the excitation of the spacetime modes is appreciable . in section",
    "iv we discuss the significance of the results , and our plans for future work to determine a more realistic initial - data set to use for such calculations .",
    "we begin by providing , in the remainder of section i , a more detailed motivation for this work in the context of numerical relativity and gravitational wave detection , and a brief background on relativistic stellar pulsation theory with special focus on recent developments .      with the building of several large - scale laser interferometers for gravitational - wave detection well under way @xcite `` gravitational - wave astronomy ''",
    "may be established around the turn of the century .",
    "but many fundamental problems remain to be solved before this goal can be reached . for the theorist , the most pressing problems concern modeling the processes which generate gravitational waves . only by comparing observational data to such models",
    "can we hope to infer detailed information about the various gravitational - wave sources .",
    "promising sources for detectable gravitational waves are the coalescence of compact binaries ( that is , the spiraling collision of a binary system containing neutron stars and/or black holes ) and supernovae collapse @xcite .",
    "a complete description of these strong field , highly asymmetric processes requires fully relativistic 3-dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "there is currently a `` grand challenge '' project underway in the usa to simulate the 3-dimensional spiraling coalescence of black holes @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the head - on ( axisymmetric ) collision of two black holes have already been performed @xcite , providing preliminary estimates for the gravitational - wave efficiency of this process .",
    "these calculations indicate that the quasinormal modes of the final black hole dominate the emerging radiation .",
    "simulations of processes involving neutron stars have ( with a few exceptions ) so far used newtonian gravity@xcite , see the discussion in section iiic .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulties of consistently treating both the matter and the gravitational field within the framework of the standard adm formalism . in these newtonian simulations",
    "the gravitational radiation is calculated using the quadrupole formula .",
    "that is , gravitational waves originate solely from stellar fluid motion  there is no contribution from the dynamics of the gravitational field itself .",
    "however , the dynamics of the gravitational field should also contribute to the emerging gravitational radiation .",
    "this is clear from the black hole case , in which the quasinormal - mode oscillations are entirely due to the dynamical spacetime @xcite . at an intuitive level one would expect similar features to exist for stars , although they are probably less dominant since a neutron star is less relativistic than a black hole . as we describe below this",
    "is , indeed , the case .",
    "there is a set of pulsation modes of a relativistic star that can be directly associated with the spacetime curvature .",
    "but it is not yet known how important the spacetime contribution to the gravitational - wave emission will be in a dynamical scenario .",
    "there is growing optimism in the numerical relativity community over the feasibility of simulating neutron stars within general relativity .",
    "this is mainly due to the recent development of `` hyperbolic formalisms '' for vacuum relativity into which relativistic hydrodynamics fits naturally .",
    "there is now another `` grand challenge '' project in the usa designated to simulate binary neutron star coalescence , and there are plans in europe to simulate supernovae collapse  both fully relativistically . while such projects are ultimately the only way to provide reliable gravitational - wave estimates , the first results will not be available for some years .",
    "in the meantime , we must resort to approximate methods such as post - newtonian expansions and perturbation theory .",
    "these methods can provide valuable information about the early and late time behaviour of the system .",
    "the present paper describes a project to investigate the excitation of the stellar pulsation modes using perturbation theory .",
    "we recall that non - linear numerical calculations for black holes have shown that the quasinormal modes tend to be clearly present in the radiation .",
    "furthermore , comparisons with non - linear calculations have indicated that the more tractable linear approximations can provide accurate waveforms for a wide range of initial data .",
    "a particularly interesting example of this is the `` close - limit '' approximation for colliding black holes @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that perturbation calculations will also be a useful tool for problems involving relativistic stars .",
    "the relative simplicity of the perturbation approach compared to the full non - linear calculations makes its application and interpretation easier .",
    "we can hope to learn some of the relevant physics by pursuing the perturbation approach . in the near future , while non - linear codes are still being developed , approximate studies can lead the way .",
    "a further benefit from this work is its application as a test for the full non - linear codes for simulations of stellar processes .",
    "one can immediately identify two ways in which results of a fully relativistic numerical simulation should agree with a perturbation result , and in the case of black holes these tests are well established : i ) extract asymmetric perturbations of the final spacetime from the numerical waveforms and compare these perturbations to the anticipated quasinormal modes , cf .",
    "ii ) apply the fully non - linear code to `` linear initial data '' and compare the results with an independent perturbation calculation @xcite .",
    "the study of stellar pulsation in a general relativistic context has a considerable history , dating back to the fundamental work of thorne and his colleagues in the late 1960 s @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "originally , the stellar pulsation problem was approached from a `` newtonian '' viewpoint . in this picture , motion in the stellar fluid generates gravitational waves which carry energy away from the system .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of the various pulsation modes of the star thus become complex valued . due to the weak coupling between matter and gravitational waves the damping rate of a typical pulsation mode",
    "is very low @xcite .",
    "this `` newtonian '' picture is limited in that the dynamical properties of the spacetime itself are neglected . that a dynamic spacetime can add new features to the pulsation problem",
    "can be understood in terms of a simple , but instructive , model problem due to kokkotas and schutz @xcite .",
    "there are pulsation modes directly associated with spacetime itself .",
    "these new modes have been termed `` gravitational - wave modes '' ( or @xmath2-modes ) @xcite .",
    "they have relatively high oscillation frequencies ( 6 - 14 khz for typical neutron stars ) and barely excite any fluid motion .",
    "they are also rapidly damped , with a typical lifetime of a fraction of a millisecond .",
    "our understanding of the @xmath2-modes has improved with a body of recent work @xcite .",
    "a present conjecture @xcite is that three ( more or less distinct ) classes of gravitational - wave modes exist : i ) curvature modes ; that arise when gravitational waves are trapped in the bowl of curvature associated with the star , ii ) interface modes ; that are closely linked to the stellar surface , and iii ) trapped modes ; that arise when the star is so compact ( @xmath3 ) that the peak of the exterior curvature potential ( familiar from the black - hole problem ) is unveiled .",
    "the existence of pulsation modes that are directly associated with the spacetime itself is interesting from a theoretical point of view , but it is necessary to establish if these modes are of astrophysical significance @xcite .",
    "one can argue that the gravitational - wave modes could be relevant in many scenarios .",
    "consider , for example , gravitational collapse to a neutron star , or the coalescence of two neutron stars . in both cases",
    "will there be changes in the deformation of spacetime , which could potentially lead to considerable amounts of energy being radiated through the @xmath2-modes .",
    "detailed calculations are needed to provide quantitative information .",
    "in essence , there are two important questions that must addressed : i ) will the gravitational - wave modes be excited in processes such as supernova collapse or neutron star coalescence ?",
    "ii ) what is the possibility of observing such modes in data from the new generation of gravitational - wave detectors , and what physical information could such observations provide ?    as an initial attempt to answer the first question , we studied scattering of wave - packets by a uniform density star @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem of great astrophysical importance ( it is difficult to imagine a situation where the impinging gravitational wave has sufficient magnitude to make the scattered wave observable ) but the results were nevertheless encouraging .",
    "the resultant gravitational waves show the clear signature of the @xmath2-modes for neutron star sized objects ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "similar results have since been obtained for a particle falling in the stellar spacetime @xcite .",
    "the present paper describes more detailed work along these lines : we evolve the perturbation equations from general initial data .",
    "most importantly , our analysis is not restricted to an initial perturbation with compact support in the vacuum outside the star . to construct our stellar model",
    "we use a polytropic equation of state .",
    "contrary to the simple uniform density model , polytropes allow several fluid pulsation modes to exist ( the single @xmath0-mode and an infinite sequence of @xmath1-modes ) . our aim is to demonstrate that our expectations regarding the excitation of the stellar pulsation modes are reasonable , and that these modes should be considered as a source for detectable gravitational waves .",
    "the second question  the possibility of extracting information from a detected pulsation mode  has been considered by andersson and kokkotas @xcite .",
    "their preliminary investigation suggests that one may be able to extract the mass and the radius of a perturbed star using observed mode - signals .",
    "such information can help put constraints on the nuclear equation of state .",
    "in this section we describe the stellar perturbation problem",
    ". we will introduce all the necessary equations but not discuss their origin in great detail . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to previous work@xcite .",
    "it is relevant to point out that most of the existing work on perturbations of stars has been performed in the frequency domain ( after fourier decomposition of the various perturbed quantities ) .",
    "this is the natural approach as long as one is mainly interested in the spectral properties of a star .",
    "kind , ehlers and schmidt @xcite appear to be the only authors that have considered relativistic stellar perturbations as an initial value problem .",
    "( perturbations of a time - dependent geometry were considered by seidel et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of gravitational collapse ) .",
    "the motivation of kind et al . was to show that initial cauchy data with the appropriate junction conditions at the stellar surface determines a unique solution to the time - dependent equations .",
    "thus , kind _ et al . _",
    "address important mathematical questions for the stellar evolution problem .",
    "the motivation of the present investigation is rather different , but our formulation of the problem is still inspired by @xcite .",
    "a static spherically symmetric stellar model can be described by the metric @xmath5 where the metric coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 only .",
    "specifically , @xmath9 and the `` mass inside radius @xmath8 '' is represented by @xmath10 this means that the total mass of the star is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the stars radius .",
    "( we use geometric units @xmath13 throughout this paper . )    a star in hydrostatic equilibrium is governed by the tov equations : to determine a stellar model we must solve @xmath14 where @xmath15 these equations do , of course , require an equation of state @xmath16 as input . in this paper",
    "we consider ( for reasons of simplicity ) only polytropic equations of state @xmath17 in particular , we present numerical results for a model with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have performed calculations using different parameters but , since the results were similar to those discussed in section iiib , we will only discuss one stellar model in detail .",
    "the specific model we have chosen has a central density @xmath20 g/@xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding radius and mass are @xmath22 km and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the pulsation properties of this stellar model have already been investigated in detail previously @xcite .",
    "a general description of the stellar perturbation problem is as follows : we want to solve the perturbed einstein equations @xmath24 the small amplitude motion that a perturbation induces in the stellar fluid is described by displacements @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the fluid displacement affects also the pressure and the density of the fluid . to describe these we use the eulerian variations @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as is familiar from black - hole problems@xcite , the perturbed metric can be split into two classes : axial and polar ( often called odd and even parity ) perturbations .",
    "that is , the metric can be written @xmath30 if we work in regge - wheeler gauge ( which has been used for most of the previous studies of the stellar problem ) the axial perturbations are described by four variables linked to the metric coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these perturbations induce a differential rotation of the star where the only non - zero component of the fluid - displacement vector is @xmath27 .",
    "the polar metric perturbations correspond to six variables related to the metric coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 together with the fluid displacements @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "exactly as for black holes , it turns out that the equations that govern the axial and the polar quantities decouple in the case of a nonrotating star ( this will not be the case if the star is rotating@xcite )",
    ". we thus have two problems that can be approached separately .    in this paper",
    "we only consider the polar problem .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "we have recently considered the initial - value problem for axial perturbations of a uniform density star @xcite .",
    "because an axial perturbation does not induce pulsations in the stellar fluid @xcite we do not expect the results for a more realistic stellar model to be dramatically different from those for uniform density . basically , an axial perturbation can only result in the excitation of @xmath2-modes , and as long as the two stars have similar compactness ( @xmath41 ) the corresponding frequencies are quite similar for a uniform density star and a more realistic model @xcite .",
    "hence , we focus on the polar problem here .",
    "the polar problem corresponds to seven perturbed field equations and three equations of motion for four metric perturbations and four fluid variables@xcite . at first this",
    "would seem to be an overdetermined problem , but this is not the case .",
    "three of our original equations ( the equations of motion , say ) are void of new information because of the bianchi identities .",
    "moreover , we can use @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the acoustic wave - speed in the stellar fluid .",
    "we are thus left with seven equations for seven unknown variables .",
    "there are many possible formulations of the perturbation problem , even within the regge - wheeler gauge , and it is difficult to predict if a specific one may be advantageous from the point of view of numerical evolutions .",
    "here we have chosen a formulation based on the expected physics of the system .",
    "that is , we consider a set of wave - equations describing gravitational waves coupled to acoustic waves in the stellar fluid .",
    "furthermore , we have cast the `` spacetime '' equations into a form which resembles the more familiar equations for black - hole perturbations .",
    "this facilitates a comparison between the two problems .",
    "the perturbed einstein equations and the fluid equations of motion can be manipulated into a set of evolution equations for a reduced number of variables .",
    "the remaining spacetime and fluid perturbations are determined ( at all times ) by a number of constraint equations .",
    "here we evolve two spacetime variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are related to the metric perturbations by @xmath46 these functions are related to the standard regge - wheeler functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) by @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "we also evolve a fluid function ( the perturbed relativistic enthalpy ) @xmath51 which clearly is defined only inside the star . in these definitions of @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we have suppressed the angular dependence @xcite .",
    "the above variables are not obvious , but we have good reasons for introducing them .",
    "let us first consider the function @xmath54 .",
    "when we introduce this function , and also use the standard definition of the `` tortoise coordinate '' @xmath55 we find that @xcite @xmath56 s            \\nonumber \\\\ & = &             -{{4 e^{2\\nu}}\\over r^5 } \\left [       { { ( m+4\\pi p r^3)^2 } \\over { ( r-2 m ) } } + 4\\pi \\rho r^3 - 3 m \\right ] f \\ ,   \\label{swave } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "we thus have a simple wave - equation with no explicit dependency on the perturbations of the fluid . for the other `` metric '' variable @xmath58",
    "we find @xcite @xmath59 f       \\nonumber \\\\ & = &            - 2\\left [ 4 \\pi r^2 ( p+\\rho ) - e^{-\\lambda } \\right ] s            +   8 \\pi ( \\rho+p ) { r e^{\\nu } }               \\left(1- { 1\\over c_s^2 } \\right ) h \\ .",
    "\\label{gwave } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is also quite simple , but here the coupling to the fluid variable @xmath53 is apparent . both of our wave equations are valid inside the star as well as in the exterior vacuum . in the exterior",
    "the mass @xmath60 is , obviously , the total mass @xmath61 .",
    "our reason for introducing @xmath54 and @xmath58 should now be apparent : in terms of these variables the perturbation equations become similar to the wave - equation that governs a perturbed schwarzschild black hole @xcite , or the equation for axial perturbations of a star@xcite .",
    "that the polar equations can be cast in a similar form has not been shown previously .    the equation that governs the fluid variable @xmath53 is , however , still somewhat messy .",
    "after some algebra we find that @xcite @xmath62           { { \\partial h}\\over { \\partial r _ * } }           \\nonumber \\\\     & + & { { 2 e^\\nu}\\over r^2 }        \\left [ 2 \\pi r^2 ( \\rho+p)\\left(3 + { 1\\over { c_s^2 } } \\right )        - ( n+1 ) \\right ] h        \\nonumber \\\\        & = & ( m+4 \\pi p r^3)\\left(1-{1\\over { c_s^2}}\\right )        { { e^{(\\lambda-\\nu)/2}}\\over { 2 r } }        \\left [            { { e^\\nu}\\over r^2}{{\\partial f}\\over { \\partial r _ * } }           -   { { \\partial s}\\over { \\partial r _ * } }        \\right ]        \\nonumber \\\\ & + &        \\left [         { { ( m+4\\pi p r^3)^2}\\over{r^2(r-2m)}}\\left(1+{1\\over { c_s^2}}\\right ) -         { { m+4\\pi p r^3    } \\over{2 r^2 }     } \\left(1-{1\\over { c_s^2}}\\right )         -4\\pi r ( 3p+\\rho )         \\right ] s         \\nonumber \\\\ & + &        { { e^\\nu}\\over r^2}\\left [        { { 2(m+4\\pi p r^3)^2}\\over{r^2(r-2m)}}{1\\over { c_s^2 } } -         { { m+4\\pi p r^3    } \\over{2 r^2 } } \\left(1-{1\\over { c_s^2 } } \\right )         -4\\pi r ( 3p+\\rho )         \\right ] f   \\ . \\label{hwave } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally we have the hamiltonian constraint @xcite @xmath63 f   \\nonumber \\\\   & - & r e^{-(\\nu+\\lambda)/2}{{\\partial s}\\over { \\partial r _ * } } +   \\left[8\\pi r^2(\\rho+p )",

    "we will discuss this constraint in more detail in section iiia .    here",
    "it could be worthwhile to note that it is possible to find a new `` fluid '' variable such that the corresponding wave equation [ that would replace ( [ hwave ] ) ] contains no first derivatives . however , this extra step is not convenient because it involves the solution of a differential equation involving @xmath64 .",
    "it is also meaningful to comment on the number of equations that we use .",
    "it is well known that the interior problem for polar perturbations can be reduced to two coupled wave equations @xcite .",
    "it would be easy to use ( [ hamilton ] ) to replace @xmath53 in ( [ gwave ] ) ( as was done by ipser and price @xcite and kojima@xcite ) .",

    "it is also useful to keep one fluid variable explicit . with the equations for @xmath54 , @xmath58 , and @xmath53 above we can easily monitor the fluid motion during the evolution .",
    "moreover , kind _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that our problem is well posed ( that a unique solutions exists ) .",
    "let us now turn to the exterior problem . in the vacuum outside the star the problem is identical to that for a perturbed schwarzschild black hole .",
    "thus , the equations simplify considerably , and we only need to consider the two equations for @xmath54 and @xmath58 ( note that the two effective potentials are equal in the exterior vacuum ) .",
    "furthermore , we know from the studies of perturbed black holes that we can reduce the problem even further .",
    "we only need to consider one single homogeneous wave equation  the zerilli equation @xcite .",
    "if we define@xcite @xmath66 we find that @xmath67 evolves according to @xmath68 where the effective potential is given by @xmath69\\ ] ]    this equation has the advantage that the function @xmath67 is gauge - invariant and unconstrained @xcite .",
    "but from the point of view of a numerical evolution it may be preferable to solve the coupled system for @xmath54 and @xmath58  the variables that are used inside the star  rather than switching to the zerilli equation in the exterior .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that it is trivial to obtain gauge - invariant ( but constrained ) quantities from @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "if we use @xmath70 and @xmath71 to denote the gauge invariant variables that were first introduced by seidel @xcite , we find that @xmath72 these equations prescribe how the gauge invariant quantities can be generated from the specific functions that we solve for in regge - wheeler gauge .",
    "it is straightforward to generate @xmath70 and @xmath71 once we know @xmath54 and @xmath58 ( or the standard regge - wheeler functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "furthermore , for the fluid variable one finds that @xmath29 in regge - wheeler gauge corresponds immediately to the gauge - invariant variable @xmath75 that was used by seidel @xcite .      when evolving the perturbation equations one must give special consideration to the behaviour of the variables close to the centre and the surface of the star .",
    "to infer the behaviour at the centre is relatively easy because we know that , for a physical solution , all the perturbed variables should be regular at @xmath76 .",
    "working in the fourier domain and expanding all variables in powers of @xmath8 ( as was done by lindblom and detweiler @xcite ) we can infer that @xmath77    we also need to deduce the behaviour of the various functions at the surface of the star .",
    "we must implement the usual junction conditions @xcite for the spacetime functions at @xmath78 , and also impose a boundary condition on the fluid variable @xmath53 .",
    "( it is , of course , also necesssary to specify the behaviour of @xmath54 and @xmath58 as @xmath79 .",
    "but this is easy since the two functions should correspond to purely outgoing waves far away from the star . )",
    "the surface of the star is formally defined by the vanishing of the lagrangian variation in the pressure @xmath80 .",
    "that is , at the surface we have @xmath81 this immediately leads to @xmath82 as @xmath83 , or @xmath84 in principle , this constitutes a boundary condition for @xmath53 at the surface of the star , but in practice this result is not very helpful .",
    "first of all we are not explicitly calculating @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , it is known from newtonian pulsation theory that @xmath25 is not constrained at the surface of the star ( it need only be non - singular ) .",
    "thus , the vanishing of @xmath80 as @xmath83 does not lead to a useful boundary condition for the fluid variable @xmath53 .",
    "however , it is known that a proper solution to einstein s equations will enforce the vanishing of @xmath80 at the surface of the star .",
    "any solution that follows from our system of equations should therefore be acceptable .",
    "this means that the behaviour of @xmath53 at @xmath78 can be inferred from ( [ hwave ] ) .",
    "however , because the sound speed @xmath43 vanishes as @xmath83 it is not convenient to use equation ( [ hwave ] ) close to the surface .",
    "instead we infer the behaviour of @xmath53 at the stellar surface by taking the limit @xmath85 in ( [ hwave ] ) . keeping only terms of order @xmath86",
    "we get @xmath87 at @xmath78 .",
    "we use this equation to evolve @xmath53 at the surface of the star .",
    "let us now consider the behaviour of the two `` metric '' variables at @xmath78 . from the junction conditions ( the continuity of the first and second fundamental forms across the surface of the star @xcite ) we find that @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath88 are continuous at @xmath78 .",
    "that is , if we let subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent functions obtained for the interior and the exterior , respectively , we have @xmath91 it is also apparent from ( [ swave ] ) that these conditions imply @xmath92 as long as @xmath93 as @xmath83 .",
    "this means that all terms in ( [ swave ] ) are well defined at the boundary , and this equation can consequently be used to evolve @xmath54 there .    for the function",
    "@xmath58 the situation is somewhat different .",
    "first we notice that we can derive an equation similar to ( [ hsurf ] ) also for @xmath58 ( _ i.e. _ an equation with no second derivative with respect to @xmath94 ) .",
    "this equation is @xmath95 at @xmath78 . using this equation , and the already established continuity of @xmath88",
    ", we can infer that @xmath96 thus , @xmath97 is continuous across the surface of the star .",
    "finally , it follows from the wave equation ( [ gwave ] ) that @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the constant and index in the polytropic equation of state , respectively .",
    "thus we see that in the case that we consider ( @xmath19 ) the right hand side of ( [ 2der ] ) approaches a constant as @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , the second derivative of @xmath58 will be discontinuous across the surface of the star .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the equations that govern perturbations of a relativistic star . we now want to evolve these equations from a given set of initial data .",
    "the ultimate purpose of this exercise is to use the perturbation approach to infer what one should expect in a problem of physical interest , e.g. when two neutron stars coalesce . at the present time",
    "such discussions are beyond our means . before trying to implement astrophysically relevant initial data",
    "we must ensure that we can evolve the stellar perturbation equations accurately .",
    "hence we have tested our evolution code by experimenting with different kinds of initial data .",
    "this enables us to conclude that our numerical implementation of the various equations is reliable .",
    "we have also gained some insight into the excitation of the stellar pulsation modes .",
    "to define acceptable initial data for the evolution problem is not a trivial task . to specify astrophysically relevant initial data one should first solve the fully nonlinear 3-dimensional initial - value problem for ( say ) a newly formed neutron star that settles down after core collapse .",
    "then the results must be translated into a form that makes them useful as initial data for the perturbation equations .",
    "although easy to describe in words , each step is difficult and requires great care ( cf .",
    "the analogous problem of two colliding black holes @xcite ) . in short ,",
    "a detailed formulation of initial data for the perturbation equations requires much further work , and we will return to it in the future . here",
    "we will focus on the evolution of the perturbation equations from initial data that seems logical .",
    "a careful analysis of the constraints that our initial data must satisfy indicates that we are free to choose our evolved variables @xmath101 such that the hamiltonian constraint and its first derivative are satisfied ( of course all boundary conditions and physical constraints must also be satisfied ) @xcite . as an initial simplification",
    "we consider only time - symmetric initial data ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this assumption leads to rather contrived initial data from a physical point of view . basically , the waveforms that we see as outgoing at future null infinity were initially incoming at past null infinity",
    "nevertheless , time - symmetric initial data provide a useful starting point for studies of the evolution problem .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the time derivative of the hamiltonian constraint @xmath103 is automatically satisfied for time - symmetric data .",
    "the choice of @xmath101 to satisfy @xmath104 on the initial hypersurface depends on the model problem under consideration .",
    "so far we have considered two different classes of data sets .",
    "the first involves no initial fluid perturbation in the star , while the second includes a nonzero fluid perturbation .    the first initial data set corresponds to the scattering of an incoming gravitational wave packet by the star .",
    "here the fluid variable @xmath53 is set to zero , and the metric variables initially have support only in the exterior vacuum . to enable comparison with the axial problem considered by andersson and kokkotas @xcite",
    "we specify the zerilli function , @xmath67 to be a narrow gaussian centered at a large radius .",
    "the spacetime variable @xmath58 can then be calculated using @xmath105 this equation follows when the definition ( [ zdef ] ) of the zerilli function is combined with the constraint equation ( [ hamilton ] ) . finally , we specify the remaining function @xmath54 by numerically integrating the constraint equation @xmath104 .",
    "an example of such initial data is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the scattering of gravitational waves is , however , not the generic problem that we are interested in .",
    "generically , one would expect a non - vanishing perturbation inside the star .",
    "thus , we would like to consider various perturbations in the stellar fluid .",
    "that is , we specify @xmath53 ( arbitrarily ) at some initial time . from the hamiltonian constraint it is clearly seen that such a fluid perturbation must be accompanied by a non - vanishing metric perturbation .",
    "thus , we should formally find @xmath54 and @xmath58 in such a way that the constraint equation ( [ hamilton ] ) is satisfied inside the star .",
    "there is no a priori method of calculating @xmath54 and @xmath58 uniquely , since we seemingly have the freedom to choose either of these two functions . to test our numerical code",
    ", we have therefore made calculations for three different kinds of initial data :    1 .",
    "we combine the specified function @xmath53 with @xmath106 .",
    "this is convenient since we then only need to integrate a first order differential equation ( [ hamilton ] ) to determine the corresponding @xmath54 .",
    "an alternative to this is inspired by the weak - field limit .",
    "it is known that ( in the standard regge - wheeler notation ) @xmath107 as the star becomes more newtonian @xcite .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath108 .",
    "once we have made this assumption we can numerically integrate the second order differential equation ( [ hamilton ] ) and find an acceptable @xmath58 .",
    "the third set of initial data is also based on the weak field result .",
    "we set @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the perturbation in the newtonian potential .",
    "then @xmath110 satisfies @xcite @xmath111 then the appropriate function @xmath54 is obtained by integrating ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "an example of this kind of initial data , for @xmath112 is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "even though the initial data for the model scenarios that we have chosen ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) are rather different , the gravitational waves that emerge from the system during each evolution are qualitatively quite similar .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the gravitational waves that follow when a gaussian in the zerilli function is scattered off the star .",
    "the corresponding initial data is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we use the gauge invariant quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "( [ ginvar ] ) ) to represent the gravitational waves that reach a distant observer . in this specific example",
    ", the observer is located at @xmath113 . after a sudden burst of waves follows a ringdown corresponding to the quasinormal modes of the star .",
    "the ringdown consists of two parts .",
    "the first part ( from @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) shows the high frequencies and the rapid damping that are characteristics of the gravitational - wave modes .",
    "the second part of the signal ( for @xmath115 ) is slowly damped , and the oscillations have longer wavelength .",
    "this part of the signal should correspond to the fluid pulsation modes .",
    "a spectral analysis of the signal shows that the emerging waves are composed of the @xmath0-mode , the first @xmath1-mode and the slowest damped @xmath2-mode for the star , cf .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the result is similar in the case when the stellar fluid is perturbed initially .",
    "an example of such an evolution is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this example corresponds to the initial data ( [ finit ] ) , cf . figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "again , the post - burst signal can be roughly decomposed into two parts : the first part ( @xmath116 ) corresponds to the @xmath2-modes and the later signal ( @xmath117 ) is due to the fluid modes .",
    "the corresponding spectrum shows the presence of the @xmath0-mode , the first @xmath1-mode and the slowest damped @xmath2-mode , cf .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "these two examples show that one should expect both fluid and gravitational pulsation modes to be excited in a generic situation .",
    "but it is also clear that the relative amplitudes of the various modes depend on the initial data . in the case of a gravitational - wave pulse impinging on the star",
    "( figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) more energy is released through the @xmath2-modes than in the case of an initially perturbed fluid ( figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is not very surprising , since in the first case the impinging waves must excite motion in the fluid , which then leads to gravitational waves with ( say ) @xmath0-mode characteristics . in the second case the fluid",
    "is already perturbed so one would expect a more pronounced excitation of the fluid modes .",
    "our results indicate that there can be situations where a considerably amount of energy is released through the @xmath2-modes .",
    "interestingly , we find that the three ad hoc ways to specify initial data with an initial fluid perturbation ( see the previous section ) lead to different predictions for the energy released through @xmath2-modes .",
    "basically , we find that the excitation of the @xmath2-modes increases with the initial value of @xmath54 .",
    "that is , if we set @xmath108 the evolutions only show a glimmer of @xmath2-mode oscillations .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2-modes dominate the signal in cases where @xmath106 initially .",
    "the answer to the question whether the @xmath2-modes will be excited to a detectable level in an astrophysically relevant situation requires a more detailed study .",
    "but it is now clear that an affirmative answer requires a considerable initial energy in the spacetime function @xmath54 .      since we have found that several of the stars pulsation modes are excited in a general scenario , it is wortwhile to compare our results to previous numerical neutron star simulations .",
    "the available simulations fall into two categories : simulations of coalescing stars and studies of rotating core collapse .",
    "almost uniquely , studies of coalescing neutron stars use newtonian hydrodynamics and extract the gravitational waves via the quadrupole formula . as already mentioned above , this approach can not account for the @xmath2-modes , but should be able to reveal the presence of the fluid pulsation modes  provided that these are excited to a significant level .",
    "a survey of the literature reveals several indications that the pulsation modes are present in the gravitational wave signals from coalescing stars .",
    "waveforms obtained by nakamura and oohara @xcite show clear mode presence ( cf . figs .",
    "5,8 and 11 in @xcite ) .",
    "their figure 5 is actually very similar to our figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "ruffert et al .",
    "@xcite have also obtained gravitational wave signals from coalescing stars that show late - time oscillations .",
    "their waveforms and spectra ( cf .",
    "fig 24 and 27 in @xcite ) show oscillations at frequencies between 1.5 - 2 khz .",
    "another interesting piece of evidence can be found in the results of zhuge et al .",
    "@xcite . they model coalescing polytropic stars using sph . in their waveforms ( cf .",
    "fig . 6 in @xcite ) one can possibly see oscillations in the late - time waveforms , but these oscillations are tiny .",
    "however , all the calculated spectra show a clear peak beyond the cut - off frequency that is associated with the actual coalescence ( cf .",
    "12 in @xcite ) .",
    "the authors attribute this peak to  transient oscillations induced in the coalescing stars during the merger process  the result of low - order @xmath1-modes with frequencies somewhat higher than the kepler frequency in the merging object \" .",
    "the situation is similar as far as rotating core collapse is concerned .",
    "most available studies use newtonian hydrodynamics and account for gravitational - wave emission through the quadrupole formula .",
    "the collapse of a nonrotating star is expected to bounce at nuclear densities , but if the star is rotating the collapse can also bounce at subnuclear densities because of the centrifugal force . in each case , the emerging gravitational waves are dominated by a burst associated with the bounce .",
    "but the waves that follow a centrifugal bounce can also show large amplitude oscillations that may be associated with pulsations in the collapsed core .",
    "such results have been obtained by mnchmeyer et al .",
    "some of their models show the presence of modes with different angular dependence superimposed ( see fig . 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "typically these oscillations have a period of a few ms and damp out in 20ms .",
    "the calculations also show that the energy in the higher multipoles is roughly three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the quadrupole .",
    "more recent simulations by yamada and sato @xcite and zwerger and mller @xcite also show post - bounce oscillations ( cf .",
    "waveforms in figs .",
    "24 of @xcite and figs . 5 and 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "there is thus evidence that the fluid pulsation modes of a star will be excited in both the collapse and the coalescence scenario @xcite . from our present results",
    "it would then seem likely that the @xmath2-modes will also be excited . but to show that this is the case one must incorporate general relativity in the simulations of collapse and coalescence .",
    "as yet there has been few attempts to do this , but an interesting example is provided by the core - collapse studies of seidel et al . @xcite .",
    "the approach adopted in those papers is , in fact , quite similar to our present one : one considers axial ( odd parity ) or polar ( even parity ) perturbations of a time - dependent background ( that evolves according to a specified collapse scenario ) .",
    "as expected from the newtonian studies , the extracted gravitational waves are dominated by a sharp burst associated with the bounce at nuclear densities .",
    "but there are also features that may be related to the @xmath2-modes . in a case designed to collapse and rebound with extreme energy seidel et al .",
    "find a ringing mode in the post - bounce gravitational waves ( cf .",
    "figure 7b of @xcite ) . since there are no axial fluid modes for a nonrotating star , it is plausible that this mode corresponds to one of the axial @xmath2-modes of the core . furthermore , the power spectrum for one of the simulations discussed in @xcite ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "2 ) shows some enhancement around 7 khz .",
    "as the authors state , this `` is probably a result of some numerical noise ... rather than a true physical effect '' , but it is interesting to note that the slowest damped axial @xmath2-mode has a pulsation frequency of roughly this magnitude .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the evolution problem for the equations that govern a linear perturbation of a relativistic star .",
    "we have taken the first steps towards developing a framework within which one can study the behaviour of a neutron star at the late stages after a gravitational collapse or a binary coalescence .",
    "such a framework would provide a powerful testbed for fully relativistic simulations .",
    "furthermore , we can hope to learn much physics from the present approach .",
    "the results we have presented indicate that the gravitational waves that are generated by a perturbed neutron star will carry the signature of both the gravitational - wave modes and the fluid pulsation modes .",
    "this is a significant result because it indicates that present estimates of the gravitational - wave emission ( that are mainly based on newtonian calculations and the quadrupole formula ) may be flawed .",
    "such studies would never yield the @xmath2-mode part of the signal , so the energy that is released through these modes would not be accounted for .    however , to show that the @xmath2-modes are astrophysically relevant ( here we have only provided evidence that they can carry a considerable energy in certain model situations ) we must consider the question of initial data more carefully .",
    "this can be done either by extending our equations to the case of gravitational collapse ( allowing the background to be time dependent ) , or by incorporating a @xmath118constant data set from a fully relativistic 3d collapse .",
    "after extracting the perturbations one can then evolve them on a static background .",
    "we will return to this problem in the near future .",
    "finally , the present results show that it is meaningful to discuss whether one can extract information about the parameters of the star from observed mode - signals . specifically , since both the @xmath0-mode and the slowest damped @xmath2-mode are present in the signals in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] one could use the scheme that was suggested by andersson and kokkotas @xcite to infer ( or at least constrain ) the mass and the radius of the star .",

    "na and kdk also thank the albert - einstein institute in potsdam for generous hospitality .",
    "we discretized the evolution equations ( [ swave ] ) , ( [ gwave ] ) and ( [ hwave ] ) in a standard way , using second order centered finite differencing , on a regular grid .",
    "the grid is equally spaced in the time coordinate @xmath119 and the spatial coordinate @xmath94 . since the coefficients in the equations are functions of the schwarzschild radius @xmath8 , we have to solve equation ( [ tort ] ) numerically .",
    "some of the coefficients in the evolution equations diverge at the origin , and the finite difference equations can not be used close to @xmath76 . however , as discussed in section iid the dynamical variables all approach zero as @xmath120 , and in practice it was sufficient to use the leading order behaviour ( [ centre ] ) close to the origin .",
    "the boundary equations ( [ hsurf ] ) and ( [ gsurf ] ) were used to evolve the functions @xmath53 and @xmath58 at the stellar boundary , and @xmath54 was evolved using the evolution equation ( [ swave ] ) .",
    "a standard outgoing wave boundary condition was implemented for @xmath54 and @xmath58 at the outer boundary of the grid .",
    "this causes some reflection from the boundary , since in both cases the potential in the wave equation is small , but not zero .",
    "these reflections were too small to be `` seen '' in the numerical data , but to be safe the outer boundary was placed sufficiently far away that it could have no influence on the results .    to construct initial data the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamilton ] ) must be solved . for the cases we considered this reduced to solving either a first order ode for @xmath54 ( when @xmath58 and @xmath53 were given ) or a second order ode for @xmath58 ( when @xmath54 and @xmath53 were given ) .",
    "the first order ode was solved using a fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite , and the second order ode was solved using a relaxation method . a potential problem with finding the solution at the stellar boundary ( where the second space derivative of @xmath58 can be discontinuous if @xmath121 , see section iid )",
    "was avoided by only using initial data with @xmath122 at the boundary .    analytically , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath104 is satisfied throughout the evolution if it is satisfied initially .",
    "numerically , there will always be some errors , and we can calculate @xmath123 in the discrete @xmath124 norm over the grid on each @xmath118constant slice and plot the result as a function of time . calculating this error using different grid resolutions for a particular model",
    "allows the convergence of the code to be tested .",
