    "a conceptually simple phenomenon , freezing of liquid into glass , has turned out to be one of the most difficult problems in condensed matter physics , the problem of glass transition @xcite . analyzing the current state of the field ,",
    "dyre recently suggested that glass transition itself is not a big mystery : it universally occurs in any liquid when its relaxation time @xmath7 exceeds the time of experiment at the glass transition temperature @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the challenges lie above @xmath8 .",
    "if we consider the changes in dynamics in a liquid on lowering the temperature , we find two dynamic crossovers .",
    "the first crossover is at high temperature at liquid relaxation time @xmath9 ps , at which dynamics changes from exponential debye relaxation to stretched exponential relaxation , ser , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a relaxing quantity and 0@xmath121 .",
    "this crossover is universal , i.e. is seen in many systems @xcite . as the temperature is lowered , we find another universal crossover at @xmath13@xmath1 s @xcite .",
    "this crossover also marks the qualitative change in system s dynamics @xcite , and was attributed to the transition from the `` liquid - like '' to the `` solid - like '' behaviour @xcite .",
    "note that although relaxation time at the second crossover is much larger as compared to the first one , it is still about 9 - 10 orders magnitude smaller that relaxation time at the glass transition ( @xmath14 s ) .",
    "one hopes to find useful insights into the problem of glass transition if the origin of the two dynamic crossovers could be rationalized .",
    "a glass is different from a liquid by virtue of its ability to support shear stress .",
    "this suggests that a theory of glass transition should discuss how this ability changes on lowering the temperature , yet such a discussion is absent from popular glass transition theories , including free volume and entropy theories @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears that the most important physical process in glass transition , stress relaxation mechanism of a liquid , has not been discussed , and is not understood despite many decades of research .    in this paper ,",
    "our approach to the problem of glass transition is essentially based on the ability of a liquid to support shear stress on lowering the temperature .",
    "we introduce temperature - dependent liquid elasticity length , which is the range of elastic interaction in a liquid .",
    "several angstroms at high temperature , this length grows with relaxation time of the system , increasing sharply on lowering the temperature .",
    "we propose that that the first and second crossovers take place when this length becomes equal to the values of the medium - range order and system size , respectively . in this picture , we discuss how the second dynamic crossover is related to the old question of whether glass transition is a thermodynamic or kinetic phenomenon . finally , we perform the experimental measurement of viscosity at different values of liquid elasticity length to test the prediction of our theory that viscosity increases with the size of the macroscopic system .",
    "in this section , we introduce the important concept of liquid elasticity length and discuss how it compares with characteristic lengths in a disordered system . lets consider relaxation in a liquid under , for example , shear stress .",
    "such a relaxation is the sequence of elementary localized shear structural rearrangements , local relaxation events ( lres ) @xcite .",
    "a typical shear relaxation event is shown in figure 1 ( term `` concordant '' in the figure caption is not important here , and will be explained in the next section ) .",
    "the accompanied structural rearrangement produces elastic shear stress that can propagate through the system .",
    "the important question is how does this stress affect relaxation of other lres in the system ?    lets consider how lres interact elastically , namely how the changes of stresses due to remote lres affect a given local relaxing region , shown in the centre in figure 2 .",
    "a remote shear lre , creates the elastic shear waves of different frequencies . among these frequencies ,",
    "the high - frequency wave are present , because the deformation , associated with a lre , creates a wave with a length comparable to interatomic separation ( see figure 1 ) , and hence with a frequency on the order of debye frequency . at high frequency ,",
    "larger than the inverse of @xmath7 , a liquid can support shear stress just like a solid .",
    "hence the high - frequency shear waves from all remote lres propagate the stress and its variations to the central region . however , not all of these contribute to the increase of stress on the central relaxing region , but only those that are located with the distance @xmath15 from the central lre , where @xmath16 is the speed of sound .",
    "this is because the stresses that arrive to the centre from larger distances take time longer than @xmath7 to travel , during which the central lre already relaxes ( the time between consecutive lres is given by @xmath7 ) .",
    "after time @xmath7 a new lre happens in its place or nearby , and the process repeats .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 defines the maximal distance at which two given lres elastically interact , and can be called _ liquid elasticity length_. because @xmath16 is on the order of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the interatomic separation of about 1   and @xmath19 the oscillation period , or inverse of debye frequency ( @xmath20 ps ) , we find    @xmath21    to illustrate the actual values of the introduced elasticity length in real liquids at room temperature , we have calculated @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) using the experimental values of viscosity @xmath22 and maxwell relation @xmath23 , assuming @xmath24 10 gpa and @xmath25 m / sec .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 . starting from 11000   in familiar liquids like water or olive oil , @xmath2 increases to 0.01 mm in honey and to 1 mm in very viscous tar . in extremely viscous pitch",
    ", @xmath26 m. an interesting observation here is that for most familiar liquids , @xmath2 does not exceed their typical experimental sizes .",
    "the subject of system size will be discussed in this section as well as throughout this paper .",
    ".approximate values of viscosity @xmath22 , relaxation time @xmath7 and liquid elasticity length @xmath2 at room temperature .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     consistent with the theoretical prediction , we find that for @xmath27 , @xmath28 . on the other hand , for @xmath29",
    ", we observe that @xmath30 : for @xmath2=110 mm , the viscosity is about 40% larger in the larger container as compared to the smaller one .",
    "the observed increase of viscosity with system size is an interesting unexpected effect .",
    "since no other theory predicts that viscosity should increase with system size , we believe that this specific result lends good support to the elastic picture of glass transition that we discussed .",
    "in summary , we have introduced the concept of liquid elasticity length @xmath2 , and discussed that when @xmath2 becomes equal to the medium - range length and system size on lowering the temperature , two universal dynamic crossovers take place .",
    "the discussion of the second dynamic crossover is directly related to the old debate between the proponents of `` kinetic '' and `` thermodynamic '' views of the glass transition , and we have discussed that glass transition is a kinetic process for any finite system , and is a thermodynamic transition for the infinite system . finally , we have experimentally tested the prediction of our theory that apparent viscosity increases with the size of a macroscopic system ."
