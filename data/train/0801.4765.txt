    "transverse relaxation of the nmr or esr signal acquires distinctive features @xcite when it occurs in a medium which possesses magnetic structure on a _",
    "mesoscopic scale_. this scale is intermediate between the microscopic atomic or molecular scale , and the macroscopic sample size or the resolution achievable with time - resolved faraday rotation measurement @xcite , magnetic resonance imaging @xcite ( mri ) , or esr imaging @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the transverse relaxation in a broad class of media where the mesoscopic structure can be characterized by variable larmor frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the problem of mesoscopic contribution to transverse relaxation arises in a broad variety of contexts , ranging from solid state physics to radiology . in the semiconductor spintronics , the spatially dependent larmor frequency @xmath0 for electrons or holes can be induced either via ferromagnetic imprinting , or electrostatically by locally varying the electron @xmath1-factor @xcite . for nuclear or electron spins in liquids , the spatially dependent larmor frequency can arise due to heterogeneous magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the latter property is crucial in the field of biomedical mri , where the heterogeneous susceptibility @xmath2 is inherent to majority of living tissues due to paramagnetism of deoxygenated haemoglobin in red blood cells @xcite , enabling _ in vivo _ visualization of regional activations in human brain via functional mri @xcite .",
    "moreover , the susceptibility contrast can be enhanced by doping blood with magnetic contrast agents for clinical purposes , e.g. for diagnostics of acute stroke .",
    "the common property of all these systems is the presence of the transverse relaxation that occurs via the dispersion of precession phases of spins accumulated during their diffusive motion .",
    "this reduces the vector sum of magnetic moments from all spins in the sample and causes attenuation ( termed _ dephasing _ ) of the measured signal time course @xmath3 .",
    "the signal @xmath3 is typically a sum over a large number of spins acquired over a macroscopic volume @xmath4 whose size greatly exceeds the diffusion length @xmath5 .",
    "the randomness of the brownian trajectories results in an effective averaging ( diffusion narrowing ) of the contributions from different parts of the volume @xmath4 that are separated by less than @xmath6 .",
    "further averaging occurs between larger domains of size exceeding @xmath6 .",
    "this self - averaging character of the measurement is a major obstacle in quantifying the properties of the medium on the scales below @xmath4 .",
    "here we study how the geometric structural details of @xmath0 on the mesoscopic scale are reflected in the measured signal , i.e. survive the above averaging .",
    "for definitiveness , we will use the established nmr terminology , since generalizations onto the esr case present no problem .",
    "theory of mesoscopic relaxation in the presence of the diffusion narrowing has been previously addressed in the mri context @xcite .",
    "these works , however , either do not directly relate relaxation to the structure @xcite , or employ strong simplifying assumptions ( representing the medium as a dilute suspension of mesoscopic objects with small volume fraction @xmath7 @xcite and a particular shape @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the virial expansion for the signal @xmath8 , where @xmath9 describes the dephasing due to a single object .",
    "the mesoscopic field heterogeneity is accounted for perturbatively , which yields relaxation @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the known results in the diffusion - narrowing regime are limited to dilute suspensions of effectively weakly magnetized objects .",
    "examples are dilute blood samples , or tissues with small volume fraction of paramagnetic vessels , in the fields @xmath11 t .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a framework for the transverse relaxation from arbitrary magnetic media beyond the limitations of dilute suspension and the weak magnetization .",
    "first , we suggest a universal description of the spectral lineshape @xmath12 of the signal : [ s - omega ] s ( ) = 1-i- ( ) , where function @xmath13 is a measurable characteristic of the medium . the quantity @xmath14 can be loosely interpreted as a dispersive relaxation rate , with eq .",
    "( [ s - omega ] ) being a generalization of the conventional lorentzian line shape to the case of heterogeneous magnetic medium .",
    "technically , the representation ( [ s - omega ] ) originates from the standard form of single particle green s function in many - body physics , with @xmath13 called the _ self - energy _",
    "part @xcite , the term we will use here .",
    "the immediate advantage of using @xmath13 instead of the traditional lineshape @xmath12 is that the frequency - dependent part of the self - energy is entirely determined by the mesoscopic magnetic structure and thus vanishes for homogeneous media .",
    "in contrast , the effect of mesoscopic structure on the lineshape @xmath12 is a complicated deformation of a lorentzian , that is difficult to quantify @xcite .",
    "further we relate the self - energy to the geometric structure on the mesoscopic scale for media fully permeable for spin carriers , and verify the results using _ ab intio _ simulations of the transverse relaxation .",
    "finally , we apply our general results to quantify the line shape of water proton resonance in blood @xcite in terms of mesoscopic structural parameters .",
    "here we consider the nmr signal from a _ random medium _ which is characterized by the correlation functions @xmath15 .",
    "these functions vary on the mesoscopic scale much smaller than the size of the acquisition volume @xmath4 .",
    "the self - averaging character of the measurement implies that one needs to find the signal from a particular realization of @xmath0 , and then to average over the realizations according to the distribution moments @xmath16 . in what follows ,",
    "we suppose for simplicity that the medium is isotropic and translation - invariant in a statistical sense .",
    "these assumptions cover a wide variety of applications , such as the transverse relaxation in blood , or in the brain gray matter .",
