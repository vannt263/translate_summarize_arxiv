    "glassiness of localized electron systems was predicted long ago @xcite .",
    "experimentally , such behaviour was first found in the slow capacitance relaxation of uncompensated semiconductors  @xcite , and more recently in a series of experiments on strongly disordered indium - oxide films  @xcite , as well as in granular metallic films @xcite where slow logarithmic relaxation , aging and memory were observed in the gate - controlled conductivity .",
    "the memory of equilibration conditions is manifested as an anomalous ( symmetric ) field effect .",
    "the conductivity of the sample always increases no matter whether the carrier density is increased or decreased .",
    "this out - of - equilibrium dip in the conductivity is remarkably universal , its shape being independent of disorder and magnetic field , while its width ( in the applied gate voltage ) shrinks with decreasing temperature and increases with carrier density  @xcite .",
    "the latter fact demonstrates the importance of electron - electron interactions , suggesting that these systems constitute genuine electron glasses .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a phenomenological theory to account for these features .",
    "the theory is based on the standard model of anderson insulators ( in 2d ) with strongly localized , classical electrons  @xcite @xmath0 the impurity sites being located on a square lattice with nearest neighbour distance @xmath1 .",
    "disorder and frustration are introduced by random site energies @xmath2 , independently and uniformly distributed over the range @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a homogeneously distributed background charge , adjustable by the gate .",
    "three key ingredients are essential in order to understand the memory effect :    _ i ) _ below a critical temperature ( @xmath5 ) the electron glass falls out of equilibrium on experimental time scales due to the appearance of a large number of metastable states which are separated by high barriers . after a sudden change of external parameters the system is unable to relax rapidly to its new ground state , and",
    "may retain a memory of its former state . this scenario is suggested by numerical simulations  @xcite , as well as by mean field theory  @xcite which predicts a glass transition at @xmath6 for large disorder @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "_ ii ) _ the repulsive interactions induce a coulomb gap in the local density of states , which tends to the linear efros - shklovskii pseudogap at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the gap varies slightly from state to state and can serve as a fingerprint of the sample history .    _",
    "iii ) _ the system conducts via variable range hopping which is exponentially sensitive to perturbations of the local density of states .    the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite makes the key assumption that the precise form of the coulomb gap varies between different metastable states , and may thus reflect the pathway which a given state was obtained .",
    "this situation can occur when a small gate voltage is applied after a long equilibration . in the first place",
    ", the gate introduces additional background charges ( changing @xmath8 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ) , forcing the same amount of charge to enter the system in order to compensate on average for the gate field .",
    "the new carriers occupy the empty states just above the fermi level , @xmath9 , shifting the fermi level up with respect to the bulk of the occupied states .",
    "the resulting density of states is asymmetric around the new fermi level .",
    "we argue below that this feature survives the fast relaxations triggered by the presence of the new particles . due to the asymmetry",
    ", thermal excitations of electrons into empty states will be enhanced , and the hopping conductivity will thus increase .",
    "a quantitative analysis shows that this effect dominates over the decrease due to the suppression of hole excitations  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of new carriers renders other particles unstable and induces spontaneous hops that decrease the total energy .",
    "the question arises whether , or to what extent , such fast relaxation processes can wipe out the initial asymmetry of the density of states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argued that as long as the density of new carriers , @xmath10 , is smaller than that of thermally excited electrons , @xmath11 , the gate voltage effect is perturbative .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the requirement that the shift of the fermi level ( with respect to the bulk of the states ) be smaller than temperature .",
    "below , we will provide more detailed arguments to justify the neglect of fast relaxations in this regime . on the other hand , at higher gate voltages",
    "new carriers are introduced on sites that were essentially always empty in the original state . since in general their local environment is not favorable to the addition of a particle , the new electrons likely trigger relaxation processes and destabilize the original state .",
    "such reconfigurations will lead to the saturation of the anomalous field effect at voltages where @xmath12 .",
    "let us analyse the stability criterion @xmath13 in more detail in the case of low temperatures where the equilibrium density of states , @xmath14 , displays a linear coulomb gap .",
    "more precisely , we assume the scaling form @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "if the density of injected particles , @xmath10 , is larger than @xmath19 , their mutual interaction exceeds the temperature , so that they spontaneously rearrange , reshuffling the distribution of levels . on the other hand , for @xmath13",
    ", the interactions between new particles can be neglected .",
    "the particles will a priori occupy the first empty states above @xmath9 , shifting the fermi level by @xmath20 , so that the new density initially takes the form @xmath21 . however , the coulomb repulsion from the new electrons shifts the local energies of other sites , inducing spontaneous hops that affect the distribution of levels .",
    "let us estimate the density @xmath22 of recombining electron - hole pairs that affect the number of states in the interval @xmath23 .",
    "we count the pairs ( @xmath24 ) whose recombination energy , @xmath25 , is raised above temperature , while the pair was stable ( @xmath26 ) before the introduction of new particles .",
    "we approximate @xmath22 by the density of states for pairs with @xmath27 of order @xmath28 , multiplied by the typical shift of @xmath27 for a pair of sites with distance @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is of order @xmath30 for the dominant short pairs with @xmath31 . assuming the single - site energies to be independent , we find @xmath32 this",
    "should be compared to the change @xmath33 in the density of particle / hole states in the same energy interval @xmath34 , caused by the shift of @xmath9 : @xmath35 . performing the integration over @xmath36 in ( [ unstable ] ) , and dividing by @xmath37",
    ", we obtain @xmath38 which is only a small fraction in the range of energies ( @xmath39 ) that are probed in hopping conductivity .",
    "note , however , that within the range @xmath40 the density of states can be appreciably modified by fast relaxations .",
    "in order to provide evidence that history dependence can be seen in the density of states , we carried out simulations at @xmath41 for the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with moderate disorder strength @xmath42 in systems of linear size @xmath43 .",
    "starting from random initial conditions , we allowed all hops that decrease the energy , until we reached a state that is stable to any single hop .",
    "we then filled in a fraction @xmath44 of new particles , putting them onto the available sites with least energy cost .",
    "finally , we simulated the fast relaxation processes by steepest descent via single hops to the closest metastable state . for both metastable states we determine the fermi level @xmath9 ( the energy separating occupied and empty levels ) and calculate the distribution of local energies , @xmath45 . for the states obtained before particle injection ,",
    "@xmath9 is found to increase linearly with filling fraction , @xmath46 , as one expects for a system with finite ( `` field cooled '' ) compressibility .",
    "however , in the states obtained after injection and relaxation , the average fermi level is systematically higher than that of unbiased states with the same filling fraction .",
    "this is also manifested by the fact that the bulk of the density of states , @xmath47 , is shifted down by @xmath48 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] . the extra shift @xmath48 increases with filling fraction as @xmath49 , as one expects from the presence of a linear coulomb gap .",
    "this result reflects the incompressibility of the coulomb glass  @xcite , @xmath50 ( for small @xmath51 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in the pinned wigner crystal  @xcite . at larger @xmath51 ,",
    "the shift saturates to @xmath52 , as the system becomes unstable and reorganizes significantly .",
    "at finite , but small temperature the numerical results for @xmath41 should remain robust , since the density of states can only relax further by activated processes . the fact that at @xmath41 the shift @xmath48 saturates only at a finite fraction @xmath51 suggests that the saturation condition @xmath53 for the anomalous field effect only applies for @xmath54 .",
    "however , at least in the presence of strong disorder , @xmath55 , one expects a rather large temperature interval @xmath56 in which the width of the anomalous field effect is correctly described by @xmath53 .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided quantitative arguments and numerical evidence at @xmath41 that the local density of states can exhibit memory of the sample history .",
    "these independent approaches provide further support for the memory scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .                        in low spatial dimensions ( below the upper critical dimension )",
    "it is possible that there is no genuine thermodynamic transition . in this case",
    ", the mean field value for @xmath57 should be taken as an estimate of the temperature below which the dynamics is strongly activated ."
