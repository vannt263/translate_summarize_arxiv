    "interest in deep water ambient noise has its origins in the 1930s , beginning with attempts to explain microseisms , persistent and ubiquitous low frequency ground oscillations .",
    "their spectrum peaks near 0.17 hz , roughly twice the characteristic frequency of ocean swell , and the amplitude correlates with storminess .",
    "the most viable explanation for this phenomena , based on the work of miche , @xcite was originally proposed by longuet - higgins @xcite and extended by hasselmann @xcite and brekhovskikh .",
    "@xcite the cause is the non - linear interaction of two oppositely traveling surface waves .",
    "individually , the pressure attenuates exponentially with depth .",
    "however , wave pairs with nearly opposed wave vectors collide to excite an acoustic wave at approximately twice the frequency which propagates downward with negligible attenuation . a review of the wave - wave mechanism and its seismic effects , together with citations to much of the relevant literature ,",
    "can be found in kibblewhite and wu .",
    "@xcite    here we give a unified exposition of the acoustic field radiated by non - linear surface wave interactions .",
    "the power spectral density matrix ( psdm ) , obtained from autocorrelations and cross - correlations of pressure and vector velocity , is found both for an ocean of infinite depth , and an ocean layer over an elastic half - space .",
    "it is shown that the ratios of elements of the psdm for deep observations of the acoustic signal are nearly invariant , depending on frequency and the propagation environment but not on the details of the wave spectrum .",
    "while the wave spectrum displays dramatic daily variability that correlates with wind speed , the propagation environment is essentially constant , aside from sound speed variations due to seasonal fluctuations or internal waves .",
    "the variability of the wave spectrum manifests itself in fluctuations in the amplitude of individual psdm elements , but not in their ratios .",
    "the standing wave approximation is based on the fact that the sound speed is much greater than the phase velocity of surface gravity or capillary waves .",
    "consequently , only pairs of surface waves with almost exactly equal frequency and almost exactly opposing propagation directions ( hence almost a standing wave ) can generate a non - evanescent acoustic wave , propagating without vertical attenuation ( neglecting viscosity ) . for acoustic waves which generate microseisms , the constraint is even more stringent ; not only must the acoustic wave propagate without vertical attenuation , it must propagate nearly vertically such that the horizontal component of the acoustic wave - number is sufficiently small to excite microseisms , which have characteristic wave - length @xmath0 km .    it is shown that the standing wave approximation implies that the ratios of elements of the psdm are universal constants .",
    "in fact , this is far too strong a result , and we do not expect its consequences to be observed , except perhaps for sufficiently lossy or rough bottoms and higher wave frequencies . because bottom effects negate the standing wave approximation , the radiated acoustic signal becomes sensitive to very slight deviations from the standing wave configuration .",
    "we show that a weaker form of the standing wave approximation will hold since the acoustic source term , unlike the acoustic propagation term , is not particularly sensitive to variations of the horizontal wave vector @xmath1 , the sum of surface wave vectors , in the region for which the acoustic wave propagates without vertical attenuation , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the acoustic frequency and @xmath4 is the sound speed ) . while ratios of psdm elements are not universal constants in the `` weak standing wave approximation , '' they will display little variability with changing surface conditions , depending only on frequency and the propagation environment but not on the details of the surface wave spectrum .",
    "the theory is verified with data from the hydrophone and a pair of three - component seismometers of the observatory ( h2o ) , located at 5000 m depth near 28n , 142w .",
    "@xcite spectra and cross - spectra for all three - hour windows in a 50-day interval of year 2000 have been computed .",
    "surface winds , according to the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) , ranged between approximately 2 and 10 @xmath5 during the period , and the significant wave height between 1.3 and 2.7 m. there is , indeed , little variation in the ratios of the psdm elements compared with the variations in the individual matrix elements ; the separation between spectra , in db , is essentially constant .",
    "the best evidence is from coherency between pressure and vertical velocity , which is especially high for frequencies less than 1 hz . the diminution above 1 hz is attributed to bottom effects not embraced by the simple model .",
    "starting with longuet - higgins , @xcite the most common derivation of the acoustic signal radiated by wave - wave interactions involves a perturbative solution of the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the expansion parameter characterizing the non - linearity is proportional to wave slope .",
    "the leading term is a superposition of plane surface gravity waves and the second - order term is an acoustic plane wave .",
    "we give an immensely abbreviated review of this approach , closely following kibblewhite and wu , @xcite but extending the analysis with a unified treatment both of pressure and vector velocity and simplifying it by considering the bottom as an elastic half - space .",
    "farrell and munk ( ref .  , appendix a ) give a brief review and rationalization of the numerous solutions obtained since longuet - higgins .",
    "the relevant perturbative solution of the irrotational hydrodynamic equations is expressed in terms of a velocity potential @xmath6 and a surface displacement @xmath7 . the potential and displacement are expanded as    @xmath8",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath9 may be set to 1 at the end of the calculation .",
    "the first - order solution is taken to be an incompressible flow corresponding to a superposition of surface plane waves ;    @xmath10    where @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the dispersion relation is @xmath14 with surface tension @xmath15 .",

    "wave spectra are essentially constant over such small variations of angle and wave - length , which are too small to resolve experimentally .",
    "thus , at sufficient depth , the integral over the horizontal wave number @xmath1 in ( [ melements ] - [ lastmelements ] ) can be restricted to @xmath64 , and the source term @xmath65 can be replaced with its value at @xmath66 . in the absence of a bottom",

    "this is known as the standing wave approximation . in light of the above discussion",
    ", the standing wave approximation is a very good approximation in the absence of a bottom , or for a perfectly absorbing bottom , with errors proportional to the small parameter @xmath62 .    to make contact with well - known results , we evaluate @xmath83 in the standing wave approximation . using @xmath84 , , @xmath85    the wave spectrum",

    "the difference , within the spread of prior derivations , has no influence on the subsequent analysis of the standing wave approximation and the power spectral density matrix .",
    "the implications of the standing wave approximation upon the elements of the psdm , other than @xmath83 , have not been considered previously .",

    "we see also that the spectrum of vertical velocity is 3 db greater than either of the horizontals .",

    "in general , the effect of the bottom is a modification of the green s function appearing in ( [ melements]-[lastmelements ] ) .",

    "the off - diagonal elements ( bottom three rows ) fit the model better at 0.5 hz than at 1.76 , although in neither case has the result been smoothed over the prominent ripples .",
    "the frequency dependence observed in the coherency of the off - diagonal matrix elements is inconsistent with the universal constants predicted by the standing wave approximation in the case of an ocean layer resting on an elastic half - space .",
    "thus , other effects , possibly bottom scattering , are influencing the wave - generated sound at this site . on the other hand , the insensitivity to wind , as predicted by the weak standing wave approximation , is strongly upheld by these data",
    "we have shown that the theoretical predictions of the standing wave approximation are extremely strong , yielding psdm ratios which are universal constants . while it is possible that these psdm ratios are observed under certain conditions , such as a high loss bottom , they are certainly not observed in the h2o data .",
    "bottom effects vitiate the standing wave approximation , leaving in place a weaker version of the approximation , the predictions of which are observed at h2o . in particular , the psdm ratios depend on frequency , but are insensitive to changes in the surface conditions .",
    "direct comparison of the psdm ratios to an elastic half - space model show less agreement .",
    "this is due , presumably , to the oversimplification of the bottom and propagation conditions in the model , as well as to instrument calibration error .",
    "the primitive model of the ocean s bottom replicates the essential features of more elaborate approaches .",
    "pressure is increased a few db because of the bottom , and this increase is uniform over the band 1 - 30 hz , at least .",
    "the augmentation diminishes slightly as the observation depth lessens .",
    "given a quantitative estimate for the influence of the bottom , overhead wave properties can be inferred from ( corrected ) deep pressure observations through application of ( 33 ) , although there is a factor 2 discrepancy between this result and some other theories .",
    "the model of the ocean bottom will need to be extended to account for the layer of ocean sediments before velocity observations can be used for the same purpose .",
    "pressure and vertical velocity are most coherent for frequencies below 1 hz ; indeed , the observed coherence exceeds the model result .",
    "the coherence falls above 1 hz .",
    "the sediments overlying the basement were not modeled , but the decrease in coherence is attributed to p - sv energy trapped in this layer .",
    "this same effect can explain the weak but significant rise at 1 hz in the coherence between horizontal velocity and both pressure and vertical velocity .",
    "we view the peaks in the velocity spectra as evidence of vertically polarized shear waves , naturally excited when a pressure wave in an acoustic medium is incident on an elastic medium .",
    "the extremely low shear velocity of the surficial sediments has two effects : the transmitted sv rays are nearly perpendicular to the boundary and they are strongly polarized in the horizontal direction . the resonance occurs when the rays are efficiently reflected by internally layering in the sediments .",
    "zeldenrust and stephen @xcite applied the theory of godin and chapman @xcite to interpret the resonances at h2o as evidence of a chert layer approximately 13 m below the bottom , about in the middle of the 30 m of sediments .",
    "scattering is a further complication .",
    "any zones in the elastic medium with strong impedance contrasts and rough boundaries will scatter both sv and sh energy .",
    "taking the ocean to have constant sound speed ignores the refraction due to the sound channel ( e.g. ref .  , fig .",
    "however , for a surface layer of incoherent dipoles , the bottom signal is dominated by the source region with diameter six times the water depth ( ref  , eq .",
    "bottom acoustic observations are beginning to be used to estimate the spectrum of ocean surface waves . to do this , within the framework of acoustic radiation from wave - wave interactions , two corrections are necessary .",
    "allowance must be made for the bottom interaction and the overlap integral .",
    "the correction of the pressure spectrum for bottom interaction appears to be straightforward .",
    "the bottom elevates the pressure a few db at the bottom , with a slight decrease moving up the water column away from the bottom .",
    "the bottom effect , in fact , is smaller than the factor - of - two discrepancy between our derivation and some previous results .",
    "it is just as significant that the bottom correction does not depend on frequency .",
    "thus , the theory for the bottomless ocean can be used to infer the slope of the wave spectrum from the slope of the pressure spectrum @xcite with no further corrections .",
    "spectra of bottom velocity at this site are contaminated by sediment effects for @xmath151 hz .",
    "horizontal is more affected than vertical , and models incorporating the sediments will be required to back out this contamination .",
    "data at lower frequencies may still be applicable .",
    "however , all bottom sensors are equally useful for relating changes in the spectrum to changes in overhead waves .",
    "when the nominal transfer function of the h2o hdh hydrophone is adopted , spectral ratios of velocity to ( scaled ) pressure , drop precipitously for frequencies less than 1 hz ( fig . [ diagonals ] ) . at 0.5 hz ,",
    "the observed spectral ratios for both seismic sensors are more than 100 times smaller than theory ( table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "there is more evidence that the nominal gain of the hydrophone is too high at low frequencies .",
    "velocity spectra at low frequencies have been calculated from ecmwf directional wave models , and they are in reasonable agreement with the h2o seismic observations ( ref .  , fig .",
    "4 ) . pressure spectra calculated from the same models are orders of magnitude less than observations .",
    "in addition , the ( scaled ) pressure spectrum at 0.5 hz varies between -95 db and -105 db at h2o , depending on overhead wind ( e.g. figs .",
