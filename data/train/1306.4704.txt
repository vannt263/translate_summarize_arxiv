    "cosmic ray observations provided significant and puzzling deviations from theoretical predictions over the last decades . experiments such as ts @xcite , ams @xcite , caprice @xcite , mass @xcite , and heat @xcite established a hint of an excess of high energy electrons and/or positrons .",
    "measurements of the pamela satellite confirmed these results by finding an excess over the theoretical predictions in the @xmath2 flux for @xmath3 gev @xcite .",
    "the pamela data seem to deviate from the theoretical predictions even when experimental and theoretical uncertainties are taken into account @xcite .",
    "an excess in the @xmath4 flux was also found by ams @xcite , ppb - bets @xcite , and hess @xcite .",
    "recently the fermi - lat satellite confirmed the @xmath4 excess above 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the deviation between the fermi - lat data and the theoretical @xmath4 prediction is significant .",
    "this deviation was recently confirmed by the pamela collaboration which found the @xmath5 flux to be consistent with the fermi - lat data .",
    "many attempts were to explain the deviation between the data and theory .",
    "new physics was invoked ranging from modification of the cosmic ray propagation , through supernova remnants , to dark matter annihilation . ref .",
    "@xcite summarizes these speculations . whether the @xmath0 anomaly exists depends on the theoretical prediction of the cosmic ray background .",
    "the theoretical prediction is challenging because of the lack of precise knowledge of the cosmic ray sources , and because the cosmic ray propagation model has numerous free parameters , such as convection velocities , spatial diffusion coefficients and momentum loss rates .",
    "motivated by traces of possible new physics in the fermi - lat data , we attempt to determine the size of the anomalous contribution in the cosmic @xmath0 flux .",
    "our method involves the following steps .",
    "first we find the cosmic ray propagation parameters that influence the @xmath0 flux measured by fermi - lat and pamela the most .",
    "then we subject the cosmic ray data , other than the fermi - lat and pamela @xmath0 measurements to a bayesian likelihood analysis , to determine the preferred values and the 68 % ( 1-@xmath6 ) credibility regions of the relevant propagation parameters .",
    "based on the central values and 1-@xmath6 credibility regions of these propagation parameters we then predict the background flux , with uncertainties , for fermi - lat and pamela . finally , we extract the anomalous part of the spectrum by subtracting the background prediction from the fermi - lat and pamela measurement .",
    "cosmic ray propagation is described by the diffusion model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes homogeneous propagation of charged particles within the galactic disk and it also takes into account cooling effects .",
    "the phase - space density @xmath7 of a particular cosmic ray species at a galactic radius of @xmath8 can be calculated solving the transport equation which has the general form @xcite @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the source term of primary and secondary cosmic ray contributions .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath11 has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the magnetic rigidity of the particles which describes a particle s resistance to deflection by a magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath15 is the effective nuclear charge of the particle , @xmath16 is its velocity , @xmath17 is its momentum , @xmath18 is its charge , and @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "the exponent @xmath20 indicates the power law dependence of the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "diffusion in momentum space ( diffusive re - acceleration ) is described by the coefficient @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the alfven speed , the parameter @xmath24 characterises the level of hydromagnetic turbulence experienced by the cosmic rays in the interstellar medium @xcite . in eq.([eq : transport ] ) , @xmath25 is the convection velocity and the parameter @xmath26 is the time - scale of the fragmentation loss , and @xmath27 is the radioactive decay time - scale .",
    "the galprop numerical package solves the propagation equation numerically for @xmath28 nuclei , as well as for electrons and positrons on a two dimensional spatial grid with cylindrical symmetry in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the input parameter file for galprop has a number of free parameters which are available for the author to define .",
    "these can be classified into a number of subsets : the diffusion of cosmic ray , the primary cosmic ray sources and radiative energy losses of these primary cosmic rays . the diffusion subset is described by the parameters defined above : @xmath29 the most relevant parameters in the primary cosmic ray source subset are : @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are primary source electron injection indices .",
    "they specifying the steepness of the electron injection spectrum , @xmath33 , below and above of a reference rigidity @xmath34 .",
    "there are separate injection indices for nuclei defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 below and above @xmath37 . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "to reduce the dimension of the parameter space we tested the robustness of the @xmath0 flux against the variation of nearly all individual parameters and found that it is mostly sensitive to the following propagation parameters : @xmath38 here @xmath31 and @xmath36 are the primary electron and nucleus injection indices , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are spatial diffusion coefficients below and above a reference rigidity @xmath41 , and @xmath42 determines the normalization of the spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "our calculations confirmed the findings of a recent study by @xcite that the @xmath0 flux is sensitive to the change of the galactic plane height @xmath43 .",
    "indeed @xcite have shown that there is a connection between @xmath43 and @xmath42 : @xmath44 thus , varying the cylinder height amounts to the redefinition of @xmath42 as also noticed by ref .",
    "@xcite . in the light of this , we fix @xmath43 to 4 kpc and use @xmath42 as free parameter .",
    "we treat the normalizations of the @xmath5 , @xmath45 , @xmath46/p , b / c , ( sc+ti+v)/fe and be-10/be-9 fluxes as theoretical nuisances parameters .",
    "@xmath47    when evaluating the uncertainties , following @xcite , we ignore theoretical uncertainties and combine statistical and systematic experimental uncertainties in quadrature @xmath48 this can be done for fermi - lat and the latest pamela @xmath5 flux .",
    "unfortunately , systematic uncertainties are not available for the rest of the cosmic ray measurements .",
    "when this is the case , as an estimate of the systematics , we define @xmath49 as the rescaled statistical uncertainty @xmath50 for simplicity , in this study , we use the same scale factor @xmath51 for all data points where systematic uncertainty is not available . to remain mostly consistent with the work of @xcite , we set this common scale factor to a conservative value that they use : @xmath52 .",
    "we checked that our conclusions only mildly depend on this choice .",
    "further details about our bayesian parameter inference can be found in @xcite .",
    "we included 219 of the most recent experimental data points in our statistical analysis .",
    "these contained 114 @xmath0 related , and 105 @xmath53 , b / c , ( sc+ti+v)/fe and be-10/be-9 cosmic ray flux measurements . these data are summarized in table [ tab : data ] .",
    ".cosmic ray experiments and their energy ranges over which we have chosen the data points for our analysis .",
    "we split the data into two groups : @xmath0 flux related ( first five lines in the table ) , and the rest .",
    "we perform two independent bayesian analyses to show the significant tension between the two data sets . [",

    "in this section we investigate whether the present cosmic ray data justify the existence of an anomaly in the @xmath0 spectrum . to this end",
    "we divide the cosmic ray data into two groups : 114 measurements containing observations of @xmath0 fluxes ( ams , fermi , hess , and pamela ) and the rest of 105 data points ( @xmath53 , b / c , ( sc+ti+v)/fe , be-10/be-9 ) .",

    "our interpretation of the tension between the @xmath0 fluxes and the rest of the cosmic ray data is that the measurements of pamela and fermi - lat are affected by new physics which is unaccounted for by the propagation model and/or cosmic ray sources included in our calculation .",

    "our background predictions ( magenta bands ) are also overlaid.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in our interpretation the deviation is a statistically significant signal of the presence of new physics in the @xmath56 flux .",
    "based on the difference between the central values of the data and the background a similar conclusion can be drawn from pamela .",
    "unfortunately , the sizable uncertainties for the pamela measurements prevent us to claim a statistically significant deviation . after having determined the background for the @xmath0 fluxes",
    ", we subtract it from the measured flux to obtain the size of the new physics signal .",
    "results for the @xmath0 anomaly are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backgrounds ] .",
    "as expected based on the background predictions a non - vanishing anomaly can be established for the fermi - lat @xmath56 flux , while no anomaly with statistical significance can be claimed for pamela due to the large uncertainties .",
    "based on the available evidence we can only speculate about the origin of the discrepancy between the data and predictions of the cosmic electron - positron spectra .",
    "the first obvious assumption is that some aspect of the propagation model used in the present calculation is insufficient for the proper description of the electron - positron fluxes arriving at earth @xcite . in this case",
    "there exists no anomaly in the data .",
    "assuming that the propagation model satisfactorily describes physics over the galaxy the next reasonable thing is to suspect local effects modifying the electron - positron distribution @xcite .",
    "further suspicion falls on the lack of sources included in the calculation @xcite .",
    "possible new sources of cosmic rays to account for the anomaly have been proposed in two major categories .",
    "the first category is standard astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants , pulsars , various objects in the galactic centre , etc .",
    "finally , more exotic explanations call for new astronomical and/or particle physics phenomena , such as dark matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite we compared our extracted signal to recent predictions of anomalous sources .",
    "we considered predictions from supernova remnants , nearby pulsars and dark matter annihilation .",
    "we concluded that presently uncertainties are too large and prevent us from judging the validity of these as explanations of the anomaly . with more data and more precise calculations the various suggestions of the cosmic @xmath4 anomaly",
