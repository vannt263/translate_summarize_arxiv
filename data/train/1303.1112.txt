    "consider the automaton @xmath246 reading @xmath254 , and the states it enters immediately after reading each of the letters @xmath256 from the word @xmath248 .",
    "since the number of letters @xmath256 exceeds @xmath215 , the automaton enters the same state after reading two different letters @xmath256 .",

    "malcev presentations are a special type of semigroup presentation for semigroups embeddable into groups .",
    "informally , a malcev presentation defines a semigroup by means of generators , defining relations , and a rule of group - embedability .",

    "* chapter  12 ) ) .",
    "the theory of malcev presentations was relatively inactive until recent work by the present author and collaborators @xcite ; see also the survey article  @xcite .      if @xmath281 is a set of malcev congruences on @xmath13 , then @xmath282 is also a malcev congruence on @xmath13 .",
    "this is true because @xmath283 embeds in a group @xmath284 for each @xmath285 , so @xmath280 embeds in @xmath286 , which in turn embeds in @xmath287 .",
    "the following definition therefore makes sense .",
    "[ def : malpres ] let @xmath288 be a free semigroup ; let @xmath289 be any binary relation on @xmath288 . denote by @xmath290 the smallest malcev congruence containing @xmath291  namely , @xmath292 then @xmath293 is a for [ any semigroup isomorphic to ] @xmath294 .",
