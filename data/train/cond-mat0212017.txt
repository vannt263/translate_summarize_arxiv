    "landau - zener ( lz ) theory is one of the most important and influential results in non - stationary quantum mechanics .",
    "last decade a generalization of lz theory to more than two states attracted particular attention due to numerous applications in atomic and molecular physics @xcite , @xcite , nanomagnets @xcite , bose - einstein condensate @xcite and systems with avoided band crossings @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the multi - state lz problem ( see for example @xcite ) is concerned with finding of the transition amplitudes for a system with the hamiltonian , whose matrix form reads :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a diagonal matrix and the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath1 are independent of time . in its general form",
    "this problem is still unsolved , but a number of exact results for special choices of the matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 were found .    in almost all available exact solutions the transition probabilities are expressed in terms of the genuine two - level lz formula successively applied at each diabatic level intersection . in other physical problems such a procedure is often applied as an approximation .",
    "these problems include atomic and molecular collisions @xcite and the transitions at crossing of two rydberg multiplets of energy levels @xcite .    in this work",
    "we find very simple ansatz that generates new solvable models and may explain the properties of already known solutions .",
    "the main idea employs the single - particle hamiltonian which acts independently in several two - dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while results in one - particle sector are trivial , the same hamiltonian generates non - trivial solutions in the many particle spaces . such a construction is akin to the group - theoretical method of finding higher irreducible representations as a symetrized direct product of the fundamental representation . using this method we can study the problem of driven charge transport through a quantum dot and find new solutions in multistate lz theory .",
    "particularly , we derive the transition probabilities for a four state lz problem which is very similar to the four state bow - tie model and for a problem of intersection of two bands of parallel levels .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii we show how already known solutions of lz models can generate new exactly solvable models with the hamiltonian ( [ mlz ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate how the exact solution for two independent two level systems can generate a new solution of a four - state lz model . in iii we generalize demkov - osherov solution to the case of many particles and use the result for derivation of master equations that describe a driven charge transport in quantum dots .",
    "in iv we provide an example of a solvable model that can be generated from the demkov - osherov solution .",
    "lets consider a hamiltonian that describes the interaction of four bosonic fields @xmath3 :    @xmath4    this hamiltonian depends explicitly on time and conserves the total number of particles in the system . therefore it can be considered independently in subspaces with fixed total number of particles .",
    "let @xmath5 be the vacuum state .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) describes the evolution of two disjointed systems .",
    "however , being projected onto the 2-particle sector , its matrix form looks less trivial .",
    "the complete two - particle sector is the 10-dimensional hilbert space spanned onto direct products of any two single - particle states .",
    "the four - dimensional subspace @xmath6 of the 2-particle sector spanned onto vectors : @xmath7 is invariant with respect to the action of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) . hence",
    ", if the initial state belongs to this subspace , the state vector at any time remains in @xmath6 :    @xmath8    in the basis ( [ states ] ) the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) has the following 4x4 matrix form :    @xmath9    the problem described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) belongs to the multistate landau - zener class ( [ mlz ] ) .",
    "we should point out that it can not be mapped on the already known exactly solvable multistate lz models .",
    "-2 in    in @xmath10 we show the adiabatic energies of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) as functions of time for typical choice of parameters .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is a point of an exact adiabatic level crossing ( diabolic point ) on the figure .    in the heisenberg representation",
    "the evolution equations decouple into two pairs of equations for bosonic operators :    @xmath11    and @xmath12 let @xmath13 denote the operators @xmath14 at the initial moment of evolution",
    ". then the solutions of equations ( [ eqq1 ] ) and ( [ eqq2 ] ) are :    @xmath15    @xmath16    here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the matrix elements of the evolution operators for ( [ eqq1 ] ) and ( [ eqq2 ] ) , respectively . due to the linearity they are the same for the operator and numerical functions obeying these differential equations .",
    "hence , we can extract them directly from the solution of the two - state lz problem .",
    "for the evolution from @xmath19 to @xmath20 their squares of modulus are : @xmath21 returning to the four - state lz problem in the two - particle sector considered earlier , we first note that each state @xmath22 of this subspace is the direct product of states from two independent subspaces of the one - particle sector @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( note that here 1,2,3,4 enumerate single - particle state , for example @xmath25 ) .",
    "the evolution matrix is also the direct product of evolution matrices in the independent subspaces of the one - particle sectors : @xmath26 .",
    "therefore transition matrix elements and probabilities @xmath27 in the considered subspace are factorized : @xmath28 in terms of the lz probabilities for two - level problems introduced earlier the transition probability matrix @xmath29 , whose elements are defined by equation ( [ factorization ] ) , reads : @xmath30 this result does not depend on the parameters @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting that scattering matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 are known for any @xmath34 @xcite which make it possible to find the evolution operator at any time in the schrdinger representation .",
    "in similar fashion to the previous section the fermionic systems can lead to heisenberg equations for annihilation operators that have the same structure as shrdinger equation for amplitudes for some exactly solvable multistate landau - zener model . as we will show , in the shrdinger representation such a fermi system with fixed number of particle is equivalent to a new solvable multistate landau - zener model .",
    "the models that we will examine correspond to the driven charge transport in nanostructures .    consider a quantum dot coupled to an external reservoir like the system shown in @xmath35 .",
    "lets consider that initially some of the reservoir energy levels are filled with electrons , the others are empty . lets assume the dot has only one electron bound state whose energy in real semiconductors can be regulated by the gate voltage ; therefore the variation of the gate voltage with time generates time dependence of the dot s electronic level .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electrons in the dot and reservoir reads : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the fermionic operator that annihilates the electron on the dot level and @xmath38 is the annihilation operators for the level @xmath39 of the reservoir ; @xmath40 is the time - dependent energy of the dot state . in our treatment",
    "the last term in ( [ h1 ] ) describes the tunneling between the leads and the single level in the quantum dot .",
    "we ignore all interactions among electrons except the one due to pauli principle .",
    "similar time - dependent single - particle problems for quantum dots have been already considered in @xcite . though our system is simplified but rather it is interesting because it has an exact solution .    in the context of lz theory , we approximate the dot energy by a linear function of time : @xmath41 .",
    "the heisenberg operator equations corresponding to hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) are :    @xmath42    due to the linear structure of these equations the solution can be formally written in the matrix form : @xmath43 where @xmath44    as in the previous section , the evolution matrix @xmath45 is completely determined by the coefficients of the differential equations ( [ se1 ] ) and is the same for operator and c - function solutions .",
    "hence , it is enough to solve ( [ se1 ] ) with all operators replaced by c - functions . such a system of equations coincides with that of the demkov - osherov model @xcite .",
    "the latter provides transition amplitudes for a single energy level crossing an energy band consisting of time - independent levels .    in demkov - osherov model the shrdinger equation for the amplitudes of different quantum states can be written as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are ordered as follows @xmath48 ( assuming that none two of the @xmath47 are equal ; we also assume for definiteness that @xmath49 ) .",
    "the absolute values of the @xmath50-matrix components",
    "( @xmath51 @xcite are :    @xmath52    ( where the index @xmath53 and @xmath54 )    the probabilities to find an electron on a particular @xmath55-th level are .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 and the summation is taken over the initially filled states only .",
    "the scattering matrix elements @xmath58 are given in ( [ d10 ] ) . if the band of electron states in the external system is continuous then it is reasonable to use the approximation , in which @xmath59 while the value @xmath60 is kept finite . here",
    "@xmath61 is the density of states in the band and the elements of scattering matrix become @xmath62    now lets consider a dot that is connected to two leads .",
    "the left lead is characterized by the coupling function @xmath63 and the densities @xmath64 , @xmath65 where f and e refer to the filled and empty states in the left lead ( @xmath66 ) , analogously we can define the quantities @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the right lead . moreover it is more convenient to introduce the following notations : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "if the dot state was initially empty and if this state crosses the region from energy @xmath75 to energy @xmath76 , then in the continuous approximation ( [ pnum1 ] ) leads to the following probability for the dot level to be finally filled after all landau - zener transitions :    @xmath77}de^{\\prime } \\label{p0}\\ ] ]    if the dot level was initially filled , it is necessary to add @xmath78 to ( [ p0 ] ) .",
    "one can check that the result ( [ p0 ] ) is the solution of the following system of differential equations :    @xmath79    here @xmath80 is the probability that the dot level will be empty when it has energy @xmath81 .",
    "the equation for the charge that is transferred to the right lead can be derived in a similar way    @xmath82    note that equations ( [ dp]),([dq ] ) were derived from the exact solution of the problem with microscopic hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) rather than from random phase approximation or other type of phenomenology .",
    "let us calculate the total charge transferred through the dot from the left lead to the right lead at zero temperature and a fixed bias that leads to a difference of fermi energies in the left and in the right leads .",
    "lets assume that the dot level was initially much lower than both fermi levels and it was filled",
    ". then the energy of this state grows linearly with time crossing both fermi levels during the evolution . since transitions will proceed",
    "presumably when the dot level is between fermi energies of the leads , we can apply the following approximations : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constant . to find the total charge that is transferred to the right lead we formally put the final dot state energy equal to infinity in the solution of the equations ( [ dp ] ) and ( [ dq ] ) . in the result",
    "the total charge transfered to the right lead is    @xmath89   \\label{q}\\ ] ]    clearly at @xmath90 we find @xmath91 , which can be interpreted as the electron charge @xmath92 multiplied by the probability for the electron that is initially placed into the dot to transfer to the right lead .",
    "in this section we will construct a new solvable lz model employing the fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) projected onto the @xmath93-particle sector generates the evolution in the hilbert space of dimensionality @xmath94 .",
    "if we assume that the single - particle hamiltonian laying in the background is the same as that of the demkov - osherov model , then all such models are reducible to this single - particle one .",
    "generalized landau - zener models that deal with intersections of bands of parallel levels are important in many applications such as in driven tunneling of nanomagnets coupled to nuclear spins @xcite and in driven charge transport in quantum dots @xcite .    up to now only two exact solutions of this type",
    "were known : demkov - osherov solution and the case of the infinite number of states in bands that equally interact with states of another band @xcite , @xcite . for an important case of a finite number of states in bands that is not equal to unity",
    "exact solutions for all transition probabilities have not been found yet though the absence of counterintuitive transitions was analytically proved @xcite .",
    "nearly - exact solution valid in the quasidegeneracy approximation was found and investigated in @xcite",
    ". we will show that our method can be used to generate exactly solvable models with interband transitions .",
    "lets consider a system of two fermi particles with the hamiltonian @xmath95 let @xmath96 . as we demonstrated previously , the solution of the operator evolution equation can be written in the form :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the matrix of evolution for a 4-state demkov - osherov model .",
    "lets restrict the hilbert space to the subspace of only two particles .",
    "it includes six states : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "similarly to the bosonic case , this subspace is invariant during the evolution process .",
    "the hamiltonian restricted to this subspace has the following matrix form : @xmath105    let @xmath27 ( @xmath106 ) be the probability to transit from the state @xmath107 to the state @xmath108 after the band crossing .",
    "the transition probabilities can be expressed in terms of the fermi - operators in the heisenberg representation at @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110    substituting ( [ vec2 ] ) into ( [ pmn ] ) and employing the elements of the evolution matrix from ( [ d10 ] ) we get the following result : @xmath111 where    @xmath112",
    "in conclusion , we presented the procedure that generates new exactly solvable multi - state lz models . some of them are useful for the description of driven charge transport in quantum dots and driven tunneling in nanomagnets . as an example , we derived two new solvable models and found the transition probability matrices for them .      1 .   the demkov - osherov model .",
    "2 .   the @xmath113 symmetry class that deals with an arbitrary spin in external magnetic field with the following hamiltonian : + @xmath114 3 .   the generalized bow - tie model that treats the case when two levels are parallel while the other levels intersect at one point between the parallel ones .",
    "this list can be extended with different generalizations of these models to the case of degenerate states .",
    "for example , it is possible to solve the lz model for two degenerate levels by changing basis in such a way that all equations decouple into independent two state landau - zener transitions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that sometimes a few elements of transition probability matrix can be found while the others remain unknown @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these models provide very simple results .",
    "for example , transition probabilities in the demkov - osherov model coincide with those taken from successive application of the two state landau - zener formula .",
    "the same is true for the generalized bow - tie model .",
    "finally in all models the transition probabilities are simple polynomials of @xmath115 ) and the generalized bow - tie model are very similar . at @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) belongs to the class of generalized bow - tie models .",
    "also we note that models of @xmath113 class @xcite can be derived from the following bosonic hamiltonian :      in the single - particle sector the hamiltonian ( [ bh ] ) leads to the simple two - state lz model . in the @xmath119-boson sector the schrdinger equation for diabatic states coincides with ones for a spin @xmath120 in magnetic fields .",
    "this construction is an application of the schwinger bosons @xcite to the lz problem .",
