    "the nearby virgo cluster is a largely extended and complex structure of over 1300 galaxies and represents the major feature of the local supercluster .",
    "based on the pioneering work by de vaucouleurs ( 1961 ) , the photographic las campanas survey by binggeli et al .",
    "( 1985 , hereafter the virgo cluster catalog or vcc ) and a complementary collection of galaxy redshifts ( binggeli et al .  1993 ) , a number of subclumps and gravitationally unbound clouds were identified in virgo from imaging and recessional velocity data .",
    "centrally located are two separate subclumps each dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy , i.e. m87 and m86 ( see binggeli 1999 ) . on a large scale",
    "there is another structure along the north - south axis of the virgo cluster , defined by the northern m87/m86 subclumps ( called `` cluster a '' in binggeli et al .",
    "1987 ) and the southern galaxy concentration around m49 , called here the `` m49 subclump '' (= `` cluster b '' ) .",
    "these subclusters are bound to the south and west by three galaxy clouds named w , w ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) , and m ( ftaclas et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "the knowledge of a precise distance to the virgo cluster or more generally a good understanding of its three dimensional structure plays an important role in many research areas of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "however , despite the large effort to resolve these issues over the past decades , the spatial extension of the virgo cluster remained highly uncertain .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "firstly , only a relative small number of cluster member galaxies had accurate distance measurements .",
    "secondly , the typical target objects were spiral galaxies which reside , according to the morphology  density relation ( dressler 1980 ) , in the outskirts of galaxy clusters .",
    "so it should come as no surprise that using accurate distance indicators like cepheids and supernovae of type ia revealed a significant distance spread among the virgo spirals ranging from 15mpc ( eg .",
    "graham et al .",
    "1999 ; saha et al .",
    "2001 ) to 25mpc ( eg .",
    "saha et al .",
    "these heavily disputed results simply reflect the line - of - sight depth of the large spiral halo of the virgo cluster and demonstated why accurate distance measurements of only a few spirals are of limited use .",
    "progress towards a precise mapping of the 3d - structure of the virgo cluster region was made only when the numbers of spiral galaxy distances were increased ( e.g.  yasuda et al .",
    "1997 ) . alternatively , fundamental plane distance measurements ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) and surface brightness fluctuations ( neilsen & tsvetanov 2000 ; tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) were employed to locate the more centrally concentrated early - type giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "similar to the giant brethren , the less luminous and more elusive dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are well confined to the highest galaxy densities in a cluster ( the morphology  density relation for dwarfs , binggeli et al .",
    "but it is their occurrence in large numbers in cluster cores ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; jerjen & dressler 1997 ) that makes them unique and even more valuable than giant ellipticals .",
    "dwarf ellipticals are the only galaxy type that flag the gravitational center(s ) in a galaxy cluster _ and _ are available in statistically sufficient numbers .    despite the great potential des offer to examine the densest regions of galaxy clusters only little",
    "work has been done with des to date due to the lack of an accurate and practical distance indicator .",
    "correlations between global parameters of des such as the effective surface brightness  luminosity relation ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) or the shape parameter  luminosity relation ( jerjen & binggeli 1997 ; binggeli & jerjen 1998 ) have considerable scatter and thus are not reliable to measure individual distances . instead , the resolution power of the hst has to be used to resolve the stellar populations of des to establish distances by means of the tip magnitude of the red giant branch ( trgb , e.g.  karachentsev et al .",
    "while this approach works well for nearby des it becomes exceedingly difficult ( crowding effects ) and expensive ( long integration times ) to obtain good s / n stellar photometry at the required limiting magnitude with larger distances .",
    "this explains why the trgb method was applied to only one de ( vcc1104 or ic3388 ) in the virgo cluster ( harris et al .",
    "1998 ) to date .",
    "considering the limitation of the trgb method , another distance indicator has emerged as a substitute for measuring accurate distances to des beyond 10mpc from the local group .",
    "this is the surface brightness fluctuation method based on the discrete sampling of an _ unresolved _ stellar population in a galaxy with a ccd detector and the resulting poisson fluctuations in the number of stars within a resolution element ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) . the method has been extensively tested in the sculptor group ( jerjen et al .",
    "1998 ) , centaurus a group ( jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ) , m81 group , the canes venatici cloud and the near field ( jerjen et al .",
    "first results from dwarf ellipticals in the more distant fornax cluster ( jerjen 2003 ) and centaurus cluster ( mieske et al .  2003 ) were reported recently .",
    "the high accuracy of the method ( @xmath19% ) opens up the possibility to measure precise distances to cluster des in a simple and efficient way .",
    "the goal of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we will measure the surface brightness fluctuation distances of a sample of 16 dwarf elliptical galaxies in the direction of the virgo cluster .",
    "we introduce the dwarf galaxies with their basic properties in  2 . in ",
    "3 we describe the observations and data reduction . in ",
    "4 we will carry out the sbf analysis and calculate the fluctuation signals .",
    "we determine the sbf distances of the sample galaxies in  5 .",
    "second , we will investigate the distance distribution of the dwarfs in the context of the 3d - structure of the cluster in  6 .",
    "lastly , we will estimate rough metallicities and ages for our early - type galaxies in  7 using the fluctuation magnitudes and b - r broadband colour .",
    "our conclusions are given in  8 .",
    "to follow - up the question on the 3d - distribution of the de population in the virgo cluster and to search for the gravitational centre(s ) of the cluster , we have studied a sample of 16 early - type dwarfs from the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) . as it is a main requirement for the successful application of the sbf method , galaxies were primarily selected on their morphological appearance , i.e. type `` de(,n ) '' or `` ds0(,n ) '' and on their apparent size , i.e.  an isophotal radius @xmath20 and small ellipticity . within these constraints , dwarfs were chosen in a way to get a good coverage in velocity space ( @xmath21kms@xmath22@xmath231850kms@xmath22 ) and in the celestial distribution ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) .",
    "a few dwarfs like vcc0810 simply came into our sample because they were close neighbours of our target galaxy .",
    "finally , we added the nucleated de galaxy vcc1104 ( ic3388 ) to the sample .",

    "deep ccd images of the virgo des have been acquired in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 passbands in service mode using the two first units of the very large telescope at eso paranal observatory over a period of two semesters : at ut1+fors1 during an observing run on july 1014 , 1999 and at ut2+fors2 during dark time periods in march  may , 2000 .",

    "flatfielding with the masterflats did produce no satisfactory results in all cases and reliable nightflats , which might have worked better , were unfortunately impossible to construct from the science frames . to remove the background gradients noticeable in some of the images , above all in the @xmath1 ( or @xmath32 ) frames , we fitted instead third - order polynomials to the sky background ( see barazza et al .",
    "2003 for more details ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the residual images due to this sky flattening problem was measured less than 0.1% over the full ccd area in all passbands , with the random errors being much smaller .",
    "all ccd data were acquired on nights with photometric sky quality . in service mode ,",
    "a series of landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standard stars are observed in various passbands under different airmasses every night .",
    "fields which contained saturated standard stars when using short exposure times ( @xmath33sec ) were reobserved in the low gain mode .",
    "the analysis of fields taken in both gain modes confirmed the inverse gain ratios for the four ccd quadrants given in the fors1 + 2 user manual issue 2.1 of eso .",
    "finally , we scaled the low gain frames to match the high gain images . in that way , photometric data over a larger magnitude range became available . from each series of standard stars observations we computed photometric zero points , extinction coefficients and color terms using the iraf package .",
    "for the observing period 65 the extinction coefficients and color terms could be compared with the values reported by the vlt quality control and trending services ( hanuschik & silva 2002 ) finding good agreement :    @xmath34    the photometric zero points varied significantly over the observing period 65 .",

    "( e.g.  vcc0929 , vcc1010 , and vcc1355 ) is straightforward as the colour  fluctuation magnitude relation is unambiguously represented by eq .  1 .",

    "there , the decision which of the equations to use has to be made based on the observed trend between colour and fluctuation magnitude for the analysed sbf fields . in some cases there is also independent distance information available that renders one of the two solutions more likely than the other .",
    "the requirement , or desideratum to cover a colour range as large as possible has to be borne in mind during the sbf field selection , but sometimes it is impossible to achieve due to the lack of a colour gradient in the dwarf ( barazza et al .",

    "( 1998 ) . as the tip magnitude of the red giant branch has been shown to be an accurate distance indicator for old and metal - poor stellar populations ( e.g.  da costa & armandroff 1990 ; gratton et al .",

    "vcc0810 , vcc1036 , vcc1087 , and vcc1261 , where the colour range is too small and where no independent distance information as in the case of vcc1104 is available to break the colour branch ambiguity .",
    "their data can be technically fitted either by the linear or the parabolic equation and thus two distances can be inferred for them .",

    "the dominant source of this uncertainty is the error in the @xmath58 colour through its strong amplification by the steep colour - fluctuation magnitude relation .",
    "this can be compensated only by having a large number of fields for the sbf analysis ; the more fields the smaller the resulting error .",
    "the relatively large galaxy sample with sbf distances available allows us to check the quality of our distance calibration . for that purpose we followed neilsen & tsvetanov ( 2000 ) and tested our data for a possible correlation between the colour and distance modulus . fig .",

    "at a first glance , there seems to be a slight trend in the data for redder galaxies to have shorter distances .",
    "but looking more closely , this impression comes mainly from the relatively short distance of the reddest dwarf vcc0929 .",
    "do we have reasons to think that vcc0929 is indeed at the near side of the virgo cluster ?",

    "however , as the distance distribution of des is broad and highly non - symmetric ( see below ) , a discussion of the cluster mean distance is not very meaningful anymore ; the derived mean value is obviously highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of single objects of the sample .",
    "a coarse measure of the distance spread is provided by the standard deviation of de distance moduli : @xmath80 = 0.245 mag .",

    "the slightly prolate distribution of des found here is in excellent agreement with neilsen & tsvetanov ( 2000 ) and west & blakeslee ( 2000 ) who used the sbf method to determine the distances to giant ellipticals in virgo .",

    "( 2001 ) that are found in our surveyed area ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "the 11 ellipticals studied in both references are weighted half at each distance .    to test the bimodality in the distance distribution against the conservative assumption that the entire galaxy sample was drawn from a single gaussian distribution we used the adaptive kernel method ( vio et al .",

    "thereby , distances for giant elliptical galaxies with two independent measurements ( neilsen & tsevtanov 2000 ; tonry et al .",

    "the two galaxy concentrations at @xmath95mag and @xmath12mag were found to be significant at the 99% ( 2.5@xmath5 ) and 89% ( @xmath14 ) level , respectively .",
    "it should also be noted that any asymmetric feature in the true distance distribution tends to be washed out by the errors in the individual distances , i.e.  the two peaks will in reality be much narrrower .",
    "what could this bimodality mean ?",
    "it has previously been noted ( binggeli et al .",
    "1993 , binggeli 1999 ) that the virgo cluster core ( cluster a ) shows a pronounced double structure in the projected spatial distribution and in the kinematics of the galaxies .",
    "the main , most massive and galaxy - rich clump of cluster a , and of the whole cluster is clearly centered on the supergiant e galaxy m87 ( ngc4486 ) .",
    "a secondary , less massive and less rich clump , lying about 1@xmath96 nw to m87 , is centered on the giant galaxy m86 ( ngc4406 ) .",
    "members of this secondary clump are found to have systematically smaller radial velocities ; in particular , all negative velocities tend to be clustered in the m86 region ( binggeli et al .",
    "1993 , binggeli 1999 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of an infall , or subcluster merging scenario .",
    "given the observed kinematic pattern , the m86 subcluster seems to be falling into the main m87 subcluster _ from the backside_. in consequence , we might expect to see a bimodality in the distance distribution of virgo cluster galaxies : a somewhat larger , broader population peaking at a slightly lower - than - average distance , and a smaller , possibly narrower population peaking at a slightly higher - than - average distance , with a separation of 1 to a few mpc .",
    "not only is this exactly what we see in fig .",
    "[ distmodhisto ] , very intriguingly the distance modulus of the primary , higher and closer peak , @xmath97 = 31.00 , roughly coincides with the mean sbf distance modulus for m87 measured by tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and neilsen & tsevtanov ( 2000 ) : @xmath98mag .",

    "the bimodal distance distribution of e and de galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster is therefore naturally explained by the subcluster merging scenario proposed before ( binggeli et al.1993 , binggeli 1999 ) .",
    "the m87 and m86 subclusters seem to be separated by @xmath101 0.3 , or @xmath102 2.5 mpc . with individual distances and radial velocities available for a fairly large sample of es and des",

    "however , there is a clear infall signature traced out by the galaxies with negative velocities . as mentioned before , most of these are clustered around m86 ( ngc4406 ) , which has a negative velocity itself .",

    "ngc4419 is an exception , lying in the north of the cluster and being classified as sa in the vcc .",
    "this galaxy likely belongs to a population of surrounding late - type galaxies that have recently fallen into the cluster ( see the discussion in vcc ) .",
    "whether vcc0810 , for which two possible distances have been derived ( cf .  table [ distmods ] ) , is approaching the cluster from behind for the first time or has already fallen through it while still maintaining such a large relative ( negative ) velocity , is difficult to judge without detailed modeling .",
    "the long distance of vcc0810 would in any case appear more likely now , as it is perfectly in accord , like the distances and velocities of m86 , vcc00928 , vcc0815 , and vcc0846 , with the virgocentric infall model of kraan - korteweg ( 1986 ) .",
