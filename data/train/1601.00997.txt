    "transport in nonautonomous ( unsteady ) flows such as in oceanic and atmospheric jets and eddies / vortices / rings , or microfluidic channels with several fluids , is well - known to be strongly influenced by dominant flow structures and separators .",
    "examples include the invisible flow barrier off the west coast of florida which protected the coast during the deepwater horizon oil spill , the antarctic polar vortex , and the interface between a microdroplet and a carrier fluid in a microchannel .",
    "these structures all move with time , and the ability to demarcate , manipulate , or control the flow across , such structures has profound implications at a range of scales from the geophysical to the nanofluidic . over the last decade or two ,",
    "the connection between such flow barriers and the dynamical systems concepts of stable and unstable manifolds has become well - established @xcite .",
    "the results of this article are motivated by the desire to control these flow separators in a way that one chooses , with the idea of being able to govern the transport occurring in microfluidic devices .",
    "the fact that the flow is of low reynolds number at microscales means that fluid mixing is suppressed ; yet in many devices the wish is to improve mixing . by manipulating the flow separators , i.e. , the stable and unstable manifolds",
    ", one can focus directly on the transport templates which regulate fluid mixing .    in autonomous ( steady ) flows defined for infinite times",
    ", the concepts of saddle - like fixed points and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors enable the determination of stable and unstable manifolds locally .",
    "global _ structure of these invariant manifolds form a template which governs transport in space , yet their _ local _ structure ( and indeed global definitions in terms of exponential decays ) are associated directly with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in particular ,",
    "the directions in which these emanate locally from the saddle point are defined by the eigenvectors .",
    "unfortunately , in _ nonautonomous _ flows defined only for _ finite _ times  i.e .",
    ", for any realistic situation based for example on observational or experimental data_instantaneously computed _ fixed points , eigenvalues or eigenvectors have no relevance to transport",
    ".    there are a variety of diagnostic techniques which purportedly identify transport templates in nonautonmous flows which are defined over finite times .",
    "there are variously defined as entities of extremal attraction / repulsion @xcite , minimal instantaneous flux / deformation @xcite , extremal curve / surface length / area deformation @xcite or extremal curvature deformation @xcite , or ridges extracted from finite - time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) fields @xcite or transfer ( perron - frobenius ) operator singular vector fields @xcite .",
    "alternative methods identify these using topological braid theory @xcite , ergodic theory @xcite or various averages along trajectories @xcite .",
    "each of these diverse methods offer computational tools for extracting precisely its own definition ; there are few theoretically established connections between them @xcite .",
    "the _ hyperbolic_-type transport templates can be construed as _ boundaries _ between coherent structures , and are therefore of great importance in any transport characterisation .",
    "these are characterised in table  [ table : analogues ] , and in all these situations , one focus is essentially determining the third column of table  [ table : analogues ] , which will be different for each diagnostic method .",
    "for the specific case of ftles ( noting that ftles are not always valid @xcite ) , this column would arguably have ( a ) intersections of forward- and backward - time ftle ridges , ( b ) ftle values , and ( c ) tangents to ftle ridges .",

    ", this article develops techniques which are relevant when the flow is nearly autonomous , that is , when the nonautonomous component appears as a perturbation on an autonomous ( steady ) flow . a frequently considered assumption in oceanographic and other flows @xcite",
    ", this form of model has additional appeal since it can be considered a particular realisation of a stochastic perturbation , a theme which is attracting considerable recent attention @xcite . from the microfluidic perspective ,",
    "this assumption has value when the idea is to disturb a steady laminar flow ( in which transport is suppressed ) by imposing an agitation velocity in order to promote transport @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : finite ] addresses the relaxation of the infinite - time results to finite times , when entities reminiscent of stable and unstable manifolds appear to be present .",
    "( defining them using exponential dichotomies fails since _ anything _ can be imputed to be bounded by an exponentially decaying function over finite times ; various approaches @xcite have been suggested to tackle this . )",
    "a common approach for finite times is to consider the flow from a certain fixed initial time to a fixed final time , governed by a specified nonautonomous velocity field @xcite .",
    "the flow map for this time interval can be obtained computationally , for example , by flowing forward many trajectories , and thereafter transport issues are usually analysed using just this one - step flow map .",
    "nonautonomy is sometimes ( but not always ) implicit in this approach by allowing either the initial or final time to vary , but this requires performing calculations for differing flow maps @xcite .",
    "finite - time reality might be better approximated if assuming that the velocity data is available over a fixed finite - time interval @xmath0 $ ] ( possibly at discrete values ) , but that nonautonomous information is required for times @xmath1 , using _ all _ the available data at each instance in time @xcite . under this interpretation , in the nearly autonomous situation , leading - order expressions for the finite - time versions of hyperbolic trajectories and local tangent vectors to their associated stable and unstable manifolds are furnished .",
    "this approach effectively supplies an alternative  which generalises stable / unstable manifolds in nearly autonomous flows  to the third column in table  [ table : analogues ] .",

    "since theorem  [ theorem : control ] provides the methodology of pointing stable and unstable manifolds in user - desired time - varying directions , this provides insight into how best to focus energy in the most relevant areas , in order to obtain desired mixing characteristics .",

    "this is performed via a two - step analysis : first , the theory is used to determine the nonautonomous velocity for @xmath1 needed to have hyperbolic trajectories follow user - defined motion , with their stable and unstable manifolds also rotating in a specified time - varying fashion , and second , the data is used to _ a posteriori _ verify the errors implied by the finite - time definitions .",
    "two different types of nonautonomous perturbations are evaluated : a time - periodic manifold rotation with fairly large nonautonomous part , and an abruptly changing hyperbolic trajectory location and manifold rotation .",
    "these examples were chosen to deliberately challenge the expected realm of viability of the theory , but in both cases , excellent results were obtained when compared with ftle computations .",
    "the techniques therefore offer substantial promise in controlling directions of emanation of coherent structure boundaries in finite - time nonautonomous flows , with additional insights into how these directions are related to the local velocity shear .",
