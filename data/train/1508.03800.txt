    "for decades we want to know what a graph looks like .",
    "we want to reveal the principles of the networks behaviour covered by their complex topology and dynamics .",
    "we want to learn about how the network structure evolves over time and how it affects the properties of dynamical processes on it . for the nature of decentrality of real networks ,",
    "it is hard to observe the networks directly .",
    "instead we observe them by taking snapshots of their network structure and content and keep updating them .",
    "yet this gives little information about the future , since many of them keep growing over time .",
    "thus it is desirable to set up models to fit real networks in both structure and functionality .",
    "we can use the models to mimic real - life networks .",
    "we also expect that the properties of the models can be proven rigorously , thus we can find the relations between topological and dynamical properties of networks .",
    "even if it is hard to give closed - formed expressions for some quantities , it would be nice to make them tractable for convenience of estimation .    among various network models ,",

    "it generates a random graph by choosing a constant probability for joining every pair of vertices in the network .",
    "the model exhibit interesting statistical properties and has been well studied by many people .",
    "however the model lacks some important properties of real - world networks .",
    "for example many real - world networks exhibit small - world property  @xcite with their diameters growing logarithmically in the number of vertices , while maintaining a high clustering coefficient . the watts - strogatz ( ws )",
    "model  @xcite is a typical graph model with the small - world effect . nevertheless ,",
    "because of its randomness , many of its properties can not be derived precisely , for example eigenvalues of the adjacency and laplacian matrices .",
    "thus deterministic models are often used to mimic complex networks  @xcite , since their structural  @xcite and spectral  @xcite characteristics can be determined analytically .",
    "in addition to the small - world effect , another important feature of a network is degree distribution .",
    "many real - world networks exhibit a heavy - tail distribution while some networks have an exponential distribution  @xcite .",
    "the famous preference attachment  @xcite scheme successfully described the growing process of networks with heavy - tailed degree distribution .",
    "this work , like the ws model  @xcite , leads to a network with an exponential degree distribution .",
    "recently graph ( matrix ) products have been applied to modelling graphs with the same properties as real - life networked systems , such as the cartesian product  @xcite , dot product  @xcite and kronecker product  @xcite .",
    "a merit of such methods is that the graph / matrix products facilitate estimate of the properties of the generated graphs .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a recursive way to generate small - world networks with an exponential degree distribution , based on corona product of graphs .",
    "we obtain exact solutions to many structural properties of the networks .",
    "moreover , we derive all the eigenvalues for their adjacency matrix and laplacian matrix , which are provided in a recursive way .",

    "in this section we derive several important quantities of the rcg , showing that it is an appropriate model for the small - world complex networks .",
    "thanks to the deterministic feature of @xmath16 , we can give exact expressions for the properties of the graph .",

    "therefore we can find @xmath58 for large @xmath14 we have @xmath59      one important parameter for the degree correlation is the average degree of adjacent vertices of all vertices which is referred to as any vertex with degree @xmath36 .",
    "we denote the parameter by @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath60 increases with @xmath36 , this means that the vertices have a tendency to connect to vertices with a similar or larger degree . in this case",

    "it leads to @xmath66 which yields @xmath67 by checking the results we can see that the considered graph is assortative .      given a graph @xmath68 , its _ average distance _ or _",

    "many works about determining clustering coefficient and its related quantities are done on both graph models and graphs in reality  @xcite .",
