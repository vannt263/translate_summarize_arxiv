    "localizing scalars and fermions in brane - world field theoretic models is conceptually straightforward @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gauge field localization is tricky .",
    "one either does not allow gauge fields to penetrate into the bulk @xcite , or has to deal with charge universality @xcite , i.  e. , the property that the effective 4d gauge coupling must be independent of the bulk wave function of a charged particle .",
    "the latter property implies that the gauge field zero mode is constant along extra dimensions ( unlike zero modes of scalars and fermions , which typically decay away from the brane ) .",
    "the independence of the gauge field zero mode of extra - dimensional coordinates may lead to infrared problems .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out in refs .",

    "[ figure1 ] , which diverges in 5d lineary with the size of extra dimension @xmath0 , provided that the effective mass of the charged field does not grow indefinitely away from the brane .",
    "this is easy to understand : suppose one keeps the size of the loop finite and moves it towards @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the extra coordinate .",
    "since the gauge field zero mode is constant in @xmath2 , and the effective mass of the charged field is constant at large @xmath2 , the loop contribution is independent of @xmath2 , and the integration over @xmath2 gives the volume of extra dimension .",
    "likewise , the one - loop correction to the 4d propagator of the gauge field boson in the zero mode state is also proportional to  @xmath0 .",
    "this observation , however , does not necessarily mean that a theory has unacceptable ir pathologies . indeed ,",
    "since the zero mode is strongly non - local along extra dimension , it can not be produced alone by a local source .",
    "the ir pathology is indeed likely to be there in models with a gap between the zero and higher modes in the gauge field sector @xcite : at low 4d momenta heavy states decouple , and the only relevant degree of freedom is the zero mode .",
    "however , the gap is absent in other models of gauge field localization , notably , generalizations @xcite of the rsii set up @xcite .",
    "arguments have been given some time ago @xcite , suggesting that models of the latter type may be free of ir pathologies .    in this paper",

    "is interested primarily in the processes with particles ( say , charged fermions ) residing on the brane , the object of particular relevance is the brane - to - brane gauge field propagator .",
