    "in a wave function approach to the study of an interacting quantum system we usually resort to some physical and numerical insights to suggest a reasonable variational wave function that approximates the quantum state of the system .",
    "in fact , providing a succinct representation that well describes the physical state of the system means we know how to model the relevant quantum correlations in an efficient way .",
    "the number of variational parameters we need to characterize such a wave function could be of the order of the size of system , depending on the nature of quantum correlations captured by the wave function .",
    "here it is essential to have an efficient optimization algorithm for minimizing the hamiltonian expectation over the space of the variational parameters .    in this work",
    "we will use some ideas from the physics of quantum many - body systems , more specifically the matrix product states  @xcite and the coupled cluster method  @xcite , to construct an ansatz of multilayer wave functions for a possibly disordered quantum system of interacting spins .",
    "the matrix product states and the related generalizations  @xcite , e.g. multiscale entanglement - renormalization  @xcite and projected entangled pair states  @xcite , can be constructed by integrating over some auxiliary degrees of freedom interconnected in a specific manner to the physical variables to account for the entanglement in different parts of the system  @xcite . on the other hand , in the coupled cluster method one",
    "starts from an appropriate reference state , e.g. the hartree - fock wave function , and elaborates on the local excitations to obtain more accurate wave functions and estimations for the ground - state energy  @xcite .",
    "it is always useful in the study of interacting systems to start with the mean - field ( mf ) wave functions ( or product states ) .",
    "more accurate wave functions are obtained by adding interactions between the variables  @xcite . here ,",
    "in general , we have to resort to some approximation algorithms , e.g. monte carlo  @xcite , to compute efficiently the quantum expectations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we proposed to estimate the expectations within the bethe approximation , which allows us to write the hamiltonian expectation in terms of some local functions of the variational parameters and the cavity marginals of the bethe approximation ; for a review of similar methods see  @xcite .",
    "note that the bethe estimation of the hamiltonian expectation is not necessarily an upper bound for the ground - state energy , unless the interaction graph defined by the trial wave function has a tree structure .",
    "nevertheless , the same approximation offers efficient message - passing algorithms that have been proved useful in the study of random constraint satisfaction and optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "symmetric wave functions with a tree structure provide us with another category of computationally tractable states which somehow complement the mean - field states ; while the latter wave functions are good candidates for the state of the system in the ordered ( ferromagnetic , or localized ) phase , the symmetric states are more appropriate in the disordered ( paramagnetic , or extended ) phase . moreover , in both the cases we can easily construct an orthonormal set of locally excited states that could be useful in the framework of the coupled cluster method  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the weighted graph states studied in quantum physics and information theory can be represented by application of some two - body unitary operators on initially mean - field states  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can obtain a weighted graph state with an initially tree wave function and still compute efficiently the quantum expectation of local observables .",
    "in this study we use the mean - field and the symmetric tree wave functions to construct an ansatz of multilayer wave functions by a recursive coupling of the local excitations ; we start from a reference wave function and in each step we construct a higher - level wave function by taking a superposition of the locally `` excited states '' obtained from the wave function in the previous step . in the last step",
    "we minimize the hamiltonian expectation with respect to the variational parameters characterizing the reference state and the superposition functions .",
    "note that we use the `` excited state '' for any state that is orthogonal to the trail wave function ; in this sense , the average energy of an excited state could be less than that of the reference wave function as we minimize the energy over the whole set of the parameters only in the end of the process .",
    "the simple structure of the wave functions allows us to work with local energy functions of the variational parameters which is essential for utilizing distributed message - passing algorithms in the study of the optimization problem . in principle",
    ", the method can be implemented with more general wave functions for spin systems with an arbitrary interaction graph .    in the following",
    "we will specify the wave functions and the local excitations that we are going to work with in the multilayer wave functions .",

    "<S> finding a succinct representation to describe the ground state of a disordered interacting system could be very helpful in understanding the interplay between the interactions that is manifested in a quantum phase transition . in this work we use some elementary states to construct recursively an ansatz of multilayer wave functions , where in each step the higher - level wave function is represented by a superposition of the locally `` excited states '' obtained from the lower - level wave function . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to write the hamiltonian expectation in terms of some local functions of the variational parameters , and employ an efficient message - passing algorithm to find the optimal parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain good estimations of the ground - state energy and the phase transition point for the transverse ising model with a few layers of mean - field and symmetric tree states . </S>",
    "<S> the work is the first step towards the application of local and distributed message - passing algorithms in the study of structured variational problems in finite dimensions . </S>"
