    "since the mid nineties of the last century high precision radial - velocity studies revealed more than 200 exoplanet candidates around mostly solar - like stars .",
    "these planet host stars are located in the solar neighborhood and are mostly isolated single stars .",
    "however , already among the first reported planet detections , three planets were found to orbit the brighter component of binary systems , namely 55cncab , @xmath2andab and @xmath3booab ( butler et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "since that time more and more planet host multiple star systems were identified , most of them being found in multiplicity studies of the planet host stars .",

    "in addition , data from visible and infrared all sky surveys like poss or 2mass are used to identify new companions of planet host stars ( see e.g. bakos et al . 2006 or raghavan et al . 2006 ) .",
    "because of all these efforts , more than 30 planet host multiple star systems are known today , suggesting that the multiplicity of planet host stars is at least 20% .",
    "most of the detected stellar companions to planet host stars are low - mass main sequence stars .",
    "the projected separations of these companions to the planet host stars range from only a few tens of au up to more than 5000au . in a few cases the companions themselves turned out to be close binaries ,",
    "i.e. these systems are hierarchical triples ( see mugrauer et al .",
    "2007 for a summary ) .",
    "not only main - sequence stars but also white dwarfs were revealed as companions of exoplanet host stars , suggesting that planetary systems also exist in evolved multiple star systems .",

    "for correction of telluric features and for the flux - calibration we observed the telluric standard hip15188 ( b3v ) .",
    "the reduced h- and k - band spectra of hd16141b are shown in fig.[hspec ] and fig.[kspec ] .",
    "the continua of the h- and k - band spectra as well as all detected atomic and molecular absorption features are consistent with a spectral type in the range m2v to m3v , i.e. hd16141b is a low mass stellar object as it was already expected from its photometry , adopting the distance of the planet host star for its companion .",
    "as described in the last two sections we can confirm the companionship of hd65216b and hd101930b detected first by astrometry as co - moving objects to the planet host stars hd65216a and hd101930a , with photometry and spectroscopy .",

    "besides our sofi h - band observations the hd65216 system was also observed with the adaptive optics system naco at ut4 ( yepun ) at paranal observatory .",
    "we retrieved public data from the eso archive obtained with the s27 camera ( pixel scale : 27.15mas per pixel and 28arcsec@xmath2628arcsec field of view ) of naco in december 2002 and december 2005 . in the first observing run 28 frames ,",

    "the images were flat - fielded and combined using the data reduction package _ eclipse _ ( devillard 2001 ) . at the position of hd65216b two objects",
    "are detected which are shown in fig.[nacopics ] for both naco observing epochs .",
    "the brighter source b is separated by only @xmath61mas from the fainter object c in the first epoch naco image from december 2002 ( they could also be called ba and bb , but we prefer b and c ) . in the second epoch",
    "naco image both sources are separated by only @xmath62mas , i.e. the separation significantly decreased by @xmath63mas .",
    "if we assume that the brighter component b follows the proper motion of the planet host star but the faint source c is just a non - moving background source , the expected change of separation should be much larger , namely @xmath64mas ( 15.6 naco s27-pixels ) for the given epoch difference between both naco observation runs .",
    "this expected change of separation is about ten times larger than the one we measured .",
    "hence , we conclude that b and c are co - moving objects , i.e. the hd65216 system is a hierarchical triple system composed of the planet host star hd65216a which is orbited by the close binary system hd65216bc at a wide separation ( 253au ) and by a planet candidate at close separation ( 1.37au ) .    the measured change of the separation between the b and c components can be explained by orbital motion of the b and c components around their common center of mass . in order to estimate this orbital motion we have to determine first the masses of both components .    in the second epoch narrow band",
    "naco images all three components of the hd65216 system are detected within the linearity limit of the naco detector .",
    "we determine a magnitude difference of @xmath65mag and @xmath66mag . with",
    "the given 2mass @xmath67-band magnitude of hd65216a we can approximate the @xmath67-band magnitudes of hd65216b and c and obtain @xmath68mag and @xmath69mag . with the known distance of the planet host star",
    "this finally yields the absolute @xmath67-band magnitudes of the two components @xmath70mag and @xmath71mag .    according to the spectral type ",
    "magnitude relation from cruz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) these values are consistent with low - mass objects of spectral type m7 to m8 for hd65216b and l2 to l3 for hd65216c .",
    "the absolute h - band magnitude of a m7 to m8 dwarf is @xmath72mag and @xmath73mag for objects of spectral types between l2 to l3 .",
    "the same result is obtained by an independent analysis of the same public naco datasets done by a. eggenberger ( private communication ) , see eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "hence , the total magnitude of the unresolved hd65216bc system should be @xmath74mag , which corresponds to an apparent magnitude of @xmath75mag at the distance of the planet host star .",
    "it is worth to mention that the sofi h - band photometry of the unresolved pair hd65216bc @xmath40mag is fully consistent with the derived magnitude estimate .",
    "if we assume a system age of 5gyr we can use again the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models to derive the masses of both components .",
    "we obtain @xmath76 for hd65216b and @xmath77 for hd65216c , respectively ( since the system is older according to its metallicity , the true masses may be slightly larger ) .",
    "hence the total mass of hd65216bc is 0.167@xmath78 .",
    "the average separation of both components is 167mas , which corresponds to a projected separation of 6au at the distance of the planet host star .",
    "we can use this separation as estimate for the semi - major axis of the system and finally derive its orbital period using kepler s third law , which yields 36 years .",
    "the maximal expected change of separation between both components is 19mas / yr . thus , for an epoch difference of three years the expected maximal change of separation due to orbital motion should be smaller than 57mas .",
    "indeed , the measured change of separation between hd65216b and c ( @xmath63mas ) can be explained with orbital motion of both objects around their barycenter .",
    "this relatively short orbital motion is important , because it will yield directly determined masses from astrometry and kepler s third law within a few decades , which are very rare at such late spectral types and low masses , hence will be very useful for calibrating models and to constrain the mass - luminosity relation at the low - mass end .",
    "finally , we can determine the radius of the longterm stable region around the planet host star , using again the approximation of holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) and the derived masses of hd65216b and c ( total mass 0.167@xmath78 ) , the mass of the planet host star ( 0.94@xmath78 ) as well as the projected separation between the star and its binary companion ( 253au ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath79au for an assumed eccentric orbit of hd65216bc with @xmath56 and @xmath80 for a circular orbit , respectively .",
    "we would like to thank the technical staff of the eso ntt for all help and assistance in carrying out the observations .",

    "<S> we present new results from our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host stars , carried out with the infrared camera sofi at eso - ntt . </S>",

    "<S> hd101930ab is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star hd101930a and its companion hd101930b which is a m0 to m1 dwarf with a mass of about 0.7@xmath0 separated from the primary by @xmath173arcsec ( 2200au projected separation ) . </S>",
    "<S> hd65216 forms a hierarchical triple system , with a projected separation of 253au ( angular separation of about 7arcsec ) between the planet host star hd65216a and its close binary companion hd65216bc , whose two components are separated by only @xmath10.17arcsec ( 6au of projected separation ) . </S>",
    "<S> two vlt - naco images separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co - moving to the planet host star . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared photometry of hd65216b and c is consistent with a m7 to m8 ( 0.089@xmath0 ) , and a l2 to l3 dwarf ( 0.078@xmath0 ) , respectively , both close to the sub - stellar limit . </S>",
    "<S> an infrared spectrum with vlt - isaac of the pair hd65216bc , even though not resolved spatially , confirms this late spectral type . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present h- and k - band isaac infrared spectra of hd16141b , the recently detected co - moving companion of the planet host star hd16141a . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of hd16141b are both fully consistent with a m2 to m3 dwarf located at the distance of the planet host star .    </S>",
