    "popov exact solutions of the equations for the spherically symmetric perturbations of the ultrarelativistic friedmann world with an arbitrary curve index [ 4 ] were obtained .",
    "however , the analysis of the obtained solutions and the calculation of the average quadrature corrections to the friedmann metrics were not fulfilled . in connection with the problem of dark energy and dark materia in cosmology",
    "the task of possible alteration of macroscopic equation of state of the friedmann universe by the local gravitational interactions becomes actual , as far as the potential energy on the gravitational interactions is negative , it can correspond to a negative macroscopic pressure . in the present work",
    "we start investigating this possibility by fulfilling subsequent maintaining a dynamic theory of the friedmann universe subject to the local gravitational perturbations .",
