    "ongoing doppler planet searches have discovered more than 200 extrasolar planets with various characteristics .",
    "most of them are quite different from those in our solar - system : the planets have minimum masses of 5 @xmath615 @xmath3 and are distributed in the range of orbital radii from 0.02 to 6 au with orbital eccentricities of 00.9 ( e.g. butler et al .",
    "2006 ) . distribution and correlation between these parameters",
    "are now used to calibrate planet formation theories by comparing with predictions from numerical simulations taking account of key processes of planet formation such as migration , disk lifetime , and variation of disk mass ( ida & lin 2004 ; alibert et al . 2005 ) .",
    "properties of host stars also play an important role to constrain planet formation mechanisms .",
    "for example , frequency of planets is well correlated with metallicity of the host stars : metal - rich stars tend to harbor more planets than metal - poor ones do ( fischer & valenti 2005 ; santos et al . 2005 ) , which supports the core - accretion scenario for the mechanism of giant planet formation . the host stars mass can be another essential parameter .",
    "recently , johnson et al . ( 2007a ) showed that frequency of planets around stars with @xmath7 is as high as about 9% , compared to about 4% for solar - mass ( @xmath8 ) stars and about 2% for low - mass ( @xmath9 ) k  m stars .",
    "it suggests that giant planets are more abundant in more massive stars probably because of their larger surface density of dust in proto - planetary disks ( ida & lin 2005 ; laughlin et al .",
    "however , in higher - mass stars such as b  a dwarfs ( @xmath10 ) , the shorter lifetime of the disk and the paucity of solid materials close to the central star could reduce the abundance of giant planets as a whole .",
    "the frequency of planets around such massive stars has not been established yet .",
    "doppler planet searches around intermediate - mass ( @xmath11 ) stars have gradually expanded during these five years . since massive stars on the main - sequence ( early - type stars )",
    "are unsuitable for precise radial velocity measurements due to few absorption lines in their spectra , which are often rotationally broadened , major teams have targeted cool and slowly - rotating g and k giants and subgiants , that is , massive stars in evolved stages ( setiawan et al .",

    "they have succeeded in discovering 12 substellar companions so far around stars with masses of 1.63.9@xmath5 including clump giants and subgiants , and about a half of the host stars have masses greater than 2@xmath5 .",
    "although the number of planets is still small , the planets begin to show different properties from those around low - mass stars : high frequency of massive planets ( lovis & mayor 2007 ) , lack of inner planets ( johnson et al . 2007b ) , and low metallicity of host stars ( pasquini et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these properties must reflect the history of formation and evolution of planetary systems , which are not necessarily the same as those for solar - type stars .",
    "planets around low - mass ( @xmath12 ) giants have been also discovered from precise radial velocity surveys ( frink et al . 2002 ; setiawan et al . 2003 ; setiawan 2003 ; hatzes et al . 2003 ; d@xmath13llinger et al .",

    ", we extracted two stellar templates from several star+i@xmath14 spectra at the peak and valley phases of observed radial velocities for each star .",
    "then , cross correlation profiles of the two templates were calculated for 3050 spectral segments ( 45@xmath15 width each ) in which severely blended lines or broad lines were not included .",
    "three bisector quantities were calculated for the cross correlation profile of each segment : the velocity span ( bvs ) , which is the velocity difference between two flux levels of the bisector ; the velocity curvature ( bvc ) , which is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half and lower half of the bisector ; and the velocity displacement ( bvd ) , which is the average of the bisector at three different flux levels .",
    "we used flux levels of 25% , 50% , and 75% of the cross correlation profile to calculate the above quantities .",
    "resulting bisector quantities for 18 del , @xmath0 aql , hd 81688 , and hd 104985 are listed in table [ tbl - bisector ] . as expected from the planetary hypothesis , both of the bvs and the bvc are identical to zero , which means that the cross correlation profiles are symmetric , and the average bvd is consistent with the velocity difference between the two templates at the peak and valley phases of observed radial velocities ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the bvs for hd 104985 is slightly large compared to those for other stars , suggesting the higher intrinsic variability for hd 104985",

    "however , the bvs value is only one thirtieth of the bvd and thus it is unlikely that the observed radial velocity variations are produced by the intrinsic activity such as pulsation or rotational modulation .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the radial velocity variability observed in these 4 stars are best explained by orbital motion .",
    "we discovered a total of 6 substellar companions around g and k giants so far from our okayama planet search program ( sato et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ; liu et al . 2007 ; this work ) .",

    "when we include 6 more planets discovered around possible clump giants by other teams ( table [ tbl - pllist ] ) , the mass of the host stars ranges from 1.7 to 3.9 @xmath5 .",
    "these discoveries definitely indicate that planets can form around intermediate - mass stars , such as b  a dwarfs , as well as around low - mass ones .",
    "the extended sample enables us to clarify the properties of the planets around intermediate - mass clump giants ; the planets have minimum masses of 2.319.8@xmath3 , semimajor axes of 0.682.6 au , and eccentricities of 00.4 . in figure",
    "[ fig - avsm ] , we plotted the minimum mass against the semimajor axis . since intrinsic variability in radial velocity of clump giants is typically 1020 m s@xmath20 ( sato et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is normally difficult to detect planets with @xmath107 at @xmath221 au around a 2@xmath5 star , which can produce radial velocity semiamplitude of 40 m s@xmath20 at most .",
    "such lower - mass planets can be detected around stars with small intrinsic variability ( @xmath10810 m s@xmath20 ) like subgiants ( johnson et al .",
    "while the largest semimajor axis of 2.6 au is limited by the time baseline of the current surveys , the lack of short - period planets with @xmath1090.7 au appears to be real at least for relatively massive planets because stellar radius of clump giants is typically 1020@xmath110 , which correspond to 0.050.1 au , and thus we should be able to find planets with 0.1@xmath1110.7 au if they exist . in figure [ fig - avse ] , we plotted the eccentricity against the semimajor axis together with lines expressing different periastron distances ( @xmath112 ) . from the view point of orbital evolution of planets ,",
    "periastron distance is more essential rather than semimajor axis because tidal interaction between a planet and a central star strongly depends on distance between them .",
    "as shown in the figure , all the companions around clump giants have @xmath113 au , while those around intermediate - mass subgiants ( 1.61.9@xmath5 ) and low - mass k giants ( @xmath12 ) have @xmath114 au and @xmath115 au , respectively .",
    "since a lot of planets with @xmath1160.3 au have been found around solar - type dwarfs ( open circles ) , the lack of inner planets around low - mass k giants can be due to engulfment by the central stars .",
    "we here examined whether the lack of short - period planets around clump giants could be reproduced by evolutionary effect of the central stars based on available stellar evolutionary models .",
    "if the clump giants are post - rgb ( core helium burning ) stars , short - period planets around them might have been engulfed by the central stars at the tip of rgb due to tidal torque from the expanding stellar surface .",
    "we numerically traced tidal evolution of a planetary orbit ( @xmath117 ) based on equations from zahn ( 1989 ) and stellar evolutionary tracks from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) ( ls01 ) and claret ( 2004,2006,2007 ) .",
    "we assumed a circular orbit but the result can be applied to the case of an eccentric orbit by replacing the semimajor axis with periastron distance .",
    "we also took account of orbital evolution due to mass loss as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a mass of the central star .",
    "mass loss of the central star makes planets move outward because of their weakened gravitational pull on the planets ( e.g. , sackmann et al . 1993 ; duncan & lissauer 1998 ) .",
    "thus , net change of orbital radius of a planet is expressed as @xmath120 .",
    "we finally found out , however , that orbital change due to mass loss is negligible in rgb phase for planets around 23 @xmath5 stars because the mass loss of those stars in rgb phase is negligible based on the adopted evolutionary tracks .",
    "it excludes the scenario that inner planets were pushed out to 0.7 au resulting in the lack of planets within the radius .",
    "the mass loss may be important in the case of lower - mass stars ( silvotti et al . 2007 ) . from the orbital calculations",
    ", we found out that jupiter - mass planets within about 34 @xmath121 ( radius of a central star ) can be engulfed by the central stars due to the tidal torque during rgb phase .",
    "our results predict that , around 23 @xmath5 stars , only planets within 0.2 au are engulfed by the central stars at the bottom of rgb ( @xmath122 ) , but those within about 0.5 au can be done at the tip of rgb ( @xmath123 ) . the critical orbital radius at the tip of rgb for 2@xmath5 can be larger than 1 au in the cases of @xmath124 for ls01 and @xmath125 and 0.04 for claret s tracks .",
    "when we assume that most of the clump giants are post - rgb stars , it might be natural that we could not find short - period planets around them even if they had originally existed .",
    "typically small orbital eccentricities ( @xmath126 ) of the planets discovered around clump giants compared to those around dwarfs may favor this scenario , in which the planetary orbits could be tidally circularized during rgb phase",
    ".    there can be another possibility , however , that short - period planets are primordially rare around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "lack of short - period planets around less evolved subgiants with 1.61.9@xmath5 ( figure [ fig - avse ] ; johnson et al .",
    "2007b ) , which are considered to be first ascent on rgb , may favor this scenario .",
    "such dependence of orbital distribution of planets on host star s mass is predicted by burkert & ida ( 2007 ) .",
    "they pointed out that in observed data for f ",
    "k dwarfs , there may be a paucity of planets in @xmath1270.10.6 au around @xmath128 stars ( f dwarfs ) while the semimajor axis distribution is more uniform around g and k dwarfs .",
    "they showed that the gap could be produced by shorter viscous diffusion timescale of disks possibly due to smaller disk size for more massive stars , which can limit the efficiency of type ii migration of giant planets and keep planets residing close to initial formation locations beyond snow lines at several au .",
    "the lack of inner planets around subgiants with 1.61.9@xmath5 might be consistent with this prediction .",
    "it is not clear whether this is also the case for more massive stars with @xmath129 . around such stars , due to distant snow line ( @xmath13010 au ) and averagely large disk mass ,",
    "the main region for giant planet formation could be closer to the central stars compared to around low - mass stars .",
    "on the other hand , kennedy and kenyon ( 2007 ) recently showed that the snow line distance changes weakly with stellar mass if they take account of disk and pre - main - sequence evolution .",
    "more detailed theoretical modeling is required for planet formation around stars with @xmath129 .    in order to further investigate formation and evolution of planetary systems around massive stars via evolved giants , it is important to derive their accurate mass and evolutionary status .",
    "it is normally difficult , however , because stars with different mass and evolutionary status can occupy similar position in the giant branch on the hr diagram . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", asteroseismology will be a powerful tool , which can probe stellar interior by using tiny stellar oscillations .",
    "such oscillations were actually detected in some g and k giants ( e.g. , frandsen et al .",
