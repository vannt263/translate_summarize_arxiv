    "at a sufficiently high temperature qcd is known to undergo a phase transition from our everyday phase , where quarks and gluons are confined , to a deconfined quark - gluon plasma . since",
    "the early days of lattice gauge theory simulations of this transition have been a subject of the field @xcite , see @xcite for reviews . naturally , such simulations focused on boundary conditions ( bcs ) , which are favorable for reaching the infinite volume quantum @xcite continuum limit quickly . on lattices of size",
    "@xmath0 these are periodic bcs in the spatial volume @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lattice spacing . for a textbook , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the physical temperature of the system on a @xmath0 lattice , @xmath3 , is given by @xmath4 where @xmath2 is the lattice spacing . in this paper",
    "we set the physical scale by @xcite , @xmath5 for the deconfinement temperature , which is approximately the average from qcd estimates with two light flavor quarks @xcite in the infinite volume extrapolation .",
    "the relation ( [ lgt_t ] ) implies for the temporal extension of the system @xmath6 for the deconfinement phase created in a rhic the infinite volume limit @xmath7 for fixed @xmath8 and subsequently @xmath9 ( @xmath10 finite ) does not apply . instead we have to take the continuum limit as @xmath11 and periodic bcs are incorrect because the outside is in the confined phase at low temperature .",
    "details are discussed in the next section .    in collisions at the bnl",
    "rhic @xcite one expects to create an ensemble of differently shaped and sized volumes , which contain the deconfined quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the largest volumes are those encountered in central collisions .",
    "a rough estimate of their size is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the speed of light . to imitate this geometry",
    ", one may want to model spatial volumes of cylindrical and other geometries . in our exploratory study",
    "we do not try to imitate a realistic ensemble of deconfined volumes , but are content to estimate the magnitude of corrections one may expect .",
    "so we stay with @xmath14 volumes and focus on results in the continuum limit for @xmath15 finite volume corrections to the infinite volume continuum limit are expected to be relevant as long as the volume is not large compared to a typical hadronic correlation length , which is about one fermi .",
    "for relatively small volumes an appropriate modeling of the bcs is necessary .    in the next section",
    "we introduce bcs , which reflect a ( very ) low temperature outside of the deconfined region .",
    "two constructions , the `` disorder wall '' and the `` confinement wall '' are carried out and shown to exhibit the usual asymptotic scaling properties in the finite volume continuum limit . while the confined wall is physically more accurate , the disorder wall can be easily implemented in mc calculations . for the latter mc calculations of pure su(3 ) lgt are performed in section  [ su3_mc ] and evidence for scaling is already found for systems sizes which can be simulated on pc clusters .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in section  [ sec_sum ] .",
    "statistical properties of a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath16 in a continuum volume @xmath17 , which is in equilibrium with a heatbath at physical temperature @xmath18 , are determined by the partition function @xcite @xmath19 where the sum extends over all possible states @xmath20 of the system and the boltzmann constant is set to one .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions in euclidean time @xmath21 and bounds of integration from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , one can rewrite the partition function ( [ e : z ] ) in the path integral representation : @xmath24 nothing in this formulation requires to carry out the infinite volume limit . in the contrary , if one deals with rather small volumes for which fluctuations of the mean values are not negligible , the idea to consider @xmath25 instead of @xmath17 appears to be rather obscure .",
    "an obvious problem of applying equilibrium thermodynamics to deconfined volumes at rhic is that there is no heatbath in sight with which the system could be in equilibrium .",
    "however , arguments have been made in the literature that after the rapid heating quench , when the deconfined volume is at about its maximum size , a ( pseudo ) equilibrium state is reached for a transitional period , which is reasonably long on the scale of the relaxation times involved .",
    "these arguments are not beyond doubts ( some are raised in one of our own papers @xcite ) , but they are not a topic of our present work . here",
    "our assumption is that there is some truth to the belief that the bulk properties can be described by equilibrated finite temperature qcd .    in mc simulation",
    "the updating process provides the heatbath and finite volumes can be equilibrated with all kind of bcs imposed , although in practice most simulations have used periodic bcs . for simplicity and to be definite we restrict our discussion to pure su(3 ) lgt .",
    "generalization of the arguments of this section to full qcd appears to be straightforward .",
    "we use the wilson action given by @xmath26 @xmath27 , where the sum is over all plaquettes of a 4d simple hypercubic lattice , @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the sites circulating about the plaquette and @xmath30 is the @xmath31 matrix associated with the link @xmath32 .",
    "the reversed link is associated with the inverse matrix , and @xmath33 is related to the bare coupling constant by @xmath34 .",
    "the theory is defined by the expectation values of its operators with respect to the euclidean path integral @xmath35 where the integrations are over the invariant group measure , which was for compact groups like su(3 ) introduced by hurwitz @xcite ( haar @xcite generalized it later ) .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that for @xmath8 fixed and @xmath36 su(3 ) lattice gauge theory exhibits a deconfining phase transition ( sub- or superscript @xmath37 stand for transition ) at some coupling @xmath38 , which is weakly first order  @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior of the deconfining temperature is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant and we use the lambda lattice scale @xmath41 where @xmath2 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are perturbatively determined by the renormalization group equation and independent of the renormalization prescription @xcite , @xmath44 for perturbative and non - perturbative corrections we adopt the analysis of @xcite in the parameterization of @xcite : @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we want to model an equilibrium situation surrounded by cold boundaries at @xmath50k .",
    "the effects are expected to penetrate at least a few correlation lengths into the volume .",
    "note that this is the correlation length set by hadronic interaction , which can be defined by an appropriate inverse mass . on the lattice",
    "@xmath51 governs the continuum limit .",
    "this should not be confused with correlations due to the phase transition . as the lattice regularization allows to construct finite volume continuum limits as well as the infinite volume continuum limit",
    ", the question is : which construction has the best chances to capture the physics realistically for a quark - gluon plasma in a small volume as typically created at rhic ?",
    "let us first exemplify that lgt thermodynamics allows not only to approach the infinite volume continuum limit , but also finite volume continuum limits .",
    "for instance , we can define the thermodynamics on a torus which has the volume of , say , @xmath52 . to achieve a continuum limit",
    ", we have to send the lattice spacing @xmath53 in units of the physical scale .",
    "this is governed by the renormalization group equation and requires infinitely many lattice points @xmath54 , while the physical volume of the lattice stays finite by arranging @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant , e.g. , @xmath57 .",
    "the temperature of such a system is regulated by choosing @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a second constant . for describing deconfined volumes at rhic the thus defined toroidal",
    "mini - universe is even less suitable than the conventionally used infinite volume limit , because correlations are artificially propagated through the periodic bcs .",
    "we present now two constructions of bcs , which reflect cold exterior volumes .",
    "the second is physically more realistic , but numerically more difficult to implement .",
    "imagine an almost infinite space volume @xmath60 , which may have periodic bcs , and a smaller ( very large , but small compared to @xmath17 ) sub - volume @xmath61 .",
    "the complement to @xmath62 in @xmath17 will be called @xmath63 .",
    "the number of temporal lattice links @xmath8 is the same for both volumes .",
    "we want to find @xmath33 values and lattice dimensions so that scaling holds , while @xmath62 is at a temperature of @xmath64 and @xmath63 at @xmath65 .",
    "we set the coupling @xmath33 to @xmath66 for plaquettes in @xmath62 and to @xmath67 for plaquettes in @xmath63 .",
    "for that purpose any plaquette touching a site in @xmath63 is considered to be in @xmath63 .",
    "let us take @xmath68 , which is at the beginning of the su(3 ) scaling region .",
    "we have @xmath69 and , therefore , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the lattice spacing in @xmath72 . using ( [ lambda ] ) the scaling equation @xmath73 yields @xmath74 . @xmath75 estimates from mc calculations of the literature extrapolate then to @xmath76 for the temporal lattice extension needed for a deconfined phase at @xmath77 .",
    "this illustrates the orders of magnitude involved .",
    "so , in practice we can only have @xmath66 , but not @xmath67 in the scaling region , say @xmath78 .",
    "there is still a reasonable choice for @xmath67 .",
    "the scaling argument ( [ e : tratio ] ) shows that in lattice units a correlation length @xmath79 , say one fermi , is at @xmath66 much larger than at @xmath67 : @xmath80 now @xmath81 is of order one at @xmath78 , so that @xmath82 becomes very small and the lowest order of the strong coupling expansion applies ( see @xcite for the string tension and @xcite for the glueball mass ) in which @xmath83 so that @xmath84 .",
    "we call this construction the disorder wall .",
    "the disorder wall allows for a finite volume continuum limit , which is approached for @xmath85 , and the usual scaling law holds .",
    "eventually ( obviously for @xmath86 ) the value of @xmath67 increases also , unless the outside temperature is exactly zero and , hence , @xmath87 .",
    "an outside temperature of 300@xmath88k is on the scale of the inside temperature so close to zero that in practical mc simulations the effects of the @xmath67 increase are not noticeable and @xmath87 is a safe choice independently of @xmath66 .",
    "simulation results in section  [ su3_mc ] support that scaling in @xmath66 holds already for @xmath66 values , which can be reached in practice .      in the continuum limit",
    "the disorder wall separates regions in which a correlation length @xmath79 takes on entirely different magnitudes when measured in unit of the lattice spacing ( [ e : xirat ] ) .",
    "although we are only interested in the physics inside the wall , a construction for which the distance of one fermi stays in lattice units continuous across the boundary is clearly more physical . along similar lines as before this can be achieved by using an anisotropic lattice outside of the deconfined region .",
    "let us denote in @xmath63 the spacelike links by @xmath89 , the timelike links by @xmath90 , and use there the wilson action @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the couplings of the spacelike and timelike plaquettes , respectively .",
    "the lambda scale of this action has been investigated by karsch @xcite and in the continuum one finds  @xcite @xmath94 as we aim at @xmath95 the resulting orders of magnitude are even more astronomical than before .",
    "the sublattice @xmath63 is again driven out of the scaling region , which would be reached for sufficiently large values of @xmath96 . for all practical purposes",
    "we are driven into the strong coupling region and can set @xmath97 , so that the simulation of the confined world becomes effectively 3d . by measuring an appropriate correlation length , for instance via the string tension or glueball mass , we can non - perturbatively tune @xmath92 , so that @xmath98 holds .",
    "a mc simulation has then to include an outside world with a non - zero @xmath92 .",
    "this is physically quite interesting , but computationally more demanding than using the disorder wall , for which we present mc simulations in the following .",
    "in the monte carlo calculations of this section we approximate a cold exterior by using the disorder wall bcs . in practice",
    "this means , we simply omit plaquettes , which involve links through the boundary .",
    "so we drop the subscript in the @xmath66 definition of the previous section and return to simply using the @xmath33 notation . for both periodic and disorder wall",
    "bcs we present an analysis of data from simulations on @xmath99 lattices with @xmath100 and  6 .",
    "the @xmath101 values and our statistics in sweeps are compiled in tables  [ tab_4stat ] and  [ tab_6stat ] .    as in @xcite",
    "we use the maxima of the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath102_{\\max},\\,\\,\\,p=\\sum_{\\vec{x}}p_{\\vec{x}}\\ ] ] to define pseudo - transition couplings @xmath103 . for periodic bcs ,",
    "indicated by the superscript @xmath104 of @xmath105 , they have a finite size behavior of the form @xmath106 fits to this form yield @xmath107 and estimates are given in boyd et al .",
    "our estimates for @xmath108 are summarized in table  [ tab_4stat ] . within statistical errors",
    "the lattice size dependence of @xmath108 is almost negligible",
    ". a fit of our data with periodic bcs to ( [ beta_pbc ] ) gives @xmath109 in agreement with the value @xmath110 reported in @xcite .",
    "from now on we use @xmath109 as the infinite volume limit for periodic and disorder wall bcs .",
    ".number of measurements and pseudo - transition coupling estimates for @xmath111 lattices . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now consider the width of the transition .",
    "for a @xmath112 lattice with disorder wall bcs the polyakov loop susceptibility as a function of @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chi_4x16 ] .",
    "we use reweighting @xcite to cover a range of @xmath33 and define @xmath113 as the width of a peak at @xmath114 of its height . on large lattices",
    "the figures look less nice than fig .",
    "[ fig_chi_4x16 ] , but provide still sufficient information to extract @xmath113 .",
    "our estimates for @xmath100 are listed in table  [ tab_4dbeta ] and for @xmath115 in table  [ tab_6dbeta ] .",
    "the data are fitted to the form @xmath116 for periodic bcs and to @xmath117 for the disorder wall bcs .",
    "the first term reflects in both cases the delta function singularity of a first order phase transition .",
    "the leading order corrections to that differ due to the influence of the bcs .    for @xmath100 the final fits ( see below )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4dbeta ] . from the disorder wall data",
    "we have omitted our smallest @xmath118 lattice from the fit , because the width becomes for it so broad that it spoils @xmath119 ( larger lattices than with periodic bcs are needed ) .",
    "the leading order coefficients are then @xmath120 and @xmath121 . both data sets",
    "together can still be consistently fitted using the weighted average @xmath122 of the leading order coefficients and 1-parameter fits for @xmath59 in ( [ dbeta_pbcfit ] ) and ( [ dbeta_cbcfit ] ) .",
    "this ensures that the ratio of the widths becomes one in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in contrast to the polyakov loop maxima , the width of the transition is a physical observable , which is to leading order in the volume independent of the bcs .",
    "we have chosen to show these 1-parameter fits together with their @xmath119 values in fig .",
    "[ fig_4dbeta ] .",
    "the methodology for the corresponding @xmath115 fits is the same as before . using the data of table  [ tab_6dbeta ] we find the leading order coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which average to @xmath125 . with this values",
    "consistent 1-parameter fits are obtained and together with their @xmath119 values depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_6dbeta ] .",
    "note that the ordinate scale in this figure is more than three times larger than in fig .",
    "[ fig_4dbeta ]",
    ". nevertheless the extracted physical values have to be the same to the extent that scaling holds .",
    "we want to plot the width in physical units of mev versus the box size in fermi and follow a similar procedure as before for @xmath126 . for given @xmath127",
    "we define @xmath128 the dependence @xmath129 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dtc ] . compared to periodic bcs disorder wall bcs lead to a substantial broadening of the transition for the volumes",
    "considered : at @xmath52 by a factor of 4.3 and at @xmath130 by a factor of 5.5 .",
    "the width is slightly less than 1% of the ( enhanced ) transition temperature at @xmath52 and about 8% at @xmath130 . within the error bars , which are quite large for the widths , scaling works again well .",
    "simulations with disorder wall bcs have turned out to be far more cpu time consuming than those with periodic bcs .",
    "the decreased heights of our pseudo - transition signals ( the maxima of the polyakov loop susceptibilities ) , their increased widths and the strong finite size effects are the underlying reasons . while the reweighting range @xcite is about the same for simulations with periodic or disorder wall bcs on identically sized lattices , accurate disorder wall results require far more patches , i.e. , independent simulations at distinct @xmath33 values .",
    "in addition the signal is worse due to the decreased heights of the peaks .",
    "finally extrapolations to infinite lattices , as needed for the finite volume continuum limit , are more demanding due to the strong and more sophisticated finite size corrections .",
    "this is helped by including infinite volume extrapolations from periodic lattices as disorder wall data points , what can be done because these extrapolations do not depend on the bcs .",
    "still , data from our largest @xmath131 lattice turn out to be essential to stabilize the @xmath115 fits for large lattice sizes .",
    "far smaller lattices are sufficient when periodic bcs are used .",
    "relatively small physical volumes as typical for the deconfined phase in bnl rhic @xcite lead in our su(3 ) investigation to a substantial rounding of the transition and to an increase of the ( effective ) deconfinement temperature by 5% to 20% .",
    "the physical reason for these corrections is that correlation lengths are proportional to @xmath132 and @xmath133 does not approach zero in the finite volume continuum limit .",
    "we estimate that the corrections are negligible for the geometry of a torus , used in practically all previous lgt simulations of the subject , but not for bcs which reflect the cold exterior . using the disorder wall bcs introduced in section  [ sub_dwall ]",
    ", we find the magnitude of the effects on pure su(3 ) lgt competitive to those of other corrections , foremost the inclusion of quarks .",
    "in particular the width of the transition increases by factors 4 to 6 over the width found for a torus of the same physical size .",
    "most scattering events at a rhic are not from central collisions .",
    "so one has to cope with a distribution of volumes , each of it associated with its own effective deconfinement temperature and width .",
    "due to such finite volume effects the concept of a sharp transition becomes blurred even when the effects of quarks , which convert the transition into a crossover @xcite , are not yet taken into account .",
    "ultimately one may want to extend lgt studies of the deconfining transition with bcs reflecting the confined outside world to full qcd . before doing so",
    ", additional experience can be gained from pure su(3 ) lgt . in future work",
    "we intend to perform simulation for the physically more realistic confinement wall bcs , which we introduced in section  [ sub_cwall ] .",
    "further , the entire equilibrium thermodynamics of the deconfined phase ought to be addressed .",
    "close to the transition point the deconfined phase can only be studied non - perturbatively .",
    "equilibrium qcd on the lattice allows this from first principles .",
    "but the assumption that equilibrium configurations can capture the essence of the transition is a strong one .",
    "studies of the important dynamical aspects of the transition have to rely on phenomenological approaches .",
    "for instance , models which use hydrodynamics in the quark gluon plasma stage reproduce experimental data on particle abundances and flows well  @xcite .",
