    "when charge carriers couple to phonons , magnons , or other bosonic excitations , the resulting dressed quasiparticles  the polarons  often behave drastically different from the free carriers . this is why understanding the consequences of carrier - boson coupling is important for many materials such as organic semiconductors,@xcite cuprates,@xcite manganites,@xcite two - gap superconductors like mgb@xmath0,@xcite and many more . to describe them",

    "longer - range coupling that modulates the carrier s on - site potential leads to @xmath2 couplings that depend on the boson s momentum , such as the frhlich@xcite or the breathing - mode models.@xcite if the bosons modulate the hopping of the carrier , the coupling @xmath3 depends on the momenta of both carrier and boson , as is the case in the su - schrieffer - heger ( ssh ) model@xcite or for a hole coupled to magnons in an antiferromagnet , as described by a @xmath4 model.@xcite    all these electron - phonon coupling models assume that the coupling is _ linear _ in the lattice displacements .",
    "this is a natural assumption because if the displacements are small , the linear term is the most important contribution .",
    "however , the coefficient of the linear term may vanish due to symmetries of the crystal . in such cases ,",
    "the most important contribution is the _",
    "quadratic _ term .",
    "here we introduce , motivate and study in detail a hamiltonian describing such quadratic electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling relevant for many common crystal structures , consisting of intercalated sublattices of heavy and light atoms .",
    "we focus on the single carrier limit and the parameter regime where the carrier dynamically changes the effective lattice potential from a single - well to a double - well ; hence , we call this _ the double - well e - ph coupling_. we use the momentum - average approximation@xcite to compute the properties of the resulting polaron with high accuracy . we find that although the polaron shares some similarities with the holstein polaron , it also differs in important aspects . indeed ,",
    "we show that the physics of the double - well e - ph coupling model can not be described by a renormalized linear holstein model .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first systematic , non - perturbative study of such a quadratic model .",
    "previously@xcite we studied the effect of quadratic ( and higher ) corrections added to a linear term .",

    "other works considered complicated non - linear lattice potentials and couplings but treated the oscillators classically,@xcite or discussed anharmonic lattice potentials but for purely linear coupling.@xcite away from the single - carrier limit , the holstein - hubbard model in infinite dimensions was shown to have parameter regions where the effective lattice potential has a double - well shape;@xcite this was then used to explain ferroelectricity in some rare - earth oxides .",
    "however , the effect of a double - well e - ph coupling on the properties of a single polaron were not explored in a fully quantum - mechanical model on a low - dimensional lattice .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the hamiltonian , motivate its use for relevant systems , and discuss all approximations made in deriving it . in section  [ sec : formalism ] we review the theoretical means by which we study our hamiltonian . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results , and in section  [ sec : summary ] we give our concluding discussion and an outlook for future work .",

    "[ fig:2d_lattice ] for 2d cases .",
    "the 3d crystal would have a perovskite structure but we do not discuss it explicitly because , as we show below , dimensionality plays no role in determining the polaron properties .    the undoped compound is an insulator made of light atoms , shown as filled circles , intercalated between heavy ones , shown as empty circles . to zeroth order , the vibrations of the heavy atoms can be ignored while those of the light atoms are described by independent harmonic oscillators @xmath5 , where @xmath6 annihilates a phonon at the @xmath7 light atom .",
    "( we set the mass of the light ions @xmath8 , and also @xmath9 ) . in reality",
    "there is weak coupling between these oscillators giving rise to a dispersive optical phonon branch .",
    "however , the dispersion can be ignored if its bandwidth is small compared to all other energy scales .",
    "we do so in the following .",
    "consider now the addition of a carrier .",
    "if it occupies orbitals centered on the heavy atoms , its coupling to the oscillations of the light atoms is described by breathing - mode coupling models.@xcite here we are instead interested in the case where the carrier is located on the light atoms .",
    "such is the situation for a cuo@xmath0 plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_lattice ] , since the parent compound is a charge - transfer insulator@xcite so that upon doping , the holes reside on the light o sites ( of course , there are additional complications due to the magnetic order of the cu spins ; we ignore these degrees of freedom in the following ) .",
    "the carrier moves through nearest - neighbor hopping between light atoms : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the carrier annihilation operator at light atom @xmath12 .    given the symmetric equilibrium location of the light ion hosting the carrier between two heavy ions , it is clear that the e - ph coupling can not be linear in the displacement @xmath13 of that light ion : the sign of the displacement can not matter .",
    "thus , e - ph coupling in such a material is not described by a holstein model .",
    "this assertion is supported by detailed modelling . for simplicity , we assume that the interactions with the neighboring heavy atoms are dominant ( longer - range interactions can be easily included but lead to no qualitative changes ) .",
    "there are , then , two distinct contributions to the e - ph coupling :    [ [ electrostatic - coupling ] ] electrostatic coupling : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the carrier changes the total charge of the light ion it resides on . if the distance between adjacent light and heavy ions is @xmath14 , and if @xmath15 is their additional coulomb interaction due to the carrier , then the potential increases by @xmath16 .",
    "this is an even function and thus has no linear ( or any odd ) terms in @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic term @xmath17 can be either positive or negative , depending on the charge of the carrier ( electron or hole ) .",
    "[ [ hybridization ] ] hybridization : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    even though charge transport is assumed to take place in a light atom band , there is always some hybridization @xmath18 allowing the carrier to hop onto an adjacent heavy ion .",

    "the hopping @xmath18 depends on the distance between ions ; for small displacements @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some material - specific constant .",
    "because the light ion is centered between two heavy ions , such contributions add to @xmath23 = \\frac{-2t_{lh}^2}{\\delta}\\left [ 1 + \\alpha^2    ( \\delta x)^2 \\right ] .",
    "$ ] the potential is again even in @xmath24 . in this case , the coefficient of the quadratic term is always negative .    given that @xmath25 , it follows that the largest ( quadratic ) contribution to the e - ph coupling for such a crystal has the general form : @xmath26 where all prefactors have been absorbed into the energy scale @xmath27 , and the sum is over all light ions . from the analysis above we know that @xmath27 may have either sign .",
    "physically , @xmath28 shows that the presence of a carrier modifies the curvature of its ion s lattice potential , and thus changes the phonon frequency at that site from @xmath29 to @xmath30 . if @xmath31 then @xmath32 , making phonon creation more costly .",
    "as we show in appendix [ newap ] , this leads to a rather uninteresting large polaron with very weakly renormalized properties .",
    "this is why in the following we focus on the case with @xmath33 .    for sufficiently negative @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath34 vanishes or becomes imaginary , _ i.e. _ the lattice is unstable .",
    "this is unphysical ; in reality the bare ionic potential contains higher order terms that stabilize the lattice .",
    "this means that for @xmath33 we must include anharmonic ( quartic ) terms in the phonon hamiltonian and , for consistency , also in the e - ph coupling , so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scale of the anharmonic corrections . in physical situations",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 , or the taylor expansions would not be sensible starting points .",
    "the anharmonic terms in @xmath39 make the total hamiltonian unwieldy , because the phonon vacuum @xmath40 is no longer the undoped ground - state , and the new undoped ground state @xmath41 has no simple analytical expression . in order to be able to proceed with an analytical approximation",
    ", we argue that these terms can be absorbed into the e - ph coupling ; this is a key approximation of the model .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : at those lattice sites that do not have a carrier , the quartic terms have little effect if @xmath42 .",
    "this statement is verified by exact diagonalization of @xmath39 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quartic_effects ] where we plot the overlap @xmath43 ( per site ) between the undoped ground - states with and without anharmonic corrections , as well as the average number of phonons at a site of the undoped lattice . even for unphysically large values @xmath44 ,",
    "the overlap @xmath45 remains close to 1 while @xmath46 , showing that the undoped ground - state has not changed significantly in the presence of anharmonic corrections .",
    "from now we ignore these corrections at sites without an additional carrier .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    however , for sites that have a carrier present , we can not ignore the anharmonic term : as discussed , it is crucial for stabilizing the lattice . since this term is similar to the quartic term in the e - ph coupling , they can both be grouped together , resulting in the approximate hamiltonian for our crystal : @xmath47 with an effective quartic e - ph coupling term @xmath48 , which from now on we will simply call @xmath49 .",
    "this is the hamiltonian that we investigate in this work .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us review what we are neglecting when we discard the anharmonic corrections at the unoccupied sites .",
    "besides ignoring the change in the undoped ground state from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( which is a reasonable approximation if @xmath52 , as discussed ) , we also assume that only the e - ph coupling can change the number of phonons in the system , whereas in the full model the phonon number is also changed by anharmonic corrections .",
    "this latter approximation is valid if the timescale for anharmonic phonon processes @xmath53 is much longer than the characteristic polaron timescale @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the effective polaron mass .",
    "let us briefly summarize the basic properties of the lattice potential , which equals @xmath56 for sites without an extra carrier , and @xmath57 for sites with one carrier .",
    "if @xmath58 , the first term describes a harmonic well with frequency @xmath34 and @xmath59 describes a single well centered at @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 , however , @xmath34 becomes purely imaginary . in this case , @xmath59 becomes a double - well potential with a local maximum at @xmath60 .",
    "the two wells are centered at @xmath62 for @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 , which locally describes a harmonic well of frequency @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , this is independent of @xmath49 , whose only role is to control the location and depth of the two wells ( they are further apart and deeper for _ smaller _ @xmath49 ) .",
    "we want to find the single particle green s function @xmath66 , where @xmath67^{-1}$ ] is the resolvent of hamiltonian . from this",

    "one important property of this hamiltonian is that it preserves the phonon number parity on each site : because its terms only change the number of phonons by multiples of two , any eigenstate is a sum of basis states having only even ( or only odd ) number of phonons .",
    "the hilbert space can thus be divided into an _ even _ and an _ odd _ ( phonon number ) sector , which can be diagonalized separately .",
    "we emphasize that this symmetry is different from the parity symmetry under a global lattice inversion @xmath78 .",
    "the latter has been studied extensively for the linear holstein model,@xcite where it was shown that polaron states with total momentum @xmath79 have well defined ( spatial ) parity .",
    "the phonon number parity , on the other hand , corresponds to a unitary transformation @xmath80 , i.e. , a local inversion of the phonon coordinates .",
    "the number parity symmetry also correlates with the _ local _ spatial parity of the ions , since the spatial parity operator for site @xmath12 can be written as @xmath81 .",
    "we compute the green s function via the same continued matrix fractions method@xcite previously used by us to compute the green s function of a generalized holstein model with linear and higher - order terms@xcite within the framework of the momentum average ( ma ) approximation .",

    "finally , the green s function is : @xmath135 one can now use the matrices @xmath126 to generate the generalized propagators @xmath97 , which allow one to reconstruct the entire polaron wavefunction ( within this variational space).@xcite for the quantities of interest here , however , the single - particle green s function suffices .",
    "here we calculate the green s function for a state that already has a phonon in the system .",
    "since the phonon number can only change by @xmath136 or @xmath137 , this single phonon can never be moved to another site , so it is natural to compute the green s function in real space .",

    "we begin our analysis with the atomic limit since it is a good starting point for understanding the properties of the small polaron , which is the more interesting regime .",
    "however , we note an important distinction between the holstein model and our double - well model . in the former ,",
    "the atomic limit is the infinite - coupling limit . in the latter",
    ", @xmath49 sets an additional energy scale .",
    "thus , the atomic limit is not the same as the strong coupling limit ; the latter also requires that @xmath146 be small .    before doing any computations",
    ", we can describe some general features of the spectrum .",
    "as already discussed , the phonon component of the wavefunctions has either even or odd phonon number parity .",
    "since this is due to the spatial symmetry in the local ionic displacement , in any eigenstate the ion is equally likely to be found in either well . as usual",
    ", the ground state has _ even _",
    "symmetry since it has no nodes in its wavefunction .",
    "subsequent eigenstates always have one more node than the preceding eigenstate , so states with even and odd parity alternate .",
    "the exception is the limit of infinite well separation , @xmath147 , where the @xmath148 and @xmath149 eigenstates become degenerate .",
    "the system can then spontaneously break parity to have the ion definitely located in the left or in the right well , like in a ferroelectric . for a finite @xmath49",
    "this is not possible in the single carrier limit , but it can be achieved at finite carrier concentration through spontaneous symmetry breaking .    as discussed , our results are obtained with ma . in the atomic limit ma",
    "is exact@xcite because for @xmath145 the free propagator is diagonal in real - space so the terms ignored by ma vanish .",
    "thus , ma results must be identical here to those obtained by other exact means . to check our implementation of ma",

    "note that due to the parity - preserving nature of the hamiltonian there is no analog of the polaron+one - phonon continuum starting at @xmath186 , which is observed in all linear coupling models . trying to mimic the results of the double - well coupling with a linear model will",
    ", therefore , lead to a wrong assignment for the value of @xmath29 .    at small @xmath155 ,",
    "the polaron band flattens out just below the polaron+two - phonon continuum . with increasing @xmath155 , its bandwidth decreases",
    "as the polaron becomes heavier , and additional bound states appear below the continuum .",
    "this is similar to the evolution of the spectrum of a holstein polaron when moving towards stronger effective coupling.@xcite however , as already discussed , this does not mean that the two hamiltonians can be mapped onto one another .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also discuss some of the features of the odd sector .",
    "in particular , we focus on the local green s function @xmath187 , which can be written as @xmath188 with @xmath189",
    ". one can verify that @xmath190 equals the ma@xmath92 self - energy for the _ even _ sector , up to a shift by @xmath29 of its frequency .",
    "the equation for @xmath187 then shows that the odd sector spectral function comprises two parts : ( i ) the first term is just the momentum - averaged spectral function of the even - sector , shifted in energy by @xmath29 due to the presence of the extra phonon .",
    "one can think of these as states where the even - sector polaron does not interact with the extra phonon .",
    "this contribution therefore has weight starting from @xmath186 ; ( ii ) the second part describes interactions between the polaron and the extra phonon . an interesting question is whether these can lead to a bound state , _",
    "i.e. _ to a new polaron with odd numbers of phonons in its cloud",
    ".    this question is answered in fig .",
    "[ fig : finit_t_odd ] where we plot @xmath191 for different values of @xmath155 and @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath173 , in one dimension .",
    "the vertical bars indicate the position of @xmath194 , where indeed a continuum begins , as expected from the previous discussion . at sufficiently strong coupling @xmath155",
    "we find a discrete bound state below that continuum , showing that the polaron can bind the extra phonon .",
    "in fact , it is more proper to say that the extra phonon ( which is localized somewhere on the lattice ) binds the polaron to itself and therefore localizes it .",
    "one can think of this as an example of `` self - trapping '' , except here there is an external trapping agent in the form of the extra phonon .",
    "one might wonder whether this localized bound state in the odd sector could ever be at an energy below the polaron ground - state energy @xmath195 of the even sector , _",
    "i.e. _ become the true ground - state .",
    "this is not the case ; as explained above , in the atomic limit the ionic states alternate between even and odd symmetry .",
    "introducing a finite hopping allows the polaron to further lower its energy by delocalizing , but this is only possible in the even sector .",
    "thus , we always expect the even - sector polaron to have an energy below that of this localized state .    as stated before , the two subspaces with even and odd phonon number are never mixed , at least at zero temperature . at finite temperature ,",
    "the extra charge is inserted not into the phonon vacuum but into a mixed state containing a number of thermally excited phonons .",
    "we therefore expect the resulting spectral function to show features of both the even and odd sectors . to be more precise , some spectral weight should be shifted from the even - sector spectral weight to the odd - sector spectral weight as @xmath196 increases and there is a higher probability to find one or more thermal phonons in the undoped state .",
    "we plan to study the temperature depend properties of this double - well coupling elsewhere .",
    "here we introduced and motivated a model for purely quadratic e - ph coupling , relevant for certain types of intercalated lattices , wherein the carrier dynamically changes the on - site lattice potential from a single well into a double well potential .",
    "all the approximations made in deriving this model were analyzed .",
    "in particular , we argued that ignoring the anharmonic lattice terms at the sites not hosting the carrier should be a good approximation .",
    "however , a more in - depth numerical analysis might be needed to further validate this assumption .    we used the momentum average approximation to obtain the model s ground state properties and its spectral function in the single polaron limit , in one and two dimensions .",
    "we found that for sufficiently strong quadratic coupling a small polaron forms .",
    "although the polaron behaves somewhat similarly to the polaron of the linear holstein model , the double - well model can not be mapped onto an effective linear model : apart from the difference in the location of the continuum in the even sector , the double - well model also has an odd sector that should be visible at finite @xmath196 , and which is entirely absent in the holstein model .",
    "this is due to the double - well potential model s invariance to local inversions of the ionic coordinate ; this symmetry is not found in the holstein model .",
    "the polaron in this odd sector is also qualitatively different from the holstein polaron , in that it is localized near the additional phonon present in the system when the carrier is injected . of course",
    ", if the assumption of an einstein mode is relaxed , then the phonon acquires a finite speed and this polaron would become delocalized , as expected for a system invariant to translations .",
    "however , this would still be qualitatively different than a regular polaronic solution because this polaron s dispersion would be primarily controlled by the phonon bandwidth , not the carrier hopping .",
    "our results suggest that researchers interpreting their measurements from , _",
    "e.g. _ , angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , must carefully consider the nature of their system s e - ph coupling : if they assume linear coupling where the lattice symmetry calls for a quadratic one , the parameters extracted from fitting to such models will have wrong values .    while we have laid here the basis for a thorough investigation of the properties of the double - well e - ph coupling model , much work remains .",
    "we believe that adjusting already existing numerical schemes such as diagrammatic monte carlo to this model is straightforward and look forward to a comparison of numerically exact results with our ma results .",
    "in addition , there are certain ranges of parameters for which ma is not well - suited , such as the adiabatic limit @xmath197 at weak coupling , or systems with finite carrier densities .",
    "we anticipate that these regimes will be explored with a range of numerical and analytical tools , especially the finite carrier regime which should be relevant for modelling ferroelectric materials .",
    "we plan to extend our study of the double - well e - ph coupling beyond the single - polaron limit .",
    "we deem especially interesting the parameter range where the lattice potential remains a single well if only one carrier is present , but changes into a double well when a second charge is added . in this case",
    ", we anticipate the appearance of a strongly bound bipolaron while the single polarons are relatively light .",
    "such states are not possible in the holstein model .",
    "finally , extending our ma treatment to finite temperature should yield interesting insights into the interplay between the two symmetry sectors revealed by the spectral weight .",
    "we thank nserc and qmi for financial support .",

    "we can calculate this overlap analytically to find @xmath259 for @xmath260 , even for @xmath261 we still have @xmath262 .",
