    "when the plasmon arrives at the mos@xmath0 , the plasmon may either be converted to an exciton , resulting in frequency - shifted photon emission from the mos@xmath0 , or it can be converted back to a photon at the end of the wire .",

[ mos2exciton],width=604 ]      in addition to plasmons exciting the mos@xmath0 , the reverse process can also occur ; that is , excitons in the mos@xmath0 can be converted to plasmons that propagate along the wire and are rescattered as photons . to demonstrate that mos@xmath0 fluorescence can couple to ag nanowire plasmons , the excitation is aligned with the overlap region of the mos@xmath0 flake / nanowire end , and the collection focal volume is aligned to the uncovered nanowire end ( the reverse configuration of fig .  [ misaligned ] ) .",
    "figure  [ mos2exciton]a shows the resulting fluorescence image when the sample is scanned in this configuration with the excitation laser polarized parallel to the wire .",
    "again , a ccd image of the mos@xmath0/wire structure is overlayed on this image .",
    "compared to the localized feature in fig .",
    "[ misaligned]a , the present image shows an attribute that extends beyond the end of the wire .",
    "this is suggestive of plasmonic excitation along the mos@xmath0/wire interface , not just at the covered end .",
    "as the laser excitation scans over the mos@xmath0/wire interface , photons that re - emerge from the uncovered end are still detected by the confocal volume of the apd .",
    "if plasmons could only be excited at the end of the wire and not along the length of the mos@xmath0/wire overlap , the attribute in this image would look similar to the feature in fig .",
    "[ misaligned]a .",
    "the insets display scans of the feature when the excitation light is polarized both parallel ( upper left ) and perpendicular ( upper right ) to the wire .",
    "evident from comparing the two insets is an increase in the emission from the uncovered end when the excitation is parallel to the nanowire axis .",
    "the enhancement again suggests the nanowire provides an antenna - like enhancement of the excitation . because mos@xmath0 absorption does not prefer a linear polarization , any mismatch results from excitation effects .    finally , we demonstrate it is possible to use the ag nanowire both as a channel for near - field excitation of the mos@xmath0 flake and to recollect the resultant mos@xmath0 fluorescence .",
    "the re - excited plasmons , at the mos@xmath0 photon energy , can propagate back along the wire and rescatter to the far - field as photons . figure  [ mos2exciton]b shows a fluorescence image of the entire sample with the excitation and collection aligned . for this image",
    ", we have rescaled the end of the wire not covered by the mos@xmath0 .",
    "there is a pronounced fluorescence feature at the excitation end of the wire that is stronger than the background . to investigate this feature ,",
    "spectra were collected for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the wire ( fig .",
    "[ mos2exciton]c ) .",
    "the spectra reveal this is indeed pl from the mos@xmath0 flake ; see fig .",
    "[ scan]b for comparison .",
    "the pronounced polarization contrast in the two different excitation directions suggests that the ag nanowire plasmons mediate this excitation and collection process .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated photonic and plasmonic interactions between an individual ag nanowire and single - layer mos@xmath0 .",
    "we found it is possible to excite mos@xmath0 with ag nanowire plasmons as well as convert decaying mos@xmath0 excitons into ag wire plasmons .",
    "this first step shows that there is pronounced nanoscale light - matter interaction between plasmons and atomically - thin material that can be exploited for nanophotonic integrated circuits .",
    "a natural next step is the creation of a near - field detector based on mos@xmath0 as well as mos@xmath0 light - emitting diodes coupled to on - chip nanoplasmonic circuitry .",
    "a solution of silver nanowires ( nanostructured and amorphous materials , inc . ) with 386 nm average diameter and 8.6 @xmath7 m average length is diluted at a 2000:1 ratio of ethanol to solution , and a small amount ( @xmath18150 @xmath7l ) is stamped onto a clean silica coverslip using a polycarbonate membrane filter ( 5 @xmath7 m pore diameter , spi supplies , inc . ) .",
