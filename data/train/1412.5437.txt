    "the most fascinating explanation of recent observations of the polarization of the cmb radiation @xcite is the hypothesis of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "however , there are other sources of polarization - dependent deformations of the cmb spectrum that have been pointed out ( galactic dust @xcite and topological defects @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore a similar effect : the polarization - dependent distortion of the cmb spectrum in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the coupling of the magnetic field to the cmb is due to the field - dependent qed vacuum polarization . in order to determine precisely this effect we quantize electromagnetic waves propagating on the magnetic background .",
    "then we consider the properties of the thermal state of the quantized radiation . in our analysis",
    "we shall use the results obtained previously in the classical theory @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a relativistic lagrangian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the scalar and the pseudoscalar invariants of the electromagnetic field ,    @xmath3    we will employ the heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xmath4 derived in qed @xcite under the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields _ do not change _ in space and time ,    @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the fine structure constant and @xmath7v / m is the characteristic value of the electric field built from the electron mass and the universal constants , called the critical field by heisenberg and euler .",
    "the corresponding magnetic critical field is @xmath8 t .",
    "the invariants @xmath1 and @xmath2 enter the lagrangian ( [ he ] ) through the expressions :    @xmath9    the heisenberg - euler lagrangian can also be used for fields whose variation in space and time is slow on the characteristic quantum scale : @xmath10 m and @xmath11s .",
    "we apply the theory based on this lagrangian to the description of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation in the presence of a magnetic field .    following the procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we separate the electromagnetic field into a strong , constant magnetic field @xmath12 and a weak wave @xmath13 , @xmath14 next , we expand the lagrangian keeping only the quadratic terms in @xmath13 ( linear terms do not contribute to the equations of motion ) , @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 these derivatives of the heisenberg - euler lagrangian are to be evaluated at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "aiming at the quantization of the @xmath13 fields , we find it more convenient to use not the lagrangian but the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the classical hamiltonian expressed as a function of divergenceless canonical fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 has the form : @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the projector on the direction of the magnetic field and @xmath23 the canonical evolution equations for @xmath24 and @xmath20 , obtained from the lagrangian @xmath25 , are :    @xmath26    these equations have a complete set of solutions in the form of normalized monochromatic complex mode vectors .",
    "each mode has the @xmath27 part and the @xmath28 part ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 following adler @xcite , we called these modes parallel ( the @xmath20 field lies in the @xmath31-plane ) and perpendicular ( the @xmath20 field perpendicular to this plane ) .",
    "the mode frequencies are given by the following formulas : @xmath32 where the two refractive indices are :    @xmath33    and @xmath34 is the angle between the direction of propagation @xmath35 and the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the whole information about the nature of nonlinearity is contained in two functions of the magnitude of the magnetic field , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the heisenberg - euler lagrangian these functions do not have a closed form ; they were evaluated numerically using _ mathematica _ @xcite .",
    "note that the magnetic field has no effect on waves propagating along the field ( @xmath34=0 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the changes @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the refractive indices as functions of the magnetic field @xmath40 when the effect is the largest ; the direction of the field is perpendicular to the direction of observation . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the variation of the refractive indices with the angle of observation for the critical magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "having found a complete set of modes , we can construct field operators as the following linear combinations of the annihilation and creation operators ,    @xmath42    where the index @xmath43 takes on the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the standard commutation relations between the annihilation and creation operators , @xmath46=\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta({\\bm k}-{\\bm k}'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] guarantee the correct canonical commutation relations between the field operators , @xmath47=i\\hbar\\epsilon_{ijk}\\partial_k\\delta({\\bm r}-{\\bm r}').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these relations confirm that the fields @xmath24 and @xmath20 ( and not @xmath48 and @xmath20 ) form the canonically conjugate pair of fields @xcite .",
    "their commutation relations are universal since they do not depend on the properties of the medium ( in our case the background magnetic field ) .",
    "the substitution of the field operators into the formula ( [ ham ] ) gives the quantum energy operator , @xmath49",
    "in the thermal state at the temperature @xmath50 the density matrix @xmath51 is an exponential function of the hamiltonian ( [ qham ] ) , @xmath52 in the presence of the magnetic field , the hamiltonian ( [ qham ] ) contains the modified frequencies ( [ freq ] ) .",
    "the average density of the cmb photons per unit volume @xmath53 in the thermal state with the wave vector @xmath54 and polarization @xmath43 is : @xmath55 the influence of the magnetic field on the spectrum shows through the modification of the frequencies . since both refractive indices @xmath56 are greater than one , the spectrum of the cmb radiation looks like coming from regions of higher effective temperature @xmath57 .",
    "an important characteristic feature of the spectrum is its dependence on the polarization ; the effective temperature for the perpendicular polarization is larger than the effective temperature for the parallel polarization .",
    "the change in the temperature due to the change of the refractive index is quite large for strong magnetic field .",
    "already for the critical field the increase in temperature is 2.4mk for the perpendicular mode and 0.9mk for the parallel mode .",
    "these values exceed by far the standard deviations in the measurements of the cmb temperature",
    ".        the characteristic dependence of the observable temperature of the cmb radiation on polarization would be helpful in identifying regions where there exist very strong magnetic fields .",
    "the strongest magnetic fields in the universe exist in the vicinity of magnetars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted distortion of the cmb spectrum by those fields can not be detected with the present observational means .",
    "the problem lies in the smallness of the region where the magnetic field is strong , coupled with the large distance to the nearest magnetar .",
    "one may hope that in the future the qed effects of strong magnetic fields will be accessible to observations due to improvements in angular resolution and in the precision of the measurements of temperature fluctuations in cmb . at present",
    "one may hope to use the calculated effects of magnetic fields on the polarization only when the extension of regions with strong magnetic fields is much larger than that in the vicinity of magnetars .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for pointing out the difficulties in observing the effects predicted in this paper .",
