    "we consider the hyperbolic conservation laws @xmath0 with the state vector u @xmath1 u(t , x ) : @xmath2 , for a time interval @xmath3 $ ] for some @xmath4 and an open bounded computational domain @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the flux function .",
    "an initial condition @xmath7 is given along with appropriate boundary conditions . despite the smoothness of @xmath8 , the solution to ( [ eq1 ] ) may develop a discontinuity within a finite time .",
    "high order numerical approximations of the developed discontinuity suffer from the gibbs phenomenon yielding spurious oscillations near the discontinuity .",
    "these oscillations not only degrade the accuracy of the approximation but may also cause instability of the scheme . since the publications by harten et al .",
    "@xcite and by jiang and shu @xcite , the essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) and weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) methods have been one of the most powerful numerical methods that can successfully deal with the gibbs oscillations and widely used in various applications .",
    "numerous modifications of the original eno and weno methods have been also developed .",
    "these include recent works such as weno - m @xcite , weno - z @xcite , power - eno @xcite , weno - p @xcite , modification of the eno basis @xcite and weno-@xmath9 methods @xcite , to name a few .",
    "there is no _ best _ eno / weno variation because all variations have their own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "however , most variations have the common element for their construction : the polynomial reconstruction . in recent reviews of the weno methods by shu @xcite , the eno / weno reconstruction based on the non - polynomial functions such as the fourier functions",
    "is briefly mentioned such as the one used in @xcite . however , most eno / weno variations are based on the polynomial reconstruction . in this paper , let us call the eno / weno method based on the polynomial reconstruction as the regular eno / weno method .    in this paper , we present a simple new type of the eno / weno method based on the non - polynomial interpolation . as an example of the non - polynomial bases , we first use radial basis functions ( rbfs ) . as we will show later in this paper ,",
    "the choice of rbfs as a non - polynomial basis function is not necessary but the perturbation form works in more general sense .",
    "furthermore , the presented method is not a hybrid method that combines the eno / weno method with the rbf method or other high order methods .",
    "the presented method is basically the eno / weno method but with the interpolation coefficients slightly modified . in the seminal work of @xcite ,",
    "the ader method was developed based on the polyharmonic spline , which belongs to the family of piecewise smooth rbfs .",
    "the motivation of the method presented in @xcite was to adopt the weno method efficiently for the arbitrary geometry and unstructured mesh by using the meshless feature of rbfs .",
    "our main motivation in this paper , however , is not in using the meshless feature of rbfs but is to enhance the original eno / weno accuracy by modifying the interpolation coefficients . for this",
    ", we need free parameters and need to optimize them . in @xcite",
    "the polyharmonic spline was used and there was no undetermined shape parameter  or the shape parameter is fixed as @xmath10 and the order of convergence is overall fixed once the size of each stencil @xmath11 is fixed .",
    "but in our proposed method , the shape parameter is essential .",

    "the 2d non - polynomial finite volume interpolation is more beneficial than the 2d polynomial interpolation .",

    "as mentioned in introduction , the meshless feature of rbfs was combined with the weno method in @xcite where the shape parameter was globally fixed for the reconstruction .",
