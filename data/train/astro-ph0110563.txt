    "1993 ; krichbaum et al .",
    "1998 ; lo et al . 1993 ) , is thought to coincide with this black hole candidate .",
    "its radio spectrum from cm to mm wavelengths is roughly a power - law , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the sharp cut - off at the low frequency end ( @xmath4 ghz ) appears to be due to free - free absorption in the ionized gas along the line - of - sight ( davies et al .",
    "1976 ) . in the mm region , a spectral bump ( zylka et al . 1992 ; zylka et al . 1995 ) has been confirmed by simultaneous @xmath5 cm to @xmath6 mm radio observations ( falcke , et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting that a distinct emission component surrounds the event horizon , since the highest frequencies appear to correspond to the smallest spatial scales ( melia , jokipii & narayanan 1992 ; melia 1992 , 1994 ; nayaran , yi & mahadevan 1995 ; falcke et al . 1998",
    "; coker & melia 2000 ) .",
    "the spectrum turns over in the sub - mm range .",
    "several different scenarios have been introduced ( see melia & falcke 2001 ) to account for sagittarius a * s spectrum , ranging from jet emission ( falcke & markoff 2000 ) to heavily - advected , large - scale accretion disks ( narayan , yi & mahadevan 1995 ) , a picture that in recent years has spawned several other versions , including disks with mass - loss ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) , and those with significant convection ( narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ) . the approach followed by our group ( see melia 1992 ) has been based on the idea that sagittarius a * may be accreting a low specific angular momentum plasma , which radiates inefficiently because its magnetic field is very low ( kowalenko & melia 1999 ; coker & melia 2000 ) , or is otherwise weakly luminous because the rate at which gas actually reaches the event horizon is smaller than one would infer based on simple bondi - hoyle estimates ( see , e.g. , quataert & gruzinov 2000 ; melia , liu & coker 2000 ) .",
    "large scale 3d hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , coker & melia 1997 ) do show ( not surprisingly ) that in the absence of an anomalously high viscosity near the bondi - hoyle capture radius , the accreted gas has a small , though variable , specific angular momentum @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "these values of @xmath10 may be consistent with the specific angular momentum associated either with the thermal motion of the gas or with the orbital velocities .",
    "with such a small value of @xmath10 , the infalling gas does not circularize until it reaches a radius @xmath11 , and depending on the physics of magnetic field annihilation , or generation ( see , e.g. , hawley et al .",
    "1996 ) , may not become an efficient radiator until it falls to within tens of schwarzschild radii of the event horizon .",
    "recent radio polarization measurements ( bower et al . 1999 ; aitken et al . 2000 ) seem to support the spectral signature expected for such a low angular momentum gas . in melia",
    "et al . ( 2000 , 2001 ) , we demonstrated that a small keplerian structure , with a magnetic field dominated by its azimuthal component inferred from earlier magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley et al .",
    "1996 ) , not only produces the mm bump , but also accounts for these polarization characteristics , especially the @xmath12 flip of the polarization angle near the mm peak ( bromley et al .",
    "however , this inner keplerian region does not produce the longer - wavelength emission .",
    "the radio photons from sagittarius a * must be produced at larger radii , in the circularization region where the infalling gas evolves from quasi - spherical accretion toward a settled keplerian configuration at smaller radii . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the results of a detailed analysis of this circularization region , and demonstrate how the latest combination of cm , and x - ray data already constrains heavily the nature of its emissivity , and at the same time provides a telling discriminant between two principal mechanisms for producing the high - energy emission in this source .",
    "having identified the essential elements of the inner keplerian structure that correctly account for the mm and sub - mm spectrum and polarization of sagittarius a * ( melia et al . 2000 , 2001 ) , we here take these physical quantities as inner boundary conditions for the circularization region . the strength of the magnetic field in the inner region is calculated based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulations of brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and hawley et al .",
    "these results are conveniently expressed in terms of two parameters , the ratio of the stress to the magnetic energy density , @xmath13 , and the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the thermal pressure , @xmath14 .",
    "because the specific angular momentum of the infalling gas is assumed to be small , the accretion at large radii can be approximated as quasi - spherical .",
    "thus , to match the keplerian flow at small radii ( typically within the inner @xmath15 ) , the gas kinetic energy associated with the radial motion in the quasi - spherical region must be dissipated into thermal or turbulent energy .",
    "the centimeter radio emission is presumably produced as a result of this dissipation .",
    "we will assume that the circularization region has a flattened shape , and that its vertical structure is determined by balancing the thermal pressure gradient with the gravitational force in that direction .",
    "at the same time , we also assume that @xmath10 is conserved in the circularization region , with the justification that most of it is dissipated once the plasma circularizes .",
    "this is clearly only an approximation , and in reality , we expect there to be some angular momentum dissipation as the gas approaches the keplerian region .",
    "thus , specifying the outer radius of the latter to be @xmath16 , we have that the azimuthal velocity is given as @xmath17 .    for the temperature profile , we assume that a fixed fraction of the gravitational potential energy is dissipated into thermal energy and that this fraction is fixed by the value of the gas temperature @xmath18 at @xmath16 . in that case , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the gas constant , and @xmath22 is only weakly dependent on the gas temperature ( coker & melia 2000 ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath23 is determined by the partition of energy in the turbulent accretion flow , which depends on how dissipation drives the large scale turbulent motion , how effectively the energy is transported to small scales and converted into thermal energy , and then radiation .",
    "unfortunately , all these processes are not well understood .",
    "based on the equipartition argument , we know @xmath23 is smaller than one . together with the above expression for @xmath24 ,",
    "this then fixes the kinetic viscosity @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the scale height of the circularization region , @xmath27 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that @xmath29 is a constant in this region , and this uniquely determines the radial profile .",
    "when fitting sgr a * s radio spectrum below , we shall find that only the circularization region s outer radius remains as an adjustable parameter .",
    "one of the key results we report here is that the radio emission from sagittarius a * can not be produced via _ thermal _ synchrotron processes within a bounded accretion flow .",
    "this is rather easy to show , and is based on the fact that with the temperature limited from above by its virial value , the required radio emission can be produced by thermal synchrotron only with a strong magnetic field , whose energy density must be 15 times larger than its equipartition value to avoid excessive x - ray emission via thermal bremsstrahlung process . attempts to produce the observed radio spectrum with a more reasonable equipartition magnetic field result in high electron number densities , which in turn violate the observed x - ray flux ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to see this in detail",
    ", we have for a fully ionized bounded gas that @xmath30 k , where @xmath31 cm for the schwarzschild radius of sgr a*. the thermal emission from the circularization region is black - body limited , so that to produce a @xmath32 jy radio flux density at @xmath33 ghz with a thermal source at the galactic center , we need @xmath34 k , where @xmath35 is a characteristic radius in the emitter . combining this with the virial temperature limit , we have @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding temperature limit is @xmath37 k. now , to suppress the bremsstrahlung x - ray emission from a gas with temperature @xmath37 k below the observed value , the ratio of the cyclo - synchrotron emissivity at @xmath33 ghz to the bremsstrahlung emissivity at @xmath38 hz must be larger than the ratio of the observed flux densities , since part of the radio emission is self - absorbed .",
    "we can estimate the bremsstrahlung emissivity at @xmath38 hz as @xmath39 ergs s@xmath40 hz@xmath40 @xmath41 ( melia 1992 ) , and the cyclo - synchrotron emissivity at @xmath33 ghz as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 when @xmath44 is much bigger than 1 and @xmath45 ( mahadevan et al .",
    "if the magnetic field is in equipartition ( a conservative upper limit ) , then @xmath46 , and from @xmath47 , we get that @xmath48 must be larger than @xmath49 g. however , the electron number density is then @xmath50 @xmath41 , and for a source size of @xmath51 at the galactic center , the x - ray flux density at @xmath38 hz produced via thermal bremsstrahlung will be @xmath52 jy , which exceeds the observed limit .",
    "we conclude from this that the _ thermal _ radiative efficiency of a bounded accretion flow is not sufficient to account for the cm - wavelength spectral component of sgr a*. we ask , therefore , whether this long wavelength emission may be due to nonthermal particles produced by the gas in transition .",
    "the possible contribution of a nonthermal particle component in the accretion flow of sgr a * was introduced by markoff , melia , & sarcevic ( 1997 ) , primarily to explore whether the egret @xmath53-ray source 2eg j1746 - 2852 could be due to interactions among the decay products resulting from relativistic @xmath54 scatterings . within the context of the adaf model , mahadevan ( 1998 ) introduced the idea of accounting for the cm radio spectrum with a power - law electron distribution also produced via @xmath54 scatterings , but the predicted x - ray spectral index in this picture is not consistent with that observed . an alternative scenario , involving a static , quasi - monoenergetic electron distribution which may be produced by magnetic field reconnection ,",
    "was considered by duschl & lesch ( 1994 ) .    but",
    "relativistic electrons can also be produced by direct shock acceleration , and with our expectation that shocks may be present in the supersonic flow of the turbulent circularization region , it is reasonable to assess the merits of such a power - law distribution to account for sgr a * s radio spectrum , while at the same time not violating ( or perhaps even simultaneously explaining ) its x - ray spectrum as well .",
    "an important departure of this work from the earlier attempts at carrying out this fit is the much lower accretion rate we are adopting here , which significantly changes the interplay between the radio and x - ray emissivities .",
    "we will see below , in fact , that depending on the efficiency of converting gravitational energy to thermal energy , the x - rays can be produced either via self - comptonization in the keplerian region or via synchrotron emission by the power - law electrons in the circularization region .",
    "this is clearly highly relevant to future coordinated multi - wavelength observations , which should be able to distinguish between these two possible manifestations of the high - energy radiation .",
    "however , even a cursory inspection of the data will immediately show that the nonthermal electrons must have a rather steep spectral index .",
    "strong shock acceleration usually produces a power - law with an index of @xmath55 , much smaller than our best fit value ( see below ) .",
    "there are several reasons that can account for this .",
    "first , it is well known that the shock compression ratio @xmath56 , which determines the spectral index according to @xmath57 , can be reduced significantly in a strongly magnetized plasma ( kirk et al .",
    "2000 ; ballard & heavens 1991 ) . in our model",
    ", we have a magnetic field which is strong enough to decrease the compression ratio well below @xmath58 , which can therefore yield a power - law spectral index larger than @xmath59 .",
    "second , the circularization region may be turbulent , with a very irregular magnetic field .",
    "kirk et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) have demonstrated that braided magnetic fields can increase the power - law spectral index even further , to @xmath60 .",
    "third , duffy et al . (",
    "1995 ) noticed in their simulations that the accelerated ions can lead to the creation of a weaker subshock and an upstream precursor , whose effect also leads to a reduction of the compression ratio and a steeper spectral index .",
    "an additional factor that may be relevant here is that with rapid cooling ( we will see below that in some cases the nonthermal particles cool well before reaching the inner keplerian region ) the steady - state distribution function is characterized by a spectral index @xmath61 ( laan 1963 ; markoff et al .",
    "even so , turbulent shock acceleration is not well understood , so we must necessarily treat the spectral index and the number density of nonthermal particles as free parameters . for simplicity , we will assume that the former is the same throughout the circularization region , and that the ratio of the power - law electron number density to the total electron number density in the flow is constant .",
    "we shall see that the combination of cm , mm , and x - ray data do not leave much flexibility in the possible values of these quantities .",
    "in fact , our best fits ( see figs . 1 & 2 ) require an approximate equipartition between the thermal and nonthermal particle distributions in the circularization region .",
    "our two best fit models are shown in figures 1 ( model 1 ) and 2 ( model 2 ) .",
    "the flattened gas distribution has an inclination angle of @xmath62 to the line of sight , and the circularization region extends out to @xmath63 .",
    "the radio spectrum results from the superposition of power - law synchrotron emission components at different radii , with the lowest frequency part produced in the large , diluted outer segments , and the high frequency portion resulting from emission in the smaller , dense inner zone .",
    "the overall spectrum is relatively flat from @xmath6 ghz to @xmath64 ghz . from figure 1 , it is clear that the thermal emission from this region is negligible by comparison . the radiation below @xmath6 ghz , which is produced at radii beyond @xmath65 , is mostly absorbed by the ionized gas along the line - of - sight ( davies et al . 1976 ) .",
    "this type of fit to the radio spectrum therefore requires a circularization region extending beyond @xmath65 , but the upper limit to this radius is not well - defined . to fit the observed spectrum below @xmath6 ghz",
    ", we assume that the absorbing gas has a temperature of @xmath66 k , and we use the free - free optical depth given by walker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "model 1 has a relatively low efficiency of converting gravitational to thermal energy .",
    "the temperature in the accreting gas stays relatively low , increasing from @xmath67 k at @xmath63 , to its maximum value of @xmath68 k at the inner edge of the keplerian structure . from figure 1",
    ", it is evident that the electrons are not energetic enough to up - scatter radio photons into the x - ray band .",
    "so for this situation , the power - law electrons in the circularization region are producing the x - rays directly via optically - thin synchrotron emission .",
    "the predicted x - ray spectral index @xmath69 is therefore @xmath70 , where @xmath71 ( the particle spectral index ) is fixed by the relative strength of the radio to x - ray flux densities .",
    "our best fit for the radio and x - ray components requires a value @xmath72 , which falls within the _ chandra_-measured range of @xmath73 to @xmath59 ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this case",
    ", we expect there to be strongly correlated variability between the cm - radio emission and that at x - ray energies ( since both are produced within the circularization region ) , while the mm bump would not be as strongly correlated with the x - rays .",
    "model 2 has a much higher efficiency of energy conversion , and almost all of the dissipated gravitational energy goes into thermal energy .",
    "the inner keplerian region has a temperature of @xmath74 k , which is high enough to produce strong sub - mm and infrared emission , and the electrons can up - scatter some of them into the x - ray band . in this case",
    ", we would expect to see a strong correlated variability between the mm radio bump and the x - rays .",
    "however , in order to suppress the x - ray emission in the circularization region , the power - law electrons must have an index larger than @xmath75 .    whether or not self - comptonization dominates",
    "the high - energy emission can be determined with future coordinated multi - wavelength observations .",
    "if the cm - radio photons and the x - rays are produced by a single power - law , the particle spectral index must then be @xmath76 ( model 1 ) .",
    "however , if the x - rays are due mostly to self - comptonization from the inner keplerian region , this index must be larger than @xmath75 ( model 2 ) .",
    "an alternative prescription that can also avoid producing too many x - rays and infrared radiation is to introduce a cutoff in the particle energy .",
    "the required limit on the lorentz factor is then @xmath77 , which may result from particle acceleration due to magnetic reconnection or hydromagnetic wave turbulence ( litvinenko , 2000 ) .",
    "finally , it can also be shown that the electrons producing the optical emission have a lifetime shorter than @xmath78 minutes .",
    "this is much shorter than the advection time scale of @xmath5 hours through the zone , so the nonthermal particles advected into the keplerian region contribute little to the overall emission there .",
