    "chaotic dynamics due to interaction of nonlinear resonances in hamiltonian systems is studied in a broad range of application areas , from plasma physics to celestial mechanics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic time of predictability of any motion is nothing but the lyapunov time ( the inverse of the maximum lyapunov exponent ) of the motion . generally , the estimation of the lyapunov exponents is one of the most important tools in the study of chaotic motion @xcite , in particular in celestial mechanics .",
    "the lyapunov exponents characterize the mean rate of exponential divergence of trajectories close to each other in phase space .",
    "non - zero lyapunov exponents indicate chaotic character of motion , while the maximum lyapunov exponent equal to zero signifies regular ( periodic or quasiperiodic ) motion .    the development of methods of numerical computation of the lyapunov exponents has more than a 30 year history ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast , methods of analytical estimation of the lyapunov exponents started to be developed only recently @xcite .    in studies of the dynamics of the milky way , analysis of the lyapunov exponents has not yet been widely used , but nevertheless there are important achievements .",
    "@xcite used lyapunov exponents as a tool to find bar - induced manifestations of chaos in the local disk stellar kinematics .",
    "taking into account the perturbations from the bar solely ( for some particular bar strengths ) , he constructed `` lyapunov diagrams '' , presenting the lyapunov timescales of the orbits in the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath1 velocity plane at fixed space positions , and identified regular and chaotic domains in velocity space as a function of space position with respect to the bar .",
    "the lyapunov exponents were calculated on a cartesian grid of planar velocities .",
    "the fraction of chaotic orbits was demonstrated to obviously increase with the bar strength .",
    "however , the diagrams in @xcite can hardly be used to estimate real values of lyapunov times , because the saturation of the computed values of the lyapunov exponents was not controlled , while the adopted computation time , corresponding to three hubble times ( equivalently , @xmath2 galactic years ) , might not be enough for the saturation .",
    "in other words , the obtained values characterize not the whole chaotic regions of the phase space , but only rather small vicinities of the initial data .",
    "therefore , the computed values are the `` local '' values of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "this is testified by the fact that the variation of the lyapunov exponents in the diagrams of @xcite is smooth , while there must be a sharp distinction between the chaotic regions ( with non - zero lyapunov exponents ) and regular regions ( with zero lyapunov exponents ) in the divided phase space .    in connection with the problem of estimation of lyapunov timescales in the solar neighborhood",
    ", @xcite noted that , according to @xcite , for a fully overlapped system , the chaotic zone should have a lyapunov time @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the frequency of perturbation ) , corresponding to the separatrix pulsation period . in what follows",
    "we shall consider the model set of @xcite for the stellar dynamics in the solar neighborhood and show that the heuristic estimate @xmath5 severely underestimates the real lyapunov time . besides",
    ", we shall see that it is rather seldom that the considered dynamical systems , modeling the dynamics in the solar neighborhood , can be called `` fully overlapped '' .",
    "besides obtaining the lyapunov times , we shall estimate the diffusion times in the chaotic domain of the phase space , in the same model set .",
    "this will allow one to judge on the possibility for migration of the sun from the inner regions of the milky way to its current location .",
    "such a possibility , arising due to the overlapping of resonances in the phase space , was advocated and studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many problems on nonlinear resonances in mechanics and physics are described by the perturbed pendulum hamiltonian    @xmath6    ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first two terms in equation  ( [ h ] ) represent the hamiltonian @xmath7 of the unperturbed pendulum ; @xmath8 is the pendulum angle ( the resonance phase angle ) and @xmath9 is the momentum .",
    "the periodic perturbations are given by the last two terms ; @xmath10 is the phase angle of perturbation : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the perturbation frequency and @xmath13 is the initial phase of the perturbation .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are parameters .",
    "generally , equation  ( [ h ] ) describes a triplet ( triad ) of resonances : there are three trigonometric terms , each corresponding to a particular resonance . in the following sections , the case of a resonance duad is considered ( i.e. , @xmath16 or @xmath17 equals zero ) .",
    "it is convenient to describe the motion in the vicinity of the separatrices of the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) by means of the so - called separatrix map @xcite .",
    "it is a two - dimensional , area - preserving map given by    @xmath18    these equations give the classical separatrix map @xcite , valid in the symmetric ( @xmath19 ) case of perturbation .",
    "the variable @xmath20 of the map denotes the relative ( with respect to the unperturbed separatrix value ) pendulum energy @xmath21 , and @xmath10 retains its meaning of the phase angle of perturbation .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is the ratio of @xmath23 , the absolute value of the perturbation frequency , to @xmath24 , the frequency of the small - amplitude pendulum oscillations .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 in the case of @xmath19 has the form  @xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the value of the melnikov ",
    "arnold integral as defined in @xcite :    @xmath29    formula  ( [ w1 ] ) differs from that given in @xcite and @xcite by the term @xmath30 , which is small for @xmath31 . however , its contribution is significant for small values of @xmath22  @xcite , i.e. , in the case of adiabatic chaos .",
    "the kind of chaos ( adiabatic or non - adiabatic ) in model  ( [ h ] ) is identified by the value of @xmath22 : if @xmath32 , it is slow ( adiabatic ) , otherwise it is `` fast '' ( non - adiabatic ; @xcite ) .",
    "one iteration of the separatrix map corresponds to one period of the pendulum rotation or a half - period of its libration .",
    "the applicability of the theory of separatrix maps for description of the motion near the separatrices of the perturbed nonlinear resonance in the full range of the relative frequency of perturbation , including its low values , was considered and shown to be legitimate in @xcite .",
    "the separatrix map in the case of asymmetric ( @xmath33 ) perturbation is different from that in the symmetric ( @xmath19 ) case , because the energy increments are different for the prograde and the retrograde motions of the model pendulum @xcite .",
    "( the motion is called prograde or retrograde if the variation of @xmath8 with time is , respectively , positive or negative . ) the algorithm , taking this difference into account , constitutes the separatrix algorithmic map @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the values of the @xmath25 parameter for the prograde and retrograde motions respectively . in the case of asymmetric perturbation",
    "these values are different .",
    "equations  ( [ sam ] ) as well can be written in a shorter way @xcite :    @xmath37    the sign in the upper index of @xmath25 alternates at each iteration if @xmath38 ( i.e. , at librations ) ; the quantity @xmath39 denotes @xmath35 or @xmath36 , while @xmath40 denotes a corresponding value of @xmath36 or @xmath35 .",
    "the essence of the separatrix algorithmic map is in taking into account the alternations of the @xmath25 parameter .",
    "it alternates when the direction of motion alternates .",
    "this takes place either when rotation changes to libration , or when the motion is librational .",
    "algorithms  ( [ sam ] ) and ( [ sam1 ] ) do not contain the condition @xmath41 , because the direction of motion does not change when it holds .    in order to find expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ", one should integrate the increment of energy per one iteration of the map , following the usual procedure @xcite , but making it separately for prograde and retrograde directions of motion .",
    "this gives @xcite    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath27 and @xmath44 . the melnikov ",
    "arnold integral @xmath28 is given by equation  ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "the separatrix map theory can be used for analytical estimation of the maximum lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "comparisons of the predictions of this theory with numerical - experimental results can be found in @xcite and @xcite , where it was applied to various problems of celestial mechanics : rotational dynamics of planetary satellites , orbital dynamics of satellite systems , and orbital dynamics of asteroids .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent is defined by the limit    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the distance ( in phase space ) between two nearby initial conditions for two trajectories at the initial moment of time @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the distance between the evolved initial conditions at time @xmath49 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "according to the general approach used by @xcite , the maximum lyapunov exponent , @xmath50 , of the motion in the main chaotic layer of system given by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is represented as the ratio of the maximum lyapunov exponent , @xmath51 , of its separatrix map and the average period @xmath52 of rotation ( or , equivalently , the average half - period of libration ) of the resonance phase angle @xmath8 inside the layer : @xmath53 . in this way",
    ", formulas for the lyapunov time were derived in @xcite for four generic cases of interacting resonances : the fastly chaotic resonance triplet , fastly chaotic resonance doublet , slowly chaotic resonance triplet , and slowly chaotic resonance doublet ( called , respectively , `` ft , '' `` fd , '' `` st , '' and `` sd '' resonance multiplet types ) .    in the following sections , we shall need formulas for the lyapunov times for the `` fd '' and `` sd '' resonance types only .",
    "the formula for the lyapunov time for the `` fd '' resonance type is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is the period of perturbation .",
    "the quantities @xmath25 , @xmath51 , and @xmath57 are given by the formulas    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is chirikov s constant @xcite and @xmath62 is the base of natural logarithms .",
    "the formula for the lyapunov time for the `` sd '' resonance type is    @xmath63    @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 measures the separation of the perturbing and guiding resonances in the units of one quarter of the width of the guiding resonance , because the resonances separation in frequency space is equal to @xmath12 , while the guiding resonance width is equal to @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 can be regarded as a kind of the resonance overlap parameter . in the asymptotic limit of the adiabatic ( slow ) case",
    "the resonances in the multiplet strongly overlap , while in the asymptotic limit of the `` fast '' case the resonances are segregated .",
    "however note that the border @xmath66 @xcite between slow and fast chaos does not coincide with the borderline between the cases of overlapping and non - overlapping of resonances : the latter borderline lies much higher in @xmath22 .",
    "for example , in the phase space of the standard map the integer resonances start to overlap ( on decreasing @xmath22 ) at @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on the dynamical model of @xcite , constructed a hamiltonian of the motion in the solar neighborhood by adding the perturbations due to the bar and spiral arms to the unperturbed hamiltonian of the motion .",
    "namely , quillen s model describes interaction of the bar s 2:1 outer lindblad resonance with the spiral s 2:1 or 4:1 inner lindblad resonance .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has the form    @xmath68 \\label{hg}\\ ] ]    ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 23 ) ) ) . here ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are the conjugate momentum and phase variables ; @xmath71 ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath4 , and @xmath75 are free unitless parameters .",
    "the ranges for numerical values of the parameters were estimated in @xcite from observational physical and kinematical considerations .",
    "the frequency @xmath4 is counted in units of @xmath12 , and , accordingly , time is in units of @xmath76 ; here @xmath12 is the rotation rate of the epicyclic center .",
    "therefore , one time unit is equal to one galactic year at a given distance from the center of the milky way , divided by @xmath77 .    the first resonant term ( that with the coefficient @xmath73 ) in equation  ( [ hg ] ) corresponds to the perturbation due to the bar , while the second one ( that with the coefficient @xmath74 ) to the perturbation due to the spiral arms .",
    "the strength of the second term is much greater than that of the first one @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to perform a time - dependent shift @xmath78 of the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "this shift makes the second resonance explicitly the guiding one .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is    @xmath79    then we introduce the parameter @xmath80 and make a constant shift @xmath81 , @xmath82 , reducing equation  ( [ hg1 ] ) to the form    @xmath83    and expand the coefficients in the neighborhood of @xmath84 , leaving only the lowest order ( constant ) terms .",
    "this gives    @xmath85    thus we have reduced the perturbed `` second fundamental model for resonance '' ( called so by @xcite ) , given by the hamiltonian  ( [ hg ] ) , to the perturbed `` first fundamental model for resonance '' , given by the hamiltonian  ( [ hg3 ] ) , i.e. , to the perturbed pendulum model .",
    "this has turned out to be possible because the guiding resonance ( that emerging due to the spiral arms ) is bifurcated in all cases , the librational `` crescent '' , born from the bifurcation , being situated always quite far from the origin of the coordinate system ; see the phase space sections in figures  24 in @xcite , figure  3 in @xcite , and our figures  [ ps_section ] and [ ps_section_b ] .",
    "the phase space sections in figures  [ ps_section ] and [ ps_section_b ] have been constructed by numerical integration of the equations of motion with the hamiltonian  ( [ hg ] ) in the same way as described in @xcite ; the coordinates in the sections are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    in figure  [ ps_section ] , the phase space section for model  6 of group  c in @xcite is shown .",
    "it corresponds to figure  4  ( f ) in @xcite , except that we take here a much denser grid of initial data for the trajectories . in the case of figure  [ ps_section ] ,",
    "the value of @xmath75 is equal to @xmath88 , as in @xcite , while in the case of figure  [ ps_section_b ] the value of @xmath75 is chosen to be equal to zero . in both figures , the central regular island ( small crescent ) corresponds to the bar s resonance , while the outer regular island ( big crescent ) corresponds to the spiral s resonance . setting @xmath89 results mostly in a shift in the angular location of the spiral s resonance in @xmath70 ,",
    "that is why the relative angular orientation of the regular islands changes .",
    "the angular orientation of the center of the outer island ( the fixed point of the spiral s resonance ) changes by @xmath88 .",
    "apart from the change of the relative angular orientation of the regular islands , the phase space structure is qualitatively one and the same in figures .",
    "the value of @xmath75 does not influence the lyapunov and diffusion timescales , because this parameter can be removed by a simple canonical transformation , namely , a constant shift in time .",
    "the chaotic domain is pronounced in both figures .",
    "it emerges due to interaction of the bar s and spiral s resonances .",
    "the estimates of the lyapunov and diffusion times are made in what follows just for such domains , emerging due to interaction of the resonances , in various model sets .",
    "equation  ( [ hg3 ] ) describes the resonance duad , and , for estimating the lyapunov time of the motion in the chaotic layer , we can apply formulas ( [ tlfd ] ) and ( [ tlsd ] ) in the cases of fast and slow chaos , respectively .",
    "comparing the hamiltonians  ( [ h ] ) and ( [ hg3 ] ) , one has : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ; @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the results of calculation of the lyapunov times by formula ( [ tlfd ] ) ( when @xmath97 , i.e. , in the majority of cases ) and by formula ( [ tlsd ] ) ( when @xmath32 , only in two cases present ) are given in tables  1 , 2 , and 3 for model groups  a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "the model groups  a , b , and c correspond to the sets of parameter values considered for the construction of the phase space sections in figures  24 in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hg ] ) has five parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath4 , and @xmath75 .",
    "all of them are expressed by means of formulas given in @xcite through original dynamical characteristics of the galaxy and the solar neighborhood , such as the pattern speeds of the bar and spiral structure , the radius of the solar circle from the galactic center , the radius at which the bar ends , etc .",
    "these five parameters elude straightforward interpretation in terms of the original dynamical characteristics , but they have straightforward meaning in the framework of the dynamical model  ( [ hg ] ) : the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 characterize the strength of the bar s and spiral s resonances , respectively ; @xmath72 is the `` bifurcation control '' parameter , as discussed in @xcite ; @xmath4 measures the separation of the bar s and spiral s resonances in the frequency space ; @xmath75 is a phase shift , rather unimportant from the dynamical viewpoint , as discussed at the end of section  [ rh ] .",
    "the models 110 of each model group correspond to the panel of 10 poincar sections in a corresponding figure in @xcite : group  a corresponds to figure  2 , group  b to figure  3 , and group  c to figure  4 . the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants inside each model group .",
    "their values are given in the notes to the tables .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath4 vary inside each model group .",
    "the obtained values of the lyapunov time are all ( except in one case , corresponding to adiabatic chaos ) in the range from @xmath98 to @xmath99 time units .",
    "inspection of the data given in tables  13 also makes evident that the heuristic estimate @xmath100 @xcite severely underestimates the real lyapunov time ( by an order of magnitude in many cases ) . besides , it is rather seldom that the considered dynamical systems , modeling the dynamics in the solar neighborhood , can be called `` fully overlapped '' : the values of @xmath22 ( playing the role of the resonance overlap parameter , see section  [ minr ] ) are typically greater than 1/2 ; so , chaos is non - adiabatic",
    ".    only model  9 ( and , marginally , model  8) of model group  b can be called adiabatic .",
    "the values of the problem parameters @xmath74 , @xmath73 , @xmath4 , and @xmath72 in this case are such that the value of the separatrix map parameter @xmath22 is less than 1/2 .",
    "generally , the adiabaticity of chaos in any model can be checked by calculating @xmath101 , given the values of @xmath74 , @xmath73 , @xmath4 , and @xmath72 .",
    "as soon as our time unit is equal to one galactic year divided by @xmath77 , we see that the obtained typical lyapunov times are approximately equal to 10 galactic years .",
    "how much is it , in comparison with , e.g. , lyapunov times of the solar system bodies , in comparable time units ?",
    "the usual lyapunov times for asteroids in the main belt are 300010000  years or more @xcite , i.e. , they are @xmath102 asteroidal orbital periods or more , while the usual lyapunov times for highly eccentric comets are of the order of one cometary orbital period @xcite .",
    "so , the lyapunov times of the chaotic motion in the considered galactic model are much less ( by at least two orders of magnitude ) than the lyapunov times for the main belt asteroids , but an order of magnitude greater than for the comets , if expressed in adequate time units . in general terms of the loss of predictability of the motion ,",
    "the galactic dynamical chaos is rather strong .    from inspection of tables  13",
    "one can deduce that the lyapunov time depends on the model parameters rather weakly being almost of the same order in all the models .",
    "thus one can expect that choosing different values for the model parameters , such as relative strengths of the bar and spiral structures ( e.g. , choosing the spiral structure to be weaker ) , would not qualitatively change the typical lyapunov time value .",
    "however , note that the change of the model may radically reduce the extent of the chaotic domain .",
    "then chaos is not `` global '' and so the probability that the sun belongs to the chaotic domain of the phase space might be small .",
    "it is interesting that , as follows from the above estimates of @xmath103 , the age of the milky way measured in its lyapunov times is about 510 .",
    "this means that now it is already practically impossible to restore exact initial conditions for the stellar dynamics in the solar neighborhood from any observational data .",
    "let us estimate the characteristic times of chaotic transport ( called the diffusion times , when the diffusive approximation is used ) in the chaotic domain of the phase space in the same model set of @xcite .",
    "knowledge of these times will allow one to judge on the possibility for migration of the sun from the inner regions of the milky way to its current location .",
    "such a possibility , arising due to overlapping of resonances in the phase space , was advocated and studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite . to estimate the typical diffusion times",
    ", we shall base on the approach developed initially by @xcite for the purposes of studies in cometary dynamics .",
    "@xcite employed a similar approach in a study of the separatrix map dynamics ( see page 11 and , in particular , formulas  ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , a reservation should be made that it is only very approximate that we can consider the chaotic transport in the problem under study as diffusive .",
    "the matter is that the value of @xmath22 , as follows from tables  13 , in the majority of models is rather low : @xmath104 . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "when @xmath104 , ``  the layer width is reduced down to the size of a single kick .  hence , the diffusion approximation becomes inapplicable .",
    "instead , the so - called ballistic relaxation comes into play which is much quicker . in other words , a slow diffusive motion ",
    "is replaced now by rapid jumps of a trajectory over the whole layer  '' .",
    "( a `` single kick '' is the energy increment per iteration of the separatrix map . )",
    "therefore all the diffusion rate estimates that we make in this section should be regarded as extrapolation of diffusive description . in reality , they represent upper bounds for the real characteristic times of chaotic transport .    according to @xcite , the diffusion rate ( in the energy variable ) in the main chaotic layer in the phase space of the kepler map",
    "approximately equals the mean ( over time ) squared energy increment per iteration of this map .",
    "analogously , in the case of the ordinary separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) , the diffusion rate ( in the energy variable ) in the main chaotic layer in the phase space of the map approximately equals the mean squared energy increment , i.e. , @xmath105 . averaging over the interval @xmath106",
    ", we find the diffusion rate to be @xmath107 .    in the case of the separatrix algorithmic map ,",
    "the chaotic layer components corresponding to prograde rotations , retrograde rotations , and librations of the phase variable should be considered separately . in the two ( prograde and retrograde ) rotation cases the diffusion rate @xmath108 in the energy in the map phase space obviously equals @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the prograde and retrograde rotations ,",
    "respectively . employing the formulas for @xmath12 , @xmath111 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath22 , and @xmath112 , given at the beginning of section  [ lte ]",
    ", one can calculate the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the separatrix algorithmic map  ( [ sam ] ) . if @xmath97 , the equality @xmath113 implies @xmath114 , while @xmath115 implies @xmath116 .",
    "the component of the chaotic layer corresponding to reverse ( or direct ) rotations does not exist , if @xmath36 ( or , respectively , @xmath35 ) is equal to zero ; its measure is zero .",
    "the other circulation component with non - zero measure is described by the ordinary separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) with the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath117 ( the non - zero value among @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) ; its extent in @xmath20 is latexmath:[$\\approx \\lambda | w    @xcite ) .",
    "consider the libration component of the chaotic layer .",
    "then @xmath36 and @xmath35 alternate ( replace each other ) at each iteration of the separatrix algorithmic map  ( [ sam ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show @xcite that , if @xmath36 or @xmath35 is equal to zero , the separatrix algorithmic map  ( [ sam ] ) on the doubled iteration step reduces to the ordinary separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) with the doubled value of @xmath22 and the value of @xmath25 equal to a non - zero value of @xmath39 .",
    "taking into account that one iteration of the new map corresponds to two iterations of the original one , the diffusion rate referred to the original map time units is    @xmath119    where @xmath39 is the non - zero value among @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    for the circulation component of the layer",
    ", one has @xmath120",
    "( if @xmath94 ) or @xmath121 ( if @xmath122 ) .    as soon as the libration motion is reducible to the ordinary separatrix map  ( [ sm ] ) with the doubled value of @xmath22 , the layer s extent in @xmath20 on the side of librations doubles , it becomes @xmath123 .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath25 are considered here as independent from each other .",
    "therefore , the chaotic domain corresponding to libration dominates in extent , and for a rough estimate of the diffusion rate over the entire layer it is sufficient to make an estimate for the libration component alone .    in the case of the hamiltonian  ( [ hg3 ] ) @xmath113 and @xmath124 , so , @xmath125 , where    @xmath126    ( see equation  ( [ wplus ] ) ) , therefore    @xmath127    in the libration case .    to obtain the diffusion rate referred to real time units , it is necessary to transform the map time units into the real ones .",
    "this is performed by dividing the diffusion rate referred to map time units by the mean period of phase rotations ( half - periods of librations ) inside the chaotic layer , because this mean period is nothing but the average time interval corresponding to one map iteration .",
    "consequently , the diffusion rate referred to real time units is @xmath128 , where @xmath57 is given by formula  ( [ tsx ] ) .",
    "we define the characteristic diffusion time across the chaotic layer to be equal to the inverse of the diffusion rate .",
    "therefore , it is just the time needed for the diffusing particle to cover the relative energy interval equal to one .",
    "note that the maximum possible deviation in the relative energy @xmath20 from zero in the libration case is equal to @xmath129 @xcite ; therefore , the defined diffusion time gives an appropriate time estimate for the global mixing inside the chaotic layer , of course , if the chaotic layer is broad enough .    in our hamiltonian  ( [ hg3 ] ) @xmath94 , so , @xmath125 , and one gets for the diffusion time    @xmath130    where    @xmath131    ( see equation  ( [ tsx ] ) ) , @xmath62 is the base of natural logarithms , and @xmath35 is given by formula  ( [ wp ] ) .",
    "finally one has    @xmath132    in the case of the prograde rotation component of the chaotic layer , the diffusion rate @xmath120 ; therefore , the diffusion time is two times less than that given by formula  ( [ tdp ] ) .",
    "the results of the calculation of the diffusion times @xmath133 by formula  ( [ tdp ] ) are given in tables  4 , 5 , and 6 for model groups  a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "inspection of the data in tables  46 makes it evident that the diffusion times vary considerably inside the model groups : by as much as four orders of magnitude in group  c. taking into account that our time unit is equal to one galactic year divided by @xmath134 , i.e. , our time unit @xmath135  myr ( 1  myr @xmath136  year ; 1 galactic year @xmath137  myr ) , it is clear that the obtained diffusion times in most of the models with ordinal numbers up to three are greater than 10  gyr ( 1  gigayear @xmath138 1  gyr @xmath139  year ) , making large - scale radial chaotic migration improbable .",
    "such `` junior '' models all have positive values of @xmath72 .",
    "however , models  79 in group b also have large values of @xmath140 .",
    "@xcite found in detailed numerical experiments that , due to the resonance overlap of the bar and spiral structure , the galactic disk mixes in about 3 gyr . from our tables",
    "46 it is obvious ( taking into account that our time unit @xmath135  myr ) that most of the models with negative values of @xmath72 provide chaotic mixing effective enough to be consistent with the numerical - experimental results of @xcite .",
    "almost all models with large ordinal numbers , except models  79 in group b , permit such migration .",
    "generally , as follows from data in tables  46 , the diffusion rate strongly depends on the radial position in the galaxy .",
    "note that the hamiltonian model  ( [ hg ] ) assumes that the guiding radius in the unperturbed dynamics is fixed .",
    "if migration is present , the guiding radius varies ; so , a more refined model should be used to account for this variation self - consistently .",
    "one should also mention that chaotic transport can be ubiquitous in the galaxy , though its dynamical origin is presumably different from that considered here .",
    "@xcite showed that the diffusion might occur in many regions due to interaction of multiple waves , and so overlapping of resonances should be common ; besides , if the bar slows down ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) resonances can sweep through the galaxy @xcite .",
    "of course , these processes can not be described in the specific dynamical model considered here , but this model already provides an insight into the possible effectiveness of chaotic transport in the galaxy .",
    "the most important conclusion of this section is that models that permit large - scale radial chaotic migration of the sun ( from the inner regions of the milky way to its current location ) do exist .",
    "this confirms the dynamical possibility of the migration concept advocated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "what is more , due to the possibility of ballistic flights mentioned in the beginning of this section , the chaotic mixing might be far more effective and quicker than in the case of normal diffusion . obviously , the effect of ballistic relaxation should be explored in detail in the future .",
    "we have considered how the lyapunov and diffusion timescales of the stellar dynamics in the solar neighborhood can be estimated .",
    "we have used quillen s ( 2003 ) model to describe interaction of the `` spiral '' and `` bar '' nonlinear resonances in the phase space of the motion .",
    "a method of analytical estimation of the maximum lyapunov exponents of the orbital motion has been applied to the solar neighborhood dynamics .",
    "the analytical treatment has been performed within a framework of the separatrix map theory @xcite , describing the motion near the separatrices of a perturbed nonlinear resonance .",
    "the lyapunov times turn out to be basically in the range from 6 to 13 galactic years . in comparison with the lyapunov times of the solar system bodies ( made in adequate time units ) ,",
    "the galactic dynamical chaos is rather strong in general terms of the loss of predictability of the motion .",
    "an interesting inference is that , as soon as the age of the milky way measured in its lyapunov times is about 510 , now it is already practically impossible to restore exact initial conditions for the stellar dynamics in the solar neighborhood from any observational data .",
    "we have estimated also the diffusion times , based on the approach developed initially by @xcite for the purposes of studies in cometary dynamics .",
    "we have found that , in a number of models , the diffusion times turn out to be small enough to permit radial chaotic migration of the sun from the inner regions of the milky way to its current location . in other words ,",
    "dynamically adequate models that permit large - scale radial chaotic migration do exist .",
    "this confirms the dynamical possibility of the migration concept advocated by @xcite and @xcite . due to the possibility of ballistic flights inside the chaotic layer , arising because @xmath104",
    ", the chaotic mixing might be even far more effective and quicker than in the case of normal diffusion .",
    "we have shown that only in a narrow range of possible values of the problem parameters @xmath74 , @xmath73 , @xmath4 , and @xmath72 the galactic chaos is adiabatic because the values of the separatrix map parameter @xmath22 , playing the role of the resonance overlap parameter , are typically greater than 1/2 ; in other words , adiabatic chaos ( @xmath32 ) seems to be not characteristic for the dynamics in the solar neighborhood ."
