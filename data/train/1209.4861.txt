    "in observational astrophysics , and in particular focusing in imaging acquisition through the optical window , the data treatment is fundamental to minimize the influence of data acquisition imperfections on the estimation of the desired astronomical measurements ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for this purpose ,",
    "image flat - fielding and sky subtraction constitute two of the most common and important reduction steps .",
    "an inadequate flat - fielding or sky subtraction easily leads to the introduction of systematic uncertainties in the data .",
    "therefore , the observation of blank fields ( bfs ) , defined as regions of the sky that are devoid of stars down to a given threshold magnitude ( @xmath0 ) , is a very important aspect in astronomical observations . in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) , we have already discussed in detail the relevance of bfs in astronomical observations , and we refer the interested reader to the introduction of that paper .    in paper",
    "i , we presented the first systematic all - sky catalogue of bfs so far .",
    "the method used to identify the bfs was based on the delaunay triangulation on the surface of a sphere , using stars brighter than 11 mag taken from the @xcite catalogue as the nodes for triangulation .",
    "in addition , a new virtual observatory ( vo ) tool named tesela , accessible through the internet , was created so that users can retrieve , and visualize , the bfs available near a given position in the sky .",
    "another commonly used resource is the collection by marco azzarometeodat / blanks.htm ] , consisting of a short list of 38 bfs voids of stars up to 1016 mag .",
    "although , in general , deeper than the bfs of paper  i , these are very few , and most of them are in the northern hemisphere ; there are only a few with negative declination , and none bellow @xmath1 .",
    "so , this bf collection is not well suited for telescopes located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "nevertheless , even the azzaro bfs have been shown to be shallow for large - class telescopes .",
    "for example , in the case of the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , a 10-m class telescope , equipped with the optical system for imaging and low resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris , @xcite ) , it is usually necessary to have access to bfs free of stars down to 17.5 mag .",
    "this requirement will be even more demanding for the future generation of telescopes , such as european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "one method of identifying low - populated fields is to use a binned - up smoothed map of the distribution of the stars in the sky . in this method , it is necessary to divide the sky in small patches and to identify those with few , or even no stars , down to a threshold magnitude .",
    "however , with this method , a bf would not be identified unless the patch was well centered on the region free of stars .",
    "in addition , the size of the bf would not be the maximum possible because it is arbitrarily defined .",
    "thus , the procedure should be repeated many times with both a different centring scheme and a different patch radius ; this would be very demanding with respect to cpu time .",
    "these two drawbacks can be overcome with the sky tessellation method we have developed , which has been extensively described in paper  i.    thus , in this work we have applied delaunay triangulation to the usno - b catalog of the united states naval observatory , we have generated acatalogue of deep blank fields ( dbfs ) to varying limiting magnitudes from 15 to 18 in steps of 1 mag . in order to validate our method , we have tested some dbfs found at the gtc and we have compared these with the bfs in azzaro catalogue .",
    "finally , in order to facilitate the use of this new catalogue , we have incorporated it into tesela , which now provides a simple interface that allows the user to retrieve the list of either the bfs from or the dbfs from available near a given position in the sky .    in section  [ section : catalogues ] , we describe the method used to create the catalogues , the defects found in the  catalog and the results of the tessellation . section  [ section : gtc ] , we describe the use of the dbfs catalogue on the gtc . and , finally , in section  [ section : tesela ] , we describe the implementation of tesela .",
    "the delaunay triangulation @xcite consists of the subdivision of a geometric object ( e.g.  a surface or a volume ) into a set of simplices . in particular , for the euclidean planar ( two - dimensional ) case , given a set of points , also called nodes , delaunay triangulation becomes a subdivision of the plane into triangles , whose vertexes are nodes . for each of these triangles , it is possible to determine its associated circumcircle , which is the circle passing exactly through the three vertices of the triangle .",
    "interestingly , in a delaunay triangulation , all the triangles satisfy the empty circumcircle interior property , which means that all the circumcircles are empty ( i.e. there are no nodes inside any of the computed circumcircles ) .",
    "see paper  i for an extended description of the method .",
    "delaunay triangulation can be applied to the two - dimensional surface of a three - dimensional celestial sphere , using as nodes the locations of the stars down to a given @xmath0 .",
    "then , the empty circumcircle interior property of the delaunay triangulation provides a straightforward method for a systematic search of regions void of stars brighter than a certain magnitude .    in this work we applied the delaunay triangulation to the sources of the  catalog @xcite .",
    "the  catalog contains astrometric and photometric information for more than a billion stars and galaxies in the sky .",
    "the data were taken from various sky surveys over 50 years , and it is expected to be complete up to magnitude _ v _  =  21  mag .",
    "typical uncertainties are 200  mas for the positions at j2000 and 0.3  mag in photometry .",
    "photometric data consists of _ v , r _ , and _",
    "i _ optical passbands .",
    "we used the _",
    "r _ band ( between 600 and 750 nm ) as the magnitude reference . for most of the sources",
    ", the  catalog provides the _ r _ magnitude ( @xmath2 ) at two different epochs . to assign a single @xmath2 to these objects , either we have averaged out both @xmath2 when their values are similar ( @xmath3@xmath41 ) or selected the lower value ( i.e. , the brightest value ) when there is a larger difference .    in principle , it is straightforward to obtain a list of bfs for the whole celestial sphere by using as input a stellar catalogue including stars down to a given magnitude .",
    "however , as explained in paper  i , because of the exponential growth of the number of objects with increasing limiting magnitude , tessellating the whole sky with @xmath0 above 11 mag requires too many computer resources ( in form of memory and computing time ) , even with the approach of subdividing the sky into many smaller subregions .    therefore , to create the dbfs catalogue ,",
    "we have followed a methodology that is different from the one adopted in paper  i. instead of tessellating the whole sky at once , we used the following workflow .",
    "( i ) we selected all bfs with a size larger than 10 , using the deepest catalogue available at that moment .",
    "( ii ) we individually tessellated each of these regions , as in paper  i , using the positions of the  objects down to a @xmath0 as the nodes of the triangulation .",
    "( iii ) to create the new dbfs catalogue , from the new collection of deeper bfs we selected those with a size larger than 10 .",
    "( iv ) we repeated the whole process , increasing @xmath0 from 15 to 18 in steps of 1 mag .    the initial collection of bfs was obtained from paper  i , consisting of bfs void of stars down to 11 mag in both passbands .",
    "this provided initial regions with a size larger than 10 .",
    "this size was selected to ensure that the regions were always larger than the field of view of the osiris instrument used at the gtc ( see sect.[section : gtc ] ) .",
    "tessellating this huge number of initial regions requires months of execution time . in order to obtain the results as soon as possible so they could be used in the nightly operation of the gtc , we proceeded with the northern ( dec@xmath5@xmath630@xmath7 ) sky in strips 1 h wide in ra . when the tessellation of the northern sky was finished , we tessellated the southern ( dec@xmath8@xmath630@xmath7 ) sky in the same way .",
    "finally we merged all dbfs found in one catalogue .",
    "it was very common that the tessellation process identified two overlaping dbfs which centers were separated by less than 0.3 times the smaller dbf radius .",
    "although both dbfs are correct , the two refer to almost the same region of the sky .",
    "thus , to facilitate the use of the catalogue , we removed the dbf with the smaller radius from the catalogue , retaining the one with the larger size .",
    "a final evaluation of each dbf of the catalogue was made .",
    "we counted the total number of stars inside the dbf with both @xmath2 lower than 17.5 mag ( a requirement of the gtc ; see section[section : gtc ] ) and lower than 22.0 mag . then , we estimated the integrated _ r _ flux ( @xmath9 ) as the sum of the individual fluxes of all star in the dbf with @xmath2@xmath422.0mag .",
    "these quantities provided a measurement of the depth of the dbf .    to verify the validity of the method , and taking advantage of the aladin software @xcite , we visually checked all the 79 dbfs of 18 @xmath0 found previously in order to give them to the operation staff of the gtc",
    ". this vo tool allows users to visualize and analyse digitized astronomical images , and superimpose entries from astronomical catalogues or data bases available from the vo services . using aladin",
    ", we displayed the dss - red images of the dbf region and we superimposed the  data of the region .",
    "this exercise was very useful in the detection of unknown defects in the  catalog ( see sect.[section : defects ] ) .",
    "of the 79 dbfs , 5 corresponded to a dark cloud , so they were removed from the final catalogue .",
    "similarly , we removed any dbfs corresponding to the same dark cloud of any @xmath0 .",
    "the  catalog was constructed from photographic plates , taken from several different surveys , which were uniformly scanned , and whose sources were extracted in an automatic way from the scanned data .",
    "the original plate images contained many defects and artifacts that logically affected the final  data .",
    "that said , so far there is no other full sky catalogue deep enough for our project .",
    "so , the  catalog was our best option , even with its known defects .",
    "because we have used the  catalog as the input for the tesellation process , our dbf catalogue was affected by the defects of the  catalog .",
    "although we have made an effort to minimise the damage , we can not completely guarantee the absence of misidentification in our final dbf catalogue .",
    "so , the user should confirm the validity of the dbfs before using them .",

    "this high density of dbfs reflects an abnormally high value of the @xmath2 in the  catalog , probably because of a wrong photometric calibration of the photographic plates . in fig.[usno_avsb ] we show a comparison between usno - a _ rmag _ and  _ r1mag _ and _ r2mag _ of the objects in common in a small region of the sky where abnormally high density of dbfs was found .",
    "the values of  _ r1mag _ and _ r2mag _ are usually more than 7 mag higher than those of usno - a _ rmag_. thus , the dbfs found on this region were clearly unreliable .",
    "then , we defined four rectangular regions ( see table[usnoa ] ) covering the areas with an abnormally high density of dbfs and used the usno - a catalog in the tessellation instead of  catalog .",

    "thus , these spurious entries might have decreased the number of dbfs , but they have never introduced unreal dbf detections .    30  image centered at vega.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    , where @xmath14 is the maximum region around the bright object where star density is determined .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the method is the assumption that the stellar density in the annulus between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is roughly constant.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     confidence limits in a normal distribution).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    however , there are other defects in the  catalog that could affect our tessellation process in a worse way . in fig.[defect2 ] , we show the  catalog entries around vega , which is one of the brightest stars of our sky . the brightest stars ( @xmath47 mag )",
    "are surrounded by a circular halo in the plate images , caused by internal reflections in the camera .",
    "consequently , the regions around the brightest stars in the  catalog are artificial regions that are void - of - stars , and in many cases these have been wrongly identified as dbfs .    with the help of the scripting capabilities of aladin , we have estimated the radius of the region devoid of neighbour stars around each of the  stars down to .",
    "for that purpose ( see fig.[mide_circles ] ) , we consider that around the bright stars there is a region devoid of stars up to a radius @xmath15 .",
    "the automatic determination of this parameter is not difficult if we assume that the stellar density beyond this radius , and up to @xmath14 ( which , in our case was set to 30 ) , is constant . under this circumstance , it is easy to show that the number of stars within a radius @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 ) is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total number of neighbouring stars in the annulus between @xmath15 and @xmath14 . because we were interested in obtaining an automatic and robust estimation of @xmath15 , we have followed an approach based on the incomplete method of thail ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as with most non - parametric procedures , all the objects in the field ( within @xmath14 ) were first sorted in ascending order using the distance from the central bright star .",
    "this provided a collection of @xmath21 points of coordinates @xmath22 where @xmath23 . here",

    "this criterion was not applied to the dbf with 18 @xmath0 , because they were all visually inspected .",
    "the percentages of removed dbfs are 1 , 2 , and 9% for 15 , 16 , and 17 @xmath0 , respectively . as expected , the percentage increases with @xmath0 because the number of wrong dbfs should be similar for all catalogues .",

    "the integrated flux @xmath43 is in column 10 .",
    "the last four columns 1114 give the galactic extincition @xmath44 as described below .",
    "there are some regions at the southern hemisphere where no dbfs have been found .",
    "some of these dbfs have been validated with the gtc and are they are regularly used in the nightly operation of the telescope ( see section[section : gtc ] ) .",
    "although our main goal in this work was to provide a list of dbfs for data calibration , the dbfs found can also be used for other interesting purposes ( e.g. deep pencil - beam extragalactic surveys ) . in this sense ,",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of the sky where the dbfs are located is useful information that would help in the identification of suitable dbfs .",
    "thus , we used the galactic dust reddening and extinction utility of the nasa/ ipac infrared science archive to estimate the galactic extinction from @xcite for each dbf in our catalogue . in this way",
    ", five new parameters were added to the catalogue : @xmath44 at the center of the dbf , the average @xmath44 in the sky region defined by the dbf , together with its standard deviation , and the maximum and minimum @xmath44 in this sky area .",
    "we have used the 10.4 m gtc , located at observatorio roque de los muchachos in la palma ( orm ) , canary islands , spain , as a test - bed for the validation of our dbfs .",
    "the telescope is currently equipped for scientific exploitation with the osiris optical facility , which includes imaging with broad - band filters from the sloan set ( @xmath45 ) , as well as a very flexible set of narrow - band filters that can be used when requested .",
    "the osiris instrument consists of a mosaic of two marconi ccd detectors , each with 2048@xmath104096 pixels and a total unviggnetted field of view of 7.8@xmath107.8 , giving a plate scale of 0.127/pix . for this reason ,",
    "the series of bfs requested for the nightly operation of the instrument must be at least 10wide , it must be larger than the osiris field of view , and it must also take into account the dithering between consecutive exposures that is usually performed to eliminate the contribution of the stars in producing the final flat - field image .    to date , the most comprehensive list of bfs available for observations carried out at the orm has been the collection made by azzaro .",
    "however , the large aperture of the gtc means that these fields ( which are empty up to magnitudes 1016 ) are too shallow to be used as bfs for the gtc , because they appear relatively full of stars once an osiris / gtc image is obtained .    during the nightly operation of osiris / gtc ,",
    "an automatic script is used to obtain a series of broad - band flat - field images in sloan @xmath46 filters ( sloan @xmath47 filter is of rare use ) . because of the particularities of the osiris shutter , in order to obtain a photometric accuracy better than 0.1% in the images , exposure times of the order of 12 s are needed . to define the limiting magnitude for the bfs to be used at the gtc , a complete set of azzaro fields",
    "was observed over nearly a year of operation at the telescope , and were reduced photometrically to determine the magnitude of the detected stars under good photometric conditions . for 12",
    "s of exposure time , in sloan @xmath17 filter , and with nearly 30000 adus of sky background level ( which represents half of the full well of the detector ) , stars as faint as 17.518.0 mag ( depending on the seeing conditions ) were detected .",
    "this is the fainter limit that we have imposed on the bfs to be used with osiris / gtc , which might be empty regions of the sky up to @xmath48 mag .",
    "this is impossible to achieve with the azzaro catalogue .",
    "in addition , for operating reasons , those bfs should provide a complete ra coverage .",
    "these two constraints are very restrictive , but they can sometimes be met using our dbf catalogue .",
    "thus , we have been able to create a list of 87 dbfs that can be used with osiris / gtc , although it was not always possible to archive the @xmath0 limit .",
    "this list provides at least one of these dbfs both at the beginning or at the end of every night of the year , which is extremely useful for the calibration of the scientific data delivered by osiris instrument .",
    "this list has superseded the azzaro catalogue in the nightly operation of the telescope .",
    "some of the dbfs selected can be found in tables[northdbfs ]",
    ". there is an evident advantage to using the new dbfs rather than those from the azzaro collection , because they have been shown to be much better . in fig.[bfs ] , we show a comparison of one of the dbfs used at the gtc with another one from the azzaro catalogue .",
    "in order to provide easy access to the dbf catalogue , we have incorporated it into tesela , a web accessible tool , developed within the spanish virtual observatory , which can be publicly accessed from http://sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/tesela .",
    "the tool was implemented with a data base containing the new computed dbf regions from the  catalog .",
    "thus , through an user - friendly interface , the user can now perform a cone - search around a position in the sky in either the bf catalogue from ( see paper  i for a extended description ) or the dbf catalogue from  catalog . through the search form for the dbf catalogue",
    ", users can select the @xmath0 and the search radius .",
    "the cone - search can be made in either equatorial or galactic coordinates .",
    "tesela presents the result of the cone - search in a table containing the same main properties of the dbfs presented in tables[northdbfs ] .",
    "this table can be downloaded in csv format for further use .",
    "tesela also provides users with the possibility of visualizing the data . to do this , tesela takes advantage of aladin . thanks to this connection with aladin , we have provided the user with the full capacity and power of the vo . using this aladin window ,",
    "users are allowed to load images and catalogues both locally and from the vo , having full access to the whole universe resident in the vo .",
    "this can be very helpful to determine the potential influence of relatively bright nebulae and extragalactic sources in the regions sought .",
    "tesela sends to aladin the searching area , which is plotted in the first plane with a red circle , and the dbfs , which are shown by blue circles in a second layer .",
    "the size of the blue circles corresponds with the size of the dbfs . finally , aladin charges from the vo in a last layer the objects of ngc  2000.0 ( complete new general catalogue and index catalogue of nebulae and star clusters ; @xcite ) .",

    "<S> the observation of blank fields , defined as regions of the sky that are devoid of stars down to a given threshold magnitude , constitutes one of the most relevant calibration procedures required for the proper reduction of astronomical data obtained following typical observing strategies . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have used the delaunay triangulation to search for deep blank fields throughout the whole sky , with a minimum size of 10  in diameter and an increasing threshold magnitude from 15 to 18 in the _ r _ band of the usno - b catalog of the united states naval observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a catalogue with the deepest blank fields known so far . </S>",
    "<S> a short sample of these regions has been tested with the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias , and it has been shown to be extremely useful for medium and large size telescopes . because some of the regions found could also be suitable for new extragalactic studies , we have estimated the galactic extinction in the direction of each deep blank field . this catalogue is accessible through the virtual observatory tool tesela , and the user can retrieve - and visualize using aladin - the deep blank fields available near a given position in the sky .    </S>",
