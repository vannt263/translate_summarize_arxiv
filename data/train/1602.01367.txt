    "lasers are the standard sources of coherent light with a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "their basic components are a resonator that stores photons and selects particular modes , an optically active medium that emits photons coherently into the resonator by stimulated emission , and a pumping process that establishes a population inversion in the medium @xcite .",
    "a large variety of systems can serve as optically active medium .",
    "this includes natural atoms or semiconductor devices @xcite , but further systems have been proposed and studied experimentally .",
    "these include strongly coupled single or few josephson qubits @xcite and semiconductor quantum dot systems @xcite . in these setups ,",
    "the low number of atoms is compensated by strong coupling .",
    "their frequencies are in the ghz regime , accordingly they are sometimes called `` maser '' instead of laser .",
    "these systems may find useful applications , e.g. , as miniaturized on - chip sources of coherent microwaves in low temperature experiments .",
    "there are other on - chip microwave sources which have been studied , including voltage - biased josephson junctions @xcite or nonlinear resonators close to the quantum regime @xcite",
    ". however these devices emit incoherent radiation unless driven by a coherent microwave source .",
    "lasing devices based on qubits also show unconventional properties , such as dressed - state lasing @xcite or photon - number squeezed light @xcite .",
    "so far , experimental realizations of lasers based on superconducting or quantum dot qubits have only used single or few artificial atoms . a way to reach higher output power is to increase the number @xmath0 of atoms , e.g. by using superconducting quantum metamaterials .",
    "such materials with @xmath1 qubits have already been produced and studied @xcite .",
    "a drawback of using solid - state circuits is the fact that they invariably suffer from disorder , either due to the variations in the fabrication process or in the environment . as a result , the level - splitting @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and hence the detuning from the resonator frequency @xmath4 , as well as other parameters such as the coupling strength to the resonator or the local driving , vary for different artificial atoms .",
    "we therefore examine the influence of this ( quasi - static ) disorder on the multi - atom lasing .",
    "our analysis reveals that the lasing process is rather robust against disorder over a wide range of disorder variances .",
    "the origin of this effect is the following : those atoms which are above the lasing threshold , e.g. , close enough to resonance , start emitting photons into the resonator .",
    "these photons enhance the process of stimulated emission , which is proportional to their number @xmath5 , also for atoms which are still below the threshold . hence these atoms start participating in the lasing process , and @xmath5 grows further . in parallel to this growth , also the range of parameters such as detuning or coupling strength which are sufficient for lasing increases .    in this paper , we will study the effects of disorder in the detuning , the coupling strength , and the pumping strength of the individual atoms on the photon number and the lasing thresholds . after presenting the model and the basic relations",
    ", we first compare the single- and the multi - atom setups of an ordered system . at this stage",
    "we observe already the increase of the allowed range of detuning and reduced requirement on the coupling strength . in the next sections",
    "quantitative results are presented for a gaussian and a box distribution of the disorder in the various parameters . since probably most experiments in the near future",
    "will be carried out with not too large numbers of atoms ( @xmath6 ) one should expect significant sample - specific deviations from the average behavior .",

    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : nodisordertotalfigure ] also illustrate a remarkable scaling relation @xcite , namely @xmath45 the scaling relation , combined with eqs .   and , displays the following properties : ( i ) in the lasing state the number of photons @xmath46 grows linearly with the number of atoms @xmath0 , ( ii ) for different @xmath0 we obtain the same qualitative dependence on the coupling strength provided that it is rescaled as @xmath47 , ( iii ) we furthermore note that the width of the resonance as function of detuning increases with the number of atoms proportional to @xmath48 . in other words , for a fixed coupling strength , a system with many atoms can tolerate a stronger detuning and still show a transition to the lasing state than a single - atom laser .",
