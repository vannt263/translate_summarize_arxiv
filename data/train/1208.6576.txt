    "it is well established that not all radio pulsars emit radiation during each rotation . backer ( 1970 ) first observed this phenomenon and demonstrated that some pulsars exist in a `` null state '' for several pulse periods before switching back on again .",
    "pulsar nulling has been investigated extensively over the years ( e.g. , ritchings 1976 ; rankin 1986 ; biggs 1992 ) . from a study of pulsars in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ;",

    "2001 ) , wang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) confirmed earlier evidence ( ritchings 1976 ) that the fraction of nulling pulses generally increases with increasing characteristic age .",
    "in addition to the nulling phenomenon , it has become apparent that a new class of intermittent pulsars exist where no radiation is observed over much longer time - scales . in a single - pulse analysis of archival pmps data ,",
    "mclaughlin et al .  ( 2006 ) discovered a new class of neutron stars ( rotating radio transients ) from which radio emission is detectable , on average , only 1  s per day in an apparently random fashion . in the same year , kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported the discovery of a more deterministic type of intermittency in psr  b1931 + 24 , which appears to be the prototype of a large population of pulsars that have so far been difficult to detect .",
    "as kramer et al .  demonstrated , psr  b1931 + 24 shows a quasi - periodic on / off cycle with a period of 3040 days in which the spindown rate increases by @xmath2% when the pulsar is in its on - state compared to the off - state . in this paper , we report observations characterizing intermittent behavior in psr  j1832 + 0029  an apparently ordinary 533-ms pulsar with a characteristic age of 5.6  myr which was discovered as part of the pmps ( lorimer et al .",

    "like b1931 + 24 , the spindown rate in the on - state is higher than the off - state .",
    "for j1841@xmath00500 the increase is approximately 150% !",
    "these pulsars are dramatic examples of a newly recognized and large group of pulsars which show changes in their emission properties and period derivatives @xcite which are correlated and often quasi - periodic . understanding pulsar intermittency",
    "will shed new insights into neutron star physics and populations .",
    "the long off - states of intermittent pulsars are in stark contrast to the longest known quiescence times of nulling pulsars , i.e.  they exceed the typical nulling time scale by about five orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the observed increase in spindown rate points to a significant increase in the magnetospheric particle outflow when the pulsar switches on , indicating that a pulsar wind plays a significant role in neutron star spin evolution . as described by kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and discussed later in this paper , the spindown rate changes allow us to estimate the current density associated with the radio emission .",
    "the difficulties in detecting and identifying intermittent pulsars imply that the few we currently observe represent a potentially substantial population of similar objects in the galaxy . to better understand this population ,",
    "it is therefore important to establish the related time - scales for the non - emitting state .",
    "here we detail our observations of intermittent behavior in psr  j1832 + 0029 . in  [ sec : radio ] we describe the radio observations we have carried out to characterize its intermittency . in  [ sec : xray ] we describe the _ chandra _ x - ray observations which constrain the high - energy emission from the pulsar . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "psr  j1832 + 0029  was first detected during the pmps in an observation made on 2000 november 23 . following its confirmation observation in 2003 september as part of follow - up observations for the survey ( lorimer et al .",
    "2006 ) , psr  j1832 + 0029  has been observed regularly by both the parkes 64-m and lovell 76-m radio telescopes .",
    "parkes observations span the period from 2004 september until 2008 september .",
    "lovell observations began in 2006 march and continue to be made . to date , a total of 422 individual detections of the pulsar have been collected ( 331 of these with the lovell telescope ) .",
    "the initial parkes observations provided routine detections of the pulsar at 1374 and 1518 mhz in five minute pointings until 2004 may . despite 27 observations of the pulsar between 2004 june 26 and 2006 january 7 , the pulsar was not detected . by 2005 march",
    ", the parkes observation times had increased to 20 minutes .",
    "the non - detections mean that the flux density of psr j1832 + 0029  must have been less than 70  @xmath3jy during the period 2004 may to 2005 february for the 5-minute observations and below 40  @xmath3jy for the 20-min observations carried out between 2005 march and 2006 january .",
    "the pulsar was finally detected again on 2006 march 3 in a 20-min observation at 1374  mhz .",
    "it was subsequently routinely detectable , primarily with the lovell telescope , until 2010 april 7 , after which it became undetectable until 2012 july 20 when it resumed its regular behavior .    in all of the observations in which the pulsar was detected",
    ", we find no evidence for any variation in the pulse width ( 7.1  ms full - width at half maximum ) or flux density ( 140  @xmath3jy ) as originally presented in lorimer et al .",
    "currently our parkes and lovell observations provide only modest constraints on the degree of polarization in psr  j1832 + 0029  and indicate that it is less than 20% linearly polarized . as we discuss later (  [ sec : magnetosphere ] ) , sensitive observations of this pulsar s polarimetric properties could be valuable in helping to discriminate between various proposed models    to make the most stringent constraints of psr  j1832 + 0029  during its off - state , on 2011 march 8 and 9 we carried out two 1-hr observations using the 305-m william e. gordon arecibo radio telescope .",
    "both observations were conducted using the l - band wide receiverastro / rxstatus / lwide / lwide.shtml ] and the wideband arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps ; dowd et al .",
    "four wapps were used to measure three - level autocorrelation functions every 128  @xmath3s in each of four 100-mhz sub - bands spanning 11001500  mhz .",
    "the data from each wapp were fourier transformed using the filterbank program within the sigproc software package to synthesize a filterbank with 512 frequency channels , each of width 781.25  khz .",
    "these channelized data were then dedispersed at the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) of 28.3 @xmath4  pc and folded over a range of trial periods around the nominal value predicted by our timing model using sigproc s fold program .",
    "a blind periodicity search was also carried out using sigproc s seek program down to a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 6 .",
    "psr  j1832 + 0029  was not detected in either of these analyses .",
    "assuming an average gain of 8.5  k / jy which is appropriate for the large zenith angles during the observation ( 1720 degrees ) , these s / n limits in the searching and folding analyses translate to an upper limit on the flux of 23  @xmath3jy in each observation .",
    "folding the data coherently across both days also resulted in no detection , with a corresponding upper limit of 1.6  @xmath3jy . at its nominal on - state flux density of 140  @xmath3jy",
    ", the pulsar would have been detected with s / n of approximately 440 .",
    "we can therefore constrain any emission in the off - state to be less than one part in 440 of the flux density in the on - state . at the distance",

    "this limit is a factor of 16 lower than that inferred for the off - state of psr b1931 + 24 ( kramer et al .",

    ", we attempted to improve absolute astrometry by cross - correlation of the acis positions of field x - ray sources with their possible counterparts in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog , using the reproject_aspect script . because of the small number of plausible matches between the x - ray and 2mass sources ( e.g. , 6 sources with @xmath8 separation , within @xmath9 from the aim point ) , the correction turned out to be substantially dependent on the choice of sources .",
    "we chose four 2mass sources with likely x - ray counterparts on the s3 chip ( separations @xmath10 ) for each of the observations , which resulted in 03 and 02 corrections in the pulsar s position for the first and second observations , respectively ( i.e. , less than the size of the acis pixel , 0492 ) .",

    "the detected numbers of source and background counts in the source aperture are @xmath22 and 3 , for the first and second observations , respectively ( the same as in the uncorrected images ) .",
    "this means that the pulsar was not detected in our observations , and we can only put upper limits on its count rate and flux . assuming poisson statistics , the upper limit @xmath23 on the total number of counts in the detection area at confidence level @xmath24 can be estimated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the source count rate upper limits at the 99% confidence level are therefore @xmath32 counts s@xmath33 for the first observation and @xmath34 counts s@xmath33 for the second observation .",
    "the radio observations reported above suggest long - term intermittent behavior in psr  j1832 + 0029 , while the x - ray observations failed to detect any difference in the high - energy emission between the on- and off - states .",
    "we now discuss the implications of these observations .      to track the variation in spin frequency ( @xmath35 ) of psr  j1832 + 0029  we used the tempo2 software package ( hobbs et al .",
    "2006 ) and its stridefit plugin to carry out measurements of @xmath35 based on timing model fits to short ( 30-day time span ) segments of data in which the position was fixed at the nominal values found by lorimer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the spin frequency derivative @xmath36 was assumed to be zero . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spindown ] , this analysis reveals a clear discontinuity in the spindown behavior during the off - states .",
    "two explanations could account for this : ( i ) the pulsar suffered a period glitch during the off - states ; ( ii ) the spindown rate was different during the off - states , as is observed for psrs  b1931 + 24 and j1841@xmath00500 .",
    "although it is possible to fit across the 20042005 period , resulting in @xmath37 for the putative glitch , no exponential recovery is observed and the abrupt turn - off observed in emission is inconsistent with other observations of glitching pulsars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached for the 20102012 off - state .",
    "henceforth we examine the hypothesis where the spindown rate of psr  j1832 + 0029  has two distinct values which we refer to as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    using tempo2",
    ", we obtained independent timing solutions in each of the two on - states .",
    "the results of these analyses are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the pulsar s dm was not constrained by these analyses and was therefore held fixed at the value reported by lorimer et al .",
    "( 2006 ; dm = 28.3  @xmath4  pc ) .",
    "the shorter timing baseline ( @xmath40  days ) for the first on - state compared to the second one ( @xmath41  yr ) means that the timing parameters obtained from it are less precise and subject to covariances .",
    "so far , we have only sampled @xmath42  month in the current ( third ) on - state . to minimize these covariances , we held the position in the first on - state fit fixed at the position derived from the second on - state .",
    "while the post - fit residuals for the first on - state are approximately white , a significant amount of timing noise is present in the residuals from the second on - state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] . this behavior can be removed by fitting multiple sinusoids to the data ( the `` harmonic whitening '' technique ; hobbs et al .",

    "the residuals can be whitened by removing six harmonically related sinusoids and the result fit parameters are all within 1-@xmath43 of the values presented in table 1 .",
    "we therefore adopt the parameters from the second on - state as being our most precise measurements of the pulsar to date and , hence , @xmath44  s@xmath19 .    to measure @xmath39 , we accounted for the uncertainties in off / on switching epochs in the following way .",
    "we first assumed that the nominal switch - off epoch ( @xmath45 ) of the pulsar occured midway between the date of the last detection during the second on - phase ( @xmath46  mjd 55293.33 ) and the first non - detection ( @xmath47  mjd 53301.99 ) .",
    "similarly , for the nominal switch - on epoch ( @xmath48 ) , we adopt the midpoint between the last non - detection ( @xmath49  mjd 56110.85 ) and the first re - detection of the third on - phase ( @xmath50  mjd 56128.78 ) . using tempo2",

    "these results imply that the ratio of on / off spindown rates @xmath57 is therefore @xmath58 , i.e.  slightly higher than psr  b1931 + 24 but below psr  j1841@xmath00500 .      to estimate the implied current flow in the pulsar magnetosphere for both the on and off - states , we follow kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and consider the simplest possible emission model .",
    "we assume that , in the off - state , the pulsar spins down by a mechanism that does not involve a substantial particle ejection ( e.g. , it would be magnetic dipole radiation if the pulsar were in vacuum ) , while the rate in the on - state is enhanced by a torque from the current of an additional plasma outflow . assuming that the spindown energy loss rate in the on - state , @xmath59 , may be written as the sum of the energy loss rate in the off - state , @xmath60 , and the energy loss due to the additional plasma , @xmath61 , the corresponding charge density ( in cgs units ) in the plasma @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath64 is the polar cap radius , @xmath65 is the dipole surface magnetic field strength calculated from the spin frequency and spindown rate in the off - state , and @xmath66 is the speed of light .",

    ", it should also be noted that zhang , gil & dyks  ( 2007 ) proposed that intermittent pulsars are old isolated neutron stars which have entered the so - called `` death valley '' in the @xmath80 diagram ( chen & ruderman 1993 ) where the voltage across the neutron star polar cap is no longer sufficient for pair production in the neutron star magnetosphere , and the radio emission becomes sporadic .",
    "zhang et al",
    ".  suggest that non - dipolar magnetic field configurations , similar to the sunspot phenomenon , may be effective in such neutron stars and temporarily rejuvenate their radio emission .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the quasi - periodic nature seen in psr  b1931 + 24 can be explained quantitatively in this scenario , or indeed whether it applies to psr  j1832 + 0029  or psr  j1841@xmath00500 , since ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
