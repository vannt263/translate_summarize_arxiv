    "using the mit bag model , jaffe@xcite predicted a stable ( against strong decay ) six - quark flavor - singlet ( uuddss ) hadron ( referred to as @xmath3 ) with j=0 , i=0 , and s=@xmath6 .",
    "a plethora of mass calculations @xcite followed jaffe s work , and most of them predicted a weakly bound @xmath3 of mass just below the @xmath4 threshold ( 2231 mev ) . for 20 years experiments have searched for the @xmath3 , but no convincing evidence has been found for its existence @xcite .",
    "in fact , the candidate @xmath3s from different experiments have very different masses .",
    "one such experiment @xcite claims the observation of a very weakly bound @xmath4 hypernucleus which excludes at some level the existence of the @xmath3 .",
    "su(3 ) flavor - nonsinglet @xmath0 states are not usually discussed in the literature because of the expectation that they should be heavier than the @xmath3 .",
    "this expectation is due to the assumption that the effective magnetic one - gluon - exchange between the valence quarks is most attractive for the flavor - singlet channel , making the @xmath3 the lightest state .    in this work",
    "we consider the masses of two nonsinglet , doubly strange six - quark states which occur in the baryon - octet@xmath7baryon - octet direct product space @xcite .",
    "these include the j@xmath1 , i=0 @xmath0 from the j=1 @xmath8 octet , and the i=1 , i@xmath9=0 @xmath0 from the j@xmath2 27plet .",
    "based on model - independent assumptions , we show that it is likely that the @xmath3 is nearly degenerate with these states , and the @xmath3 mass is slightly _",
    "larger_. this contradiction with the mit bag model has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we study the mass ratios , rather than absolute masses , because the ratio carries smaller uncertainty and is more stable over a wide region of the parameter space .",
    "the qcd sum rule approach was used by ioffe@xcite to calculate the mass splitting in the baryonic decuplet .",
    "the situation for these @xmath0 states is analogous to the case of the @xmath10 ( i=0 , j=0 ) , @xmath11 ( j=1 , i=1 ) and @xmath12 ( j=1 , i=0 ) , in which the @xmath10 is the heaviest .",
    "the extra mass is attributed to the @xmath13 anomalous symmetry breaking of qcd , which is taken into account in model calculations using instantons .",
    "the method employed here does not need an instanton correction because as discussed in @xcite the instanton effects ( if any ) are effectively included in the quark condensates .",
    "if the singlet @xmath3 mass is greater than the @xmath4 mass , then it should not have been observed in previous @xmath0-search experiments @xcite . if the nonsinglet j=1 , i=0 ( octet ) @xmath0 mass is above the @xmath4 threshold ( 2231 mev ) , but below the @xmath5 threshold ( 2254 mev ) , then it can only decay weakly or electromagnetically because the strong decay to @xmath4 is not allowed .",
    "the situation is different for the j=0 , i=1 ( 27plet ) @xmath0 since it may isospin mix with the @xmath3 and the j=0 , i=0 ( 27plet ) @xmath0 to form physical states which strong decay to @xmath4 .",
    "however , for this case , if the mixing is small , experimental evidence for these @xmath0s may be a narrow peak in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "such an observation would not contradict the observed @xmath4 hypernucleus events @xcite .",

    "we expect the calculation to be reliable for a wide range of the borel mass m because the @xmath0 mass is determined by the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath52)@xcite which is much larger than the scale at which qcd vacuum fluctuations become large ( @xmath53  mev ) and where the borel smearing fails as it does for the case of the light pseudoscalar mesons .",

    "[ fig1]b shows the dependence of the mass ratios on the quark condensate .",
    "the curves have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b shows that large variation of the quark condensate , within a range consistent with that found in the literature , produces very little effect ( @xmath56 mev for the mass difference ) .",
    "[ fig1]c and fig .",
    "[ fig1]d show the mass ratio dependence on the continuum threshold @xmath46 and the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "again we see little sensitivity , about @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the mass ratio with respect to different borel masses for the @xmath3 and the j=0 , i=1 ( 27plet ) @xmath0 or the j=1 , i=0 ( octet ) @xmath0 was studied .",
    "the borel mass of the @xmath3 was fixed and the nonsinglet @xmath0 borel mass was varied .",
    "these mass ratios were essentially the same at each borel mass and they decreased linearly from 1.05 for a borel mass of 1.3 gev to 0.99 for a borel mass of 1.6 gev .",
    "other contributors to the theoretical uncertainty are the neglected terms in the ope ( which we expect to be small ) and the vacuum saturation assumption : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    our conclusion , based on the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that the mass ratio remains very close to unity in the parameter range where we believe the calculation to be reliable .",
    "both the j=1 , i=0 ( octet ) @xmath0 and the j=0 , i=1 ( 27plet ) @xmath0 are almost degenerate with the @xmath3 , and this degeneracy is not sensitive to the various qcd sum rule parameters .",
    "the mass difference is of the order of @xmath57 for both @xmath0 states , or about 2  mev for @xmath60=  2  gev .",
    "_ surprisingly _ , we find that the singlet @xmath3 is slightly heavier than both the j=0 , i=1 ( 27plet ) @xmath0 and the j=1 , i=0 ( octet ) @xmath0 .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider the consequences of these predictions for experiments designed to search for neutral , strange dibaryons .",
    "we note that the nonsinglet j@xmath1 , i=0 octet @xmath0 can not strong decay to @xmath4 ( due to angular momentum and parity conservation ) , and if its mass is lower than the @xmath61n threshold ( 2254  mev ) , then it may only decay electromagnetically ( via an m1 transition to the j@xmath2 , i=1 27plet @xmath0 and/or the singlet @xmath3 if these are lower in mass , or to the @xmath62 channel ) or weakly ( if its mass is below that of the other @xmath0s and the @xmath4 threshold ) .",
    "if the j@xmath2 , i=1 27plet @xmath0 has mass greater than 2231  mev it can not strong decay to @xmath4 due to isospin conservation",
    ". however , isospin mixing , due to electromagnetic interactions within the dibaryon , cause the physical j@xmath2 27plet @xmath0 to contain a small i=0 admixture , which allows strong decay to @xmath4 .",
    "if the admixture is small , then the state could have a narrow width of perhaps a few mev .",
    "the 27plet @xmath0 can not electromagnetically decay directly to the singlet @xmath3 ( except via two - photon decay ) , however an e1 transition to the @xmath62 is permitted .",
    "if the j=0 27plet @xmath0 is below the other @xmath0s and the @xmath4 threshold , then it may only decay by the weak interaction .",
    "if we assume the predicted mass ratios found here and that each mass is between the @xmath4 mass and the @xmath61n mass , then the strong and electromagnetic decay schemes for the three @xmath0s will be as shown in fig .",
    "if the decay of the j@xmath2 27plet @xmath0 is driven by the strong decay channel via the small isospin mixing i=0 component rather than by the electromagnetic decay to the @xmath62 channel , then a relatively narrow peak should appear in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum between 2231 and 2254  mev .",
    "the decay of the j@xmath1 , i=0 octet @xmath0 to the @xmath62 channel would result in a broad three - body phase space distribution for the @xmath4 mass spectrum if the photon is not observed .",
    "the electromagnetic decays are as follows : ( 1 ) j@xmath1 , i=0 octet @xmath0 to the j@xmath2 27plet @xmath0 is a @xmath63i=0 and 1 , m1 transition , ( 2 ) j@xmath1 , i=0 octet @xmath0 to @xmath62 occurs via e1 and m1 transitions ( all are @xmath63i=0 ) , and ( 3 ) j@xmath2 27plet @xmath0 to @xmath62 occurs via an e1 transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the strong decay of the @xmath3 is indicated by the thick , solid arrow , the strong decay via the small isospin mixing component is shown by the thick , dashed arrow , and the electromagnetic decays by the thin , solid arrows .",
    "observation of these nonsinglet @xmath0s would not contradict the @xmath4 hypernucleus events already observed @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the candidate nonsinglet @xmath0 ( j=0 , i=1 ) observed by shabazian _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can be explained by these results since we predict the j@xmath2 27plet @xmath0 to be approximately degenerate with @xmath3 .",
    "however , the mass must be less than that reported in @xcite in order to be below the @xmath61n breakup threshold .",
    "clearly the discovery of flavor - nonsinglet @xmath0 dibaryons would require us to revisit traditional hadronic structure models and require a better understanding of quark - quark effective interactions .",
