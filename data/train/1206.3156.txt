    "thus , effectively the mass ` average ' of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 baryon , and the @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 baryons were considered .",
    "however , as the coefficients of the quark mass flavour symmetry are just functions of the average quark mass , the expansion coefficients do not change from using non - degenerate to @xmath35 or @xmath36 mass degenerate quarks provided that the average quark mass is kept constant @xcite .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to investigate isospin splittings , i.e.  when the @xmath3 quark mass is different to the @xmath4 quark mass , using only results from @xmath34 or @xmath36 flavour simulations .    as the baryon mass differences ( e.g.  @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 ) depend on the @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath4 mass difference and are thus small , we find that it is sufficient to consider the @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion in the quark mass including both linear terms ( leading order , lo ) and quadratic terms ( next to leading order , nlo ) .",

    "we saw little curvature in hadron masses in the quark mass range considered in @xcite ( see also section  [ comparison_fan ] ) , namely , from the three degenerate flavour pion mass at @xmath37 to the physical pion mass @xmath38 , so we conclude that a much larger quark mass range is needed to reliably determine curvature .",
    "we achieve this larger range by extending the numerical results to ` _ partially quenched _ ' or pq quark masses ( where the valence quark masses do not have to be the same as the sea or dynamical quark masses ) with a spread of quark masses from about one third of the strange quark mass up to the charmed quark mass .",
    "we also consider part of the next to next to leading order ( nnlo ) ( cubic terms ) in the @xmath0 flavour symmetry expansion .",
    "( the nnlo terms were also indicated in @xcite ; we have now completed this computation , @xcite . )",

    "we are following an older strand , going back to gell - mann and okubo @xcite of looking at the breaking of the non - chiral @xmath0 symmetry , by quark mass differences .",
    "in chiral perturbation theory the expansion is about the point where all three quarks are massless ; here we expand about a point where the three quarks have equal ( non - zero ) masses each about a third of the physical strange quark mass .    as well as the baryon @xmath0 octet flavour expansion",
    ", we will also need the values of the quark mass corresponding to the physical point .",
    "we can achieve this by considering the equivalent @xmath0 flavour expansion , but now for the pseudoscalar meson octet .",
    "the same procedure as for the baryon octet is required : first the @xmath0 flavour expansion coefficients must be determined and then the experimental values of the masses of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons can be used to determine the required physical quark mass point .",
    "these can then be used , together with the @xmath0 baryon octet flavour expansion , to determine the mass splittings for the baryon octet .",
    "we shall find that the lo term is dominant ( both for the baryon and pseudoscalar octets ) and so the nlo ( and nnlo corrections ) may be taken as an indication that our @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion appears to be a highly convergent series .",

    "before discussing partial quenching , we first consider the case where the valence quark masses are the same as the sea quark masses , the so - called ` _ unitary line _ ' .",
    "the @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion , @xcite , for all of the outer ring octet baryons consisting of a pair of identical flavour quarks and a third , different quark can be compactly written up to nlo as @xmath42 with quarks @xmath43 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 from @xmath44 , where @xmath45 we shall consider the @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion of @xmath46 @xcite , rather than @xmath47 .",

    "a linear function is sufficient ; for the large quark mass range considered in section  [ n_num_res ] a better fit to the numerical data was found using @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 all depend on the average quark mass @xmath54 , which will be held constant in the following simulations .",
    "keeping @xmath54 constant reduces the number of coefficients that must be determined ( and indeed makes the computation tractable ) .    from fig .",

    "<S> using an @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion in the quark mass , we determine the qcd component of the nucleon , sigma and xi mass splittings of the baryon octet due to up - down ( and strange ) quark mass differences in terms of the kaon mass splitting . provided the average quark mass is kept constant , the expansion coefficients in our procedure can be determined from computationally cheaper simulations with mass degenerate sea quarks and partially quenched valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> both the linear and quadratic terms in the @xmath0 flavour symmetry breaking expansion are considered ; it is found that the quadratic terms only change the result by a few percent , indicating that the expansion is highly convergent . </S>"
