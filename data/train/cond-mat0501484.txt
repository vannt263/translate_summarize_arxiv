    "during the last ten - fifteen years overwhelming experimental evidences for a @xmath4wave pairing symmetry in high-@xmath5 superconducting cuprates have been collected @xcite .",
    "such an unconventional symmetry plays a crucial role in determining the physics of the superconducting phase .",
    "in particular the presence of four nodes in the @xmath4wave superconducting gap @xmath6 and , consequently , the existence of gapless quasiparticles ( qp ) excitations down to zero energy strongly affects the low temperature transport of these systems .",
    "the energy spectrum of the qp in the proximity of the @xmath4wave gap four nodes has a dirac cone shape    e_= where @xmath7 is the energy dispersion of the non interacting electrons , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent respectively the fermi velocity and the slope of the superconducting gap @xmath10 at the nodes .",
    "a weak amount of disorder originates@xcite a finite quasiparticle elastic lifetime @xmath11 and a finite density of states at the fermi level @xmath12 , @xmath13 being a cutoff of order @xmath14 . in the low temperature and frequency regime the conductivities of the system ( both the electrical @xmath2 and the thermal @xmath15 )",
    "do not depend on the amount of disorder but only on the bare qp spectrum parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to the so - called _ universality _ of the low energy values of the conductivities in @xmath4wave superconductors . indeed , by allowing the impurity - scattering between all the four nodes of the @xmath4wave spectrum and neglecting the vertex corrections ,",
    "the following `` universal '' expressions are found@xcite    _  , t 0 (  , t ) = , _  , t 0 = .",
    "[ equniv ] the inclusion of vertex corrections modifies @xmath2 by a factor depending on disorder and fermi - liquid parameters , while it leaves @xmath15 totally unchanged@xcite .",
    "however , in cuprate superconductors this generic result could be strongly affected by localization corrections because these materials are quasi - bidimensional and quantum interference effects are usually relevant in low - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view the evaluation of the localization corrections to the conductivities in a @xmath4wave superconductor is a really complex topic .",
    "indeed , when considering a @xmath4wave bcs hamiltonian in the presence of disorder and neglecting interactions among quasiparticles , the theory for the quantum interference predicts a multitude of different regimes and crossovers depending on the specific symmetries of the underlying fermi surface and of the disorder@xcite .",
    "anyway , in the generic case of non - magnetic disorder connecting all nodal points the theoretical calculations indicate the occurrence of an anderson localization of the @xmath4wave qp excitations@xcite .",
    "the theory also predicts precursor effects , the so - called weak localization corrections , which are logarithmic in temperature .",
    "the analysis of experimental findings for the thermal transport in the cuprates does not appear to fit the above theoretical scenario .",
    "indeed when comparing these predictions with the experimental measurements a convincing agreement is found neither with the `` universal behavior '' nor with the complete localization .",
    "it is worth stressing that thermal conductivity is conveniently used in order to test the theoretical results , because , differently from charge conductivity , it is not affected by the vertex corrections allowing for a direct comparison between the expression of @xmath16 in eq . and the experimental data .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements have been performed on various cuprates , down to temperatures of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "in particular the residual thermal electronic conductivity @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , extrapolated from measurements carried out on optimally doped @xmath20 ( @xmath21)@xcite and @xmath22 ( @xmath23)@xcite seems to be in agreement with the universal result ( eq . with @xmath24 and @xmath25 extracted from arpes measurements @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for @xmath23 , leaving no room for sizeable weak localization corrections .",
    "the situation is partially different for @xmath21 , where the inclusion of sizeable weak localization corrections would provide not unplausible larger ratios @xmath26 than the estimate of ref . .",
    "however ( or moreover ) thermal magnetoconductance measurements@xcite do not give any indications of the presence of detectable weak localization corrections which should appear as a positive @xmath27 crossing to a @xmath28 contribution at very small fields .",
    "this result is quite generic for all materials at different dopings .",
    "on the other hand , measurements performed on @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) underdoped and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) optimally doped provide a residual conductivity @xmath18 much smaller than the universal value .",
    "such a result , compatible with @xmath33 could be ascribed to the localization of the quasi - particles responsible of the low temperature energy transport .",
    "recently measurements of @xmath18 at various doping became available in @xmath34 ( lsco , ref . ) and in @xmath21 @xcite and made the theoretical scenario even more involved .",
    "in particular a significant doping dependence of @xmath18 has been observed in these cuprates .",
    "such a dependence is hardly compatible with the universal behavior , particularly in the lsco compounds , since it would imply a strong variation on doping of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in partial contrast with arpes measurements@xcite and the temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "moreover @xmath18 turns out to be finite and no localization is found for all dopings in the superconducting phase .    concerning the absence of weak localization contributions",
    "a main issue is the estimate of the temperature below which quantum interference effects start to be visible before localization occurs . in the metallic phase",
    "this issue involves the determination of the dephasing time @xmath35 , i.e. the time scale above which coherence is destroyed by inelastic processes .",
    "the energy scale @xmath0 represents a cutoff for quantum interference and plays a crucial role in determining quantitatively the magnitude of the localization effects at low temperature@xcite .    in principle",
    ", the situation becomes more involved when considering a @xmath4wave superconductor .",
    "due to the extra symmetry of the cooper pairing , quantum interference determines a relevant correction to the density of states which is logarithmic in energy since it derive from integration on diffusive modes with energy as a cutoff@xcite .",
    "this fact reflects in the conductivity with the onset of an other source of logarithmic corrections coming from the thermal average of the density of states contribution .",
    "these corrections no longer depend logarithmically on the dephasing time ( @xmath36 ) , but directly on t similarly to the interaction contributions@xcite ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "as a consequence one can naturally individuate two contributions to the conductivity corrections , coming out respectively from the modes damped by @xmath38 ( as in the normal metal ) and from those damped by the energy @xmath39 that can be viewed , roughly speaking , as the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient and of the density of states ( @xmath40 ) . indeed half of the contribution to the renormalization group ( rg ) equation@xcite for @xmath41 comes from the first term and half from the second term .",
    "however it can be easily shown that in the range of temperature from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , to which we are interested in , the second kind of corrections can be neglected@xcite , because of the rather small value of @xmath44 which is usually much less than @xmath45 .",
    "we can therefore estimate the localization correction to the spin conductivity @xmath41 of a @xmath4wave superconductor , ( and consequently to the thermal conductivity which is related to @xmath41 by a generalized wiedmann - franz law@xcite ) , considering only the expression for @xmath46 given by ( ) _ ^-1 = = - [ eqn : correction ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that the right term of the eq .",
    "[ eqn : correction ] differs for a factor @xmath49 from the analogous rg expression@xcite since , according to the above discussion , only in half of rg contribution the relevant time region for the interference ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath50 , while in the other half it ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath51 .    in normal metals the most effective mechanism of dephasing",
    "is provided by the interactions among electrons @xcite .",
    "indeed interactions in presence of disorder have a twofold effect : on one side they generate corrections which can compete with those due to pure quantum interference , on the other they provide an intrinsic dephasing time @xmath52 which limits the quantum interference processes for @xmath53 .",
    "a systematic evaluation of interaction corrections to the conductivities in the d - wave superconducting phase was carried out in refs .",
    "( see also ) .",
    "since these corrections are proportional to the disorder induced density of states @xmath54 , they should be negligible for clean enough systems and for temperatures of the order of @xmath55 mk , at which the thermal transport measurements are presently available@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the analysis of ref . and",
    "to derive an explicit expression for the dephasing time @xmath35 induced in the superconducting phase by the interactions among the @xmath4wave quasiparticles .",
    "in particular we will determine @xmath0 as the mass of the diffuson and the cooperon ( i.e. , the two particle propagators in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels ) in analogy with refs . where @xmath0 was evaluated in the metallic phase . here",
    "we will perform a one - loop analysis of the interaction terms , within the non - linear @xmath56-model which is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we find that the most relevant contribution to @xmath0 comes from the triplet channel . indeed",
    "the singlet channel contribution is ruled out by the lack of particle conservation in the superconducting state@xcite . on the other hand the residual interaction in the cooper channel , which would lead to a @xmath57 instability when it is attractive , provides a subleading contribution to @xmath0 when it is repulsive , as we shall assume here . as a final outcome",
    "the following estimate for ratio @xmath45 , entering in eq .",
    "[ eqn : correction ] will be derived ( _ 0 ) .",
    "[ tftzero ] where @xmath58 is the fermi energy and the proportionality factor is of order one . in agreement with the results for the metallic phase @xmath35 is proportional to the inverse of temperature @xmath59 .",
    "moreover the linear dependence of the ratio @xmath45 on the elastic scattering time suggests that quantum interference corrections at finite temperature would be larger in cleaner systems , differently from what one could expect intuitively@xcite .    by inserting in eq .",
    "the experimental determinations of @xmath8 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we will estimate the value @xmath35 for different cuprates , in order to predict from eq . the temperature below which localization corrections should become relevant .",
    "in particular in @xmath21 and @xmath23 , optimally doped , we will find that the corrections to the universal results should become relevant , of order of @xmath63 per cent , for temperatures of the order of @xmath64 k , in disagreement with the experimental results .",
    "actually , it is not clear why localization of the quasiparticles does not occur in @xmath21 , while an explanation can be found for the bismuth cuprate @xmath23 , as we will explicitely point out in sec .",
    "iv . indeed",
    "a rough estimate of the transport times , from electrical conductivity at higher temperature , suggests the existence in this last compound of other mechanisms for decoherence and dephasing , more efficient than the mechanism of interaction in a disordered environment we have considered here .    finally , in sec .",
    "v we will present the concluding remarks on the problems posed by our findings .",
    "in this section we summarize the field theory approach and introduce the non - linear @xmath2-model ( nl@xmath56 m ) , that will be used in the following to evaluate the dephasing time @xmath0 in the @xmath4wave superconducting phase .",
    "it is worth noting that in the superconducting phase the evaluation of the dephasing time using the nl@xmath56 m is simpler and more direct than using the standard perturbation theory , because of the presence of both the normal and the anomalous green functions with specific @xmath65 dependences .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we start discussing in this section the nl@xmath56 m in the absence of quasiparticle interactions , which will be included in a second step . in order to describe the properties of the disordered system within a path integral formulation , we introduce the spinorial representation @xcite    ( r)= ( |c(r ) + i_yc(r ) ) , |(r)=[c]^t .",

    "the average over disorder distribution is performed by using the replica trick method .",

    "this leads to @xmath184 ( ybco(123 ) ) and @xmath185 ( bscco)@xcite .    from these values",
    "we obtain the following estimates for the dephasing time in optimally doped ybco(123 ) and bscco & 410 ^ 7 + & 10 ^ 6 [ bscco ]    we can turn now to estimate the localization corrections to the transport coefficients according to eq . :",
    "= -    as stated before , the log factor contains the elastic scattering time . as a consequence ,",
    "the localization corrections tend -rather surprisingly- to increase with decreasing disorder .",
    "the outcome of our calculation is that for both materials we would predict that localization effects should be visible in the temperature range we are interested in , i.e. , hundreds of mk .",
    "in particular for a temperature of @xmath186 k we get for @xmath187 the values @xmath188 and @xmath189 in the case of ybco(123 ) and bscco . at @xmath55",
    "mk we get @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively .",
    "more than these specific values we want to stress that our calculation ( which possibly underestimates the effect ) gives a relative variation of @xmath192 and @xmath193 of about ( or even more than ) @xmath194 per cent for temperatures lower than @xmath186k .",
    "the point is that the @xmath195 is small ( but not dramatically small ) while @xmath45 is large enough to provide a sizeable correction . for ybco(124 ) we expect similar values than ybco(123 ) or even larger since these compounds are usually quite clean .",
    "these results are quite puzzling because , as we mentioned in the introduction , no relevant localization effects are found in this temperature regime but for the case of ybco(124 ) and pcco .",
    "the simplest possible explanation of such a discrepancy could be related to the existence in the real materials of other possible sources of inelastic scattering , beyond the diffusion enhanced electron - electron interaction ( in particular scattering with some kind of quantum critical fluctuations@xcite ) , and in principle this would be responsible of a further contribution to the dephasing effects .    we can try to get the effective dephasing time from the temperature dependence of @xmath196 obtained in ref . and , as we did for @xmath11 . by assuming that the temperature dependence comes from inelastic processes and writing @xmath197 , we take as a rough estimate for the dephasing time @xmath198 , even though the two times are conceptually different .",
    "this procedure gives    ( ) _ exp & 210 ^ 6 ( ) ^4.2 + ( ) _ exp & 10 [ experbscco ]    the comparison of eqs . and does not reveal any inconsistency in taking the diffusion enhanced electron - electron interaction as the predominant source of dephasing at low temperature in ybco(123 ) .",
    "in particular in the temperature range around @xmath199 our previous estimate of @xmath35 and the value of @xmath200 are of the same order of magnitude but display a different temperature dependence with the `` experimental '' estimate growing as @xmath201 in the low temperature regime . as a consequence the scattering due to the diffusion enhanced el - el interaction is dominant below @xmath202 k and our previous theoretical estimate of eq . has not to be corrected . on the contrary , in bscco",
    "the `` experimental '' @xmath35 displays the same @xmath59 behavior of the theoretical prediction , but with a much smaller coefficient , suggesting the presence of some other mechanism of inelastic scattering more effective than the diffusion enhanced electron - electron interaction . in this case",
    "it becomes more appropriate to use the `` experimental '' estimation of @xmath35 to evaluate the value of @xmath203 , the result being @xmath204 -0.03 ( at 1k ) and -0.05 ( at 100mk ) .",
    "these values can be taken as an indication of negligible weak localization corrections in bscco because of strong decoherence effects .    according to the above discussion and contrary to the experimental finding",
    ", significative localization effects would be expected in ybco(123 ) as well as in ybco(124 ) , while the presence of a different source of strong inelastic scattering in bscco would explain the irrelevance of the localization corrections even at the lowest temperatures experimentally accessed .",
    "in this paper we have dealt with the problem of the localization in high-@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "their quasi 2-dimensional lattice structure would suggest that localization effects should become relevant at least in the low - temperature regime .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , the low - temperature transport measurements in the cuprates depend strongly on the different materials and point out to the inadequacy of the prediction of a complete localization with sizeable weak localization precursor effects .",
    "of course the electronic interactions could play in principle a relevant role in the explanation of the real material properties .",
    "a main effect of the interactions , which are a source of inelastic scattering , is to introduce a low - energy scale , the inverse of the dephasing time , which limits the quantum interference processes .",
    "interactions also generate completely new corrections to transport , which could in principle compete with the localization effects .",
    "however they are expected to be negligible in the temperature - range of interest if disorder is weak @xcite .",
    "we have derived the expression for the dephasing time @xmath35 in @xmath1-wave superconductors within a non - linear @xmath2-model formulation of the disorder problem in the presence of interactions .",
    "our result differs from the result for the metallic phase because of the vanishing of the singlet contribution , due to the symmetries of the superconducting phase .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath0 comes from the interaction in the triplet channel , while a repulsive residual interaction in the cooper channel only produces a subleading term .",
    "the scale @xmath0 allows to estimate the size of the localization corrections to the heat ( and spin ) transport .",
    "indeed we have estimated the localization corrections that are theoretically expected in the various materials .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that other sources of inelastic scattering could provide smaller dephasing times in real materials , and attempted to provide rough experimental estimates of @xmath0 to make a direct comparison with the data for thermal transport .",
    "the outcome of this comparison is that the estimated dephasing time is not small enough to reconcile the theoretical and the experimental findings in the cuprates .",
    "this is particularly evident from the failure of the theoretical predictions for the localization corrections in the case of ybco(123 ) .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in the introduction , the scenario of the low - temperature transport in cuprates was made even more involved by very recent experiments in lsco @xcite and in ybco(123)@xcite , which claim for a strong doping - dependence of the thermal conductivity .",
    "the permanence of inconsistencies with the prediction of the localization theory , even when the electron - electron interactions and dephasing are taken into account , provides a clue of the relevance of some other effects which have been neglected in our analysis .",
    "for instance our theoretical predictions could be changed substantially by the proximity to a @xmath57 instability or to a quantum critical point ( which would enhance considerably the estimate of the energy scale @xmath0 ) , by proximity to a nesting condition , by small @xmath205 scattering and domain wall scattering , by the removal of the hypothesis of weak - coupling interactions , which could become questionable especially for the underdoped cuprates and large disorder .",
    "all the above effects will lower the temperature scale below which localization become sizeable .",
    "finally we would like briefly to mention the relevant problem of magnetic impurities in the localization process . since the scattering with magnetic impurities determines@xcite a vanishing of the localization corrections , a measurement of the low temperature transport coefficients in presence of magnetic impurities would be of a great relevance for understanding the role of the anderson localization in the low - temperature transport of the cuprates , especially in the case of ybco(124 ) , where localization could be at work in providing a vanishing thermal transport . in ybco(124 )",
    "it would be also useful a systematic and careful analysis of magnetoconductance and thermal transport at small fields to compare with the findings in the cuprates which do not show localization . for these latter systems it would instead be important to assess the absence of magnetic impurities and local moments by magnetic measurements .          where @xmath207 and @xmath76 are odd integers which label the matsubara frequencies @xmath208 and @xmath209 , which have opposite sign ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "notice that because of eq . in the superconducting phase @xmath211 and @xmath212",
    "are not independent .",
