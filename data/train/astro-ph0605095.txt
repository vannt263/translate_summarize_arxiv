    "they are important objects to study because of the insights they provide on : the formation and destruction of globular clusters ; star formation processes in extreme environments ; and the triggering and feeding of supergalactic winds .",
    "the properties of young massive star clusters are extensively reviewed in a recent proceedings ( lamers , smith & nota 2004 ) .",

    "they find that the optically - bright structures containing the clusters correspond to known sources at x - ray , infra - red ( ir ) and radio wavelengths .",
    "they argue that this can not be accidental and suggest that regions a , c and e represent the parts of the starburst core which are the least obscured along the line of sight .",
    "region a is of special interest .",
    "it contains a remarkable complex of sscs with very high continuum and emission line surface brightnesses ( oconnell & mangano 1978 ; oconnell et al .",
    "the well - known large - scale bipolar outflow or ` superwind ' appears to be centred on regions a and c ( shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ; gallagher et al .",

    "( 2005 ) have catalogued the young stellar clusters in the starburst core of m82 using hst archive data .",
    "they find a total of 197 optically visible clusters with 86 of these residing in region a.    the age and evolution of the starburst in m82 have been the subject of numerous studies .",
    "the starburst region appears to be composed of two spatially separate stellar populations .",
    "the presence of a strong ir continuum and large co absorption index indicates a population of red supergiants in the core ( rieke et al .",
    "1993 ; satyapal et al . 1997 ; frster schreiber et al .",

    "( 2003 ) find that two bursts are needed to reproduce the observational properties .",
    "the latter authors find the bursts occurred @xmath14 10 and 5  myr ago with a duration of a few million years .",
    "the first burst was particularly intense in the core and the second occurred mainly in the circumnuclear regions .",
    "while models of the active starburst region suggest star formation is propagating outwards , studies of star clusters outside the central regions reveal considerably older star formation episodes .",

    "one long outstanding question concerning starburst environments is whether the initial mass function is abnormal in the sense that less low mass stars are produced in an intense star - forming episode .",
    "m82 has been the focus of many studies aimed at settling this question .",
    "the mass function of the central starburst region of m82 has been estimated based on the light - to - mass ratio , but this is controversial mainly owing to the difficulty of determining extinction corrections in such a complex system . some studies ( e.g. oconnell & mangano 1978 ; telesco et al .",
    "1991 ; satyapal et al .",
    "1997 ) find a normal mass function , while others ( e.g. rieke et al . 1993",
    "; forster - schreiber et al . 2003 ) find a deficiency of low mass stars .",
    "light - to - mass ratios determined for individual sscs are more robust .",
    "smith & gallagher ( 2001 ) measured the dynamical mass of m82-f and showed that its visual mass - to - light ratio required a mass function deficient in low mass stars , and thus it is unlikely to become an old globular cluster .",
    "mccrady , gilbert & graham ( 2003 ) determined dynamical masses for two sscs on the western edge of the active starburst region in m82 , and found that one object appeared to be deficient in low mass stars .",
    "a re - analysis of m82-f by mccrady , graham & vacca ( 2005 ) based on hst images obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and keck / nirspec spectra confirm that it has an abnormal mass function , and thus possibly a peculiar stellar mass function .",
    "in contrast , analyses of nebular line diagnostic ratios indicate a lack of hard - uv photons in some starburst regions , implying a deficit of high mass stars ( e.g. puxley et al .",
    "1989 ; achtermann & lacy 1995 ) . in a recent study ,",
    "rigby & rieke ( 2004 ) suggest an alternative explanation for the low [ ne ] /[ne ] ratios observed in solar metallicity - type starbursts .",
    "they propose that the hard ionizing photons from massive stars are absorbed in long - lived ultracompact h  regions which are a consequence of the high interstellar densities encountered in a starburst .",
    "the proximity of m82 ( @xmath17  pc ) means that individual clusters are easily resolved by _ hst _ and are bright enough to obtain spectroscopy . in this paper , we present spectroscopy obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) onboard _ hst _ for five massive clusters of varying ages .",
    "the first object , which we designate as m82-a1 , is a bright isolated cluster in region a. we will focus on the analysis and interpretation of this stis dataset because it represents the first optical spectroscopy of an individual cluster and its immediate environment in the starburst core .",
    "we also present stis spectroscopy for one slit position crossing both clusters f and l , and slits covering the two brightest clusters in the fossil region b. these spectra are of lower quality than those of m82-a1 but we are able to derive spectroscopic ages .",
    "the stis slit position for cluster m82-a1 extends across regions a and c , close to the nucleus and the base of the superwind , sampling the ionized gas in the starburst core on spatial scales of a few parsecs . in a separate paper ( smith et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , we will discuss the nature of the ionized component in the m82 starburst , as revealed by these optical emission line data .",
    "we obtained long - slit hst / stis spectra at four positions in the centre of m82 ( go 9117 ; p.i .",

    "after basic reduction and cosmic ray rejection , normalized fringe flats were prepared for each exposure , following the procedure outlined in stis / isr98 - 29 .",
    "these fringe flats were then applied to correct the fringing in the spectra .",

    "it is unlikely that contamination from nebular emission lines in the broad - band filters is causing the radius variations because the emission lines are weak ( see figs .  [ fig - sp - blue ] and  [ fig - sp - red ] ) and the f814w filter does not contain any significant nebular emission .",
    "the presence of dust in the h  region may , however , produce a decrease in radius towards bluer wavelengths . a diffuse foreground screen of dust will change the brightness but , since it will dim the cluster uniformly , it will not affect the radius or shape as a function of wavelength . however , if dust is concentrated in the h  region , then the cluster would maintain a roughly constant shape ( as measured ) , yet be dimmer and smaller with decreasing wavelength because of the greater obscuration at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we therefore conclude that the most probable explanation for the decrease in radius with decreasing wavelength is the effect of dust in the surrounding compact h  region .",

    "gallagher & smith ( 1999 ) derived the age of cluster m82-f by comparing the observed spectrum in the region of the balmer jump with theoretical model cluster spectra . here , we use recent high - resolution population synthesis models to fit the combined spectrum of m82-a1 .    first , we binned the g750 m stis spectrum to match the g430l spectrum and merged the two spectra .",

    "the quality of the fit of the model spectrum to the observed de - reddened spectrum below the balmer jump then determines the age .    using this approach , we find that the stis spectra of m82-a1 can only be matched by the sb99 synthetic spectra for a relatively narrow age range of 57 myr and @xmath1011.2 mag .",
    "we checked the sb99 results with a comparable grid taken from the independent synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; bc03 ) , which incorporate a lower resolution ( 3  ) but more realistic empirical spectral library .",

    "the overall fit to the continuum is good , and it can be seen that the upper members of the balmer series are also fairly well - fitted ( e.g. h8 which has minimal nebular line emission ) .",
    "this model , which has the largest balmer jump in either model grid , slightly overestimates the observed flux in the balmer continuum below 3600  .",
    "the discrepancy could be caused by internal extinction within m82-a1 or perhaps a small error in the stis calibration here .",

    "we can now employ two independent indicators for reddening and age to determine if they are consistent with those found from the spectral analysis .",

    "1977 ; chevalier & clegg 1985 ) . for a star cluster , the source of energy is first stellar winds and then supernovae . for m82-a1 , we estimate that its cluster wind has a mechanical luminosity @xmath196 ergs@xmath22 from the starburst99 models for a kroupa imf and the derived mass of m82-a1",
    ". we can estimate the radius of the shell formed by the cluster wind using the standard equation for pressure - driven superbubbles from weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) : @xmath197 where @xmath188 is the shell radius , @xmath198 is the ambient mass density , and @xmath199 is the age . using the value of @xmath200 given above , an ambient number density of 1000  3 ( sect .",
    "[ para - hii ] ) , and an age of 6.4  myr , the predicted radius is 150 or 100 pc , if we assume a thermalisation efficiency of 100% or 10% respectively .",
    "these values are obviously far in excess of the measured radius of 4.5  pc , and suggest that the h  region has not developed according to the standard model .    oey & garca - segura ( 2004 ) and dopita et al .",
    "( 2005 ) consider the effect of the ambient interstellar pressure on the dynamical evolution of pressure - driven superbubbles",
    ". a high ambient pressure will inhibit the growth of the h  region and it will stall when the internal pressure of the superbubble equals the ambient pressure .",
    "the internal pressure @xmath201 is given by weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) as : @xmath202 this leads to an internal pressure @xmath203 of @xmath204 or @xmath205  3k , assuming thermal efficiencies of 100 and 10% respectively .",
    "the latter value is reasonably close to our estimate of the total ( thermal and turbulent ) ambient interstellar pressure of @xmath206  3k . while this is a rough estimate , and",
    "does not take into account the fact that the bubble will not abruptly stop expanding when it stalls , it illustrates that the high ambient pressure is probably sufficient to modify the evolution of the h  region surrounding the cluster m82-a1 .    using eqn .",
    "( 3 ) , dopita et al . (",
    "2005 ) show that all stalled h  regions will have a common ratio of @xmath207 , and since @xmath200 scales roughly with the flux of ionizing photons @xmath127 , then all stalled h  regions should have the same ionization parameter as given by eqn .",
    "this relationship may help to explain the uniformity of the ionization parameter on many scales in the starburst regions of m82 discussed above and by frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "another important possibility to consider is whether the cluster wind from m82-a1 has developed according to the standard adiabatically expanding wind model .",
    "canto , raga & rodrguez ( 2000 ) present an analytic mass - loaded cluster wind model for a dense cluster of massive stars .",
    "they find that there are two solutions depending on the properties of the surrounding ism ; the standard supersonic solution or a subsonic solution if the environment is at high pressure .",
    "the latter solution may apply to m82-a1 .",
    "the supersonic wind solution can also be inhibited if the cluster wind is sufficiently dense to promote radiative cooling ( silich , tenorio - tagle & mu~ non - tun 2003 ) .",
    "this occurs if the cluster is massive but compact and a supernebula can then be formed ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "2005 ) . from their figures , we find that the cluster m82-a1 is not in the regime where catastrophic cooling will occur .    ultimately , it is hard to understand how the observed m82 galactic superwind is generated if the environment stifles its development because of the high ambient pressure .",
    "chevalier & fransson ( 2001 ) consider this problem in relation to their prediction that the compact radio supernovae in m82 are radiative and thus are unable to provide sufficient energy to drive a galactic wind .",
    "they hypothesise that galactic winds are driven only by supernovae occurring in a low density , hot medium .",
    "another way around this problem is to conjecture that there is a pressure gradient in the central region of m82 such that the outer clusters are in a lower pressure region .",
    "the winds from these clusters will then be able to develop and may produce highly - collimated outflows , as envisaged in the interacting wind model of tenorio - tagle , silich & mu~ non - tun ( 2003 ) .",
    "whatever the precise reason for the compact nature of the h  region surrounding m82-a1 , it is clear that the unusually high ambient pressure in the m82 starburst environment must play an important role .",
    "we have presented optical hst / stis spectroscopy of five massive clusters in m82 .",
    "our best data are for cluster m82-a1 and its environment in region a of the starburst core .",
    "this region contains a large complex of young clusters which appear to be responsible for a major component of the superwind .",
    "we have sought to derive the properties of m82-a1 , and thereby clarify the age of the recent starburst , and to investigate the nature of its ionized environment .    the stis g430l spectrum of m82-a1 is dominated by balmer absorption lines and a weak balmer jump suggesting a young age .",
    "we measure a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath184 kms@xmath22 .",
    "this value and its position 130 pc north - east of the 2@xmath171 m nucleus suggests that m82-a1 is spatially and kinematically associated with the starburst core .    using the evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) which includes a high resolution spectral library to derive both the age and reddening of m82-a1 , we find that we can only match the spectral energy distribution and depth of the balmer jump for a narrow age range of 57 myr and a reddening of @xmath1011.2 mag .",
    "the independent bc03 models give similar results .",
    "the stis g750 m spectrum shows that m82-a1 is surrounded by a compact h  region .",
    "we have recovered the intrinsic nebular spectrum by subtracting the best - fitting synthetic spectrum and find that the nebular reddening of @xmath104 mag agrees well with the value determined from the cluster sed .",
    "we adopt a mean of the two methods to give @xmath108 mag .",
    "the observed equivalent width of the h@xmath8 emission line provides an upper limit to the age of 6.7 myr , in agreement with the depth of the balmer jump .",
    "we adopt an age of @xmath2 myr for m82-a1 .",
    "comparison with the models of frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that the formation of m82-a1 is associated with the most recent burst of star formation which took place @xmath1446 myr ago .",
    "the overall morphology of region a and the fact that a major component of the superwind is centred on this region suggests that the clusters are coeval .",
    "if this is the case , then region a must correspond to a particularly intense episode of star formation .    we have used archive hst images to derive the radius and mass of m82-a1 via photometry . we find that the cluster is elliptical with a mean effective radius of @xmath0 pc and a minor / major axis ratio of @xmath60 .",
    "the cluster effective radius appears to decrease towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as being due to dust in the surrounding h  region rather than mass segregation because it seems difficult to produce a radial colour gradient in a young cluster .",
    "we derive a mass of 0.71.3@xmath208 m@xmath5 for m82-a1 depending on whether we adopt a kroupa or salpeter imf .",
    "we have sought to understand the nature of the h  region surrounding m82-a1 . from hst",
    "/ pc images , we have derived an effective radius of only @xmath63 pc and find that it is highly elliptical with a minor / major axis ratio of 0.57 .",
    "it is also of high density ; the [ s ] doublet in the stis g750 m spectrum gives an electron density of @xmath209 @xmath210 or a thermal pressure of @xmath6@xmath211  3k , for = @xmath2121@xmath213 .",
    "the diffuse ionized gas along the stis slit has a slightly lower density which , together with a measured high turbulent velocity dispersion of 45 kms@xmath22 , suggests that m82-a1 is immersed in an unusually high pressure environment .",
    "we also find that the oxygen abundance of the h  region is close to , or slightly higher than , solar .",
    "we find that the ionization parameter @xmath135 of the h  region is @xmath214 in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath186 derived by frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for scales of a few tens to 500 pc .",
    "our measurement thus extends the uniformity of the m82 starburst down to the scale of individual cluster h  regions , and suggests that the entire starburst is self - adjusting with a constant number of ionizing photons per atom .",
    "we have sought to understand the compactness of the hregion around m82-a1 , given that it is much smaller than the size predicted for its age according to the standard model for a pressure - driven superbubble .",
    "we find that the high pressure of the environment may have caused the bubble to stall or follow a different wind solution to the standard supersonic adiabatic one .",
    "we suggest that models should be developed which account for the evolution of a cluster wind in a high pressure environment .",
    "we also derive spectroscopic ages and reddening for four other clusters in m82 ( b1 - 1 , b2 - 1 , f and l ) .",
    "these are consistent with earlier studies and demonstrate that star formation activity , sufficiently intense to produce super star clusters , has been going on in m82 during the past gyr , perhaps in discrete and localized episodes .",
