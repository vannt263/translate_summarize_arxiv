    "the resolved highly collimated relativistic agn jets can exhibit twisted time - dependent structures .",
    "for example , the 3c345 jet shows non - radial curved motions and accelerations that have been interpreted as motions along a helix lying on the surface of a cone @xcite , the jet in m87 shows helically twisted structures on a conical jet at parsec and hundreds of parsec scales @xcite and apparent motions from subluminal to superluminal @xcite , and the 3c120 jet exhibits subluminal and superluminal apparent motions and intensity structure that has been interpreted as a helical twist on a conically expanding jet @xcite . with the spatial and time resolution of present observations",
    ", we can begin to discern details such as the trajectory of individual components , the velocities of components and larger scale structures , and whether there are similarities between component speeds , trajectories , and larger scale structures .",
    "helical structure in relativistic jets can arise as a result of ordered variation in the flow direction at the central engine , e.g. , precession , and/or as a result of random perturbations to the jet flow , e.g , jet cloud interaction @xcite .",
    "initial perturbations propagate as waves associated with pinch , helical , elliptical etc .",
    "normal mode distortions of the jet .",
    "the helically twisted structure of a jet is dependent on the initial excited wave frequency or frequencies and initial amplitudes , and on the subsequent propagation and growth or damping of these wave frequencies along the jet .",
    "the resulting helical structure can sensitively depend on jet speed via the lorentz factor , on the sound speeds in the jet and surrounding material , and on the rate of jet expansion .    only in the past few years have time dependent relativistic hydrodynamical codes become readily available @xcite .",
    "more recently this has allowed fully 3d relativistic jet simulations to be performed with resolution sufficient to compare structure with theoretical predictions and/or with features observed in agn jets @xcite .",
    "in general , computational constraints make it very difficult to simulate and model the superluminal jets that must lie near to the line of sight .",
    "simulations need to be conducted on lengthy computational grids and store many time steps in order to account for projection and light travel time effects , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome using theoretical models based on the linearized fluid equations .",
    "that the the normal wave modes predicted by the theory operate on agn jets has been demonstrated by @xcite who successfully fitted the twisted emission threads observed in the 3c273 jet by a combination of helical and elliptical surface and internal normal modes .",
    "other similar fitting has been performed by @xcite in the context of m87 .",
    "helical twists have been used to explain the structures in 3c120 @xcite and it has been shown that superluminal motions along a curved trajectory can be explained by helical jet models , e.g. , the radio source 3c  345 @xcite . while some fitting of helically twisted structure has been performed ,",
    "no detailed self - consistent models have been constructed .",
    "modeling the emission from relativistic flows associated with the structures predicted by theory but including all relevant time delays can be used to provide the proper connection between the observations and the underlying properties of the outflows .    in this paper",
    "i present the basic behavior and appearance of a helical twist on a conical isothermal constant speed relativistic jet .",
    "i also show how the appearance of a helically twisted jet can be used to constrain the macroscopic properties of the jet and external fluid .",
    "the development of helical jet structure on a relativistic jet can be obtained using a normal mode analysis of the linearized time dependent relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "previous studies indicate that helical patterns are likely to form in relativistic jets , can induce significant transverse motion without the development of shocks , and can produce asymmetries in doppler boosted emission if jets are observed at viewing angles on the order of the beaming angle @xcite .",
    "non - relativistic numerical simulations indicate saturation of the normal wave modes of jet distortion in certain circumstances .",
    "the pinch and higher order normal wave modes grow only up to some saturation amplitude that does not lead to disruption of highly collimated jet flow @xcite .",
    "additionally , short wavelength helical twisting grows only up to some saturation amplitude that does not lead to disruption of highly collimated jet flow @xcite . in these cases",
    "the normal modes remain within the `` linear '' regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulations show that long wavelength helical twisting serves to disrupt ordered flow when the helical twist grows to non - linear amplitudes as a result of subsequent filamentation , mass entrainment and shock formation in the jet .",
    "disruption by long wavelength helical twisting can be slowed by high mach numbers , by strong magnetic fields , and by jet expansion @xcite .    within the `` linear '' non - destructive regime , helically twisted structures seen in numerical simulations",
    "have been successfully modeled by theory based on the non - relativistic mhd equations @xcite and the relativistic hd equations @xcite .",
    "this modeling showed that the theory correctly models the 3d pressure and velocity fields seen in non - relativistic and relativistic numerical simulations up to amplitudes that formally are much larger than linear , i.e. , pressure fluctuations equal to the equilibrium pressure ( @xmath0 where @xmath1 ) .",
    "since numerical simulation results indicate jet disruption by asymmetric structures at non - linear amplitudes , highly collimated jets must be operating in the linear regime as otherwise they would be disrupted by asymmetric helical structures .",
    "thus , i will assume that pressures and flow fields associated with observed jet structures can be modeled via the linear theory .",
    "the polarization in jets , except in localized structures , is typically well below the maximum value of @xmath2 .",
    "this can be taken to mean that the magnetic field in jets beyond the acceleration region is not well organized .",
    "disordered magnetic fields may provide a magnetic pressure but should not significantly influence the macroscopic normal mode structures predicted by the relativistic fluid equations .",
    "declines in synchrotron intensity along superluminal jets indicate that @xmath3 @xcite where @xmath4 represents the observed separation distance from the core .",
    "previous models of similar form typically have found power - law indices for vlbi jets ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) between -1 and -2 .",
    "vla scale jets show similar power - law indices with increasing jet width , presumably proportional to the jet radius @xcite .",
    "if we assume that this type of power - law decline scales with increasing jet radius in all cases , then this result strongly argues against adiabatic expansion .",
    "thus , as a baseline case i will assume constant speed isothermal expansion .",
    "isothermal expansion conserves energy flux for a constant jet speed .",
    "formally , this means also that the magnetic pressure is negligible .",
    "it will also be assumed that the material surrounding the jet is isothermal .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable if the jet is surrounded by a cocoon or lobe separating the jet from the ambient environment . here",
    "the jet mach number , @xmath5 , remains constant and the external mach number , @xmath6 , also remains constant with the jet in pressure balance with the external cocoon or lobe medium .",
    "the linearized fluid equations show that a helical twist is kelvin - helmholtz unstable and a helical twist propagates at a wave speed dependent on jet speed , sound speeds , and on the frequency of the wave relative to a `` resonant '' or maximally unstable frequency , @xmath7 . for sufficiently supersonic flow ,",
    "the resonant frequency is @xmath8 .",
    "the accompanying `` resonant '' wavelength depends on the wave speed .    at very low frequencies relative to the resonant frequency",
    "the wave speed is @xmath9 and the wavelength @xmath10 the spatial growth length is given by @xmath11 in the equations above @xmath12 is the lorentz factor and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the sound speeds outside and inside the jet .",

    "the wave speed and growth length remain constant as the jet expands .",
    "the wave speed changes as resonance is approached and at resonance the wave speed is ( hardee 2000 ) @xmath22^{1/2}}{[m_{ex}{}^2-v_{jt}^2/c^2]^{1/2}+\\gamma [ m_{jt}^2-v_{jt}^2/c^2]^{1/2}}~v_{jt}~.\\ ] ] the corresponding `` resonant '' wavelength is @xmath23^{1/2}m_{ex}}{[m_{ex}{}^2-v_{jt}^2/c^2]^{1/2}+\\gamma [ m_{jt}^2-v_{jt}^2/c^2]^{1/2}}r_{jt}~,\\ ] ] and the `` resonant '' spatial growth length is @xmath24 this minimum growth length is typically greater than a straight extrapolation of the low frequency result to the resonant frequency . at very high frequencies and short wavelengths relative to resonance the wave speed becomes @xmath25 and the wave propagates like a backwards moving sound wave in the reference frame of the jet fluid .",
    "the growth rate is vanishingly small in the high frequency and short wavelength limit .",
    "the analytic expressions can be used to provide limiting estimates of wave speed , wavelength and amplitude growth to be expected of a fixed frequency wave along an expanding jet .",
    "however , detailed development requires numerical solutions to the dispersion relation describing helical wave propagation and growth .",
    "solutions to this dispersion relation for a jet speed of @xmath26 , an adiabatic index of @xmath27 appropriate to a mixture of hot leptonic and cold baryonic material @xcite , and representative choice of sound speeds are shown in figure 1 .",
    "panels in figure 1 have been arranged so that the resonant frequency normalized by the jet speed and jet radius , @xmath28 , remains nearly constant along a diagonal direction .",
    "similar wave speed and wavelength behavior as a function of @xmath29 occurs along the vertical direction . for a sufficiently relativistic jet , behavior",
    "is governed entirely by the lorentz factor and sound speeds .",
    "figure 1 also shows the intrinsic and apparent wave speeds and wavelengths associated with the dispersion relation solutions where i have chosen a jet viewing angle of @xmath30 . with this assumed viewing angle and a flow lorentz factor of @xmath31^{-1/2 } \\sim 7 $ ] ,",
    "the maximum apparent superluminal speed is @xmath32 .",
    "note that at this viewing angle subluminal apparent motions occur for wave speeds @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the apparent helical wavelength in the observer frame is related to the intrinsic wavelength by @xmath35 and the intrinsic wavelength can be greater or less than the observed wavelength depending on wave speed and viewing angle . for our viewing angle ,",
    "a wave speed equal to the flow speed implies @xmath36 but when @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "when sound and jet speeds remain constant , a helical wave of fixed frequency , @xmath39 , remains at constant wavelength in the long and short wavelength regimes where the wave speed is constant .    even with constant sound and jet speeds , a helical wave of fixed frequency changes propagation speed and wavelength as @xmath40 moves from the low frequency to the high frequency regime as a result of increase in @xmath41 .",
    "change in the observed wavelength is amplified relative to change in the intrinsic wavelength , @xmath42 \\lambda(z_0)$ ] , with @xmath43 in equation ( 4 ) , @xmath44 is the intrinsic distance along the jet axis where @xmath45 is the observed distance .",
    "the analytical and numerical solutions to the dispersion relation indicate that significant change in the wavelength can occur when @xmath46 .",
    "much reduced variation occurs in observed wave speed when @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath48 implies @xmath49 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath52 ( leftmost panels in figure 1 ) .",
    "the resulting broad plateau seen in @xmath53 implies that a fixed frequency helical wave propagating along an expanding jet will appear to increase in wavelength approximately proportional to @xmath41 over the corresponding normalized frequency range , and will transition from less than to greater than the intrinsic wavelength .",
    "the corresponding normalized frequency range allows this behavior to be observed over up to two orders of magnitude of jet expansion .",
    "this wavelength change would be accompanied by a similar large change in the observed wave speed .    as a helical twist",
    "is kelvin - helmholtz unstable , the displacement amplitude of the jet surface grows according to @xmath54~,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the displacement amplitude at @xmath56 .",
    "however , the magnitude of accompanying velocity and pressure fluctuations grows according to @xmath57 , and for constant jet expansion @xmath58 \\over \\left [ 1 + ( z - z_0)\\psi / r_0 \\right]}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the jet radius at @xmath56 and @xmath60 . in the absence of non - linear stabilizing effects , @xmath61 from equation ( 1c ) in the low frequency limit",
    "is constant , begins to increase as resonance is approached and then rapidly increases at higher frequencies . for a jet to both exhibit helical",
    "twisting and remain collimated the amplitude must grow sufficiently rapidly but not so rapidly that large amplitudes are reached while the wave is in the low frequency regime . in order that the helical twist not be damped in the low frequency regime we must have that @xmath62 .",
    "scaling of the growth length proportional to the wavelength in the low frequency regime coupled to a minimum in the growth length at @xmath63 means that the maximum in @xmath57 occurs when @xmath64 .",
    "note however that constant pressure and velocity fluctuations can be maintained for decreasing @xmath57 when @xmath65 ( see  3.2 ) .    theoretically , these basic properties allow estimation of jet parameters , i.e. , sound speeds for a given lorentz factor and/or viewing angle without detailed modeling of the intensity structure .",
    "the viewing angle and flow lorentz factor are constrained by the highest observed superluminal speed , assumed related to the flow speed .",
    "lack of damping sets an upper limit to @xmath66 .",
    "a constant wavelength indicates a helical pattern in the low or high frequency limits . in the low frequency limit",
    "this sets a value for @xmath67 . in the high frequency limit",
    "this sets a value for @xmath15 .",
    "if the helical wavelength appears to scale approximately with the jet radius over some expansion range , then this can be used to set an upper limit to @xmath67 and lower limit to @xmath15 from lower and upper limits to the wave speed , respectively .",
    "examination of the fluid flow accompanying a growing helical twist on an expanding jet can be accomplished by constructing 3d theoretical data cubes using the expressions giving the pressure and velocity structure associated with the normal modes @xcite .",
    "formally , these expressions assume a cylindrical jet",
    ". however , conical jet expansion at small opening angle does not significantly modify local solutions to the dispersion relation @xcite . in",
    "what follows i adopt a jet half opening angle of @xmath68 radian that is less than the relativistic mach angle , @xmath69 , for the two cases to be considered .",
    "the flow and pressure field accompanying a helical twist can be evaluated quantitatively by taking 1-d cuts through the theoretically generated 3-d data cubes at constant values of @xmath70 as illustrated in figure 2 . for 1-d cuts in the x - z plane @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "are radial and azimuthal velocity components in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the evolution of the pressure and velocity components of frequencies @xmath73 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 for a `` hot '' jet ( @xmath74 ) with @xmath75 and for a `` warm '' jet ( @xmath76 ) with @xmath77 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "these two cases , see figure 1 , have been chosen because the resonant frequency and intrinsic wavelengths are comparable but sound speeds are significantly different . as a result ,",
    "the wave speed on the warm jet is significantly larger and growth rate on the warm jet is significantly reduced compared to the hot jet . in order to obtain similar growth with `` saturation '' amplitude occurring at a frequency @xmath78 , an initial amplitude of @xmath79 0.0007 and 0.07 is chosen for hot and warm jets , respectively .",
    "the large difference in initial amplitudes indicates an extreme sensitivity of the growth rate to the jet sound speed , i.e. , decrease in jet sound speed by a factor 2 has required an initial amplitude increase by a factor 100 .",
    "in fact @xmath80 initially declines for the low frequency wave on the warm jet .",
    "saturation is imposed when pressure fluctuations reach the maximum allowed by the linear analysis .",
    "saturation was imposed at the medium frequency on hot and warm jets and at the high frequency on the warm jet .",
    "it was found that saturation in pressure fluctuations was maintained by imposing a decrease in the displacement amplitude of the form @xmath81 when @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the real part of the wavenumber , @xmath84 corresponds to resonance and @xmath85 .",
    "the velocity fluctuations on the warm jet are @xmath86 55% of that on the hot jet for a given pressure fluctuation and the difference reflects the decrease in sound speed and increase in wave speed on the warm jet .",
    "note that jet expansion is indicated by the spread in radial velocities across the jet .",
    "while not readily apparent from these plots , the jet attempts to move bodily around the central axis .",
    "see , for example , the velocity vectors in figures 4 & 7 in @xcite that indicate uniform sideways motion of the jet fluid across a jet cross section . here sideways motion is impeded at the jet surface by the external fluid . the `` heavier '' external fluid surrounding the hot jet impedes the surface motion , relative to motion of the jet interior , more than is the case for the warm jet .",
    "note that shorter intrinsic wavelengths are associated with higher wave speed in these two cases . for a higher wave speed",
    "the fluid does not need to move as rapidly in the transverse direction to circulate through the helical pattern .",
    "this effect tends to cancel the higher circulation speed otherwise required by a shorter wavelength helical pattern .",
    "the appearance of the high pressure ridge corresponding to the low , medium and high frequency fluctuations shown in figure 3 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the images in figure 4 are line of sight integrations through 3-d pressure data cubes . in constructing the data",
    "cubes it is assumed that the pressure on the unperturbed conical jet declines as @xmath87 .",
    "only one set of images for low , medium and high frequencies is shown as hot and warm jets appeared nearly identical .",
    "for all frequencies the surface displacement of the jet is small and the images show that the high pressure ridge appears to lie within the conical jet s surface . in general , the jet fluid does not follow the path of the high pressure ridge .",
    "if we define the pitch angle of the flow by @xmath88 , then @xmath89 0.035 & 0.02 for saturation amplitudes on the hot and warm jets , respectively , where @xmath90 from figure 3 .",
    "this maximum flow pitch angle is on the order of half the relativistic mach angle , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "the helical pitch of the high pressure ridge defined by @xmath92 varies from @xmath93 at the medium frequency and @xmath94 at the high frequency as @xmath95 on both hot and warm jets . as a result of the decoupling between the pattern and fluid flow , the variation in flow angle , @xmath96 where @xmath97 , is always less than would be inferred from the helical pitch of the high pressure ridge .",
    "the brightest radio emission is expected to trace the path of the high pressure ridge . in constructing line of sight images",
    "it will be assumed that a pseudo - synchrotron emissivity at fixed frequency can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight and @xmath100^{-1}$ ] is the doppler boost factor for fluid flowing with speed @xmath101 at angle @xmath102 to the line of sight .",
    "i have used @xmath103 where @xmath104 and set @xmath105  constant .",
    "this form for the pseudo - synchrotron emissivity is necessary when the synchrotron emitting particles are not explicitly tracked @xcite . that pseudo - synchrotron intensities provide reasonable images of internal jet structures",
    "is indicated by the work of @xcite . along the conical constant velocity isothermal",
    "jet the particle number density and pressure are assumed to decline @xmath106 .",
    "the magnetic field strength is assumed to decline as @xmath107 appropriate to a disordered magnetic field @xcite .",
    "line of sight pseudo - synchrotron images corresponding to the low , medium and high frequency hot and warm jet cases shown in figures 3 & 4 are shown in figure 5 . in these images",
    "all wave motion , light travel time and doppler boosting effects appropriate to a jet at a @xmath108 viewing angle have been incorporated , and the apparent opening angle of the conical jet is @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath110,@xmath111,@xmath44 coordinate system is defined by the jet with @xmath110 in the sky plane and @xmath44 down the jet axis with the hypothetical observer located in the @xmath112 plane .",
    "comparison between figure 4 ( similar to a pseudo - synchrotron intensity image of the jet in the plane of the sky ) and figure 5 provides a striking example of the effect of wave motion and the accompanying light travel time effects on the apparent wavelength . on the hot jet",
    "the apparent wavelength varies from less than to greater than the intrinsic wavelength from low to high frequencies , respectively . on the warm jet",
    "the apparent wavelength varies from comparable to much greater than the intrinsic wavelength from low to high frequencies , respectively . at all",
    "three frequencies the longer apparent wavelength on the warm jet is the result of faster wave motion .",
    "the reduced wave speed on the hot jet and accompanying reduced apparent wavelength are sufficient to have produced intensity knots .",
    "increase in the apparent wavelength with @xmath44 at medium and high frequencies on the hot jet and at high frequency on the warm jet results from increase in the intrinsic wave speed .",
    "the existence of intensity knots and ratio of brightnesses between knot and interknot regions can be used to constrain helical flow models , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for the hot jet medium and high frequency helical twists , the intensity ratio between knot and interknot regions is @xmath113 . in general ,",
    "such intensity knots are the result of a combination of helical twist projection and doppler boosting effects where the magnitude and direction of flow is modified by high and low pressure regions . for nearly constant lorentz factor",
    ", the doppler boost factor is approximately given by @xmath114\\ ] ] where @xmath97 .",
    "along the hot conical jet with a saturated helical twist at @xmath115 the near side can be boosted relative to the far side and the bottom can be boosted relative to the top with @xmath116  radian .",
    "thus , with @xmath117 we expect @xmath118 and a maximum variation in @xmath119 of @xmath120",
    ". about half of the intensity variation results from simple projection effects and half from doppler boosting effects .",
    "the higher wave speed associated with the warm jet has reduced transverse motion and doppler boosting contrast , and the longer apparent wavelength has reduced projection effects such that intensity knots are almost eliminated .      for a single frequency excited by precession of the central engine the behavior of a helical twist is predictable over many orders of magnitude of jet expansion .",
    "difficulties arise if multiple frequencies are excited . at any location along the `` linear '' expanding jet the frequency that has grown the most will be above the local resonant frequency .",
    "this frequency reaches saturation or some lesser amplitude depending on the initial amplitude and growth rate , but could be overwhelmed by a helical wave at lower frequency that continues to grow and so on . since the resonant wavelength scales with the jet radius , we would expect to see approximate scaling with the jet radius , albeit with jumps in wavelength .",
    "perhaps the largest uncertainty in dealing with multiple frequencies lies in the interaction between multiple frequencies associated with the same wave mode .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the faster growing higher order normal modes ( elliptical , triangular etc . )",
    "do not slow the growth of a helical mode wave and decline in amplitude as the longer wavelength helical twist grows @xcite .",
    "another simulation has shown that pinch mode waves show relatively abrupt change to longer wavelength on a conically expanding axisymmetric jet @xcite .",
    "therefore i follow the simple assumption that a high frequency saturated helical wave will decline in amplitude as a lower frequency helical wave grows as specified by the linear theory .",
    "specifically i consider the hot jet with a combination of low and medium frequency waves and with a combination of low and high frequency waves .",
    "i choose the hot jet as the variation in wave speed from low to high frequencies is more extreme than on the warm jet .",
    "jet speed and opening angle remain the same as the previous single frequency models .",
    "the results of this study are shown in figure 6 .",
    "figure 6 contains plots of @xmath80 for each wave , 1-d cuts of the combined wave pressure and velocity fluctuations , and pseudo - synchrotron intensity images for the jet in the plane of the sky and for the jet at a viewing angle of @xmath121 .",
    "the combined pressure and velocity fluctuations are the result of a linear combination of fluid displacements associated with the individual waves from which the velocity components and pressure are computed .",
    "note that the pressure is not a linear combination of pressures associated with the individual waves .",
    "combined low and medium frequency waves grow from an initial @xmath122 .",
    "saturation is reached for low and medium frequency waves when the individual wave frequency is somewhat larger than twice the local resonant frequency .",

    "previously , i found @xmath125 maintained saturation for the medium frequency wave alone . for combined low and high frequency waves the high frequency wave grows from an initial @xmath126 in order to reach saturation before declining in amplitude like @xmath127 when @xmath128 .    the rapid motion of the high frequency wave leads to significant light travel time effects across the jet diameter , visible as cusps at the top of the jet , for the image corresponding to the jet in the plane of the sky .",

    "i will consider a single viewing angle of 9.6 . obviously a range of angles and computation of synchrotron intensity is needed to constrain the viewing angle but this modeling is beyond the scope of the present work . with an observed jet opening angle of @xmath171 , the true half - opening angle becomes @xmath172 . at the assumed viewing angle the true wave speed changes from low to high frequency regimes as @xmath173 and the true wavelength increases by a factor @xmath174 .",
    "the observed component spacing associated with the apparent helical wavelength would increase according to equation ( 4 ) by a factor 6.6 from component @xmath152 to component @xmath153 , or from , say , 0.4 to 2.6  mas consistent with the observed component spacing .",
    "the corresponding true wavelength , @xmath175 , varies from 0.35  pc near the core to 0.43  pc at 8.4  pc ( 2  mas observed ) from the core where the jet radius , @xmath41 , is @xmath176  pc ( @xmath177  mas ) , and @xmath178 .    a wave speed of @xmath179 in the high frequency regime and flow speed @xmath163 implies a jet sound speed @xmath180 according to equation ( 3 ) .",
    "a wave speed of @xmath181 in the low frequency regime implies @xmath182 and @xmath183 from equation ( 1a ) .",
    "these derived parameters are very similar to those used for the `` warm '' jet case shown in the previous sections .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relation solution panel in figure 1 ( @xmath184 ) clearly shows that @xmath178 is in the high frequency regime as assumed .",
    "the wavelength and wave speed inferred from the observations imply a frequency @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) at component @xmath153 ( @xmath187  pc ) .    on a strictly isothermal jet ,",
    "the dispersion relation solution implies a jet expansion by a factor @xmath188 beginning at @xmath189  pc to achieve the observed acceleration in wave speed .",
    "this position is inside component @xmath152 , has @xmath190 and implies an initial excitation at about the resonant frequency . in this case",
    "the speed of component @xmath152 may more closely represent the wave speed at resonance .",
    "unfortunately the estimated wave speed at resonance given by equation ( 2a ) is insufficiently accurate for our purposes and , in general , a numerically found value must be used . for the present parameters the wave speed at resonance is slightly less than in the low frequency regime and thus @xmath191  c would be implied .",
    "note that the inferred jet parameters allow for an apparent faster motion of components closer to the core , if the helical path could be followed / existed inside component @xmath152 .",
    "the amplitude growth curve for the high frequency helical wave on a `` warm '' jet ( figure 3 top right panel ) gives a good indication of expected wave growth for a helical wave beyond the resonant location independent of the exact location or mechanism for the initial perturbation .",
    "here we have a resonant location @xmath192  pc where @xmath193  pc .",
    "saturation from an initial amplitude @xmath194 can easily be achieved by @xmath195  pc ( @xmath196  mas ) where the saturation amplitude is @xmath197 .",
    "the present work has shown that helical structure can be sensitive to jet and external medium conditions .",
    "this sensitivity manifests itself in predictable changes in wave speed , wavelength and growth rate along an expanding jet .",
    "the basic behavior of a non - disruptive `` linear '' helical twist is summarized below :    1 .",
    "the wave speed varies , typically between limits set by the value of @xmath67 at low and @xmath15 at high frequencies , relative to a resonant frequency , @xmath198 , at which the growth rate is largest .",
    "2 .   the accompanying long and short wavelength regimes scale relative to the resonant wavelength @xmath199/[\\gamma ( m_{jt}^2 -1)^{1/2 } + ( m_{ex}^2 - 1)^{1/2 } ] \\ } m_{ex } r_{jt}$ ] .",
    "the spatial growth length scales @xmath200 .",
    "a helical twist is damped along an expanding jet if @xmath66 is too large .",
    "4 .   typically , a fixed frequency helical wave propagates from the low frequency to high frequency regimes by virtue of jet expansion . 5 .   given equal excitation of multiple frequencies at a position @xmath56",
    "the strongest helical pattern at @xmath44 will be at a frequency @xmath201 and wavelength @xmath202 .",
    "modeling the detailed flow and pressure structure accompanying a helical twist shows the highest pressures to be near the surface of the jet . in general",
    "the jet fluid does not follow the helical path of the high pressure ridge .",
    "the correspondence between jet surface displacement , and pressure and velocity structure is summarized below :    1 .",
    "a given pressure fluctuation induces a larger velocity fluctuation for higher jet sound speed .",
    "2 .   surface displacements accompanying similar levels of pressure fluctuation are larger for lower jet sound speeds but remain relatively small on relativistic flows .",
    "maintaining a saturation amplitude implies a decrease in the surface displacement as @xmath115 .",
    "4 .   at saturation",
    "amplitudes the jet center is at higher speed and lower pressure than the jet surface .",
    "axial velocity fluctuations are largest near the jet surface .",
    "transverse velocity fluctuations are largest in the jet interior .",
    "the maximum helical flow pitch angle is less than the relativistic mach angle and always less than the helical pressure ridge pitch angle .",
    "the present work shows how projection and light travel time effects profoundly influence the appearance of helical twisting for jets at small viewing angles .",
    "this extreme sensitivity should allow the determination of jet and external medium properties , albeit it is essential to have proper motion information in order to constrain the observed jet s speed and orientation .",
    "the brightest radio emission is expected to be generated in the region of highest pressure so observations will trace the path of the high pressure ridge . on an expanding relativistic jet the theoretically predicted patterns are like those that would be expected if the jet intensity were enhanced along a helical path on a conical surface .",
    "the brightest regions are where the helical path approaches closer to the viewing angle .",
    "the brightness is enhanced by foreshortening and by doppler boosting , albeit by less than would be assumed from the pitch angle of the high pressure ridge .",
    "the observed appearance of a helical twist is summarized below :    1 .   short wavelength twists in the high frequency regime travel at nearly the jet speed . on superluminal jets",
    "their apparent wavelength will be longer than the intrinsic wavelength .",
    "2 .   for a fixed frequency helical",
    "wave the apparent wavelength change is amplified by @xmath203 relative to the intrinsic wavelength change @xmath204 . as a result @xmath205 can appear @xmath206 as a jet expands if @xmath207 .",
    "3 .   multiple frequencies can produce @xmath208 on average and can produce very different apparent motions at comparable locations .",
    "the motion of components in the 3c120 jet inside 10  mas may serve as an example of the predicted helical wave behavior on an expanding relativistic jet . at an assumed viewing angle of 9.6  the observed component motions",
    "would indicate an isothermal jet expansion with jet sound speed @xmath209  c and sound speed in the medium immediately outside the jet @xmath210  c. additional modeling work is planned to constrain the viewing angle and evaluate the robustness of these estimates .",
    "it is anticipated that detailed modeling of observed helical structure on jets with observed proper motions will provide strong constraints on jet and external sound speeds , and on the perturbation frequencies that arise from or near to the central engine .",
    "note that considerably different wave speed and wavelength behavior is associated with , for example , the present assumed isothermal as opposed to an adiabatic expansion .",
    "thus , modeling results have direct implications for particle energization / heating rates and indirectly for particle acceleration rates .",
    "the finding of say high jet sound speed implies the lack of a `` cold '' baryonic jet component and may provide constraints on the composition of jet material , i.e. , electron - proton dominated or electron - positron dominated as some polarization observations can be taken to imply ( wardle et al .  1998 ; celotti et al .",
