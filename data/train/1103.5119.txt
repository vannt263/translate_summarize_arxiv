    "in this paper , we present a protocol to manage communications between tiles of a tiling of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "why the hyperbolic plane ? because the geometry of this space allows to implement there any tree structure .",
    "the reason for that is that the simplest tilings defined in this plane are spanned by a tree .",
    "we refer to the author s papers and books on this topic , see  @xcite .",
    "tree structures are already intensively used in computer science , especially by operating systems .",
    "but the fact that trees are naturally embedded in this geometrical space , especially on tilings living there , was never used .",
    "this paper proposes to take advantage of this property .    in section  [ geom ]",
    ", we remind what is needed of hyperbolic geometry in order the reader could understand the content of the paper .    in section  [ geom ]",
    ", we remind what is needed of hyperbolic geometry in order the reader could understand the content of the paper . in section  [ navigation ] , we sketchily describe the navigation technique with a new aspect which was not used in  @xcite . in section  [ scenario ] , we present the protocol which allows us to improve the system briefly mentioned in  @xcite . in section  [ program ] , we give an account of the simulation program and in section  [ experiment ] we present the experiment which was performed by running the simulation program . in section  [ conclusion ] , we conclude with further possible development of the scenario implemented by the protocol .",
    "our first sub - section reminds the poincar s disc model which allows us to have a partial visualization of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "our second sub - section defines the simplest tilings which can there be defined , allowing us to construct * grids*. in our third sub - section , we focus on the tiling on which our proposal is based , the tiling @xmath1 of the hyperbolic plane which we call the * heptagrid*.      hyperbolic geometry appeared in the first half of the 19@xmath2 century , proving the independence of the parallel axiom of euclidean geometry . this was the end of a search during two thousand years in order to prove that the well known axiom about parallels in euclid s treatise is a consequent of his other axioms .",
    "the search is by itself a very interesting story , full of deep teachings of high price for the philosophy of sciences , we recommend the interested reader to have a look at  @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic geometry was the first issue of the notion of axiomatic independence .",
    "but also , it raised the first doubts on the absolute power of our abstract mind .",
    "it opened the way to the foundational works of mathematical logics , so that computer science , the daughter of logics , appears to be a grand - child of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the paper hopes to show that this kind of relations holds not only on a philosophical ground .",
    "the search failed .",
    "this was proved in the second third of the 19@xmath2 century by the discovery of hyperbolic geometry . in this new geometry ,",
    "all the non - parallel axioms of euclidean old and , from a point  @xmath3 out of a line  @xmath4 and in the plane defined by  @xmath4 and  @xmath3 there are two parallels to  @xmath4 passing through  @xmath3 . around forty",
    "years after the discovery , models of the new geometry in the euclidean one were found . presently , we turn to the most popular model of the hyperbolic plane nowadays , poincar s model .",
    "this model is represented by figure  [ poincare_disc ] . in the model ,",
    "the points of the hyperbolic plane are represented by the points of an open disc fixed in advance called the * unit disc*. the circle which is the boundary of the disc is called the set of * points at infinity * and we denote it by  @xmath5 .",
    "these points do not belong to the hyperbolic plane , but they play an important role in this geometry .",
    "the lines of the hyperbolic plane are represented by the trace in the disc of its diameters or by the trace in the disc of circles which are orthogonal to  @xmath5 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the lines are also characterized in the models by their points at infinity as diameters of the disc and circles orthogonal to  @xmath5 meet @xmath5 twice exactly .",
    "the figure also shows us an important feature of the new plane : outside parallel and secant lines to a given line  @xmath4 , passing through a point  @xmath3 not on  @xmath4 , there are also lines passing through  @xmath3 which do not cut  @xmath4 , neither inside the disc , nor on  @xmath5 and nor outside the disc : they are called * non - secant * lines . a last but not least property of the new plane is that there are no similarity : a figure of this plane can not be re sized at another scale . resizing necessarily changes the shape of the figure .",
    "consider the following process .",
    "we start from a convex regular polygon  @xmath7 .",
    "we replicate @xmath7  in its sides and , recursively , the images in their sides .",
    "if we cover the plane without overlapping , then we say that @xmath7 * tiles the plane by tessellation*. we shall often say for short that @xmath7 * tiles the plane * , here , the hyperbolic plane .",
    "a theorem proved by poincar in 1882 tells us that if  @xmath7 has @xmath8  sides and if its interior angle is @xmath9 , then @xmath7 tiles the hyperbolic plane , provided that : to the numbers @xmath8 and  @xmath10 characterize the tiling which is denoted @xmath6 and the condition says that the considered polygons live in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "this inequality entails that there are infinitely many tessellations of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the tessellation attached to @xmath8 and  @xmath10 satisfying the inequality is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "note that we find the well known euclidean tessellations if we replace @xmath11 by  @xmath12 in the above expression .",
    "we get , in this way , @xmath13 for the square , @xmath14 for the equilateral triangle and @xmath15 for the regular hexagon .    in  @xcite",
    ", the author provides the reader with a uniform treatment of these tessellations .",
    "the basic feature is that each tessellations is spanned by a tree whose structure obeys well defined properties .",
    "we shall illustrate these points in our next sub - section where we focus on a particular tessellation : the tiling @xmath1 of the hyperbolic plane which we call the * heptagrid*.      the heptagrid is illustrated by figure  [ til73 ] .",
    "the figure is very symmetric , but at this stage , it is difficult to identify each tile of the figure , especially for the tiles which are outside the first two rings around the central cell .",
    "the tiles look very much the hexagonal tiles of the corresponding tessellation of the euclidean plane , but the global organization is very different .",
    "it seems to us that this figure indicates that we need something to locate the tiles .",
    "we turn to this point in section  [ navigation ]",
    "we have seen on the heptagrid that it is not easy to locate the tiles of this tiling , especially as we go further and further from the centre of the disc .",
    "this is the point to draw the attention of the reader on two points .",
    "the disc model may be misleading if we forget that we are in the euclidean plane and that some symmetries of the figure have no counter part in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "as an example , the central tile seems to play an important role , in particular its centre .",
    "however , the hyperbolic plane has no central point as well as the euclidean plane has no such point .",
    "we decide to fix an origin when we define coordinates in the euclidean plane .",
    "this is the same here .",
    "the central tile is simply a tile which we decide to be the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "the second point is that poincar s disc model gives us a local picture only .",
    "we see the immediate neighbourhood of a point which we decided to place at the centre of the disc .",
    "the models looks like a small window on the hyperbolic plane whose central part only is well observable . from this lens effect , we conclude that walking on the hyperbolic plane , we are in the situation of the pilot of a plane flying with instruments only .    and so , what are our instruments ?",
    "the first two pictures of figure  [ tree_73 ] represent them . on the left - hand side of the figure",
    ", we can seen the * mid - point lines * defined by the following property : the line which joins the mid - points of two consecutive sides of a heptagon cuts a heptagon of the tiling at the mid - point of a side only .",
    "if we consider two rays issued from the meeting point of two secant mid - point lines and defined by the smallest angle , we can define a set of tiles for which all vertices but possibly one or two lie inside this angle .",
    "we call this the restriction of the tiling to a sector .",
    "the remarkable property is that the restriction of the tiling to a sector is spanned by a tree , the tree which is illustrated by the right - hand side of the figure . in the middle of the figure",
    ", we can see that the whole tiling can exactly be split into a central cell and seven sectors dispatched around the central tile .",
    "the tree which spans the tiling can be generated by very simple rules indicating the exact connection between a node and its sons .",
    "there are two kind of nodes , the * black * and the * white * ones .",
    "the rules are , in self - explaining notations : to from these rules , it can be proved that the number of nodes which are on the level  @xmath16 of the tree is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fibonacci sequence defined by @xmath19 and the induction equation . for this reason , the tree",
    "is called the * fibonacci tree*.    it is known that natural numbers can be represented as sums of distinct terms of the fibonacci sequence : @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "this representation is not unique , but it can be made unique by requiring @xmath24  to be maximal in the above representation .",
    "this is the * greedy fibonacci * representation of  @xmath16 .",
    "it is characterized by the fact that considering the @xmath25 s in their order as a word on @xmath26 , there are no contiguous  1 s in the word .    presently , number the nodes of the tree level by level and , on each level , from the left to the right , starting from the root which receives  1 as its number .",
    "next , call * coordinate * of a node  @xmath27 the greedy fibonacci representation of its number . then the coordinates of the nodes of the tree",
    "have this striking property .",
    "if @xmath28 $ ] is the coordinate of  @xmath27 , among the sons of  @xmath27 there is a single node whose coordinate is  @xmath2800 $ ] , which is called the * preferred son*. also , we can rewrite  ( 2 ) as  ( 3 ) to where the bar indicates the position of the preferred son .    a * path * between a tile  @xmath3 and a tile  @xmath29 is a sequence @xmath30}$ ] with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and , for each @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 and  @xmath35 have a common side .",
    "we say that @xmath16  is the length of the path and we note that from this definition , the path is oriented : its * source * is the tile @xmath36 and its * target * is the tile  @xmath37 .",
    "we also say that the path goes from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , a path from  @xmath29 to  @xmath3 is obtained by reversing the numbering of the @xmath35 s defining the path from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 .    for complexity reasons ,",
    "it is convenient to take a * shortest * path between  @xmath3 and  @xmath29 : it is a path between  @xmath3 and  @xmath29 whose length is minimal .",
    "note that in general there is no unique shortest path but , by the very definition , such a path exists .",
    "an important particular case is when both tiles are on the same branch of a tree : this part of the branch is a shortest path between the tiles .    from the properties of the preferred son , we obtain :    [ pathlin ] ( see@xcite )",
    "there is an algorithm which computes the path from a node of the fibonacci tree to the root from the coordinate of the node which is linear in the size of the coordinate .    from this algorithm ,",
    "it is easy to compute a path between two nodes which is most often almost a shortest path between the nodes : first , go from the nodes to the root and connect the two paths at the root .",
    "moreover , the computation is linear in the size of the two coordinates .",
    "however , in certain situations , this is not the shortest way .",
    "now , in  @xcite , we proved a refinement of theorem  [ pathlin ] . in order to state it properly",
    ", we have to define coordinates for the tiles of the heptagrid .    to do this , we look at the middle picture of figure  [ tree_73 ] .",
    "we increasingly number the sectors from  1 up to  7 by counter - clockwise turning around the central cell , fixing the sector which receives number  1 once and for all .",
    "now , the coordinate of a tile is defined by  0 for the central tile and , for any other tile  @xmath38 , by the couple  @xmath39 where @xmath40 defines the sector which contains the tile and where  @xmath27 is the coordinate of  @xmath38 in the tree which spans the sector .",
    "now , we can state the result :    [ strongpathlin ] ( see@xcite ) there is an algorithm which computes a shortest path between two tiles of the heptagrid which is linear in the size of the coordinates of the tiles .",
    "another consequence of theorem  [ pathlin ] is the computation of the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile , where a neighbour of the tile  @xmath38 is a tile  @xmath41 which shares a side with  @xmath38 .",
    "clearly , @xmath38 is also a neighbour of  @xmath38 and we shall often say that  @xmath41 and  @xmath38 are neighbours .",
    "the computation of the coordinates of the neighbours relies on two functions of  @xmath16 , the number of a tile : @xmath42 which is the number of the father of the tile and @xmath43 which is the number of the preferred son of the tile . according to the previous notations , it is also interesting to consider the function  @xmath44 $ ] such that and the function @xmath45 $ ] such that . from the proof of theorem  [ pathlin ]",
    ", there is an algorithm which allows to compute @xmath44 $ ] and  @xmath45 $ ] which is linear in the size of  @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "however , note that in the computation of the path the application of the algorithm at one step is in fact a constant . with the help of this function ,",
    "the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile are given by tables  [ neigha ] and  [ neighb ] .",
    "in the table , the neighbours of a tile  @xmath38 are increasingly numbered from  1 to  7 while counter - clockwise turning around  @xmath38 .",
    "neighbour  1 is the father of  @xmath38 .",
    "the father of a root is the central tile . for the central tile ,",
    "the neighbour  @xmath47 is the tile associated to the root of the tree in the sector  @xmath47 .",
    "if  @xmath47 is the number of a neighbour of  @xmath38 , we say that the side shared by  @xmath38 and this neighbour is also numbered by  @xmath47 .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 to    table  [ neigha ] considers the general case , when the node associated to the tile is inside the tree .",
    "this means that the corresponding node always has its father in the tree and that all its neighbours are also in the tree . in table",
    "[ neighb ] , we have the exceptional cases . the nodes on the leftmost branch , the root excepted , and those which are on the rightmost branch , the root excepted .",
    "the nodes of the rightmost branch are white and the root is also white . the nodes on the leftmost branch , the root excepted , are black .",
    "it remains to indicate that in the case of a heptagon  @xmath48 which is on the left- or the rightmost branch , it is easy to define the number of the sector to which belongs the neighbours which do not belong to the tree of  @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath49  be the number of the sector in which @xmath48  lies .",
    "if @xmath48  is a black node , its neighbours  2 and  3 are in the sector @xmath50 , where @xmath51@xmath0@xmath52 when @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath48  is a white node , its neighbours  6 and  7 are in the sector @xmath55 with @xmath56+@xmath52 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that for the root of the sector  @xmath49 , its neighbour  2 is in the sector @xmath50 and its neighbour  1 is the central cell which is outside all the sectors .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 to    both theorems  [ pathlin ] and  [ strongpathlin ] give an algorithm to compute new coordinates if we change the place of the central tile to another tile . in section  [ program ]",
    ", we briefly give an explicit pseudo code implementing an algorithm satisfying theorem  [ strongpathlin ] .",
    "the computation of the functions @xmath59 and  @xmath49 used in the computation of the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile are also used for this purpose and based on these considerations and on the previous results we have that :    [ chgcoord ] ( see  @xcite ) consider a system of coordinate and a tile  @xmath38 .",
    "assume that we take  @xmath38 as the central tile and that we fix its new side  @xmath52 .",
    "there is an algorithm which , for each tile  @xmath60 computes the coordinates of  @xmath60 in the new system in linear time in the size of the coordinate in the initially given system .",
    "it is important to remark that in order to obtain the linearity of the algorithm , we do not compute the functions  @xmath59 and  @xmath49 but @xmath44 $ ] and  @xmath45 $ ] applied to  @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this means that in order to compute @xmath43@xmath0@xmath52 for instance , we need an algorithm for computing @xmath61@xmath0@xmath62 $ ] from  @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "a similar remark holds for @xmath61+@xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the needed algorithms can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ introduction ] , we mentioned that in  @xcite , we already proposed a communication protocol for the tiles of the heptagrid .",
    "this protocol was based on a specific system of coordinates , inherited from  @xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    ", we briefly describe this system in sub - section  [ absolrel ] .",
    "then , in sub - section  [ protocol ] we define the new protocol .",
    "the * absolute * system is based on a numbering of the sides tiles of the heptagrid . for each tile , we number the sides from  1 to  7 in this order while counter - clockwise turning around the tile .",
    "now , how to fix side  1 ?",
    "we again take the situation of the left - hand side of figure  [ tree_73 ] : a central cell surrounded by seven sectors , each one spanned by a copy of the fibonacci tree .",
    "now , side  1 is fixed once and for all for the central tile . for the other tiles , side  1",
    "is the side shared by the tile and its father , considering that the central cell is the father of the root for each copy of the fibonacci tree spanning the sectors .",
    "now , a side always belongs to two tiles and so it receives two numbers .",
    "this is why this numbering is called * local*. however , the association between both numbers is not arbitrary .",
    "there is a correspondence between them although it is not one to one .",
    "when one number is known , the status of the tile and the fact that the corresponding node whether lies or not on an extremal branch of the tree are also needed to determine the other number .",
    "this correspondence is given by table  [ sidenumbers ] and table  [ thepairs ] lists all the couples used by the sides : note that we are far from using all possible couples .",
    "the absolute system consists in first fixing the local numbering once and for all .",
    "table  [ sidenumbers ] will still be used to determine the two numbers of a side of a heptagon .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 to    next , we remark that the local numbering gives a way to encode a path between two tiles  @xmath3 and  @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30}$ ] be a shortest path from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 and denote by @xmath64 the side shared by @xmath35 and  @xmath65 for @xmath66@xmath0@xmath62 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number of @xmath64 in  @xmath35 and @xmath67 be its number in @xmath65 .",
    "then we say that the sequence @xmath68}$ ] is an * address * of  @xmath29 * from *  @xmath3 .",
    "the reverse sequence gives an address of  @xmath3 from  @xmath29 .",
    "however , on the just above sequence , we do not know from the sequence itself that @xmath69 is the last side . in order to do this",
    ", we change a bit the association of the numbers : for @xmath35 belonging to the path , we denote by  @xmath70 the side shared with @xmath34 and by  @xmath71 the side shared with  @xmath65 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "as @xmath72 can not be defined as the number of a neighbour of  @xmath36 , we put @xmath73 . this time",
    "we say that the sequence @xmath74}$ ] is the * coordinate * of @xmath29 from  @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the sequence @xmath75}$ ] is the coordinate of  @xmath3 from  @xmath29 . and",
    "so , the correspondence between the address and the coordinate is easy : @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath66@xmath0@xmath62 $ ] which contains the definitions of  @xmath78 and  @xmath79 .",
    "now , how to define a shortest path between @xmath3 and  @xmath29 ?    there are two ways : the first way is given by theorem  [ strongpathlin ] .",
    "we apply the algorithm defined in section  [ program ] in order to find the coordinate of @xmath3 from  @xmath29 .",
    "the second way consists in the following .",
    "if @xmath3  sends messages to every tile , it considers itself as the central tile , taking its own number  1 as the number  1 of the central cell .",
    "remember that all tiles have the same size , the same shape and the same area , this is why each tile may feels equal to the others .",
    "when it sends the message to its neighbours , it also send them the information that it is the central cell and it sends @xmath80 to its neighbour  @xmath47 .",
    "and so , the neighbour receives its coordinate from  @xmath3 . by induction",
    ", we assume that each tile  @xmath38 which receives the message from  @xmath3 also receives its coordinate from  @xmath3 and its status in the relative tree to  @xmath3 in which @xmath38  is . from this information , and as  @xmath38 knows from which neighbour it receives the message , @xmath38 know which of its neighbours are its relative sons and so , it can append the element @xmath81 to the address it conveys to the corresponding son together with the relative status of the son .",
    "and so , we proved that each tile receiving a message from  @xmath3 also receives its address from  @xmath3 and its relative status with respect to  @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , we have an implementation of the local numbering attached to  @xmath3 as a central tile .",
    "this local numbering is called the * relative * system .",
    "now , from its coordinate from  @xmath3 , @xmath38  may computes the coordinate of  @xmath3 from  @xmath38 in a linear time in the size of the coordinate , as follows from what we already have noticed . and",
    "so , if @xmath38  wishes to reply to the message sent by  @xmath3 it can do it easily . moreover , from the properties we have seen in section  [ navigation ] , we can see that , proceeding in the just described way , a public message is sent to every tile once exactly , which is an important feature .",
    "we have now the tools to describe the protocol of communication between the tiles .",
    "for this protocol , we distinguish two types of messages , * public * ones and * private * ones . by definition ,",
    "a public message is a message sent by a tile to all the other tiles .",
    "a private message is a message sent by a tile to a single other one .",
    "this distinction belongs to the sender of the message . in this protocol",
    ", we assume that we have a global clock defining a discrete time and that a message leaving a tile  @xmath38 at time  @xmath82 can reach only a neighbour of  @xmath38 at time  @xmath82 + 1 .",
    "we say that the maximal speed for a message is  1 .",
    "the public message makes use of the relative system of the sender .",
    "however , in the coordinates which are constructed by the tiles which relay the message , the numbers @xmath70 and  @xmath71 computed by the relaying tile are defined according to the absolute system as the tile does not know where is the sender and as its own local numbering is defined by the absolute system .",
    "a private message is either a reply to a message , either public or private , or a message sent to a single tile according to the following procedure .",
    "each tile  @xmath38 has a direct access to a the system .",
    "given the coordinates of a tile  @xmath41 as defined in section  [ navigation ] , the central cell being that of the absolute system , the managing system gives to  @xmath38 a shortest path from  @xmath38 to  @xmath41 which is a coordinate of  @xmath41 from  @xmath38 .",
    "and so , a private message is defined by the fact that it has the address of the receiver .",
    "# 1 # 2 to    in order to deliver the information efficiently , a private message from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 stores the coordinate of  @xmath29 as two stacks  @xmath83 and  @xmath84 .",
    "the stack  @xmath83 is for the direct run from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 , the stack  @xmath85 is for the way back .",
    "each tile  @xmath38 on the path conveys the message to the next one  @xmath41 on the path , in the direction from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 . to perform this",
    ", @xmath38 reads the top of  @xmath83 , say @xmath86 .",
    "it knows that  @xmath87 is the number of  @xmath41 from itself . just before sending  @xmath41 the message and the stacks , @xmath38  pops the top @xmath86 of  @xmath83 and pushes @xmath88 on the top of  @xmath84 . in this way",
    ", @xmath38 knows that it is the receiver if @xmath89 .",
    "when this is the case , @xmath38  pops the top @xmath86 of  @xmath83 , pushes @xmath88 on  @xmath84 but does nothing else .",
    "note that at this moment @xmath83  is empty . when  @xmath38 is ready to answer , it exchange  @xmath83 and  @xmath84 and so",
    ", the same process allows the message to reach  @xmath3 together with a coordinate of  @xmath29 from  @xmath3 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ bobandalice ] on a toy example .",
    "it is easy to see that this process is linear in time with respect to the coordinate of the receiver , assuming that all messages travel at maximal speed  1 .",
    "now , we shall see that in the process of a public message , the computation by the relaying tile of the new information which it has to append to the message is easily computed . here",
    "two , we have two stacks , but the stack  @xmath84 is always empty .    consider a relaying tile  @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the top of the stack  @xmath83 . by construction",
    ", @xmath78  is the side of the neighbour  @xmath41 through which  @xmath38 received the message . in order to facilitate the computation",
    ", @xmath38 also receives the number  @xmath91 in  @xmath38 of the side numbered  @xmath78 in  @xmath41 .",
    "let  @xmath92 be the number of the relative son of  @xmath38 in the relative tree .",
    "we know that @xmath93 $ ] if @xmath38 is white in the relative tree and that @xmath94 $ ] if  @xmath38 is black in the relative tree .",
    "this index corresponds to a position of the father at the absolute index  1 .",
    "now , the absolute index  @xmath95 of the son defined by  @xmath92 is given by : to once @xmath95 is known , the other absolute number of the side defined by  @xmath95 , say @xmath96 , may be determined by table  [ thepairs ] .",
    "now , we know that when @xmath97 , @xmath96  is not uniquely defined . the value of  @xmath96 depends on the absolute status of  @xmath38 .",
    "the simplest solution is to assume that all pairs  @xmath98 for @xmath99 are known for each tile  @xmath38 in a table  _ output _ which is a sub - table of table  [ thepairs ] , see section  [ program ] for the implementation of this important point .",
    "then we have :    to for implementation , note that the root of the relative sector  1 for a sender is its absolute neighbour  1 .",
    "also note that formula  ( 4 ) is different from the formula given in  @xcite . in formula  ( 4 ) , we do not need to know the relative status of the tile , contrarily to the formula used in  @xcite .",
    "this is automatically given by the relative indices used for the relative sons .",
    "however , we can not assume that all tiles send messages at any time .",
    "this would not be realistic .",
    "also , we can not assume that public messages are sent for ever to cover the whole plane which would also not be realistic .",
    "indeed , in case of public messages sent without stopping , the number of messages at any tile at each time would increase to infinity at an exponential rate with time .",
    "in order to limit the scope of a public message , we define a * radius * of its propagation .",
    "this means that if a public message is sent from  @xmath3 , it will reach any tile whose distance from  @xmath3 is at most the radius .",
    "the distance between two tiles  @xmath3 and  @xmath29 is the length of a shortest path between  @xmath3 and  @xmath29 . of course",
    ", the message could also bring with it the delay which could be decremented by  1 each time it reaches a new tile , and the message would destroy itself when the delay would be  0 .",
    "the defect of this solution is that we have to transport the delay to all tiles within the radius and that at each time , we have to perform this decrementing at each tile .",
    "there is another solution .",
    "when @xmath3 sends a public message with radius  @xmath84 , the message is not sent at maximal speed  1 but at a speed  @xmath100 .",
    "as we have a global clock , we shall distinguish between odd and even times .",
    "a public message travels at odd times and remains on the tile at even times .",
    "consider the message  @xmath101 sent from  @xmath3 at time  1 .",
    "now , @xmath3 must remember  @xmath101 and this is implemented as another message  @xmath102 which is not sent immediately . the new message has the minimal information .",
    "it has to destroy  @xmath101 and only  @xmath101 . to this purpose ,",
    "all messages are identified by a unique number given by the system . and",
    "so , @xmath102 contains the number of  @xmath101 .",
    "next , @xmath3 keeps  @xmath102 during @xmath84  tops of the clock .",
    "in fact , @xmath102 also keeps a delay which is  @xmath84 when @xmath102 is created and which is decremented at each top of the clock . when the delay is  0 , @xmath102 is sent to all tiles , according to the same process as a public message , but at speed  1 .",
    "also , another important difference is that  @xmath102 does not need to transport a stack as it is not sent in order to get any reply .",
    "as @xmath102 travels at speed  1 , at time  @xmath103 , it reaches @xmath101 and it destroys it . later on we shall say that @xmath102 is an * erasing * message .    with this",
    ", we completed the description of the process concerning public messages .",
    "private messages always travel at speed  1 .    a last point for the simulation : as a tile does not send a message at any time , we have to decide when it sends a message . for this purpose",
    ", we use a poisson generator , both for the decision of sending a message and , in the case of a public message , for defining the radius of the propagation of the message . for each parameter",
    ", we use a different coefficient for the generator .",
    "we shall see the values in section  [ experiment ] .",
    "as usual for the implementation of a theoretical model , the simulation program results from many choices decided by the programmer for the implementation of various features , in particular , the structure representing the space of the simulation , we shall see this point in subsection  [ data ] .",
    "subsection  [ auxil ] is devoted to auxiliary computations connected with the implementation of the basic algorithms .",
    "subsection  [ scenar ] describes the exact implementation of the scenario described in section  [ protocol ] .",
    "the simulation program was written in @xmath104 . when this is the case , we mention facilities given by the programming language .      in a first stage of the experiments described in section",
    "[ experiment ] , the heptagrid was implemented as a table space with two entries : one in 0 .. 7 and the other in 0 .. maxsize , where maxsize is the number of tiles of a sector represented by the simulation , the sector  @xmath47 , with @xmath105 $ ] being represented by space(i , * ) . from section  [ navigation ] , it is not difficult to compute that up to the level  @xmath16 , the number of tiles in a sector is @xmath106@xmath0@xmath52 .",
    "the elements of the table are a small table of 8 records indexed from  0 to  8 .",
    "record  0 represents the tile space@xmath98 : it is the tile  @xmath38 of coordinate @xmath98 with @xmath105 $ ] and .",
    "record  @xmath107 , with @xmath108 $ ] represents the neighbour  @xmath107 of  @xmath38 .",
    "the fields of the record contain the information needed to minimize the computation time . except the coordinate of the tile and of its neighbours ,",
    "the record is assumed to contain an information of constant size .    presently , in order to overcome a quick overflow by the manipulation of the table , the space of the experiment is implemented by stacks .",
    "there is a basic table space with a single entry in 0 .. 7 which represents the central cell and the roots of the fibonacci trees .",
    "each element of the table is a pointer , addresstile which points at a tile .",
    "the pointer in space(0 ) points at the central cell , space(@xmath47 ) , with points at the root of the sector  @xmath47 .",
    "the tiles themselves are represented by a record whose fields are :    the stack of messages contains what is needed for the communication system .",
    "each element of the stack holds a record with the following fields :    now , why two pointers at the stack of messages ?    this is to perform the simulation in the following way . at each tile",
    ", we represent the stack of messages by two disjoint stacks : stack0 , accessed through message_stack0 and last_message0 , and stack1 , accessed through the pointers message_stack1 and last_message1 .",
    "we consider that stack0 represents the stack at the tile at the time  @xmath82 while stack1 represents the stack at the same tile but at the time  @xmath82 + 1 .",
    "the disjunction of stack0 with respect to stack1 avoid any confusion of pointers . and this disjunction is needed as a tile possibly receives contributions from its neighbours and this is performed sequentially by the simulation , whence the distinction between the two configurations of the same stack at the time  @xmath82 and at the time  @xmath82 + 1 : the same tile receives contribution from its neighbours at different steps of the sequential process within the steps of computation which represent the turning from the time  @xmath82 to the time  @xmath82 + 1",
    ".      the computation of the shortest path is given by a simple algorithm which hides more involved computations , although they remain within a linear estimate with a small coefficient , see  [ shortest ] . among the shortest paths from the tile  @xmath3 to the tile  @xmath29 , there are two extremal ones : if we consider the  @xmath3 as the central cell , @xmath29 lies in a sector  @xmath47 and the the path from @xmath3 to  @xmath29 which passes through the root of the sector and going along the branch of the tree from the root to  @xmath29 is one of these extremal paths : there is no other shortest path on the left - hand side of this path while looking at  @xmath29 and the root with @xmath29 below the root . if we start from  @xmath29 as the central cell",
    ", we get the other extremal path : no shortest to the right - hand side of this one .",
    "now , when we have at our disposal a shortest path  @xmath109 , say from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 , it is possible to define the leftmost shortest path from  @xmath3 to  @xmath29 .",
    "this path is computed thanks to the procedure measure which computes the distance between two paths .",
    "it also relies on a function pathroot which computes the path from a node to the root from the coordinate of the node .",
    "it uses a function leftmost which computes the leftmost shortest path when it is given a shortest path .",
    "the function pathroot is a significantly improved version of the algorithm given in  @xcite , giving a much simpler proof of theorem  [ pathlin ] .",
    "the key point was to notice that there is a kind of propagation of the carry when for the first time to contiguous  1 s are detected : test in the else - branch of the main if of the loop .",
    "when starting the execution of function shortest , both paths start from the central cell as indicated by the instructions which initialize lcursor and rcursor . as suggested by the identifiers , lcursor points at the leftmost tiles between tile1 and tile2 .",
    "the function theleftmost looks whether the points belong to the same sector of not .",
    "if not , the absolute difference between the indices of the sectors allows us to know the leftmost tile . if they are in the same sector , then the function follows both paths from the root to the nodes until the paths diverge as we assume that the tiles are distinct . at the tile which is the point where both paths diverge , it is easy to determine which tile is on the left - hand side of the other .",
    "when the leftmost tile is determined , then the function first computes the path from ltile to the central cell and then the leftmost path from rtile to the central cell . in this way",
    ", we already know that the distance between the paths is at most  1 as long as possible . in the loop which starts form the central tile , the distance between the tiles of the path at the current stage",
    "is measured by the procedure measure which updates distance which outputs the computed distance . if one path is completely traversed or if the distance is now bigger than  1 , the loop is completed and both pointers point at the furthest tile from the central tile where the distance is at most  1",
    ". then the function connect establishes the necessary path in order to join both remaining parts of the paths in the shortest way : it is a finite selection of cases in each of which the construction is easy .",
    "this point raises no difficulty .",
    "the procedure  measure is detailed by algorithm  [ measure ] .",
    "it takes into account that the leftmost path which joins the central cell to the rightmost tile may lie on the left - hand side of the path joining the leftmost tile .",
    "this is why we have this selection of cases into three of them denoted by equal , when the distance is  0 , normal when the distance is  1 and the tile on lmark is on the left - hand side of the tile on rmark , and opposite when the distance is  1 and the tile on lmark is on the right - hand side of the tile on rmark .",
    "such cases do happen .",
    "note that the case opposite is structurally very similar to the case normal .",
    "the only difference is that in the former case , we look at rmark.status while in the latter we look at lmark.status .",
    "the reason is that in both cases , we have to consider the status of the rightmost tile .",
    "this allows us to briefly mention that the function leftmost works in a similar way , also based on the computation of the distance between the given path and the constructed one which should be the leftmost one . during the construction",
    ", the algorithm tries to keep the distance between the current tile on the given path and the current tile of the constructed path exactly equal to  1 .",
    "as long as this is possible , the algorithm goes on in this way . if it can hold the condition until the last connection to the target of the path , we are done .",
    "but it may happen , and this indeed does happen , that at the next step after the current path , the distance must be at least  2 .",
    "this means that the constructed path went to much to the left and that it is needed to resume the computation    from a previously reached tile .",
    "if it were needed to go back to the central time each time the computation has to be resumed , the algorithm would be quadratic .",
    "fortunately , a careful analysis of the construction shows that it is possible to find key tiles so that each time we have to resume the computation , we have to go back to the last fixed key tiles so that adding all the traversed parts of the path lead to a total length which is at most twice the length of the given path .",
    "the length of this part of the program exceeds the room for this paper .",
    "however , the overall computation of the function leftmost is still linear in time with respect to the length of the given path .    as a last auxiliary function",
    ", we just remind the algorithm for the poisson generator , taking from  @xcite .",
    "we can rewrite it as follows :      the simulation is controlled by the procedure execute , see algorithm  [ exec ] .",
    "as there are many variables to collect partial results for later analysis , we use records in order to make the program more readable . the partial results concern the various kinds of messages , so that the fields of the records are public , reply , write , nonpublic , erase .",
    "the function init_config initializes the table space . in particular , for each tile , it provides the information about the number of the tile , its sector , as well as the similar information for its seven neighbours .",
    "it also computes the table associates of the numbers of the sides of tile in the neighbour sharing this side .    in algorithm",
    "[ exec ] , note that we perform addition on records thanks to the facility given by @xmath110 to overload the usual signs of operation + , @xmath0 , @xmath111 as well as relations , @xmath12 and @xmath112 as an example .",
    "we develop the function transition in algorithm  [ transit ] .",
    "the actual content of the function transition is performed by the procedure action_in which implements the exact choices of the simulation , see algorithm  [ action ] .    as indicated in section  [ scenario ] ,",
    "public messages are sent and conveyed at odd times . due to the copying process fromstack0 onto stack1 on which the execution is based , the information about a public message has to be copied on stack1 at even times : otherwise , the message would be erased .",
    "this is what the procedure replicate performs .",
    "the same procedure is also used for the erasing messages during the delay they observe at the tile which emitted a public message .",
    "of course , at each replication , the delay is decreased by  1 , until the delay reaches  1 . at this moment",
    ", it is sent to catch the emitted message .",
    "let us describe this procedure with more details .",
    "let @xmath101 be a public message issued at time  @xmath113@xmath01 , with @xmath114 by the procedure send .",
    "at the same time , the procedure send creates an erasing message @xmath102 with the same number as  @xmath101 . in send",
    ", the poisson random generator is called with the parameter poisson_radius in order to define the radius of propagation of  @xmath101 .",
    "this initializes the field wait attached to  @xmath115 . by construction",
    ", the radius is always positive .",
    "note that there is no condition on the time for the management of an erasing message .",
    "as long as its delay is greater than  1 , the erasing message remains in the tile  @xmath38 where it was created .",
    "when the delay is  1 , it is sent to the neighbours with its field wait set to  0 .",
    "the procedure convey transmits the erasing message as its delay is now always  0 , called at each time by action_in , see algorithm  [ action ] .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if  @xmath101 is sent at the time  @xmath82 and @xmath102 is sent at the time  @xmath82+@xmath84 , then @xmath101 and  @xmath102 are at the same tile at the time  @xmath82+@xmath103 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath101 and  @xmath102 are present on the same tile at an even time : @xmath82+@xmath103 has the same parity as @xmath82 which is odd and when @xmath101 is sent , but @xmath102 is sent when @xmath116 . and",
    "so , the coincidence is detected by the procedure convey at the time @xmath82+@xmath103 + 1 : at this time , @xmath101 , which reached the tile  @xmath117 at  @xmath82+@xmath103 is still there at @xmath82+@xmath103 + 1 .",
    "the situation is given in a schematic way by table  [ erasing ] and it is illustrated by figure  [ fig_erasing ] .",
    "in the program , the cancellation of a message reached by its erasing signal is performed by the procedure convey .",
    "when dealing with a public message , the first task of the procedure is to scan the stack in order to possibly detect an erasing signal with the same number as the message .",
    "when this happens , the message , which is scanned in stack0 is simply not copied onto stack1 .",
    "when the procedure examine an erasing signal , it performs a similar scanning : if a public message bears the same number as the signal , the signal is not copied onto stack1 .",
    "as the cancellation has to occur when both signals are present , this simple way is enough to perform this action and there is no need to connect the two decisions of not copying the information onto stack1 .",
    "this is guaranteed by the disjunction between stack0 and stack1 .",
    "the experiment was performed by the running the program on a simple laptop .",
    "the laptop is a lenovo one , with two intel processors , both working at 2  ghz , and linux mandriva as operating system .",
    "the used @xmath110-compiler belongs to the gnu - family , version 4.4.1 . in the first sub - section",
    ", we describe the experiment and we give an account of the results . in the second sub - section ,",
    "we give an interpretation of the results .",
    "the program was run for six value of the depth of the fibonacci tree , ranging from  5 to  10 .",
    "denote by @xmath118 the observation space .",
    "the size of  @xmath118 is defined by the depth of the fibonacci tree which spans the seven sectors displayed around the central cell .",
    "we consider the tiles whose level in the tree is at most depth which takes values in [ 5 .. 10 ] in our experiments .",
    "this means that @xmath118 contains 1625 tiles when @xmath119 and 200593 tiles when @xmath120 .",
    "increasing the depth by  1 means multiplying the number of tiles by a coefficient which quickly tends to @xmath121 .",
    "this factor of a bit more than 2.6 , can be observed in table  [ statnb1 ] which indicates the number of tiles of  @xmath118 for the different values of depth .",
    "the second parameter which we also changed is the radius of propagation of the public messages .",
    "as indicated in section  [ scenario ] , the radius is an integer valued random variable following a poisson law .",
    "the coefficient is fixed to  5 in one series of experiments and to  10 in the second one .",
    "the range of the variable is in mean this coefficient .",
    "however , the value may range from  0 to twice the coefficient with , from time to time , bigger values .",
    "table  [ statnb1 ] indicates the number of messages emitted in the observed area under these conditions .",
    "the remaining parameters are the following .",
    "each tile is given the possibility to emit a message .",
    "again we assume that the probability of such an event is given by a poisson law .",
    "the coefficient is 0,005 for a public message , taking into account that such messages are emitted at odd times only .",
    "also , the tiles which are on the border of the space and which are the more numerous , more than 60% of the overall number of tiles in  @xmath118 , are given an additional possibility with again a poisson law whose coefficient is 0.0025 .",
    "this is also to reflect the possibility for the tiles of  @xmath118 to receive messages from outside  @xmath118 .",
    "now , for private messages , they are caused either as a reply to a public message , or as a single message sent to a particular tile via the consultation of the directory .",
    "these events are also following a poisson law and the coefficient is 0.0025 for the reply to a public message , and 0.001 for the consultation of a directory . in the case of a message sent after consulting the directory ,",
    "it is assumed that the coordinate of the tile given by the directory falls within  @xmath118 and that both numbers constituting the coordinate are uniformly distributed in their respective ranges .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6 # 7    # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6    another important feature regarding private messages is that in the experiment , it was assumed that once a communication has started it goes on endlessly : if @xmath3  replies to a message sent by  @xmath29 , either public or private , then @xmath29  replies to  @xmath3 which again replies to  @xmath29 and this process goes on periodically .",
    "moreover , the reply was always assumed to be immediate .",
    "table  [ statnb1 ] indicates the number of messages issued during the whole time of the simulation , measured by the number of iterations of the procedure execute . the number of iterations is also given by the table .",
    "it can be noticed that this number is always 168 for small values .",
    "this number was fixed for the experiment and it can be noticed that . for a fixed value of the mean radius of propagation ,",
    "we notice that the number of iteration becomes lower and lower .",
    "this is a limitation caused by the system and the machine under which the program was run .",
    "it can be noticed that the decay of the number of the iterations corresponds to the increase of the number of tiles .",
    "accordingly , this alters the number of messages which were issued .",
    "table  [ statnb1 ] indicates the ratio between the numbers of messages sent when the radius of propagation is  5 and when the depth of the fibonacci tree is  5 , 6 and  7 as for these depths , we have the same duration  168 . in table",
    "[ statnb2 ] , we indicate the overall number of sent messages at time  24 as we have data for each depth of the experiment .",
    "this allows us to compute the ratio between numbers associated to consecutive depths .",
    "table  [ statnb1 ] also reports another measurement performed by the program : if @xmath122 is the number of messages emitted up to the time  @xmath82 with @xmath123 $ ] , where @xmath38 is the duration of the experiment , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of iterations , then the lines mean give the mean value of the numbers @xmath124 .",
    "these values are computed when the propagation radius is  5 and when it is  10 .",
    "another interesting information is the maximal number of messages passing through a tile .",
    "the data are given in table  [ statmax1 ] , in the same conditions as in table  [ statnb1 ] .",
    "the data are summarized in tables  [ statmax1 ] and  [ statmax2 ] .",
    "below , tables  [ statcompo1 ] and  [ statcompo2 ] give an information on the decomposition of the number of emitted messages between the public messages and the private ones    # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6    # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5    and , among the latter , between replies to a public message and direct messages to a tile whose coordinates are delivered by the directory .    as for table",
    "[ statnb1 ] , table  [ statcompo1 ] gives the information for each area of  @xmath118 defined by the depth of the fibonacci tree .",
    "the upper half of the table concerns a propagation of the public messages characterized by radius  5 , while , the lower half concerns radius  10 .    in table",
    "[ statcompo2 ] , the data are attached to the same time , defined by 24 iterations . this gives a direct comparison between all the data but it does not concern a long enough time period .",
    "we turn to the next sub - section where we try to extract a general information from these data and from a few other ones we have not the room to give in this paper .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in subsection  [ rawdata ] .",
    "the first one concerns the ratios between the number of messages for consecutive depths of the fibonacci trees .",
    "these ratios are close to the ratio between the area of  @xmath118 for consecutive values of the depth of the spanning tree .",
    "it seems that we may conclude that these experimental data support assumption  [ proparea ] .",
    "[ proparea ] for any @xmath82 , the number of messages issued at the time  @xmath82 in  @xmath118 is proportional to the number of tiles belonging to  @xmath118 .    indeed , the coefficient of the poisson law is a kind of mean of the random variable indicating whether a message is sent or not . according to the homogeneous nature of the space and",
    "as the decision of one tile is independent from that of its neighbours , it can be expected that the observed number of issued messages is proportional to the area .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the following consideration . as the actual radius of propagation of the public messages",
    "is bounded , the contribution of far tiles is ruled out , starting from a certain distance from a tile and this distance can be uniformly bounded for all the tiles .",
    "the values of the radius exceeding say twice the mean of the radius as a random variable which we assumed to follow a poisson law can be considered as an event of very small probability so that an infinite repetition of exceptionally long radiuses can be considered as an event of probability  0 .",
    "the same remark apply if we relax a bit the conditions on the coordinates provided by the directory .",
    "we may assume that the number of the sector is uniformly distributed and that the number of the tile in the tree is an integral random variable following a poisson law with a radius of the same size as that of  @xmath118 . and so , relaxing a bit the condition on the directory as",
    "just suggested does not alter the argument in favor of assumption  [ proparea ] .",
    "no clear statement can be inferred from tables  [ statmax1 ] and  [ statmax2 ] , except the fact that the maximal number of messages passing through  @xmath118 seems to be increasing with the time .",
    "this can also be seen on the experiment for each depth : as the number of iteration increases , the maximal number of messages passing at a tile also increases .",
    "it is also interesting to look at where the maximal number of messages appear .",
    "we have not the room to give the relevant information computed by the program . for each iteration",
    ", the program indicates a tile at which the number of passing messages is maximal .",
    "it also splits the information in looking at where is obtained the maximal number of passing public messages or private messages replying to a public message or private messages written to a single tile .",
    "it is interesting to notice that most often the tiles are not the same for the different kinds of messages .",
    "also , the position of this maximum is generally the central tile or one of its neighbours .",
    "however , for the emission of the pubic message , the maximal number of passages at a tile may be obtained a bit further from the central tile , while the replies to these messages seem to be maximal most often at the central tile or its immediate neighbours .",
    "tables  [ statcompo1 ] and  [ statcompo2 ] show a very interesting difference between the cases when the radius of propagation of the public messages is  5 and when it is  10 . in both tables",
    ", we can see that the proportion of public messages is higher when the radius is  5 .",
    "this is particularly striking in table  [ statcompo1 ] , but it is already noticeable in table  [ statcompo2 ] showing that this difference appears quickly and that it tends to increase a bit with the time . it is also interesting to see that the relative loss of the public messages benefit to their replies .",
    "indeed , in both tables , the proportion of direct messages to a single tile is not improved when the depth of the fibonacci tree is increasing .",
    "of course , the poisson coefficient for triggering a public message is 0.005 , while that of a reply is 0.0025 and that of a direct private message is 0.001 .",
    "however , the public messages are triggered at odd times only and the replies occur only at even time while the direct private messages can be sent at any time .",
    "there should be no big difference between direct private messages and replies to a public message .",
    "in fact the explanation lies in the geometry of the space .",
    "indeed , the reply is proposed to any tile visited by the propagation wave which covers all the tiles within the radius fixed at the time when the public message was emitted .",
    "this additional solicitation explains the importance of the replies .    at this point , we can also indicate why we have chosen a poisson law to model this message system .",
    "the reason is that we have to take into account the geometry of the space .",
    "a uniform distribution would give much more weight to distant tiles by the simple fact that their number increases exponentially : the farther they are the more message they would send to the centre .",
    "this is also the reason why we decided to limit the propagation of the public messages .",
    "if no limitation would be put , the number of messages received at any point would grow exponentially with time by the just mentioned argument .",
    "accordingly , the limitation restricts this possibility .",
    "now , the poisson law also gives the possibility to obtain big values with respect to the mean value .",
    "simply these extremal are very rare , the more rare they are higher values .",
    "it is the place here to discuss how these results can be interpreted in a more qualitative way .",
    "the number of iterations suggests that the unit of time is an hour .",
    "the tiles can be interpreted either as individuals or as groups of individuals in a given constant area , the one defined by the area of a tile .",
    "remember that in the space we consider , all tiles have the same area .",
    "the limitation of the public messages can be interpreted as a natural limit due to the conditions in which the message is sent and also depending on the intentions of the sender .",
    "two important points should be noted .",
    "the first one is the property of the public messages to cover all the tiles of a given area for each tile to receive the message once exactly .",
    "the second point is the mechanism to limit the propagation of a public message .",
    "this mechanism needs no centralization .",
    "it is monitored by the sender and , a priori , each tile can be a sender . to be a sender",
    "is defined by a probability which is the same for every tile .",
    "the third point is that in some sense , the indicated scenario is a worse case one with respect to the traffic load supported by each tile .",
    "indeed , the fact that once a communication is established between two tiles goes on endlessly contributes to increase the traffic with the time .",
    "there is room here to tune the modeling by introducing various ways to delay answers or to limit the number of contacts of a tile with others : here also we could consider that this number is a poisson random variable whose mean can be fixed uniformly or depending on other criteria which we have not considered here .",
    "a last point is the possible improvement of the program in order to obtain more data and to go further in the exploration of the simulation space .",
    "note that the file which records all the communications when the depth is  5 and the radius of propagation is  10 and the number of iterations is  168 has a size of around 164 megabytes . as mentioned in section  [ experiment ] , increasing the depth by  1 multiplies the area by around 2.618 .",
    "accordingly , the depth which defines the area of  @xmath118 can not be extent very much .",
    "already depth  10 with radius  10 requires a machine more powerful than a simple laptop .",
    "we are convinced that there is further work ahead to better analyze the data already obtained , to improve the program in order to go further in the exploration of the simulation space .",
    "there is also room to tune the basic parameters in order to get a picture closer to real networks as , for instance , social networks ."
