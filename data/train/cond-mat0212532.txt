    "the bending term is given by @xmath30 where@xmath31 here we have introduced a length scale , @xmath32 which is much longer than the layer period @xmath14 . this bending term becomes important also in certain liquid crystals @xcite .",

    "an important difference from the conventional isotropic elastic theory is that , in an anisotropic system such as nacre , there exist two distinct length scales @xmath34 and @xmath35 . on the contrary , in isotropic systems at equilibrium",
    "when the elastic body is deformed over a range of @xmath36 in the @xmath24-direction , the deformation relaxes out at the same distance @xmath36 also in the @xmath26-direction ; this is because the deformation field of an isotropic system satisfies an elliptic differential equation with a unique length scale ( under the plain strain condition ) . in other words , the deformation in nacre",

    "note here that , in the context of a fracture problem , @xmath34 corresponds to a length of parallel fracture while @xmath35 to that of perpendicular fracture ( see fig . [ f2 ] below ) .",
