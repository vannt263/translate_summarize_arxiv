    "we have determined the average characteristics of the planetary crns and of the astrochemical umist network .",

    "this observation discards a simple explanation for earth s scaling based on a high chemical diversity .",
    "another property that seems to be common to many complex networks is modularity @xcite .",
    "several methods provide valuable insight on the existence of such community structures @xcite .",
    "one of them is _ hierarchical clustering _ , based on identifying similarities between nodes through the topological overlap matrix .",
    "the topological overlap of a pair of nodes @xmath8 is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the number of nodes to which both @xmath11 and @xmath35 nodes are connected .",
    "the denominator gives the smallest degree of the pair of nodes @xmath8 .",
    "hierarchical clustering uses the previous matrix to identify modules based on the assumption that the larger the overlap between two nodes , the higher the probability that they belong to the same module .",
    "the algorithm repeatedly finds the highest topological overlap , grouping together the corresponding two nodes into a new aggregated node and performing a weighted average of the corresponding row and column in the overlap matrix @xcite , and computes the new matrix .",
    "the procedure is applied until the matrix collapses into a single value , having as final result an alternative representation of the network as a tree or dendrogram .",
    "the result of the application of this method to the earth s atmosphere crn is shown in fig .",
    "[ earthmoduls]a , revealing certain communities of nodes characterized by higher topological overlap ( dark regions ) .",
    "in particular , we have noticed that the main modules  the two black squares in panel ( a )  include predominantly the reactants , in one module , and the products , in the other module , involved in reactions with @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) and having as one of the products @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) . the community structure is a consequence of the action of the most reactive free radicals of the earth s atmosphere , cl and oh , capable of reacting with almost all other elements due to their unpaired electron . together with the rest of the atmospheric radicals , such as no , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , clo",
    ", they constitute the source of oxidizing power of the atmosphere , determining the lifetime and the abundance of trace species and acting as atmospheric regulators . among all these oxidizing agents ,",
    "the hydroxyl radical is by far the primary atmospheric oxidant , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in spite of being the most abundant oxidants , are relatively unreactive . as a network measure of reactiveness , the node s out - degree recovers the reactiveness hierarchy of the oxidizing agents ( decreasing out - degree ) : oh , cl , @xmath40 , o , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , no , @xmath44 and clo .",
    "the earth s oxidizing atmosphere characterized by a great chemical disequilibrium , with both oxidizing and reducing gases in a highly reactive mixture , is the unique imprint of the terrestrial atmosphere compared to the planets of the solar system , and these characteristics are recovered also through the analysis of its crn .",
    "we have also analyzed the measure of betweenness centrality ( bc ) @xcite which counts the fraction of shortest paths going through a given edge .",
    "the edge of highest bc is likely to bridge community structures and thus by calculating and subsequently removing this edge through an iterative algorithm , one obtains a reasonably accurate unfolding of the modular structure of the graph @xcite .",
    "the removal process transforms the graph into a binary tree similar to the dendrogram from fig .",
    "[ earthmoduls]a , but formed of bifurcation nodes representing modules and its branches , connected to submodules or individual nodes of the original graph . for the purpose of extracting the hierarchical modularization we use the horton - strahler ( hs ) @xcite . from the bottom to the top of the tree , the hs index changes only when it joins a community of a similar index : the individual nodes ( hs=1 ) join to form a group ( with hs=2 ) , which in turn join other groups to form a second level ( hs=3 ) and so on .",
    "thus , the communities of equal hs indexes form the same modularization level . in fig .",
    "[ earthmoduls]b we include the associated hierarchical level - tree as it results from grouping together communities of equal hs index .",
    "the white circles represent the nodes of the crn graph , while the black ones represent the modules to which they belong .",
    "the most relevant modules are clearly revealed in this figure .",
    "the two fans in the upper part of the figure include the products ( r.h.s .",
    "fan ) and the reactants , respectively ( l.h.s fan ) from reactions with @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) , as discussed above .",
    "we draw the attention also on the module visible in the lower left part of the figure .",
    "it consists mainly of the highly connected core of the reactants participating in termolecular ( type a + b @xmath45 ab ) and photochemical reactions ( a + hv @xmath46 b + c ) .",
    "it includes also the majority of the oxidant agents , some of them being depicted in fig .",
    "[ earthmoduls]b .",
    "the neighboring module includes mainly the products of significant degree resulting from reactions .",
    "within cellular networks , metabolic pathways are one of the most relevant components of life @xcite .",
    "such networks are defined at the microscopic , cell - level scale , whereas those considered in our study deal with vast spatial scales . moreover",
    ", cellular networks result from biological evolution , whereas the crns studied here are generated from mechanisms that seem to strongly depart from this scenario , although natural selection seems to be a key mechanism for the evolution of earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "other crn s have single - scaled or broad - scale structure .",
    "earth s atmosphere is a clear exception to this rule .",
    "our analysis shows that , together with a broad degree distribution , the crn of our planet is also rich in correlations .",
    "this is particularly remarkable in terms of the presence of a well - defined hierarchical organization , as shown by its modular , nested architecture .",
    "what is the origin of such difference ?",
    "one clear candidate is the strong , nonlinear coupling between atmosphere and biosphere .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the atmosphere is the face of a planet and it tells if it is alive or dead .",
    "its chemical composition and its departure from a near - equilibrium state are consistent with the presence of life .",
    "our analysis gives strength to this conjecture , since the topological organization of earth s atmosphere displays the hierarchical patterns observed in other living structures . in this context , it is generally accepted @xcite that our planet is able to self - regulate its climate and keep a chemically unstable atmosphere constant and appropriate for life . over the last 2500 myr ]",
    "it does so by using the incoming energy ( light ) to recycle the available chemicals through both positive and negative feedbacks .",
    "well - defined cycles can be identified and regulation works over a wide range of conditions .",
    "these are all characteristics of a metabolism @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and composition of the atmosphere of a given planet is a consequence of both dynamical and historical constraints .",
    "physical factors strongly influence the final pattern at the global scale .",
    "but not less important seems the role played by historical contingencies and histeretic processes , which can irreversibly modify a planet s climate .",
    "earth , venus and mars all had water soon after their formation 4.5 billion years ago .",
    "venus experienced a global runaway greenhouse effect about 3 billion to 4 billion years ago .",
    "mars followed a different path towards a runaway cooling .",
    "the common pattern of organization of both mars and venus crn confirms that lack of biosphere leads to a simple , equilibrium set of reactions with a well - defined , single - scale topology .",
    "instead , the presence of a mechanism injecting reactive components into the reaction pool might eventually generate a complex network not unlike the ones seen in living structures at the small scale .",
    "future work should explore the use of kinetic models to test this conjecture .",
