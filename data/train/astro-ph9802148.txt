    "shortly after their initial identification in 1963 by schmidt it became clear that less than 10% of quasars are strong sources of radio emission .",
    "the gap in the quasar radio luminosity function is extremely pronounced , with only a handful of objects occupying the region between quasars which are radio - loud and those which are radio - quiet ( kellermann et al .",
    "1989 ; miller , peacock & mead 1990 ; miller , rawlings & saunders 1993 , henceforth mrs93 ) , and it is now widely accepted that there are two distinct populations of quasar .",
    "however , from @xmath5 m through to soft x - ray wavelengths the properties of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( rlqs and rqqs respectively ) are generally very similar , to the extent that to first order an rlq spectrum can be considered to be the spectrum of an rqq with the addition of a strong power - law component in the radio .",
    "the presence or absence of this radio component must be a fundamental indicator of the processes occurring in the quasar , but there is still no consensus as to exactly what it signifies .",
    "studies of less luminous , nearby active galaxies have shown that the radio - loud objects ( _ ie _ radio galaxies ) are invariably elliptical systems whereas the radio - quiets ( seyferts ) tend to be spirals , suggesting that some property of gas - rich disc galaxies inhibits the formation of large , powerful radio sources ( see osterbrock 1991 ) .",
    "two factors have encouraged the extension of this result to the higher redshifts and larger nuclear luminosities typical of quasars : the success of unified schemes which link radio galaxies and rlqs via beaming effects and viewing angle ( see urry & padovani 1995 ) and the established fact that seyfert 1 nuclei and rqqs form a continuous sequence in terms of their optical luminosities and have identical emission line characteristics ( see osterbrock 1991 , antonucci 1993 ) .    however , recent advances in ground- and space - based observing have allowed the host galaxies of nearby quasars to be imaged and _ reliably _ classified for the first time .",
    "the results have shown that _ not all _ rqqs lie in disc systems but that as many as 50% might be found in elliptical hosts ( _ eg _ taylor et al .",
    "1996 , disney et al .",
    "1995 , lacy , rawlings & hill 1992 , vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 ) . indeed , there is some evidence that elliptical galaxies might account for all of the most optically luminous rqqs ( taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) . clearly the simple ` radio - loud @xmath6 elliptical , radio - quiet @xmath6 disc ' picture can no longer be supported , and it has become more important than ever to determine in what respects radio - quiet quasars are different from their radio - loud counterparts .",
    "unfortunately , the most obvious wavelength regime in which they differ - the radio - is also the regime in which least is known about the properties of rqqs .",
    "most radio surveys of optically - selected quasar samples have lacked the sensitivity to detect the radio - quiet objects , and the few high - sensitivity surveys have tended to give only fluxes at a single frequency , with only limited information on radio structure and spectral index .    like seyferts ,",
    "rqqs are not radio silent and with sensitivities at the millijansky level modern multi - element synthesis telescopes can easily detect the radio emission from many of the nearer ( @xmath7 ) objects . in this paper we present the results of a multi - frequency , high - resolution radio survey of low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) , low - luminosity ( m@xmath9 ) rqqs using the very large array ( vla ) in its high - resolution a - configuration .",
    "the aim of this work was to search for compact , non - thermal radio sources associated with the quasars , to determine their properties and to compare them with those of radio - loud objects .    as well as our own observations , we also make use of data from the literature .",
    "our rqq sample comprises 27 objects , 19 of which have already been observed with a - array at 4.8  ghz by kellermann et al .",
    "( 1989 ) as part of their radio study of the bright quasar survey ( bqs ; schmidt & green 1983 , green , schmidt & liebert 1986 ) .",
    "we have observed all 27 rqqs at 1.4  ghz and completed the coverage of the sample at 4.8  ghz with observations of the 8 non - bqs quasars .",
    "in addition we obtained 8.4-ghz maps for 21 objects .",
    "seventeen of the rqqs in our sample were also included in a major investigation into quasar host galaxies ( dunlop et al .",
    "1993 , taylor et al .",
    "we use these objects to investigate the relationship between the host and the ` radio loudness ' of the quasar and refer to them as our ` host galaxy subsample ' .",
    "two objects ( pg  0007@xmath10106 & 1635@xmath10119 ) have unusually large radio luminosities and arguably are not true _",
    "radio - quiet _ quasars but belong to a separate class of their own .",
    "we use the term ` radio - intermediate quasar ' ( riq ) to describe these .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "data acquisition and reduction are discussed in section 2 , followed by a description of the resulting radio images in section 3 .",
    "section 4 of the paper summarises the debate over the origin of non - thermal radio emission in rqqs and section 5 explores the implications of the current observations , and compares the rqq emission with the radio properties of other types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in section 6",
    "we examine the relationship between the radio properties of the 17 rqqs in our host galaxy subsample and the properties of the hosts themselves , and our conclusions are summarised in section 7 .",
    "we assume @xmath11  kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 throughout .",
    "in order to build up a picture of rqq radio emission over a range of frequencies , snapshot observations were made with the vla in a - configuration at 1.4 , 4.8 and 8.4  ghz ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands respectively ) .",
    "many of the objects in our sample have already been observed at one or more of these frequencies as part of previous surveys and we make use of these data in the current study .    all of the palomar - green ( pg ) objects were observed at 4.8  ghz with the vla in both d- and a - configurations as part of the bqs ( november 1983 , kellermann _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; june 1991 , mrs93 ) .",

    "we also include additional data at 1.4  ghz for three quasars ( pg  0007 + 106 , pg  0026 + 129 & pg  0052 + 251 ) .",
    "these maps have been presented previously in philip miller s phd thesis ( miller 1992 ) , and we publish them here with his permission .",
    "the observations were made in august 1991 .",
    "our own 1.4- and 8.4-ghz observations were made with a - configuration in december 1992 and july 1995 .",

    "table  1 lists the observing dates for all 27 objects at each frequency to allow an assessment of the potential impact of any source variability on the individual flux measurements .",
    "data reduction followed the usual procedure within aips .",
    "two 50-mhz if channels were used and the flux densities were calibrated relative to 3c48 , to give an estimated flux uncertainty of 5% in the final maps .",
    "a natural weighting scheme was used for the fourier transform , giving noise levels in the final maps of @xmath17 300 , 80 and 60 @xmath18jy  beam@xmath12 at 1.4 , 4.8 and 8.4  ghz respectively and synthesized beamwidths of 1.4 , 0.4 and 0.24@xmath19 ( fwhm ) .",

    "additional 1.4  ghz observations of these sources were made in 12/92 . [ cols=\">,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have determined the nir ( @xmath22-band : 2.2@xmath18 m ) luminosities , scalelengths and morphological types for the host galaxies surrounding 17 of the rqqs in the current sample ( table  7 ) .",
    "they found that , whilst @xmath23 of the rqqs were found in disc systems , for a significant fraction of objects the best fitting model was in fact an _ elliptical _ galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the results of several other studies which also find rqqs to be distributed amongst a mixture of disc - like and spheroidal hosts ( eg .",
    "vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 , disney et al . 1995 )",
    ". however , taylor et al . also found a tendency for the quasars in disc hosts to be less luminous than those in ellipticals .",
    "although the sample was too small for the result to be statistically significant , the trend is supported by the results of mcleod & rieke ( 1994 ) , who determined the nir morphologies of galaxies containing low - luminosity rqqs close to the rqq / seyfert boundary and found that essentially all of these objects lie in disc systems .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "speculate that for @xmath24 all rqqs might occur in elliptical galaxies rather than discs .",
    "the agn traditionally associated with elliptical hosts ( _ ie _ radio galaxies and rlqs ) produce large , powerful radio sources and this suggests that the rqqs in elliptical galaxies , whilst technically ` radio quiet ' , might still harbour radio sources which differ in size and luminosity from those in disc galaxies .    within our sample of 17 rqqs ,",
    "8 objects have hosts in which the dominant stellar component is disc - like , 6 lie in spheroidal systems and 3 have ambiguous morphologies .",
    "we find _ no _ statistically significant differences between the radio sources in different types of host galaxy .",
    "the size distributions of the radio sources ( including upper limits ) are indistinguishable for elliptical and disc hosts .",
    "the rqqs in elliptical hosts _ do not _ contain more luminous radio sources than those in disc galaxies , although this may not be true for values of @xmath25 if all optically luminous rrqs are found in ellipticals _ and _ the radio - optical correlation is real .",
    "radio spectral indices are generally steep in both types of host , and it appears that radio - intermediate quasars can occur in either . if the interpretation of these objects as beamed sources is correct then we can infer that having an elliptical galaxy as a host is not a prerequisite for the formation of a relativistic jet .",
    "one interesting ( though not formally significant ) point is that , of the 5 objects in table  7 in which radio structure has been _ resolved _ , 4 are in elliptical systems ( the fourth is an riq and therefore may not be representative of the radio - quiet population ) .",
    "this is the only indication that rqqs in elliptical galaxies might have different radio properties from those in discs .",
    "the current sample is small , and is limited to rqqs of relatively low optical luminosity , but our radio survey clearly demonstrates that having an elliptical host does not automatically confer a large radio luminosity on the quasar .",
    "a significant number of elliptical galaxies with active nuclei do _ not _ produce large , powerful radio sources .",
    "instead they contain small , weak sources very similar to those in disc systems .",
    "more detailed studies of the host galaxies , such as our own @xmath26-band hst imaging programme , should allow us to determine if and how these elliptical rqq hosts differ from the elliptical systems containing radio - loud agn .      in two of the rqqs with resolved radio morphologies",
    "we also see evidence for structure in the host galaxies along similar position angles , and thus possibly related to the radio emission .    in pg",
    "0157@xmath10001 the two radio ` lobes ' straddle the optical nucleus in the same pa as an emission - line structure visible in the [ oiii ] image by stockton & mackenty ( 1987 ) .",
    "the scale of the [ oiii ] emission is @xmath27 ( 37  kpc ) - much larger than the @xmath28 ( 7  kpc ) separation of the radio lobes , so the two features are unlikely to be directly associated .",
    "however , the morphology is consistent with standard models of anisotropy in agn in which radio jets are ejected along the axis of a cone of radiation from the central engine which can ionise gas clouds further out in the body of the host galaxy .",
    "the triple radio source in pg  2130 + 099 is perpendicular to the major axis of the host ( as determined by taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) but is aligned with an anomalously blue region of the galaxy nucleus ( hutchings & neff 1992 ) . once again , this is consistent with the standard model for agn , in which quasar light is emitted preferentially in the direction of the radio jet but is scattered back into the line of sight by material in the host galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the blue excess may be due to a burst of massive starformation triggered by the radio jet as it passes through the host . at 8.4  ghz",
    "we find marginal evidence for extended emission across the quasar nucleus in a direction orthogonal to that of the triple source - _ ie _ parallel to the major axis of the host galaxy ( figure  2 ) .",
    "this is similar to radio structure in the seyfert nucleus of ngc  5929 ( su et al .",
    "detection of a high - frequency excess in pg  2130 + 099 at 15  ghz ( antonucci & barvainis 1988 ) lends support to the theory that the orthogonal structure might consist of thermal emission from a circumnuclear starburst lying in the plane of the host galaxy . the emission would have to have a low @xmath29 ( @xmath30  k ) , but this should be testable with more sensitive observations at 8.4 & 15  ghz .",
    "we have measured the radio fluxes and spectral indices of a sample of 27 rqqs using the vla in a - configuration .",
    "the angular resolution of the vla is not sufficient to unambiguously determine the origin of the radio emission in these objects , but from the data we are able to conclude the following :    * ( 1 ) * in 74% of the sample we detect a radio source which is coincident with the optical quasar to within the positional uncertainty of the optical measurements .    *",
    "( 2 ) * the spectral indices of the rqqs are generally steep ( @xmath31 , where @xmath3 ) , although two objects , which also exhibit variability and unusually large radio luminosities , have flat radio spectra .    *",
    "( 3 ) * lower limits on the brightness temperatures of many of the radio sources place them at the upper end of the range expected for emission related to stellar processes ( @xmath32  k ) ( _ ie _ in the regime in which we would expect to see some spectral flattening if the emission was indeed stellar in origin ) . in some objects the brightness temperature is almost certainly many orders of magnitude greater than this , in which case the radio emission _",
    "can not _ be produced by a starburst .",
    "large numbers of supernovae occurring within a very small volume would be required in order to reproduce the observed radio luminosities .",
    "future observations with greater angular resolution will place more rigorous constraints on all these parameters .    *",
    "( 4 ) * in nine ( possibly ten ) objects we are able to resolve radio structure , which takes the form of double , triple and linear sources on scales of a few kiloparsecs .",
    "these structures are consistent with the 100-pc - scale radio jets observed in low - redshift seyfert nuclei , and constitute strong evidence that collimated ejection of radio plasma from the central engine is occurring in rqqs .    *",
    "( 5 ) * the distribution of radio luminosities in rqqs form a natural extension to those of seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "there appears to be a correlation between radio luminosity and the optical absolute magnitude of the quasar , suggesting a close relationship between the central engine and the mechanism responsible for the bulk of the radio emission .    *",
    "( 6 ) * there are no statistically significant differences in the present data between the radio properties of the rqqs in disc - dominated galaxies and those in elliptical hosts .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the conclusions of other recent radio studies of rqqs : that in at least some rqqs a significant contribution to the overall radio emission comes from a compact nuclear source which is directly associated with the central engine of the quasar , and which is qualitatively similar to the more powerful radio sources observed in rlqs .",
