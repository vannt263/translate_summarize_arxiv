    "<S> large amounts of data , of very different kinds , have been accumulated along decades . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , a fresh look at these compilations , on the basis of simple -physically meaningful- models , leads to a qualitative understanding of the data .    in previous papers @xcite , on the basis of the scaling characteristic of thomas - fermi theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that both the nist data on ionization potentials of atomic ions@xmath2@xcite , and the correlation energies of atomic ions can be accomodated along single universal curves .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we go a step further and develop a simple model allowing the identification of problematic isolated reported values for the ionization potentials in a particular isoelectronic sequence . because of the fact that the compilation is very often used for different purposes , indications of which data could be wrong and should be re - examined is of great importance . for instance , as commented in refs . [ ] and [ ] , accurate description of the spectra is useful in order to model some dynamical features of stellar sources , and also to interpret astronomical data .    our model for the ionization potential is a smooth interpolation that matches both the large-@xmath0 ( heavy ion ) and the @xmath1 ( anion ) regions.@xcite we call it the `` regularized perturbation theory '' ( rpt ) . we have used similar approaches in order to compute the energy of relatively large quantum dots,@xcite atomic ions in a harmonic trap,@xcite neutral atoms in traps,@xcite and rydberg - like impurity levels in a quantum well.@xcite    the rpt series for the ionization potential of an @xmath3-electron atomic ion with nuclear charge @xmath0 is written as ( atomic units are used everywhere):@xcite    @xmath4    coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are obtained from the large-@xmath0 limit.@xcite @xmath5 comes from the leading term ( free electrons in the nuclear field ) , whereas @xmath6 is computed in the next - to - leading approximation , where coulomb repulsion between electrons is perturbatively treated . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic corrections should be included because the nist data span the range of nuclear charges up to very heavy ions , i.e. @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> detailed expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with explicit relativistic corrections , can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the next two terms of the series have the functional form suggested by higher - order perturbation theory on the coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to determine them , we shall follow a different strategy . </S>",
    "<S> we force expression ( [ ip ] ) to match the expected value and the slope at @xmath8.@xcite in this sense , it is a `` regularized perturbative series '' . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are written as follows :    @xmath9    @xmath10 is the electron affinity of the neutral atom with @xmath11 electrons.@xcite the slope @xmath12 , on the other hand , is computed in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath13 , the latter is a characteristic radius of the @xmath14-electron system , which we estimate as the covalent radius.@xcite note that @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of the slope makes use of the fact that , at @xmath8 , the outer electron interacts with a neutral core . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction is short - ranged and the wave function at large distances is solely determined by the binding energy , i.e. @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this function in order to perturbatively compute the residual coulomb interaction of the outer electron with the core , when @xmath0 is slightly displaced from @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expression for @xmath12 was derived earlier in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] .    once the coefficients in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ip ] ) are determined , our rpt series provides an interpolation for intermediate values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig10 ] , in quality of example , the series for ne - like ions ( @xmath16 ) along with the corresponding nist data .    </S>",
    "<S> some comments should be added to this figure . </S>",
    "<S> first , nist reported values are experimental points only when @xmath0 is very close to @xmath3 . for larger @xmath0 , data come from calculations or interpolations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect relatively high errors in this regime . relative deviations of the rpt from nist data are only a few percents in the intermediate-@xmath0 region , which is a common feature of interpolants.@xcite    second , the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath0 is smooth . in the upper panel , it is difficult to distinguish a problematic point , even if we change the scale . an abrupt change in @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> could only be related to a rearrange of the occupied electronic levels . </S>",
    "<S> this may take place at specific values of @xmath0 , also reported in the nist compilation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in spite of the fact that our rpt series lacks of spectroscopic precision , every jump or deviation in nist - rpt , not coinciding with a spectrum rearrangement point , can be taken as a signature of possible errors . </S>",
    "<S> problematic points are identified by comparison with a smoothed curve , which we construct by means of a 5-points running average .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ne - like ions ( @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> upper panel : ionization potentials taken from the nist compilation along with our nonrelativistic ( discontinuous , blue ) and relativistically corrected ( continuous , red ) rpt predictions versus atomic number . </S>",
    "<S> curves are smooth at any scale . </S>",
    "<S> lower panel : the difference between nist reported values and the relativistic rpt series versus atomic number . reported error bars are shown . </S>",
    "<S> inconsistencies at @xmath18 , 22 , 27 , 74 , and the abrupt jump at @xmath19 are noticed . a 5-points running average curve ( blue line ) </S>",
    "<S> is used to identify problematic points , as shown in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> we point out also a great dispersion of the data for @xmath20 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable deviations at @xmath21,@xcite and the abrupt jump at @xmath22,@xcite just to mention a few examples common to many of the isoelectronic sequences , are clear indications of deficiencies in the computed data reported by nist . the dispersion of the data for very heavy ions should also motivate a reconsideration of the dirac - fock calculations.@xcite    in the appendices , we examine @xmath23 isoelectronic sequences ( five rows of the mendeleev table ) , from he - like to xe - like ions . in this range , </S>",
    "<S> only the sequences which do not have a stable singly charged anion are excluded . </S>",
    "<S> heavier ions , from la - like to ac - like , are to be analyzed in a subsequent paper @xcite .    we hope that the present analysis will be helpful in order to improve the reference data .    </S>",
