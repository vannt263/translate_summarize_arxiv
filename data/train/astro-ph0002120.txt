    "the determination of the pregalactic , or primordial , helium abundance by mass @xmath1 is paramount for the study of cosmology , the physics of elementary particles , and the chemical evolution of galaxies ( e. g. fields & olive 1998 , izotov et al .",
    "1999 , peimbert & torres - peimbert 1999 , and references therein ) . in this review",
    "we briefly discuss the method used to derive @xmath1 and its main sources of error as well as a new determination based on observations of the smc .",
    "this determination is compared with those carried out earlier based on extremely metal poor extragalactic h  ii regions .",
    "the magellanic clouds determination of @xmath1 can have at least four significant advantages and one disadvantage with respect to those based on distant h  ii region complexes : a ) no underlying absorption correction for the helium lines is needed because the ionizing stars can be excluded from the observing slit , b ) the determination of the helium ionization correction factor can be estimated by observing different lines of sight of a given h  ii region , c ) the accuracy of the determination can be estimated by comparing the results derived from different points in a given h  ii region , d ) the electron temperature is generally smaller than those of metal poorer h  ii regions reducing the effect of collisional excitation from the metastable 2@xmath2 s level of he  i , and e ) the disadvantage is that the correction due to the chemical evolution of the smc is in general larger than for the other systems .",
    "to derive accurate he@xmath3/h@xmath3 values we need very accurate @xmath4 ( he  ii ) , @xmath5 ( he  ii ) , and @xmath6(3889 , he  i ) values .",
    "good approximations to determine he@xmath3/h@xmath3 for @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9  k  @xmath10  k and @xmath11 , have been presented for the main helium lines by benjamin , skillman and smits ( 1999 ) :    @xmath12    fortunately for giant extragalacic h  ii regions @xmath13 is very small and frequently close to zero .",
    "@xmath13 can be estimated together with @xmath4 ( he  ii ) from the 3889/4471 and the 7065/4471 ratios computed by robbins ( 1968 ) .",
    "most authors assume that @xmath5(o  iii ) = @xmath5(he  ii ) , there are two reasons for this assumption the he@xmath3 and o@xmath14 emission regions occupy similar volumes ( but not identical ones ) and @xmath5(o  iii ) is easy to measure .",
    "nevertheless the assumption is correct only for isothermal nebulae , and not for real nebulae if very accurate abundances are needed . in the presence of temperature variations along the line of sight the [ o  iii ]",
    "lines originate preferentially in the high temperature zones and the helium and hydrogen lines in the low temperature zones ( e.g. peimbert 1967 , 1995 ) .",
    "it can be shown that the temperature derived from the ratio of the balmer continuum to a balmer emission line , @xmath5(bac ) , is similar to @xmath5(he  ii ) , and that both temperatures are smaller than @xmath5(o  iii ) .    from models computed with cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) it",
    "is found that @xmath5(bac ) labeled @xmath5(hth ) by cloudy is about 5% smaller than @xmath5(o  iii ) .",
    "moreover in the model with a homogeneous sphere of i  zw  18 by stasinska and schaerer ( 1999 ) it is found that @xmath15  k ( for 63% of the volume ) and @xmath16  k ( for 36% of the volume ) indicating the presence of temperature variations .",
    "notice that the average temperature has to be weighted by the emissivities strengthening the effect of the temperature variations .",
    "moreover there is additional evidence that indicates that the temperature variations are even higher than those predicted by photoionization models ( e. g. peimbert 1995 ; luridiana , peimbert , & leitherer 1999 ; stasinska and schaerer 1999 ) . from equations",
    "( 13 ) it follows that the smaller the adopted temperature the smaller the derived he@xmath3/h@xmath3 value .    due to the presence of very strong density variations inside gaseous nebulae the different methods to derive the density yield very different values . the root mean square density , @xmath4(rms ) ,",
    "is usually obtained from the observed flux in a balmer line and by assuming a spherical geometry ; @xmath4(rms ) provides a minimum value for @xmath4(he  ii ) , the local density needed to derive the helium abundance .",
    "forbidden line ratios of lines of similar excitation energy give us an average density for cases where the density is similar or smaller than the critical density for collisional deexcitation ; available line ratios in the visual region are those of [ s  ii ] , [ o  ii ] , [ cl  iii ] , and [ ar  iv ] , unfortunately giant extragalactic h  ii regions are close to the low density limit of these ratios , the line intensities of [ cl  iii ] are very faint , for most observations of the [ o  ii ] lines the resolution is not high enough to separate @xmath173726 from @xmath173729 nor @xmath174711 of [ ar  iv ] from @xmath174713 of he  i. consequently most of the densities in the literature are those derived from the [ s  ii ] lines , but as rightly mentioned by izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky ( 1994 , 1997 ) they are not representative of the regions where the he  i lines originate .",
    "the self - consistent method , advocated by izotov and collaborators , is based only on line ratios of helium i and is the best method to derive the density of the he  ii zone : @xmath4(he  ii ) .",
    "the stellar underlying absorption can affect the derived he  i and h  i emission line intensities and has to be taken into account .",
    "the best way to reduce this effect is to avoid the presence of bright early type stars in the observed slit , this can only be done for objects inside the galaxy and the magellanic clouds . to minimize the effect of the underlying absorption it is recommended to use only objects where the line intensities show very large equivalent widths in emission , and to increase the spectral resolution .",
    "the best way to correct for underlying absorption is to use starburst models that predict the underlying stellar spectrum .",
    "the correction for underlying absorption can be tested by comparing the higher order balmer lines , that are most affected by this effect , with the brightest balmer lines that are the least affected .",
    "similarly the underlying absorption effect is larger for @xmath174471 and smaller for @xmath185876 , 6678 and 7065 ; the effect for these three lines is in general negligible due to a combination of causes ( mainly their large equivalent widths in emission ) .",
    "the total he / h value is given by :    @xmath19    the he@xmath14/h@xmath3 ratio can be obtained directly from the 4686/h@xmath20 intensity ratio . in objects of low degree of ionization",
    "the presence of neutral helium inside the h  ii region is important and @xmath21(he ) becomes larger than 1 .",
    "the @xmath21(he ) can be estimated by observing a given nebula at different lines of sight since he@xmath22 is expected to be located in the outer regions .",
    "another way to deal with this problem is to observe h  ii regions of high degree of ionization where the he@xmath22 amount is expected to be negligible .",
    "vlchez & pagel ( 1988 ) ( see also pagel et al .",
    "1992 ) defined a radiation softness parameter given by    @xmath23    for large values of @xmath24 the amount of neutral helium is significant , while for low values of @xmath24 it is negligible .",
    "on the other hand for ionization bounded objects of very high degree of ionization the amount of h@xmath22 inside the he@xmath3 strmgren sphere becomes significant and the @xmath21(he ) can become smaller than 1 . this possibility was firstly mentioned by shields ( 1974 ) and studied extensively by armour et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for constant density models .",
    "since h@xmath22 will be located in a thin shell in the border of the nebula it can be shown that for ionization bounded nebulae of homogeneous density the fraction of h@xmath22/he@xmath3 will be three times larger for an observation of the whole object than for an observation of a line of sight that includes the center .",
    "similarly this fraction becomes higher than a factor of three for models with decreasing density from the center outwards .",
    "alternatively for density bounded nebulae this effect can be neglected .",
    "peimbert , peimbert , & ruiz ( 2000a ) presented long slit observations of the most luminous h  ii region in the smc : ngc  346 .",
    "they divided the two long slit positions into thirteen areas , four including the brightest stars ( @xmath25 ) and 9 without stars brighter than @xmath26 . in the upper part of figure 1",
    "we present a spectrum that includes all the observed areas ( region 346b ) ; while in the lower part of figure 1 we present a spectrum made by the seven brightest areas that do not include the brightest stars ( region 346a ) .    after correcting region 346a for extinction , based on the four brightest balmer lines",
    ", it is found that the weaker balmer lines ( h9 to h12 ) are not affected by stellar underlying absorption ( see figure 1 ) , therefore the he lines are not expected to be affected by underlying absorption .",
    "the extinction derived from the balmer lines is in very good agreement with the extinction derived from the stellar cluster by massey , parker , & garmany ( 1989 ) , another indication that the stellar underlying absorption of the balmer lines is negligible .",
