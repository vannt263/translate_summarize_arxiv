    "measurement of luminosity distance of the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite during nearly last two decades establishes that the universe is presently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "observation of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiations @xcite , power spectrum of matter distributions in the universe provide other independent evidence in favour of this late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "a general label for the source of this late - time cosmic acceleration is  dark energy \" , which is a hypothetical unclustered form of energy with negative pressure - the negative pressure leading to the cosmic acceleration by counteracting the gravitational collapse .",
    "sne ia observations have revealed that roughly 70% of the content of the present universe consists of dark energy .",
    "the very nature and origin of dark energy still remains a mystery despite many years of research .",
    "there exist diverse theoretical approaches from different viewpoints aiming construction of models for dark energy to explain the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "these include the @xmath11 model @xcite which fits well with the present cosmological observations but is also plagued with the fine tuning problem from the standpoint of particle physics .",
    "alternative field theoretic models based on consideration of specific forms of the energy - momentum tensor with a negative pressure in einstein s equation include quintessence @xcite and @xmath0-essence @xcite where scalar fields with slowly varying potentials and scalar field kinetic energy , respectively , drive the cosmic acceleration .",
    "there also exist other viable models of dark energy based on modification of geometric part of einstein s equation which include @xmath12 gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite and brane world models @xcite .    in this work",
    "we try to address certain issues related to the framework of @xmath0-essence scalar field model of dark energy leading to interesting phenomenological consequences in the context of sne ia observations .",
    "the @xmath0-essence models which involve actions with non - canonical kinetic terms are strong candidates for dark energy . a theory with a non - canonical kinetic term",
    "was first proposed by born and infeld in order to get rid of the infinite self - energy of the electron  @xcite .",
    "similar theories were also studied in  @xcite .",
    "cosmology witnessed these models first in the context of scalar fields having non - canonical kinetic terms which drive inflation .",
    "subsequently @xmath0-essence models of dark matter and dark energy were also constructed .",
    "effective field theories arising from string theories also have non - canonical kinetic terms  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this work comes from the following . a constant potential in the @xmath0-essence ( non - canonical ) lagrangian @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , ensures existence of a scaling relation @xmath15 , @xmath16 is some constant @xcite . recently",
    "a lagrangian for the @xmath0-essence field has been set up for the curvature constant @xmath17 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe incorporating the above mentioned scaling relation @xcite . combining this formalism of non - canonical lagrangian and scaling relation with observational data we determine ( @xmath18 ) the time dependence of the spatially homogeneous scalar field @xmath19 driving the late - time cosmic acceleration and ( @xmath20 ) a form of @xmath4 satisfying the scaling relation .",
    "this is done as follows . for a spatially homogeneous scalar field @xmath19 , einstein s field equations in presence of this scaling relation",
    "leads to the equation : @xmath21 ( derived below in sec",

    "this equation connects the time derivative of the field with the scale factor ( @xmath6 ) and hubble parameter ( @xmath5 ) associated with the expansion of flrw universe .",
    "such an equation holds for a wide class of forms for @xmath4 respecting the scaling relation .",
    "the late - time temporal behaviour of the phenomenological values of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , on the other hand , can be extracted from the measured values of the luminosity distance of observed sne ia events with different redshift ( @xmath23 ) values ranging from @xmath24 .",
    "use of these phenomenological values @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the above equation thus opens up a possibility of determining from observational data the time dependence of the scalar field @xmath19 in the @xmath0-essence model with constant potential , without prior knowledge of any specific form for @xmath4 . in presence of the scaling relation the temporal behaviour of the @xmath0-essence scalar field as obtained from the analysis of sne ia data is found to be fitted with the form : @xmath27 to an appreciable extent of statistical precision .",
    "@xmath28 represents a dimensionless time parameter ( defined in sec .",

    "the numerical values of the constant coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are estimated directly from the analysis of observational data for three different possible values of the curvature constant @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly the observational data is instrumental in not providing rooms for further higher order terms of @xmath28 in the obtained time dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0-essence scalar field responsible for late - time cosmic acceleration is found to have similar time evolution properties to that of a quintessence field responsible for a homogeneous inflation .",
    "it should be mentioned that there also exist scenarios to unify inflation with late - time acceleration in certain interesting versions of modified gravity theories @xcite .    using the scaling relation we can directly compute the dependence of the function @xmath32 on @xmath10 from the observational data upto the multiplicative constant ( appearing in the scaling relation ) where @xmath33 is the value of @xmath10 at the present epoch . for this , we first compute the dependence of @xmath34 on time @xmath28 by numerically integrating the scaling relation . then the time parameter can be eliminated from the obtained time dependences of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , by numerically evaluating both quantities at same values of time @xmath28 . from this we subsequently obtain the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath10 along with @xmath38 and @xmath39 uncertainties owing to the uncertainties in the observational data .",

    "( [ eq : keom ] ) is absent , one obtains the scaling @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath16 is some constant .",
    "we stress here that this scaling relation reflects a fundamental aspect of @xmath0-essence model with constant potential @xmath55 .",
    "the existence of a scaling relation implies presence of relevant scales in the theory .",
    "here this is realized for a constant potential . throughout this work",
    "@xmath55 is a constant and the scaling relation is preserved .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , ( [ eq : density ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling ] ) we get from eq .",

    "we can determine the time dependence of the field @xmath7 from phenomenological values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as extracted from sne ia data .",
    "here we note the following . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : keom ] ) , if @xmath3 is not a constant then to determine the time evolution of @xmath7 from this equation would require prior knowledge of specific forms for @xmath4 and @xmath3 as well . however , if @xmath3 is a constant ( as we have considered ) , scaling relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) ) ensures the existence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffeq ] ) . now determining the time evolution of @xmath7 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffeq ] ) does not require prior knowledge of specific form of @xmath4 , knowing @xmath5 and @xmath6 is enough .",
    "moreover , using @xmath49 , from the scaling relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) ) , it follows that @xmath59 exploiting the time dependences of the scale factor @xmath6 and field @xmath7 as extracted from observational data we can numerically integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdt ] ) to get time dependence of the quantity @xmath60 .",
    "further , the time parameter can be eliminated from the obtained time dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 by numerically evaluating both the quantities at same values of @xmath62 from which we subsequently obtain the @xmath10-dependence the quantity @xmath63 .",
    "now recall standard theories of homogeneous inflation @xcite .",
    "there the potential energy of a homogeneous scalar field @xmath7 , usually called inflaton ( described by lagrangians with canonical kinetic terms ) , leads to the exponential expansion of the universe .",
    "the energy density and the pressure density of the inflaton field can be described respectively , as @xmath64    substituting these in eqs .",

    ", @xmath5 is approximately a constant and the last equation implies @xmath68 .",
    "sne ia observations fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffeq ] ) seem to indicate that a similar time evolution is also true for @xmath0-essence scalar fields where the kinetic energy dominates over the potential energy and the lagrangian has non - canonical kinetic terms .    here",
    "the following should be noted . it may be argued that if @xmath55 is a constant , all @xmath0-essence models behave as quintessence if @xmath69 i.e. @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "however , there is a subtle difference here . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) and ( [ eq : density ] ) , using scaling relation we get @xmath72 for @xmath0-essence",
    ". therefore for @xmath73 , @xmath0-essence can not reduce to quintessence . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 for @xmath0-essence approaches",
    "zero faster than @xmath75 for quintessence .",
    "therefore use of the scaling relation prevents this model for @xmath0-essence from reducing to a model for quintessence for any @xmath10 .",
    "it should be mentioned that for constant @xmath55 the scaling relation is a fundamental attribute obtained from the hydrodynamic model and einstein s equation .",
    "therefore there is no chance of the quintessence and @xmath0-essence models coinciding for @xmath74 .",
    "moreover it will be shown below that @xmath76 is non - zero from sne ia observations .    here",
    "we mention another point . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "since friedmann equations relate @xmath77 to the total energy density of the universe , the best we can do from any geometrical observation is to determine the total energy density of the universe at any given time .",
    "it is not possible to determine the energy densities of individual components from any geometrical observation .",
    "therefore observationally dark energy is difficult to pinpoint .",
    "hence distinguishing between quintessence and @xmath0-essence scalar fields is not possible by considering total energy densities .",
    "however , in the previous paragraph we have seen that for @xmath78 the theoretical behaviour of @xmath75 is different for quintessence and @xmath0-essence scenarios under certain conditions ( scaling relation holds for @xmath0-essence only ) .",
    "the sne ia data remain the key observational ingredient in determining cosmological parameters related to dark energy .",
    "one possible way of examining a theoretical model of dark energy involves parametrisation of quantities like luminosity distance or the hubble parameter or the dark energy equation of state in terms of redshift .",
    "the constants of such parametrisations show up in the expressions for the cosmological quantities like the scale factor @xmath26 and the hubble parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical values of these constants can then be found by fitting it to the observational data . in this work ,",
    "we have assumed a closed form parametrisation of the luminosity distance , @xmath79 @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the speed of light and @xmath82 the value of the hubble parameter at the present epoch defined through the dimensionless quantity @xmath83 by @xmath84 km s@xmath85 mpc@xmath85 .",
