    "the dynamical mass ( @xmath0 ) of a galaxy is a fundamental property of galaxies at low and high redshift . in combination with measurements of the baryonic mass , it provides information on the amount of dark matter in galaxies . in the nearby universe",
    ", galaxies can in principle be well resolved and a rotation curve can be derived to accurately constrain @xmath0 as well as derive information on the distribution and importance of dark matter .",
    "this is frequently done by using interferometric observations to measure the doppler - shift of the 21cm emission line of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "if a galaxy is not sufficiently resolved , then the derived rotation curve is no longer a true reflection of the mass distribution .",
    "however , even with spectroscopic data that are spatially unresolved or have a low spatial resolution , the amplitude of the rotational motions can still be used to derive an approximate value of the dynamical mass .",
    "usually this is done by deriving the ` global profile ' of a galaxy : this shows the emission or flux of a galaxy as a function of apparent radial ( doppler ) velocity . for local spiral galaxies with flat rotation curves and extended gas disks , the global profile takes the shape of the well - known ` double - horned profile ' , caused by the accumulation of doppler - shifted emission at the projected velocities corresponding to the amplitude of the flat part of the rotation curve . in the absence of spatially resolved data ,",
    "the global profile is usually the only option for estimating the dynamical mass .",
    "this situation occurs for single - dish hi surveys of the local universe ( such as hipass or alfalfa ) , but also for interferometric observations of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the velocity width @xmath5 of the global profile gives an indication of ( twice ) the amplitude of the inclination - projected rotation of a galaxy .",
    "widths are usually determined at 20 or 50 percent of the maximum value of the profile to avoid being affected by noisy regions in the spectrum , and are denoted as @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "an indicative dynamical mass can be defined as @xmath8/g$ ] , where @xmath5 is the velocity width also needs to be corrected for instrumental effects such as the finite width of velocity channels .",
    "we will however ignore this in this paper .",
    "] , @xmath9 is the inclination of the galaxy , @xmath10 the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 a representative radius . for a good estimate of the total dynamical mass",
    ", this radius should ideally be the maximum radius at which the tracer can still be observed .",
    "some of the most common choices for @xmath11 are the radius of the hi disk or the optical disk .",
    "in the rest of this paper we use @xmath12 .    one important aspect that is often under - appreciated",
    "is that global profiles are not only determined by the rotation curve of a galaxy , but also by the spatial distribution of the tracer gas within that galaxy . to date , most measurements of global profiles of low - redshift galaxies are based on hi measurements .",
    "neutral hydrogen has the advantage that it usually extends much further out than the optical disk , thus tracing the rotation at large radii , and in many cases it comfortably reaches the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "it also has a high area - covering factor and , to first order , constant surface density .",
    "these three properties together ensure that global profiles based on hi observations usually yield a good representation of the dynamics of galaxies .",
    "this is also the underlying reason why measurements of global hi profiles have been successfully used in evaluating dynamical masses and relations such as the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation @xcite .",
    "while hi - based global profiles are therefore an important and convenient tool for low - redshift studies , this is not the case for higher redshifts . with current instrumentation ,",
    "hi emission is difficult to observe beyond the local universe .",
    "only a relatively small number of galaxies have been observed directly in hi at larger redshifts out to @xmath13 with significant investments of observing time ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even with large future telescopes such as the ska , it is unlikely that large numbers of galaxies will be routinely observed in emission in hi beyond @xmath14 without major investments in observing time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies of the gas in galaxies at these higher redshifts have mainly used the co line , which is the brightest tracer of the cold molecular gas component ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the co line is intrinsically much brighter than the hi line .",
    "however , an important difference with hi is that the co distribution is known to be more compact , at least in detailed studies of nearby galaxies . here",
    "the co distribution rarely extends beyond the optical radius @xmath15 . also , in contrast with the almost constant hi surface density , the co surface density decreases exponentially with radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this immediately implies that co can trace the rotation curve of a galaxy only out to a fraction of the radius that would in principle be traceable by hi .",
    "that is , for a given rotation curve , the global profile as measured in hi will look different from the one measured in co.    finally , global profiles are also affected by the velocity dispersion of the gas . low - redshift disk galaxies are very much dominated by rotation ; the typical hi velocity dispersion of @xmath16 km s@xmath2 @xcite is many times smaller than the rotation velocity , and the same is true of the low - redshift co velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "however , at higher redshifts , where there are more actively star - forming environments , the gas velocity dispersion is expected ( and observed ) to be much higher .",
    "measurements of the ionized gas phase of main - sequence star - forming galaxies at @xmath17@xmath18 indicate dispersions of 30100kms@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "direct measurements of the molecular gas dispersion at these redshifts are rare , but indicate dispersion values of @xmath19 kms@xmath2 @xcite to @xmath20 kms@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a fundamental assumption in the evaluation of a global profile is that the galaxy under consideration is rotation - dominated , i.e. , the system is not undergoing a merger , is not accreting massive gas reservoirs that increase the dispersion , and is sufficiently massive that its kinematics are not entirely dominated by dispersion . at low redshift , most galaxies are rotation - dominated , and interacting systems are easily identified by their morphology . at high redshift , the situation is more difficult to assess from an observational perspective .",
    "however , there is growing evidence that many of the @xmath21 galaxies observed at higher redshifts are in fact rotation - dominated , even if based on their infrared luminosities one would classify them as ulirgs ( i.e. , @xmath22 ; at low redshift ulirgs are known to be interacting systems , but they constitute `` main sequence '' galaxies at high redshift ) .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to quantify the kinematics of high - redshift galaxies , mostly using optical emission lines and integral field units on 10 m - class telescopes .",
    "early studies showed that @xmath23 of spatially resolved galaxies were dispersion - dominated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "new observations of a sample of @xmath24 galaxies with improved spatial resolution ( using ao - assisted imaging ; @xcite ) have now shown that some of the galaxies thought to be dispersion - dominated in earlier studies are in fact rotating .",
    "these authors argue that the larger the size of the galaxy , the more rotation - dominated it is , as is expected ( and found in the local universe ) if galaxies have maximum rotation velocities that scale with size and have velocity dispersions that are independent of size . @xcite",
    "also highlight the issue of `` beam smearing '' which artificially increases the observed dispersion in semi - resolved measurements .    in summary",
    ", even though it is expected that a fraction of high - redshift galaxies is not rotation dominated ( due to mergers etc . )",
    ", recent observational evidence clearly demonstrates that a significant fraction of this galaxy population is rotating . in this paper",
    "we therefore assume galaxies that are rotation dominated , down to masses where the dispersion becomes a significant contributor .",
    "we quantify how the choice of gas tracer and its intrinsic distribution ( from constant surface density to ultra - compact distributions ) changes the estimated dynamical mass of a given galaxy using a number of galaxy rotation curve templates . in sect .  2",
    "we describe the method we use to derive the profiles and the assumptions we make in that process . in sect .  3 , we discuss the resulting velocity widths and their impact on galaxy scaling relations .",
    "section 4 deals with the problem of finding a length scale over which dynamical masses are computed .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sect .  5 .",
    "here we briefly describe the method used to generate the global profiles . in sect .  2.1 , we first summarize the procedure used to calculate global profiles given an input rotation curve and a radial gas surface density distribution .",
    "section  2.2 describes the properties of the sample of rotation curves we use in this analysis .",
    "section  2.3 addresses our choices for the radial surface density profiles .",
    "we follow the method described in @xcite and briefly summarize the main features here . the line profile of an edge - on , optically thin , filled",
    ", flat ring with a constant circular velocity @xmath25 and a luminosity of unity can be derived as follows .",
    "the apparent observed ( radial ) velocity @xmath26 of a point on the ring is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle with the line of sight .",
    "evaluating the change in @xmath29 as a function of @xmath28 , the normalized edge - on line profile of the ring can be written ( following the notation from @xcite ) as @xmath30 this equation does not take into account the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "a velocity dispersion @xmath31 can be incorporated in the above description as a convolution of @xmath32 with a gaussian with dispersion @xmath31 , yielding a line profile @xmath33 .",
    "this procedure also softens the discontinuities @xmath32 has for @xmath34 .",
    "we assume the velocity dispersion to be isotropic .",
    "@xcite take into account flux normalizations of the profiles",
    ". as we are only concerned with the relative changes of the line profiles , and linewidths are not affected by normalizations , we here ignore these normalization factors .",
    "so far , we have assumed rings with a luminosity of unity .",
    "the distribution of the gas in a galaxy can be taken into account by multiplying @xmath33 of each ring with the luminosity ( or gas mass ) in that ring .",
    "the total global profile @xmath35 can be calculated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the width of a ring ( with @xmath38 chosen to be small compared to the extent of the galaxy ) , @xmath39 is the azimuthally averaged radial profile of the gas distribution , @xmath40 the circular velocity curve , which is usually taken to be equal the rotation curve , and @xmath11 is the maximum measured radius of the gas distribution .",
    "note that we do not take into account optical depth effects .",
    "the line profile of a non - edge - on galaxy can be calculated by multiplying @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath41 before convolving with the velocity dispersion gaussian .",
    "the procedure described here thus allows calculation of global profiles for any given combination of surface density profile and rotation curve and arbitrary values of inclination and velocity dispersion .      to calculate global profiles comparable to those typically observed ( at least at low redshift ) ,",
    "we need representative rotation curves as input , preferably over a comprehensive range of galaxy masses and luminosities .",
    "we here use a set of template rotation curves from @xcite .",
    "they used long - slit optical rotation curves and @xmath42-band photometry of @xmath43 low - redshift disk galaxies to construct average template rotation curves for ten separate luminosity classes , spanning six magnitudes in @xmath42-band luminosity , ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( approximately equal to a range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , assuming @xmath48 ; cf .",

    "table 2 ) . for convenience",
    "we denote these luminosity classes with a numerical code @xmath49 , with @xmath50 corresponding to the brightest luminosity class and @xmath51 to the faintest luminosity class ( see also tab .  [",
    "tab : template ] ) .",

    "@xcite parameterise these curves using the so - called polyex model @xcite , @xmath54    here @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 describe the amplitude of the rotation curve , the steepness of the inner rise of the curve , and the slope of the outer part , respectively .",
    "the average luminosities of each luminosity class and the parameters of the corresponding polyex fits , taken from @xcite , are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : template ] . for a full discussion of curves and fits we refer to @xcite . in the following we will be adopting the polyex fits as our fiducial template curves",
    "this has the advantage that small - scale variations in the rotation curve do not affect the results .",
    "the curves and polyex fits with radii expressed in scale lengths are shown in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : templates ] .",
    "we will be varying the distribution of the gas tracer in our models and therefore need to define a representative reference length scale for each template rotation curve .",
    "we here choose the optical exponential disk scale length @xmath52 , which , as noted , is also the unit of radius of the @xcite template curves .",
    "it is useful to also express the rotation curve radii in kpc units , and we calculate values for the scale lengths @xmath52 as follows .",
    "first , we assume that the template galaxies are freeman - disks ( i.e. , that they have a central disk surface brightness of @xmath58 mag arcsec@xmath59 ) , which is a reasonable assumption for this range in luminosity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that as we are ignoring normalisation factors in this analysis , the exact choice of central surface brightness value is not critical . using an average colour for these galaxies of @xmath48 ( as also used above ) , we calculate the freeman - value in the @xmath42-band . by assuming exponential disks , we can use @xmath60 to calculate the exponential scale length @xmath52 . here",

    "[ fig : templates ] shows that all curves extend to @xmath53 ; the right panel shows that the decrease in scale length from high to low luminosity ( or , equivalently , galaxy mass ) results in the curves extending less far ( in terms of kpc ) as luminosity decreases .",
    "a maximum radius of @xmath65 agrees well with the typical sizes of h i disks in nearby disk galaxies . for a sample of 108 nearby gas - rich disk galaxies ,",
    "@xcite find a relation between the hi radius @xmath66 ( defined at the @xmath67 column density level ) and the optical radius @xmath15 ( defined at the 25 @xmath68-mag arcsec@xmath59 level ) of @xmath69 . for nearby disk galaxies",
    "@xmath70 , yielding an hi radius @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath65 maximum radius used here is therefore a reasonable approximation of that found in real disk galaxies .",
    "the rotation curves described here are derived from local galaxies .",
    "are they also applicable to high - redshift galaxies ?",
    "as described in the introductions , there is good evidence that a substantial fraction of galaxies at higher redshifts are domination by rotation .",
    "in addition , the tf relation , one of the most well - defined relations involving rotating disk galaxies , seems to be in place already by @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and there are indications it may already exist by @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though with an offset in stellar mass .",
    "galaxies with well - defined rotation curves with a range in maximum rotation velocities overlapping with that observed locally can thus be presumed to exist at higher redshifts as well .",
    "we will later show that the global profiles are only moderately sensitive to the exact shape of the rotation curve .",
    "whether the gas distributions at higher redshifts are similar to those found locally is an open question . however , as described in the following subsection , we circumvent this by calculating global profiles for a large range of surface density profiles .",

    "we find very good agreement and proceed to use the analytical profiles in the rest of this paper .",
    "the large range in radial density profiles presented here enables evaluation of profiles based on a situation that deviates from what is found locally . if , for example , the observed co distribution at high redshift is more compact than what is observed at low redshift ( because high-@xmath92 co transitions have been observed , or because of a radially changing co - to - h@xmath93 conversion factor , e.g. , due to steep metallicity gradients ) , then it is easy to calculate the profile for a smaller @xmath90-value .",

    "rather , we evaluate profiles covering a range in maximum rotation velocities and gas densities that overlaps with what is found observationally .",
    "a comparison with these observations should therefore be made under the following assumptions : 1 ) galaxies are virialised and dominated by rotation ; 2 ) galaxies do not suffer from major interactions and/or asymmetries ( though the latter will have only a minor impact on @xmath7 ) ; 3 ) rotation curves are to first order independent of redshift ( as hinted at by the existence of a high - redshift tf relation ) ; 4 ) the range in gas density profiles presented here covers that found in real galaxies .    also note that the surface density of the tracer component is not relevant for our models , as we only evaluate normalized global profiles . in order to model more compact or more extended gas distributions only the scale length @xmath90 needs to be adjusted",
    "for each of the template rotation curves ( @xmath49-types ) , we calculate global profiles , assuming exponential radial gas density profiles with scale lengths @xmath94 , where @xmath52 is the ` standard ' scale length for each template galaxy class as listed in tab .  1",
    ". we also calculate global profiles for a constant surface density filled disk and an exponential disk with an s11 scale length @xmath89 .",
    "gas distributions are in all cases truncated at a radius of @xmath65 .",
    "we calculated many sets of global profiles assuming different combinations of inclination and velocity dispersion .",

    "the steepness of the gas profiles is indicated by the color of the profile ( as indicated in the bottom - right panel ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_i90 ] , we see that for the low-@xmath49 , low - dispersion , constant - surface - density models the double - horned signature of the profiles is very pronounced . in contrast , for very steep gas profiles , where the density has already become negligible at radii where the rotation velocity has not reached the flat part yet , the horns disappear , resulting in a more gaussian profile .",
    "this is an effect that we see for all parameter combinations .",
    "it is most pronounced at higher @xmath49-values , where due to the slower rising rotation curves , the horns already disappear for moderately steep gas profiles .        as the value of the velocity dispersion increases ( bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_i90 ] ) , we see that the horns are less pronounced , with the profiles becoming gaussian or flat - topped over a large range of parameter combinations .",
    "this could be an explanation why many co spectra of galaxies at high redshift do not exhibit the double - horn shape .",
    "for example , the majority of the quasar host galaxies show profiles that are well fit by just a simple gaussian ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is also the case for most of the sub - millimeter galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent large samples of main sequence galaxies have also revealed predominantly gaussian co profile shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the double - horned profiles that are observed at high redshifts are most often associated with massive galaxies , which must have steeply rising rotation curves or very extended molecular gas disks to ensure that the double - horned signature remains visible .",
    "for example , the double - horned co profiles shown in @xcite belong to high - redshift galaxies with velocity widths 400600 km s@xmath2 , which , in terms of velocity width , are comparable with the @xmath50 or @xmath99 galaxies as discussed here ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_i90 ] ) .    in the majority of cases , the apparent velocity width of the profile becomes discernibly smaller as the steepness of the gas surface density profile increases .",

    "the values of @xmath7 are largely unaffected for gas distributions that have scale lengths @xmath100 ( i.e. , extended distributions ) .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath90 ( compact distributions ) , the measured values decrease rapidly , especially for the less luminous galaxies ( high @xmath49-values ) . for the s11 profile , the ratio of the measured @xmath7 value and the value for a constant surface density disk decreases from slightly less than unity for @xmath50 to @xmath101 for @xmath51 .",
    "these trends are visible for both values of the velocity dispersion .",
    "note that for @xmath102 km s@xmath2 , we see a different behavior for the smallest @xmath90 values . in this case",
    "the velocity dispersion dominates the measured @xmath7 values , and we see a flattening of the decrease in @xmath7 as a function of decreasing @xmath90 .",
    "these findings have direct consequences for the interpretation of scaling relations involving a velocity width .",
    "perhaps the most famous of these is the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation @xcite .",
    "this relation between the luminosity and velocity linewidth of galaxies has been used as a distance indicator , but the apparent universality of the tf relation has meant that it has also become an important part of studies of the dark and baryonic matter content of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the tf relation is most often studied using hi as a tracer for the dynamics . here",
    "we investigate whether the parameters of the tf relation , in particular the slope , are sensitive to changes in the radial profile of the tracer gas .",

    "for comparison , the tf relation as defined by the rotation velocities at the outermost point of the template rotation curves is also shown .",
    "note that @xcite finds an @xmath42-band tf slope of @xmath104 , based on global profile velocity widths in an hi - study of the tf relation of regular disk galaxies in the ursa major cluster ( the value quoted here applies to their ` de sample ' ) . in general , hi - based studies of the tf relation tend to find slopes @xmath105",

    "the flat and extended density profiles we find tf - slopes that are in reasonable agreement with those found in the detailed tf study by @xcite mentioned earlier , but note that the tf - slope starts to decrease around @xmath109 .",
    "the slope of the tf relation derived assuming s11 density profiles has decreased by a full unit compared to the value found for flat density profiles .",
    "the slope thus depends on the steepness of the density profile , and for the models considered here a ` co'-tf would be less steep than an ` h i'-tf .",
    "this conclusion applies to any density profile steeper than @xmath110 .",
    "results for a velocity dispersion of 50 km s@xmath2 are similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] , bottom - row ) , with the one difference that at low linewidths the dynamics are clearly dominated by the dispersion . nevertheless , also here , a tf measured in co would have a more shallow slope than an hi - based tf .",
    "when velocity widths are used to estimate dynamical masses , the differences due to the different tracer gas profiles directly propagate into the mass estimates through the _ square _ of the difference via @xmath111 .",
    "a second complication is that a radius @xmath11 is needed for the calculation of the dynamical mass . in practice ,",
    "when one has to resort to using @xmath7 for dynamical mass estimates , this usually means that the observations of the gas component are unresolved or , at best , semi - resolved , and @xmath11 can not be measured directly .",
    "it is therefore customary to _ assume _ a radius that is deemed appropriate for a given tracer . in the case of high - redshift co observations of main sequence galaxies",
    ", this is typically chosen to be the optical radius , based on the results found for nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the few marginally resolved co measurements at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in dealing with these observations , one has to be aware of possible mismatches between the distribution of the tracer and the assumed radius for the dynamical mass .          to address the problem of choosing the appropriate radius",
    ", we will here use our models of the global profiles to identify radii that are intrinsic to the tracer distribution used . in combination with the global profile , this radius",
    "can then be used to give a consistent estimate of the dynamical mass assuming a radius appropriate for the chosen gas distribution .    in the following we will ,",
    "for brevity , only discuss the cases for flat ( ` hi ' ) , @xmath112 ( ` exponential ' ) and @xmath113 ( ` co ' ) density profiles , but results for other density profiles can be derived in a similar manner . for each of the three surface density distributions ,",
    "we identify in the template rotation curves those radii that show the same rotation velocity as the @xmath114 values of the corresponding global profile .",
    "as the rotation curve velocities do not contain a dispersion component , we compare with @xmath7 values derived from global profiles we calculate assuming zero dispersion , hereafter denoted as @xmath115 .",
    "we return to the impact of the velocity dispersion at the end of this subsection .",
    "figure [ fig : curvescale ] shows the template rotation curves again , with the radii given in units of @xmath52 . in the figure , we also indicate with arrows the measured @xmath116 values for each combination of @xmath49-type and the three density profiles ( flat , exponential and s11 ) .",
    "we also indicate the radii at which these velocities occur .",
    "it is immediately clear that each type of density profile is associated with its own distinct range in radii . for the flat density profiles ,",
    "the @xmath115 value measured is associated with a radius of @xmath117 ; the exponential profile with a radius of @xmath118 , and the s11 profile with @xmath119 .    a @xmath115 velocity width determined in hi ( i.e. , with a flat density profile ) is thus measuring the rotation velocity that is typically found at @xmath53 , and the latter is therefore the appropriate radius to use in calculating the dynamical mass . assuming an s11 profile instead",

    "the co distribution and radii discussed here apply , strictly speaking , only to local galaxies .",
    "should the co distribution in high - redshift galaxies be different , then an appropriate , different value of @xmath90 can be chosen and corresponding radii derived .",
    "-type , as indicated by the numbers in the right - most part of the plot .",
    "corrections more than @xmath121 should be treated with care , as they indicate the global profile is not dominated by rotation .",
    "[ fig : dispratio ] ]    dynamics of real galaxies contain a dispersion term : for the three density profiles we discuss here we have calculated the ratio of velocity widths that include a dispersion and the zero - dispersion velocity widths .",
    "these ratios are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispratio ] . for the flat density profile ,",
    "corrections rise approximately linearly with dispersion , until they reach values of @xmath122 at @xmath123 km s@xmath2 for all but the latest @xmath49-types where the corrections are much higher .",
    "the exponential density profiles shows somewhat smaller corrections than the flat density profile , peaking at @xmath124 , with again the late @xmath49-types showing larger corrections .",
    "the s11 profile yields larger corrections overall , with the latest types already diverging at intermediate dispersions . note that for the s11 profiles , and to a lesser extent also the exponential profiles , we find some ratios that are slightly less than unity .",
    "this is a real effect , with the larger dispersions moving flux to more extreme velocities , giving the central profiles a slightly more narrow core .",
    "the larger corrections with increasing density profile steepness show how the steep density profiles ensure that a relatively small part of the inner rotation curve is sampled , causing the velocity dispersion to have a higher impact .",
    "profiles with corrections that deviate strongly from the locus of curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispratio ] are thus unlikely to retain much information about the rotation of the galaxy , as can also be deduced from comparing profile shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_i90 ] .",
    "corrections higher than @xmath124 to @xmath122 should therefore be treated with caution as the profile retains little rotational information .",
    "given an observed global profile and assumed mass density profile , one can therefore estimate a representative dynamical mass using the velocity - dispersion - corrected velocity width and the corresponding characteristic radius .      in the previous subsection we derived the characteristic radii using the input rotation curves .",
    "this is an illustrative way of defining and locating the characteristic radii , but we can also derive these directly from the global profile .",
    "this has the advantage that the velocity dispersion can be taken into account directly . to derive characteristic radii from the profile , recall eqn .",
    "this describes the value of the global profile at velocity @xmath26 as the weighted sum of the fluxes that the individual line profiles corresponding to each radius @xmath125 produce at @xmath26 . the flux in each ring , @xmath126 , thus serves as the weighting factor for @xmath33 of each ring .",
    "we can now calculate the weighted mean radius at each @xmath26 and identify for each value of @xmath26 the radius which , in terms of weighted mean average , is the dominant contributor to the total flux at that velocity .",
    "this then makes it possible to determine the characteristic radii that give rise to the flux at the velocities that define @xmath7 .    defining the weights @xmath127 , the weighted mean radius @xmath128 for each value of @xmath26",
    "is given by @xmath129    in fig .",
    "[ fig : profradii ] we plot the radii @xmath130 for the @xmath131 km s@xmath2 profiles that are also shown in fig .",

    "we also indicate the radii at which @xmath7 occurs .",
    "we see a similar trend as the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvescale ] , where the more compact density profiles have smaller characteristic radii .",
    "we can , analogous to eqn .",
    "4 , derive the weighted standard deviation of the radii contributing to @xmath26 using @xmath132 where @xmath128 is the weighted mean from eqn .  4 , and @xmath133 is the number of profiles of individual rings ( radii ) ( as defined in eqn .",
    "1 ) that have a non - zero contribution to the total global profile at @xmath26 ( as defined in eqn .  2 ) . for our models , @xmath133 will be large and @xmath134 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : radii10 ] ( top - left panel ) we plot the mean radii @xmath128 where @xmath7 occurs ( i.e. , the equivalents of the radii indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvescale ] ) as a function of @xmath49-type assuming @xmath95 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we also show the corresponding standard deviation @xmath135 , but again only present results for the flat , exponential and s11 density profiles .",
    "the characteristic radii for each density profile are well separated for all @xmath49-values .",
    "the average values for the radii we find are @xmath136 for the flat profile , @xmath137 for the exponential profile , and @xmath138 for the s11 profile ( not taking into account the standard deviations ; the quoted uncertainties are the uncertainties in the mean ) .",
    "these radii agree very well with those derived based on the rotation curves ( see sect .",
    "results for @xmath139 km s@xmath2 are similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radii10 ] , bottom - left panel ) .",
    "we test how robust the characteristic radii are against changes in the shape of rotation curve .",
    "one would expect that , to first order , the velocity width derived from a global profile does not depend on the precise shape of the rotation curve , but is determined mainly by the amplitude of the rotation , the steepness of the density profile and the velocity dispersion .",
    "we recalculate global profiles for the edge - on case , using the usual three density profiles , but now assume flat or declining rotation curves .",
    "to do this we modify the @xcite template polyex curves by changing the @xmath57 parameter as defined in eqn .  ( 3 ) and given in tab .  1 .",
    "this has the effect of changing the outer slope , but does not affect the inner rise of the rotation curve .",
    "for the flat rotation curves we simply set the value for the outer slope @xmath57 to zero .    choosing a value for @xmath57 for the declining curves is more complicated , as we want to be guided by the declining curves observed in real galaxies , as opposed to modeling arbitrarily steeply declining slopes .",
    "we therefore fit the polyex model to the two most steeply declining hi rotation curves in the things sample @xcite , namely ngc 4736 and ngc 2903 .",
    "unfortunately , for both these galaxies the inner slope is not tightly constrained ( for ngc 4736 due to absence of hi in the center ; for ngc 2903 due to streaming motions induced by the central bar ) , leading to some degeneracy between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 fit parameters . for ngc 4736",
    "we find values of @xmath57 between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "when the part of the rotation curve of ngc 2903 that is affected by the bar is not taken into account , we find @xmath142 . fitting the full curve yields @xmath143 ,",
    "though this value is likely affected by the uncertain inner rotation curve and the associated uncertainy in @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , to be conservative , we adopt a value @xmath144 , which we regard as a hard limit on the value of @xmath57 found in real disk galaxies with declining rotation curves .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radii10 ] .",
    "we see that the characteristic radius of the flat density distribution has decreased somewhat for both flat and declining rotation curves , but they do not differ dramatically from the ones found for the original template rotation curves . given the extreme outer slope we have adopted for the declining curve , it is therefore still justified to use a characteristic radius of @xmath145 to @xmath53 for determining the dynamical mass using any global profile that assumes a flat tracer profile .",
    "the characteristic radii for the s11 distribution also show little change and remain around @xmath86 .",
    "the results for @xmath139 km s@xmath2 show much less difference when comparing the template , flat and declining rotation curve models , due to the more dominant velocity dispersion . nevertheless , to first order the radii derived for the low - dispersion case also hold here .",
    "these results thus show that the shape of the global profile is not critically dependent on the shape of the rotation curve .",
    "the global velocity profile of a galaxy is often used as a means to estimate its dynamical mass .",
    "the profile is determined by the rotation curve of a galaxy , the gas distribution within a galaxy and the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "we have investigated how the global profile changes as a function of these parameters .",
    "this is important due to the different ways global velocity profiles are typically determined at low and high redshifts .",
    "local measurements of global velocity profiles mostly use hi observations .",
    "local hi disks usually have modest velocity dispersions , are extended with an almost constant surface density and sample the outer parts of the rotation curves well . on the other hand , co ( the main ism tracer at high redshift ) has a radial distribution that ( at least for nearby galaxies ) is known to be much steeper with an exponential decline .",
    "in addition , the velocity dispersion at high redshift is probably higher than in local galaxies .",
    "the difference in properties and distribution of the tracers can thus lead to differences in global profile widths and dynamical masses .",
    "while the results presented here are generally applicable , for a comparison with real high - redshift galaxies we have to assume 1 ) that these galaxies are virialised and dominated by rotation ; 2 ) that they are not majorly affected by interactions and/or asymmetries ( though the latter will only have a small impact on @xmath146 ; 3 ) that rotation curves at high - redshift are to first order the same as at low redshift ; 4 ) and that the range of gas density profiles modeled here overlaps with that in real galaxies . choosing a different gas density profile from the range modelled here will account for the possibility that in high - redshift galaxies the gas distribution may be different from that in a low - redshift galaxy .",
    "a first conclusion from the modeling of these profiles is that higher velocity dispersion and steeper density profiles result in less pronounced double - horned profiles .",
    "this is consistent with high - redshift co observations of galaxies , as discussed in sect .  3.1",
    ". galaxies with identical dynamics will have different global profiles , depending on the gas tracer used in the observations .",
    "the steeper density profiles associated with co give smaller velocity widths for otherwise identical rotation curves .",
    "the ratio between co and hi @xmath7 values changes from @xmath147 for the most luminous galaxies we modeled ( @xmath50 , or @xmath148 ) to @xmath149 for the faintest galaxies ( @xmath51 or @xmath150 ) .",
    "this change affects the inferred slope of the tf - relation as well .",
    "the template rotation curves we use , in combination with a flat , constant - density distribution of the gas ( ` hi ' ) , give a @xmath7-based tf slope of @xmath151 .",
    "using an s11 distribution for the gas ( ` co ' ) instead , decreases the slope to @xmath152 .",
    "these numbers assume a 10 km s@xmath2 velocity dispersion , but the same decrease in slope is observed for the 50 km s@xmath2 models .",
    "when global profiles are used for dynamical mass estimates , resolved observations are usually not available and a radius must be assumed to calculate the dynamical mass . usually an optical radius is used for this , though the definition of this radius not well constrained . to get around having to make an arbitrary choice for a radius , we calculate the effective radius of the rotation curve that gives rise to the measured @xmath7 value for a number of combinations of rotation curves and density profiles .",
    "we find that each gas density profile results in its own narrow range of characteristic radii , thus enabling a determination of the dynamical mass using a velocity width and a radius that is appropriate for the tracer used .",
    "velocity widths @xmath7 measured in hi ( with a flat density profile ) typically originate at @xmath53 , while velocity widths derived using the s11 density profile ( equivalent to low - redshift co distributions ) originate at @xmath120 .",
    "these results thus give us , for a range in gas density profile slopes , a consistent definition for the length scales to use in determining dynamical masses .",
