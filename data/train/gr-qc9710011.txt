    "the grand challenge for supercomputers in numerical relativity is the simulation of the inspiral and merger of two black holes , and the computation of the gravitational radiation emitted in the process .",
    "if this event is to be described in full relativistic glory , the use of supercomputers is inevitable .",
    "an alternative to this approach is the use of perturbation theory : if the colliding black holes start out so close to each other that they have already formed a common horizon , they can be treated as a linearized perturbation of a single , spherically symmetric black hole , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 1 + 1=1 ] .",
    "this method is less complicated and requires considerably less computer resources ( cpu time , memory ) , than the full , non - linear approach .",
    "furthermore , additional analytic insight can be gained which is not accessible in the supercomputer computation .    to    [ 1 + 1=1 ]",
    "the full spacetime metric is written as a background metric plus a small perturbation : @xmath0 we will use the schwarzschild metric as the background metric @xmath1 .",
    "the field equations are then linearized around the background metric , yielding linear equations for the perturbation .      the spherical symmetry of the background metric allows the separation of the angular variables , and eventually the reduction of the perturbation equations to a single , one - dimensional wave equation with a potential @xmath2 for a scalar function , the zerilli function @xmath3 : @xmath4 q = 0 \\;.\\ ] ]    there is one such zerilli function for each value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are the usual parameters in the spherical harmonics used for the angular dependence , and for even and odd parity perturbations .",
    "the potential @xmath2 ( and thus the wave equation ) depends on @xmath5 and the parity , but not on @xmath6 .      in order to obtain initial data for the black hole collision ,",
    "we use the approach described by bowen and york @xcite solving the constraint equations assuming a conformally flat initial spatial slice : @xmath7 solutions for the conformal factor @xmath8 describing several initially static wormholes were found by misner @xcite .    for configurations where the black holes are not static initially , we use the solutions given by bowen and york @xcite for the conformal extrinsic curvature @xmath9 \\\\",

    "the extrinsic curvature for several black holes can be obtained by combining contributions from each black hole .",
    "if the initial configuration is not static , then the conformal factor will be different from its misner form .",
    "however , the difference is of second order in the extrinsic curvature .",
    "we can thus ignore the difference , using the misner form , as long as the extrinsic curvature is not too large .",
    "initial data for the zerilli function itself is derived from the initial spatial metric @xcite , the initial derivative is obtained from the extrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "once the time evolution of all relevant zerilli functions is known , the total energy radiated as gravitational radiation during the close collision is given by @xcite @xmath12",
    "the perturbation approach for close collisions was first used by pullin and price @xcite for two initially static black holes .",
    "the results , shown in fig",
    ".  [ inistat ] , indicated excellent agreement with supercomputer calculations for much larger separations than expected . even at @xmath13",

    "=    =    figure  [ iniboost ] shows the radiated energy of two black holes initially boosted towards each other @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the agreement with fully non - linear , numerical calculations also extends to rather large values of the initial momentum .",
    "this is again rather unexpected , since the construction of initial data assumed small extrinsic curvature , and thus small initial momentum .",
    "two counterrotating black holes , with antiparallel spins aligned along the direction of the collision ( `` cosmic screw '' ) , still form an axisymmetric system and result in a final schwarzschild black hole . the radiated energy as a function of spin is shown in fig .  [ screw ] .",
    "if both black holes have a spin of @xmath14 , the rdaiated energy is incerased by about a factor of @xmath15 over the non - rotating case .",
    "other than for supercomputer calculations , axisymmetry does not play a major role in the perturbation approach .",
    "two black holes with antiparallel spins , aligned perpendicular to the line of collision , form a simple non - axisymmetric system .",
    "it is usually expected that the violation of axisymmetry will increase the amount of radiation .",
    "this is not true for this particular situation ; rather , the radiation contributed by the spins is _ lower _ by a factor of @xmath16 , compared to the axisymmetric case .",
    "=    =    boosting the black holes perpendicularly to the line connecting them also violates axisymmetry .",
    "this configuration can be regarded as the start of a collision from a slowly decaying circular orbit .",
    "figure  [ insp ] shows the radiated energy as a function of the resulting orbital angular momentum .",
    "since this case results in a rotating black hole , we can only treat it as a perturbation of a schwarzschild black hole as long as the final angular momentum is small .",
    "however , even for @xmath17 , the emitted radiation increases by about two orders of magnitude , compared to the head - on collision .",
