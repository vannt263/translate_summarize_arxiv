    "by a _ manifold _ we mean a connected , hausdorff topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to some euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "thus we exclude boundaries .",
    "although the manifolds considered here tend , in a sense , to be large , it is straightforward to show that any finite set of points in a manifold lies in an open subset homeomorphic to @xmath0 ; in particular each finite set lies in an arc .",
    "set theory plays a major role in the study of large manifolds ; indeed , it is often the case that the answer to a particular problem depends on the set theory involved . on",
    "the other hand algebraic topology seems to be of less use , at least so far , with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) and @xcite being among the few examples .",
    "perhaps it is not surprising that set theory is of major use while algebraic topology is of minor use given that the former is of greater significance when the size of the sets involved grows , while the latter is most effective when we are dealing with compact sets .",
    "thus a large part of this study involves the determination of relationships between various topological properties when confined to manifolds .",
    "quite a lot of effort has gone into determining whether a particular combination of properties is equivalent to metrisability .",
    "the theory of non - metrisable manifolds is much less developed than that of compact manifolds , but again this is not surprising for , as noted in section 3 , there are many more , @xmath1 , of the former than the latter .",
    "the nearest there is to a classification of non - metrisable surfaces is the bagpipe theorem of nyikos , @xcite , which states that any @xmath2bounded surface is the union of a compact subsurface together with a finite number of mutually disjoint `` long pipes . ''",
    "a space is _",
    "@xmath2bounded _ if every countable subset has compact closure , and a _ long pipe _ is a manifold - with - boundary which is the union of an increasing @xmath3sequence of open subsets each of which is homeomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "the paper @xcite gives an excellent introduction to the theory of non - metrisable manifolds , while @xcite provides a more recent view .",
    "although set theory had been used in the study of manifolds earlier , the solution of the following important question ( @xcite and @xcite ) marks a watershed in its use :    * must every perfectly normal manifold be metrisable ?    a topological space @xmath5 is _ perfectly normal _ provided that for each pair of disjoint closed subsets @xmath6 there is a continuous function @xmath7 $ ] such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the 1970s",
    "it was found that the answer to this question depends on the set theory being used .",
    "more precisely , rudin and zenor in @xcite constructed a counterexample in set theories satisfying zfc ( = zermelo  fraenkel plus the axiom of choice ) and the continuum hypothesis whereas rudin in @xcite proved that in zfc set theories satisfying martin s axiom and the negation of the continuum hypothesis every perfectly normal manifold is metrisable",
    ".    one might identify three levels at which set theory is applied to the study of manifolds . at the basic level is the application of properties which are valid in all set theories ( say those satisfying zfc ) : these include the well - ordering principle ( frequently applied in the form of transfinite induction ) and the pressing down lemma . at the next level is the application of standard axioms which are known to be independent of zfc : these include the continuum hypothesis and martin s axiom . at the third level is the application of such techniques as forcing to construct set theories satisfying certain properties ( of course that is how use of the continuum hypothesis etc is justified , but someone else has already done the hard set theory ) .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the collection of countable ordinals : use the well - ordering principle to well - order an uncountable set and then declare @xmath3 to be the subset consisting of those having only countably many predecessors .",
    "we can topologise @xmath3 by using the order topology .",
    "closed unbounded subsets in this topology play an important role .",
    "any subset of @xmath3 which meets every closed unbounded set is called a _",
    "stationary _ set ; for example the set of all limit points of @xmath3 , indeed any closed unbounded subset , is stationary .",
    "if @xmath10 then a function @xmath11 is called _ regressive _ provided that @xmath12 for each @xmath13 .",
    "the proof of the following proposition may be found in many books on set theory .",
    "let @xmath11 be a regressive function , where @xmath14 is stationary .",
    "then there are @xmath15 and a stationary set @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "* continuum hypothesis , ch*(cantor )    * martin s axiom , ma *    a space has the _ countable chain condition _ (",
    "abbreviated ccc ) provided that every pairwise disjoint family of open sets is countable .",
    "it is well - known that ch is independent of zfc .",
    "it is also the case that ma is independent of zfc but from the baire category theorem it is immediate that ch@xmath18ma .",
    "thus we might expect three possible kinds of zfc set theories in which combinations of ch and ma appear : zfc+ch , zfc+ma+@xmath19ch and zfc@xmath20ma .",
    "all three possibilities do occur . usually in applications other equivalent versions of ma",
    "@xcite contains about 50 conditions equivalent to metrisability for a manifold",
    ". this does not include conditions which are equivalent in a general topological space . nor does it include conditions which are equivalent only in some set theories",
    ". some of the following conditions will be quite familiar , others may be less so .",
    "[ m ] the following conditions are equivalent for a manifold @xmath21 :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 is metrisable ; 2 .",
    "@xmath21 is paracompact ; 3 .",
    "@xmath21 is nearly metalindelf ; 4 .",
    "@xmath21 is lindelf ; 5 .",
    "@xmath21 is second countable ; 6 .",
    "@xmath21 is finitistic ; 7 .",
    "@xmath22 is perfectly normal ; 8 .",
    "@xmath21 may be properly embedded in some euclidean space ; 9 .",
    "there is a cover @xmath23 of @xmath21 such that for each @xmath24 the set st@xmath25 is open and metrisable ; 10 .",
    "the tangent microbundle on @xmath21 contains a fibre bundle .",
    "proof of the equivalence of these conditions will not be given here , refer instead to @xcite where there is a discussion and references .",
    "however , to illustrate the first level of application of set theory here is a sketch of the proof of 9@xmath184 ; full details appear in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be as in 9 and suppose @xmath21 has dimension @xmath26 .",
    "for each @xmath27 define inductively lindelf , connected , open subsets @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be any open subset of @xmath21 homeomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 is any non - zero limit ordinal let @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 is any ordinal and @xmath34 is defined then @xmath34 is separable ; let @xmath35 be a countable dense subset .",
    "then @xmath36 , hence we may let @xmath37 be the component of @xmath38 containing @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 .",
    "connectedness of @xmath21 implies that @xmath42 .",

    "thus @xmath50 so @xmath43 is closed . )",
    "if for some limit ordinal @xmath31 we have @xmath51 then @xmath52 is open and closed , so is all of @xmath21 ( by connectedness ) and hence @xmath21 is lindelf .",
    "suppose instead that for each limit ordinal @xmath31 we have @xmath53",
    ". then @xmath21 can not be lindelf but we will obtain a contradiction . choose @xmath54 , let @xmath55 denote the set of limit ordinals excluding 0 and define the regressive function @xmath56 by @xmath57 then by the pressing down lemma we may choose @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is stationary .    for each @xmath60 choose @xmath61 and let @xmath62 denote the ( open ! ) component of @xmath63 containing @xmath64 .",
    "define @xmath65 by @xmath66 again by the pressing down lemma there is @xmath67 so that @xmath68 is stationary .    because @xmath69 for each @xmath70 , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are countable",
    "whereas @xmath73 is uncountable , we may choose @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that @xmath76 is uncountable .",
    "one can show that @xmath77 is connected ( in fact @xmath78 for each @xmath79 ) and hence @xmath80 is a metrisable manifold , so is hereditarily lindelf .",
    "let @xmath81 .",
    "on the one hand , because @xmath82 and @xmath80 is hereditarily lindelf , @xmath5 is lindelf . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath83 forms an open cover of @xmath5 with no countable subcover , and hence @xmath5 can not be lindelf , a contradiction.@xmath84    while not all terms introduced in theorem [ m ] will be defined here , it is worth noting that the term _ finitistic _ was introduced by swan , @xcite , in his study of the theory of fixed point sets . in @xcite , milnor introduced the notion of microbundle to provide a means of adapting techniques developed for smooth manifolds to the topological context .",
    "much of the impetus was lost when kister in @xcite showed that many microbundles are equivalent to fibre bundles .",
    "condition 10 of theorem [ m ] shows that kister s result goes no further than metrisable manifolds when attention is fixed on the tangent microbundle , which was one of milnor s prime concerns .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rather strong condition of second countability is equivalent to metrisability .",
    "consequently every metrisable manifold is separable .",
    "perhaps this is not surprising in view of the fact that there is a kind of duality between separability and lindelfness .",
    "however it is not hard to construct separable manifolds which are not metrisable , for example the prfer manifold of the next section .",
    "furthermore we have the same set theoretic dilemma as for alexandroff s question : in zfc@xmath85ch one can construct ( see @xcite ) a non - metrisable manifold such that all of its finite powers are hereditarily separable ; the manifold can not be lindelf . on the other hand kunen",
    "has shown in @xcite that in zfc@xmath85ma@xmath20ch every space all of whose finite powers are hereditarily separable is lindelf , hence metrisable if a manifold .",
    "there are only 4 distinct 1manifolds : the circle , @xmath86 , is the only one which is compact ; the real line , @xmath87 , is the only one which is metrisable but not compact ; then there are two non - metrisable 1manifolds , the long line , @xmath88 , and the open long ray , @xmath89 .",
    "the latter two are distinguished by the fact that @xmath88 ( like @xmath86 but unlike @xmath87 and @xmath89 ) is @xmath2bounded .",
    "the _ long line _",
    ", @xmath88 , @xcite , is constructed as follows .",
    "topologise @xmath90 using the lexicographic order , which is defined by @xmath91 provided either @xmath92 or else @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "intervals of the form @xmath95 together with those of the form @xmath96 ( usual meaning for half - open intervals ; we have abbreviated the first element @xmath97 to 0 ) define a basis for the topology of @xmath90 , which thereby becomes the closed long ray",
    ". then @xmath88 is obtained by joining together two copies of @xmath90 at 0 , and @xmath89 is a single copy with 0 removed .",
    "when it comes to 2manifolds , the situation is almost helpless .",
    "on page 669 of @xcite it is shown that there are at least @xmath1 distinct @xmath2bounded , simply connected 2manifolds , @xmath1 being the cardinality of the power set of the first uncountable ordinal @xmath98 .",
    "it is quite a challenge to find enough topological invariants to identify this many distinct surfaces so , as one might expect , this part of the paper makes interesting reading . from @xcite",
    "it follows that there are exactly @xmath1 distinct manifolds ; contrast this with the situation for compact manifolds where , by @xcite , there are only countably many",
    ".    one of the simplest non - metrisable surfaces is the prfer manifold , one version of which is the following .",
    "let @xmath99 write @xmath100 for a typical member @xmath101 of @xmath102 .",
    "set to make it into a manifold , @xmath21 is topologised by using the usual topology on @xmath103 and replacing each point , @xmath104 , of the missing @xmath105axis by the copy , @xmath102 , of the real line .",
    "more precisely , suppose that @xmath106 .",
    "declare @xmath107 to be a neighbourhood basis at @xmath100 , where @xmath108 may be opened out to make room for the interval @xmath109 to give a region homeomorphic to a square .",
    "then @xmath21 is not metrisable because it is not lindelf , containing an uncountable closed discrete subset .    in @xcite and @xcite two modifications",
    "are given to this construction , both giving rise to non - metrisable surfaces which satisfy quite strong conditions .",
    "the authors begin with two disjoint subsets @xmath110 and for each @xmath111 a sequence @xmath112 in @xmath113 converging to @xmath44 .",
    "they let @xmath114 be the union @xmath115 but with points of @xmath113 isolated and neighbourhoods of points of @xmath116 containing tails of the corresponding sequences .",
    "the essential features of @xmath114 are then preserved in a surface constructed along the lines of the prfer manifold .",
    "the idea is essentially to take standard prfer neighbourhoods of points of @xmath103 and @xmath102 whenever @xmath117 while neighbourhoods of points of @xmath102 when @xmath118 also include connected tails of prfer neighbourhoods . in one case @xmath113",
    "is a bernstein subset of @xmath87 ( ie , every uncountable closed subset of @xmath87 meets both @xmath73 and @xmath119 ) ; such a set may be constructed using the axiom of choice so the manifold exists in zfc .",
    "the resulting manifold possesses nice metric - type properties but is not perfect , hence not metrisable . in the other case forcing",
    "is used to construct the set @xmath113 satisfying the extra condition of countable metacompactness , which then carries over to the manifold .",
    "reference has already been made to two surfaces which have been constructed by use of the continuum hypothesis . actually that found in @xcite is a refinement of that in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to start with the _ open _ unit disc @xmath120 together with a half - open interval allocated to each point of the boundary @xmath86 . using ch we may identify the points of @xmath86 with @xmath3 , so the intervals are denoted @xmath121 for @xmath27 .",
    "the manifold has @xmath122 as the underlying set and the topology is obtained from the usual topology on @xmath120 by inserting the interval @xmath121 into the boundary of @xmath120 at the point @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath123 .",
    "the insertion is done by induction on @xmath27 . before beginning ,",
    "the countable subsets of @xmath21 are also indexed by @xmath3 : under ch there are exactly as many countable subsets of @xmath21 as there are points of @xmath3 so we may denote the @xmath33th countable set by @xmath124 . in much the same way as the copy @xmath102 of @xmath87 was inserted into @xmath103 at the point @xmath104 for the prfer manifold , @xmath125 is opened up at @xmath33 to make room for @xmath121 in such a way that for any @xmath41 if @xmath33 is a limit point of @xmath126 then every point of @xmath121 is a limit point of @xmath126 .",
    "this will ensure that @xmath21 is hereditarily separable as we will have ensured that all candidates for countable dense subsets are as dense as needed . at each stage of the induction ch",
    "allows use of @xcite to deduce that @xmath125 is homeomorphic to @xmath120 .",
    "however @xmath21 itself can not be homeomorphic to @xmath120 ; indeed , it is not even metrisable as it is not lindelf .    in his analysis of @xmath2bounded surfaces , nyikos in @xcite constructed a tree associated with a significant class of non - metrisable manifolds , those of type i. a manifold @xmath21 is of _ type i _ provided that there is a sequence @xmath127 of open subsets of @xmath21 such that @xmath128 is lindelf for each @xmath33 , @xmath129 for each @xmath33 , @xmath130 for each limit @xmath31 , and @xmath131 .",
    "given such a manifold and sequence , the tree of non - metrisable component boundaries associated with @xmath132 is the tree @xmath133 consisting of sets of the form @xmath134 where @xmath113 is a non - metrisable component of @xmath135 for some @xmath33 with the order : if @xmath136 then @xmath137 if and only if @xmath73 is a subset of a component whose boundary is @xmath103 .",
    "nyikos then uses this tree to enable him to prove the bagpipe theorem referred to above .    in @xcite",
    ", greenwood gives a method of thickening a tree to a manifold so that when we construct nyikos tree from the manifold we get the original tree back again ( up to isomorphism ) . by analysing the relationship between the manifold and the tree , she uses this construction to help determine when a non - metrisable manifold contains a copy of @xmath3 and/or a closed discrete subset . in some set theories every non - metrisable type i manifold contains either a copy of @xmath3 or an uncountable closed , discrete subspace .",
