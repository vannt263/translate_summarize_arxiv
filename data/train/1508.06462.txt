    "quantum theory has been found to be in full agreement with all experimental tests so far . nevertheless , modified quantum theories are under development , with the goal of solving the so - called measurement problem @xcite , and providing potential bridges towards a not - yet - found unified theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "solid - state mechanical systems in pure nonclassical quantum states of motion , such as squeezed states and entangled states of motion , constitute interesting probe systems to test distinct predictions from modified quantum theories .",
    "a prominent example is the effect of gravity decoherence @xcite , where the system s own gravitational field is conjectured to introduce decoherence to the system s motional state .",
    "an experimental test in which the motional degrees of freedom of a micromechanical oscillator are entangled with the presence or absence of a single photon was proposed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was proposed to test predictions of an effective schrdinger - newton equation for the center of mass motion of a massive object @xcite . here , much heavier mechanical oscillators with eigenfrequencies in the audio - band ( the lower the better ) are preferred .",
    "one might expect that further tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics will be proposed that call for heavy masses in nonclassical states of motion .",
    "pendulum - suspended massive objects might be appropriate systems .",
    "they could constitute interesting probes of modified quantum theories because , at fourier frequencies above the pendulum eigenfrequency , they act as quasi - free falling test masses of space - time . this property is used in gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , pendulum - suspended mirrors usually have a huge thermal excitation and are far from being in a pure quantum mechanical state .    in a recent series of fascinating experiments , mesoscopic mechanical oscillators of micrometre sizes and ghz resonance frequencies",
    "were cooled into their quantum ground states @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation of the oscillator s position was thus of the order of the zero - point fluctuation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the motional mass of the localised acoustic mode , @xmath2 its resonance frequency , and @xmath3 the reduced planck constant .",
    "in all three experiments the average thermal phonon excitation of the oscillator was below one . at a given temperature @xmath4 , the thermal occupation of a mechanical oscillator according to the bose - einstein statistics is given by @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the boltzmann constant .",
    "as a consequence , lower temperatures are necessary to achieve the ground state for mechanical oscillators with lower eigenfrequencies .",
    "the ground state as well as coherent states are pure quantum states , but they are conventionally regarded as ` classical ' since they can be described by positive glauber - sudarshan - p - functions . to produce a _",
    "nonclassical _ state , the mechanical state of motion not only needs to be cooled but also coupled , for instance , to an optical field .",
    "recently , strong coupling was realized in an optomechanical system with an eigenfrequency around 80mhz @xcite . in another work , the quantum coupling of a light field to the motion of a membrane ( at about 1.5mhz ) , with an effective mass of 7ng in terms of radiation pressure noise ( quantum back - action ) ,",
    "was demonstrated @xcite , as well as ponderomotively generated squeezed light in similar regimes @xcite .",
    "if the coupling is sufficiently strong , and the initial mechanical and optical states are of high enough purity , radiation pressure can lead to entanglement between field quadratures of the reflected light and the mirror s position and momentum @xcite .",
    "very recently , entanglement between the motion of a mechanical oscillator and a propagating microwave field was generated using an electromechanical circuit @xcite . in principle , such entanglement can be used to entangle the centre of mass motions of two mechanical oscillators using a protocol that is called ` entanglement swapping ' @xcite , thereby creating a mechanical system that is directly analogous to the einstein - podolsky - rosen gedanken experiment @xcite .    whereas the first proposals for opto - mechanical entanglement generation considered high - finesse cavities to shield the opto - mechanical system from disturbance by the environment , mller - ebhardt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that also an open quantum system , which is realized in a michelson interferometer , is also a suitable configuration to entangle the motion of mirrors .",
    "it was shown that steady - state motional entanglement can even be generated at room temperature if the information about the joint mirror motion that is carried away by the light is continuously acquired by photo - electric detection and used to define a conditional state of mirror motion .",
    "additional requirements are a measurement precision close to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) of an external force measurement ( as defined in @xcite ) , and thus a noise level from coupling to the environment that is below the sql . as shown in @xcite it is in principle possible to conditionally prepare kg - sized mirrors that are suspended as pendula in entangled states with current state - of - the - art gravitational - wave detector technology .    in this work ,",
    "the generation of einstein - podolsky - rosen entangled centre - of - mass motion of two massive and pendulum - suspended mirrors is discussed , building on recent proposals mentioned above @xcite , and a specific michelson - interferometer - type setup is proposed .",
    "the mirrors considered have masses of the order of 0.1 kg , where the word ` massive ' is used as a distinction from just ` macroscopic ' . the latter is often defined to be ` visible to the naked eye ' .",
    "one might define ` massive objects ' to be those whose weight one can feel ( @xmath7 1 g ) , having eigenfrequencies in the audio - band or even below .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide a condensed description of the phenomenon of epr entanglement . in their famous 1935 publication @xcite , albert einstein ,",
    "boris podolsky , and nathan rosen ( epr ) considered two particles in a specific quantum state of motion , which erwin schrdinger called an ( epr ) ` entangled ' state in the same year @xcite .",
    "epr used this particular state to highlight why they believed that quantum theory was incomplete .",
    "their belief originated from an apparent inherent contradiction in quantum theory .",
    "one of the essential features of quantum theory is heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , according to quantum theory , one can not simultaneously know the precise position and momentum of a physical system ` @xmath8 ' .",
    "the product of the uncertainties , here given as variances , has a lower bound given by @xmath9 quantum theory also requires that _ no _ such fundamental lower bound exist for the uncertainties of the _ relative _ positions and momenta of two ( entangled ) physical systems @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 mathematically , both inequalities are direct consequences of the commutation relations @xmath13=i\\hbar \\ , , \\label{eq : comm1}\\ ] ] @xmath14=0 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : comm2}\\ ] ] the second commutator can easily be derived from the first commutator , implying that the two commutators as well as the two inequalities above are fundamentally linked in quantum theory .",
    "further , related commutators are @xmath15=0 $ ] and @xmath16=[\\hat x_a - \\hat x_b,\\hat p_a - \\hat p_b]=2i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "these commutation relations define what position and momentum information about the two systems can simultaneously exist , in principle , and what can not .",
    "the ( apparent ) contradiction in quantum theory arises in the following way .",
    "( [ eq : comm2 ] ) implies that the sum of positions and the difference of momenta of two systems @xmath10 and @xmath11 can simultaneously be defined with arbitrary precision .",
    "this vanishing commutator thus allows for ensembles of pairs where the individual quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as well as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , always have the same eigenvalues . in such ensembles the two components of a pair simultaneously carry some precise position and momentum definition _ with respect to each other_. from the environment s point of view , this allows predicting with certainty the result of a measurement on @xmath10 due to a measurement on @xmath11 , without disturbing @xmath10 .",
    "epr argued that this feature is a sufficient condition for the ` reality ' of system @xmath10 s physical property , i.e.  for the possibility of precisely defining this observable _ with respect to the environment _ before the measurement .",
    "this possibility would simultaneously exist for position _ and _ momentum , and thus would contradict eq .",
    "( [ eq : comm1 ] ) , which generally implies that the position and momentum of any individual system @xmath10 or @xmath11 do not have simultaneous reality .",
    "this contradiction is also known as the ` epr paradox ' @xcite .    to solve this paradox ,",
    "epr conjectured that the wavefunction , as defined by quantum theory , does not provide the full information .",
    "this led to a discussion of whether hidden variables , locally assigned to any system , existed that needed to be included in a complete theory of quantum mechanics .",
    "the experimentally observed violation of bell s inequality @xcite , however , ruled out the existence of ( local ) hidden variables .",
    "based on that , we have to conclude that the assumption made in the introduction of the paper by epr is incorrect .",
    "contrary to what epr assumed , it _ is _ in fact possible to predict the value of an arbitrary observable of a physical system @xmath10 with certainty via a measurement on system @xmath11 , although this observable was not defined before the measurement .",
    "( @xmath21 ) and the phase quadrature @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the dashed circle represents the vacuum ( ground - state ) uncertainty .",
    "when two squeezed input fields ( here without coherent displacement ) are superposed on a ( balanced ) beam splitter , the two output fields individually show a rather large thermal uncertainty area , and are entangled @xcite .",
    "( the ` @xmath24 ' phase flip for one of the beam splitter reflections preserves energy conservation . )",
    "if measurements on system @xmath11 allow inference of the corresponding measurement result on system @xmath10 with an uncertainty below the vacuum state uncertainty , the state is even epr entangled .",
    "the vertical line in @xmath11 s phase space uncertainty represents the result of an amplitude quadrature measurement .",
    "such a measurement implies zero information about the state s phase quadrature .",
    "since @xmath11 s and @xmath10 s amplitude uncertainties are dominated by the phase - squeezed input , their amplitude quadrature measurements are correlated .",
    "in fact , a result at @xmath11 allows us to infer a result at @xmath10 with a remaining uncertainty that corresponds to the squeezed uncertainty of the amplitude - squeezed input .",
    "this uncertainty is indicated by the three vertical lines at @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is similar for phase quadrature measurements , only those are anti - correlated , due to energy conservation and the consequent phase flip at the beam splitter . since the inference uncertainties @xmath25 and @xmath26 are smaller than the vacuum uncertainty , epr entanglement is certified @xcite . for infinitely strong input squeezing the uncertainties @xmath25 and @xmath26 approach zero and",
    "thus resemble maximal epr entanglement and the commutation relation @xmath27=0 $ ] .",
    "note that in this case the local thermal uncertainties of the systems @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of infinite size .",
    ", width=332 ]    the validity of quantum theory has never been put into question by any experimental result to date .",
    "all experiments that target the quantum uncertainty , be it a bell test or a certification of epr entanglement , fundamentally require a statistical approach , i.e.  ensemble measurements .",
    "experiments thus give no information about the consequences of the quantum uncertainty for a single representative of the ensemble , and speculations about these consequences can not be grounded in direct physical observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to interpret quantum physics regarding these consequences and to check whether convincing interpretations can be developed .",
    "the insight above  the fact that the possibility of predicting the value of an observable of @xmath10 with certainty via a measurement on @xmath11 does not require this observable ` to have reality ' before the measurement  may lead to the following picture : first , let s take the process of spontaneous photon pair production as an example for entanglement generation .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion is frequently used to produce entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "generally , a ` spontaneous ' process does not have any _ reason _ , i.e.  it is not triggered or influenced at all by the environment .",
    "( it is also correct to say that the ` reason ' for a spontaneous process is the vacuum uncertainty that itself is fundamentally random . ) consequently , before the first interaction of the new photons with the environment , they are not defined from the environment s point of view ( and the environment is not defined from the photon pair s point of view ) . from this perspective it becomes conclusive that two spontaneously generated photons can not have properties , such as polarizations , that are defined with respect to the environment , before a first interaction defines these properties .",
    "but the photons polarizations may still be defined with respect to each other , and the first interaction with the environment of one of the photons , i.e.  the first ` measurement ' , defines the corresponding property of both .",
    "let s now consider an entangled state of motion .",
    "the entangled systems do not have individual positions or momenta that are defined with respect to the environment before the first interaction , but their positions and momenta may be defined mutually , i.e.  with respect to each other . the basis for such mutual correlations can be due to a joint origin , as it is the case for spontaneous pair production , or due to a force that acted between the systems in the past , as it is envisaged for entangling the motion of heavy objects . in any case , the first interaction with the environment destroys the entanglement and provides information about the position ( or momentum ) of one of the systems , and instantaneously also information about the second system . from this picture",
    "it may be concluded that maximally entangled systems do not have respective physical properties such as individual positions or individual momenta at all . for systems that are",
    "less than maximally entangled , this statement needs to be weakened . in this case the uncertainties / variances in the measurement results of their individual properties describe a _ finite _ phase space region within which a definition of the observables does not exist . abandoning ` reality ' before the first interaction resolves the epr paradox described above .",
    "epr entanglement was observed with position and momentum - like continuous variables in a variety of experiments @xcite .",
    "[ fig1:epr ] illustrates the epr entanglement in terms of continuous ( gaussian ) variables in optical experiments @xcite .",
    "as quantified by m.  reid  @xcite , a necessary condition for epr entanglement is that at least one quadrature field of one system can be inferred through a measurement of the same quadrature at the other system , with a precision that is smaller than the single - system ground state uncertainty .",
    "the epr paradox can also be presented as schrdinger s ` steering effect ' @xcite as discussed in @xcite and graphically described in @xcite .",
    "epr - entangled states having gaussian quantum statistics are also called ` two - mode - squeezed states ' .",
    "their wigner function is positive , but they belong to the class of ` nonclassical states ' because their p - function @xcite can not be interpreted as a classical mixture of coherent states @xcite .",
    "this section discusses the realization of an epr - entangled state of motion of two closely located pendulum - suspended mirrors of 0.1 kg , building on earlier work in the context of gravitational - wave detectors  @xcite .",
    "the physical concepts for the generation of the epr entangled motion of these two mirrors are described , as well as requirements on classical noise reduction , and entanglement verification .",
    "let us consider a michelson interferometer having two end mirrors that are individually suspended as pendula , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:michelsonsketch ] . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let the pendulum motions initially be in their quantum ground states .",
    "monochromatic , continuous - wave laser light in a coherent state is injected into one input port , splits at a balanced beam splitter , travels along the arms , is retro - reflected and perfectly overlaps at the beam splitter .",
    "the differential arm length is such that all light is retro - reflected towards the light source , while the second interferometer output port is thus at a dark fringe .",
    "the quantum states of the electro - magnetic fields leaving the two interferometer ports are sent to balanced homodyne detectors performing ideal measurements of one field quadrature at a time .",
    "the measurement at the dark port provides information about the differential mode of mirror motion ; the one at the bright port provides information about the common mode of mirror motion .",
    "the homodyne angles constitute parameters to optimize the information transfer about either the joint mirror position or the joint mirror momentum , or a linear combination of the two .",
    "generally , any such measurement provides information about both mechanical observables .",
    "the momentum is deduced from the difference of two subsequent position values .",
    "note , that a michelson interferometer is the natural setup for the generation of epr entangled mirror motion , since the two output ports inherently provide information about the two joined quantities in inequality  ( [ eq : hup2 ] ) .        due to reflection of the light ,",
    "neither the motional quantum states of the pendula nor the light beams remain in their respective states , and instead the optical fields and the mechanical mirror motion become coupled , in the following way .",
    "when light in one interferometer arm is reflected from the mirror , its phase at the beam splitter is first influenced by the position of the mirror .",
    "in addition , the time derivative of the phase at the beam splitter is influenced by the momentum of the mirror .",
    "( note , that a change of the light s amplitude quadrature due to mirror momentum can be neglected , since the mirror speed is always much smaller than the speed of light . ) next , the reflection transfers momentum from the light to the mirror , which is called radiation pressure and which leads to an excitation of the motional mirror states , affecting both its position and momentum .",
    "since the light s amplitude and phase quadratures , as well as the mirror s position and momentum , have quantum uncertainties , the coupling leads to entanglement between the reflected light and the mirror motion , which can be observed if the state s purity is sufficiently high @xcite .",
    "finally , the entanglement of the two light / mirror - systems has to be ` swapped ' to entanglement of the two mirrors , by detecting the interference results of the two light fields leaving the interferometer with balanced homodyne detectors @xcite .",
    "this detection simply provides information about how the initial systems are related to each other .",
    "entanglement is not destroyed because no measurement on individual systems is performed .",
    "for instance , one detector collects information about the differential mechanical phase quadrature , and the other detector collects information about the sum of the mechanical amplitude quadratures . both measurements",
    "are continuously performed using balanced homodyne detectors , and the recorded data streams are part of the verification process of the mirror entanglement .",
    "the simple michelson topology with two balanced homodyne detectors as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:michelsonsketch ] is in principle sufficient for the generation of entangled mirror motion . in practice , however , using the simple michelson interferometer is too demanding to provide a sufficiently low decoherence level .",
    "two different proposals were made to reduce the information loss to the environment .",
    "the first approach is putting an optical cavity with a long lifetime around the optomechanical system @xcite .",
    "the second approach is making sure that the majority of the information that leaves the optomechanical system is accessible and measured with appropriate detectors @xcite .",
    "similar to the procedure of entanglement swapping , this data stream then needs to be incorporated in the process of defining an optomechanical state , that is of high purity when ` conditioned ' on this data ( see further down ) .",
    "this work uses the second approach . in order to increase the photon radiation pressure coupling to the heavy mirrors ,",
    "optical cavities are also incorporated in the michelson interferometer .",
    "but here the lifetimes of the cavities are rather short to avoid a reduction of the information flow from the optomechanical system required for conditioning . in the system model",
    "the cavities can thus be adiabatically eliminated @xcite .",
    "as already used in the gravitational wave detector geo600 , retro - reflecting cavity mirrors in the two interferometer output ports are suitable to realize resonant light - power and signal enhancements , so - called ` power - recycling ' and ` signal - recycling ' @xcite .",
    "this work proposes a new interferometer topology for the generation of mirror entanglement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:michelson2 ] .",
    "each mirror constitutes the common end mirror of its own michelson interferometer .",
    "the two dark port output fields of the interferometers are overlapped at an additional balanced beam splitter and the two resulting fields sent to two balanced homodyne detectors .",
    "first of all , a feature of the proposed topology is that the two mirrors are placed close to each other , face to face , which might be essential for yet - to - be - defined tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics .",
    "this way , a system is realized in which the one - dimensional motions point along a common axis . in order to achieve a stable face to face operation point ,",
    "the proposed topology offers practical advantages compared to the version of the michelson interferometer that only has folded arms .",
    "since each mirror is the common end mirror of a michelson interferometer , the classical radiation pressure fluctuations , which are due to a fluctuating light power and which accelerate the mirrors centers of mass , cancel out .",
    "similarly , the effective dc radiation pressure force on the two mirrors also cancels out , which facilitates reaching the operational point of the interferometer when switching on the laser .",
    "perfect cancellation requires that both beams hit the mirror at precisely opposite sides .",
    "experimentally this is achieved by using light that is transmitted through the mirror and by maximizing the interference contrast between transmitted and reflected light @xcite .",
    "more information about the proposed mirror properties is given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig3:michelson2 ] .",
    "another important practical advantage of the new topology is that both output fields are ` dark ' , i.e. , in case of perfect interference contrast , completely free from any carrier light and thus free from laser noise .",
    "( in reality , the contrast will not be perfect ; the interferometers will also have unequal arm lengths , and it will be necessary to stabilize laser light power and frequency to some degree . ) furthermore , since the output fields are dim , they can be easily tomographically analysed by conventional balanced homodyne detectors .",
    "in contrast , the analysis of _ bright _ fields with such detectors is demanding since they require a local oscillator power that exceeds the signal beam power by much more than an order of magnitude ; and homodyne detectors use pin photodiodes , which can only handle powers of up to 100 mw at best .    ) in such a way that the quantum noise is correlated in both interferometer arms .",

    "a ) : further modes that enter the pbs are either orthogonally polarised or leave the setup towards the left .",
    "( b ) : quantum noise that enters the open port of the first beam splitter is eventually retro - reflected or reflected towards the left .",
    ", width=241 ]    another interesting feature of the proposed topology is that , in general , it not only allows for measurements on the _ joint _ but also on the _ individual _ mirror motions . in this case",

    "[ fig3:michelson2 ] needs to be bypassed .",
    "further down an interferometric method to realize fast switching between the bypass and no - bypass conditions is discussed .",
    "in contrast to previously proposed entanglement verification schemes , the possibility of individual mirror quantum state tomography might open a straight - forward way of verifying motional entanglement .",
    "although the new interferometer topology is quite different from a single , cavity - enhanced michelson interferometer considered in previous works , its photon radiation pressure noise is described by the same equation , and the observables measured by the two balanced homodyne detectors are not changed . in particular ,",

    "[ fig4:topology2 ] illustrates the equivalence of the single michelson interferometer and the topology of the proposed topology in terms of quantum measurement noise and quantum back - action noise , which are both given by the overall light power used to sense the mirror motions , and the relevant ports of the topology .",
