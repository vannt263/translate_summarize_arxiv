    "* measuring metallicities : * at the redshift of the galaxies in our sample ( @xmath29 ) , five prominent rest - frame optical emission lines are observable in the h+k sinfoni grism : [ oii]@xmath103727 and [ neiii]@xmath103870 in the h band , h@xmath7 , [ oiii]@xmath104959 and [ oiii]@xmath105007 in the k band .",
    "the resulting line ratios allow us to measure the gas phase metallicity using five well calibrated ^15^ diagnostics , @xmath30 = ( [ oii]@xmath103727 + [ oiii]@xmath104959 + [ oiii]@xmath105007)/h@xmath7 @xcite , [ oiii]@xmath105007/h@xmath7 , [ oii]@xmath103727/h@xmath7 , [ oiii]@xmath105007/[oii]@xmath103727 and [ neiii]@xmath103870/[oii]@xmath103727 . although these calibrations were obtained in local galaxies , where the physical conditions , such as the ionization parameter , might be different respect to higher redshift @xcite , these strong line metallicity diagnostics do not deviate at high - z more than about 0.1 dex @xcite .",
    "these calibrations only apply if the ionizing source is stellar radiation , while the presence of an agn ionizing continuum would invalidate the calibrations derived for star - forming galaxies .",
    "this could be a problem for our sources , as the larger metallicity differences are detected close to the galaxy nucleus , where an eventual agn contribution would be more important .",
    "we therefore checked that , for our galaxies , rest frame uv spectra , soft and hard x - ray data , as well as @xmath31 spitzer data show no indication of agn ^9^. moreover , we verified with spectral classification diagrams @xcite that the line ratios detected in the central nuclear regions of our sources are compatible with a pure starburst in a low metallicity galaxy , ruling out the presence of any agn contribution to the detected gradients , or significantly different physical conditions in the star forming regions with respect to local galaxies .",
    "obviously , not all of the five diagnostics listed above are independent , and each has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "[ oiii]@xmath105007/h@xmath7 is essentially unaffected by dust extinction , but it allows two different metallicities for a given ratio ( see fig .  [ exfit ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "[ oiii]@xmath105007/[oii]@xmath103727 has a monotonic dependence on metallicity , but it is affected by reddening .",
    "[ neiii]@xmath103870/[oii]@xmath103727 is instead both monotonic and less affected by dust , but the [ neiii]@xmath103870 line is much fainter than the others , and thus not always observable .",
    "however , the combination of these three indicators allows to measure unambiguously the metallicity , taking into account the effect of dust reddening ( see fig .",
    "[ figrat ] ) .",
    "we exclude the remaining two line ratios from the following analysis , as @xmath30 is very similar to [ oiii]@xmath105007/h@xmath7 at low metallicities and [ oii]@xmath103727/h@xmath7 is not independent from the others .    for each spatial pixel of the datacube with @xmath32 in [ oiii]@xmath105007/h@xmath7 , we determine the best combination of metallicity and extinction that minimizes the @xmath33 in the three selected diagnostics , after a gaussian smoothing of the data with a fwhm=3 pixels ( @xmath34 , lower than the spatial resolution of @xmath35 ) . to compute the @xmath33",
    ", we take into account both the uncertainties on the line ratio measurements and the dispersion of each calibration ^15^ such a dispersion is mostly due to the broad range of ionization parameters in the galaxies used to derive the calibrations^15^. there is no indication that the metallicity calibrations and the spread based on local galaxies may fail at high redshift , because the measured line ratios for our galaxies are consistent with the ones measured in local galaxies , and the comparison with the photoionization models available do not support the presence of unusually high ionization parameters . the spread in the calibrations results in a large uncertainty when the metallicity is measured using a single line ratio ( @xmath18 dex or more , depending on the line ratio ) , but the combination of the three independent tracers helps us to decrease the formal uncertainty ( see fig .  [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "the additional systematic uncertainty on the _ absolute _ metallicity associated with the photoionization models used to derived the calibrations is not considered , as we are only interested in relative metallicity differences .",
    "the fitting results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figrat ] for the three galaxies .    to quantify the significance of the detected gradients we extracted 1d spectra integrated over circular apertures within a diameter of @xmath36 , comparable to the psf .",
    "we selected two apertures in each galaxy , one centered on the lowest metallicity region and one with highest metallicity , and we used the resulting line ratios to derive the metallicities in both regions .",
    "the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ exfit ] for the three galaxies , and the results are listed in tab .  1 .",

    "<S> we selected these three galaxies because they show a remarkably symmetric velocity field in the [ oiii ] emission line , which traces the ionized gas kinematics ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the measured gas phase abundance variations have a significance between 98% and 99.8% ( see tab .  [ properties ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed line ratios depend on metallicity both directly and indirectly through the ionization parameter @xmath17 ( the ratio between the flux of ionizing photons and the gas density ) , with lower metallicity star forming regions generally have higher u @xcite . in principle , the observed variation of line ratios across galaxies could still be due to variations of @xmath17 unrelated to the metallicity distribution . as local galaxies show a broad range of ionization parameter , </S>",
    "<S> this dependence on u is responsible for the spread included in our calibrations . in order to exclude the possibility that the line ratios in our galaxies are biased due to significantly different values of ionization parameter at high redshift </S>",
    "<S> , we have examined their dependence on @xmath17 based on the latest photoionization models available @xcite @xcite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models are not able to simultaneously reproduce the different observed line ratios with a variation of the ionization parameter alone : at constant metallicity the observed line ratios differ from models predictions by @xmath18 dex . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrate that different metallicities are required to reproduce the observations , and even if other effects are present , they are not dominant .    observed metallicity gradients in local disk galaxies show metallicities decreasing outward from the galactic centers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our high redshift sources show `` inverted '' gradients , with lower metallicity in a well defined active region closer to the galaxy center . </S>",
    "<S> current models of chemical enrichment in galaxies @xcite @xcite can not reproduce our observations at the moment , as they assume radially isotropic gas accretion onto the disk and the instantaneous recycling approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the detected gradients can be explained in the framework of the cold gas accretion scenario @xcite recently proposed to explain the properties of gas rich , rotationally supported galaxies observed at high redshift @xcite @xcite . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the observed low metallicity regions are created by the local accretion of metal - poor gas in clumpy streams @xcite ; this gas penetrate deep into the galaxy following the potential well , and sustaining the observed high star formation rate in the pre - enriched disk . </S>",
    "<S> stream - driven turbulence is then responsible for the fragmentation of the disks into giant clumps , as observed at @xmath19 @xcite @xcite , that are the sites of efficient star formation and possibly the progenitors of the central spheroid . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is also in agreement with the dynamical properties of our galaxies , which appear to be dominated by gas rotation in a disk with no evidence of the kinematical asymmetries typically induced by mergers .    if infall and outflows are not present , metallicity is directly related to the fraction of gas present in the galaxy . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> additional hints on the presence of infall and outflows can be obtained considering these two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we can derive an estimate of gas fractions in each single region of our galaxies assuming that the relation between sfr and gas density observed in the local universe ( the schmidt - kennicutt relation @xcite ) also applies to high redshift galaxies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gas fractions obtained for the two regions in each galaxy are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figyields ] plotted againts metallicities @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that our results do not support the closed box model ( black line ) where galaxies have no contribution from infalls and outflows . </S>",
    "<S> our data can be reproduced only by including either outflows of very enriched material , such as the ejecta from sne , which extract metals and decrease @xmath20 , or infalls of pristine gas which increase the gas fraction and decrease @xmath20 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if strong infall of pristine gas is present , we would expect higher gas fractions in the low metallicity regions , as observed . </S>",
    "<S> using simple models@xcite@xcite , we estimate the amount of infall and outflow required to reproduce the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account two opposite scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> if inflows are dominant , we require @xmath21 times more pristine gas infall in the low metallicity regions than in the high metallicity part . on the other hand , if outflows are dominant , high metallicity regions can be explained with outflow @xmath22 times the sfr , while unrealistic outflows @xmath23 times the sfr would be needed to explain the properties of low metallicity regions . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the differences in gas fractions as derived by our estimates are not only reasonable given the measured metallicity differences , but are also consistent with expectations from massive infalls of low metallicity gas in the central regions of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> they are unlikely to be explained using outflows only .    </S>",
    "<S> our observations of low metallicity regions in three galaxies at @xmath24 therefore provide the evidence for the actual presence of accretion of metal - poor gas in massive high - z galaxies , capable to sustain high star formation rates without frequent mergers of already evolved and enriched sub - units . </S>",
    "<S> this picture was already indirectly suggested by recent observational studies of gas rich disks at @xmath25@xcite@xcite , by the study of the variation of metallicity as a function of gas fraction @xcite and star formation rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented here are now directly revealing the metal poor accreted gas responsible for fueling the star formation rate in massive galaxies in the early universe .    </S>",
    "<S> although the three galaxies discussed here are the only @xmath24 sources for which a metallicity gradient has been measured at the moment , the detection of lower metallicity clouds in all three galaxies suggests that metal poor gas accretion is probably a common feature in actively rotationally supported star forming galaxies at this early cosmic epoch . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is hard to speculate how much this accretion mechanism is dominant in the global star forming population , as the relative number of rotationally supported and more dynamically complex galaxies is still unknown , and similar observations are still missing in different classes of galaxies .    1 dekel , a. , et al . , cold streams in early massive hot haloes as the main mode of galaxy formation , nature , * 457 * , 451 - 454 ( 2009 ) bournaud , f. , & elmegreen , b.  g. , unstable disks at high redshift : evidence for smooth accretion in galaxy formation , astrophys . j. lett . , * </S>",
