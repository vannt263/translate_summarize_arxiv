    "hard x - rays ( @xmath3 10 kev ) are able to penetrate this zone thereby providing a `` window '' that is virtually free of obscuration not only relative to optical wavelengths but also partly in comparison to soft x - ray observations . unfortunately the hard x - ray band is still poorly explored and the only truly all - sky survey conducted so far dates back to the 1980 s ( levine et al . 1984 ) .",
    "this pioneering work , made with the _ heao1_-a4 instrument yielded a catalogue of about 70 sources down to a flux level of typically 1/75 of the crab ( or 2 - 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ) in the 13 - 80 kev band .",
    "only 7 extragalactic objects are reported in the a4 survey : none of these objects is within 10@xmath1 of the galactic plane and only two ( centaurus a and the perseus cluster ) are located below 20@xmath1 in galactic latitude .",

    "bepposax_/pds have unveiled more sources but observations were sometimes limited by the lack of imaging capability of the instrument which is particularly crucial in the galactic plane region . a step forward in the study of the zone of avoidance is possible with the imager on board _ integral _ , which allows detection with a sensitivity up to a few mcrab in the most exposed regions ( i.e. the galactic center ) and provides an angular resolution of 12 and a point source location accuracy of 2 - 3. here we present a compendium of the extragalactic results obtained so far within the first year of the _ integral _ core programme .",
    "the ibis coded mask instrument ( ubertini et al . 2003 ) on board _ integral _ ( winkler et al . 2003 ) comprises two detection layers : isgri , an upper cdte detector sensitive in the range 15 kev to 1 mev and picsit , a bottom csi detector sensitive in the range 200 kev to 8 mev ; herein we refer only to data collected by the first layer .",
    "the data analysed here belong to the core programme , i.e. were collected as part of the _ integral _ galactic plane survey and galactic centre deep exposure ( winkler et al .",
    "2003 ) and are the just return to the instrument teams involved in the project . the data utilized for this work span from orbit 20 to orbit 145 inclusive .",
    "the total observation time varies from region to region in the sky and ranges from 0.8 ms in the galactic center region which is the most exposed to typically 0.05 ms in some parts of the galactic plane ; some regions such as those of cygnus , crab and vela are more exposed than a standard galactic plane region . during the 72 hours of the satellite s orbital period ( i.e. an _ integral _ revolution ) observations are performed as a series of fixed pointings that last about 37 minutes each and between which the satellite adjusts its position for the next pointing .",
    "the data collected during one such pointing are pre - processed and stored as one science window ( scw ) ; typically there are 110 scw in an orbit .",
    "data reduction was performed with the osa 3 _ integral _ science data center analysis software ( goldwurm et al 2003 ) , this version of the analysis procedures and calibration files is providing clean images although some systematic effects are still present . briefly , image reconstruction is performed as follows : from the event list for one scw , a subset of events is selected according to given energy bands .",
    "this subset is then used to build a detector image or shadowgram from which a background map is subtracted .",
    "convolution of the shadowgram with a decoding array provides the reconstructed sky image containing not only the main peak of all sources located within the field of view but also their secondary lobes ( i.e. ghosts ) .",
    "the final reconstructed sky image is obtained after each source is identified and its secondary lobes subtracted .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each energy band and each scw ; the data of many scw can then be mosaicked to obtain for each portion of the sky the total exposure available . for our search of active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "we choose to search the 20 - 100 kev band as this provides a good combination between sensitivity and overall background level over the entire = 1.9 and a break around 100 kev ( malizia et al .",
    "2003 ) so that our choice of energy band perfectly matches these spectral characteristics . using the data analysis procedure described above we sampled the whole sky by means of 40 ( mosaicked ) pointings which allow the full coverage of our galaxy : see figure 1 where circles have 10@xmath8 radius to roughly match the half coded field of view of isgri ;",
    "note that the top and bottom parts of the plane were also covered although not at the full instrument sensitivity .",
    "we then proceeded with the identification of all excesses ( above 6 sigma confidence level ) visible in the images in order to extract the detected extragalactic objects ; identification of these excesses has been performed by cross checking the isgri error boxes ( typically 2 - 3 arcmin ) with the simbad / ned and heasarc data bases .",

    "some of these detections are expected to be known sources already observed by previous x - ray satellites but a number may be new hard x - ray objects .",
    "analysis of the entire data set provides a list of 10 agn plus one cluster of galaxies detected by ibis / isgri in the 20 - 100 kev band : for each object table 1 reports the source name , redshift , class , number of detected sigma and science windows used in the analysis . here",
    "we present some highlights of this work , while a more detailed study of each individual source is postponed to dedicated papers .",
    "the first interesting result arising from table 1 is the ratio between type 2 ( i.e. objects with the broad line region ( brl ) hidden behind gas and dust ) versus type 1 objects ( i.e. those with a visible blr ) : we find a ratio of 7 to 2 , which is interestingly close to the value found in optical spectroscopic surveys ( maiolino and rieke ( 1995 ) and ho et al .",

    "this situation has only recently been appreciated due to the fact that previous observations above 10 kev of two of the above objects were not available and also perhaps due to ngc4945 being a starburst at most wavebands and circinus lying too close to the galactic plane .",

    "if we assume that agn have randomly oriented viewing angles , the ratio of type 1 to 2 objects is related to @xmath12 the half opening angle of the obscuring torus , via the relation n1/n1+n2=(1-cos@xmath12 , where n1 and n2 are the number of type 1 and 2 objects ) . from our ratio",
