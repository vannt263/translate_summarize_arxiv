    "in this work , we attempt to relate generalized statistical theories to correlated electron or quasiparticle systems which , since 1980 s , have been subjected to intensive theoretical and experimental studies due to their important roles in optical@xcite , mechanical@xcite , electric and magnetic @xcite properties of metal compounds with partially filled d- or f - electrons . in general , with complex correlations , the conventional boltzmann - gibbs statistics ( bgs ) for free fermions is no longer valid .",
    "most of the theoretical study up to now was numerical simulations based on approximate models including essential physics of the systems of interest .",
    "although these theoretical works are very important and fruitful , the need of general understanding and theoretical formulation of the distribution laws begins to be felt . due to the complexity of the correlations",
    ", we can conjecture that generalization of fermi - dirac ( fd ) theory may be useful . in this sense",
    ", some efforts have been made to understand localized electron behavior on the basis of fractal geometry ( see @xcite and references there - in ) , a generalization of normal space - time .    in what follows ,",
    "i present a work in this direction based , not on the fractal or chaotic assumption , but on generalized statistical theories proposed for complex systems showing correlated phenomena .",
    "the theoretical results will be compared to numerical and experimental ones for correlated electrons .",
    "it is expected that this attempt can help to better understand different generalized theories and identify valid theories for this special circumstance .",
    "indeed , in the last decade , bgs theory has experienced a turbulent period with the rapid development of some anomalous theories to treat complex systems .",
    "these theories are anomalous in the sense that they may perturb our old conceptions concerning , e.g. , information , energy , quantum states , additivity etc .",
    "the main characters of these theories can be resumed as follows :    \\1 ) consideration of nonadditivity in entropy , energy , quantum occupation number etc . depending on empirical parameters ,",
    "e.g. @xmath0 in tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics ( nsm)@xcite and in its incomplete statistics ( is ) version@xcite as well as in quantum group theory ( qgt)@xcite , @xmath1 in @xmath2-statistics ( ks)@xcite .",
    "\\2 ) bosonization of fermions or fermionization of bosons allowing intermediate occupation number related to empirical parameter , e.g. @xmath3 in fractional exclusion statistics(fes)@xcite and @xmath4 for the fes in the frame of ks@xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the empirical parameters take some particular values when the theories recover bgs ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the philosophy of these generalizations , explicit or not , is to introduce empirical parameters to  absorb \" the effects of complex correlations .",
    "so interacting systems can be mathematically treated as noninteracting or conventional ones .",
    "for example , the total energy of an interacting  free particle \" can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the momentum and @xmath11 the mass of the particle .",
    "the extra interaction energy is in this way  absorbed \" in the empirical parameter when they are different from the values corresponding to conventional cases .    about the generalization of fd statistics , figure 1",
    "shows the different fermion distributions at @xmath12=100 k of the generalized statistical mechanics mentioned above .",
    "we see that the discontinuity in occupation number @xmath13 at fermi energy @xmath14 depends almost only on temperature for all these distributions .",
    "the sharp @xmath13-drop hardly changes for whatever value of the empirical parameters .",
    "in addition , we note that the approximate distribution ( ad ) @xmath15^{1/(q-1)}+1}$ ] ( @xmath16 in order that the inverse temperature @xmath17 can go to @xmath18 ) of nsm obtained with factorization approximation@xcite by neglecting correlation energy between the particles is only slightly different from fd one .",
    "so its fermi energy is almost identical to that of fd .",
    "the situation of ks is similar . at low temperature ,",
    "the @xmath2-distribution of standard fermion ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20^{1/\\kappa}+1}$]@xcite is hardly different from fd for @xmath2 values which give finite internal energy ( e.g. @xmath21 for two dimensional fermion gas ) . for fes fermion distribution @xmath22@xcite ( or equivalently @xmath23@xcite ) , the @xmath13-discontinuity depends only on temperature just as for fd .",
    "the influence of @xmath24 smaller than unity ( for fd ) is to decrease @xmath14 ( @xmath24 times ) and to increase the maximal occupation number ( @xmath25 ) . as for the nonextensive fermion distribution of",
    "is @xmath15^{q/(q-1)}+1}$]@xcite , though @xmath13 drop at @xmath14 is always very sharp , @xmath14 increase considerably as @xmath26 decreases from unity . and",
    "consequently , there is an important wide @xmath13 decrease with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that , for @xmath27 , @xmath14 can increase up to two times the @xmath14 of fd with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for all energy below ( above ) @xmath14 .",
    "another common character of nsm and is distributions is that , due to the energy cutoff with @xmath30 , there are few electrons above @xmath14 at low temperature ( large @xmath17 ) .",
    "now let see the distributions of correlated electrons . from some results of experiments and numerical simulations based on low dimension kondo lattice models ( klm)@xcite , we notice two important effects of correlations .",
    "first , the wide decrease of @xmath13 and the sharp @xmath13 drop at @xmath14 much larger than that without correlation have indeed been observed for very strongly correlated electrons ( with the coupling parameter @xmath31)@xcite ( see figure 3 and 4 ) .",
    "so it is possible to describe correlated electron systems in strong coupling regime by is fermion distribution with @xmath26 very smaller than unity ( close to zero)@xcite . on the other hand , another effect of correlation , in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "is the flattening of @xmath13 drop at @xmath14@xcite .",
    "that is that the correlation , even at low temperature , drives electrons above @xmath14 so that the @xmath13 discontinuity becomes less and less sharp as the correlation increases .",
    "curiously , this flattening of @xmath13 discontinuity at @xmath14 , though confirmed by experimental results@xcite , is completely absent in the fermion distributions given by all the statistics , extensive ( fes ) or nonextensive ( nsm , is and ks ) , mentioned above .",
    "fermi surface plays an essential role in the physical properties of metals and metal compounds .",
    "so it is of great interest for generalized statistical theories to take into account the essential physics relevant to fermi energy . in what follows",
    ", we will show that it is possible to cover the observed weak correlation effects upon @xmath14 within an additive generalization of bgs based on the is principles .",
    "the reader can find a complete review of is theory in references @xcite .",
    "the concept of is is inspired by incomplete probability distribution ( i.e. @xmath32)@xcite as well as the theoretical difficulties one encounters with @xmath33 in nsm@xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of is is that our knowledge about physical systems is in general incomplete due to unknown interactions or their effects which can not be studied explicitly . in this case , there are always missing informations about the physical systems .",
    "so probability distribution is in general inexact and incomplete and can not sum to one .",
    "one should write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is certain function to be determined . in the case of complete or approximately complete distribution ( such as bgs ) , @xmath35 is identity function . in my previous paper , in order to keep tsallis framework of nsm , i proposed @xmath36 so that @xmath37 where @xmath26 is tsallis entropy index@xcite",
    ". since @xmath38 , we have to set @xmath39 $ ] . when @xmath5 , @xmath40 becomes complete , which implies a complete or quasi - complete knowledge about the system of interest .",
    "the nonextensive is formalism@xcite on the basis of tsallis entropy yields tsallis @xmath26-exponential distributions and the fermion distribution@xcite discussed above .",
    "an successful application of eq.([2 ] ) to the study of some power laws on the basis of rnyi entropy@xcite can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "one can even find a plausible justification of eq.([2 ] ) in a work of tsallis on the probability distribution on some simple fractal supports like koch or cantor sets@xcite .",
    "indeed , the phase space of the systems including complex interactions is in general chaotic or fractal structure . in these structures ,",
    "exact probability distribution is impossible due to the fact that , first , the structures are not differentiable and integrable , second , as mentioned above , some state points in the structures are not accessible .",
    "so the treatment of the incomplete distributions , not in the fractal space of @xmath41 dimension , but in a differentiable and integrable @xmath42-dimension space , is inevitable .",
    "this consideration yields in a natural way the incomplete normalization eq.([2])@xcite .",
    "now we suppose that the system of interest has additive information and physical quantities ( e.g. @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hamiltonian of the compound system and @xmath45 that of the @xmath46 subsystem ) .",
    "this case may happen if there are only weak and short range interactions , so that the hartley formula @xmath47 for information measure should apply .",
    "the entropy of the system can be defined  la shannon as follows@xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 obviously becomes gibbs - shannon entropy ( @xmath50 ) when @xmath5 , which identifies @xmath51 to boltzmann constant .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath49 verifies all the properties of @xmath50 . for _ microcanonical ensemble _ ( @xmath52 ) , we have @xmath53 which decreases with increasing @xmath26 value . in general , @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) if @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) .    for _ canonical ensemble _",
    ", we postulate @xmath58 where @xmath44 is the hamiltonian and @xmath59 the internal energy of the system .",
    "the maximum entropy of @xmath49 with eq.([2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) as constraints leads to : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the lagrange parameter @xmath17 can be determined by @xmath62 where @xmath12 is the absolute temperature .",
    "it is easy to see that all thermodynamic relations in this theory are identical to those in bgs .",
    "we indicate in passing that this generalization of bgs is obviously the consequence of the  power - normalization \" eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "other useful normalizations , if any , of incomplete distributions may lead to different generalization of bgs . for example , if we use hartley formula as information measure and define expectation value for additive entropy and energy with @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an empirical parameter , maximum entropy will lead to the famous _ stretched exponential distribution_@xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is positive energy of the system at state @xmath68 , @xmath24 and @xmath17 the lagrange multipliers related respectively to normalization and energy constraint @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 , we can recover @xmath71 as in bgs .",
    "for _ grand canonical ensemble _ , the same machinery as above leads to @xmath72 with @xmath73^{1/q}$ ] . supposing @xmath74 and @xmath75 in accordance with the additivity assumption , the average occupation number @xmath13 of one - particle state of energy @xmath76 can be straightforwardly calculated@xcite :    @xmath77    which recovers fd distribution for @xmath5 .",
    "the fermi energy can be calculated in the standard way . for 2-d systems ,",
    "e.g. , we have @xmath78 . in figure 2",
    "is plotted the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath14 for different @xmath26 values for 1-d fermion systems .",
    "we see that @xmath14 considerably changes with decreasing @xmath26 . from eq.([12 ] ) , we see that @xmath26-dependence of @xmath14 at given @xmath12 will be similar to the @xmath12-dependence . the effect of @xmath26 on other physical quantities ( specific heat , electrical conductivity , susceptibility , effective mass etc . )",
    "is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 distribution around the fermi momentum @xmath79 can be estimated from eq.([12 ] ) using @xmath80 .",
    "we get : @xmath81\\ ] ] which is similar to the analog given by a monte - carlo calculation based on a tight - binding kondo lattice ( @xmath82)@xcite . a comparison with @xcite leads to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the quasiparticle weight of photoemission spectrum .",
    "note that @xmath84 is @xmath79-dependent here .",
    "eq.([14 ] ) tells us that decreasing @xmath26 yields a flattening of @xmath13 drop at @xmath14 .    in figure 3 and 4",
    ", we compare the momentum distribution given by eq.([12 ] ) for @xmath12=50 k to some numerical results of the momentum distribution of 1-d correlated electrons@xcite .",
    "we see that , for about @xmath85 and @xmath86 , klm calculations can be well reproduced by eq.([12 ] ) .",
    "but for smaller @xmath26 or stronger coupling with @xmath87 , a long tail in the klm distributions begins to develop at high energy and can not be reproduced by eq.([12 ] ) . at the same time , a new fermi surface at @xmath88 starts to appear and a sharp @xmath13 drop ( energy cutoff ) takes place at the new fermi momentum .",
    "all these strong correlation effects turn out to be completely absent within the present is fermion distribution .",
    "it is clear that this discrepancy marks the limit of this formalism and perhaps implies that nonextensivity is no more negligible in very strong - coupling case .",
    "it is worth noticing that the strong correlation effects , absent in additive is fermion distribution , are just what we noted in nonextensive is fermion distribution@xcite plotted in figure 1 .",
    "this suggests that a combination of these two is generalizations of bgs , representing respectively two different aspect of correlation , may be an interesting approach leading to more generally valid statistical mechanics suitable for correlated particle systems .",
    "we have compared several important generalizations of fd distribution to numerical and experimental results for correlated electron systems .",
    "it is found that the generalized fermion distributions based on incomplete information can be useful for describing these systems .",
    "it is shown that the extensive is fermion distribution gives a good description of correlated electrons in weak coupling regime .",
    "on the other hand , it fails to describe strongly correlated conduction electrons and localized @xmath89-electrons which are possible to be described by the nonextensive is fermion distribution .",
    "the latter , though powerless for the description of weakly correlated electrons , shows similar behavior as the heavy electrons in strong coupling regime : strong increase of @xmath14 and @xmath13-cutoff accompanied by a general decrease in @xmath13 at all energy up to @xmath14 . in a current work",
