    "the first systematic study , based on optical spectroscopy , of a complete and well defined sample of broad line agn was conducted by boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "it included 87 @xmath12 agn from the bright quasar survey ( bqs , green et al .",
    "1986 ) , with spectra taken over the 41005900  range , at a spectral resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "this survey , and additional systematic studies at other wavelengths , led to major new understandings of the emission and absorption properties of agn ( bg92 , and citations thereafter ) .",
    "the bqs survey was followed by the large bright quasar survey , which yielded spectra of 1055 quasars ( hewett et al .",
    "1995 ) , and by the 2df qso redshift survey which yielded spectra for 23338 quasars ( croom et al .",
    "the next major step in agn optical spectroscopy came with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalog ( latest release qcv , schneider et al . 2010 ) , which produced a sample of quasars a factor of 1000 larger , compared to bg92 , with a factor of 10 more spectroscopic data per object ( a factor of three larger wavelength coverage and a factor of three larger spectral resolution ) .",
    "this sample is now a prime resource for studies of agn ( see schneider et al . 2002 , and citations thereafter ) .",
    "the qcv sample is mainly based on objects selected for spectroscopy due to their non - stellar colours , supplemented by sdss spectra selected based on other surveys .",
    "the qcv sample includes luminous objects ( @xmath14 ) which exhibit at least one emission line with fwhm @xmath15 .",
    "various studies used the sdss to produce samples of lower luminosity agn . at @xmath16 the agn are generally dominated by the host light , which needs to be subtracted to detect the agn continuum and broad line emission .",
    "hao et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , who used the sdss second data release ( dr2 ) , subtracted the host light based on a principal component analysis method .",
    "they then modeled the  profile using one or two gaussians , and derived the fwhm of the broader component .",
    "their type 1 agn sample includes a total of 1317 objects with fwhm @xmath17 1200  @xmath18 , and was used to study the extension of the luminosity function of type 1 agn to low luminosities .",
    "the later study of vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based on dr3 , extended the earlier sdss quasar sample ( schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) to lower luminosity by removing the absolute magnitude criterion , which yielded 4666 low - luminosity type 1 agn , used to study the relation between the agn luminosity and the host properties . the definition of a type 1 agn in vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and also in qcv , requires the detection of at least one emission line with fwhm @xmath19 .",
    "this criterion works well for luminous agn , as the emission line width is dominated by the broad line region ( blr ) in type 1 agn , and it excludes type 2 agn where the emission lines are from the narrow line region ( nlr ) , where the fwhm @xmath20 .",
    "however , as we show below lower luminosity type 1 agn show an increasing relative contribution from the nlr , and would fail the fwhm @xmath15 criterion .",
    "thus , the vanden berk et al . ( 2006 ) sample becomes increasingly incomplete with decreasing agn luminosity .",
    "the latest sdss sample of low luminosity type 1 agn is of green & ho ( 2007 , hereafter gh07 ) , which is based on dr4 .",
    "this sample is based on the detection of a broad component for the  emission line in the @xmath21 wavelength region .",
    "it includes 8435 objects , and was used to study the agn black hole mass ( @xmath10 ) function .",
    "we note that broad  with fwhm @xmath22 are selected against in the gh07 sample . due to their restricted search region .    here",
    "we present a new sdss based sample of type 1 agn which extends to low luminosity , with the purpose of providing a useful and well defined database which extends the qcv sample to low luminosity , using dr7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "we combine this data set with observations in the uv , ir , and x - ray , based on galex ( martin et al . 2005 ) , 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and rosat ( voges et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) , in order to study the nir to x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of low luminosity agn , and its dependence on various agn properties .",
    "we also derive the mean properties of low luminosity agn host galaxies , and compare them to the mean properties of inactive galaxies . in following papers",
    "we study some of the emission line properties of this sample .",
    "the first study of the ir to x - ray sed of a complete and well defined sample of agn was made by sanders et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for the bqs optically selected quasar sample .",
    "it showed the overall similarity of the sed of agn , composed of an ir bump , an optical - uv bump , and an x - ray power - law continuum .",
    "a follow up study was made by richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for a small subsample of 259 quasars from the sdss , which determined the wavelength dependence of the bolometric correction factor .",
    "however , little is known about the dependence of the agn sed on luminosity , @xmath10 , and luminosity in eddington units @xmath11 ( vasudevan & fabian 2009 ; grupe et al .",
    "this dependence may provide important clues to the nature of the accretion process ( e.g. davis & laor 2011 ) .    here",
    "we provide an order of magnitude larger sample of type 1 agn with nearly complete detections in most bands .",
    "these allow us to form an unbiased sed of the sample which extends to low luminosity agn , and to study its relation with various agn properties .",
    "a significant limitation is that the sed of low luminosity agn is often dominated by the host galaxy emission .",
    "high angular resolution , not available here , is required to isolate the low luminosity agn emission from the host galaxy light ( e.g. maoz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , we explore how broad the broad  gets .",
    "laor ( 2003 ) noted that type 1 agn with blr fwhm@xmath23 are extremely rare .",
    "various theoretical models of the blr and the ionizing continuum predict an upper limit on the fwhm , beyond which the blr does not exist ( nicastro 2000 , elitzur and shlosman 2006 , laor & davis 2011 ) .",
    "the models differ in the dependence of the maximal fwhm on luminosity . here",

    "our purpose is to derive a complete and well defined sample of low luminosity broad line agn , based on the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",

    "the 95% completeness limit in the @xmath5 band is 22.2 mag .",

    "the flux of the spectra is calibrated by matching the spectra of simultaneously observed standard stars to their psf magnitude ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) . on each spectrum , the sdss pipeline measures the emission lines , and then determines the redshift @xmath7 and the classification of the spectrum , according to the locations of emission lines , or according to correlations with template spectra .      1 .",

    "2002 ) which is no more than 0% , 20% or 50% , depending on the distance from  ( see appendix a1 ) .",
    "the main source of bad pixels is poor sky subtraction , which degrades the spectrum mainly at @xmath40 .",
    "a total of 232837  spectra , out of the 1.6 million spectra in dr7 , pass these five criteria . we dub them as the ` parent sample ' .",
    "the spectra are then corrected for foreground dust , using the maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "we now need to determine which of these objects host a broad line agn .",
    "the rather large 3   fibre aperture of the sdss spectra implies that a significant fraction of the host light is typically included , which needs to be removed in order to identify low luminosity agn . as discussed below (  2.3 ) , the agn are identified through the detection of a broad  component . to detect this component",
    "we need to subtract the broad stellar absorption features , and derive a smooth continuum .",
    "in particular , in the vicinity of the  feature , there are flanking  bands ( bica & alloin 1986 , and see appendix a2 ) , which need to be properly subtracted off .    to roughly model the absorption features",
    ", we follow an approach similar in principle to that described in hao et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "we utilize the galaxy eigenspectra ( esa ) presented in yip et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter yip04 ) , which were derived from a principle component analysis of sdss galaxies . a linear sum of the first three esa and a power law component with @xmath41 , representing the agn continuum , is fit to wavelength regions which lack the strongest galaxy and agn emission lines ( see appendix a2 ) .",
    "note that the four components of the fit are non - orthogonal , in contrast with the original esa of yip04 .    in practice ,",
    "light emitted by hot stars near  is degenerate with the power - law component , as can be seen in the third es of yip04 ( fig .",
    "5 there ) .",
    "this degeneracy produces an unrealistic result that the mean fraction of continuum emission emitted by agn in all galaxies is @xmath42 . in the more thorough pca decomposition performed by vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in which they use also eigenvectors derived from a sample of quasars , they found that host - agn separation is unreliable if the contribution of either component is @xmath43 .",
    "this problem probably also arises from the non - orthogonality of the base spectra , as we find here .",
    "note that if one excludes objects in which one of the components is weak , a correlation between the host and agn luminosity is introduced . to avoid these complications and uncertainties , we use our pca results only to subtract the stellar features and",
    "search for a broad , and not to derive the host and agn emission .",
    "the linear sum of the three esa is subtracted from the sdss spectra in the wavelength ranges 48005250  and 61257000 , to derive a featureless continuum near the ,  and  lines .",
    "note that the yip04 esa include narrow emission lines from  regions , with typical fwhm of @xmath44 , which should be avoided .",
    "we interpolate over all the strong narrow features in the esa prior to their subtraction ( note the narrow lines do not participate in the fit ) .",
    "since  in es 1 and 2 , and  in es 1 , reside in wider stellar absorption features ( fwhm @xmath45 ) , there may be additional narrower stellar absorption features , which are lost by the interpolation , and not properly subtracted off with the other stellar absorption features .",
    "the possible amplitude of this effect is small , and is discussed in following papers on the narrow emission line properties .    in 1% of the spectra in the parent sample",
    "only poor fits ( reduced @xmath46 ) are obtained . the algorithm described below",
    "might falsely detect a broad  feature when the fit is poor , and such false detections are filtered in the final stage of the pipeline (  2.5 ) .      a broad emission line is a unique signature of agn emission .",
    "we search for a broad  line , as  is the strongest agn line in the visible region .",
    "identifying agn through the detection of a broad  line is easier than the detection of a power - law component , as the average flux density of the broad  feature is @xmath47 times larger than the power - law continuum flux density ( fig .",
    "1 ) . also , as discussed above , the power - law component is degenerate with the continuum of young stars . to identify a broad  line we search for excess flux above the continuum in the vicinity of , which can not be attributed to be part of the narrow emission line profiles .",
    "after subtracting the stellar emission , the featureless continuum is derived by linearly interpolating the mean continuum level at the continuum windows at 61256250  and 68807000 , which are @xmath48 , or @xmath49 away from .",
    "the continuum is subtracted , and a broad  is looked for in the residual spectrum .",
    "the residual flux at 62506880  is summed , excluding regions 20-pixel wide ( 1380 @xmath18 ) centred on the , ,  and  narrow emission lines .",
    "also , we exclude excess flux detected away from , with a region at least ten pixels wide with null mean residual flux , as it is implausible that such distinct emission features originate from a broad  emission feature .",
    "bad pixels are interpolated over .",
    "the total excess flux is denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "the significance of @xmath50 is assessed by comparing it to @xmath51 , the dispersion in the flux density at 61256250  and 68807000 , which incorporates both the s / n of the spectrum and residual stellar features which were not fully subtracted in  2.2 .",
    "a total of 6986  ( 3% ) objects with @xmath52 , from the parent sample of 232837  objects , are found as potential broad - line agn , and were passed on to the next stage of the pipeline .",
    "a depiction of this process , and the reasoning behind the 2.5 threshold , appear in appendix a3 .",
    "the purpose of this stage is to fit the excess flux near  by a broad line profile .",
    "we measure the profiles of various forbidden lines ,  @xmath53 ,  @xmath54 ,  @xmath55 and  @xmath56 , which provide the narrow lines profile , and help us separate the broad and narrow components of .",
    "we use 4@xmath57-order gauss - hermite functions ( ghs ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) to fit the narrow line profiles , and an up to 10@xmath57-order gh to fit the broad  profile , which can have a complex shape , such as a double peak . the levenberg - marquardt best - fit algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) is used in all fits .",

    "an overview of the fitting process is given below , and further details appear in appendix a4 .",
    "the narrow line results are used in following papers , so a more elaborate analysis of their fit procedure and its implications is given there .",
    "the wavelength region near , 49675250 , is fit with three components : an iron template derived from observations of i  zw  1 ( kindly provided by t. boroson ) , a gh fit for the  line , and a continuum component .",
    "the iron template can broaden and shift during the fit . following that , all the lines between 62506880  noted above are fit , using a 4@xmath57-order gh for the broad . to lower the degrees of freedom ,",
    "the widths and higher moments of all the narrow lines in this region are kept equal . in the cases where all these narrow lines are too weak to significantly constrain their fit ( 14% of final sample ,",
    "see  2.5 ) , we tie their widths and higher moments to that of , which is detected in @xmath58 of the objects in the final sample .",
