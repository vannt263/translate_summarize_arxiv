    "we present systematic arpes data to reveal the bulk electronic structure of taas .",
    "our arpes data show that there are three pockets that cross the fermi level , namely , w1 weyl cones , w2 weyl cones and the trivial hole pockets .",
    "supplementary figure  [ arpes]*c * shows the arpes fermi surface on the @xmath96 mirror plane .",
    "we observe ring - shaped hole - like contours .",
    "these contours demonstrate the trivial hole pockets , consistent with the calculations ( supplementary figure  [ arpes]*c * ) . in supplementary figure  [ arpes]*d * , we show arpes measured @xmath97 fermi surface at the @xmath98 value that corresponds to the w2 weyl nodes . we observe that the fermi surface consists of discrete points , which are the w2 weyl nodes .",
    "the energy dispersion measurement in supplementary figure  [ arpes]*f * indeed reveals two cones , which are the two nearby w2 weyl cones .",
    "similarly , figs .",
    "[ arpes]*g - i * are data showing the w1 weyl cones and weyl nodes .",
    "we find that the energy of the w1 weyl node is about 10 - 20 mev lower than that of the w2 weyl node ( figs .",
    "[ arpes]*f , i * ) , in agreement with the calculation ( 13 mev ) .",
    "more precisely determining their energy difference is limited by the experimental energy resolution ( @xmath99 mev ) . because the @xmath3-space splitting of the w1 weyl nodes is much smaller than that of the w2 , resolving the two nearby w1 weyl cones is beyond the experimental resolution .",
    "we emphasize that our arpes data are important in the following aspects .",
    "first , our arpes data experimentally prove the existence of weyl fermions in our taas samples .",
    "second , they experimentally reveal that there are three kinds of pockets crossing the fermi level , w1 weyl cones , w2 weyl cones and the trivial hole bands .",
    "third , they experimentally determine the fermi energy , which is quite close to the w2 weyl nodes .",
    "thus w1 weyl cones contribute electron pockets and the trivial bands contribute hole pockets.the w2 weyl cones have small carrier density , and can be either electron - like or hole - like depending on the specific position of the fermi energy with respect to the w2 nodes .",
    "these observations are crucial for our transport measurements .",
    "we carried out magneto - transport and quantum oscillation measurements to determine the band parameters of the taas samples in our transport experiments . in figure",
    "[ sdh ] , we show the magneto - transport data on sample a1 as a representative example .",
    "same measurements were also performed on other samples presented in the main text in order to obtain their band parameters .",
    "figure  [ sdh]*a * shows the hall resistance @xmath100 of sample a1 at different temperatures , clearly revealing a coexistence of the electron and hole carriers .",
    "this is consistent with the arpes and first principles results presented above .",
    "we obtain the carrier density @xmath101 and the mobility @xmath102 for the electron and hole carriers , shown in supplementary figure  [ sdh]*b*.          here , @xmath106 is the non - oscillatory part of the resistivity , @xmath107 is the amplitude of the sdh oscillations , @xmath9 is the magnetic field , @xmath108 is the onsager phase , @xmath109 is the dingle temperature , @xmath110 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath111 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath112 is the frequency of the oscillations .",
    "@xmath113 is the extremal cross - sectional area of the fermi surface ( fs ) associated with the landau level ( ll ) index @xmath22 , @xmath114 is the electron charge , and @xmath115 is the planck s constant . for sample a1 , we obtain a fermi surface area of @xmath116 and a fermi wave vector @xmath117 is @xmath118 .",
    "we note that since the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath7 crystallographic axis , the obtained fermi surface area corresponds to the 2d cross - section of the 3d fermi pocket that is perpendicular to the @xmath98 direction .    the landau level index @xmath22 is plotted as a function of the inverse of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath119 ) in supplementary figure  [ sdh]*d * , from which one can see that , for all four samples , the linear interpolation of the curve intersects with the @xmath120 near zero ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this suggests that the electron carriers arise from a linearly dispersive band with a non - trivial berry s phase @xcite , consistent with the arpes and first principles results that the electron carriers mainly arise from the w1 weyl cones .",
    "in order to obtain the fermi velocity , the energy position of the chemical potential , and other important band parameters , we apply [ eq2 ] .",
    "we obtained a cyclotron mass @xmath122 of @xmath123 .",
    "we obtain the fermi wave vector @xmath117 is @xmath118 , and the fermi velocity @xmath124 is @xmath125  @xmath126 . using a linear dispersion of this electron pocket , we obtain the chemical potential ( relative to the energy of the w1 weyl node ) to be @xmath127 = @xmath128 mev for sample a1 .",
    "note that different samples have slightly different values for the chemical potential and other band parameters .",
    "this variation helps us to study the systematic dependence of the negative lmr , which is crucial for understanding its origin .    to further confirm that the observed electron carriers indeed arise from the w1 weyl cones , we study the anisotropy of the electron - like pocket by tilting the magnetic field away from the @xmath7 direction in sample a1 . our data ( supplementary figure  [ sdh]*e * ) shows that the fermi surface area along the @xmath6 axis is about 5 times larger that of along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "therefore , the transport data show that the electron - like fermi pocket is an ellipsoid that is elongated along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "we systematically check if the obtained band parameters from transport are consistent with arpes and calculation .",
    "we place the chemical potential at 11.48  mev above the weyl nodes w1 in our first - principles calculations and try to compare the calculated band parameters to those of obtained from transport .",
    "we have found an excellent agreement between calculation and transport : ( 1 ) the calculated carrier density of the electron pockets is @xmath129  @xmath130 , which agrees with our experimentally measured value in supplementary figure  [ sdh]*d*. ( 2 ) the anisotropy of the fermi surface area is found to be 4.9 , which is also in line with the experimentally determined value of 5 .    based on our systematic measurements ,",
    "we obtain a band diagram presented in supplementary figure  [ sdh]*f*. the chemical potential lies @xmath131  mev above w1 .",
    "therefore it is very close to w2 , consistent with the arpes results shown above .",
    "supplementary table  [ hole ] shows the @xmath21 ( @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath17 is the transport lifetime ) and the landau level index @xmath22 parameters of the trivial hole bands determined from our transport measurements .",
    "these parameters define the ( semiclassical or quantum ) regime .",
    "both @xmath21 and @xmath132 are a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "the values in supplementary table  [ hole ] is obtained at the magnetic field of 0.3 t , which is a representative field value where the negative lmr takes place .",
    "specifically , @xmath21 is obtained by the following relationship , @xmath133 , where @xmath102 is the carrier mobility and @xmath134 is the magnetic field .",
    "the landau level index @xmath22 is obtained from the onsager relation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath135 it can be seen that for the magnetic field of 0.3 t , none of the samples satisfy @xmath136 and landau level index @xmath18 ( @xmath95 only crosses the lowest ll ) .",
    "thus the hole bands are not in the quantum limit .",
    "this is reasonable because the negative lmr is observed at quite low field ( e.g. 0.3 t ) .    in order to extract the information of the carriers , the hall conductivity tensor @xmath137 was fitted by adopting a two - band model derived from the two - band theory @xcite , @xmath138eh,\\ ] ] where @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) denote the carrier concentrations and mobilities for the electrons ( holes ) , respectively .",
    "since there are four free parameters in this formula , we applied two constraints in the fitting process @xcite .",
    "the first constraint is the zero field resistivity.the second constraint we adopted is the hall resistivity in the large b - field limit . in high field",
    ", the hall resistivity reads @xmath143 , so we can find the value of @xmath144 by a linear fitting of the high field data .",
    "these two constraints are standard constraints in transport works , as reviewed in ref .",
    "therefore , the total number of free parameters in fits was be reduced to two .",
    "the `` @xmath145 '' and `` @xmath146 '' sign in the table means the @xmath95 being above or below the energy of the w2 weyl node , respectively.the dft calculated fermi level is the norminal fermi level directed obtained from the dft calculation .",
    "the arpes fermi level was obtained by a linear fitting of the low energy weyl fermion dispersion data ( e.g. fig .",
    "the transport fermi level data was obtained from the sdh oscillation data .",
    "we note that the fermi energy of the sample a5 is quite different from the others because sample a5 was grown by a different method where a different agent was used in the chemical vapor transport growth process .",
    "the error bars in this table are the errors in the fitting process .          in all previous studies @xcite reporting the chiral anomaly in weyl and dirac semimetals ,",
    "the authors started by assuming that the negative lmr arises from the chiral anomaly .",
    "however , the key aspect that was missed is that it is entirely possible that these systematic dependence can be also consistent with other origins of the negative lmr .",
    "specifically , none of the works have listed all possible origins for a negative lmr , and none of the works have discussed how one can distinguish each of the other origins from the chiral anomaly .",
    "this is what has been achieved in this paper .",
    "we have considered comprehensively the possible origins for a negative lmr , and we have presented systematic data and analyses that lead us to the unique conclusion of the chiral anomaly due to weyl fermions . in the process of doing that , we found that not only systematic lmr data ( temperature , angular and other dependences ) are necessary , but also having comprehensive information about the band structure at the fermi level is crucial .",
    "below we elaborate on the logical sequence of our work .    *",
    "negative lmr in magnetic element based materials : * the origin that is the easiest to exclude is the negative mr in magnetic materials , such as the giant magnetoresistance and the colossal magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "these effects do not strongly depend on the angle between the electrical @xmath12 and the magnetic @xmath13 fields and occur in both the transverse mr and longitudinal mr .",
    "this is not consistent with our observations because our taas sample is nonmagnetic and because the mr in our experiment is only negative in the presence of parallel electrical @xmath12 and magnetic @xmath13 fields .",
    "* classical ( extrinsic ) geometry or size effects : * a negative lmr can arise from a number of classical ( extrinsic ) geometry or size effects .",
    "they have been explained in detail in ref .",
    "essentially , these effects are caused by the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the current in the sample .",
    "for example , supplementary figure  [ jetting]*a * shows a schematic of a scenario where the current jetting effect can take place . because the current and voltage contacts are misaligned in a four - probe setting , the current is largely distorted to be localized in the upper part of the sample when the current @xmath147 is parallel to the magnetic field @xmath134 ( as indicated by the dotted lines ) .",
    "this causes a decrease of the measured voltage , leading to a negative lmr @xcite .",
    "other geometry or size effects are quite similar .",
    "for example , in polycrystalline samples , the inhomogeneity of the sample can also distort the current leading to a negative lmr .",
    "similarly , anisotropy of the sample can cause similar effects .    in order to exclude the geometry and size effects",
    ", the samples were shaped into long , thin bars ( thickness @xmath148 @xmath102 m ) with four silver paste contacts fully crossing their width ( supplementary figure  [ jetting]*b * ) .",
    "this precaution can effectively prevent the current from distorting . moreover , we measured many samples with different sizes ( thickness ) .",
    "all samples with different thickness exhibited comparable negative lmr .",
    "this is inconsistent with the size or geometry effect , which is expected to depend strongly on the size and the shape of the samples .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the observed negative lmr is completely suppressed at temperatures above 50 k. by contrast , the negative lmr from geometry or size effects were found to survive even at room temperatures @xcite .",
    "we also note that we observe the negative lmr with current flowing both along the crystallographic @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes .",
    "we note that taas is a tetragonal lattice .",
    "hence the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes represent the largest anisotropy that the system can offer .",
    "the fact that the negative lmr is observed along both @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes proves that it is irrelevant to the anisotropy of the system .",
    "* chiral landau levels in the quantum limit : * it has been theoretically pointed out @xcite that a negative lmr can occur in a general 3d metal if the system is in the quantum limit regime , meaning that ( 1 ) one has @xmath136",
    "( @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath17 is the transport lifetime ) and that ( 2 ) the chemical potential only crosses the lowest landau level .",
    "this is quite intuitive because in the ultra quantum limit , the system essentially has a pair of 1d chiral fermions with the opposite chiralities that arise from the lowest landau level ( supplementary figure  [ quantum]*b * ) .",
    "apparently , this construction @xcite does not depend on the band structure details and can be realized in a generic 3d metal in the ultra quantum limit .    in order to check whether our negative lmr is due to this mechanism , we have carefully studied in which regime ( semiclassical or quantum ) our samples are located at the magnetic fields corresponding to the negative lmr .",
    "we note that the negative lmr are observed in low fields ( e.g. @xmath19 t @xmath20 t for sample a1 ) .",
    "we have checked it quantitatively ( see table [ hole ] ) .",
    "for all samples studied , the system is always in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we further emphasize the tricky nature of the lmr in the quantum ( large @xmath9 field ) limit .",
    "first , as mentioned above , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible for a negative lmr to occur in a general 3d metal in the quantum limit .",
    "second , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the sign of the lmr in fact depends on the nature of the impurities in the quantum limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is even theoretically shown that the weyl cones that respect time - reversal symmetry can contribute a positive ( not a negative ) lmr in the quantum limit if the field dependence of the scattering time and fermi velocity of the landau bands is fully respected @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sign of the lmr in the quantum regime seems to depend on the details of the impurities and scattering mechanisms .",
    "it can not provide strong evidence for the weyl fermions or the chiral anomaly .    * berry curvature in the semiclassical limit : * in the semiclassical limit",
    ", a negative lmr can occur if the band structure has a nonzero berry curvature at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the negative lmr due to weyl fermions belongs to this case because weyl nodes serve as sources or drains of berry curvature .",
    "however , it is also important to note that theoretically any band with a nonzero berry curvature will contribute a term in the equation of motion that leads to a negative lmr @xcite .",
    "this means that , even up to here , after we have excluded many origins above , we can show that the observed lmr is due to the nonzero berry curvature of the band structure in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we can not yet show that it is uniquely due to the weyl fermions , let alone the chiral anomaly .",
    "thus we further show two pieces of evidence to establish the connection between the negative lmr and the weyl fermions in taas .",
    "( 1 ) we have studied the contribution of berry curvature from each bands carefully ( see supplementary figure  [ fig : berry ] ) .",
    "we show that in our taas system the berry curvature almost entirely arises from the weyl cones .",
    "the contribution from the trivial hole like bands is negligible .",
    "( 2 ) we have fitted the negative lmr and found that the chiral coefficient @xmath35 has a @xmath39 dependence .",
    "note that the @xmath39 dependence of the chiral coefficient @xmath35 is a result of the linear dispersion and the specific berry curvature distribution of the weyl cones . in order",
    "words , if one started with a different band ( not weyl ) that has a different dispersion and a different distribution of the berry curvature , then the expression of the chiral coefficient would have been different and the @xmath149 dependence would have been invalid . these data and analyses show that the observed negative lmr is not due to the trivial hole bands .",
    "instead , it arises from the weyl fermions in taas .",
    "we emphasize that this last step is crucial .",
    "one of the reasons that this can be achieved in our study is that we have systematically mapped out the band structure using three independent ways ( first - principles , arpes and quantum oscillations ) .",
    "all the other systematic dependences , including the ( @xmath12 vs @xmath13 ) angle , temperature , and the current direction with respect to the crystallographic axis , which are presented here and also in ref .",
    "@xcite , can _ * not * _ distinguish the negative lmr due to weyl fermions from the negative lmr due to other band structures with nonzero berry curvature .",
    "in other words , if a negative lmr were induced by a ( non - weyl ) band structure due to its nonzero berry curvature , then it will also show quantitatively the same angular , temperature , and current direction dependences .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that it is crucial to have full information of the band structure of the system studied in transport . also , the @xmath39 dependence of the chiral coefficient @xmath35 , which is uniquely presented here not in other studies , is crucial because it really depends on the details of the band dispersion and berry curvature distribution of the weyl cones , not just the fact that the bands have some nonzero berry curvature .      in order to calculate the berry curvature of the band structure",
    ", we built a @xmath150 model whose general structure was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath151 has a nodal ring in the @xmath152 plane that is protected by mirror symmetry .",
    "when spin - orbit coupling is included , the degeneracy of the nodal ring is lifted by the mass terms @xmath153 that contribute to @xmath154 below .",
    "the combinations of these mass terms can give rise to pairs of weyl nodes off the @xmath152 plane .",
    "a pair of weyl nodes in the @xmath155-plane are generated by the combination of the masses @xmath156 and @xmath157 , while the weyl nodes away from the @xmath155-plane stem from the interplay of @xmath156 and @xmath158 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 , are the @xmath161 identity matrix and the three pauli matrices acting on the spin degree of freedom of the electrons and @xmath162 , are the @xmath161 identity matrix and the three pauli matrices acting on an effective orbital degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath163 mirror symmetry , as well as the combination of time - reversal and @xmath164 rotation symmetry , impose whether each term is even or odd under @xmath163 and under @xmath165 .",
    "we expand each term up to a given order in @xmath166 , including only symmetry - allowed contributions :      we then fitted this @xmath150 hamiltonian to the first - principle band structure with the goal to reproduce the ring - shaped trivial fermi surface and the correct location and number of weyl nodes .",
    "this is achieved with the parameters @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , all in units of mev and the appropriate power of @xmath184 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian was used to compute the berry curvature @xmath185 , where @xmath186 are nondegenerate bloch states .",
    "( for the isolated degeneracy points in the bz we have to consider the non - abelian form of the berry curvature . )",
    "figure  [ fig : berry ] shows the average of @xmath187 over a contour of equal energy @xmath188 weighted with the density of states @xmath189 at this energy . while the density of states is featureless , the averaged berry curvature is strongly enhanced near the weyl nodes w1 and w2 .",
    "we clearly observe two peaks in @xmath190 which stem from the dominant berry curvature near the weyl nodes w1 and w2 ( notice the log scale ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : berry ] also shows that no other anomalous sources of diverging berry curvature exist in the band structure , besides the weyl nodes .",
    "( the actual divergence at the weyl points is cut off due to the numerical accuracy . )",
    "this proves that the weyl cones really dominate the contribution to the berry curvature , and that the contribution from the trivial hole like bands is negligible .",
    "firstly , we discuss the 3d weak anti - localization ( wal ) term .",
    "the 3d wal effect , the @xmath29 term in the fitting formula , accounts for the initial steep uprise of the lmr at small magnetic fields . in the fitting formula",
    ", we have included a critical field @xmath32 that characterizes the crossover from a @xmath30 dependence near zero field to @xmath31 dependence at higher fields .",
    "here we describe the underlying physical reason for this crossover carefully .",
    "@xmath192 is related to the phase coherence length @xmath193 . at low temperatures and no intervalley scattering , @xmath194 ,",
    "theory predicts a @xmath31 dependence of the wal @xcite .",
    "this means that one has @xmath195 . in the other limit , meaning high temperatures or in the presence of strong inter - valley scattering , @xmath196 , and a @xmath30 dependence is theoretically expected @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath192 is large .",
    "roughly , @xmath197 empirically , the temperature dependence of the phase coherence length can be written as @xmath198 , then @xmath199 , where @xmath93 is positive and determined by decoherence mechanisms such as electron - electron interaction ( @xmath200 ) or electron - phonon interaction ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "also , we expect that the intervalley scattering may correct @xmath193 from these simple power law .    in fig .",
    "3a of the main text , we have presented the temperature dependent lmr data for sample a1 and their fits . here in supplementary figure  [ bc ]",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath192 as a function of temperature . it can be seen that at low temperatures the @xmath192 is almost zero , which indicates that the wal follows well the @xmath31 dependence . at higher temperature",

    "we fit the @xmath192 as a function of @xmath202 , from which we extract that @xmath203 , indicating that the electron - electron interaction is the dominant decoherence mechanism .    secondly , regarding the @xmath34 term in the fitting formula ( [ fit ] ) .",
    "we note that it contributes the positive lmr that arises from the drude conductivity of conventional charge carriers present in taas . in parallel fields ,",
    "the lorentz force is zero so the drude conductivity is a constant , under the assumption that the corresponding fermi surface is isotropic . in the case of taas ,",
    "the fermi surface that gives rise to the positive lmr is the trivial hole pocket , which is quite anisotropic .",
    "thus a weak magnetic field dependence can also be possible .",
    "however , we note that even if there is a weak magnetic field dependence for the drude conductivity in parallel fields , it has to be positive because the only source of negative lmr in the semiclassical limit is the berry curvature . and",
    "as we have shown clearly in the main text , in taas , the berry curvature comes from the weyl cones , not the trivial hole pockets . in our case , we find that using a constant for the drude conductivity already gives satisfactory results for the fitting of the lmr data , which is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "this also reduces free parameters in the fitting , making the fitting more robust .",

    "<S> perhaps the most primitive example is the so - called chiral anomaly associated with weyl fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a weyl fermion is a massless fermion that carries a definite chirality . due to the chiral anomaly , the chiral charge of weyl fermions </S>",
    "<S> is not conserved by the full quantum mechanical theory . historically , the chiral anomaly was crucial in understanding a number of important aspects of the standard model of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> the most well - known case is the triangle anomaly associated with the decay of the neutral pion @xmath0 @xcite . despite having been discovered more than 40 years ago , it remained solely in the realm of high - energy physics .    </S>",

    "<S> , we present the signatures of the chiral anomaly in a low energy condensed matter weyl system . in order to measure the chiral anomaly in a solid state system </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to find a perturbation that couples differently to the two weyl fermions of opposite chiralities . </S>",
    "<S> this is most naturally realized in a weyl semimetal , in which the two weyl cones are separated in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical and experimental advances have shown that weyl fermions can arise in the bulk of certain novel semimetals with nontrivial topology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a weyl semimetal is a bulk crystal whose low energy excitations satisfy the weyl equation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the conduction and valence bands touch at discrete points , the weyl nodes , with a linear dispersion relation in all three momentum space directions moving away from the weyl node . the nontrivial topological nature of a weyl semimetal guarantees that weyl fermions with opposite chiralities are separated in momentum space ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> remains lacking despite the volume of works reporting negative lmr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our unprecedented data and careful analyses , which go beyond a simple observation of a negative lmr , allow us to systematically exclude other possible origins for the observed negative lmr . </S>",
    "<S> these data strongly support the chiral anomaly due to weyl fermions in taas . </S>",

    "<S> * arpes band structure *    we start by presenting the key aspects of the bulk band structure of taas both in theory and in experiment . according to our first - principles calculation @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> in total there are 24 bulk weyl cones . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the 8 weyl nodes that are located on the @xmath1 as w1 and the other 16 nodes that are away from this plane as w2 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*c * ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a 13 mev offset between the energies of the w1 and w2 weyl nodes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*e * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pockets that arise from the weyl fermions are shown in blue in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*d*. apart from the weyl cones , there are additional ( non - weyl ) hole - like bands crossing the fermi level shown by the red ring - shaped contours in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*d*.    we independently study the bulk electronic structure via angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is important because relying entirely on numerical band structure calculations is not conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , numerical band calculations have little power in predicting the position of the chemical potential of real samples , which is crucial for transport experiments . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1]*f * shows an @xmath2 dispersion map that cuts across the two nearby w2 weyl cones . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion map reveals two linearly dispersive bands . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-space distance between the two crossing points is about @xmath4 @xmath5 , consistent with the calculated results . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our arpes measurement shows that the native chemical potential of the samples is very close to the energy of the w2 weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> our data also reveals the w1 weyl cones . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*g * , the energy of the w1 weyl node is below that of the w2 weyl node ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*f * ) , consistent with band calculation results . </S>",
    "<S> systematic arpes data can be found in the supplementary figure 1 and supplementary note 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe the trivial hole bands in arpes . </S>",
    "<S> the essential observations are listed as follows : ( 1 ) there are three types of bands at the fermi level , the w1 and w2 weyl nodes and a trivial hole like band . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the native chemical potential is close to the energy of the w2 weyl nodes , which is 13 mev higher than that of the w1 weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) therefore , the w1 weyl cones form electron - like pockets , the trivial hole - like bands form hole - like pockets , and the w2 weyl cones have low carrier concentration , which can be electron- or hole - like depending on the specific position of the native chemical potential with respect to the w2 weyl node in each sample batch .    * quantum oscillation data *    we have performed magneto - transport measurements on our taas samples , in order to probe the band structure at the fermi level ( supplementary figure 2 and supplementary note 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our hall data indeed reveal a coexistence of electron and hole carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained critical band parameters , such as fermi wavevector , fermi velocity , chemical potential , carrier mobilities , etc . </S>",

    "<S> all band parameters obtained from sdh oscillation are consistent with first - principles calculation and arpes results . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , this enables us to determine the position of the chemical potential with respect to the weyl nodes , as shown in figures  [ fig2]*i*. we name the samples by a letter ( a or c ) followed by a number ( 1 - 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the letter a or c means that the electrical current is along the crystallographic @xmath6 or @xmath7 axes . </S>",
    "<S> the number 1 - 5 refers to a sequence of the samples chemical potential with respect to the energy of the w2 weyl node from below the node to above the node ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*i * ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the fermi energy of the taas samples determined by different approaches in supplementary note 3 and supplementary table 1 .    * </S>",
    "<S> longitudinal magnetoresistance *    we now present our lmr data , without a pre - biased assumption of their origin . </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*a - e * show the lmr data on 5 different batches of samples . </S>",
    "<S> the lmr data show three main features as a function of the magnetic field , as schematically drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*f*. at very small fields close to @xmath8 , we observe a sharp increase of the lmr . following the sharp increase , </S>",
    "<S> the lmr is found to decrease in an intermediate @xmath9 field range . </S>",
    "<S> this is the negative lmr . </S>",
    "<S> while further increasing the @xmath9 field , the lmr starts to increase again . </S>",
    "<S> we note that because features i and ii likely have independent origins , the lmr is not necessarily absolutely negative ( we do , however , observe absolute negative lmr in samples c2 and c4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , most precisely , the negative lmr means a negative response of the lmr as one increases the @xmath9 field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these general features , we observe other more sample dependent features : for sample c4 , our data show clear quantum oscillations at a quite wide @xmath9 field range of @xmath10 t @xmath11 t. for other samples , the quantum oscillations are much weaker but they are still visible . for sample a5 , </S>",
    "<S> the lmr increases monotonically as a function of the @xmath9 field . </S>",
    "<S> no negative lmr is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the systematic dependence of the lmr on different parameters , including temperature , the angle between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 fields , and the direction of the current with respect to the crystallographic axis . the temperature dependent data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*a * for sample a1 . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , the negative lmr ( feature ii ) shows a strong temperature dependence . at higher temperatures , e.g. @xmath14 k , the negative lmr vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the angle between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 fields are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*b - e*. our data show that the negative mr exhibits a very strong angular dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes quickly suppressed as one varies the direction of the magnetic @xmath13 field away from that of the electric @xmath12 field . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the direction of the current with respect to the crystallographic direction is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed with current along the crystallographic @xmath6 axis for samples a1 , a3 and a5 , and with current along the @xmath7 axis for samples c2 and c4 . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the negative lmr is observed except for sample a5 , whose chemical potential is far away from the energy of the weyl nodes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*i * ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * origins of the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance *    we now use these observations to understand the origin of the negative lmr . first , it is well - known that a negative lmr can arise in magnetic materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this obviously does not apply to our non - magnetic taas samples . </S>",
    "<S> the second possible origin is more classical due to geometry or size effects of the samples , such as the current jetting effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these geometrical mr effects are also not consistent with our data , because they do not vanish quickly as one raises temperature @xcite , and furthermore we have carefully shaped our samples to exclude the geometrical effects ( supplementary figure 3 and supplementary note 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , we observe the negative lmr with current flowing both along the crystallographic @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes . </S>",
    "<S> we note that taas has a tetragonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> hence the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes represent the largest anisotropy that the system could offer . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the negative lmr is observed along both @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes proves that anisotropies in the system can not explain our data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , in the quantum limit , negative lmr can arise from the chiral , quasi one - dimensional character of the landau levels that are formed by the band structure under magnetic fields . essentially , it was predicted @xcite that a negative lmr can arise in any 3d metal irrespective of its band structure if the sample is in the ultra quantum limit , which means that one has @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath17 is the transport lifetime ) and that the chemical potential only crosses the lowest landau level ( lll ) ( the landau level index @xmath18 , see supplementary figure 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this has been observed in doped semiconductor samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have carefully checked whether our negative lmr is due to this mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , one needs to be careful about the trivial hole - like bands in taas , because if they were in the ultra quantum limit then it would have been entirely possible that the observed negative lmr were due to these trivial bands , rather than due to weyl fermions in our samples . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the negative lmr are observed at small magnetic fields ( e.g. @xmath19 t @xmath20 t for sample a1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the @xmath21 and the landau level index @xmath22 of our samples quantitatively ( supplementary table 2 ) , and our results show that all samples are always in the semiclassical limit at the small magnetic fields where the negative lmr are observed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our data are inconsistent with this origin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fifth , a recent theoretical work has predicted a linear b dependent magneto - conductivity in small fields @xcite . however , this is also inconsistent with our data because predicted linear b dependent magneto - conductivity requires the system to lie in the ultra - quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> that is , only the lowest landau band crosses the fermi level , which is clearly not the case for our systems under study . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the semiclassical limit , nonzero lmr can arise from finite berry curvature , as follows from the semiclassical equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> having excluded all other possibilities , we are led to conclude that our observed negative lmr must have this origin </S>",
    "<S> . however , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that any berry curvature not associated with berry monopoles , i.e. , not coming from weyl nodes , will contribute a positive lmr . </S>",
    "<S> the observed negative lmr should thus be attributed to weyl nodes , in accordance with the theoretical analysis of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to confirm this picture independent of the assumption of effective low - energy weyl hamiltonians , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the contribution of berry curvature from each band carefully in a first - principles derived model for taas ( see figures .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*c , d * and supplementary figure 5 and supplementary note 5 . ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in our taas system the berry curvature almost entirely arises from the weyl cones .    </S>",
    "<S> * the chiral anomaly *    with such a conclusion , we are entitled to fit our lmr data with a semiclassical magnetoconductance formula that includes the contribution from weyl nodes due to their berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we use the following equation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 all coefficients are positive . </S>",
    "<S> the first term @xmath24 is due to the weyl fermions and will lead to a @xmath25 dependent negative lmr . </S>",
    "<S> this term was systematically studied by transport theories in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral coefficient is @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath28 is the axial charge relaxation time , and the additional factor of 8 is because we have 8 pairs of w2 weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> all remaining terms contribute to positive lmr in the semiclassical regime . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 term arises from the 3d weak antilocalization ( wal ) effect of the weyl cones , which accounts for the initial steep uprise of the lmr at small magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d wal is known to have a @xmath30 dependence near zero field and @xmath31 dependence at higher fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so we include a critical field @xmath32 that characterizes a crossover . </S>",
    "<S> for the four samples a1 , c2 , a3 , c4 , the increase of the lmr at small magnetic fields are 230% , 5% , 156% , and 47% comparing to the zero field resistance . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the increase for samples a1 and a3 is larger than 100% , which is usually not expected from the wal scenario . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we do notice that the increase is quite sample dependent , and that a similarly large increase ( @xmath33 ) of the magneto - resistance has also been reported in a concurrent transport work on taas @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we fit this initial uprise of the lmr by the wal effects , but the anomalously large increase in samples a1 , a3 and also in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite remain an theoretically open question that needs further investigation , which does not affect our main conclusion , i.e. , signatures of the chiral anomaly . finally , the @xmath34 term is the positive lmr that arises from the drude conductivity of conventional charge carriers present in taas . in parallel fields , </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz force is zero so the drude conductivity is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> more systematic details regarding the fitting are presented in supplementary figure 6 and supplementary note 6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fitting results are shown by the green curves in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*a - e * and figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*a , b*. it can be seen that the fitting works well for the small @xmath9 field region which includes the negative lmr . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable because the fitting formula is derived in the semiclassical limit . </S>",
    "<S> the angle dependence of the chiral coefficient @xmath35 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*b * for sample a3 , which demonstrates @xmath35 is only significant in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we study the chemical potential dependence of the lmr data . </S>",
    "<S> our fitting captures quantitatively the relative size of the low - field positive lmr and the higher - field negative lmr as a function of chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we plot this ratio as a dimensionless quantity in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*a*. we find that despite the simple form of the fitting formula , the different measurement geometries for the different samples , the presence of large quantum oscillations in sample c4 and large differences in the absolute resistivities of different samples , the chiral anomaly ratio scales as @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that this fitting result matches the simplest theoretical model for a weyl point , where the berry curvature @xmath37 . we emphasize that this provides powerful evidence that the negative lmr is due to the weyl fermions . </S>",
    "<S> note that the specific expression of the chiral coefficient , @xmath38 , is a result of the linear dispersion and the specific berry curvature distribution of the weyl cones ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the energy of the w2 weyl nodes is nothing special for the trivial hole bands . </S>",
    "<S> thus if the negative lmr arose from the hole bands , then the chiral coefficient @xmath35 would have not increased dramatically as the chemical potential approaches the energy of the w2 weyl nodes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*a * ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the obtained @xmath39 dependence of the chiral coefficient ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*a * ) provides a unique demonstration that our negative lmr is due to the weyl fermions , because the @xmath39 dependence reveals the details of the band dispersion and berry curvature distribution of the weyl cones , not just the fact that the bands have some nonzero berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we use the above data and analyses to further exclude the possibility of negative lmr due to weak localization arising from the intervalley scattering . </S>",
    "<S> our data is not due to weak localizations for the following reasons : first , weak localization does not have a strong @xmath40 dependence , let alone the dramatic @xmath39 dependence observed in our data . </S>",
    "<S> second , it has been theoretically shown that the magnetoconductivity without the chiral anomaly is always monotonic , even though the intervalley scattering can induce a negative lmr arising from the weak localization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not consistent with our data , which means that , without the chiral anomaly , only weak localization / anti - localization can not explain our data .    </S>",
    "<S> up to here , we have demonstrated that the negative lmr arises from the nonzero berry curvature of the weyl fermions in our taas samples . </S>",
    "<S> we now establish the connection between our data and the chiral anomaly , the nonconservation of the electron quasiparticle number of the weyl cones with a given chirality . in a real weyl </S>",
    "<S> semimetal sample , this can be understood by two crucial components , the axial charge pumping effect and the axial charge relaxation , as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*f*. the charge pumping effect means that a nonzero @xmath41 can pump charges from one weyl cone to the other , leading to an imbalance of the quasiparticle number of the weyl cones with the opposite chiralities . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is well established to occur between weyl nodes of different chiral charge @xcite , which are monopoles of berry field strength in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we have directly show the nontrivial berry curvature monopoles associated with the weyl fermions via our lmr transport data . </S>",
    "<S> the axial charge pumping creates an out - of - equilibrium quasiparticle distribution between the weyl cones with opposite chiralities . to form a steady state , </S>",
    "<S> it is counteracted by the relaxation of the axial charge disproportionation through scattering between the weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation is characterized by a time scale , the axial charge relaxation time @xmath28 . from our negative lmr data , </S>",
    "<S> we directly obtain the axial charge relaxation time @xmath28 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*e * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero axial charge relaxation time @xmath28 not only directly demonstrates the axial charge relaxation , but also confirms the existence of the axial charge pumping because these two are directly coupled , which means that one can not exist alone if the other is absent .    we can directly obtain the axial charge relaxation time @xmath28 , which serves as the critical physical quantity that characterizes the chiral anomaly , from the chiral coefficient @xmath35 using the relationship @xmath26 @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*a * , we present fitting results as a function of temperature for sample s1 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the fitting coefficients @xmath35 to obtain the axial charge relaxation time as a function of temperature , presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*e*. we find that the @xmath28 rapidly decays to zero with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this decay of @xmath28 corresponds to the decay of the negative lmr with increasing temperature in the raw data and is expected because scattering typically increases with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an axial charge relaxation time @xmath42 s for sample a1 at @xmath43 k ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]*e * ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that this @xmath28 is associated with the w2 weyl cones because the fermi level is very close to the w2 nodes . on the other hand , it is difficult to obtain the transport life time of the w2 weyl cones because the density of states at the fermi level is dominated by contributions from the w1 weyl cones and the trivial hole bands ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*d * ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we estimate the quasiparticle life time associated with the w2 weyl cones via @xmath44 s for sample a1 . we see that the axial charge relaxation time @xmath28 is much longer than the quasiparticle life time @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the imbalance of population due to the axial charge pumping can be also estimated by the uncertainty principle @xmath45 mev . at @xmath46 mev , </S>",
    "<S> the density of states per w2 weyl cone is @xmath47 states/(ev@xmath48@xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we estimate the chiral charge , the non - conservation of the quasi - particle number of the weyl cone with a given chirality , to be @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this directly characterizes the chiral anomaly in our weyl semimetal taas sample .      </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the critical logical sequences that are key to our demonstration . unlike previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , we do not assume that the negative lmr arises from the chiral anomaly @xcite . in order to demonstrate the chiral anomaly , it is critically important to consider all possible origins for a negative lmr and to discuss how one can distinguish each of the other origins from the chiral anomaly </S>",
    "<S> . this has been achieved for the first time here . </S>",
    "<S> we first excluded the geometry and spin(magnetic ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> then we show that our observed lmr is not in the quantum ( large @xmath9 field ) limit , in which the fermi energy crosses only the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> this is important because the lmr in the quantum ( large @xmath9 field ) limit can be negative or positive depending on specific scenarios , such as the band dispersion and nature of the impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is even theoretically shown that the weyl cones that respect time - reversal symmetry can contribute a positive ( not a negative ) lmr in the quantum limit if the field dependence of the scattering time and fermi velocity of the landau bands is fully respected @xcite . therefore , observing a negative lmr in the large - field quantum limit @xcite may not be a compelling signature of weyl fermions . in the semiclassical ( small @xmath9 field ) limit , after excluding the geometry and magnetic effects , one can avoid ambiguities in the physical interpretation since a negative lmr can only arise from a nonzero berry curvature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown that the lmr from a band with zero berry curvature will always be positive @xcite . however , we emphasize that the negative lmr in the semiclassical limit is only a signature of the berry curvature but it is not unique to weyl fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic ( temperature , angular , current direction ) dependence can not distinguish the negative lmr due to weyl fermions from the negative lmr due to other band structures with nonzero berry curvature because they are expected to show the same qualitative dependence independent of weyl or non - weyl bands . in order to uniquely attribute the negative lmr to weyl fermions , we discovered here that it is crucial to obtain comprehensive information about the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , first we have shown that the berry curvature in our taas is dominated by the weyl cones . </S>",
    "<S> second , the chiral coefficient has a @xmath39 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> these two pieces of evidence , together with the full systematics of the datasets uniquely presented here , provides strong signatures of the chiral anomaly of weyl fermions .    </S>",
