    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is well known as the simplest representative and the most accurate gauge theory .",
    "thermal medium effects are incorporated in qed by taking into account the vacuum fluctuations of propagating particles along with the hot particles in the background heat bath . for simplicity ,",
    "all the particles in the background are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath .",
    "these particles are virtually created and annihilated continuously due to the effects of heat bath at finite temperature .",
    "the interactions with the background electrons , positrons and photons are included through statistical distribution functions of fermions and bosons , known as fermi - dirac distribution and bose - einstein distribution .",
    "these distribution functions represent the possibility of exchange of virtual particles with the real hot particles from the heat bath .",
    "electromagnetic interactions of particles get modified at finite temperature because of the many - body aspects of the statistical background possessed by the hot medium .",
    "this replaces the notion of one - particle systems adopted for particle interactions in the vacuum with many particle aspects .    the techniques for handling the particle interactions in the background medium have extensively evolved over the last few decades and are a part of standard literature ( see for example [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and references therein ) .",
    "it has been explicitly demonstrated [ 3 - 10 ] that in the hot background , the density - of - states factors have to be modified to include the real emission and absorption of particles which are in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath .",
    "the validity of qed renormalization in a background of particles is refined by comparing the second order ( in @xmath0 ) corrections with the first order corrections from the heat bath .",
    "it is explicitly seen , as expected , that one - loop radiative corrections are significantly larger than the two - loop corrections .",
    "our scheme of calculations is based on the real part of the propagator and the results are valid , at least below the decoupling temperature [ 11 ] , i.e. , around 2 mev .",
    "renormalization techniques of vacuum theory are extended to include finite temperature effects in a standard manner .",
    "regular renormalization procedure for qed in vacuum is used at finite temperature to study the background effects on electron mass , charge and wave function renormalization constants .",
    "the modifications in the electromagnetic properties are estimated in terms of the renormalized values of qed parameters up to the two loop level [ 3 - 19 ] .",
    "feynman rules at finite temperature remain the same as those in vacuum except that the particle propagators are appropriately modified .",
    "we work in minkowski space where the green s functions depend on real minkowski momenta @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical processes such as particles propagating in the heat bath may be more conveniently dealt with . moreover , in the real - time formulation , the thermal corrections can be easily kept separate from the vacuum corrections .",
    "therefore , order by order cancellation of temperature dependent singularities , and the convergence of perturbative expansion can be straight away tracked down .    in this paper , thermal contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of electron are specifically studied .",
    "the magnetic moment of electron modifies through the radiative corrections to the electron mass both at the one loop and two loop levels .",
    "we analyze net effect from the first order and the second order radiative contributions , including both the irreducible and disconnected graphs up to the two loop level .",
    "second order selfmass corrections due to finite temperature ( of the order @xmath2 ) are used here to estimate finite temperature effects on the magnetic moment of electron .",
    "the renormalized mass of electron is represented by a physical mass given as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the electron mass at zero temperature .",
    "radiatively corrected physical mass up to order @xmath2  is    @xmath5    with @xmath6 and @xmath7  as the shifts in the electron mass at one and two loop level respectively .",
    "the physical mass is deduced by locating pole of the propagator @xmath8 . for this purpose ,",
    "all finite terms in electron self - energy are combined together .",
    "the physical mass of the electron at one loop was obtained by writing    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the relevant coefficients . taking the inverse of the propagator with momentum and mass term separated as    @xmath13    the temperature - dependent radiative corrections to the electron mass up to the first order in @xmath0 , are obtained from the temperature modified propagator .",

    "( 8) is valid for large temperatures relevant in qed including @xmath32 @xmath33 this range of temperature is particularly interesting  from the point of view of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "it has been found that some parameters in the early universe such as the energy density and the helium abundance parameter @xmath34 become slowly varying functions of temperature [ 20 - 22 ] whereas they remain constant in both extreme limits given by @xmath35  and @xmath36 .    using the same procedure as the one used for one loop calculations , the relative shift in electron mass at the two loop level",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "this relative shift in electron mass introduces temperature dependence in the magnetic moment of electron up to two loops .",
    "however , the two - loop order result is very complicated and can not be easily simplified .",

    "some of these results that are used here were given in ref .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling is affected by the electron mass and the radiative corrections to the electron mass .",
    "the coupling of electron mass with the external magnetic field is regulated through mass of the particle itself .",
    "it is known from the calculation of the radiative corrections that the self - mass corrections to the electron are contributed by the distribution of hot bosons and fermions in the background medium .",
    "this effect , in turn , changes the electromagnetic properties of the medium itself . therefore the magnetic moment",
