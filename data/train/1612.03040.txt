    "according to nowadays observations , present acceleration of the universe expansion has been well established @xcite . within the framework of general relativity , the responsible component of energy for this accelerated expansion is known as _ dark energy _ ( de ) with negative pressure .",
    "however , the nature of de is still unknown , and some candidates have been proposed to explain it . the earliest and simplest candidate is the cosmological constant with the time independent equation of state @xmath8 which has some problems like fine - tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "therefore , other theories have been suggested for the dynamical de scenario to describe the accelerating universe .",
    "an interesting attempt for probing the nature of de within the framework of quantum gravity , is the so - called hde proposal .",
    "this model which has arisen a lot of enthusiasm recently @xcite , is motivated from the holographic hypothesis @xcite and has been tested and constrained by various astronomical observations @xcite . in holographic principle a short distance cutoff",
    "could be related to a long distance cutoff ( infrared cutoff ) due to the limit set by formation of a black hole .",
    "based on the holographic principle , it was shown by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath2 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath2 is the ir cutoff .",
    "the largest @xmath2 allowed is the one saturating this inequality so that we get the @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "there are many models of hde , depending on the ir cutoff , that have been studied in the literatures @xcite .",
    "the simple choice for ir cutoff is the hubble radius , i.e. , @xmath13 which leads to a wrong equation of state ( eos ) and the accelerated expansion of the universe can not be achieved .",
    "however , as soon as an interaction between hde and dark matter is taken into account , the identification of ir cutoff with hubble radius @xmath14 , in flat universe , can simultaneously drive accelerated expansion and solve the coincidence problem . @xcite .",
    "then , li @xcite showed that taking the particle horizon radius as ir cutoff it is impossible to obtain an accelerated expansion .",
    "he also demonstrated that the identification of @xmath2 with the radius of the future event horizon gives the desired result , namely a sufficiently negative equation of state to obtain an accelerated universe .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the sake of simplicity , very often the @xmath6 parameter in the hde model is assumed constant .",
    "however , there are no strong evidences to demonstrate that @xmath6 should be a constant and one should bear in mind that it is more general to consider it a slowly varying function of time .",
    "it has been shown that the parameter @xmath6 can play an essential role in characterizing the model .",
    "for example , it was argued that the hde model in the far future can be like a phantom or quintessence de model depending whether the parameter @xmath6 is larger or smaller than @xmath15 , respectively @xcite . by",
    "slowly vary function with time , we mean that @xmath16 is upper bounded by the hubble expansion rate , i.e. , @xcite @xmath17 where dot indicates derivative with respect to the cosmic time . in this case",
    "the time scale of the evolution of @xmath6 is shorter than @xmath14 and one can be satisfied to consider the time dependency of @xmath6 @xcite . considering the future event horizon as ir cutoff , the hde model with time",
    "varying parameter @xmath6 , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that depending on the parameter @xmath6 , the phantom regime can be achieved earlier or later compared to the usual hde with constant @xmath6 term @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the hde model with the slowly varying parameter @xmath18 by taking into account the hubble horizon @xmath4 and go cutoff , @xmath19 , as the system s ir cutoffs .",
    "we shall study four parameterizations of @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 where ghde stands for the generalized hde model .",
    "the above choices for @xmath20 are , respectively , inspired by the parameterizations known as chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization ( cpl ) @xcite , jassal - bagla - padmanabhan ( jbp ) parametrization @xcite , wetterich parametrization @xcite , and ma - zhang parametrization @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath22 in all these four parameterizations , the original hde with constant @xmath23 parameter is recovered .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we drive the basic equations for the hde with time varying @xmath6 parameter . in this section , we also consider the hubble radius as ir cutoff and derive the evolution of eos and deceleration parameters by choosing @xmath20 . in section iii , we repeat the study for the go cutoff and investigate the evolution of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in the context of flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , the friedmann equation can be written @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energy densities of pressureless dark matter and de , respectively . by using the dimensionless energy densities @xmath27 the friedmann equation ( [ friedeq1 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath28 we shall assume there is no interaction between dark matter and ghde .",
    "therefore , both components obey independent conservation equation .",
    "the conservation equations for pressureless dark matter and de , are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the eos parameter of ghde . in this section",
    "we consider the hubble radius as ir cutoff , @xmath31 , thus the energy density of ghde model from ( [ hde ] ) can be written as @xmath32 using definition ( [ omega ] ) , the dimensionless energy density for the ghde becomes @xmath33 taking the time derivative of eq .",

    "this implies that the hde model with @xmath4 as ir cutoff can not describe an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "in contrast , taking the time varying @xmath6 term in the energy density of the hde , it is quite possible to reproduce the acceleration of the cosmic expansion in hde model with the hubble radius as ir cutoff .",
    "another important cosmological parameter for studying the evolution of the universe is the deceleration parameter which is given by @xmath41 substituting eq .",
    "( [ hdot1 ] ) into ( [ q1 ] ) yields @xmath42 again for @xmath43 the declaration parameter reduces to @xmath44 which implies a decelerated universe .",

    "<S> we reconsider the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model with a slowly time varying @xmath0 parameter in the energy density , namely @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ir cutoff and @xmath3 is the redshift parameter . as the system s ir cutoff we choose the hubble radius and the granda - oliveros ( go ) cutoffs . </S>",
    "<S> the latter inspired by the ricci scalar curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the evolution of the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and the deceleration parameters as the explicit functions of the redshift parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we plot the evolutions of these cosmological parameters in terms of the redshift parameter during the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , we observe that by choosing @xmath4 as the ir cutoff for the hde with time varying @xmath5 term , the present acceleration of the universe expansion can be achieved , even in the absence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the usual hde model with constant @xmath6 term , which leads to a wrong equation of state , namely that for dust @xmath7 , when the ir cutoff is chosen the hubble radius . </S>"
