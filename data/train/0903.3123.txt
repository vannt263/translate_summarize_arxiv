    "x - ray emission in early - type galaxies partly originate from the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) which is distributed throughout the galaxy , and partly from the population of point - like sources , known as low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( trienchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "the spectra of the x - ray emission in these galaxies are typically fitted with a two - component model : a soft 1kev thermal component for hot , diffuse ism and a hard 1.6 photon index power law component for the contribution from the point sources ( irwin et al .",
    "though the diffuse x - ray emission is a powerful tool for tracing the past star formation and central massive black hole activity through their effects on the ism ( strickland et al .",
    "2000 ) , the later component is more important in the case of fainter galaxies ( matsushita 2001 ) .",
    "the superb angular resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope for the first time has made possible to spatially resolve the point sources in extragalactic environment . in this paper",
    "we present morphology and spectral properties of hot gas and point - like sources in some early - type galaxies . +",
    "x - ray data on target galaxies ngc 3245 , ngc 3607 , ngc 3923 and ngc 4365 were acquired from public archive of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "level-1 processed event files provided by the pipeline processing of _ chandra _ x - ray centre were used for this study .",
    "the acquired x - ray data was homogeneously processed using ciao ( chandra interactive analysis of observations ) science threads . a more detailed discussion on the x - ray data analysis is given in strickland et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the point sources present in the field of view centred on the target galaxies were identified and adaptively removed using the task _ wavdetect _ available within ciao .",

    "dmfilth_. finally , the  filled - in \" smooth , diffuse x - ray images were produced in different energy bands i.e. , soft ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) , medium ( 1 - 2 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) using the task _",

    "these results are consistent with the spectral analysis of the combined emission from lmxbs in a sample of 15 early - type galaxies analyzed by irwin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . while , the spectra of the diffuse emission component in the target galaxies were fitted by a hot plasma code ( vmekal ) along with a power law function . figure 1(b ) represents x - ray spectrum of ngc 3923 for the diffuse gas alone .",

    "the spectrum derived for ngc 3923 ( figure 1(b ) ) shows lines from s , si , ne , mg and fe . we tried to determine the si / fe and s / fe ratios by fitting a modified vmekal model to the diffuse gas component .",
    "all the other elemental abundances were allowed to vary freely , except he which was set to solar value .",
    "we find z@xmath5/z@xmath6 ratio in ngc 3923 to be about 4.2 , which is an indicator that the ism is enriched by the supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the resulting best - fit power - law indices fitted for diffuse gas and detected point - sources are consistent with those derived from fitting the combined emission from the detected point sources .",
    "this shows that the spectral index of lmxbs does not vary significantly with the luminosity .",
    "emission from lmxbs is significant in these galaxies and have a contribution lying between 30 to 65% to the total x - ray emission of the target galaxies .",
