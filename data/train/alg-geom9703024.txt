    "the discovery of kollr and shepherd  barron in @xcite that the reduced components of the versal base space of a quotient singularity are in one - to - one correspondence with the p - resolutions of this singularity provided a more conceptual understanding of the deformation theory of cyclic quotient singularities .",
