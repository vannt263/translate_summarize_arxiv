    "the response of many  body systems to an external , weakly coupled field provides much insight regarding the correlations existing among the particles composing the system , and the forces acting among them .    while the most familiar application of mean field theory is to describe stationary states , its extension to time ",
    "dependent states provides the basis for a theory of small amplitude oscillations known as random phase approximation ( rpa ) for normal systems and qrpa for superfluid ( superconducting ) systems displaying quasiparticle excitations .",
    "especially , small amplitude oscillations describe the dynamics of the nuclear surface .",
    "couplings to the surface will influence the quasiparticle motion , renormalizing the effective mass ( @xmath2-mass @xmath3 ) , in turn leading to couplings among the different vibrational modes .",
    "a textbook example of such couplings is provided by the breaking of the giant dipole resonance in deformed nuclei ( inhomogeneous damping @xcite ) , in keeping with the fact that a permanent deformation can be viewed as a quadrupole vibration of finite inertia and of vanishing restoring force . within this context",

    "the same line of reasoning also applies to other multipolarities of the static and dynamic deformations of the mean field , which should not necessarily be only quadrupolar .    because exotic nuclei , in particular neutron halo nuclei are , as a rule , more polarizable than nuclei lying along the stability valley , one expects this to affect the modes and the associated renormalization to be especially important for such nuclei . here",
