    "the term magnetic reconnection , as commonly understood , refers to a process whereby the energy of the embedded field is transferred to the surrounding plasma via bulk acceleration and ohmic dissipation . while frequently associated with changes in the topology of the magnetic field , precisely defining where and how reconnection occurs is a surprisingly subtle task @xcite .    in what are known as 2.5d geometries , where variations in one direction are suppressed",
    ", the coupling of the reduced dimensionality with the divergence - free nature of the magnetic field allows field lines to be completely characterized as contours of a scalar function , @xmath0 .",
    "( @xmath0 is equivalent to the component of the magnetic vector potential in the invariant direction . )",
    "saddle points of @xmath0 , known as x - points , mark locations of both topological change and magnetic reconnection . in fully three - dimensional systems ,",
    "field lines can no longer be described by a single function and characterizing reconnection becomes significantly more difficult .",
    "finding the locations where magnetic reconnection occurs is non - trivial , even in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "yet simulations have the luxury of a synoptic view with , in principle , access to the complete description of the plasma at any point in the domain . spacecraft observations , in contrast , must make due with a limited set of measurements available from , at most , a few locations .",
    "the topological identification of reconnection sites is non - local in nature and hence extremely difficult to implement with these restrictions .",
    "determinations must instead be based on local measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particles .    due to their small larmor radii and brief gyroperiods ,",
    "electrons are closely tied to the magnetic field , much more so than the heavier ions . by streaming for long distances along field lines",
    "they efficiently probe magnetic structure and so locations of topological interest , such as reconnection sites , should leave signatures in electron measurements .",
    "@xcite identified one such signature by noting that , because of finite larmor radius effects , the guiding center approximation breaks down near an x - point .",
    "one consequence is that reconnection , at least in 2.5d , requires an asymmetry ( specifically , non - gyrotropy ) in the electron pressure tensor there .",
    "spacecraft measurements of electron distribution functions can hence be used as a proxy for topology . in this paper",
    "we present a diagnostic quantifying the size of departures from gyrotropy and demonstrate , through numerical simulations , that it faithfully maps regions associated with magnetic reconnection .",
    "given a distribution function @xmath1 that describes the density of particles with mass @xmath2 in a phase space defined by position ( @xmath3 ) and velocity ( @xmath4 ) , the pressure @xmath5 can be defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity relative to the mean flow @xmath8 .",
    "while @xmath5 is , in general , a tensor with six independent components , it can be characterized by a single scalar when @xmath9 is spherically symmetric ( e.g. , a maxwellian ) . a magnetic field , by imposing a preferred direction ,",
    "can produce a cylindrically symmetric , or gyrotropic , distribution . in this case",
    "the pressure tensor takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are scalars , and @xmath14 is the unit tensor . in the equivalent matrix formulation , @xmath15 observationally ,",
    "pressure tensors are never completely gyrotropic because of the presence of non - zero off - diagonal components , although these are often much smaller than the diagonal terms .",
    "since departures from gyrotropy are expected to be associated with locations of magnetic reconnection , a quantitative measure of this smallness would be useful .    with this goal in mind , @xcite proposed a measure , dubbed the agyrotropy and denoted @xmath16 , that characterizes a distribution function s weighted average of dispersions of velocities perpendicular to the local field direction ( see appendix a of their paper for a full description ) .",
    "it varies between @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the minimum supposedly corresponding to gyrotropic distributions .",
    "however , as demonstrated below , there exist agyrotropic pressure tensors for which @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite proposed another measure , denoted @xmath20 and named non - gyrotropy .",
    "it is proportional to the root - mean - square of the off - diagonal elements of the pressure tensor normalized by the local thermal energy . as with the agyrotropy , @xmath21 for a gyrotropic distribution but ,",
    "as also shown below , there exist pressure tensors with maximal departures from gyrotropy for which @xmath20 is arbitrarily close to 0 .",
    "a brief mathematical digression is necessary in order to justify a better measure .",
    "because pressure tensors originate as moments of distribution functions , their matrix representations must satisfy certain constraints . specifically",
    ", a physically meaningful pressure tensor is a real @xmath22 symmetric matrix ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) with non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "matrices possessing these properties , including all pressure tensors , are called symmetric positive semi - definite .",
    "if all of the eigenvalues are positive the matrix is positive definite .",
    "( that the eigenvalues of a pressure tensor must be non - negative follows from the requirement that after diagonalization , which is always possible for a real symmetric matrix , the matrix elements are both the eigenvalues and the components of the pressure along the basis vectors of the rotated frame . for physical distributions the latter , and hence the former , must be greater than or equal to zero . )",
    "defining a scalar measure of gyrotropy requires a result from the theory of symmetric positive semi - definite matrices .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a matrix is positive semi -",
    "definite if and only if all principal minors  the determinants of every submatrix arising from deleting the same set of rows and columns  are non - negative .",
    "( if zero eigenvalues are excluded , so that the matrix is positive definite , sylvester s criterion applies @xcite . in this case",
    ", a necessary and sufficient condition is that the leading principal minors , i.e. , the determinants of all upper - left submatrices , be positive . )",
    "a pressure tensor with gyrotropic diagonal , but non - zero off - diagonal , entries can be written as @xmath24 in this representation one of the coordinate axes points in the direction of the local magnetic field and the others are oriented such that the final two components of the diagonal of @xmath5 are equal .",
    "( that this is always possible is demonstrated in the appendix . )",
    "since @xmath5 is positive semi - definite the result discussed above implies the inequalities @xmath25 the converse does not hold : satisfaction of these inequalities does not guarantee that @xmath5 is positive semi - definite .",
    "adding the inequalities implies a natural definition for a measure of gyrotropy : @xmath26 for gyrotropic tensors @xmath27 , while for maximal departures from gyrotropy @xmath28 . evaluating @xmath29 from equation [ agyro ]",
    "requires @xmath5 to be in the form given by equation [ gyroform ] even though , in general , @xmath5 is measured in an arbitrary coordinate system .",
    "while it is always possible to rotate @xmath5 into a frame in which it has the form of equation [ gyroform ] , the appendix demonstrates how to calculate @xmath29 without such a transformation by using tensor invariants .",
    "the theory of positive semi - definite matrices provides a firm mathematical basis for the definition of @xmath29 . with it in mind , it is possible to construct pressure tensors for which other proposed measures give physically unreasonable results . consider a system with a pressure tensor , of the type shown in equation [ gyroform ] , given by @xmath30 since @xmath5 has eigenvalues of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , it is positive semi - definite and hence physically valid . yet , despite the off - diagonal elements that make it clearly not gyrotropic , @xmath34 for reference , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in this case .",
    "( the other gyrotropy measures considered here scale as ratios of first powers of pressure components while @xmath29 scales quadratically .",
    "the subsequent discussion , where necessary to ensure an unbiased comparison , uses @xmath37 . )    in fact @xmath38 for any positive semi - definite @xmath5 in the form of equation [ gyroform ] with @xmath39 , irrespective of the other off - diagonal components .",
    "this occurs because , by construction , @xmath16 only measures departures from symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field axis .",
    "however , as equation [ sc_ex ] demonstrates , there are other ways in which pressure tensors can depart from gyrotropy .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath16 for such cases indicates that it does not fully describe a pressure tensor s gyrotropy .    the nongyrotropy measure proposed by @xcite",
    "is defined as @xmath40 the most significant difference between it and @xmath37 occurs in the normalization , which for @xmath20 is to the thermal energy , @xmath41 . as with the other measures , @xmath21 for gyrotropic tensors",
    "the maximum value of @xmath20 varies with @xmath42 , which is not the case for either @xmath29 or @xmath43 .",
    "its global maximum of @xmath44 occurs when @xmath45 .",
    "the implications of this variation become apparent through consideration of the pressure tensor @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath17 , @xmath17 , and @xmath48 mean that @xmath5 is positive semi - definite .",
    "the gyrotropy measures are @xmath49 this pressure tensor is maximally non - gyrotropic for any value of @xmath50 because any perturbation that increases the off - diagonal components will drive one of the eigenvalues negative .",
    "any measure of the gyrotropy for this @xmath5 should thus be independent of @xmath50 and should take its maximal value .",
    "yet @xmath20 varies with @xmath50 .",
    "this behavior does not depend on @xmath5 having zero eigenvalues , although such a case is the simplest to analyze .",
    "similar pressure tensors exist that both have three positive eigenvalues exist and approach arbitrarily close to maximal non - gyrotropy yet for which @xmath20 varies in a manner similar to equation [ au_d ] .    the examples of equations [ sc_ex ] and [ au_ex ] are instances where the deficiencies of @xmath16 and @xmath20 in quantifying gyrotropy are particularly clear .",
    "to a lesser or greater degree similar issues will be present for other pressure tensors , although in any specific example it may be difficult to tease out the degree to which the gyrotropy is mischaracterized .",
    "while the arguments of the previous section suggest that @xmath29 is a good measure of gyrotropy , it is a separate question as to whether it is also useful as a proxy for the identification of reconnection sites . as a first attempt at an answer , we investigate particle - in - cell simulations performed with the code p3d @xcite .",
    "it employs units based on a field strength @xmath51 and density @xmath52 , with lengths normalized to the ion inertial length @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ion plasma frequency , and times to the ion cyclotron time @xmath55 .",
    "we first consider a variation of the standard gem challenge @xcite .",
    "the simulation domain has dimensions @xmath56 with an initial magnetic field of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "there is no initial field component in the @xmath59 direction . to ensure pressure balance , the density @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , and the electron and ion temperatures are initially isotropic with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the ion - to - electron mass ratio is 400 and the speed of light is 40 .",
    "the spatial grid has resolution @xmath64 , which means there are 8 gridpoints per electron inertial length ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 per electron larmor radius in the maximum field .",
    "there are @xmath67 particles per cell for each species in the asymptotic region .",
    "images of @xmath37 ( panel a ) and @xmath68 ( panel b ) with superimposed magnetic field lines ( dotted ) for the run described in section [ gemlike ] .",
    "colors represent different values in each image ; the central bar shows the relative variation .",
    "the data have been averaged over @xmath69 , or @xmath70 electron larmor orbits in the asymptotic field , and over @xmath71 in each direction .",
    "the panels on the right show cuts along the corresponding colored lines in the main images . ]",
    "figure [ gyr1 ] shows a comparison of @xmath37 and @xmath68 during a time of steady reconnection ( @xmath20 closely follows @xmath37 in this case and so is not plotted ) .",
    "the magnetic field and pressure tensor components were averaged over @xmath72 electron larmor orbits and 4 gridpoints ( @xmath71 ) in each direction before computing the gyrotropy measures .",
    "equation [ qcalc ] was used to calculate @xmath37 ; @xmath16 was calculated from the formulas given in appendix a of @xcite . in order to minimize subjectivity , no data manipulation ( e.g. , noise rejection ) , other than the spatial and temporal averaging , was performed .",
    "only a fraction of the simulation domain is pictured in order to highlight the regions exhibiting strong departures from gyrotropy . on the right - hand side of each image",
    "are the traces of two cuts , one through the x - point ( blue ) and the other @xmath73 downstream ( red ) .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath29 are significant near the x - point , although there are minor differences in the aspect ratio and structural details of the bright regions .",
    "the bifurcation at @xmath74 and @xmath75 mirrors that seen in the charge and current densities ( not shown ) and reflects the complicated dynamics of speiser particle orbits near the region of null field .",
    "the values within a few gridpoints of @xmath76 carry somewhat more uncertainty because gyrotropy is an ill - defined quantity when @xmath77 .",
    "while @xmath37 and @xmath68 both vary between @xmath17 and @xmath32 , the more meaningful comparison is between the asymptotic value of each cut , which gives a reasonable approximation of the inherent particle noise , and the peak value at the x - point .",
    "these are roughly equal for the two measures . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic separatrices ( red peaks ) are comparatively much weaker in @xmath16 and stronger in @xmath37 .",
    "the separatrices mark topological boundaries with , in principle , zero width .",
    "if the associated particle signatures exhibit scales near the larmor radius ( as is known to be the case around the x - line ) then the intermingling between the upstream and downstream plasmas should produce departures from gyrotropy there .",
    "both measures show humps just upstream of the x - point that indicate small departures from gyrotropy .",
    "these may arise from decreases in @xmath13 ( due to magnetic moment conservation ) followed by scattering to other components .",
    "another possibility is that beams of inflowing electrons , when superimposed on the base maxwellian , drive the total distribution function away from cylindrical symmetry .      as a second case we consider a force - free equilibrium where the initial density ( @xmath78 ) and temperatures ( @xmath79 ) have no spatial variations .",
    "the reconnecting field has the form @xmath80 , here with @xmath81 , but now the out - of - plane ( guide ) component @xmath82 varies so that @xmath83 is constant .",
    "the initial guide field is asymptotically @xmath18 and rises to @xmath84 at the current sheet s center .",
    "the domain has dimensions @xmath85 , the ion - to - electron mass ratio is @xmath86 , and the speed of light is 15 .",
    "the spatial grid has resolution @xmath87 , which implies 8 gridpoints per @xmath65 and @xmath72 per electron larmor radius in the maximum field .",
    "there are @xmath67 particles per cell for each species .",
    "images of @xmath37 ( panel a ) and @xmath68 ( panel b ) , in the same format as figure [ gyr1 ] , for the run described in section [ ff ] .",
    "the data have been averaged over @xmath88 . ]",
    "figure [ gyr2 ] , in the same format as figure [ gyr1 ] , shows the region near the x - point .",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath16 peak there , although again the morphologies in the downstream region exhibit differences .",
    "the asymmetry between the separatrices , a common feature of guide - field reconnection , is apparent . as in figure",
    "[ gyr1 ] , the cuts show that the separatrices are somewhat stronger in @xmath37 than in @xmath16 . in images of the entire domain ( not shown ) , the enhancement of @xmath37 on the upper - right and lower - left separatrices continues around nearly the entire exterior of the downstream magnetic island while @xmath16 quickly peters out .",
    "however , the strongest difference is in the background noise level . while the two measures have similar peak - to - background ratios for the simulation of section [ gemlike ]",
    ", here they differ by a factor of @xmath89 , with @xmath37 smoother than in figure [ gyr1 ] and @xmath16 noisier .",
    "the improvement in @xmath37 can be attributed to the strong guide field and its driving of the plasma towards gyrotropy .",
    "the indentation in the magnetic field lines at @xmath90 is a transient feature due to the interaction of the outflowing plasma and the remains of a small magnetic island expelled from the x - point earlier in the simulation .",
    "we have proposed a new , mathematically rigorous measure of the gyrotropy of an arbitrary pressure tensor and presented numerical simulations of 2.5d reconnection demonstrating that gyrotropy violations peak near magnetic topological boundaries . testing the efficacy of @xmath29 in three - dimensional simulations and with spacecraft data are obvious next steps .",
    "it is unlikely that any single diagnostic can unfailingly and unambiguously identify reconnection sites in spacecraft data , but @xmath29 offers a complementary approach to methods based on other measurements .",
    "the calculation of @xmath29 requires the full electron pressure tensor ",
    "available , for instance , on the recently launched magnetospheric multiscale mission  and can be easily performed in any coordinate system using the algorithm presented in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "while @xmath29 has some similarities to previously proposed measures , particularly the non - gyrotropy parameter @xmath20 of @xcite , there are pressure tensors ( e.g. , equation [ au_ex ] ) for which @xmath20 does not correctly characterize the gyrotropy . however ,",
    "in many instances the two give similar results .",
    "their ratio can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the right - hand side takes its minimal value for @xmath93 and only varies by @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "although the ratio can become arbitrarily large when @xmath96 , approaching that limit in a real system will trigger other effects .",
    "of particular note is the firehose mode , for which the linear instability criterion is @xmath97 . under normal circumstances plasmas",
    "can not significantly exceed this threshold , which thus implies @xmath98 . as a consequence ,",
    "the differences between @xmath20 and @xmath37 are starkest for @xmath99 .",
    "( this argument is strictly only applicable for gyrotropic plasmas because they are assumed in deriving the firehose stability boundary .",
    "it should be a reasonable approximation when the pressure tensor is near gyrotropy , but significant off - diagonal components will likely modify the instability threshold . )    the differences between @xmath29 and the agyrotropy @xmath16 are more significant .",
    "the latter only quantifies one type of departure from gyrotropy , the breaking of cylindrical symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , while the former handles the general case .",
    "of more pressing interest to the interpretation of simulations and observations , however , is how well the measures identify regions of interesting magnetic topology .",
    "both successfully illuminate x - lines for the simulations presented here , but @xmath29 does a better job of tracing magnetic separatrices , particularly in guide - field reconnection .",
    "further analysis is necessary to make these comparisons quantitative .",
    "finally , an interesting connection exists between @xmath5 and the inertia tensor of a rigid body .",
    "since both are symmetric and positive semi - definite , a measure analogous to @xmath29 also exists for the former . to be relevant , however , something external to the body",
    "must define a preferred direction in a manner similar to the role the magnetic field plays in defining gyrotropy .",
    "we would like to acknowledge helpful conversations with k. schoeffler .",
    "this work was supported by nasa grant nnx14af42 g .",
    "beginning with a pressure tensor in an arbitrary coordinate system , the calculation of @xmath29 from equation [ agyro ] requires a transformation into a frame in which the diagonal components are in gyrotropic form .",
    "a tensor @xmath100 transforms under coordinate rotations according to the prescription @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a rotation matrix . both the symmetry of @xmath100 and its eigenvalues are preserved after rotation of the coordinate axes .    as an example",
    ", we demonstrate that , beginning with a pressure tensor of the form @xmath103 it is always possible to find a coordinate system in which the final two diagonal entries are equal . to do so , rotate around the magnetic field direction with the rotation matrix @xmath104 calculating @xmath105 and setting the second and third diagonal components equal gives the required angle : @xmath106 in the new frame the final two diagonal components are @xmath107 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements must also be known in the new coordinate system in order to compute @xmath29 .",
    "although explicit expressions for them can be calculated , the algebra is somewhat tedious .",
    "an easier method relies on the fact that certain combinations of tensor elements are invariant under coordinate rotations . through their use ,",
    "@xmath29 can be computed when @xmath5 is known in any coordinate system . in particular , a @xmath108 tensor with elements @xmath109 in an arbitrary cartesian system with coordinates @xmath110 has three invariants , two of which are the trace @xmath111 and the sum of principal minors @xmath112 for symmetric matrices @xmath113 and the final three terms of @xmath114 simplify .",
    "the third invariant , not used here , is the determinant .    with these definitions @xmath29",
    "can be expressed in terms of @xmath115 , @xmath114 , and the parallel pressure @xmath12 .",
    "the latter can be calculated from @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the @xmath118 component of the unit vector aligned with the local magnetic field .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , @xmath119 with this formula @xmath29 can be simply computed in an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system , without need for coordinate transformations and the associated matrix multiplications ."
