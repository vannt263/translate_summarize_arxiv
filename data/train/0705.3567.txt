    "the heavy fermion compound ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 shows a well defined electron spin resonance ( esr ) signal which features properties similarly observed for local yb@xmath1 ions in metallic environments @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this signal was observed at resonance energies much smaller than the kondo energy and well _ below _ the kondo temperature @xmath4  k , where the magnetic yb@xmath1 moments are supposed to be largely screened and esr silent .",
    "this seemingly contradiction is an important , yet unexplained feature of the magnetism in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "this compound is located very close to a magnetic field induced quantum critical point where weak antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering is suppressed in a field of 70  mt applied in the magnetic easy tetragonal @xmath5 plane @xcite .",
    "besides the af order at @xmath6  mk pronounced ferromagnetic fluctuations are evident from a highly enhanced sommerfeld - wilson ratio @xcite and from the spin dynamics as seen in @xmath7si nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "+ the existence of the esr in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 below @xmath8 seems even more surprising when its local character is envisaged : besides its weiss - like temperature dependence of the intensity it shows a pronounced anisotropy which perfectly agrees with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , results of @xmath9yb mssbauer experiments provided the most direct evidence that the observed esr line is much to narrow to be assigned to local yb@xmath1 spin dynamics @xcite . on the other hand , assuming the local moments to be kondo screened , conduction carriers themselves could cause a narrow and intense esr signal because strong ferromagnetic fluctuations are present .",
    "this kind of conduction electron spin resonance is reported , for instance , in pd @xcite or in tibe@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ with this paper we highlight how both scenarios ( local / itinerant ) characterize the esr spectra . for this purpose",
    "we present ( i ) an estimation of the esr intensity which is involved in the ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 esr compared to the local yb@xmath1 esr of ypd3:yb and ( ii ) a discussion of the lineshape s itinerant character which may be seen if spin diffusion is relevant in the relaxation process . for the latter we also investigated the esr of mono - isotopic @xmath3ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 in order to take into account eventual contributions from unresolved hyperfine lines .",

    "the esr experiments were performed at x  band frequencies ( @xmath13  ghz ) with a bruker elexsys 500 spectrometer .",

    "the latter was prepared before in an induction furnace because the usage of pure yb metal would lead to a considerable yb loss due to its high vapour pressure .",
    "debye - scherrer x - ray diffraction confirmed a single - phase sample .",
    "a yb concentration of 0.6% was determined by squid magnetization measurements .",
    "we first address the question how much intensity is involved in the ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 - esr compared to the esr of a well localized yb ion , y@xmath19yb@xmath20pd@xmath2 , x=0.6% .",
    "the latter compound is suitable for this comparison because it displays esr properties typical of a local yb@xmath1 magnetic moment .",
    "the esr linewidth is well characterized by a korringa ( temperature linear ) relaxation and a first excited ( @xmath21 ) level at @xmath22  k. the temperature independent effective @xmath23-factor of 3.34 is compatible with a doublet @xmath24 groundstate @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] it is already clear at first sight that the esr of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 can not be caused by a few percent of local yb@xmath1 moments .",

    "this scaling provides evidence that the lattice relaxation of a strongly coupled yb@xmath1  conduction electron system is an important ingredient for understanding the esr linewidth in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "this situation resembles the bottleneck - relaxation mechanism which was discussed extensively for diluted magnetic moments in metallic hosts @xcite .",
    "+ from a putative esr of a strongly coupled yb@xmath1  conduction electron system one would expect typical features of an itinerant esr probe .",

    "applying dyson s lineshape , we found that the spectra can not be described better when using a finite spin diffusion time .",
    "hence , the observed lineshape seems to agree well with the limit of infinite spin diffusion in dyson s formalism which corresponds to the usual metallic lorentzian lineshape of local moments in metals .",

    "[ fig3]a , a close - up view of the esr line flanks reveals systematic differences between a metallic lorentzian fit and the data .",

    "although the particular parameters of the lines are different their lineshapes agree very well since both spectra can be scaled on top of each other as described in the text .",
    "this demonstrates that no hyperfine structures due to yb nuclear spins contribute to the lineshape.,width=302 ]    we also checked whether the lineshape distortion arises from unresolved hyperfine line - splitting in the esr of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 with mixed yb isotopes . a hyperfine line - splitting",
