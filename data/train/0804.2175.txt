    "the canonical x - ray afterglow light curve containing five components after the prompt emission phase is a great finding of swift ( chincarini et al .",

    "the first of the five is the so - called `` steep decay phase '' which generally extends to @xmath2 , with a temporal decay slope typically @xmath3 or much steeper ( vaughan et al .",
    "2006 ; cusumano et al . 2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) .    a hint in this phase suggesting the emission of high latitude fireball surface is that it is typically smoothly connected to the prompt emission phase ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ;",
    "barthelmy et al . 2005 ; liang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "generally , the steep decay phase was interpreted as a consequence of the so - called curvature effect ( fenimore et al .",

    "the curvature effect is a combined effect that includes the delay of time and the shifting of the intrinsic spectrum as well as other relevant factors of an expanding fireball ( see qin et al .",
    "2006 for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the effect was intensively studied recently in the prompt gamma - ray phase , where the profile of the full light curve of pulses , the spectral lags , the power - law relation between the pulse width and energy , and the evolution of the hardness ratio curve are concerned ( sari & piran 1997 ; qin 2002 ; ryde & petrosian 2002 ; kocevski et al . 2003",

    "as early as a decade ago , fenimore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that , due to the curvature effect , light curves arising from the emission of an infinitely thin shell would be a power - law of observational time when the rest - frame photon number spectrum is a power - law and the emission is within an infinitesimal time interval . in this case , the two power - law indexes are related by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the light curve index and @xmath6 the spectral index . in concerning the x - ray afterglow emission ,",
    "kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) also found that , due to the curvature effect , the light curve of a shocked heated fireball shell radiating with a power - law spectrum within the observational band ( i.e. , the x - ray band in the early afterglow observation ) is a power - law of time as well and relation @xmath4 holds in this situation .",
    "as revealed in fig .",
    "7 of nousek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , relation @xmath4 is roughly in agreement with the data in the steep decay phase of some swift bursts .",
    "however , the figure also shows that real relations between the two indexes of some bursts significantly deviate from the @xmath4 curve .",
    "this might be due to the ill re - setting of time that should be set to the real time when the central engine restarts ( see liang et al .",
    "in addition , more or less subtracting the underlying afterglow contribution would lead to other values of the temporal index @xmath5 ( for a detailed explanation , see zhang 2007 ) .",
    "we notice that the derivation of relation @xmath4 in previous papers is based on the main part of the curvature effect .",
    "does it still hold ( or , in what situation it would still hold ) when the full curvature effect is considered ?",
    "this motivates our investigation below .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a general analysis on the full curvature effect in cases when the intrinsic emission is a power - law . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss light curves of power - law emission associated with several typical intrinsic temporal profiles .",
    "presented in section 4 is an example of application of our model .",
    "conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "observation of the emission arising from an expending fireball would be influenced by the delay of time of different areas of the fireball surface , the variation of the intensity due to the growing of the fireball radius , the variation of the time contracted factor and the shifting of the intrinsic spectrum associated with the angle to the line of sight .",
    "taking all these factors into account , one comes to a full knowledge of the so - called curvature effect ( see also qin et al .",

    "quantity @xmath34 is nothing but the traveling time of the fireball surface from the explosion spot to @xmath32 , contracted by factor @xmath35 since the area of @xmath36 moves towards the observer with lorentz factor @xmath37 .",

    "however , what we discuss here is the steep decay phase of early x - ray afterglow which was generally assumed to arise from high latitude emission . in this situation ,",
    "the variation of this term would be significant .    according to ( 11 ) , another noticeable term , @xmath65 $ ] , in equation ( 1 ) or ( 13 ) reflects the shifting of frequency .",
    "equation ( 11 ) suggests that the flux observed at frequency @xmath66 and time @xmath27 will be contributed by rest - frame photons of frequency @xmath67 emitted at proper time @xmath68 ( note that the flux will also be contributed by rest - frame photons of other frequency @xmath69 emitted at other proper time @xmath70 so long as they satisfy equation ( 11 ) , and the value of the flux is determined by all these possible photons ) .",

    "the last factor affecting the profile of light curves is the integral range of equation ( 13 ) .",
    "the integral range might differ from time to time since the fireball surface area that sends photons to the observer , which are observed at time @xmath27 , might change with time .",
    "shown in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined by observation time @xmath27 .",

    "the power - law curve is a tail falling off speedily due to the effect of the @xmath63 term .",
    "a remarkable feature revealed by the figure is that the power - law decay time is solely determined by and very sensitive to the radius of the fireball and the power - law range itself can tell how large is a fireball radius .",
    "for example , a power - law range being found to extend to @xmath83 must be larger than @xmath84 and that being found to extend to @xmath85 must be larger than @xmath86 .",
    "the conclusion is surprisingly to be independent of the lorentz factor .",

    "this constrains our application , since the spectra of many x - ray afterglows of grbs are found to vary with time and the corresponding light curves are found not to follow the @xmath0 curve ( see zhang et al .",

    ", one must find a burst with its spectral index being constant and its light curve following ( or approximately following ) the @xmath0 curve in its x - ray afterglow .",
    "after checking the data provided in web - site http://grb.physics.unlv.edu ( up to march 25 , 2008 ) , we find that grb 050219a might be one that fits our simple model .",
    "the data show , the spectral index does not vary with time and its mean is @xmath152 .",
    "in addition , the first decay curve of the bust is a power - law curve with its index being approximately @xmath134 .",
    "this phase is followed by a shallow one which starts at about @xmath153 . comparing this light curve with those presented in fig .",
    "3 , we guess , if it is due to the curvature effect , the fireball radius must be larger than @xmath125 , otherwise the start time of the shallow phase would be too small to meet the data ( see the left panels of figs .",
    "3a , 3b and 3c ) .",
    "if the radius is @xmath154 , then the lorentz factor must be larger than @xmath155 , otherwise the start time of the shallow phase would be too large ( see the right upper panels of figs .",
    "3a , 3b and 3c ) . revealed in fig .",
    "3 , there are four factors affecting the start time of the shallow phase : the fireball radius @xmath156 ; the lorentz factor @xmath37 ; the intrinsic temporal power - law emission index @xmath135 ; and the start time of the intrinsic temporal power - law emission @xmath136 .",
    "available in the mentioned web - site , there are 75 data points in the xrt light curve of grb 050219a . as an example of fitting , we ignore the three data points with the largest time scales since the gap between them and the majority of the data set is too large and the domain showing a constant spectral index does not cover them ( see http://grb.physics.unlv.edu ) ( in this way , one can not tell if the spectral index in the corresponding time scale is still constant ) . with the rest 72 data points , we need only apply the equations adopted in the discussion of the case of the temporal profile of the intrinsic emission being a power - law function of time and the power - law decay time being infinity .",
    "the equations adopted in producing fig . 3 are employed to fit the data set , where the term @xmath157 , which dominates the magnitude of the theoretical curve , would be determined by fit .",
    "since both the fireball radius and the lorentz factor are sensitive to the time scale of the start time of the shallow phase , we deal with them one by one .",
    "we first fix the lorentz factor and assume it to be @xmath158 , allowing @xmath156 and @xmath135 to vary since not only the start time of the shallow phase should be met but also the power - law index of the shallow phase should be accounted for . in addition , we take @xmath142 since @xmath136 is less sensitive to the start time of the shallow phase ( see the right panels of figs .",
    "3a , 3b and 3c ) .",
    "the best fitting curve is shown in fig .",
    "one finds that the xrt data of grb 050219a can be roughly accounted for by a power - law temporal emission from an expanding fireball surface .",
    "note that the corresponding fitting parameters are not important since other possibilities exist ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "next , we fix the fireball radius and take it as @xmath137 ( in fact , we take @xmath79 which corresponds to @xmath74 ) , allowing @xmath37 and @xmath135 to vary . also , we take @xmath142 .",
    "the best fit is displayed in fig .",
    "it shows that the result of the fit with a fixed fireball radius is hard to be distinguished from that with a fixed lorentz factor .",
    "therefore , the resulting fitting parameters are not important in this stage of investigation .",
    "there is a third choice : one could fix @xmath135 and allow @xmath156 and @xmath37 to vary .",

    "the @xmath162 of the fit is @xmath167.,width=480 ]",
    "we investigate in this paper how an intrinsic emission with a power - law spectrum @xmath168 emitting from an expanding fireball surface gives rise to an observed flux density when the full curvature effect is considered .",
    "we find that , if the power - law spectrum of the intrinsic radiation holds within the energy range that corresponds to the observed energy channel due to the doppler shifting , the resulting spectrum would be a power - law as well and the index will be exactly the same as that in the intrinsic spectrum , regardless the real form of the temporal profile of the intrinsic emission . accompanied with the power law spectrum of index @xmath6 is a power law light curve with index @xmath169 , expected by the curvature effect , which was known previously ( see fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "this light curve could be observed if the intrinsic emission is extremely short or if the emission arises from an exponential cooling .    in particular , we assume and consider a power - law cooling emission in the co - moving frame ( for this emission , the intrinsic temporal profile is a power - law ) .",
    "we find that , if the power - law decay time being infinity , due to the contribution of the power - law cooling in the co - moving frame , the observed light curve influenced by the full curvature effect contains two phases : one is a rapid decay phase where the light curve well follows the well - known @xmath0 curve , and the other is a shallow decay phase where the light curve is obviously shallower than that in the rapid decay phase .",
    "if the power - law decay time is limited , there would be several kinds of light curve .",
    "a remarkable one among them contains three power - law phases ( see figs .",
    "4 - 7 ) : the first is a rapid one with its index being equal to or larger than that of the @xmath0 curve ; the second is a shallow decay one with its index being obviously smaller than that in the first phase ; and the third is a rapid decay one with its index being equal to or less than that of the first phase . it might be possible that , some of the grbs containing such features in their afterglow light curves are due to expanding fireballs or face - on uniform jets ( see e.g. qin et al .",
    "2004 ) emitting with a power - law spectrum and a power - law cooling ( being infinity or limited ) .",
    "in the view of co - moving observers , the dynamic process of the merger of shells would be somewhat similar to that occurred in the external shocks ( the main difference is that in the case of inner shocks , a co - moving observer observes only a limited volume of medium for which the density would evolve with time due to the enhancement of the fireball surface ) . based on this argument , we suspect that the intrinsic emission of some of those bursts possessing in their early x - ray afterglows a rapid decay phase soon followed by a shallow decay phase and then a rapid decay one might be somewhat similar to the well - known standard forward shock model ( sari et al . 1998 ; granot et al .",
    "1999 ) ; while for some of the bursts with a rapid phase followed by a shallow phase in their late x - ray afterglows the emission might be that of the standard forward shock model influenced by the curvature effect .",
    "necessary conditions for perceiving this mechanism include : a ) during the period concerned , the spectral index should be constant ; b ) the temporal index in the first phase should be equal to or larger than that of the @xmath0 curve .    as an example of application , we employ the xrt data of grb 050219a to perform a fit since the spectral index @xmath6 of this burst does not vary with time and the first decay phase of its light curve is a power - law one with its index being approximately @xmath134 .",
    "the result shows that the xrt data of this burst can be roughly accounted for by a power - law temporal emission from an expanding fireball surface .",
    "since there exist various possibilities , parameters obtained by the fit are not unique . to determine the parameters , we need other independent estimations .",
    "according to the analysis above , a reliable value of the fireball radius would be obtained if one observes a `` cut - off '' feature following the @xmath0 curve in the case of a constant spectral index @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , the start time of the shallow phase could raise a limit to the fireball radius ( see figs .",
    "3 - 7 ) . for grb 050219a ,",
    "if its xrt data are indeed due to the curvature effect , its radius corresponding to this emission must be larger than @xmath170 .",
    "we have checked that taking @xmath171 ( which corresponds to @xmath172 ) , @xmath173 and @xmath174 can also roughly account for the data .",
    "as the lorentz factor is so small in this situation , we conclude that , if the x - ray afterglow of grb 050219a does arise from the emission of an expanding fireball surface , the radius of the fireball associated with this emission would not be much less than @xmath175 , otherwise @xmath37 would be too small to be regarded as a relativistic motion .",
    "why a shallow phase emerges due to the curvature effect ? we guess , while the first phase is dominated by the geometric effect and therefore obeys the @xmath0 curve , in the shallow phase the intrinsic emission overcomes the geometric effect and dominates the light curve observed .",
    "one might notice the @xmath126 lines ( the dash dot lines ) in fig . 3  the shallow phase curve of these lines is parallel to the time axis . as the radius grows linearly with time when a constant lorentz factor is assumed",
    "( see qin 2002 ) , the emission from the fireball surface of a certain solid angle increases as a square of time ( the area of the surface is proportional to @xmath176 ) .",
    "this in turn makes the total emission of @xmath177 from the surface becoming constant .",
    "when the intrinsic emission overcomes the geometric effect in the shallow phase , one can not expect a light curve of @xmath178 , but instead , we expect that of @xmath179 ( see fig .",
    "it is known that a @xmath50-function intensity approximates the process of an extremely short emission .",
    "this will occur when the corresponding fireball shells are very thin and the cooling time is relatively short compared with the curvature time scale ( for the time scale of the curvature effect , see kocevski et al .",
    "2003 and qin & lu 2005 ) .",
    "two light curve characteristics are associated with a quasi-@xmath64-function emission .",
    "the first is a strict power - law decay curve with index @xmath134 .",
    "the second is the limited time range of this curve . if the cooling time is not so short but it is an exponential one , then these characteristics are also expected ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . note that the exponential cooling time does not last the @xmath0 curve to a much larger time scale when the cooling itself is not very large ( say , in the case of @xmath154 , @xmath180 ; see fig .",
    "thus , one can estimate the fireball radius from bursts possessing these characteristics ( note that , the time scale of the @xmath0 curve is independent of the lorentz factor ; see equations ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) ) . for candidates of this kind of burst",
    ", we propose to fit the spectrum with @xmath181 and the light curve with @xmath182(t - t_{0})^{-(2+\\beta ) } $ ] , where both @xmath183 and @xmath184 are free parameters .",
    "when the fitting is good enough , we say that the intrinsic fireball emission is likely very short or the cooling is an exponential one and the corresponding fireball radius is @xmath185 .",
    "when the expansion of the fireball is relativistic , we get @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , via this method , one obtains at least the upper limit of the fireball radius as long as the intrinsic emission is extremely short , or the cooling is an exponential one , and the intrinsic spectrum is a power - law .    in the case of the intrinsic temporal power - law emission ,",
    "when its temporal index is large enough ( @xmath187 ) , there would be a `` cutoff '' curve located exactly at the same time position of the speedily falling off tail in the light curve of a @xmath64-function emission .",
    "this feature could be used to estimate the fireball radius as well .",
    "presented in zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , several bursts seem to possess this `` cutoff '' feature : grb050724 , grb060211a , grb060218 , grb060427 , grb060614 , grb060729 and grb060814 . if the proposed interpretation can be applied , their radius would be that ranging from @xmath84 to @xmath86 . at lease one reason prevents us to reach such a conclusion .",
    "the spectra of these bursts happen to vary quite significantly within the light curves associated with this feature .",
    "this conflicts with what we assume in this paper ( we assume a constant intrinsic spectrum ) .",
    "we thus appeal further investigation of this issue taking into account the variation of the intrinsic spectrum , which might tell us whether the `` cutoff '' feature remains and/or its properties are maintained .    displayed in literature ,",
    "many swift bursts are found to possess a bent light curve instead of a strict power - law one , in the early x - ray afterglow ( see , e.g. , chincarini et al . 2005 ; liang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) . in our analysis above",
    ", we seldom get bent light curves",
    ". this must be due to the fact that the model concerned is too simple , where we consider only emissions with constant spectra . when the intrinsic spectrum varies with time",
    ", one would expect bursts with both variable spectra and bent light curves ( the well - known @xmath0 curve suggests that light curves of fireballs are strongly affected by the corresponding emission spectra ) .",
    "indeed , we find that both variable spectra and bent light curves happen to appear in the same period for many swift bursts ( see zhang et al .",
    "2007 and the unlv grb group web - site http://grb.physics.unlv.edu ) .    since for some bursts",
    "their early x - ray afterglow spectra evolve with time while for some others their spectra have no significant temporal evolution ( zhang et al . 2007 ; butler & kocevski 2007b ) , we suspect that there might be two kinds of mechanism accounting for the x - ray afterglow emission .",
    "it seems likely that the observed variation of spectra is due to an intrinsic spectral evolution .",
    "the intrinsic spectral evolution would probably lead to deviations of the light curves studied above ( those studied in figs .",
    "we thus suspect that the bursts with no spectral evolution might have `` normal '' temporal profiles , while others might exhibit somewhat `` abnormal '' profiles .",
    "this seems to be the case according to figs . 1 - 3 in zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and figs .",
    "7 - 8 in butler & kocevski ( 2007b ) .",
    "our simple model tends to account for the kind of bursts that their x - ray afterglow spectra do not evolved with time",
    ". however , for many bursts with roughly constant spectra and power - law light curves , the curves are too shallow to be accounted for by the @xmath0 curve ( see http://grb.physics.unlv.edu ) .",
    "our model seems too simple to account for the majority of xrt light curve data of swift bursts .",
    "it is therefore necessary to explore more complicated cases .",
    "for example , a variant lorentz factor ( which is expectable when the intrinsic emission is long enough ) might play a role . would it affect the slope of the decaying curve ?",
    "we are looking forward to see more investigations on this issue in the near future .    before ending this paper",
    ", we would like to point out that quantity @xmath188 is the co - moving time measured by a co - moving observer when the fireball radius reaches @xmath32 ( see qin 2002 ) . note that , @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , when assigning @xmath190 , @xmath191 means @xmath106 co - moving time has passed after @xmath192 .",
    "when one analyzes the emission associated with @xmath193 , @xmath194 refers only the emission at @xmath190 which is the co - moving time when @xmath192 .",
    "although we take quite small values of @xmath136 in the above analysis , it does not correspond to early emission when we adopt @xmath193 or @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , our analysis on emission from fireballs with @xmath196 does not put forward any constraint on the prompt emission .",
