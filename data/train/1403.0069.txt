    "the quantum adiabatic theorem ( qat )  @xcite suggests that a physical system initialized in an eigenstate  @xmath0 ( commonly the ground state ) of a certain gapped time - dependent hamiltonian  @xmath1 , with an eigenvalue @xmath2 , at time @xmath3 remains in the same instantaneous eigenstate ( up to a multiplicative phase factor ) , provided that the hamiltonian  @xmath1 varies in a continuous and sufficiently slow way .",
    "the adiabatic theorem was first proposed by born and fock at the dawn of quantum mechanics  @xcite , who were motivated by the idea of adiabatic invariants of ehrenfest  @xcite . born and",
    "fock s result is restricted to bounded hamiltonians with discrete energy levels , e.g. 1d harmonic oscillators ; their result is not applicable to systems with a continuous spectrum e.g. hydrogen atom .",
    "this restriction was relaxed by kato in 1950  @xcite , who found that in the adiabatic limit , the time evolution of a time - dependent hamiltonian is equivalent to a geometric evolution .",
    "kato s result is applicable to systems including hydrogen atom , where the ground state is unique and has a gap from the excited states that can have degeneracy .",
    "later , the requirement of the existence of a gap for proving the adiabatic theorem was found to be unnecessary  @xcite .",
    "this intriguing physical property of quantum adiabaticity finds many interesting applications , including but not limited to quantum field theory  @xcite , geometric phase  @xcite , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite , energy level crossings in molecules  @xcite , adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite , quantum simulation ( see e.g. the review  @xcite ) , and other applications  @xcite .      despite its long history ,",
    "the study of the qat is still a very active field of research .",
    "many works have been performed aiming to achieve a better understanding of the adiabatic theorem . in particular , the problem of quantifying the slowness of adiabatic evolution has not been completely solved .",
    "traditionally  @xcite the so - called ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) quantitative adiabatic condition ( qac ) or simply quantitative condition ( for _ all _ @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 was meant to quantify the slowness of @xmath1 ( see [ app : ham_eigen ] for details on the definitions of the hamiltonian and eigenvectors ) .",
    "however , qac was numerically shown to be not a good indicator for revealing the fidelity of the final state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that qac is inconsistent with the qat  @xcite and insufficient for maintaining the validity of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite , except for some special cases  @xcite .",
    "the arguments for showing the inconsistency and insufficiency of qac were constructed  @xcite from a comparison between two systems , a and b , where a was evolved under a hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 of system b is related to that of system a through a unitary transformation @xmath8 that corresponds to the exact propagator of @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown that both systems a and b satisfy the qac , but only one of them can fulfill the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results performed in an nmr experiment  @xcite .",
    "many studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) have been made trying to understand the inconsistency raised by marzlin and sanders  @xcite .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that resonant transitions between energy levels are responsible for the violations of the adiabatic theorem . a refined adiabatic condition has been found  @xcite , which takes into account the effects of resonant energy - level transitions .",
    "on the other hand , the validity of the adiabatic theorem was analyzed from a perturbative - expansion approach  @xcite , which provides a diagrammatic representation for adiabatic dynamics and yields the quantitative condition ( in eq .",
    "( [ q - cond-1 ] ) ) as the first - order approximation .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that the quantitative condition is insufficient for the adiabatic approximation when the hamiltonian varies rapidly but with a small amplitude .",
    "furthermore , generalizing qac for open quantum systems  @xcite and many - body systems  @xcite have been achieved .",
    "efforts for finding conditions that can replace qac were made  @xcite .",
    "another line of research related to the adiabatic theorem is to estimate or bound the scaling of the final - state fidelity . under some general conditions for a gapped hamiltonian",

    "<S> the quantitative adiabatic condition ( qac ) , or quantitative condition , is a convenient ( a priori ) tool for estimating the adiabaticity of quantum evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the range of the applicability of qac is not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that qac can become insufficient for guaranteeing the validity of the adiabatic approximation , but under what conditions the qac would become necessary has become controversial . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is believed that the inability for the qac to reveal quantum adiabaticity is due to induced resonant transitions . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear how to quantify these transitions in general . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a progress to this problem by finding an exact relation that can reveal how transition amplitudes are related to qac directly . as a posteriori condition for quantum adiabaticity , </S>",
    "<S> our result is universally applicable to any ( nondegenerate ) quantum system and gives a clear picture on how qac could become insufficient or unnecessary for the adiabatic approximation , which is a problem that has gained considerable interest in the literature in recent years .    </S>",
