    "matter in compact stars has a wide range of density and a variety of chemical components . at the crust region of neutron stars",
    ", there exists a region where the density is lower than the normal nuclear density @xmath2@xmath3 over a couple of hundreds meters .",
    "the pressure of such matter is provided by degenerate electrons , since baryons are clustered into nuclei to form the coulomb lattice and have little contribution to the pressure . in the inner region , pressure becomes high and density increases up to several times @xmath4 .",
    "charge - neutral matter mainly consists of neutrons and the equal number of protons and electrons under chemical equilibrium . since the kinetic energy of degenerate electrons is much higher than that of baryons , the electron fraction ( or the proton one ) decreases with increase of density and thus neutrons become the main component and drip out of the nuclei . in this way",
    "baryons as well as electrons come to contribute to the pressure . at a certain density",
    ", other components such as hyperons and mesons may emerge .",
    "for example , negative kaon condensation , expected to be of a first - order phase transition ( fopt ) , remarkably softens the eos of matter . at even higher density ,",
    "hadron - quark deconfinement transition may occur and quarks in hadrons are liberated .",
    "this phase transition is also considered to be of first - order .",
    "a fopt brings about a thermodynamic instability of uniform matter to have phase separation . in other words",
    ", matter should have the nonuniform mixed phase ( mp ) around the critical density .",
    "since nuclear matter consists of two chemically independent components , i.e.  baryons and electrons , the equalities of both baryon and electron chemical potentials between two phases are required by the gibbs conditions in the mp .",
    "therefore the eos of the mp can not be obtained simply by the maxwell construction , which is valid only for single component .",
    "the components in nuclear matter are electrically charged , so that the local charge neutrality is no more held in the mp . to minimize the surface energy plus the coulomb energy , which are called as the finite - size effects",
    ", matter is expected to form a structured mixed phase ( smp ) , i.e.  a lattice made of lumps of one phase with a geometrical symmetry embedded in the other phase .",
    "the coulomb interaction plays a minor role in determining the relative volume ratio of two phases , but it becomes important to determine the size of the structure .",
    "so we must carefully treat it in the study of the mp by taking into account the charge screening effect .    at very low densities ,",
    "nuclei in matter are expected to form the coulomb lattice embedded in the electron sea . with increase of density ,",
    "`` nuclear pasta '' structures emerge as a smp @xcite in the liquid - gas phase transition , where stable nuclear shape may change from droplet to rod , slab , tube , and to bubble .",
    "pasta nuclei are eventually dissolved into uniform matter at a certain nucleon density below the saturation density @xmath4 .",
    "the name `` pasta '' comes from rod and slab structures figuratively spoken as `` spaghetti '' and `` lasagna '' .",
    "such low - density nuclear matter exists in the collapsing stage of supernovae and in the crust of neutron stars .",
    "the smp is also expected in the phase transitions at higher densities , like kaon condensation and hadron - quark phase transition . there , the charge screening effect may be pronounced since the local charge density can be high .    our purpose here is to investigate pasta structures of mp self - consistently within the mean - field approximation . in particular , we figure out how the coulomb screening and the surface tension affect the property of the mp .",
    "first we investigate the property of low - density nuclear matter at zero temperature .",
    "we employ the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model to describe the properties of nuclear matter under consideration . the rmf model with fields of mesons and baryons introduced in a lorentz - invariant way",
    "is not only relatively simple for numerical calculations , but also sufficiently realistic to reproduce bulk properties of finite nuclei as well as the saturation properties of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "one characteristics of our framework is that the coulomb interaction is properly included in the equations of motion for nucleons and electrons and for meson mean fields . thus the baryon and electron density profiles , as well as the meson mean fields , are determined in a fully consistent way with the coulomb interaction .    to solve the equations of motion for the fields numerically , we divided the whole space into equivalent wigner - seitz cells with geometrical symmetry .",
    "the shape of the cell changes as sphere in three - dimensional ( 3d ) case , cylinder in 2d and slab in 1d .",
    "each cell is globally charge - neutral and all physical quantities in the cell are smoothly connected to those of the next cell with zero gradients at the boundary .",
    "the coupled equations for fields in a cell are solved by a relaxation method for a given baryon - number density under constraints of the global charge neutrality .",
    "parameters included in the rmf model are chosen to reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter , and the binding energies and the proton ratios of nuclei .",
    "details of the numerical procedure are explained in refs .  @xcite .",
    "here , we present our results on nuclear matter with a fixed proton fraction @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and nuclear matter in beta - equilibrium . figure [ proffixfull ] shows some typical density profiles inside the wigner - seitz cells with the 3d geometry .",
    "the horizontal axis in each panel denotes the radial distance from the center of the cell .",
    "the cell boundary is indicated by the hatch .",
    "these density distributions exhibit nuclear `` droplets '' among five kinds of `` pasta '' structures . in symmetric matter ( @xmath7 )",
    ", two phases consist of nuclear liquid and electron gas .",
    "this is the specific case for @xmath8 , since both the phases include electron and nucleons at finite temperature . for the cases of @xmath9 and beta - equilibrium ,",
    "the neutron density is finite at any point : two phases consist of nuclear matter and dripped neutrons , besides electrons .",
    "due to the spatial rearrangement of electrons the electron density profile becomes inhomogeneous .",
    "this non - uniformity of the electron distribution is more pronounced for a higher @xmath10 and a higher density .",
    "protons repel each other .",
    "thereby the proton density profile substantially deviates from the uniform distribution .",
    "the eos with the sequence of the geometric structures is shown in fig .",
    "[ eosfixfull ] ( upper panels ) as a function of the averaged baryon - number density .",
    "note that the energy @xmath11 also includes the kinetic energy of electrons , which makes the total pressure positive .",
    "the lowest - energy configurations are selected among various geometrical structures . in the cases of fixed proton fraction , the most favorable configuration changes from the droplet to rod , slab , tube , bubble , and to the uniform one ( the dotted thin curve ) with an increase of density .",
    "the appearance of non - uniform structures in matter results in a softening of eos : the energy per baryon gets lower up to about 15 mev@xmath12 compared to uniform matter . in the case of beta - equilibrium , on the other hand , only the droplet configuration is seen for the mp",
    ". however , this is dependent on the interaction used in the calculation @xcite .",
    "the energy gain due to the appearance of non - uniform matter in beta - equilibrium case is rather small .",
    "let us explain the mechanism of clustering ( appearance of non - uniform matter ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figpartialpressure ] shows baryon partial pressure .",
    "the dotted curve and thin full curve shows the case of uniform matter .",
    "non - uniform structure ( pasta ) appears in the density region where uniform matter becomes unstable with negative partial pressure @xmath13 .",
    "then the resultant @xmath13 increases up to near zero .",
    "one should note there still remains a region where uniform matter has negative @xmath13 .",
    "this is due to the finite - size effects ( surface tension and the coulomb potential ) which make the pasta structure unstable .",
    "consider 3d case for simplicity .",
    "the coulomb energy par particle is proportional to second power of the droplet size , @xmath14 , and the surface energy per particle is proportional to its inverse , @xmath15 .",
    "then the sum @xmath16 has a minimum at a certain @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "however , the charge screening reduces the coulomb energy .",
    "this moves the minimum point to larger @xmath17 . at some density near @xmath4 ,",
    "the screening effect is strong and @xmath19 is reduced significantly .",
    "this extinguishes the minimum point and makes the pasta structure unstable .",
    "next we explore the case of finite temperature @xmath20 . for this",
    "we extend our framework of the previous section .",
    "for simplicity only the distribution functions of fermions are treated as @xmath21-dependent ; the momentum distribution function is a fermi - dirac distribution instead of a step function with a threshold at the fermi momentum . in the numerical calculation ,",
    "density , scalar density , and kinetic energy density , etc of a fermion @xmath22 are obtained by integrating the functions of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 over all the momentum - space .",
    "we store those values in tables and get necessary quantities by interpolating them .",
    "the contribution of anti - particles are neglected for simplicity .",
    "we have observed `` pasta '' structures again at finite but low temperatures .",
    "the difference from the @xmath8 case is that the low - density phase always contains some amount of protons and neutrons .",
    "the resultant eos ( baryon partial pressure as a function of baryon number density ) of symmetric nuclear matter at various temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "[ figpartialpressuret ] .",
    "dotted and thick solid curves show the cases of uniform matter , while thin solid curves are the cases where non - uniform structures are present .",
    "pasta structures appear at finite temperatures as well as the case of @xmath8 .",
    "but there appears uniform matter ( gas phase ) at the lowest - density region @xcite since the baryon partial pressure of uniform matter has a positive gradient against density . on the other hand ,",
    "the uniform matter is unstable where the pressure gradient is negative even if the pressure itself is positive . at @xmath25 mev",
    ", we obtain no pasta structure since the baryon partial pressure of uniform matter is a monotonic function of density .",
    "so the critical temperature lies between 10 and 20 mev .",
    "study of the ( spinodal ) instability of uniform matter is in progress .",
    "in the core region of neutron stars , first - order phase transitions such as meson condensation and quark deconfinement transition , etc are expected .",
    "we have investigated the similar pasta structures in such fopts .",
    "particularly the hadron - quark mp is a good example to show the effects of charge - screening .",
    "figure [ figeos - qh ] shows the eos of matter at hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "the appearance of mp significantly lower the energy of the system .",
    "the eos obtained by our calculation with pasta structures is close to that obtained by the maxwell construction shown by a thick black curve .",
    "this is due to the strong surface tension between two phases and the charge screening which makes the system approximately local - neutral .",
    "this situation is similar to that in the maxwell construction . on the other hand ,",
    "if the surface tension is weak , the size of the structure becomes small @xcite and consequently the coulomb interaction becomes ineffective .",
    "this situation corresponds to a bulk application of the gibbs conditions without the finite - size effects .    in conclusion",
    "we emphasize that the existence of pasta structures together with the above mentioned surface and the charge screening effects are common and general for the mps at the fopt in nuclear matter ."
